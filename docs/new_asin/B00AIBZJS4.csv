5426632,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I had seen the trailer for this movie a couple of times in the theater in recent weeks and couldn't wait to see this movie. Other than the trailer, I had no previous knowledge about what I could expect (I have never been to any Cirque du Soleil show before).

""Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D"" (91 min.) brings a very simple story line (girl meet boy (the Aerialist) at a circus, boy disappears into a bottomless pit, girl chases after boy and eventually she finds him) to various scenes from a smorgasbord of Cirque du Soleil shows. There is of course no dialogue, so the visuals and the music are key in any such movie. First as to the music, I thought it was rather bland and uneven, but then midway into the movie we get a huge chunk of Beatles songs (Blackbird; Octopus's Garden; Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds; For the Benefit of Mr. Kite; Get Back; and later also While My Guitar Gently Weeps as the credits start), and immediately the movie perks up for me. As to the performances, they are outstanding and at times jaw-dropping (I particularly liked the trampoline performances set to the Viva Elvis music, but also the extended closing aerial ballet piece between the 2 protagonists is outstanding).

Several comments: first, it wasn't until the credits started rolling that I realized this movie is in essence a ""greatest hits""/""best of"" Cirque du Soleil as it is made clear that all these scenes come from existing shows. Second, despite this being executive produced by James ""Avatar"" Cameron, I didn't feel like the 3D played all that an important role in enjoying the movie. Third, even though the running time is listed at 91 min., the end-credits are just about the longest I have ever seen and run close to 10 min. if you can believe that. Bottom line: although I enjoyed the movie and the visuals are at time stunning, it was not the ""over the top"" experience that I had expected after having seen the trailer some weeks ago. That said, I still have seeing Cirque du Soleil's ""The Beatles Love"" show on my bucket list!",1356307200,31,2037,4.578082191780822
5426633,5,B00AIBZJS4,"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE 3D BLU-RAY.

I will start this review the way I felt when I first saw it in the movie theater...

1. You have to LOVE Cirque Du Soleil. Not just ""like""...you have to love them.

2. Don't spend even one second trying to analyse the plot. It's about a young woman who is mesmerized with a young male aerialist and she tries to find him again when they are separated. Everything else are sections of different Las Vegas Cirque shows and even in their entirety don't always make sense. If you try to understand why this is here or that is there, you will run out screaming. Turn off your brain and just let your eyes enjoy all the spectacular.

3. It helps a lot to have seen at least a few of these shows in Las Vegas because the movie selects some of the best parts from each.  This will be sort of a video souvenir book for you.

4. Did I mention you have to LOVE Cirque du Soleil?

The thrilling sequences that the couple encounter individually are from the Las Vegas productions of ""O,"" ""Ka!"", ""The Beatles' Love,"" ""Mystere,"" ""Chris Angel's Believe,"" ""Zumanity,"" and ""Viva Elvis!""...and they come back together for a romantic aerial (updated from ""Ka!"").

The 3D was spectacular on the movie screen and I have absolutely no qualms about giving it a full 5 of 5 for the 3D Blu-ray.  Scenes from ""O"" will have you putting down towels in case of water spilling out of your TV.  There is excellent depth and a few really wonderful popouts.  Colors are glorious!!!

I have been to most of these shows in Las Vegas.  While I feel there is never ever any way to capture the experience of seeing them live, especially when performers fly overhead of you, this film does something that seeing it live never could: you will never see the performers this close up, no matter how good a seat you have.  The 3D cameras would occasionally be anywhere from 40 to 80 feet in the air, right there with the performers.

Audio is likewise a 5 out of 5.  Great sound all around the room.  (Speaking of music, my favorite Cirque show in Vegas is ""The Beatles' Love"" and there are about six scenes from it (with Beatles music in the film, too), including ""Get Back,"" ""Octopus's Garden,"" ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and the film ends with a group shot of curtain moments for the different show casts set to ""All You Need Is Love.""  ""Love"" fans, rejoice!)

Extras are really minimal and are located on the 2D Blu-ray disc.  A behind-the-scenes look with James Cameron that is only about 2-3 minutes long.  There is a featurette with star Erica Linz that looks at creating a series of acrobatic moves, and that 10-15 minutes is only minimally interesting.  The remaining extra is an ad for several Vegas Cirque shows.

For fans of Cirque du Soleil and 3D, this comes highly recommended.",1356048000,143,2862,4.472061657032755

I've seen a couple of these show in Vegas and Cirque does a top notch job. It's entertainment and stimulation of the imagination - nothing more than a break from reality. I'm not sure what the people giving this a low rating are really expecting but I have to say that I am super impressed and it will prompt me to go see more of the Cirque shows when opportunity presents itself.",1445990400,,506,4.5

5427002,3,B00AIBZJS4,"I have been a fan of Cirque for many years. They have done more for theatre and their influence is seen everywhere from ballet companies to small theatre companies. I love their work and what they do.
Unfortunately, it does not translate well to the big screen. So much is lost without live performance and good films require a different approach than what Cirque brings to the table.
This is essentially a series of acts from different shows loosely tied together.
See them live. It is the only way to truly experience their astonishing magic.",1444089600,,544,4.7368421052631575

You feel looking through a huge window on the performance on screen.  I love to watch and show off to my friends and relatives on my 120 inches diagonal projection screen.

5427067,4,B00AIBZJS4,"First time I haven't given Cirque Du Soleil a 5 star.  The visuals and soundtrack are as indescribable and mind boggling as ever.  This film tries to thread together bits and pieces from many of the different Cirque shows.  I understand this intention, but it surprisingly detracted.  It just didn't make any sense.  I would give this a 4.75 star if I could.

If you've never seen any of these shows, however, I would highly recommend you purchase this one - just don't try to follow it as a storyline.  Think of it as a Circque Du Soleil sampler.  You really must see this on a big screen - plug your device into your TV.",1437350400,,622,4.3478260869565215

5427190,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Spectacular stage design, Stunning visuals, Amazing choreography! It's acrobatics, theatre, music, dance, drama, fantasy, humour and more all rolled into one. Cirque du Soleil is not your typical entertainment. There is no single genre that can classify a Cirque show, whether it is touring in a tent, permanent in a theatre or as a movie. Don't see this as a typical movie with a plot, or musical, or theatre, or even circus, even though it does pride itself as a circus without animals. I have seen many Cirque shows and some several times over. I have never failed to be awestruck each time, and be filled with renewed respect for the actors and technical crew. There is no lead actor or supporting cast in Cirque, everyone is a star and everyone is a supporting actor. They need to have absolute trust in, and give unfailing support to each other for their own safety in their gravity and death-defying routines, such precision, concentration and determination, to do it ""live"" over and over again everyday. Cirque du Soleil takes your breath away, there are so many elements of surprises that keep you engaged and entertained. While it is artistic and weird (to many), it doesn't fail as popular entertainment too. The actors make seemingly humanly-impossible acts look effortless!!!

Andrew's 3D Blu-ray Review: James Cameron and Andrew Adamson join forces to present a fantastical love story, featuring the best of the world-famous circus troupe's elaborate performances. The world's most famous acrobatic troupe delivers a feast of surreal beauty and moments of breath-catching wonder in the skilfully staged 3D film Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away.'

A greatest-hits extravaganza tenuously linked by a love-story narrative and the 3D film relies on directors Andrew Adamson and James Cameron's use of slow-motion, close-ups and inventive camera angles to smooth the transition from big top to big screen presentation on this spectacular 3D Blu-ray disc.

The undeniably spectacular skills of the Cirque du Soleil performers lose little in translation, although the intimate moments work decidedly better, as cinema-goers catch each slap of the aerialists' mid-air hand grasps and every droplet of water splashed. The elastic female gymnast doing solo backflips inside an oversized brandy glass was a totally boring pointless viewing experience in my personal opinion and should have been taken out of the whole show.

With more than 100 million tickets sold across six continents for Cirque du Soleil stage shows, the brand is certainly a spectacular experience for all ages. The new medium of this 3D Blu-ray disc opens up the experience to an even wider audience, in exploring this awesome experimental artistic stunning film, to savour time after time with this beautiful 3D Blu-ray disc.

The story opens with something that would never happen at a live Cirque du Soleil performance, a fall from The Aerialist [Igor Zaripov]. Mia [Erica Linz], a petite outsider visiting a down-at-heel old-timey circus, the kind with sword-swallowers and bearded ladies, is drawn to one of the performers. He's a trapeze artist simply known as The Aerialist [Igor Zaripov] and when she catches his eye mid-air, he breaks concentration and plunges to the ground.

The sand of the rink gives way and she follows him down the rabbit hole, as it were, into a parallel universe where she meets that madly prancing clown [John Clarke]. He escorts her through a series of fantastical realms populated by trampolining superheroes, rider less tricycles and giant double-jointed spiders from the company's Las Vegas shows, including O, Mystre, Believe and Viva.

As Mia [Erica Linz] wanders through these dreamscapes clutching a poster of The Aerialist [Igor Zaripov] to her chest, Mia [Erica Linz] alternates eye-widening with theatrical brow-furrowing. Let's just say that as an actress, she's a good acrobat, which is made clear in the gorgeously romantic finale. The brow-furrowing is understandable, though, as, like most abstractedly mystical Cirque du Soleil stage shows, the action follows the logic of a dream.

Still, the unifying accomplishment is in the giddy acrobatics, sleek sensuality and heart-stopping derring-do of the performers, as well as the constantly sumptuous, transporting immersive cinematography, and the final result is some of the coolest cinema performance footage ever recorded in 3D. Some acts are physically astounding and technically well staged; especially the aerial pas de deux finale is especially very good and spectacular.

Most Cirque du Soleil shows do have a story line, usually a young person on a quest, and ""Worlds Away"" does that extremely well. Acted without dialogue, the plot concerns a gamine acrobat [Erica Linz] who attends a shabby, real-world carnival and is so entranced by a handsome The Aerialist [Igor Zaripov] that she's compelled to follow him, Alice-like, down a hole and into another universe. There, a bordering-on-creepy clown escorts her through show-stopping numbers from Cirque du Soleil's Vegas shows. The opening set from ""O"" features swimmers, acrobats, and contortionists in, on, and above water. A segment from ""K"" boasts Imperial China-influenced visuals, costumes, and makeup with acrobats performing gravity-defying stunts on a near-vertical platform. Less eye-popping is the ""Whole Lotta Shakin'"" number from the now-closed ""Viva Elvis."" A segment from ""Love"" features The Beatles ""Octopus's Garden"" with troupe members suspended like chandeliers and dripping in white tendrils like floating jellyfish. ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" boasts a Sgt. Pepper-like master of ceremonies presiding over an assortment of Fellini-esque characters.

Cirque du Soleil live performance in this 3D Blu-ray, are considered the epitome of the ultimate ""contemporary circus;"" the show draws inspiration from circus styles around the world, usually weaving a very loosely-structured storyline in the process. In other words: the narrative for Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away' is mostly meant as an excuse to stage a variety of Cirque du Soleil set pieces and routines, which were captured using James Cameron's PACE Fusion 3D camera system and wow does it work for me, spectacularly.

That said, James Cameron's PACE Fusion 3D system is great for expansive and immersive visuals, which Worlds Away should offer in loads. Similarly, it's impossible to not admire the athleticism of Cirque du Soleil performers and marvel at how often they're but a single misstep away from greatly injuring themselves; obviously, you won't have to worry about that happening in this 3D Blu-ray. Anyone who's ever wanted to see a Cirque du Soleil live stage performance, but never been able to for whatever reason, that it is too expensive, no nearby location: this is the way to go.

It's not much of a spoiler to reveal that Mia and The Aerialist eventually are reunited, and we finally get the chance to see them become active participants, thanks to a beautiful stunning airborne aerobic acrobatic performance. Fireworks signify the explosion of romance in the air, and the film then comes to an abrupt conclusion. The cast even takes bows, over end credits set to The Beatles ""All You Need is Love.""

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  This is a combination Andrew Adamson and James Cameron production, so, as to be expected by now, Worlds Away was an original high definition 3D production shot with the PACE Fusion 3D system. It comes to this 3D Blu-ray with a stunning 1080p encoded image and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 which is totally awesome. Like most productions from AVATAR' to the more recent Life of Pi' which again is shot with the PACE Fusion 3D system, and gives the 3D a totally natural and gorgeous vision. In the very opening scene, there is a bit of a pop-up book look, and, on my display, some issues with crosstalk. However, once we move to the Circus Maximus and beyond, these issues dissolve and we are given a strong 3D effect with great depth. In 2D, the image is strong as well, offering a lot of detail and texture with no anomalies to speak of.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away' features a dazzling 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround soundtrack. It's smooth but also aggressive, making extensive and natural use of the surround channels in every scene. Musical delivery is precise, showing great clarity and seamless flow around the stage. The track makes use of a positive, balanced low end, whether a rumbling train, which displays great sound imaging that moves from one side to the other or in support to the music. The film is littered with all sorts of distinct, well-placed, and demonstration-worthy moments that bring the world to life and are guaranteed to put even the best sound system through its paces. This is a marvellous listening experience that alone is worth the price of the 3D Blu-ray disc.

3D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Making Worlds Away [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [2:26] Here we get an in-depth look at the amazing fantasy presentation of Cirque du Soleil and we get an interesting perspective from the likes of James Cameron [Executive Producer]; Andrew Adamson [Producer/Writer/Director]; Erica Linz [Mia] and Martin Bolduc [Producer]. Despite it not being a very long special feature, it is still an interesting look at what makes Cirque du Soleil so magical and spectacular.

Special Feature: A Day in the Life with Erica Linz [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [13:24] Here we get another intimate look behind-the-scene on how the artists go about training for the acrobats and visual presentation of Cirque du Soleil and of course the main presenter is the main female character in the show, which of course is Erica Linz. We also get introduced to the other acrobatic performers, who are Pierre-Luc Sylvain; Kyle DesChamps and Cheetah Platt. We also get to see behind-the-scene on how the filming was produced for the show, with contributions from Andrew Adamson and James Cameron.

Trailer: Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas Commercial [2012] [1080p] [16:9] [1:01] This is a very spectacular commercial, showing off what makes Cirque du Soleil so special, magical and awesome, that takes you into a fantasy world we would all love to be in.

Finally, `Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away' has a soul, a very human soul that surpasses in spirit and accomplishment even the cutting-edge technology used to bring it the screen. For all the marvels behind the scenes, Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away' truly dazzles through the skill of its performers. It's an amazing spectacle of human agility that's been seen before but perhaps not quite at this level of perfect execution. It makes for a nice escape from the phoniness of Hollywood even as the world of Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away' is itself incredibly stylized and offers a glimpse into something uniquely human and very much real, even under makeup, costumes, and through the prism of the latest in technology. Paramount's Blu-ray 3D release of Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away' delivers excellent and stunning video images and equally awesome audio surround sound. Supplements are few, but despite this, this 3D Blu-ray release nevertheless comes with a top rating. Highly Recommended!

5427378,5,B00AIBZJS4,"If you are at all familiar with Cirque shows, then you may have seen some of this video.  They have done a masterful job in creating a story that brings many Cirque shows into one storyline.  A young lady goes to a carnival and begins to eye up the acrobat.  He catches her looking at him while performing and falls.  As he falls, the ground gives way like quicksand.  She jumps out of her seat under the big top and tries to rescue him, only to be pulled into the sand as well.  The adventure begins from here to find the acrobat.  A little bit of ""Love,"" ""O,"" ""Mystere,"" and many more.  My seven year old daughter watches it over and over again and I get pulled into it every time I walk by and she has it on.",1429488000,,711,4.0647482014388485

5427417,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Beyond mind blowing !  I thought Alegria was the only Cirque du Soleil worth watching till I saw this by accident on the Amazon movie channel.  I was amazed at every aspect of this production from the incredible stage settings and lighting to the stellar performances of those incredible athletes.  I was even more amazed to find out that this production incorporated aspects of several other Cirque shows I did not even care for.  How did they take shows I did not care for and blend them into (to me anyway) a coherent love story that journeys through the bizarro worlds or Cirque du Soleil?  This has to be the culmination of Cirque's experience with this type of programing.  Every aspect of anything they have ever touched was blended in magnificently and smoothly and even more incredible than ever before.  It was 3d ballet from the water to the air.  In my opinion this is the best Cirque show EVER !  And a must have for that private video collection.  My synopsis of this show is of a pretty little girl that falls in love with a handsome young aerial performer that is stolen away by the forces of darkness and evil in an accident that draws and separates them both into the ""Alice in Wonderland"" bizarro worlds of Cirque du Soleil. Aspects of light and good help the girl and guide her in her search.  It is touch and go for the young couple as darkness and  evil fights to keep them apart, but the forces of light and good win out in the end and they finally join together in an awesome 3d love ballet.",1428796800,,1515,4.4296028880866425

5427522,3,B00AIBZJS4,"I believe that I saw this performance while at Disney a year or so ago while primarily at the Daytona 500.  Rather than a movie, as suggested by Time, it was more of an extract of many of the highlights.  The performance had continuity and a magical flow from one part to the next.  This ""movie"" was more of the ""today's"" shock-and-awe visual slamming of discontinuity.  So, did I watch the show from start to finish?  ""Yes!""  The performers exhibit a skill set that is almost a visual fantasy in its execution.  Would I recommend this show?  Having been to the performance in person, and having watched this show, I would say it is not worth seeing a second time.  If you have not seen the performance in person, then by all means watch it, you will probably enjoy it once you begin to make sense of the story line.  Why the three (3) stars?  I saw the performance in person.  This show lacks continuity in comparison AND even more so, several of the acts that were not in the move that would have been better than some of the material that was shown in lieu!

I just bought a Samsung F8500 60"" plasma TV (my first 3D TV) with BD-F5900 DVD player connected to my AV Receiver and wanted to try out the TV's 3D feature.  Both my wife and I had seen Cirque du Soleil performances live and I thought this DVD would be a good way to test my new setup.  The movie itself seemed to start off a little slow initially but it just continued to build scene-wise/action-wise and only get better as the show progressed.  The 3D effect was quite stunning, especially in many of the more close-up scenes (using Samsung supplied SSG-5150GB 3D glasses).  The DTS HD sound fed to my 5.1 receiver seemed very crisp with a lot of impact with good base through my subwoofer when appropriate.  We were truly entertained as we felt we were sitting right there in the audience for 1-1/2 hr!

5428281,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This was the most surprising movie I've seen in a very long time. I have always loved Cirque Du Soleil, since seeing Mystre live in Las Vegas in the late 90's.
But the pairing of this live show with the magic of Hollywood, left me completely enthralled.
I enjoyed seeing many incredible acts paired with an actual movie type storyline.
It would be even better to make a 2hr movie next time, so we can see a little more of each act and even the singer, whom you can see in Cirque live shows.
'O' was my favorite with the water and I think using it in movie form enhanced the visual idea of the live show. We are taken from an audience and like the trapeze artists we have an aerial perspective that you can't get from the live show. And the girl (who the show is centered around)  unlike on stage u Only see her and her story at times, just like a movie and not a live show.
I found this Very entertaining!
It draws you in and you just want to see more and more.",1410393600,,961,4.084656084656085

(Spoiler alert:) I gave the movie a 3 star only, because it's the typical boy meet girl, boy falls in love with girl, and blah blah blah...regardless, it's a great love story and movie. But too generic and not unique for me, I ended up getting bored at the end of the movie and went to do laundry.

Wanted to see more, but the attempts at a story line just dragged on and on. Initial setup was too long. The ""dream/nightmare sequences"" between acts were abstract, scattered, and way too long. I lost interest and didn't enjoy the last half of the show, because the interludes between each act got stranger and longer. The Beatles music accompanying the last few acts was great, but it was too little too late.",1405900800,,518,4.9655172413793105

5428658,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Having missed a few opportunities to view one or another Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas, I leaped at the chance to see this show on Amazon Prime streaming video (or whatever this service is officially called).

The underlying story line (girl meets boy, loses boy, searches for boy, etc.) is as thin and trite as can be, but the action is totally engrossing. Furthermore, the outstanding cinematography and editing offer a view that may be better than what is available in person in a front-row seat of a live performance. This movie is a convenient and inexpensive (free via Amazon Prime!) way to watch Cirque Du Soleil take acrobatics to a whole new level and create a distinctive, gorgeous and compelling art form.",1405123200,,721,4.768

5428875,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This film is a compilation of several productions of the Cirque Du Soleil tied together by a simple story.  Great, athletic, and beautifully staged.",1403222400,,148,5.166666666666667
5428876,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have seen all but one of their shows in Las Vegas! This movie uses parts of the many shows tied together into a movie. You should understand that the scenes come from several different theatres in Vegas.,1403136000,,205,4.421052631578948
5428877,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This was a fantastic performance & interesting plot, a twist of delight.  I loved the surreal ending.  Just beautiful for anyone who has ever seen Cirque du Soleil, and is a must for those who haven't and really need to go see a live performance.  The two lead actors and performers were OUTSTANDING.",1403136000,,300,4.622641509433962

5428879,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I have always wanted to see the Crique Du Soleil but it too expensive to go to a live show. This was probably better than being there, you got to see from all angles, down from the top, under the water, up from the bottom. I was truly impressed and will watch it again.",1403049600,,269,4.0
5428880,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Awe-inspiring trapeze performance.  Very entertaining, but loses a lot when seen on TV compared to watching them in a live performance.",1403049600,,135,5.428571428571429
5428881,4,B00AIBZJS4,"As with many Cirque productions the story is a little hard to follow. The stunning and amazing acrobatics easily make up for it. This is a must see if you are a current Cirque Du Soleil fan, or are curious about what they do.",1403049600,,225,4.136363636363637
5428882,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Cirque Du Soleil never fail to impress. From the design of the set to the artistry of the clothes designers to all of the different performers it leaves me in awe. This movie tells a story but there are no words. If you are fascinated by seeing people push themselves to the human limit and watching something as crazy as the dreams you might have when you close your eyes, then this movie is for you.",1403049600,,401,4.2894736842105265
5428883,4,B00AIBZJS4,It was a good fantasy acrobatic film. Better for younger people. I liked it though. Good for a weeknight. Watch it,1403049600,,114,4.476190476190476
5428904,4,B00AIBZJS4,Recently saw this on an overseas flight on a very small poor quality back of seat screen. While a little confusing at times the finale of the 2 arialists was one of the most beautiful and sensual I have ever seen.  Rewound and watched that part 4 times.,1403049600,,253,4.270833333333333
5428905,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Didn't get the chance to catch this in the theaters, but glad I found it here on Amazon. It was not until the end when the credits ran that it became clear that this was a series of shows at different venues combined to make a single story. Very clever!",1402963200,,253,4.08
5428906,5,B00AIBZJS4,I wish my body could bend like that.  Acually would be worth watching again.  Music was great and well timed to the performance,1402963200,,127,4.478260869565218

5428908,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Very lovely, entertaining, and amazing that they can do what they do.  I have always wanted to see their work, but live in a small town in Alabama, so their shows are not convenient.",1402963200,,182,4.352941176470588
5428909,2,B00AIBZJS4,"Like a weird 'New Age' circus performance. There appears to be an attempt at including some sort of plot, maybe, really it's just like a weird circus show without having to go to an actual circus. To be fair, the circus performance is excellent, just not what I was looking for in a 'movie'.",1402790400,,291,4.407407407407407
5428910,4,B00AIBZJS4,I wouldn't expect anything less than this from Cirque Du Soleil. Their presentations are always so meticulous and interesting to say the least. Watched it twice.,1402790400,,161,5.230769230769231

5428940,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I love Cirque Du Soleil, I have seen them live in Vegas.  This is the first one I saw digitally. I have to admit the director captured the keys elements the of the live show, however the recorded version,  as with  any show that is meant to be see live, fails to capture the excitement of  the unknown.",1402185600,,302,4.155172413793103
5428941,3,B00AIBZJS4,Wonderful designs and costuming.  Great acrobatics.  Good story but the story line is a little muddled.  It is kind of long.,1402012800,,124,4.809523809523809
5428942,5,B00AIBZJS4,Some of these performances are hard to believe they are physically possible.  We thoroughly enjoyed the entire show.  The time went by fast.,1402012800,,140,5.043478260869565

5428954,3,B00AIBZJS4,"CDS is one of my favorite shows - done live. I have seen Mystere four times, and would see it again.  The film is OK, but does not capture the magic of being there.",1402012800,,164,3.823529411764706

5428956,5,B00AIBZJS4,"All previous versions that I've watched were basically taped productions of live performances.  This one attempted to to seam in the storyline with production values - I much prefer the beauty of the raw performance.  Never the less, this was entertaining and probably a great view for the biggest fans and first time watchers.",1402012800,,327,5.037037037037037
5428957,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Very intriguing. The individual performances were amazing and the talent was astounding! I would love to give 5 stars but the wardrobe was, for me, disturbing.

5428962,2,B00AIBZJS4,I expected a show like I see today......not yesterday.  I've seen the shows of today and they are exceptional....and that is hat I expected.,1401840000,,140,4.833333333333333
5428963,5,B00AIBZJS4,This was a great show.  I have always wanted to attend a live performance and have never been able to.  My husband even watched it with me.  Now we are going to make time to attend a live event since we liked it so much.  Great performers!,1401753600,,239,4.0212765957446805

5428977,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I liked this movie treatment of the things that cirque made famous. It is beautiful and long. I found myself drifting off which was never a part of a real cirque performance.  On the other side, I enjoyed repeating some scenes that were so complex that you needed two looks to see most of it. Is this worth watching?  Absolutely!  But if you get a chance to see it live, take it.",1401580800,,379,4.236111111111111
5428978,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Very imaginative script, choreography, and production.  You feel like you are being transported into the mind of a person on a hallucinogenic trip -- probably why the soundtrack contains a lot of tunes from ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.""  The acrobatics were also jaw-dropping at times.  You need to be in the mood to ""take a trip"" into this world for over an hour, or you'll be overwhelmed and feel the need to take a break.",1401580800,,435,4.623376623376624

5428980,1,B00AIBZJS4,"This really didn't do justice to the stage shows. I love some of Cirque's shows and am lukewarm on others, like Ka. Unfortunately this was a lot Ka, which is mainly interesting for the stage... not what I want to see at a Cirque show.

The video has moments but overall falls short of conveying what it's like to be at a good cirque show. There's a lot lost in translation.

And there's no story. Just random scenes out of various Cirque Vegas shows and two characters who keep appearing and disappearing for no reason. I had really hoped for more of a story to take advantage of film as a medium. Not just a videotape of the stage production. But, no, it's just a video of the theater performance, which loses most of the energy you get from a live performance. Personally, I found the whole thing pretty boring... despite the fact I love this type of theater in person.",1401494400,,871,4.403726708074534
5428981,5,B00AIBZJS4,"this movie's storyline was a little sci=fi but the colors, the choreography, the strength, agility, timing, during these perfiormances was beautiful. the viewer is pulled into the breathtaking scenes.

5429006,2,B00AIBZJS4,"This is a story told through a variety of media - trapeze, dance, synchronized swimming - and that is just at the beginning.  If you are into that, you might enjoy.

5429013,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This film shows a series of Cirque performances.  There are no special effects other than just the acts themselves.

My only reservation is the very loose narrative. It's not particularly compelling. Aside from that, ""Worlds Away"" is full of wonderment.",1399680000,,275,5.9
5429112,5,B00AIBZJS4,Movie gives you a window into several of the Cirque shows now running in Las Vegas. It does it with a clever story. The movie is fun and I would recommend it to all Cirqe lovers and to anyone who is curious about what Cirque is all about.,1399593600,,238,3.9791666666666665
5429113,2,B00AIBZJS4,The story line was too obscure.  Started watching but turned it off.  I love the acrobatics of Cirque DuSoleil but a live performance trumps video any day!,1399507200,,155,4.703703703703703
5429134,5,B00AIBZJS4,This was fun to watch!  And as a designer and artist it certainly wets the creative brain cells every time I watch it.,1399420800,,118,4.130434782608695
5429135,5,B00AIBZJS4,This was the most beautiful visual experience that I have seen on tv. I will definitely suggest this to others.,1399420800,,111,4.6

5429139,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I am a long-time fan of Cirque du Soleil (I went to see it often when it came to Chicago) and was happy to get in for my Kindle Fire HD.  After watching it I've decided to buy it on a Blu-ray disc -- I feel that seeing it on a 30""-40"" screen will be better than on a 7"" screen.
For those familiar with the usual CdS performances, this is similar, except that it has a very sketchy sort-of plot.  Very highly recommended.",1399420800,,420,3.988095238095238

5429141,5,B00AIBZJS4,"We loved it.  Just saw ""Totem"" in person in Portland, Oregon and a friend had told me on Facebook that Netflix or Amazon had Cirque Do Soleil movies, which I never knew.  I was happy to hear that and my husband and I sat down and watched this one.  We really enjoyed it.  Not the same as being there but this way we get to see more of them.  They're so fantastic.",1399334400,,363,3.986111111111111

5429143,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I enjoyed watching the circus acts, but kept waiting for something to happen in the story line -- which is about a young girl wandering through a circus world guided by a clown (or clowns). But nothing comes of it. Disappointed.",1399248000,,228,4.585365853658536
5429164,5,B00AIBZJS4,"The story line is thin, but the cirque crew is visually stunning (as always).  Our kids loved this and actually ask to watch it over and over again.",1399248000,,148,4.285714285714286
5429165,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Perhaps the most fantastic trip one can take without indulging in alcohol or recreational drugs! A thoroughly electric performance, tickling all the neurons of imagination. There is a plot, and its resolution brings a final satisfaction, even though its expression is rather subtle  throughout much of the movie.

5429168,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I absolutely luv'd how this storyline pulls us right in from the very beginning and all the lines and colors that are used in this portrayal of a search for love. Of course, all the performances just add to the film, since it reminds me so much of a ""picture book."" ;) Definitely great for all ages!",1398988800,,299,4.2631578947368425

5429171,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I enjoyed watching this video so much.  The physicality of the performers, their flexibility and grace is astounding.  They make it look so easy and effortless.

5429173,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Excellent movie combining the Cirque Du Soleil shows into a great movie plot!  It's amazing how limber the human body can become as they do some incredible contortions.  The scene changes are also fascinating.  A movie the whole family can watch, which is amazing in itself!",1398988800,,274,4.913043478260869
5429174,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I love watching Cirque Du Soleil -- the talent is always amazing and the compilation of the multiple programs in this story line was exceptional.  Now it makes we want to go back to Vegas to see the shows I missed:  The Beatles, Elvis ..... you will see watch and enjoy!!!

5429176,3,B00AIBZJS4,"If i were to see this in person, i am sure that it would have been amazing.  But to watch a play set on a stage in movie form...it was just a little odd.  But this comment is not to take away from the fantastic performers and story line.  Next time, i will just see it in person :)",1398902400,,281,3.7288135593220337

5429178,5,B00AIBZJS4,absolutely amazing. the entire family loved it !! Would Love to own it :) My favorite part was the trampoline acrobats !,1398816000,,120,4.5
5429179,5,B00AIBZJS4,From start to finish this film held my attention. There is no dialogue - just a musical theme that follows a young girl as she searches for her lost love - an aerialist. The film is a series of circus acts that were filmed at various casinos where cirque du solieil performed. Great visual effects. Captivating,1398816000,,310,4.553571428571429
5429180,4,B00AIBZJS4,"A mixture of some of the shows.
 O and Love, the two that I know were well represented.
Typical Cirque. Enjoyable.",1398729600,,114,4.428571428571429

5429224,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I can't honestly rate this yet, I've only watched part of it so far. What I have seen so far is very entertaining.",1398643200,,114,4.0
5429225,5,B00AIBZJS4,"... CdS show I've ever seen on the screen. The soundtrack wasn't their best, but I'd say the video production was.",1398643200,,114,4.476190476190476
5429226,5,B00AIBZJS4,My husband and I really enjoyed this program.  The production was magnificent and the performers were absolutely amazing!  It was time well spent!,1398643200,,146,5.304347826086956
5429227,5,B00AIBZJS4,Found it so enjoyable. Was surprised that it is a journey through all active shows in Vegas. Loved the idea how the story was tied into it. Highly recommend this for fans of Cirque Du Soleil as well as those who have always been curious. Many of the shows displayed are not available on video and it is an opportunity for those who have never seen Cirque Du Soleil live to get an idea about what is going on in these shows.,1398556800,,423,4.170731707317073
5429228,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Absolutely beautiful. An enchanting look into the world of Cirque Du Soleil.  No regrets here.  Loved it so much, was thinking of buying.  Totally worth the time investment. Enjoy!",1398556800,,180,5.137931034482759
5429229,5,B00AIBZJS4,Truly a show that must be seen.one that is truly for the whole family. A variety that will entertain all ages young and old alike.,1398556800,,130,4.24

5429231,2,B00AIBZJS4,"The sets were beautiful, the filming was precise, but the show was disappointing and we stopped mid-way through. In the first place, the acts showed a violent bent -- a chained man, and fighting on a vertical surface.  In the second place, the acts went on and on and on -- it got boring. Why waste one's time?",1398470400,,310,4.344827586206897
5429232,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Have always heard good things about this franchise. Was not disappointed!  Athletic ballet...aerial acrobatics were superlative, and the symbolism and artistry drew you in for more. Highly recommended.",1398470400,,201,6.178571428571429
5429233,5,B00AIBZJS4,"If you are a fan of the Cirque du Soleil production, this is definitely a must see. You will see acts from Mystere, Ka, Zumanity, Viva Elvis, O, Believe and Love all combine into a love story between Mia and the Aerialist resulting into a grand finale which you will need to watch the film to find out.",1398384000,,302,4.224137931034483
5429244,5,B00AIBZJS4,It was given as a gift and have not seen it yet but the family that got it loved the video.,1398384000,,91,3.380952380952381
5429245,4,B00AIBZJS4,"If you enjoy Cirque Du Soleil, then you don't need a review - it is entertaining.  It seems to be parts from various shows they have -  it looks like it and that's what the credits at the end indicate.  So it isn't an original show.  As typical of their shows their is a very vague plot where a young lady is searching for someone and goes through parts of different Cirque shows.  I enjoyed it, and would likely watch it again, but I also liked that it was a video so I could stop and take a break or speed forward through some parts.  The performances are incredible, but sometimes a little bit of a performance is enough...  Thinking back about it - it's more like a 'highlights of Cirque Du Soleil', and not a new show which was what I was expecting.",1398384000,,754,4.194444444444445
5429246,5,B00AIBZJS4,Have seen 14 different Cirque Shows live. This gives a nice look at some of the Las Vegas permanent shows!,1398384000,,106,4.35
5429247,5,B00AIBZJS4,We were VERY happy with this dvd.  Am looking forward to adding more of these to our collection!  We HIGHLY recommend.,1398384000,,118,4.571428571428571
5429248,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Lovely movie, but not a movie in the traditional sense. The storytelling is kkkkiiiinnnda sequitur. Watch for the pretty and amazement, not the story and you will like this movie just fine.",1398297600,,189,4.9375
5429249,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I really enjoyed this movie, my wife not so much! It was very entertaining and i would recommend it to anyone...",1398211200,,112,4.380952380952381
5429250,5,B00AIBZJS4,Of course anything with a great love story in it is a 5 star rating from me. I was very impressed with the show. All of the characters played their part perfectly. The art was an overdose for the senses. The whole thing was a masterpiece.,1398211200,,238,4.195652173913044
5429251,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I was not disappointed by the skill of the performers or their talents, there is a shallow story line, this is not so much a movie as a show case for very talented acrobats and high wire performers. I thought it was going to be like a movie with acrobatics, but it was not a movie. Just cool stunts and awesome talent on display.",1398211200,,329,4.15625
5429252,1,B00AIBZJS4,Looked like it had been filmed in the theatre with someone's iphone.  I have no idea if the storyline would have been any good as we shut it off after 10 minutes.  I'm really surpirsed this film would be cleared for public viewing with such horrible filming.,1398211200,,258,4.468085106382978
5429253,5,B00AIBZJS4,"i had no idea.  i checked it out because i had seen some of their shorter things.  i wasn't expecting to be taken worlds away.  it was late at night and i was tired of sitcoms, hero stories, love stories ""drama"" all in lower case.  i had no idea.  it was a wonderful experience.  watch it",1398124800,,288,4.053571428571429
5429274,5,B00AIBZJS4,Made me want to see the live performance. I've heard they put on a great performance. It was definitely entertaining.,1398124800,,117,4.9
5429275,4,B00AIBZJS4,Worlds Away was performed well. I enjoy the physicality of the Cirque du Soleil acrobats. That word seems too small for the great performances and extreme tests that they put their bodies through. The movies don't have any words as their stories depict multi-cultural themes. I am occasionally in the mood for this genre.,1398038400,,321,4.962962962962963
5429276,4,B00AIBZJS4,"So very Cirque Du Soleil!  I was dubious at first that the magic could be created via a streaming medium but, although it is much more enveloping to see them live, the production was mood altering enough for me to highly recommend watching.  (I should add that, for me, to experience them live has been practically a life changing experience.)",1398038400,,343,4.7
5429277,3,B00AIBZJS4,Cloning story line is interesting. Choppy episode's intro and ending sometimes confusing or disorganized. Fast forward button is necessary. Ok,1398038400,,142,6.15
5429278,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This is an amazing show, a little strange, but dazzling and fantastic at the same time. I would encourage ""children"" of all ages everyone to watch.",1398038400,,147,4.6923076923076925
5429279,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I'm really amazed by the incredible talent the member of Cirque Du Soleil have. This particular movie have very impressive visuals. I also loved the choreography, the costumes and makeup and the whole story line.",1397952000,,212,5.085714285714285
5429280,5,B00AIBZJS4,Just like going to a show. You will be hooked. Once I saw a show in person I became a huge Cirque fan.,1397952000,,102,3.4782608695652173
5429281,2,B00AIBZJS4,I have been to many different performances of Cirque du Soleil because my wife is a fan and I found this to NOT be one of their best acts,1397952000,,137,3.7586206896551726
5429282,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I purchased this on my Kindle Fire because in the preview, it appeared as though the scenery would be breathtaking.  However, most of the scenery wasn't so breathtaking, and this movie just wasn't for me. I found it to be mostly boring because it moved very slowly, especially the plot line wherein the girl was looking for the man on the high wire.  There were subtitles so that the few words spoken could be understood, but the whole production seemed without much substance to me.

 All-in-all, I was very disappointed as I'd heard wonderful things about the Cirque Du Soleil for so many years, and I had a lot of excitement in being able to purchase the movie.  Maybe the acts lend themselves more to live performances than being viewed on a small screen.  Giving 2 stars for the costumes.",1397865600,,793,4.628571428571429
5429313,5,B00AIBZJS4,I showed it in my class and the students loved it thank youI hope to share some walk creative movies & culture,1397865600,,110,4.045454545454546
5429314,1,B00AIBZJS4,"If this is what Cirque Du Soleil is all about, I am sooooooo glad I watched it for free.  It was the saddest assemblage of junk I have ever seen.  Kindergarten plays are better.  I shutter to think that at Disney World you would have had to give up two dinner credits to see a Cirque Du Soliel, I would not have given one snack credit for anything this bad.  For heaven's sake don't pay for this bomb!",1397865600,,401,4.102564102564102
5429315,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This was the same one my husband said he saw in Vegas.
I have no idea how these people do it but it was thrilling to watch.",1397865600,,123,3.5925925925925926
5429316,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I really enjoyed the way that the film melded the various shows the Cirque has produced to make the story flow . The story that they tell and the sheer amount of skill required to successfully pull off the stunts, acrobatics and all of the other dance feats in this show just kept me on the edge of my seat and waiting for more. The music was amazing as well and the show seemed to flow with out any pressure or awkward transitions.",1397779200,,432,4.216867469879518
5429317,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Brings back memories for those who have seen their live performance - and serves to introduce this talented troupe to others who have not witnessed them in person.  Beautiful sights and sounds that capture well the excitement of ""being there"".",1397692800,,243,5.075
5429318,5,B00AIBZJS4,Beautiful and mesmerizing. The music is so relaxing. My granddaughter loves it too. We call it our sleepy time movie.,1397692800,,117,4.9
5429319,3,B00AIBZJS4,I like the moves of the dancers and the trapeze effects not much to the imagination and not a lot interest,1397692800,,106,4.095238095238095
5429320,5,B00AIBZJS4,"It was beautiful, truly entertaining. I really enjoyed seeing many different elements of the magical worlds of the wonderful shows.",1397606400,,131,5.6

5429384,1,B00AIBZJS4,"I only watched about the first 20 minutes of this, so maybe it got better later, but the beginning was just too dark--dark in the sense of light and dark and dark in the sense of gloomy. Just strange. I thought it would be Cirque Du Soleil acts (which are sometimes a little strange but are at least entertaining). Didn't enjoy it.",1397606400,2,331,4.354838709677419
5429385,4,B00AIBZJS4,Very entertaining.  I could watch acrobats and dancers all day.  I thought it was great.  I grew up listening to the Beatles!,1397606400,,125,4.590909090909091
5429386,5,B00AIBZJS4,Very impressive - as always watching Cirque Du Soleil never ceases to amaze me in both the physical ability and the devices they dream up to highlight the athleticism,1397520000,,166,4.758620689655173

5429389,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Surprisingly, my kids (2 and 4) are mesmerized by this movie and actually sit still to watch it. Very, very strange, but beautiful to watch. Cirque Du Soleil performers are, obviously, phenomenally talented.",1397347200,,207,5.303030303030303
5429390,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I've seen several Cirque Du Soleil performances in person. This movie had the same qualities and production ethics of their live performances.

I did have the feeling several times that I was not seeing new material. The scenes seemed somewhat familiar.

Nevertheless if you have never seen Cirque Du Soleil this movie is a good introduction. If you've seen them before and need a Cirque fix, this movie should do it.",1397260800,,417,4.859154929577465

5429393,3,B00AIBZJS4,There are too many character to follow that I got lost following the story line. It should be just a few character so its easy to follow.,1397174400,,137,4.111111111111111
5429394,5,B00AIBZJS4,This is an excellent compilation of performances which will make you ask: HOW DID THEY DO THAT???? This is a very good choice if you like Cirque Du Soleil.,1397088000,,155,4.379310344827586
5429395,3,B00AIBZJS4,The film was very colorful and the acrobats was tops but the movie was drawn out and made be sleepy,1397088000,,99,4.0
5429396,5,B00AIBZJS4,Even if you're not a big fan of Cirque Du Soleil odds are that you will enjoy this video. Combines several of their shows into one enjoyable presentation. My family loved it!,1397088000,,174,4.46875
5429397,5,B00AIBZJS4,My wife and I love Cirque du Soleil so this reminded us of all the  shows we've seen. The majority of the acts presented in this movie were from shows in Las Vegas so if you liked the acts in this movie... head on over to Vegas!,1397088000,,228,3.851063829787234
5429398,5,B00AIBZJS4,The story kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen as the lady was led on a journey to find the acrobat. And her search was not in vain.  The performance was spectacular.,1397001600,,188,4.081081081081081
5429399,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This was a fun and enjoyable movie for the family. I recommend it. If you can view 3D content, though, definitely go for the 3D version.",1396915200,,136,4.269230769230769
5429400,5,B00AIBZJS4,"True to Cirque form, this preformance is just wonderful. The music, (nice selection of Beatles songs)  the coriography, the spectacular costumes and the amazing athletes are incredible in this one. The water feature adds a new dimention and the acts of the moving circles, like hampster wheels are hard to believe.
The only con for me would be too much ""fighting"" which would have been ok but t lasted too long.
Otherwise, you just can't go wrong with a Cirque production.",1396915200,,472,4.827160493827161
5429401,2,B00AIBZJS4,This movie was very creative and the acrobatics were outstanding but the content of the movie was strange and I grew bored quickly.,1396915200,,131,4.739130434782608
5429402,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Are those real people performing? It is incredible as easy it seems to do aerial acrobatics (by them). But, in all fairness, I was already a fan of Cirque du Soleil. The thread was a nice surprise.",1396828800,,197,4.351351351351352

5429428,1,B00AIBZJS4,This definitely did not reach the level of their past shows. We have watched  2 performances and purchased their anniversary set of DVD's covering 10 years and they were fantastic. This one did not reach their normal level.,1396742400,,223,4.868421052631579

5429430,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This one is an outstanding show with high production values. It is a movie in its own right, not just a video of a performance like previous Cirque videos. It has an emotional arc that carries the viewer along and makes the performances part of a whole. Well done! Blu-ray makes a difference with this one.",1396656000,,306,4.482142857142857
5429431,3,B00AIBZJS4,Dancing and  scenery background was very good but story line was slow.  I became bored before it was over.  Thanks.,1396569600,,115,4.65

5429444,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Their is only one way to watch this show. With your eyes glued to the screen so that you don't miss a thing. And even then, re-watching it is the only way to be sure you got to see it all. The story plot is very romantic and every single performer is a true artist. I will never be able to see any of these shows live. I will never have the money for a plane ticket, hotel, tickets to the show, or food money. So, for me, this is a true blessing that they choose to put this out on dvd and blue ray! I am disabled and tonight was a really bad pain night for me. I came across this and hoped it would take my mind off of my pain. I didn't realize I was hurting by the time I was 20 min into it. It had me so absorbed that I was able to escape the pain for the entire show. That's unheard of for me. This show really is just that good! I can't believe the things that these people were doing. With the grace, and beauty that the entire show has, you just have to watch it at least once! God bless everybody!!! Melody",1396483200,,1014,3.8333333333333335

5429477,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Beautiful Aerial Dance Sequences

Amazing Fight Scenes and Stunts - I would expect no less from Cirque Du Soleil

5429561,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have been to Las Vegas and seen may Cirque Du Soleil productions.  The one I enjoyed most was KA because it balanced performance with a story.

Since I have a child in the family who is studying aerial dance, I am perhaps more intrigued than some and this may color my opinion. There is no dialogue, but the story is well told through dance, special effects, amazing costumes and scenery.  It has an Alice in Wonderland feel to it as the heroine wanders through a world of strangeness before finding her love, and the two of them perform a breathtaking pas de deux. Each move looks more impossible than the last!",1394668800,,517,4.619565217391305

The performers were nothing less than perfect in the execution to make this movie a keeper. And I certainly cannot leave out the excellent choreography, direction, and scenery. This movie is only slightly less than 5 stars!",1394323200,,389,4.63768115942029

You be impressed with most of the staging, it shows some of the best design and imagination you will find anyplace.  So if you can't afford to go to Las Vegas to see their shows in person, like most of us, buy or rent the movie in Blu-Ray HD.  If you can't watch in Blu-ray it may be ok but it is beautiful in Blu-ray.  I can hardly wait so see what the new 4K resolution will look like.",1393977600,,453,3.9450549450549453

5429689,5,B00AIBZJS4,This was my first encounter with Cirque Du Soleil.  It was phenomenal and I enjoyed all of it.  The creativity and artistry were unlike anything I'd seen before.  Their renditions of the Beatle's tunes were worlds away.  I'd like to hang out with the originators and creators.  The shenanigans they get into must be newsworthy.,1393891200,,327,4.872727272727273
5429690,3,B00AIBZJS4,"I've seen snippets of CIRQUE du SOLEIL over the years and expected more than an extended fairy tale presented in slow ballet form.  I fell asleep after the first half hour of waiting for something more to happen.  I'm ""culturally challenged"", not a big fan of ballet or the Circus, but usually Cirque du Soleil transcends regular Dance and Circus fare with impossible moves and actions.  Perhaps the moves of this piece were just too slow to keep my attention.  I kept waiting for this to turn into an action movie after the start and continually wondered what the young lady was able to do.  At one point there was a bit of action but it dissolved into nothingness when I fell asleep shortly after the young lady ""heroine"" was put into a big box and disappeared for awhile.

I remember four contortionists piled one atop the other, then unfolding like a flower; the aerialist in chains; the young lady in a box, and I nodded off.  Then I wrote this disappointed review.  I never saw the girl save the guy (if that's what happened); never saw their miraculous escape from the hole they fell into; or, an alternative ending with her joining the aerialist and his crowd in ""their world"".  I would not subject myself to returning for another hour of tortured boredom.

I gave this production three stars instead of two because it's Cirque Du Soleil.  It's a movie, NOT LIVE!  With all the wonderous special effects now available to regular actors and performers, allowing them to do the impossible in every frame, Cirque Du soleil fell far short of what I consider entertainment.  Is it that today's technology allows the ordinary to become extraordinary?  Or, did the producers of this script not use the performers of Cirque Du Soleil to the best of their ability to interact with technical special effects and really blow the viewers out of the water by taking this production to a level of ""impossible"" not yet achieved?

I expected enhanced impossible performances from the Cirque Du Soleil performers from the addition of special effects to their exceptional abilities.  A good plot or ""action theme"" could have further challenged the individual abilities of each one.  Persons like myself, ""light"" on cultural interests, need NEW and BETTER to be entertained.  No matter how exceptional a performance, if it doesn't constantly improve, it becomes predictable.  This is why competitions are so popular and why old records continue to fall to new ones.

This is a MOVIE and much more was possible.  I didn't see much here that could not have been achieved by the same performers in a live show.  Perhaps short-sighted producers only wanted to make Cirque Du Soleil available to a larger audience than those who can attend their live shows?  For me the movie was a big painfully boring let-down.  Persons who enoy ballet may feel otherwise.",1393804800,,2841,4.810309278350515

Wonderful costumes, amazing feats of daring & beauty.  Unfortunately, there was just TOO MUCH crammed into one film, & it about makes you dizzy to watch so much action, & at the same time try to figure out what the ""story"" is about, since there is no dialogue.  There is a weak story line, with a nice ending, but the film seemed too crammed with too much action, going from performance to performance so fast, it was hard to keep track of what was going on, & it was hard to discern what they were trying to get across; some seemed violent themes & maybe not suitable for younger viewers.  Mostly just  too much to take in all in one sitting.",1393372800,,820,4.3618421052631575

5429757,3,B00AIBZJS4,"three shows strung together by a thin story. Circus being the best, followed by Ka and The Beatles show, I forget the name. After 1hr I had no idea what was going on nor did I care. Aside from seeing the amazing things people could do in regards to the circus it was just theater that looks and plays out a lot better in a live viewing. The writing attempted to string these two characters who are battling to find each other in a maze of what I thought was a confused interpretation of the world as we know it. The lack of character definition failed so give me any sense of direction, or motivation to care about either of them.  They end up in places that don't fit in the story and just seem forced. Really bad job in connecting, however its still a good show for the first 45 min.",1393200000,,785,4.1644736842105265

5429761,2,B00AIBZJS4,"Really, my summary says all that I wanted to say about this so-called movie. It really is a montage of cirque shows from LV. Watching the live show you'll get to enjoy the live performance and music, here it's just seems like clips from the show itself barely tied together with the narrative. I was not impressed and watching this doesn't give the sense of joy and wonder that I felt with the actual show.",1393113600,,406,4.426666666666667

To me that means less pressure to get to Vegas to see any of these. I am amazed and astounded at what these athletes do and impressed with the whole stage craft of it but it just doesn't speak to me. Sometimes it even creeps me out a little for some reason. We are all different and I don't have to apologize for not being into it. But I appreciate it the hard work and skill I see on screen and I am glad I watched it. Just probably won't again for a long time.,1393113600,,611,3.935483870967742

5429816,4,B00AIBZJS4,Follow the story line and appreciate the talent. The effort that went into the production was well worth four stars.,1392768000,,116,4.85
5429817,3,B00AIBZJS4,Saw this the other night and with all Cirque shows it is visually astounding.  What I didn't like were the Beattle songs in the middle of the program.  It didn't fit and distracted immensely from the production.  That was enough to take this from four or five stars down to three.,1392768000,,280,4.450980392156863

5429819,5,B00AIBZJS4,"...of parts of old and newer shows on the strip right now.  I've seen five in person and on a 73"" TV screen, it was a great substitute.  My company enjoyed watching it.  Any more??  I'll have to check.",1392768000,,201,4.076923076923077
5429820,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Love this movie. Its a combination of Ka, O, Mystere, elvis, beatles put togrther. I saw Ka and O live and recognize the acts. In movie format, you don't get the granduer of scale in a live performance but you get to see the acts in under water, overall high up,or close up angles, thses you would never see no matter how good your seat in live.
This movie makes me want to take a trip out to LAS to see the others that i haven't seen.
Beautiful scenes,costume and amazing, unbelievable acts.",1392681600,,492,4.301075268817204
5429821,3,B00AIBZJS4,"But I became bored about halfway through and stopped watching. The story line wasn't compelling enough to hold my interest, and I could only watch just so much acrobatics:-(",1392681600,,173,5.0

5429845,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Very Artistic, but it just doesn't have the punch the live performances.  Still a good movie, not just one I want to watch again.",1392681600,,129,4.375
5429846,5,B00AIBZJS4,This movie combines aspects from several of the shows that Cirque preforms many I have only seen parts and previews of. the performers and costumes are outstanding,1392681600,,163,5.074074074074074
5429847,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This movie is a bit different from the usual Cirque Du Soleil fare.  I've seen a few shows previously, live and video, and this one seems to translate better than anything else I've seen.  For whatever reason, the story is easier to follow.  My seven year old daughter is enchanted by it and has watched it many times since.",1392681600,,324,4.4576271186440675

5429849,3,B00AIBZJS4,"An overall interesting show, but considering the tent elbow tight seating and more of gymnastic act vs. amazing show that i was under the impression they would perform, it was not worth the $100 per seat prices",1392681600,,210,4.702702702702703

5429851,5,B00AIBZJS4,I am only sorry that I did not see this in the Theater. The 3D DVD still brings out what a great Show this is.,1392595200,,110,3.44
5429852,5,B00AIBZJS4,Loved the amazing artist and the settings were wonderful!  I can't believe the artist could do all the thing that they were abel to do during the performance.  Wonderful Show!,1392595200,,175,4.8

5429865,5,B00AIBZJS4,"No other ""circus"" troupe in the world can captivate, mesmerize and awe like this one. Just when you think they have shown you something beyond your expectations, they go farther than the human imagination! Incredible;",1392595200,,217,5.228571428571429

5429867,5,B00AIBZJS4,I enjoyed the HD version while catching up on some sewing. I really like the convenience of using amazon prime to select and watch what I want when I choose.,1392595200,,157,4.266666666666667

5429870,1,B00AIBZJS4,"I thought this was the Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil which toured.  I had tickets to the show in Boston, but unfortunately, I got sick the day off the performance.  I missed it.  I went to Michael Jackson/Cirque Du Soleil website & thought this was the DVD of the performance. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. If there is a DVD showing the Michael Jackson performance by Cirque Du Soleil, I would be very much interested in buying it.  Please keep me posted!",1392508800,,470,4.559523809523809

5429873,5,B00AIBZJS4,"When I started watching this video, I didn't know ahead of time that they performed to Beatles music... what a delight! It was so magical and other worldly. They told a definite story, yet you could have watched any segment by itself and been totally entertained.

I love Cirque Du Soleil, and once again they don't disappoint. I am always amazed at their creativity and artistry. I was mesmerized, and totally caught up in the story, yet also in awe of the physical and artistic part of the performance. Can't recommend it highly enough!",1392422400,,538,4.723404255319149
5429874,5,B00AIBZJS4,Weird but the performances were awesome. Really liked ithe clowns and the main characters were gorgeous. But the movements of the show were incredible.,1392422400,,151,5.333333333333333
5429875,5,B00AIBZJS4,This movie is so rich and wonderful. I've watched it at least half a dozen times and cannot get enough.,1392422400,,103,4.2
5429876,4,B00AIBZJS4,"If you've never seen Cirque Du Soleil live, then you will really like this. Unfortunately, a video doesn't really capture the awesomeness Cirque Du Soleil live. Watching this only made me want to see a real CDS event. Nevertheless, the artistry of the show is beautiful to watch on video.",1392422400,,288,4.78
5429877,5,B00AIBZJS4,I am never disappointed with a Cirque du Soleil show. This one was just as enjoyable as going to the show. Even better was how I was able to look at the artistry close-up!,1392336000,,171,4.0588235294117645
5429878,5,B00AIBZJS4,"The movie showcases acts from several Cirque du Soleil shows. My favorite, live as in the movie, is the amazing O and the movie gives a rare chance to see it outside the Bellagio. I'm a big fan of the Cirque and the movie doesn't disappoint with a beautiful love story shown through the impressive and awe inspiring Cirque du Soleil acrobatics. Very well made.",1392336000,,360,4.553846153846154
5429879,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I am awed by how hard they work and their strength.  The choreography was fantastic.  I enjoyed the use and portrayal of the elements:  wind, rain, water, sand, hot, cold.
However, I was at times confused about the story line, will definitely watch again and again and again.",1392336000,,275,4.6875
5429880,5,B00AIBZJS4,"My son and I just finished watching this movie. All the acts were magical, especially the act where the guy is spinning the box on his hand, the colors in the box were absolutely Beautiful.

5429893,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have seen many Cirque Du Soleil performances in the theaters. Being able to see one at home without paying the big price for tickets is nice. You do not get the same sensation of suspending reality on the small screen as seeing it live. However it is still a treat.,1392249600,,267,4.254901960784314
5429894,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This is awesome. From start to finish you will be fully amazed by what they can do..It is almost impossible! I love the story plot, it is romantic and exciting.

5429901,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I don't know if these are actual people! The things they do are jaw droppingly incredible. There is now words to describe how amazing this movie is. The things they do are crazy, and I like how it shows a wide variety of things. My little girl loves to dance like the people. Great movie to watch!",1392076800,,297,4.228070175438597
5429902,1,B00AIBZJS4,"No story telling or any interesting part. It should call itself as an advertisement not the movie. It's all about advertisement of the show. If anyone like this show, you might like it.",1391990400,,185,4.636363636363637

5429914,3,B00AIBZJS4,"I never quite got it until the end.  The end, with the areal ballet was beautiful, but the rest of it, just sort of fizzled for me...although the colors, staging  and costuming was really good.",1391990400,,193,4.485714285714286
5429915,5,B00AIBZJS4,This is very good entertainment. I didn't know that you could get the human body to do these things. The music is very well done. Everything about this is great.,1391990400,,161,4.4
5429916,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I saw ""O"" live in Las Vegas and it was something I will always remember! This compilation of a lot of their performances was spectacular and makes me want to see more live performances.

5429918,3,B00AIBZJS4,I have always enjoyed cirque du soleil. There have been better. I will watch for more performances in the future.,1391990400,,113,4.7

5429920,5,B00AIBZJS4,My three year old granddaughter loved this and asked to see it multiple times.  I've seen their productions in person.  They are great.  Thank you for offering this as a Watch Now choice.  We appreciate it.,1391990400,,206,4.638888888888889
5429921,3,B00AIBZJS4,"The only way to appreciate what Cirque Du Soleil does is to see anyone of their current shows live.  This movie was fine if you never will have the opportunity to witness a show in person.  Being in the theater watching a live performance always has you searching the stage for the next occurrence even though what's unfolding before your eyes should be holding your attention.  The movie takes that joy away from you.  Again, not a knock on the movie but after seeing several Cirque shows in person a movie of their amazing performance/s just isn't quite the same.",1391904000,,565,4.62
5429922,5,B00AIBZJS4,"A magical journey through the circus, with amazing stunts and beautiful choreography.  Well worth watching again.  Now must see Cirque du Soleil live.",1391904000,,150,5.478260869565218

5429944,3,B00AIBZJS4,"The entire program shows the talents of all the acrobats but the actual story line was quite dull.  Now that I've watched it, I'm really not interested in seeing the real thing.",1391904000,,177,4.53125
5429945,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This was a great look at the amazing performances of Cirque du Soleil.  Having seen the touring company I knew that what I was seeing on the screen was an actual performance, not fixed for the screen.  The story line was okay, but not the reason I downloaded the film.",1391904000,,268,4.34
5429946,5,B00AIBZJS4,Very good for the young and old .enjoy the movie had a story to tell only the way  Cirque Du Soleil can do.,1391904000,,107,3.652173913043478
5429947,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I liked it. My spouse and kids were on the fence about it. My older daughter (15) liked it.
It is a story being told via circus performers not a movie",1391817600,,150,3.870967741935484
5429948,2,B00AIBZJS4,The acrobatics were good. The music was lame. Glad I did not buy this movie or go to the theater to see it.,1391817600,,107,3.6956521739130435

5429952,2,B00AIBZJS4,It was weird and the acrobatics weren't enough to hold my attention.i expected pure entertainment from a cirque du soleil show!,1391731200,,127,5.095238095238095
5429963,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This is an exquisite production.  For me there is a bit too much of the dark/surreal/nightmarish aspects -- I don't really see the point to the emphasis on craziness and violence -- It seems gratuitous and pointless.  But the skill, imagination and visual beauty made me gasp.  And the final 10 minutes between the aerialist and the girl is one of the most gorgeous, graceful, romantic and heavenly things I have ever seen.  It's worth it just to skip to that part (1:11:11).  Wow, I watched it over and over .  Thank you for this!!!",1391558400,,533,4.557894736842106
5429964,2,B00AIBZJS4,We only watched for a short time.  Talented people but rather boring as a film.  Not much of a story either.,1391558400,,108,4.095238095238095
5429965,5,B00AIBZJS4,I love watching Cirque live. So this wonderful movie highlighted some of they best stunts and music from the shows that are performed in Vegas.  If you want an introduction to the wonderful productions of Cirque watch this movie.,1391558400,,229,4.871794871794871
5429966,5,B00AIBZJS4,Worlds Away did just that took me worlds away. With all its vivid colors and musical splendor and eye popping wonder. Cirque in person never disappoints but I could not imagine how I could be impressed with the same talent on screen but they managed to pull it off. Kudos to the director and producer and of course all the wonderful talented performers.,1391558400,,353,4.619047619047619
5429967,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Amazing and beautifully executed - however the story (if you can call is a story) was disjointed and simply pieces from different shows re-imagined. Still, highly recommend. Am always in awe at what these men and women can do - just fantastic!",1391558400,,243,4.809523809523809
5429968,4,B00AIBZJS4,If you like Cirque Du SoLeiL you will enjoy this movie. It has highlights from various shows that are woven into the story. I am going to order a copy for my collection.,1391558400,,169,4.151515151515151
5429969,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This is what a dream feels like. It feels like magic, moves like rippled waves, and there is more emotion than storyline. Something about this enchanted me. I love the circus and the female protagonist expresses more with her eyes and expression than a whole Twilight film of dialog can. She is entranced by the aerialist and follows him through the rabbit hole, so to speak, where they are separated. Everything in this wonderland is very strange, few people are willing to help her, and there is danger lurking around every corner. He has been captured and tries to get away, but he does not even know she is there 

I loved the highlight of different performances and the music is fantastic (although, to be fair, they don't always transition well between the dreamlike melody to the Beatles, for example) and the performers are so expressive that I wonder why people struggled to understand what was going on. When you are watching Alice in Wonderland, do you wonder why the flowers are running amuck? or why the tea party is of any great interest? No, it is enchanting, engaging, and wonderful. Just sit back and enjoy, don't over think it - it is magic brought to life.",1391472000,,1175,4.671497584541063
5429970,1,B00AIBZJS4,"I have tried off and on for several months to watch this - with no success. This last time it did play for a couple of minutes - this is the first time it even fully loaded. In the past I got messages such as - no available at this time. Maybe it's my equiptment, but I am able to stream other movies and TV shows from Amazon, so........................",1391472000,,353,4.130434782608695

5429972,1,B00AIBZJS4,"I believe the only word that is said in the movie is ""help"".  The movie is actually the Cirque show held in Las Vegas.  The movie has a story line in  the beginning and then moves on to the Beatles revue.  The acrobatics are impressive but wouldn't both recommending it to anyone.",1391472000,,280,4.326923076923077
5429993,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Because I've watched most of these shows and I like them.  A good way to pass an hour or so without the gun play, vulgar language, or trash so prevalent now days.",1391472000,,162,4.0625
5429994,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Not good music and the characters were stogy.  It was  a very predictable story line.  I've seen the Cirque in person
two times before and don't think it transferred to the screen well.",1391472000,,185,4.545454545454546
5429995,5,B00AIBZJS4,"It was beautiful and magical.  I watched it on the computer screen, but it would have been better on a bigger screen.  Amazing acrobatics, performers, and costumes.",1391472000,,164,5.037037037037037
5429996,5,B00AIBZJS4,"i gave this five stars because it was a movie that had lots of art and showmanship without being risqu, which is a rare feat in today's ""do what you want"" world.",1391472000,,161,4.0625
5429997,2,B00AIBZJS4,"Its one of those movies that isn't really a movie.  I'm sure its full of culture and chaulked full of wisdom about the trials of life combined with cool costumes, daredevil stunts designed for circus atmospheres and tight leotards but I'm not able to to sit through 90 minutes of that.  ""Give me another pork chop Ethel and lets rent a NASCAR movie""",1391472000,,349,4.523809523809524
5429998,5,B00AIBZJS4,Great overview of many of the Cirque Du Soleil performances. It was wonderfully filmed and brought back memories of our last trip to Vegas!,1391472000,,139,4.833333333333333
5429999,5,B00AIBZJS4,I love this movie...I want to go to Vegas and see one of their shows. Soooo amazing and impressive! Mind blowing :),1391472000,,115,4.2727272727272725
5430000,5,B00AIBZJS4,It was amazing to watch this talented group of people and the creativity behind it..  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.,1391385600,,119,4.95
5430001,4,B00AIBZJS4,Off into the circus dream world.  This is a great trip through the many acts of the Cirque Du Soleil.  Each act is presented as part of the overall story.  Enjoyed it very much.,1391385600,,177,4.147058823529412
5430002,5,B00AIBZJS4,"A great view into 3 of the best Cirque shows, but not enough to spoile the shows for those wanting to see them in person",1391385600,,120,3.84
5430013,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I challenge you to watch this video and not be ""Wowed"" by the acrobatics.  That human beings can make their bodies do what these athletes do in this performance fascinates me.  That these artists can convey without dialog, merely by action and music, a story of such depth humbles me.",1391385600,,284,4.66
5430014,4,B00AIBZJS4,One of the better ones I have watched with the family.  Very wholesome and refreshing.  I have owned some of the previous videos,1391385600,,128,4.521739130434782
5430015,5,B00AIBZJS4,"The thing that glues me to the screen with Cirque Du Soleit is the artistry and story of the acrobatics. It's not just a bunch of fantastic acrobats, though I can watch them too. Cirque Du Soleit mesmerizes.",1391385600,,207,4.473684210526316
5430016,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I love Cirque du Soleil and have enjoyed watching its shows live and on film. This one, however, came across as hackneyed representation of warriors, capture, etc. I did not like it at all.",1391385600,,189,4.588235294117647
5430017,5,B00AIBZJS4,"If you like circus stuff and people doing amazing thing than you will love this. Well worth the time spent watching it.
Have a great day GP",1391385600,,139,4.185185185185185
5430018,5,B00AIBZJS4,Have seen some of their shows live.  Did not expect this to be as exciting but it was excellent !!,1391385600,,98,3.9
5430019,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I found the movie completely captivating.  Not only was it great Cirque Du Soleil performances, it also included a storyline that flowed through the different venues, making it surreal.  I had not seen any of the water performances before and these were sensational.",1391299200,,266,5.162790697674419
5430020,5,B00AIBZJS4,Amazing performers and the whole show was just stunning. The dancers were so talented and flexable. I watched it with my kids and we will watch it again.,1391299200,,153,4.5
5430021,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I was reading a book when my wife turned this on. In less than five minutes I put the book diwn and remained transfixed.  Absolutely five stars, a must see. We have since watched it twice",1391299200,,187,4.194444444444445
5430022,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I have seen live touring Cirque shows with my family, and we have most of their performances on DVD.  So I knew what to expect, more or less (phenomenal acrobatics, spectacular scenery, idiosyncratic music, negligible and often pretentious story),  Not one of their greatest, perhaps, but in no way a disappointment.  Many of the people who gave this DVD low ratings seem either to be newcomers to the Cirque  -  and it definitely isn't everybody's ""cup of tea"" - or familiar with the Las Vegas shows, which are of course an order of magnitude more elaborate (and extremely expensive and difficult to get into).  To describe the amazing performances on this DVD as ""boring"" or ""only tolerable when using fast forward""  suggests to me that the reviewers may sadly have lost their sense of wonder.",1391299200,,795,4.844444444444444
5430043,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Great movie, cirque is always great but this extended performance was great.  Thoroughly enjoyed it almost as good as the live performance I attended years ago.",1391299200,,160,5.153846153846154
5430044,5,B00AIBZJS4,"[warning: contains no spoilers]
A simple love story that pulls you in and yet keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Gorgeous sets and a minimum of dialogue puts the skill of these actors in the spotlight.  I would definitely watch it again which, for me, is something unusual.",1391299200,,275,4.48
5430045,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This film and the level of artistry is MAGNIFICENT! It is truly magical and mesmerizing. There are a couple of pieces that are very warlike and dark that I did not enjoy so much and wouldn't want my 6 year old grandson to see, but the rest of it I thought he would thoroughly enjoy. The music is also just gorgeous, especially all of the Beatles music. I have never seen Cirque Du Soleil in person, and in looking at their website found that there are many different shows, each of which is shown in a condensed version in this film, so one gets a taste of each of them. I highly recommend this amazing, captivating film...it is nearly breathtaking in its scope and beauty.",1391299200,,673,4.392
5430046,1,B00AIBZJS4,"We have seen Cirque Du Soleil in Orlando, Fl in person, several years ago.  It was treat to watch it from Amazon.  Even though you see a lot more when seeing it in front of you as a spectator, it is wonderful to watch it as we did this week.
Thank...Carol",1391299200,,255,3.980392156862745
5430047,2,B00AIBZJS4,Beautiful acrobatics but the story was hard to follow and very slow. Forwarded through a lot because it was so slow.,1391299200,,116,4.571428571428571
5430048,5,B00AIBZJS4,This presentation appears to be an amalgam of three Cirque du Soleil presentations.  It is fabulously done.  Makes one want to view the many other offerings.,1391299200,,157,5.0
5430049,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Creative use of different backdrops and colors to coordinate dance, swimming, and acrobatics.  Very weak on the Love Story plot.",1391299200,,128,5.4
5430050,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Few movies are suitable for the entire family anymore, but here's one to enjoy. The performances were excellent, and the story is timeless. Who doesn't like the circus, but Cirque du Soliel is so much more. Having seen one of the troupes live many years back, I am so thankful for a movie to preserve their wonderful show. Sit back, grab the popcorn and cotton candy, dim the lights, and enjoy this magnificent show!",1391212800,,416,4.635135135135135
5430051,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Got to say that a DVD lacks some of the qualities of being on the theatre, however, this DVD combines acts from 5 different shows so you get a sampling of various shows, all the while maintaining a. Credible story line.  I love it",1391212800,,230,4.2272727272727275
5430052,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Always, always great!!Best in person, but still viewing on screen is still wonderful.  love the story that's told so beautifully.",1391212800,,129,5.45

5430074,5,B00AIBZJS4,One of the most fascinating videos I've ever seen.  I saw a live show about twenty years ago.  This film did the live presentation justice.,1391212800,,139,4.52
5430075,5,B00AIBZJS4,"SINCE THIS PRODUCTION IS DONE BY JAMES CAMERON YOU GET THE ADDTION OF SOME XTRA SPECIAL EFFECTS OVER AND ABOVE THOSE BUILT INTO THE EXPENSIVE PERMANENT LOCATIONS WHERE EACH OF THESE SHOWS PLAY.
I THINK ONE VEGAS SET COST 100 MILLION TO DESIGN. AS WELL THIS SHOW IS A CULMINATION OF ABOUT 5 SHOWS BLENDED. SO IN 90 MINUTES YOU GET A GLIMPSE AT SEVERAL OF THE TOP SHOWS PLAYING IN VEGAS AND AROUND THE WORLD.
AND ITS ALL BLENDED TOGETHER WITH ITS OWN BACKSTORY SO THAT IT BECOMES ONE COHESIVE STAND ALONE SHOW. YOU DO NOT GET THE FEELING THAT ITS BROKEN UP. JUST ONE GREAT SHOW COMBINING ALL THE GREAT PROPS, COSTUMING, MUSIC, LIGHTING AND TALENT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM THIS GREAT PRODUCTION COMPANY. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO WIKIPEDIA BEFORE YOU VIEW THE DVD TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE SEPARATE SHOWS, THE COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT IN CREATING EACH ONE. YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER APPRECIATION WHEN YOU DO WATCH THIS DVD.... ENJOY!!!",1391212800,,940,4.568047337278107

5430078,5,B00AIBZJS4,a cohesive storyline of sorts with some really top notch acts very well filmed and the 3D version is the way to go. Wouldn't have the same impact were it not for the 3D effects that really put you right in the action.,1391126400,,217,4.069767441860465
5430079,4,B00AIBZJS4,Interesting mix of the Cirque Du Soleil shows.  Helped me decide which show I would like to see while on vacation.,1391126400,,114,4.428571428571429

5430082,4,B00AIBZJS4,Creative and magical. Music has interesting themes especially the Beatles and Elvis. Relaxed me into slumber at times but easily reviewed what I missed. No dialogue. Use your imagination to piece the story together  .,1391126400,,217,5.2
5430113,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Love Cirque Du Soleil but must admit that ""Worlds Away"" is not one of my favorite performances. The story line is very confusing even though it shouldn't be. Girl searching for guy in an alternative reality. The stunts were great as always, the settings were awesome and the costumes first class. Still, there was something lacking. Well let's just say: Better next time.",1391126400,,371,4.904761904761905
5430114,2,B00AIBZJS4,"Love Cirque de Soleil, but this movie does not capture the magic of Cirque live in any way, shape or form.  It put me and my child to sleep very quickly and peacefully, though.",1391126400,,176,4.176470588235294
5430115,5,B00AIBZJS4,Wonderful compendium of Cirque talent and magic!!  This show is one that I will be watching again.  Recommending to all my friends.,1391126400,,131,4.909090909090909
5430116,5,B00AIBZJS4,"These people are amazingly talented. They make the impossible appear as easy as breathing.

5430117,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I watched a few minutes of this, but could not get into it, so I stopped it. I enjoy the acrobatics of this art, but I wasn't enjoying a story around it.",1391126400,,153,3.8125
5430118,5,B00AIBZJS4,"One of the best movies. The music , colors, costumes are beautiful and the acts great.  Sit spellbound watching and will watch again.",1391126400,,133,4.782608695652174
5430119,4,B00AIBZJS4,It was very entertaining.  Music was great also. A love story of sorts that was very easy to understand while watching the movements!,1391126400,,133,4.782608695652174
5430120,5,B00AIBZJS4,A fantasy set to Beetle's music with three dimensional ballet-a visual treat. Colorful and engaging. It's Cirque du Soleil!  What more need one say?,1391040000,,148,5.166666666666667
5430121,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have never had a chance to watch a Cirque show so this was a treat. Lots of different shots that you cannot see from a theater seat so this made it both intimate and thrilling.,1391040000,,178,3.9722222222222223
5430122,5,B00AIBZJS4,From start to finish this is a wonderful presentation of the Cirque Du Soleil. The entire program is wonderfully presented.  We want to see it in person the next time we are in Vegas.,1391040000,,183,4.382352941176471

5430164,5,B00AIBZJS4,"They asked a lot of questions, but they loved it. Never took their eyes off. If you're tired of watching cartoons and want something more enjoyable without losing your kids interest, this is a winner!",1391040000,,200,4.742857142857143
5430165,5,B00AIBZJS4,FANTASTIC is the only word that describes this movie. Loved it so much. Highly recommended for the young and the old.,1391040000,,117,4.619047619047619

5430167,5,B00AIBZJS4,Have never seen such great performances!  Action packed from beginning to end.  Choreography was added to circus acts to make it even more awesome.  There is even a story line thrown in to give you some mystery. The number of acts was almost overwhelming.,1391040000,,255,4.75
5430168,3,B00AIBZJS4,"It's not the style of movie i prefer, but I believe it can be good for other people. The acrobatic performance are unique and a constant through out the movie. I did not finish the movie.",1391040000,,187,4.222222222222222
5430169,3,B00AIBZJS4,The movie was not quite what I expected but I still enjoyed it. It was very entertaining and kept me wondering what next. Such talented actors and actresses.,1390953600,,157,4.642857142857143
5430170,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Simply magical! I have no words to describe how entertaining this movie was. I have always wanted to go to a show in person, and this is even better, because you saw so much more of what goes on during the acts, and behind the scenes. I intend to watch this again.",1390953600,,264,4.096153846153846
5430171,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I have been to 4 live Cirque Du Soleil Shows and found them all truly amazing.  This movie was even more so, recommend highly for all viewers.  The creativity is out of this world....",1390953600,,183,4.352941176470588
5430172,3,B00AIBZJS4,"It started out way to slow, appeared as though it was just another chick flick, but to be fair I should say that I didn't watch the whole movie because it was taken to long too peak my interest, thought it would be about the acrobatics of the Cirque du Soleil",1390953600,,259,4.098039215686274
5430183,4,B00AIBZJS4,"About 90 percent theater performances, 10 percent movie. Cirque, the show and movie, is certainly different. Both are worth watching for something different. Would have said five stars if it was more clear if it was ""really happening,"" or just a dream for either of them. There could have been more of an encore at the finale. Makes one want to see the amazing talents of Cirque in person.",1390953600,,389,4.6521739130434785
5430184,5,B00AIBZJS4,I love anything from Cirque Du Soleil. It makes me dream everytime I watch it...I will recommend it to watch it.,1390953600,,112,4.380952380952381
5430185,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Every ""Cirque"" production I've seen is really impressive.  A bit of the awe is lost on the small screen, but this is still very worthwhile.",1390953600,,139,4.56
5430186,2,B00AIBZJS4,I assume to see it live is much better and inspiring.  I fell asleep multiple times during this movie.  Not even the kids wanted to finish watching it.,1390953600,,151,4.357142857142857
5430187,3,B00AIBZJS4,"I thought this would be similar to Allegria or other Cirque movies, this one was much more theatrical. It was good but it took a while to get to the acrobatic parts.",1390953600,,165,4.1875
5430188,4,B00AIBZJS4,"It is a Wonderful movie. Also,  describe the magic of the Cirque Du Soleil. Very entertaining story.

5430192,2,B00AIBZJS4,I like the Cirque shows but they shouldn't be padded out a full length movie. This dragged in many parts put the performances are fine once you get to them. Use the fast forward.,1390953600,,178,4.264705882352941

5430204,5,B00AIBZJS4,I love any Cirque Du Soleil performance. I went to the movies to see this one and loved watching it again on Instant Prime.,1390953600,,123,4.166666666666667
5430205,4,B00AIBZJS4,I never been in Cieque Do Solei and with this video I can see the fantastic show they present. I like the video. Interesting,1390953600,,124,4.208333333333333
5430206,4,B00AIBZJS4,Not what I was expecting. It was so much more!  I want to see them live now but cannot conceive how the live audience would be able to see all that seems to go on especially the close up shots.,1390953600,,193,3.825
5430207,4,B00AIBZJS4,good enough.  its like going to the circus or something.  if cirque du soleil is really like this then watching this for free is a great deal,1390867200,,141,4.185185185185185
5430208,5,B00AIBZJS4,I could not believe how captivating this could be.  The story was beautiful but the energy and grace performed by this gifted group was just perfect.  I recommend this to everyone,1390867200,,179,4.741935483870968
5430209,3,B00AIBZJS4,I have seen the real Cirque Du Soleil and it was amazing. This was just pretty good in my estimation..,1390867200,,102,4.15
5430210,5,B00AIBZJS4,Very colorful. Amazing talent. This is the second show I've seen by them and I was not disappointed. Loved it!,1390867200,,110,4.55

5430212,5,B00AIBZJS4,These performers are at the top of their craft.  They make everything seem so smooth and easy.  But I know it is not.,1390867200,,117,4.043478260869565
5430243,3,B00AIBZJS4,The film was well done.  I think you just need to decide if Cirque du Soleil is your thing or not.,1390867200,2,98,3.6666666666666665

5430246,4,B00AIBZJS4,"The performance,the photography, and the sets were splendid.  The only problem, and I do not think this could be avoided, is that the grandiosity of Cirque Du Soleit simply cannot be reproduced effectively on a 2-D, 47"" TV.  To fully realize all of the effects either a live performance or maybe a theater-sized screen in 3D would work.",1390867200,,336,4.775862068965517
5430247,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I thoroughly enjoy Cirque Du Soleil productions! They are beautiful and amazing. It is ballet, opera and acrobatic exhibitions all rolled into one. The stories combine fantasy and reality flawlessly!!",1390867200,,200,5.7
5430248,1,B00AIBZJS4,I've never seen a performance by them before so I didn't really know what to expect. I guess it would be better if your there in person watching it...,1390867200,,150,4.206896551724138

5430250,3,B00AIBZJS4,"The characters and story line was odd to me, but I watched for the dancing and acrobatics.  These were spectacular!  It was fascinating how every act disappeared into the water.
If the Cirque Du Soleil performers intrigue you, its a good show!",1390867200,,243,4.761904761904762
5430251,5,B00AIBZJS4,Beautifully done. We have seen a few Cirque show in Las Vegas and loved them. Watching this movie was like having the shows in your home.,1390867200,,137,4.3076923076923075
5430252,3,B00AIBZJS4,Thought it was very strange!  Not enough tricks and too much story.  Very colorful as expected but the costumes were a bit bizarre.,1390867200,,131,4.6521739130434785
5430283,5,B00AIBZJS4,It was highly entertaining and visually stimulating. Didn't quite know what to expect but my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.,1390867200,,133,5.380952380952381

5430286,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I like to think of myself as a "" Manly Man "" lol I never liked musicals and very few chick flicks. But since the 1st time I stumbled across The CIRQUE Du SOLEIL I have been amazed with their unbelievable and beautiful way of telling a story.
I for one would love to see all the hard work and blood sweet and tears that go into making these productions so unique and beautiful.",1390780800,,376,4.094594594594595
5430287,5,B00AIBZJS4,"OH man, this film is visually amazing! not just the awesome acrobats, but the colors, and the music play a major role. You will definitely find yourself rooting for some of the characters, its a beautiful adventure, it kept me engaged the whole time.
Its VERY imaginative, I would love to watch how they made this happen.
Genius.
Highly recommended.",1390780800,,349,4.833333333333333
5430288,5,B00AIBZJS4,"It was breathtaking. Really awesome, I do love shows and dance, this was just great. Definitely worth watching. My 7 year old one loved it.",1390780800,,139,4.6
5430289,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Found the first half of this so intriguing, but as the story went on it became tedious.  I'm sure as a play it was fantastic, but it lost my attention cause it became tiring.",1390780800,,174,4.117647058823529
5430290,4,B00AIBZJS4,I would recommend this show to all. I wish there were more of this variety. It was very relaxing to watch.,1390780800,,106,4.095238095238095

5430292,5,B00AIBZJS4,Beautiful and soulful something to own and play over and over . So much to see it is like watching something new each time. Music is so wonderful!,1390608000,,146,4.25
5430303,5,B00AIBZJS4,Beautiful and engaging! My six year old daughter loved it! It might be a little scary for some kids though.,1390608000,,107,4.4
5430304,4,B00AIBZJS4,"BTW, there's no speaking or singing but some kind of storyline, which the viewer may find hard to follow and really doesn't need to. I never watch this kind of stuff and don't see plays or other live performances, but even I found myself continuously entertained at the talent of the performers and stage effects (not CGI, which is really rare these days for anything).  Extremely well done, high budget, and well editted. Much was altogether mesmerizing to watch, and the musical track went pretty well w/ the action.  Some mild sensuality and one pretty strong one w/ a bikini-wearing performing bending in ways and angled toward the camera that would have anyone watching thinking more or less the same thing, though in a very artistic way. . . ahem.",1390521600,,753,4.7846153846153845

5430308,3,B00AIBZJS4,This is a typical Cirque show.  Excellent athleticism along with well trained performers.  The problem is you could not focus on the acts because of the camera.,1390435200,,160,4.888888888888889
5430309,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This is an amazing collection of Cirque Du Soleil shows as directed and edited by James Cameron, director of TITANIC and AVITAR.  My three your old grandson saw this one evening.  The next morning, he wanted to turn off cartoons and asked to watch the circus.  He viewed the entire movie, beginning-to-end without turning his head away from the TV.

It's great that with Amazon Prime Membership, you can watch a collection of shows that would cost many hundreds of dollars to see each.  Amazing!",1390435200,,495,4.776470588235294

You can watch this a few times and still miss something. Fun stuff.",1390435200,,288,5.674418604651163
5430333,5,B00AIBZJS4,This is the second best way to view a Cirque performance other than being there in person.  Brilliantly filmed and totally enchanting to watch.  We will watch it one more time to catch the things we missed in the first viewing.  I recommend this for the children as well.,1390435200,,271,4.489795918367347
5430334,4,B00AIBZJS4,I have seen the Michael Jackson performance live and know about this group. That is why I chose this one.  It was unbelievable and very entertaining. Great!,1390435200,,156,4.777777777777778
5430335,3,B00AIBZJS4,I guess since I did see a live show this was a bit anti-climatic. If you didn't see it in person this movie would be nice to view.,1390435200,,130,3.6785714285714284

5430338,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This movie was a great collaboration of the many different Cirque Du Soleil shows currently performed across the world.  It featured numerous acrobatics and great visual flair.  The only downside was the lack of a strong storyline.  The plot felt erroneous and wasn't followed throughout the film (so it seemed to me).  Still, this was a highly entertaining movie, and I would recommend to all who enjoy these types of performances.",1390348800,,432,5.042253521126761
5430339,5,B00AIBZJS4,This was an amazing movie. Love Cirque du Soleil  anyway and It just took my breath away watching the performances. I wish all their performances were on DVD.  Would recommend this to anyone who loves to get lost in fantasy.,1390348800,,224,4.575
5430340,5,B00AIBZJS4,They never cease to impress. Sometimes it may seem a little corny but I would probably act like that if I could do that too. Shipped in just in time for Christmas !,1390348800,,164,4.0
5430341,5,B00AIBZJS4,This movie is a wonderful distraction from the world and all it's problems. It rekindled the youthful joy of watching the acrobats at the circus and how amazingly graceful and talented they are. They are able to take you to a mystical place without so much as a spoken word.,1390348800,,274,4.5
5430342,4,B00AIBZJS4,If you enjoy Cirque Du Soleil then this will not be a disappointment. Amazing performances and wonderful music as always.,1390348800,,121,5.1

5430354,4,B00AIBZJS4,This movie incorporated elements of the different shows currently running in Las Vegas.  It was clever the way it was done.  The only problem was that I watched it on my Kindle Fire rather than a larger screen.,1390348800,,210,4.5

5430357,4,B00AIBZJS4,Unique and uniquly Cirque Du Soleil.  I enjoyed seeing how they put parts of different shows together into one.  This was a truly beautiful experience.,1390262400,,151,5.0

5430359,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This movie was very good but very bizarre. The stunts that the performers did we're really amazing.

It was hard to follow at first as you really don't know what's going on, but once you realize that it's a showcase of half a dozen shows or so, it picks up.  It might have helped if they somehow worked a quick preview into the plot, instead of revealing a landscape of dreary circus tents.",1390262400,,415,4.3076923076923075

5430362,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Frankly, I expected this to be kind of cheesy.  I put it on for a lark.  But then my husband, my nine-year-old son and I were completely mesmerized.  It was spectacular.  The plot that they put together to make the acts hang together wasn't all that compelling, but the acts themselves were outstanding.",1390262400,,303,4.660377358490566

5430382,3,B00AIBZJS4,"If you have the time to watch this then do so, but as so many reviewers before me the movie lacks narrative, some voice acting wouldn't had hurt the film or narrative.  The story of the girl looking for the lost/fallen Trappist  is not really there, is just the girl looking at what the performers can do and occasionally the guy she is looking for.  All in all, the movie gets boring with time, I don't wana take anything away from the performers because they are excellent at what they do, The music alone I found somewhat boring.  Again is great to watch for the athleticism of the performers, I wish I could do 10 percent of the stuff they do there I would be satisfy,  So as I stand alone movie to watch is ok, the music however is just boring as heck, it made me want to go to sleep, so much so that I had to write the review while listening to the music. A better sound effect sound effect and music would had change the feel for it. But the music does not go well with the performances and that's just my opinion,",1390262400,,1021,4.16243654822335
5430383,3,B00AIBZJS4,The video was a very low quality possibly due to my very slow Internet connection. Had I not seen the show Live I would not have been able to visualize what the film was trying to show. I would like to see it in Blu-ray. I imagine that would make a huge difference.,1390176000,,265,4.018867924528302

5430386,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Great overview of the actual performance with great acrobatics and use of visual creativity.
However, it has very weak storyline and maybe tries too hard to tie the effects together scene to scene.

5430413,3,B00AIBZJS4,It was a great chance to see highlights from several Las Vegas Cirque shows strung together with a number of songs from the Beatles'-based production. Cameron's avatar images and influence showed up a few times. It reminded me of so many French films with a two-line plot and too many close-ups of confused clowns.  Enjoy the show and ignore the actors.,1390176000,,353,4.786885245901639

5430417,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I'm sorry, it's my fault, I am too stuck on earth.  The unfathomable talent of these high-soaring  performers is amazing and awe inspiring and I've had my fill of it in about five minutes. The unquestionable talent and repeated risks taken by these flying human acrobats is so wonderful that it is probably too over-my-head to fully appreciate. The spectacle is amazing, the music appropriately entertaining. Its value of this show to me was to be reminded that I need to do serious work on lengthening my attention span. I you can sustain your love of fantasy flight and convoluted leaping for what may seem like forever, enjoy the show.",1390089600,,638,4.790909090909091

5430468,5,B00AIBZJS4,Beautiful entertainment for the whole family. Refreshing with amazing talent. Directors and producers should discover that entertainment supersedes violence and smut.,1389830400,,166,6.9523809523809526
5430469,3,B00AIBZJS4,This movie was just ok for me.  I wanted to hear the story. Some of it I didn't understand.  thanks,1389830400,,99,3.9

5430471,3,B00AIBZJS4,Transitions from scene to scene were poorly done.  Very showy but not as artistic as I had expected from the few shows I've seen on TV.  Mediocre at best.,1389830400,,154,4.275862068965517
5430472,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I thought  the actors were all in sync,it was interesting but to long. The plot was a love story I do believe,but I really did not enjoy it, not my type of movie. I think I would've enjoyed it better in person at the circus. Cirque Du Soleil",1389830400,,241,4.020833333333333
5430473,4,B00AIBZJS4,It was amazing and very enjoyable to watch such talented performers. It took awhile to catch onto the storyline but it was worth the time to watch it.,1389830400,,150,4.392857142857143
5430474,5,B00AIBZJS4,"It really is a gorgeous movie, combining all the different worlds that Cirque Du Soleil creates in their most famous Las Vegas shows. I especially loved the shots of the Beatles LOVE show as I have always wanted to see it.",1389830400,,222,4.439024390243903
5430475,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Cirque du Soleil never disappoints.  Watching ""Worlds Away"" was like having a fantastical dream. The aerial feats were breathtaking as usual, but the water aspects - I was not expecting that, and it added layers to the fantasy.  The HD on my Kindle made the colors and picture so clear.  I'll watch it again.

I did, as I always do, wonder if the songs could be translated into English (or are they not really words, as the closed captioning suggests?).",1389830400,,453,4.625
5430476,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Wow, this is well done!  Makes you want to see these performances in person.  Adults and children alike will enjoy watching this show.",1389830400,,134,4.782608695652174
5430477,4,B00AIBZJS4,"A little slow in developing a 'story' to the overall experience, as probably most Cirque fans are waiting for the acrobatic acts to be viewed. Beautiful 'Cirque' acts on display were shown in stunning video quality. We did enjoy seeing some performances of several of the Cirque offerings in the Las Vegas area, a small sample of the various shows offered there. I do recommend the video for an overall Cirque Du Soleil sampler type of experience.",1389830400,,447,4.818181818181818

5430479,5,B00AIBZJS4,"All Cirque shows are confusing.  Maybe by design.  But I think they are designed to force you to suspend reality and just let yourself go with the flow.  This story follows the same general formula as other Cirque shows and interestingly, combines elements of several other shows:  Water from ""O"", hydraulic stage from ""KA"", etc.  But it does so with a fresh look.  And watching on a small screen as opposed to being in the theater, has it's advantages as well as disadvantages.  You can see the performers close up, which enhances the telling of the emotional aspect of the story but you may miss the overall grandeur experienced when you can see the whole performance at once as a member of a live audience.  But WORLDS AWAY is a beautiful creation.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!",1389830400,,777,4.654411764705882

The artistry, performers, staging and drama went far beyond my expectations.  And add to that the benefit of sitting in my living room wearing my jammies and eating popcorn to my heart's content.  Words cannot describe this movie.  It is a must see.",1389830400,,373,4.857142857142857
5430481,3,B00AIBZJS4,Not your typical Cirgue Du Soleil film. It is a highly produced story rather than a taped live show. Still amazing to watch some of the talents of the people in the film.,1389830400,,170,4.181818181818182

5430503,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This reminded me of Fantasia, fascinating, beautiful, took my breath away, something I will watch again.  Not much of a story line, but it was fine.  Music was fantastic, great juxtaposition of intense and light hearted pieces.",1389744000,,227,5.108108108108108
5430504,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Worlds Away made me realize just how many Cirque Du Soleil shows I have seen. It also made it clear why I did not go to see the Beatles and Michael Jackson shows.

The synchronized swimming and the other acrobatics with the water were beyond amazing. The plot was a little bit hidden but you could still follow what was going on.  The ""pirate ship"" trapeze part was unbelievable even for this die hard Cirque fan.

The only reason why it did not get 5 stars was too little original content after the first ""other world"" scene. So keep it in mind that this is more of a Best Of, which isn't all bad.",1389744000,,598,4.228070175438597
5430505,5,B00AIBZJS4,Having seen multiple Cirque Du Soleil shows I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Great concept and I definitely recommend those that are fans and those that are not yet to watch this movie.,1389744000,,308,4.327586206896552

Thank you for the dazzling costumes and colors and beautiful dances.",1389657600,,333,4.39344262295082
5430523,2,B00AIBZJS4,"It's better in person. The video doesn't do the shows justice. This felt more like a commercial for the different shows they have around the country. The beginning intro was a good start, and the producer should have gone with that concept to work in the different Cirque performances.",1389657600,,285,4.836734693877551
5430524,3,B00AIBZJS4,"If you have seen Cirque shows in the past, you will notice that this movie is just loosely tied together bits of several of their shows.  While entertaining, the movie aspect and story line was lacking.",1389657600,,202,4.611111111111111
5430525,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will watch it again. The performers in Cirque Du Soleil are unbelievably limber -- they can twist and bend their bodies beyond belief! This ability, coupled with the fantastical costumes that they wear, helps to create a bizarre fantasy landscape. At times you can't believe your eyes as you try to figure out where one performer's body ends and the other performer's body begins! And death-defying moves? OMG, At times I gasped out loud! This movie has an acrobatic ""Alice in Wonderland"" feel to it, accompanied by an exciting soundtrack. If you aren't familiar with the music (I had no idea), I won't be a spoiler -- best to just listen, be surprised and enjoy! I haven't had the opportunity to see a Cirque Du Soleil performance in person but for me, this movie is even better! I wish that Hollywood would produce more wonderfully entertaining productions such as this.",1389657600,,908,4.826923076923077

In a world where most movies now are over-the-top in storyline, violence, bloodshed and gore, with cobbled together story lines that are complete nonsense and a waste of your time to watch, this gentle, colorful, exciting and highly entertaining love story is a in peaceful mental space the entire family can enjoy.

5430580,1,B00AIBZJS4,"We began watching this video with high expectations, having enjoyed numerous Cirque Du Soleil videos before.  However, there were two major problems with this one.  First, the storyline did not develop very quickly and the skits wandered aimlessly.  Second, the poor cinematography made most details hard to make out.  Most shots were very dark and shot from a distance.  This left almost no feel of connection with what happened on the stage.",1389484800,2,443,5.097222222222222
5430581,3,B00AIBZJS4,"This is actually a beautiful film, and it was fun to see all the performers of the live shows in the film.

This is more like a compilation of all their vegas shows with a sort of lazily pieced together story line which is actually much like their show O, which is featured in this film too.

You never exit the wonderland in the story line either.  The ending never brings you back to reality.  And there is no character development.

This is a film that is simply meant to show case all of their Vegas shows, or most of them and is shot in the live style just like if you bought the DVD's of the performances.

So while I thoroughly enjoyed it, I give it three stars because my expectations were based on misleading advertising.

Otherwise it is a good piece to simply enjoy Cirque Du Soleil.",1389484800,,794,4.2885906040268456
5430582,5,B00AIBZJS4,A great change from regular concerts and normal movies with just story lines.  The performers are unbelievable and the stunts remarkable.  The music excites the overall experience and all the sets designs are very nicely done.,1389484800,,226,5.25

5430605,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This was very surprising given the start of the show, a girl walks onto a carnival pitched in a open field. She enters a sideshow and within minutes you are in a different world.
How they do what they do is just amazing! I've been fortunate to have seen one of their shows in Vegas and this was just shy of being there in person.
In the credits I noticed that there were references to all of the shows being performed in Las Vegas, well worth seeing, a lot cheaper than going to Vegas. See it, you will be amazed!",1389484800,,513,4.14

I may just do that but being able to view it in HD was just as good. It felt like I was there. A very good production with a lot of time and work to excel at a Class A show.

5430688,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I love Cirque du Soleil, and couldn't believe my luck when this became available on Amazon Prime. A sort of best-of movie, pulled together around a love storyline, it exemplifies the amazing and wonderful. If I have any complaint at all, it is that at times it feels somewhat disjointed, and I believe the acts are all cut short. There is even a brief glimpse of an act (part of O, I believe) that we only get to see for a couple seconds while an ephemeral figure floats above the water. (My favorite act is the floating ship above the water - very very awesome, indeed!) I only hope Amazon sees fit to put more of Cirque du Soleil's movies on Prime.",1389225600,,650,4.336065573770492

Wonderful way to showcase all the different Cirque shows.  I will watch again.

5430728,4,B00AIBZJS4,"..visually rich productions I have ever seen... a cross between eye delight and eye-poppin' maneuvers in various, and very colorful circus applications, but a circus I have never seen before.  This is my first introduction to Cirque... and it will not be the last.  The story line was a bit weak perhaps, however, the camera work, and the physical, and athelic ability of the performers was outstanding.  Great costumes and wonderful imaginative sets... a dream that lasts for a hour and a half... got some time to relax...? .., use this as your gateway... great stuf...",1389225600,,570,4.916666666666667

5430732,5,B00AIBZJS4,What I love about this is the fantastic aspect of it. The cirque has all these wondrous acts of imagination. It was like a painting in motion. Simply beautiful,1389225600,,159,4.517241379310345
5430733,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This was a long anticipated event for me to watch and I was overjoyed to find it on Amazon. Com (unsolicited endorsement).
This was the first time I have seen a story unfold and finally come to a satisfying conclusion as a circus act!
They pulled off the story telling beautifully.

If this was a teaser to see them if they were playing locally, I would go.

Highly recommend this to all ages.  Thus the 5 Stars.  I would have added more if available.",1389139200,,451,4.333333333333333
5430734,4,B00AIBZJS4,Really enjoyed this movie. I have wanted to go watch it live and this gave me the opportunity to get a taste of the live show. I watched it with my spouse and shared it with my daughter and her family. The lack of dialogue was interesting in that the story was told through actions and individuals needed to pay attention to the whole story.,1389139200,,341,4.2615384615384615
5430735,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have seen cirque du soleil before live and I was very interested in seeing this... what a great show! wow! loved it all!,1389139200,,122,4.125

5430737,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have enjoyed attending several live performances of Cirque Du Soleil in Vegas and in tents.  They are all wonderful.  This video gives you a glimpse of several Las Vegas shows.  It is all tied together by a girl searching for a boy.  Beautifully done.,1389139200,,253,4.555555555555555
5430738,3,B00AIBZJS4,"Westarted to turn it off but my husband wouldn't let us. It was ok, I was hoping for more of the Comedy side of their shows to come on and more muscle routines, those guys are amazing with their strength and abilities.

5430742,4,B00AIBZJS4,"A very good, entertaining show. Worth the time and price. Typical of the Cirque Du Soleil shows, but not one of their best. More theatrical than acrobatics. It appears to be an aggregation of many of their recent Las Vegas shows together.",1389139200,,238,4.690476190476191

5430764,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I don't often care for musicals so I thought this would be a typical musical with circus acts instead of actors. Boy, was I wrong! This is one of the best performances I've experienced and I highly recommend it to anyone who respects the hard work these Artusts have brought to our viewing pleasure. You will not be disappointed.",1389139200,,329,4.593220338983051

5430768,3,B00AIBZJS4,"The performance got off to a slow start with dreary, almost dirge-like music. It was verging on boring and I felt it was a very poor choice of music. In the later part of the show the music switched to Beatles music which seemed to jar with the performances. I also felt they selected some of the lesser quality Beatles songs.

The music is an important part of their shows and in this case really let down the performances.

It was only part way through that I realized Worlds Away was a mash up of a number of Cirque du Soleil shows. That would account for how mixed up and incoherent it was.

By the way I am a huge Cirque du Soleil fan so this review is not just a matter of me not ""getting it"" or not understanding what they are trying to do in their shows.",1389139200,,762,4.100671140939597
5430769,2,B00AIBZJS4,This film was not what I expected.  I thought it would be more of documentary showing how they do some of their unbelievable performances.  The storyline (if there is any) was hard to follow.  It's much more exciting seeing a live performance.,1389139200,,243,4.738095238095238
5430770,5,B00AIBZJS4,if you like the other Cirque de Soleil movies you'll love this one! love the Beatles soundtrack. It was a pleasant surprise.,1389139200,,124,4.681818181818182
5430771,3,B00AIBZJS4,I've seen several of their shows in person.  Each has a detectable theme.  This is an amalgam of several shows (Vegas I think) so it lacks the usual coherence.,1389139200,,159,4.448275862068965
5430772,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This seems to be a stiching together of various acts from several Cirque shows, sewn together and patched into a loose plot. Not that that's all bad, but it was a little disjointed. But the acts, as always, are wonderful, beautiful, awe-inspiring and set to lovely music.",1389139200,,271,4.787234042553192

This is one we will watch again.
I appears to be a congealing of several Vegas Cirque shows that work very well in a film format brought together by James Cameron.  The music ranges from Cirque compositions to The Beatles presented integrally with the visual flow . . .

5430823,2,B00AIBZJS4,"As a live performance this would probably have been very interesting, but viewed on your home theater system it loses a great deal due to the difference in scale. As such visuals become too cluttered; making it difficult to follow the story.  The movie presents as a group of individual scenes, stitched together with little or no flow and too much going on simultaneously to hold your interest for very long.  The Felliniesque visuals come across like a bad pizza dream.

The amount of work and talent that go into a Cirque Du Soleil performance is evident.  Some things however, don't translate when the scale is so radically different. See them live if you can afford the price of admission.",1389052800,,694,4.758333333333334

5430873,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Having seen one of the C's shows live (in vegas) years ago, this was pleasant to see on the TV screen.  The multiple stages, costumes, and music made it all the more appealing.  The addition of the music from ""The Beatles"" and ""Paul McCartney"" and others allowed for all ages to enjoy the movie. The plot of the woman looking for the airialist from the beginning keeps you wondering.",1388966400,,383,4.536231884057971

I've seen 2 Cirque shows and the experience of being there is really important.  This has some hokey story tying the different shows together, but it really is just a long advertisement.

True to Cirque du Soleil, the story is all told through action and is minimal in plot, but the visuals in movement and scenery are a feast for the eyes. Some of the effects are a bit busy and others are just unbelievably delightful....definitely worth watching.",1388880000,,360,4.82258064516129

But we get the best of many Cirque worlds in one.  If one is going to Las Vegas and wants to see Cirque, this is a good preview of many.
It was clever how they managed to mix shows into a cohesive plot line.
I enjoyed it very much.",1388880000,,311,3.9365079365079363

That said, it is an excellent show and does have the classic underlying themes about creation and what it all means that we see in many of thier shows.  In fact this seems to be a compilation of some of the best things from KA, The Beatles Show, and Mystere.  I gave it a 5 because it really is a very good experience in and of itself.",1388793600,,417,4.0

The story line was your typical Cirque story line - sometimes it leaves you wondering how it all ties together, but for the most part it held the story throughout the ""chapters"" of the performance.  Adding the element of water gives it an especially stunning and sensual quality.  The vertical wall added a whole nother level of WOW factor.",1388793600,,470,4.9743589743589745

I found that there were parts that were ""slow"" in feature for me.  But certainly well worth watching.  There is no
running plot other than the girl is locking for her friend the acrobat.  As in true fashion for Cirque Du Soleil it has incredible

This bizarre (it is Circ after all) nonsensical, over the top movie takes what is likely a sensation live show (shows that is) and turns them into a drawn out, boring mess. One slow motion shot here or there is great, but half of the action is slow motion, which really detracts from the live feel. And the one scene that should be absolutely cool, where there is a vertical good v evil fight, defying gravity upon a huge precipice, is ruined because they nearly never show it from the place it was designed to be watched..from the audience perspective.

This was painful to sit through, and I imagine it will only really be loved by artsy eccentrics who pretend to ""get it"" (pssst...there's nothing to get) or by those who have doled out hundreds of bucks to see one of these shows live.",1388707200,,903,4.433734939759036

5431028,4,B00AIBZJS4,"As in most Cirque productions, the story line is a bit confused and hard to follow, but is really intended only as a loose way of tying together a number of really independent scenes that otherwise would seem too ""choppy.""

Each of the scenes was well done.  The performance and choreography were superb and typical of Cirque.  They did a very nice job of moving a live production to a ""film"" media.  It was like having the best seat in the house, optimized for each scene, for a live Las Vegas production.  It felt more like a live production than a movie as I am sure was the intent.

My only negative comment would be that it was about 15 minutes too long.  The ending was weak in the story line (as if the story-line really mattered).  The story line lacked a ""conclusion;"" it sort of just ended after the last scene, and while the individual performances were still magnificent, the show had begun to lose its ability to hold the audience captive.

5431038,3,B00AIBZJS4,Cirque Du Soleil has been telling stories well for a good while now.  This over-the-top dramatization is indicative of the strength and drive of producers and writers.,1388707200,,167,5.185185185185185

The mashing in of some of the productions in Nevada in 2012 caused some flat spots in the production but overall the general production contained enough good material to get a taste of the various shows.  Good for the kids, reasonable for the adults and fun for everyone.",1388620800,,395,4.850746268656716

Watching the artists encapsulated in an imaginary world replete within a story full of  color, music, unbelievable artistry and imagination is without peer.  (""Cavalia"" as well.)  In lieu of actually attending a performance the filming of ""Time"" has encapsulate a lot of what would be seen in person and done it with a beauty and elegance that some of the earlier films have not.

5431146,4,B00AIBZJS4,As always Cirque du Soleil is breathtaking this particular movie worlds away was very interesting because it took snippets from several different shows and combine them into one movie so was interesting  to see that type of perspective and the art fullness of the way they created the merging of the different shows was also very good,1388534400,,334,4.859649122807017
5431147,4,B00AIBZJS4,"the performers were great, as always.  the story was pretty bad / uncompelling though. I also thought that this would be new material, but it's basically rehashing a bunch of other cirques through the view point of 2 extremely generic / tacked on characters with no empathetic value.",1388534400,,283,4.895833333333333
5431148,1,B00AIBZJS4,"I hated to stop wasting my time within the first 15 minutes of the performance, I have seen the group live and was impressed with their skills. But to put this on Prime is an insult. I might not renew my subscription next year if Amazon doesn't come up with a better solution to provide for hit movies and what they define as ""movie"". The performers are skilled, and the aesthetics might entertain a complete pot head with nothing else better to do. I am saddened the storyline was as best cliche. These performers are so much wonderful seeing them live.",1388448000,,554,4.4950495049504955

5431165,4,B00AIBZJS4,"A great cirque du soleil film. Wonderful camera work and costumes. Terrific performances. Some really memerable scenes like the finale, water bowl, trampoline, and winged flight. Some scenes were too dark to view well so I didn't enjoy them. My son, not familiar with the Beatles, heard the music and asked me if  and why I was watching ""druggie stuff"". I didn't think the Beatles rock band scene went with the old fashioned feel of the rest if the movie.  Somehow the Elvis scene worked well though, probably because the high energy visuals took center stage. All in all, very good. I watched it twice. Need more cirque du soleil on Prime. I am doing one month trial but finding most of the movies I want to see are rentals or purchase. Not too happy about that. Still evaluating prime.",1388448000,,787,4.614285714285714

Magnificent!",1388448000,,185,4.470588235294118
5431167,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Lovely story. I often find watching a recording of a performance to be lacking... and there were moments that I'm sure had more magic live, but the film's slowing of some of the movements allows you to observe every nuance. While I'll always prefer Cirque live, this was well worth the time. For Beatles fans, the use of several songs in scenes was an added delight. However, it was a little ackward with the other compositions.",1388448000,,428,4.644736842105263

The artistry and the acrobatic talent was outstanding. I also learned that my husband did not care for this type of performance.

5431231,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Now, I LOVE cirque du soleil. I've seen a number of their dvd's. When I saw this one I thought this would be the best. I mean come on, there is so much you can do with the plot! Unfortunately...it was pretty disappointing.

What makes me love Cirque Du Soleil is that it's not just circus- there's a story that flows throughout the show and the stunts are more like works of art. This movie lacked in both. The scenes just didn't fit. They seemed to be cut out of other movies and put together.

The biggest turn-off was the variation in music. First it was mystical chanting then it turned into something else which led into elvis which somehow led into the beetles...it just did not work for me. It started out as an adventure in Wonderland and quickly turned into a 'Best of' compilation. Because of this, it felt like I had already seen most of the acts.

The story didn't flow. Each act usually contributes something to the story, but this really didn't have that. It almost felt like JUST acts and not a legit CDS story.

The only reason I gave it four stars was because I love the main couple- their act was beautiful and what I had initially hoped the whole movie would be about.

If you're not about the story and just want to watch the acts by all means watch it. If not then...pick something better or just watch it for the sake of watching it. The last act is worth watching anyway.",1388275200,,1394,4.325670498084291
5431252,4,B00AIBZJS4,"The Cirque Du Soleil is renown for producing surreal live themed shows that are fun, jaw-dropping and incredibly original. Unfortunately, even with Cameron at the wheel....its feels like ""Groundhog Day"" all over again. A mysterious circus full of strung together viginettes that leave you kind of flat.

5431260,5,B00AIBZJS4,I only wished I could have gone to see it in person. It was spactullar in every sense of the word. They had a super fantastic stage. The acrobatics and dance and high flying was awesome. I would recommend all to see this.,1388275200,,221,4.162790697674419
5431261,3,B00AIBZJS4,My only complaint is that the live show is so much more visual and has more impact. Great show but would rather see the really thing.,1388275200,,133,4.153846153846154
5431262,5,B00AIBZJS4,I really like the story and some of the acrobatic tricks were unique and really neat. I really liked the use of the water.,1388275200,,122,4.125

I was expecting the high level of visually stunning effects that is the trademark of Cirq DU Sol but adding the man responsible for Avatar into the mix was incredible.

5431324,4,B00AIBZJS4,"The movie was intrigueing, moving, colorful, pure Cirque duSoleil. However, it had the mood of a dull rainey day in some sequences, as what happens in real live stage performances, when the timing seems off, but, it's nobody's fault, you know what I mean. Well, maybe because I was an entertainer in my days, I could see and feel this, yet all of the performers were fantastic and acrobatic to perfection. A job well done. I would definitely recommend all ages seeing these shows and movies. You will be entertained.",1388102400,,516,4.7444444444444445

5431326,5,B00AIBZJS4,"The story line seems fairly thin and simple on the surface. But let yourself be immersed in the splendor of the performances and it all becomes clear. This video has raised the production quality of the genre.

5431330,5,B00AIBZJS4,I have paid to see many of the shows and loved this performance - a mix of many of the shows.  It was fun to realize what they were based on even if it was slightly different that what I had previously seen with a different vantage point.  Worth watching,1388102400,,254,4.06
5431331,5,B00AIBZJS4,This film is almost as good as seen the performance live.  Each aspect of the film is amazing and sometimes unbelievable.

The costumes and scenery are so lively.  What really astounds me is the strength and precision that these athletes possess.  It is hard to believe that we are of the same species.  I see it as a combination of ballet and gymnastics.  They lift each other into the air and catch each other in mid-flight.  The timing has to be absolutely precise or somebody dies.  I can't imagine an NFL, NBA, or MLB player that could pull off what these performers do every night.  Just astonishing.",1388016000,,628,4.486725663716814

5431349,4,B00AIBZJS4,"It was amazing to see how the movie blended sets and scenes from Cirques from around the World into one piece.  The story line was a little cheesy and had some scenes that looked like they were from an acid trip, but the visual and cinematic qualities were superb (especially in HD) and the performances were breathtaking.  My favorite scene is the inverted wall combat scene; ingenious.",1388016000,,387,4.7611940298507465

5431354,4,B00AIBZJS4,Amazing and spectacular. A way to see all of their shows in one. Breathtakingly beautiful with wonderful music to match.,1387929600,,120,5.05
5431355,4,B00AIBZJS4,"This is a film for people who enjoy romance and who enjoy visually stunning imagery. Like all good art, the meaning of it is up to your imagination.

Spoiler alert: Only read this part if you have seen the film and want to try to make sense of it:  I think the film can be seen from 3 perspectives. 1: It can be seen as a movie about falling in love. There is an instinctive, knowing first-glance between a young man and woman. Soon after they are both literally falling into the journey of their romance. Everything seems unclear and fantasy-like, just like in the romantic ""honeymoon"" phase of the first 3 months of a relationship. You tend to live in your mind about who the other person is, hanging on to your imagination's view of the person.  As you get to have more experiences with them, you then really begin to know the person. For each person there are temptations of at least one other suitor along the way, but no-one captures their heart more than each other. As the fantasy scenes become gradually more realistic, the last scene represents a consummation of their love in an aerial dance. The final image is a spinning wheel of light that could represent a celebration of their love and a sense that as time passes (spinning wheel) they will have a long, happy live with each other. 2: It can be seen as an allegory to the trials and tribulations on the journey of life. 3: It can be seen for what it is, a visually stunning fantasy of talented circus performers. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it some of the fantasy scenes seemed disconnected to each other. But that characteristic does seem like a signature to Cirqe Du Soleil story-telling. However you look at it, it is well cast, well-directed, has excellent cinematography, is inspiring to your imagination, and has a satisfying ending.",1387929600,,1829,4.553191489361702
5431356,4,B00AIBZJS4,"If you've been to Vegas to see any of the shows, you're really going to like what they've done here.

What I saw was probably one of the greatest shows I had ever seen and I have seen some awesome shows and sights in my lifetime. It wasn't anything like the circuses I had ever been to. no animals doing tricks or any of that, but a stunning display and great story even though there is very little said. If I could have one job, I think I would choose to be part of this production. That's how much I loved it. I'll watch this over and over because it is such a wild party.

Worlds away is a rambling unfocused series of beautiful scenes and astonishing performances that finally coalesces into...a Beatles tribute.  Why?  It began as a search for a lost aerialist, moving between life and death.  Not bad, and the imagery matched that thread.  In fact, some scenes are inspired.  Look at the giant tilting battlefields.  Amazing.  But then it falls apart as if the writers got tired and decided that the hallucinogenic Beatles lyrics could carry the storyline. They don't.",1387929600,,557,5.111111111111111
5431376,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Loved the video version as well as seeing this in person in Las Vegas several years ago.  This is sooooo much better than the old circus!  No live animals being caged and treated horribly by cruel, greedy people!  Banish all the old circus mess...it is so outdated!  Keep this imaginative and delightful show going!  It is great!",1387929600,,329,4.701754385964913

5431378,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I love Cirque and this was better than I expected.  It isn't just a movie of a show, but an actual movie done by Cirque Du Soleil.  While all of their shows have a theme that follows from beginning to end, this movie has not breaks and tells the story from beginning to end in wonderful, bizarre fashion as only they could do.",1387929600,,326,4.158730158730159

5431394,3,B00AIBZJS4,"We could only get into the movie for about 30 minutes, before we started losing interest and left before the film ended. It was not what we thought it may be, but I could see where some people would love to watch the circus entertainers do their thing.

5431411,2,B00AIBZJS4,"not worth the time spent, basically it is an advertisement for the shows in Las Vegas.  By the way avoid Chris Angel's  Believe. It is the worst show on the strip",1387843200,,162,4.193548387096774

5431444,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This is my first Cirque de Soleil exposure and I truly enjoyed watching this fantastic production on Prime Streaming. It's not only the mind boggling acrobatics, but the colorful and ingenious costumes, the creative sets and the beautiful music that got me enthralled with this fantasy story. Pure escapism at it's finest!  I wish to watch it again, because there is so much magical visual input, I might have missed something the first time around. Give this a try. All I know is that I was in awe of all the talent and the entire production!",1387756800,,543,4.65625
5431445,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I guess a good measure of a work of art's value is the emotional response it elicits. This did it for me. Stunning visuals, enjoyable and eclectic music choices and outstanding performances. Nobody got blown up, that was nice too.

Seriously, Amazon. I would give more ratings if there was an option to do only that. Your company emails me all the time wanting my opinion so........ Why not make it easy?",1387756800,,404,4.611111111111111
5431446,2,B00AIBZJS4,"Rather tedious to sit through. Thought it would be more interesting but it is a circus. I won't be watching it again. The romance between the characters is sketchy at best and while the no dialogue is good, I feel it would have been a little better with a little more. They're were only a couple of scenes I wish they spent more time on. Pleasing to the eye but still very confusing.",1387756800,,383,4.260273972602739
5431447,4,B00AIBZJS4,Great chance for Cirque fans to see venue and performance highlights for all the Vegas Cirque shows.  Cameron adds his cinematographer magic. A must see for Cirque fans.,1387756800,,169,5.035714285714286
5431448,4,B00AIBZJS4,The story takes you to worlds away and the people you meet is astounding- not your everyday encounter.  The acrobatics and water shows are exciting to watch.  The performers are skilled daredevils that take you to another world.,1387670400,,228,4.973684210526316
5431449,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I am a HUGE Cirque Du Soleil fan and this movie has some incredible performances but talk about a real sleeper.  I think they should have added more clowns to the movie and more hot women from Zumanity to spice things up a bit.  I watched half the movie but had to stop it, too slow and boring.",1387670400,,294,4.051724137931035

5431465,2,B00AIBZJS4,"Did not keep my attention.  Half way through I stopped watching it.  I think it was bit too ""artsy"" instead of really entertaining for me. However, as expected, most of the arcobatics are quite good.",1387670400,,199,4.6571428571428575

5431467,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I was fascinated by Cirque when it first came out, now you can see bits of all the different shows. The performers are stellar and the sets, stage and music is top of the line. Beyond entertaining, worth watching several times.",1387670400,,227,4.560975609756097
5431468,4,B00AIBZJS4,Loved it! We enjoyed its unique storyline and creativity. Costume design and props were incredible!  We'd see it again and again.,1387670400,,129,5.142857142857143

5431471,3,B00AIBZJS4,As an introduction to Cirque nicely done. But veteran Cirque fans may not be satisfied. Doesn't come close to capturing the wonder of a live performance.,1387670400,,153,4.923076923076923
5431472,4,B00AIBZJS4,This movie was very entertaining. A lot of people said I probably wouldn't like it very much because it is a little drawn out and there is no dialog. I thought that made it all the more interesting and I enjoyed it. It is supposed to have dialog. Its like watching a free Cirque Du Soleil show!,1387670400,,294,4.175438596491228

5431475,5,B00AIBZJS4,We have been to several live shows and try to go when they are close to us.  I wanted to see this in theaters but missed it.  I loved this movie.  I enjoyed seeing all the different performances and as always am amazed by the athletes that can do these shows.  It was nice to be able to concentrate on what was happening on the stage in a way that you can't do it at a live show.  Very visually beautiful.  We will watch it again.,1387584000,,430,3.941860465116279
5431476,5,B00AIBZJS4,"It was amazing production, everything was great the production, the performance, the quality of the video and the service was easy. We are actually buying tickets to see the show that is coming to town next month because of that.

5431478,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I've seen three of their shows live, but I realize that they're expensive and not in everyone's backyard.  So if you have never seen one or if you just love what they do, this is a terrific showcase and great escapist entertainment.  Don't expect much of a storyline, just enough to tie the acts (loosely) together.  But the combination of creativity, art and athleticism is over the top.  Don't miss!",1387584000,,401,4.685714285714286
5431479,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Beautiful production... Some of the music was great and unique, while some of it was just cheesy and badly recorded. Being driven visually and musically, you would think they'd want the score to be done well. Unfortunately a couple songs had a hint of southern gospel stage music, reminding me that it was more of a play than a movie. But I give it 4 for the visuals and the raw talent that is seen...so worth the watch.",1387584000,,420,4.397435897435898
5431480,5,B00AIBZJS4,First Prime Video  I've tried and had time to really Watch.  Excellent  Would like to see more Cirque Du Soleil videos/movies in future.

She almost leaves, but when a sad clown gives her a small poster of a handsome young trapeze artist, she goes into the large, faded tent to watch his show...their eyes meet for a brief instant, and they connect emotionally for a split second. Then, that second's distraction causes him to fall!  As she races toward the center of the ring, the wild adventure that is a Cirque Du Soleil performance really takes off...the two young people disappear down, down into a collapsing sandy floor and become separated. Now, she must search for him by showing her small poster to the various strange characters whom she meets as the scenes evolve into a series of mysterious worlds created through the use of huge tilting floors, fantastic acrobatics, spinning and vaulting struggles between many good and evil characters. When she finds her heroic young trapeze artist at last, will she be able to save him from the evil sorcerer?  Then, can he save her in return?

I can't imagine the process and time that goes into a performances like this. The lights, music, love story, acrobatics, water and imaginitive costumes were wonderful. There is barely any speaking throughout, and this is key to being able to put your own imagination into work. I will watch this again!",1387411200,,422,4.565789473684211
5431525,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Cirque Du Soleil provides jaw dropping entertainment as always. Everything from acrobatics, to feats of strength make you wonder how anyone is able to do that. For me this film is beautifully done showcasing all the different acts they have to offer. The only reason I don't give it a full five stars is because I feel like the story of the girl searching for the arialiest is sometimes lost in the different acts. I believe this is because several shows were used it create the whole film, and these characters are only featured in one of the shows.

All in all this movie gives you an amazing front row seat to a Cirque show that many of us can't afford in real life. It's worth the time to watch.",1387411200,,699,4.376923076923077

As expected, there were many visual treats; in fact, one could argue that the entire film was a visual treat. However, the ending was especially gratifying, a poetic expression in movement of what love means. Stunning!",1387324800,,387,4.969230769230769

5431535,4,B00AIBZJS4,This is essentially a replay of several of the existing shows with no particular thread other than a search for a person to tie them together.

A must see for Cirque Du Soleil fans",1387324800,,356,4.25

After that it's a slow slog to the end, enduring them thrashing around to Beatle's music while evil sorcerors in FuMan Chu beards and sunflower yellow robes cackle and wave around iron skillets full of flashbulbs and plastic skulls.  I don't even know what to say.  This was painful.  Watch the first half hour, then just turn it off.",1387238400,12,479,4.72289156626506

5431571,5,B00AIBZJS4,"This movie seems to captures the Cirque Du Soleil performances from multiple shows in one viewing.

Wonderful",1387238400,,283,5.042553191489362

Of course you have no idea what anything means and while the songs are beautiful almost all are foreign language and you still don't know what is going on. It really is just a sample of almost all of the Cirque's Las Vegas shows, so that is nice for someone who will probably never see them there.",1387238400,,368,4.3478260869565215

Whilst the athleticism and costuming are always world class....
The music tends to be rather cliche and myopic stylistically;
and the camera work always feels ""made for TV"" at best.

and the directing...
Most of the acts don't really flow into the others very well at all.
It's just a ""now watch this"" ok... now... ""watch this""... ok... now this...
It's like no one involved on the producing level stopped and thought of approaching a film as a film.

I weep that someone like Wes Anderson or Jean-Pierre Jeunet hasn't been tapped to helm works like these.

The result would be truly epic.",1386892800,,672,4.717948717948718

The artistic ability of the artists and their performances remind me of how much we underestimate the human potential.

In addition, the music is entertaining, and the cinematography is a testimony to the brilliance of James Cameron.  If someone is looking for a normal Hollywood story, this is not the DVD.

5431646,2,B00AIBZJS4,"I went into this film having seen one trailer and wanting to love it.  Unfortunately, I almost hate it.  The trailer is sadly misleading.

The performances are as incredible as always but none of them feel like they belong on the same stage.  Not to mention that several elements aren't present that are generally seen in a cirque du soleil production.  For one the presence of the musicians on stage,for another the two main characters don't seem to have the amount of presence in the different segments they should,and there is no crossover of performers from their own acts into others.

The costumes are overly elaborate but never seen close enough to satisfy the curiosity of what the patterns are,and there are many performers that seem to have no point except cluttering the stage which is a shame.

The scene changes are oddly abrupt.  The camerawork has a way of being in too close to the performers during moves that are best viewed from a distance and being distant from the performers on scenes that would be better viewed up close and the screen is often too filled with performers.  Perhaps the only moment that the camerawork and amount of visual stimuli on screen are perfectly balanced is during the breathtaking aerial act performed by the two lead characters, but even then the scene is far from perfect as the music is a soft instrumental rather than the powerful ballad that the scene needs.

The soundtrack in general is below par.  I miss the presence of a singer on stage such as in Amaluna or Alegria. The ethereal songs found in many other Cirque du Soleil performances would have greatly improved the atmosphere.

Overall, if you're a fan, watch any other performance before this one.",1382659200,,1711,4.762711864406779

I've seen reviews saying it's just advertisement for their shows.  Well, you know what?  More people are unable to see those shows because of cost.  This is a great way to join the fantasy of Cirque Du Soleil.",1380672000,,531,4.038461538461538

The movie is especially impressive in Blu-Ray...and definitely run it through your audio system, or you will lose the great music and sound quality.  A must see.  Only suggestion would be to provide a music CD of the movie verses a digital copy...as one would truely love playing that CD many...many times.  T. Nelson",1379203200,,521,5.08235294117647

Granted, it does not replace the live show, but in some respects it is better.  There are very close up shots and shots from unique vantage points that you will never get sitting in the viewing seats (underwater shots, shots from directly above, etc...).  The creativity and acrobatics are amazing, often times leaving me with the desire to watch it again.  With the DVD I can, but unless you are willing to pay $100 you probably are only going to see each show once.  The 3D is amazing!!",1378684800,,623,4.421052631578948

This production incorporated some of the finest performances I have ever seen by Cirque du Soleil performers, including some amazing sets and extravagant costumes. Every Cirque du Soleil show that I have seen has been greatly enhanced by the accompanying music and this one is no exception, which is especially impressive when listened to through a good Dolby Digital sound system.

And if you see it on a 90 inch HDTV in 3D you will have experienced nirvana...it's mind numbing, jaw dropping spectacular entertainment. The French have, as usual, mastered the impossible.

5431789,5,B00AIBZJS4,"My 15 yr old daughter had been asking me to take her to see Cirque Du Soleil for the last few years. However, a $60-$70 ticket is cost prohibitive for a family of 6. I was thrilled when I saw this offered on Amazon. The story is a bit slow in the beginning, but once you get through the 1st 15 minutes or so, the actual circus performances are amazing. My daughters, range in age from 8-15, all sat for over an hour watching.

Just to let you know -there is somewhat of a storyline, but there is little-to-no dialogue. If you are Cirque Du Soleil fan or is you enjoy the arialists and acrobats at a normal circus, you will probably enjoy this movie.",1373328000,,649,4.192

The Cirque is spectacular, no, that really doesn't cut it.  It's infinitely awe inspiring.  I personally have never been able to sit through what I would classify as a ""musical"".  (In my personal vernacular, that is anything set to music without character spoken word)  I've sat through this twice and if I could stay up a second longer I'd thoroughly enjoy to ""sit through"" it again.

The visuals are breathtaking, the performers are just WOW, did I mention WOW?  Yeah like WOW.

If you want a vacation from the ho-hum and hum-drum of pop culture tv, movies then you have to watch this.  What an escape, an adventure and a joy to watch!  Kudos and multiple thumbs up.

Love it.

5431792,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I've been collecting Blu-ray 3D movies (except for the animations) and the 3D effect for this movie is so well done. This is a lot better (and lot cheaper for sure) than even a front row at a live show. For example, there are several underwater shots showing the actors after they jump in the water. You don't usually get to see these on live shows. Also there are a lot of slow motion shots (using high speed cameras) that are simply stunning. You definitely can't see that on live shows.

The show itself is no less amazing. I've seen a lot of shows but there are a lot of new stunts and new concepts in this show. Half way through the show, I already came up with a list of friend whom I'll invite home to see this.

BTW, my home theater features a 3D projector and a 160"" screen. I can't say how it looks on a much smaller 3D TV.",1372982400,,833,4.104294478527607

The 3D effects were wonderful... but what ""Worlds Away"" is, in a nutshell, is a compilation of things from all of their shows put into some kind of a movie form.  I was expecting to see some new acts, etc... but that's now what I got at all.  Too expensive for not having new material IMHO",1372809600,,411,4.037037037037037

I've seen three different Cirque shows live and this 3D blu-ray doesn't measure up to actually being there and seeing it all for yourself but, it's a decent enough second. The first one I saw was Verakai and I think that may have spoiled me rotten because I saw Ka and O after that and neither was nearly as magical, mysterious, fun, inventive, creative or entertaining and neither is anything on this blu-ray. Nonetheless, as I said, it is still a bit of fun in 3D and the 3D is of really high quality. Probably as good as Avatar as far as the 3D quality goes. The music the shows presented isn't great either except for the Beatles stuff etc. If you're into 3D and this disc is on sale at or under $20 I say pick it up and experience it especially if you've never seen a Cirque show or at least Verakai.",1372636800,,971,4.170212765957447

They find themselves separated in a place between life and death. As they travel through the different worlds of the various Cirque du Soleil shows, they are helped, tempted, or hindered by those they meet.

You don't have to love Cirque du Soleil or even have seen any of its shows to enjoy this movie. All you need is the ability to appreciate the talents of the performers, the musicians, and everyone who worked behind the scenes to bring an up-close view of what Cirque du Soleil represents.  I have to admit that the first time I saw this in the theater, I didn't understand why there were so many scenes in slow motion.  Now I understand the genius behind those sequences as every time I watch this movie, I see something new and can marvel at the performers' form or the choreography involved to transition between one movement to the next.

I also have the Blu-Ray version and it is sooo sharp!

It's like being in a colorful and artistic world.

These words describe it: sensual, dreamy, colorful, acrobatic, enchanted musical

I've seen Cirque Du Soleil in Las Vegas called Mystere and I've seen other traveling shows but this

movie has some acrobatics that I have not seen before and they are IMPRESSIVE.

My favorite parts are:

- trapeze artists that slide down and catch each other's falls by their feet to feet upside down to

each other
- the 4 Chinese girls who bend over backwards and stack on each other.
- about half way through the movie, the girl in the half glass bowl was very sensual
- the 4 Beatles acts now make me want to see the Las Vegas Beatles Cirque Du Soleil.",1372118400,,793,4.383561643835616

5431833,1,B00AIBZJS4,"I never thought I'd be disappointed by a Cirque Du Soleil DVD, but this time, I was.

I own all the other DVDs available directly from Cirque, and was looking forward to Cirque's collaboration with James Cameron. Just imagine, Cirque Du Soleil plus Avatar!!

Sad to say, there is almost no original material here. This is just a ""best of Cirque Du Soleil"" collection tied together with a sad, minimal story of a ""disappeared"" aerialist and the girl who looks for him.

The worst part is that Cirque now has so many shows going in Vegas that they are no longer compatible with each other. I just can't see the Beatles mixed with ""O"", and the wonderful Cirque ""tilting wall"" shown as disconnected clips.

There was nothing gluing this haphazard mess together and I'm sorry I paid for it (though fortunately, I saved some wasted money by purchasing the streaming video, not the DVD).

First time I can ever remember being disappointed by Cirque Du Soleil. If I knew it was a feeble compilation, I never would have bought it.",1371686400,9,1021,4.65

Having bought most of the earlier Cirque dvds, I was looking forward to this one as well.  It does an excellent job of filming customized scenes of ""O"", ""Ka"" and other shows, tied together with a storyline that serves well to bridge the connection between scenes.

In addition to Cameron's cinematic brilliance in capturing the footage, I especially liked the bonus video with Erica Linz explaining how they develop the acts and the behind-the-scenes insights she shared.  And the last act is magnificent, with her and the aerialist together.  I watched this in regular bluray, not having a 3d tv, however after hearing James' insights on 3d I'm tempted to get a 3d set to watch this in that as well.  Unlike simply capturing just footage from live shows, the scenes here were shot in closeup with customized camera work, adding extra depth and camera angles only available here.

Very well done, remarkably creative and colorful, well worth watching to capture highlights of the world-class showmanship that the team at Cirque Du Soleil performs, with storytelling flair.  Bravo!

I watched this movie in the cinema in 3D and my fiancee and I both loved it so much we bought it!  Much to our regret.  Sadly, Neither Amazon nor Paramount indicated in any way, in the info distributed or on the product packaging, that we would have to spend hundreds more dollars to upgrade our Blu-Ray players AND TVs to 3D capable models in order to view that disk.  Only after I inserted it did I get a 2 paragraph discourse saying it required not only a 3D capable player, but a 3D capable TV!  And, of course, it would not play the disc.  To add insult to injury, when I registered and logged onto the Paramount website to download my digital copy I was informed by the Paramount website that not only would it not download the full version, but would only download a lesser quality version because the equipment in my PC did not meet the minimum specs for viewing it!  What makes them even think I'm going to watch it on that PC?  And on top of that they timed out my download so I could not even get that!  What's up, guys?  I've bought many 3D movies and can view them on DVD, etc., without having to have special equipment!  What's up?  Leaving out that info, of course just in my opinion, is fraudulent, deceptive, whatever!

5431902,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I love Cirque Du Soleil. You must approach each show differently and with an open mind. Expecting Nothing .. Receiving everything.
This film is phenomenal, breath taking and mesmerizing.
They seem to have taken some of the best parts from many of their shows and woven them together around a couple that ""destiny"" brings together, only to be separated. The movie entails the journey each experiences along on the path of finding one another again.
If you have never experienced a LIVE performance, this Cirque Du Soleil Movie in 3-D is as close as you will get.
It will set your senses on edge to watch the abilities of each Cirque Du Soleil performer, while admiring their strength, agility, concentration and total control of their bodies...making each move look effortless and relaxing. You will find yourself holding your breath during several scenes.
The CD is well worth the price when you consider WHAT it costs for a ticket to a live performance..IF you can get a ticket. Buy it and Enjoy. Children will love it. It's like taking them to the Circus.

We used to just be amazed that people could actually do that stuff.  Now though, it is so much more beautiful.  There is so much more drama.  It is so surrealistic.  The whole thing felt like a dream.  And, for those of you, like me, who care about it, it is also very clean.  I wouldn't hesitate showing this movie to anyone of any age

In a live show it is hard to watch everything that is going on because the shows are always so action packed. This movie, perhaps because it is watched on a TV screen seems easier to follow. It is just as magical and colorful as a live show, but without the immediacy and thrill.

I would recommend this movie to everyone -- especially those who are counting their pennies -- for the beauty and creativity of the Cirque Du Soleil experience.",1368230400,,513,4.4

I have the DVD Box set and I have seen all the shows in vegas, some multiple times.  The reason THIS dvd is so wonderful is that it covers ALL the Las Vegas Shows (well not Zarkana as it took over from Elvis and was not on when the Movie was Filmed)  and as NONE of the Vegas Shows are on DVD it is a real TREAT to watch them again.  They have managed to get some of the BEST acts from the various shows  and weave them into a simple story.  The 3 D effects make the whole thing seem real  although even without 3 D this is a wonderful wonderful film  ESP if you have children.  It is a MUST view for anyone who loves to be amazed by the incredible tenacity, endurance and skills that some people have.  And the things they can train their body to do.

I was expected a Cirque movie, instead what I got was a filming of an existing Cirque performance. That doesn't make it bad, it just makes it not that interesting if you've already seen that performance live.",1367280000,,346,4.257575757575758
5431968,4,B00AIBZJS4,"Cirque Du Soleil has always been amazing and flawless when I've seen them in person, and this movie is no exception.  But it's really just their Vegas shows filmed and pieced together with a loose story line.  I had hoped for a new show.  It os still amazing and enchanting.  The performers strength is awe inspiring and the costumes are breath taking as always.  I think if you have never seen a Cirque show in real life this is probably a good introduction, and if you've seen them and loved them this is a great reminder of why we love them.  I just couldn't give it a full five stars since it wasn't new.",1367280000,,608,4.2894736842105265

These portions got a little too weird, even from the normally weird underlying themes of the C du S shows.",1367107200,,368,4.661538461538462
5431972,5,B00AIBZJS4,What a visual gem! The color and performances were excellent. The performers were so so so talented. I enjoyed the unexpected story line. I thought the music was a bit overpowering at times but faded into the background as you became entranced with the visual effects. Worth it in every aspect.,1367020800,,294,4.784313725490196

5431975,5,B00AIBZJS4,"I'm familiar with the Cirque Du Soleil but have never seen one of their shows.  I've always wanted to but it just never happened. Any way we purchased our first 3D HD television and I've been trying to build my 3D blue ray library.  I saw this at Walmart and decided to give it a try. My sister was visiting for the weekend and I thought she might enjoy it.  BOY WAS I RIGHT!!!  The visuals for this ""movie"" are AMAZING, STUNNING, SPECTACTULAR!!!  We were in awe from beginning to end.  The reason why I write ""movie"" is because it's not really a movie. At least not to me. There seems to be a plot, girl finds boy, girls loses boy, girl looks for boy, girl finds boy again...Whatever.  Forget all of that.  Just think of yourself as having a front row seat in an amazing circus!

I have watched this at least 12 times in two weeks.  I am just in awe of the 3D effects, which are the best I've seen thus far.  And that includes Coraline and Dispicable Me, which are among the best of them.

I cannot wait to have my mother over so I can blow her away with this visual beauty!  I don't know if I would have loved this as much as I did were it not in 3D, but it is and I did!!!!

It has stayed with me as the most amazing production I have ever seen, so when Worlds away came along and incorporated elements from Ka, O, Viva Elvis, Beatles Love, Mystere, and Zumanity I was thrilled to watch a new story unfold among those familiar elements.

5432025,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I haven't bought a 3D TV yet.  I've more than taken a peek, as I've looked at passive and active technology.  The problem that I have:  while the picture quality with active is terrific, the glasses are a total pain; and with passive, while the glasses are terrific, the picture quality is terrible.  (480P per eye, with visible horizontal lines, is completely unacceptable with current passive.)  I do believe that 4K TV will fix this problem, however, and it looks like it will be going mainstream by at least 2014, thank god.  With 4K, you will have passive glasses -- those that you use at the theatre -- with 1080P per eye.  Now THAT'S what James Cameron will be talkin' about!

So, I didn't watch this in 3D because I haven't bought a 3D set yet.  But I'd imagine that this film would be pretty terrific in 3D; the cinematography is fantastic in 2D.  So, while I believe that this is a 3 star in 2D, I'm going ahead and bumping it up to 4 since I figured that that would be only fair.

With regards to the film itself, the thing that I actually noticed most:  the music.  I thought that the opening act, with the eastern influences -- harmonic minors suggesting middle eastern, followed by Asian keys from even farther east -- was terrific.  But then, seemingly, the film wanted to appeal to a mainstream American audience, and so the western music had to come out; Elvis followed by the Beatles.  I have to say that, for my taste, most of the music in the 60s, outside of Jazz, just wasn't that great.  You did have musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, however, that had real talent and brought true innovation to the music scene.  Too bad they didn't use some of his stuff instead.  And how about Miles Davis?

This film tells a story, a story that I won't discuss since that would be a spoiler.  But I liked that; it wasn't a bunch of acrobatics thrown in willy-nilly to just show off.  At least there was a common thread that ran through the film, even though that thread was occasionally broken by varied music, some that I liked, some that I didn't, discussed above.

Like I said, in 2D I'd say 3 stars.  But I'm sure that in 3D it will be 4.  And I can't wait to get that 4K TV so that I can pop on those passive glasses and watch this film again in 3D with 1080P per eye.  And those glasses won't put too much pressure on my nose, or risk battery death midstream.",1366156800,,2372,4.324263038548753

Just a little snippit of shows that I have seen live and also some I haven't seen and now hope to in the future.

5432061,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Worlds Away is a magnificent Cirque du Soleil composite of Ka, O, and Love (three Cirque shows in Los Vegas) by James Cameron and Andrew Adamson.  It another trip into the magical fantasia, musical, dance world of Cirque du Soleil.  I have loved those I have seen live, and those I have on dvd.  This is a magical kingdom unto itself to be enjoyed and savored as a sweep of wild imagination.  There is a love story here, and it plays louder than usual in a Cirque production.  The artistry, the gymnastics, the athleticism, the scenery, the costumes, the colors swirling are wonderful. The music is marvelous.

The cheap circus is played to the hilt in the opening scenes.  Then the magical circus takes over and buries the listener with wave after wave of the magnificent scenes from Ka, O, and Love.  I have only seen one of these, and want to see the other two even more now that I have had a taste of them.  But to enjoy this you have to let your imagination run wild, accepting lots of motion, characters, and superfluous action.  But that is the fun of the Cirque style - Beautiful action and costumes with lots of gymnastics, athleticism, surrounded by swirling music unique to this world. Of course, much of this does not make sense in the usual sense of a movie or even a circus.  You just have to ride with the flow, awed and mesmerized by the wild imaginations that dream this stuff up.

I applaud Cirque du Soleil for allowing James Cameron and Andrew Adamson to take scenes from their shows, merge them into another sequence, and make more mystery and magic for those of us that love Cirque.",1365292800,,1604,4.493103448275862

5432094,5,B00AIBZJS4,"THIS IS REVIEW FOR AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO VERSION OF THIS VIDEO:

Before I downloaded the Cirque Du Soelil Worlds Away from Amazon Instant Videos, I had already seen the DVD video of Cirque Du Soleil with a friend who rented it. We watched it on a 60"" TV screen and I totally loved the video (enough to want to own the video). And sadly, it was a just a one day rental. So after viewing this video on a large screen, I ""tried out"" the trailer here on Amazon to see how it would view and sound on my Samsung Tab 2 10.1 Tablet. I was totally blown away!!!! So I downloaded the full video and have watched it OVER and OVER again.
What I love about movies/videos on Amazon Video, keep your place so you can go right back to the movie/video later and just resume your viewing. What is so great also is the PICTURE QUALITY IS SUPERB and SOUND SUPERB!
Yes, I do agree with previous viewers: That this is a mixture of previous Cirque Du Soleil shows. However, in my opinion, it has some of the greatest scenes from several of the shows and they work it into the very simple storyline: Girl sees young man performing (The Aerialist), then falls in love and wants to meet him, this is how the story begins, yet I felt like it took me ""Worlds Away"" in the outstanding footage that lead to the exciting finale. The finale is where the girl and the Aerialist fianly get together and perform together. This part I have played over and over and over as it is so beautiful. The price I paid for this video is so worth it and yes, it plays perfectly in FULL SCREEN on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. Love this video and I recommend it to ALL!
Also, thank you for reading this review, I hope it has been of help to you.",1364774400,2,1697,4.173780487804878

However.

As a person who has been corrupted by society, there was nothing in this movie that I haven't seen 100 times in other movies.  Special effects have ruined me.  I can still appreciate the beauty and the incredible muscle power it would take for these guys to pull off their movies, but I wasn't necessarily transfixed by it.  I would probably feel differently had I seen it in person, though.

The story was odd.  I almost would have preferred just no story and a film of just the awesome gymnastics and acrobatics displayed.

It kind of reminded me of Mirrormask in the way it's done.  Kind of odd and dark and a movie that seems like a kid would enjoy, but when you watch it you find that it's a little bit dark and twisted in a way that a child doesn't really need to be exposed to.

There was color, but it was muted. There were few close-ups of the excellent performers. I wanted to see their faces that would give them personality.and  the clothes that adorned their bodies, things that gives them greater interest and personality.

I would have preferred to see their wonderful backgrounds presented with better color without darkness. Then I'd like to see the individual artists do their great presentations that would lead to another artist doing another great stunt. Mayby a lesser act could be preresented in between.

5432131,4,B00AIBZJS4,"I looked forward to seeing this and then half way through I had second thoughts for four good reasons.
One...Can't tell the men from the woman.
Two....No face to relate to or a star to draw you in or pull for.
Three....Poorly edited and skips all around in two second looks, so you never get to really see anything.
Four.....Music was bizarre and could have been used so much better.

Now...half way through the movie changes, and most of this is fixed. They even play Beetles songs some of us know. The talent level from start to finish is remarkable to say the least. The settings and costume, lighting and make-up are simply excellent. Good for the whole family to watch if you can get the kids to sit down that long.

I always sit within the first 5 rows and have not been disappointed. 5 Stars for the live shows!

I really didn't like the plot (if you can call it that), about a girl searching for an aerialist, basically giving the film a venue to pass from scene to scene of the various shows which include the ones I mentioned except for Michael Jackson. If you like this type of acrobatic entertainment, you will enjoy this movie. I am pleased to have it on 3D to show my guests something out of the ordinary.

I felt that the other two shows I saw had scenes that were very elegant with a lot of fluid movement and played with light/shadows very well. Some of the scenes in those shows were really moving, but in this show, I did not feel that. There were a couple of scenes I liked, such as the last one and the one where a male acrobat is working with an open cube, and I thought they could've done more interesting things with the vertical wall scene. A lot of the movie seemed really random, but I expect that from these types of shows. Overall it was just OK. Maybe I would've enjoyed it more had I been able to see the whole thing live.

WOW!  A real VISUAL FEAST.  Incredible talent and imagination. (This starts a bit slow but hang in there, you get used to the pace and it's a great show.) I always wanted to see a live performance in Vegas but it's pretty pricey for me and will probably never happen - so I was THRILLED to have the opportunity to see them perform in this movie.  I was not disappointed at all!

The acrobatics, the skill, the choreography, the fantastic sets etc. are about impossible NOT to appreciate.  The acrobatics, by the way, are somewhat creepy at times but even still you just can't help but appreciate the incredible control and talent of these artists - it's fantastic, sometimes sensual and perhaps erotic (but G rated so it's ok for the kids to watch)

I believe you have to think of this movie like watching a weird dream - a circus kind of dream. And, you don't have to ""understand"" it to appreciate it.  Just enjoy the show, the costumes, the talent, the cool sets, the pure fantasy of it all.

There IS a loose ""story"" of sorts to this dialogue-free show...  A young girl goes to a circus and is watching an aerialist IN WHITE PANTS who falls (30+ feet?) to the sand of the circus ring floor which collapses to suck him in (like falling into the sand in the top part of an hour-glass).  She rushes from the audience seats to help him when he falls and gets sucked in too - into another circus type world/dimension.  Turns out he's been ""captured"".  She see's many cool circus acts in this new place as she looks for him.  And there is a ""battle"" of sorts (all on visible wires, but it doesn't matter that you can see the wires because it's just cool to watch and you can't help but appreciate the precision of choreography and all to keep that many wires from getting crossed/tangled while they do all this, and - small spoiler:  the captured (WHITE PANTS) aerialist is freed.  Once freed, he goes wandering around and like the girl, he also sees some incredible things.

About 3/5 of the way through, the WHITE PANTS aerialist and the girl almost find each other but are kept apart.  The girl seems to walk out of the circus tent area (back to where they fell through??) and a group of the people that helped rescue the WHITE PANTS guy come across her and she tries to show them the flier/picture of the guy she's looking for but before they can help her they are attacked by creatures and the girl falls into a chasm or something. (Then comes a spiked wall fight with NO wires).

Eventually, the girl wakes up in a safe place and the guy in the WHITE PANTS finds her and they do some aerial stuff together, flirt, play and fall in love...

All in all it's pretty cool - fantastic even.  Sit back and enjoy the dreamlike fantasy - worth watching more than once!",1363132800,38,2765,4.3843137254901965
5432172,5,B00AIBZJS4,Absolutely stunning visuals! I couldn't wait to see this and it lived up to my expectations. I can't wait to see Cirque du Soleil when they tour our area again. They are worth every penny to experience the magic.,1363132800,,212,4.461538461538462
5432173,5,B00AIBZJS4,"Ok, first off, if you're watching this, the plot is very simplistic.

Girl meets Boy at the local Circus.  Boy isn't quite the Aerilest he's promoted to be and falls through a hole in the floor.  Girl gets sucked into the pit as well, but she's still enamored with the Boy and spends the rest of the movie going through the various Worlds of Cirque Du Soleil to find him.

It's that simple people.

If you keep that concept in mind through the movie and don't over-analyze it, you will *love* this one!

Other reviewers have said, this is the best of the best of Soleil.  And they're right.  It truly is a complilation of moments from some of Cirque's greatest works and well, well, *well* worth watching.

But, if you've never seen a show of theirs before, it might seem a bit ""mashed"" together.  In some places it is.  However, Cirque is well known for the story underlying the aerobatics, music and costumes.  And if you keep the minimal plot above in mind and watch for the Girl and the Boy as it goes, you will enjoy yourself.

The feats of strength, air-work and death defying moments set to some beautiful instrumental music will have your jaw dropping, heart pounding and leave you well satisfied with your decision to see this flick!",1363046400,3,1242,4.515695067264574
5432174,5,B00AIBZJS4,"One of the most beautiful films you will ever see. Having seen Cirque de Soleil live I can say this is as close as you can come to actually seeing it in person. The story is practically devoid of dialog, which of course is how it should be since the story is told in a purely visual manner.  It does require some thinking and interpretation of the almost staggering amount of symbols throughout the movie. But it is not as complicated as one might assume, since the main story line is very simple. Even at that, it is so beautiful and at times so breathtaking that you just need to sit back and enjoy. You are constantly amazed by staging, the colors, the costumes and above all by the artistry of the performers. Let's not forget the great music of the Beatles and its both humorous and wonderful interpretation in the film.  If you have been lucky enough to see Cirque de Soleil in person this is a must have movie, if not, this film will make you want to attend a live performance of this wonderfully artistic show.

This G-rated fantasy can save you a fortune in tickets because it has excerpts from five or six spectacular Las Vegas shows, and you know how much THEY cost! Among them we see selections that feature Beatles music, Elvis music, a water ballet, and some extremely athletic work that looks like it's drawn from a Chinese opera (or at least like the one I saw at the opera house here in Seattle).

This show features a flimsy plot built around a sweet attraction between a lovely young French-looking woman (Erica Linz) and a strapping young fellow (Igor Zaripov) who looks Russian.

You can expect:
  * Astonishing aerial work (I expected applause like Seattle's Teatro Zinzanni);
  * Cleverly choreographed synchronized swimming (a salute to Esther Williams);
  * An engaging little tricycle that leads our heroine from place to place;
  * Rubber-boned gymnasts (you have to see them to believe them);
  * Athletic martial arts (Jackie Chan trained in Chinese opera as a child);
  * Gigantic crustaceans and centipedes in a menacing dance;
  * A Spiderman-themed bit on trampolines;
  * Mind-boggling special effects with flowing curtains and streaming sand;
  * A lovely aerial pas de deux for the finale.

This is a visual feast with unbelievable athletes in outrageous costumes showing us their amazing stuff. Not much plot, but we don't go to Cirque du Soleil for plots! We go to be dazzled and we are! This one is almost worth the extra for the 3D.

It's comforting to see all the safety lines on the amazing rigging for these shows. This would mean full employment for every theatrical rigger in Las Vegas. Many of you watch the spectacle; I watch the logistics. Wow!",1356652800,25,1917,4.777439024390244
