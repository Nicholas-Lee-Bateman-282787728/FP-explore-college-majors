8137613,5,B000H8RZKI,"Summer, 1990. I had just finished my first year at Georgia Tech, and had a summer job at Editworks, a TV and video post-production company in Atlanta. My major tasks that summer included building a video switch, servicing an old film cleaning machine, installing their very first digital video tape recorder (a Sony D2 machine, if I remember correctly) and transferring this film from a 35-millimeter print (how'd they pay for that?) to 1-inch video tape, ostensibly to cut trailers and other media pieces from.

The present. Finally, I have actual proof that the film both exists and is as gobsmackingly awful as anything Ed Wood ever created. The opening credit sequence, which like a James Bond film really has nothing to do with the story, neglects to even mention the name of the movie; it's left for a title card and voice-over at the end of the first actual scene. Cuts between scenes seem to be timed randomly and it appears that sometimes the editor forgot that the scene has actually ended, leaving the viewer with an empty static frame from which the action long ago departed. Other scenes tend to end abruptly, leaving the viewer a bit lost and thinking there's something missing.

The story: a psychotic Elvis impersonator goes on a rampage killing rivals until a local impersonator-turned-newsboy is possessed by the ghost of Elvis himself to save the day. But he doesn't save the day: the bungling incompetence of the antagonist proves to be his ultimate undoing.

In case anything of this movie actually besmirches the good name of Elvis, never fear: not a single Elvis song is harmed in the performance of this thing.

If you like bad movies, this is something *not* to miss. I actually enjoyed this movie, and it was fun to share what was until now an apocryphal piece of my personal history with others :)",1305849600,,1824,4.780952380952381
