  One element I really like about the Distilleries episode are the vignettes w/ the bartender giving basic information about how to mix some of the more popular cocktails.",1393372800,,357,4.916666666666667
8289272,3,B001CU7OTM,"""Distilleries"" provides a brief outline of the manufacture of several major product-lines including whiskey, rum, gin, tequila, and vodka.  Viewers also learn that these processes began around 3,000 B.C. in Pakistan, that 18th-century England and the U.S. consumption was partly to replace unsanitary water, and that Prohibition cost the U.S. Treasury about $500 million/year.

Water is a key ingredient - for whiskey limestone-rich (hard) water without iron is ideal.  Aging inside oak barrels (charred internally) for 2-40 years also contribute important flavors and color to American whiskey; used once, they are then sent to Scotland and used to make Scotch.  Scotch reportedly is aged 12-40 years, with 2% evaporating/year - reportedly the ""angel's share.""  (Seems a bit far-fetched - means 80% is lost over 40 years.)

Blue Agave Tequila is made in Mexico.  The plants take up to 12 years to grow, and the main stems (absent the sharp leaves) weigh 45-220 lbs.  Cloning is now being used to create greater uniformity, larger yields, and less disease.  The average agave plant yields 9 bottles of 100% tequila.

Finally, we get to vodka. The product is distilled 4 times, and then filtered multiple times, reducing the severity of hangovers.",1221782400,8,1246,5.247474747474747
