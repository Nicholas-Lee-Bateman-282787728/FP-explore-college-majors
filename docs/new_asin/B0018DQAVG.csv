8269623,3,B0018DQAVG,"This is Carol Butler's son.  My mom bought this collection for me for Christmas in 2004 mainly for ""The Lucy Show"" on discs 7-10.  I can honestly say that I've seen much better collections of classic TV shows, but for 15 DVD's at only $25 back then is a pretty good deal.  The quality of the shows is pretty good considering the age and the company that released this set (Madacy).  Of course, ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Bonanza"" don't contain the original theme music, which is a minor setback, but you get what you pay for.

Discs 1-3 contain five episodes each of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", making 15 in all.  Discs 4 and 5 contain five episodes each of ""The Andy Griffith Show"", making 10 in all.  Disc 6 contains three episodes of ""Bonanza"".  Discs 7-10 contain five episodes each of ""The Lucy Show"", making 20 in all.  Discs 11 and 12 contain six episodes each of ""The Red Skelton Show"", making 12 in all.  Discs 13 and 14 contain over 200 classic commercials from the '50s-'70s.  Disc 15 contains six episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".  Overall, a very nice collection.  The content gets five stars, but the quality gets three.  I'm not sure if this collection is in print anymore.  If you love classic TV, then this set is for you.",1268956800,,1272,4.517543859649122
