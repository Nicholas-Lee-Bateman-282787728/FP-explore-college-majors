7385372,5,B0147OOZF0,Everyone is crying as if this movie wasn't an amazing movie.. it has plenty of screen time for both parties and I enjoyed it from beginning to end.. it did an awesome job of showing the cleverness and hilariousness that ive come to expect from Lupin the 3rd and the way they put these two against each other was a very good idea.. the fact that they haven't already made a part 2 is crazy to me.. if you like ether of these shows you should love this movie.,1455148800,,457,4.146067415730337
7385373,5,B0147OOZF0,"I enjoyed both Lupin/Conan crossover specials.  They are well crafted and very entertaining.  Not dubbed, but with English subtitles.  I usually like movies with both options; dubbed and Native Japanese, if I have something on and am mainly listening, it is often easier to do so in English...Japanese has many nuances that I don't catch when just listening...(age I guess).  BUT most English voice casts have a weird idiosyncratic problem...they try to emulate the Japanese speech and voice actors and often sound like they are screeching or yelling all the time.  So I only put these on when I can actually sit still and watch them.

The story is OK, not great, as it has to serve two masters (Lupin and Conan) but it doesn't do a disservice to either one.  Both characters stay true to themselves, and learn a little about the other.",1453161600,,836,4.763888888888889
7385374,2,B0147OOZF0,"This film is NOT dubbed in English as the product details page says at this time ( Nov 2015). The only avalible audio language is japanese. The DVD was also loose in case when it arrived. My disc had only slight marks from this.

The only reason this DVD was purchased was due to the English dub claim. I did watch the film and enjoyed it. That is why I am weighting a review rather than returning the DVD.",1448582400,4,406,4.139240506329114
7385375,4,B0147OOZF0,"This is a very good crossover of two classic series. I disagree with the opinion that the Conan cast dominates the film with the Lupin cast getting little screen time. Yes they appear slightly less and this is a Conan Special, but that is because the audience learns the story through the Conan characters, which I think was the correct way to do it. I want to give huge thanks to Discotek for using the actual Detective Conan character names instead of the made up ones used in other English releases.

The only negative aspects I found were the large number of ""typewriter"" scenes that tell you where and when the scene is, there's so many unnecessary ones that it takes you out of the moment, and the animation. I am a fan of old school anime, modern computer animated art is crap when compared to the classic hand drawn stuff and when it is combined with 3D generated aspects its even worse. When the special first started it seemed a little blurry to me, although I noticed it less as it went on. Come on Discotek get us the second and third Lupin series and more Conan! All hail Discotek!",1446940800,2,1094,4.442786069651741
7385376,4,B0147OOZF0,"Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan: The Movie was apparently a pretty big deal in Japan where it was nominated for the Japan Academy Prize for Animation going against films like The Wind Rises and The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Its also the highest grossing Detective Conan film of all time. Depending on taste many could consider this the most attractive film ever featuring Lupin III. I happen to be a huge fan of Hayao Miyazakis artistic style but it would hard to deny that this is an extraordinarily slick and appealing film. Its certainly a step up from the made for TV Lupin III vs Detective Conan which came out in 2009 and that one wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.

This movie bears a lot of similarities to the made for TV movie. For one thing its very much a Detective Conan movie that just happens to contain Lupin the 3rd. In fact Lupin disappears from the film for quite a bit of the running time. I would estimate that Jigen gets more screen time than his famous boss. The plot is very difficult to follow and really meanders along. Lupin is being blackmailed into stealing a gem lest Fujiko has her head blown up. Meanwhile, Detective Conan and his crew are dealing with a handsome Italian pop singer whose life has been threatened if he goes ahead with his next concert. There is some kind of undefined major deal going down at the concert but its hard to know how it relates to the threat to the pop star or the stolen gem. Near the end Detective Conan sort of explains the mystery but not entirely. Im going to need to re-watch the film to see if I can figure it out and this really doesnt seem like the kind of film that should require multiple watchings because of complexity.

There are moments I really enjoyed. The explosive opening has a real cinematic feel to it and I did enjoy the interactions between Jigen and Detective Conan. For whatever reason Goemon has barely any presence in this film or the made for TV movie but Fujiko and Zenigata get sufficient screen time even if the characters from Detective Conan tend to get first priority. I would suggest if you're going to watch this film that you watch the made for TV movie first as this one is a continuation of the story. One thing to note is that just like with the TV movie this one us English subbed NOT dubbed. Regardless of the plot this is one damn good looking film. Lupin has never looked so good.

Update: Having watching the film a second time the plot really doesn't improve. I caught a few more things the second time because I was really paying close attention but the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's also a shame that I can only watch it in subtitles because the animation is so lovely. Unfortunately my eyes are constantly bouncing up and down as I try to enjoy the visuals while reading the subtitles. Make sure to watch all the way through the closing credits because there is some bonus material afterwards.",1446508800,10,2934,4.449814126394052
7385377,4,B0147OOZF0,"Ive been watching Lupin movies for probably around two decades but this is almost assuredly the closest US audiences have ever gotten a Lupin film relative to its release in Japan. Lupin III vs. Detective Conan was broadcast in Japan in 2009 which was over 6 years ago but as of 2015 US audiences were getting their first look at Lupin films from the early 90s. Its partner film, Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan: The Movie, was released in 2013 so its practically brand new. Hopefully this is a portent of things to come and we will see faster US releases in the future.

Im coming into this film as a big Lupin III fan having read the manga and watched pretty much every film thats available in the west. I knew nothing about Detective Conan but after some research discovered hes a popular Japanese character whos been around since 1994. Like Lupin he got his start in Manga and then moved to Anime as he became more popular. Character Jimmy Kudo was a renowned detective at 16 years of age but because of reasons I won't get into (check Wikipedia) he regressed in age by probably around 8 years and changed his name to Detective Conan in an homage to Sherlock Holmes writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Hes basically a Japanese version of Holmes featuring preternatural powers of deduction except hes a teenager living in a pre-teen body.

The truth is this movie is clearly a vehicle for Detective Conan that features Lupin III.  The characters from the Conan universe get far more screen time. The story is loosely based on The Prince and the Pauper. In this case Ran Mori, a character from Detective Conan, discovers she bears an uncanny resemblance to a Princess and the two end up swapping places. Problem is that someone is attempting to kill the princess so its up to Detective Conan to find out who and protect his friend Ran. Meanwhile, Lupin is attempting to steal the Royal Crown which is protected by a security system so airtight that he already failed once.

As a huge Lupin fan I was disappointed at how he got short shrift to the diminutive detective. Putting that aside the story is just sort of ok. It doesnt have the feel or pacing of a Lupin movie so I assume its because its a Detective Conan story. I can accept slowness in a story if the writing is intelligent and engaging but there are more than a few problems with the script. For one thing it makes no sense that Ran and the princess could resemble each other so acutely that even Rans own father struggles to distinguish them since Ran is Japanese and the princess appears to be Caucasian. Another issue is that although the story is presented as a mystery for Conan to solve but the villain is so obvious that I don't even think the movie is trying to hide it. Even the characters all just assume correctly who is behind the attempted murder. When Detective Conan reveals his linchpin clue its a depressingly overused trope. The title of the movie is also deceptive as Lupin and Conan never really work against each other.

This is not in any way a terrible movie but I cant deny I was disappointed. To start with the movie is NOT dubbed into English as the product description states. This mistake is quite common with the Lupin movies. The animation is aesthetically pleasing but often uneven which isn't surprising given that this is a made for TV movie but the plot is where it really falls down. Lupin vs. Conan looks pretty good up on the screen but for pure enjoyment I would put it in the bottom half of Lupin movies. I really hate to say that because I really want Eastern Star to continue bringing over Lupin movies. There is a SECOND Lupin III vs Detective Conan movie that was released in the theaters and having just started it I can declare that the animation is excellent. I will review it next week with hopes that it has a better plot.",1446076800,7,3831,4.498563218390805
