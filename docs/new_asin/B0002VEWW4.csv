2126363,5,B0002VEWW4,I think this documentary is great. I am the first one on and the last one off. The information in this documentary is about as accurate as you can get.,1347926400,2,151,4.066666666666666
2126364,4,B0002VEWW4,"Overall, I found this to be a very good documentary, about Elvis' life, from childhood, up thru his untimely, early death. It covers how he became addicted to amphetamines (a stimulant drug), when he was in the Army, in Germany. Also, it covers how, he eventually had to take ""downer"" drugs, to go to sleep, and to counter act the stimulant drugs. It covers his career, and personal life, very well,but the only thing, that was missing, was his tenure on the Louisiana Hayride Radio Program, live from the historic, Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. It was while he was performing for the Louisiana Hayride, that he became very popular, and famous. Before, his tenure on the ""Hayride"", he performed on the Grand Ole Opry, but he was dismissed, and told to go back to driving a truck.

Overall, it's my opinion, that it's a pretty good documentary of Elvis' life. I just wish they had covered his time on the ""Louisiana Hayride"", in Shreveport, Louisiana. By the way, they re-named the street in Shreveport, where the historic, Shreveport Municipal Auitorium is located. It was re-named Elvis Presley Blvd. Also, in front of the building, there is a statue of Elvis, along with a statue of his TCB (Taking Care of Business) Band, guitarist, Louisiana Native, James Burton. If you ever get the chance, I would highly recommend visiting the historic, Shreveport Municipal Auditorium, because, it is now a museam. Thanks!!!!",1301875200,2,1419,4.937238493723849
2126365,2,B0002VEWW4,"This is the first documentary that turned out to be a two-fer.  The second ""A Generous Heart"" made me want to see the first so I decided to buy it if I could locate it.

!  LOVE the video but hated the packaging  ..  there was NONE!!  Not even one of the cheesy plastic cases you can buy at Walmart.  I should have known that since the price was so low that something would be amiss.  Someone oughtta sell them as a set BUT WITH THE DVD CASE!!!!",1297641600,2,445,3.977272727272727
2126366,3,B0002VEWW4,"The dvd was okay but I have so many of his documentaries that it was just a little boring in spots.  It was just another dvd of Elvis from other people's point of view.  They all have their opinion and some are very different from others. First he is very good, then the next, he has a lot of demons to contend with.  It does get a little confusing.  I just loved Elvis because of his beautiful voice and his (I think) great acting skills, that he never really got the chance to perfect, thanks to Mr Parker.",1262995200,8,508,4.153061224489796
2126367,1,B0002VEWW4,This DVD has a very cheap homemade feel.  I did not like it at all.  I would recommend saving your money!,1230940800,4,105,3.9523809523809526
2126368,1,B0002VEWW4,"My grandmother received this DVD as a gift from a relative, and unfortunately I had to watch it when I went to visit her on Christmas day.  I am also an Elvis fan and I enjoyed watching his performances in the past.  In my opinion this appears to be very amateur attempt to make money off the Kings name!  I wish I had that hour of my life back and could have spent it just visiting with my grandmother.",1230940800,3,403,4.075949367088608
2126369,5,B0002VEWW4,"Gosh, I disagree with the 1st reviewer.  I'm so happy to see anything new on Elvis, even older film clips that are not so sharp at times.  I really loved the history and pictures of Elvis in this DVD. I liked the music also.  I'd definitely recommend this one.  The price is easy on the pocketbook too.  No, it's not a $59.99 special package but at the Wal-Mart price of this one I'm so happy to have gotten this.",1187913600,,413,4.177215189873418
2126370,5,B0002VEWW4,"A lot more information about Elvis from different people who were interviewed that knew Elvis.  A lot of footage where he grew up in  Memphis.  The narrator had researched a lot of information about Elvis through archive and it is very touching how Elvis became famous and did not forget where he came from and the people he grew up with.  Elvis is indeed  very generous and very religious person.  His life ended, but his memory still lives!!

I was born in 1951, I did not know Elvis way back then.  I started buying his DVDs and CDs just few months ago and I am touched by the way he generously had given most of what he had to charities, to his friends and to people who came to him for financial help. Deep in Elvis heart, he seeked for God, and his Gospel songs proved it. I highly recommend this DVD to own!!",1168300800,13,815,4.246753246753247
2126371,1,B0002VEWW4,"I bought this DVD at Wal-mart for about $11.  I took it home and watched bits and pieces of it.  I was just too board to sit through it all.  I hate it when I read the back of the DVD and it states that there are rare footage's on this DVD.....Horse Hockey!!  If you got the DVD's and Video's of Elvis In Hollywood or Elvis 56....then you'll won't see any new footage on this DVD.  In this DVD you'll here this corny music.  This DVD has a POOR and CHEAP quality.  There is this one guy that is a fan club president up in New York that's teaching the wrong versions of the stories of Elvis.  I wish I could kick his rear for claiming he is an expert on Elvis history.  Don't waste your money.... Fan's like us get sucker into these DVD's and wish they can get their money back... I threw mine in the trash and said the hell with this Crap.... I can't wait for ""This Is Elvis"" Special Edition to come out.",1099094400,34,904,4.033707865168539

Nothing he did what he said he would do. Elvis, asked President Carter to give him Goverment agents to protect him, President Carter told him no, only the President was authorized that kind of protection; however, he said, ""I will recommend you for the witness program!

There are only a very few musical performance by or film of Presley, and these  appear to be  public domain.  Even the background music seems to be stock.  Most images of Elvis are photographs.",1407715200,3,262,4.863636363636363
2126593,4,B0002VEWW4,Thought I'd seen everything on Elvis so this was a nice find.  Well done and indeed worth a watch for us old diehard Elvis fans.,1406246400,,128,4.12

2126595,1,B0002VEWW4,If you don't have any idea who Elvis was this would be an ok introduction. For anyone who is more then a distant fan this was a complete disappointment. 90% of Elvis time was photos. The key person is the head of the EP fan club in New York. My advice is don't waist your time.,1400457600,5,277,3.9642857142857144
2126596,1,B0002VEWW4,I wanted to be after watching this really boring documentary.  He was made by his Agent.  But I really never liked his work anyway.,1398556800,2,131,4.416666666666667
2126607,2,B0002VEWW4,This was like reading a book about Elvis. I expected more than flashing photos and narration. I was very disappointed.,1398556800,2,118,4.95
2126608,3,B0002VEWW4,"This is history only, not much music or live performances. If you just want the Elvis story this is a good choice. I would have enjoyed
it more had it had some music or clips from live shows. Overall a pretty good watch.",1398297600,2,220,4.1395348837209305

2126610,3,B0002VEWW4,I wasn't overly impressed with this documentary.  There was nothing terribly bad about it but it certainly doesn't get a WOW from me!,1396742400,2,133,4.782608695652174
2126611,3,B0002VEWW4,Very fast talking  Just average coverage. Decent pictures.  Have seen more interesting documentaries on him but it was worth watching,1396310400,2,133,5.6

Worth it!",1394496000,,131,4.28
2126614,3,B0002VEWW4,"This was an OK rental, but I wouldn't buy it.  There was nothing any fan didn't already know, and no new or unusual pictures.",1393545600,2,125,4.208333333333333

2126637,2,B0002VEWW4,It was very impersonal and didn't have the images to portray Elvis.  It was mostly a person narrating still pictures and where there were performances they did not show them long at all.  :/,1391904000,2,190,4.5588235294117645
2126638,4,B0002VEWW4,"It's an alright documentary about the humble beginnings of his life to his death. For the a devoted Elvis fan, there really isn't anything new when it comes to the footage and stories. I was still entertained and enjoyed the movie regardless.",1390521600,3,242,4.785714285714286

2126640,1,B0002VEWW4,This might be a good watch for the casual fan or someone who didn't know anything about EP. If you are a fan and followed his career this isn't the best thing to watch. I don't feel like it accurately reports how his career went.,1389398400,3,229,4.111111111111111
2126641,2,B0002VEWW4,i expected more music. i like his early music with the jordanaires. The documentary helped me to understand his performance style a little better. What a success he was.,1388966400,,169,4.862068965517241

2126643,2,B0002VEWW4,"This was a very low budget production and while factually correct was uninspiring. The film was mostly still pictures that have been posted to the internet and seen many times before. There was little new ground covered, few if any personal interviews and almost no film clips or performances shown. A few peers and interviews with stars that knew Elvis would have helped,
Sorry,but the low budget, lack luster script and limited dialog dragged the amazing story of the greatest super star of our time, down to mediocre. I doubt that anyone who had the opportunity to see Elvis or knew him would find this documentary impressive. The King deserves better.",1387670400,4,655,4.90990990990991

8033131,2,B0002VEWW4,I've seen far better films about Elvis.  This was just kind of a narrated biography that kind of skimmed the surface but never got deep enough to be interesting.  I found myself not really caring what the narrator had to say because I knew it would be just more basic facts and no depth.  I also believe that some of the information was incorrect--such as the assertion that Elvis never had sexual contact with Priscilla until after they were married.,1520035200,,451,4.6125
