8502221,4,B006OT0UQ0,"This is a compilation of 4 interviews with British experts on Freemasonry. Although it wasn't exactly what I expected, I enjoyed it. I'll rewatch for sure and it makes me want to read some of these author's books.",1362441600,,213,4.631578947368421
8502222,1,B006OT0UQ0,"I agree with Randy from Sandy. This is a dreadful and boring DVD and difficult to navigate. There is no film footage of any kind depicting either the Knights Templars or Masonic rituals. It is simply a series of very boring and non-revelatory lectures or dialogues from a TV show,with a know-nothing talk show host, telling you nothing that you didn't already know about Freemasonry. Two of the authors involved are really just hawking their books, so they are not about to tell you much of anything because they want you to buy their books. I wonder if even their books have anything much to say.",1337385600,,597,4.6415094339622645
8502223,1,B006OT0UQ0,"Don't be fooled by the flashy cover and nice graphics.  This is not a documentary!  It is nothing but a replay of four relatively boring and random interviews from a British talkshow (and not a very good one at that).  They interviewed three so called ""experts."" The second's ramblings were so scattered that it made little sense and had no final point.  They contradicted each other on the origins of freemasonry so you didn't know who to believe.  In spite of the flashy cover on the DVD there was no a single graphic or piece of footage referred to during the entire three hours.  The worst 3 hours and $16 I've spent.",1334793600,,621,4.5
