8098819,5,B00004I9P3,"This fascinating DVD features in-concert performances, conceptual video clips and animation blended together in a wonderful album with the hits Love Is A Stranger, Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This, I've Got An Angel and Who's That Girl. Their obscure first album In The Garden provides Never Gonna Cry Again and Take Me To Your Heart. Highlights found nowhere else in their recorded output include a Live performance of Lou Reed's Satellite Of Love and a catchy French song Tout Les Garcons Et Les Filles. The Love Is A Stranger video clip is particularly entrancing, showing Anne in a limousine removing a series of wigs to reveal radically different characters, culminating in an eerie bathroom suicide scene in spectral black and blue. An essential document from Eurythmics' prime, showcasing the full spectrum of their talent and flair.
