8053122,2,B0007X9TNY,"Not exactly what I expected. Troy is a great instructor when writing and producing his own lessons. But this video happens to fall short. The entire leads, rhythms, solos, and fills are compromised by showing only snippets of each song, leaving out many of the best parts of each song... I was most disappointed in him not covering the last solo in Bark At The Moon.  Again Troy is a GREAT instructor,teacher and phenomenal guitarist. I had the pleasure of going through his book ""Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar"" which is probably one of the best books out there on improving technique, speed and picking for rock/metal and guitarists of practically any genre. If your interested in learning the songs on this DVD and saving some money, I think your better off using Youtube, any online tab you can find and MOST importantly your ear.",1388707200,,835,4.758620689655173
8053123,5,B0007X9TNY,"A good instructional DVD to learn the 8 songs included. Notice that this is not a structured guitar method. Troy's one of the best instructors world wide.
Rhythm & lead guitars are shown played slowly (note-for-note) and at normal speed. Troy also breaks down the songs teaching the techniques used in every riff or solo. It includes full backing band tracks of every song to play along rhythm & lead parts.
There are songs from basic to intermediate/advanced level.
Song list:
- Bark At The Moon (Ozzy Osbourne)
- I Don't Believe In Love (Queensryche)
- Living After Midnight (Judas Priest)
- Paranoid (Black Sabbath)
- Round And Round (Ratt)
- Shock Me (Kiss)
- Smoke On The Water (Deep Purple)
- You Really Got Me (Van Halen)
Beginners can start with 'Living After Midnight' (very easy even the solo) and 'Paranoid'.
Two little complaints: Rhythm guitar is not taught in 'I Don't Believe in Love' and the end of the solo is missing in 'You Really Got Me' (at least in my copy. But not very important for me, that's why I keep 5 stars).",1184630400,9,1038,4.586021505376344
