8717406,5,B00Y1WPXOG,"This DVD set is of the original show, it does not have English subtitles, or voice overs. None the less, it fills a hole in the saga of one of Japan's children's series. Very well done, and with all new monsters, this set (region 4) does make for pleasant viewing. Too bad they did only a little English in the credits or the paperwork.",1466985600,2,336,4.265625
