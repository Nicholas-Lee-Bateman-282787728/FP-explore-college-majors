8160129,1,B000L42NSW,Don't waste your money!  I purchased this for my grandson....it was nothing but a very poor home video (it was even shaky).  We all walked away after a few minutes and threw it in the trash!  I wish they would have told me that it was a home movie.,1272240000,,248,4.020408163265306
8160130,2,B000L42NSW,"I was hoping to use the video as a career training tool for high school kids.  Unfortunately, it was more an amateur video from a mining site. There wasn't the variety of earth moving equipment that I anticipated, and the explosions didn't suit my purposes.",1175126400,4,257,4.711111111111111
