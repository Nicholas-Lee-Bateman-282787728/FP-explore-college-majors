8035142,1,B0002ZDPYG,"Anyone who is doing any kind of serious research into Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code should be aware of some important information that isn't revealed in 'Jesus, Mary, and Da Vinci'.  Mr. Brown's book, which he claims, in the preface, is based on 'fact' is actually perpetuating a known and established FRAUD with respect to its claims regarding the 'Priory of Sion' and the 'Dossier Secret' documents in the French National Libary.  It has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the 'Priory of Sion' and the 'Dossier Secret' documents are in fact the fraudulent creation of a circle of anti-semitic French nationalists who revolve around the figure of Pierre Plantard.  Mr. Plantard was a primary source for the authors of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' which Dan Brown attributes as one of his primary sources for the 'Da Vinci Code'.  This information has been brought to light in the excellent video 'Breaking the Da Vinci Code' as well as by CBS's 60 minutes, which filmed their own investigation into Mr. Brown's claims on a show that recently aired on April 30th.

Basically, Mr. Brown propagates the same fraudulent information that he inherits from his uncritical use of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail'.  Not very good form for someone who claims his fictional novel is based on 'fact'.  There are numerous other errors, misrepresentation, and outright fabrications in Mr. Brown's book that aren't adequately addressed in 'Jesus, Mary, and Da Vinci'.  Those who are truly interested in some solid, scholarly research on Mr. Brown's book would be well served by viewing the excellent video 'Breaking Da Vinci's Code' also available on Amazon.com.

There's nothing wrong with reading and understanding the 'Da Vinci Code' as a work of fiction, which it is, but don't confuse this book as a serious representation of history and theology, which it most certainly is not.",1146960000,9,1865,5.04885993485342
8035143,4,B0002ZDPYG,"I bought In Search for Jesus bacause it was advertised that it is hosted by Peter Jennings and also bought Jesus, Mary and Da Vinci for the same reason. Elizabeth Vargas actually hosted it. Though she delivered it very well, it is so disappointing for the fans of Peter Jennings to find out later that it was not him.  Anyways, I will add another star for the longer appearance of Dan Brown here compared to The Da Vinci Code Decoded where he only appeared in less than a minute, but was advertised as his DVD. Can I get my money back or some kind of discount for this error?",1115596800,5,575,4.275229357798165

Elizabeth Vargas does a good job of interviewing Dan Brown, Henry Lincoln, Catholic scholar Richard McBrien, evangelical scholar Darrell Bock, and pro-Gnostic Gospels scholars Karen King and Elaine Pagels.

The DVD is 55 minutes long and covers the following issues:

Was Jesus married to Mary Magdalene?

How important a leader was Mary Magdalene and how did the church portray her through the centuries?

What secret messages did Da Vinci try to convey through the painting of the Last Supper?

What is the relationship between the Holy Grail and Mary Magdalene?

What is the Priory of Sion?

Is there evidence of a Merovingian legacy of descendants?

Vargas does a good job of summarizing the basic arguments of the Da Vinci Code (e.g. Dan Brown);  I'm happy that she also interviewed scholars like Darrel Bock and Richard McBrien, who may disagree vehemently with the claims made by the novel, Da Vinci Code.  I'm also glad that at the end, Vargas mentions that there is no conclusive historical evidence which supports the claims made by the Da Vinci Code (esp. the Merovingian descendants from the supposed marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene.)

I really like this DVD because it brings out the issues brought out by the Da Vinci code in a simple and clear manner, it provides interviews with Dan Brown and notable scholars, and it gives you an visual image of the Last Supper painting and explains Dan Brown's arguments in his Da Vinci Code novel.

If you're fascinated with the Da Vinci Code, you will enjoy this documentary.  Even if you totally disagree with the claims made by the Da Vinci code, you would also benefit from it.  I find it very helpful for leading discussions for people who are interested in analyzing the claims made by the Da Vinci Code.

I like this documentary the best, among the several documentaries I've seen which talk about the Da Vinci Code.  I like it for its clear presentation, its fairly balanced treatment, and its organization of the subject matter.",1106006400,42,2139,4.797814207650274
