8425912,4,B000BT990C,"This movie explores characters dealing with their taboo motivations.

The movie touches on some of these questions:  Should a person be honest and frank, even when it is taboo?  When a person genuinely loves another human being, should the person let go of all other romantic or intimate entanglements?

This film flips a classic love triangle on its side, with complicated contradictions, to try to give the viewer an uncommon perspective on these ethical questions.

Without giving away the ending, one of the characters does an about face at the end of the movie, changing from kind to cruel (or is it cruel to kind? - guess it depends on your POV).  Does love still exist after that separation?  And if it does still exist, is it a healthy love?  Can a healthy love ever exist with complete and indefinite separation?  Or does the movie intend to ask the question:  What forces or concepts, good or bad, cause you to exclude others you care about?

I was distracted by the cinematography, and camera POVs, which was a shame, because I think the close proximity of the cameras distracted from the exceptional acting by all the cast (except for the pizza delivery guy of course).  But I can understand if the camera was intentionally ""too close"" because a point of the film may be that these type of characters are too close and they can quickly get in your face faster than you may want.

Patrick Belton is solid, believable at different extremes.  Mary Thornton is persuasive, capturing both kindness and ruthlessness.  Ronne Orenna is so good at singing in the film that it almost breaks the suspension of disbelief.  She reminds us how amazingly and multiply talented some human beings are.

It took courage for Pi Ware, Susan Kraker, and all the other creators to make this film.  I appreciate their work.",1143676800,6,1812,4.753205128205129
