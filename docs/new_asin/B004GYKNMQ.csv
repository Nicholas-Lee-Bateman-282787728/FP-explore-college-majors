8429101,1,B004GYKNMQ,This dvd is a complete hoax. It literally felt like some bad attempt by a new film student at making a documentary. For a Maroon 5 fan there is absolutely nothing of value in this product.,1402876800,4,188,4.25

8429103,1,B004GYKNMQ,"As a huge Maroon 5 fan, I got excited when I came across this DVD. I became a little suspicious when I couldn't find anything about it - not even the review that's quoted on the front of the case. I wish that I had listened to that little red flag in my head, because this is not a great DVD. It's not even much of a DVD.

There's nothing here that you don't already know or probably couldn't have found on YouTube. It's mostly comprised of video clips swiped from other sources, including the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wal-Mart-Soundcheck-Maroon-5/dp/B0010WW63Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wal*Mart Soundcheck Maroon 5</a>&nbsp;interview and paparazzi video, with the occasional interview of random people (I guess, as I didn't recognize them and there are no captions to explain who they are or why they're relevant). Then there's random still photography like a generic Los Angeles postcard. Most of the video has no relevance to the narration (like showing us Adam doing motion capture for his appearance in the video game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-Hero/dp/B0028ZNWWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band Hero</a>&nbsp;while talking about the pre-Maroon 5 years).

The titles bounce all over the screen and look incredibly cheesy. The narration is flat, like an automated phone recording, and it states the obvious...sometimes more than once. For example, near the beginning we hear about how the original four members of the band attended high school together. Then, 20 minutes later, the narrator tells us that all over again. It all reminded me of those slideshows that people used to put together in high school.

I give it one star because it was fun to watch some of the interview clips (like Adam and Jesse discussing their pre-Maroon 5 jobs). But a couple of minutes of footage here and there isn't worth slogging through the rest.
