""When the Wind Blows"" is a fun early short that features Jackie Cooper. Jackie has been skipping out on school and his lessons, so his father has to punish him. Wheezer thinks that is really funny, but manages to escape his brother's wrath. Later, Jackie overhears his parents talking about how proud of their son they are, if only he would study. It inspires him to retrieve his schoolbook which he earlier tossed out the window. However, when he slips outside, the window shuts tight, and a storm is brewing outside. He goes over to Farina's house, but Farina is scared stiff of the noises outside and proves to be no help. He goes to Wheezer's room, but Wheezer sicks Petey on him, who tears off the bottom of his nightgown. Jackie next tries his girlfriend Mary Ann, who is tittering over the idea of her boyfriend in her bedroom. All of this is going on while a robber is on the loose. Top it off with the incompetance of Edgar Kennedy, and you have a first class short on your hands.

""The Pooch"" is next. Stymie and Spanky are very hungry, so they start going door to door begging for food. Stymie doesn't want to seem like a beggar, so he tells the people that the food is for his dog. He is handed a hatful of dog biscuts which do him little good. Finally, he meets a lady who gives him lots of things to eat, but the mood is dampened when the dogcatcher comes and takes Pete away. He tells Stymie that unless he gets $5 by the end of the day, Petey will be killed. A frantic race against the clock ensues in an attempt to save his friend's life.

""Mush and Milk"" is a great little short. The gang lives in an orphanage and the head lady is a mean old witch. Her husband, though, is a sweet old man who vows to give the gang the world when he gets his back pension. In the meantime, he teaches the gang cute songs and little facts and generally makes their lives meaningful. A big part of this film revolves around getting milk from the dairy cow for breakfast. Pete steps in a spills all of it, and the cow has run dry. Stymie and Dickie solve the problem by mixing plaster of Paris and water.

""Framing Youth"" is another one of those cute show-business films. Spanky has set up a talent agency for his prize crooner Alfalfa. He plans to enter him in a radio talent contest and is sure his client will win first prize. That proves to be a problem when Butch decides to enter and plans to keep Alfalfa out of the race. Spanky does all he can to convince Alfalfa he is doomed, like putting a frog in his scarf and pretending not to be able to hear him.",1208649600,2,2673,4.2976190476190474
