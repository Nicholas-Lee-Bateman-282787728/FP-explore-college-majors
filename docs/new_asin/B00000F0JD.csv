1200685,5,B00000F0JD,"This movie was made close enough to the 80s when all the best action movies were made, and it shows. Brandon Lee fans don't have a large list of movies to choose from, so I was pleased to find out that in this movie he doesn't disappoint.  He shows a lot of his good natured personality and sense of humor in the film, which is great to see. There is some slapstick humor thrown in, and that takes some of the edge off of the sometimes violent action.  In the action department this movie rivals Showdown in Little Tokyo with gunplay, knife fighting, and physical fighting. There is a good amount of Brandon in the movie, so fan's of his will not want to miss this one. The film is not as slickly shot as Rapid Fire, but I woulndn't compare this film to that one, because they were made four years apart, and the action type movies were starting to change [around 1994], so I view this as kind of a 1980's style action movie (the film was made in 1990, so it just makes the cut). There's something about that style of movie that is still nice to see.",1058140800,25,1050,4.218905472636816
1200686,1,B00000F0JD,"This movie is a real dud. How Brandon Lee ever got involved with this ... is beyond me. No fight scenes and a dull, slow-moving plot.

1200687,1,B00000F0JD,"This is beyond question the worst movie ever created by a human being.  I have never seen anything that I consider to be more poorly done.  The entirety of the movie's budget seems to have been spent on casting Ernest Borgnine - which is fortunate, as none of the other ""actors"" are the least bit capable, except Brandon Lee, who clearly isn't even trying.  I've seen better cinematography from camcorders.  Also, the ""special"" effects are questionable at best, the chase scene has all the enthusiasm of a college student eating ramen noodles cooked a week prior, and at some point, they manage to get from Cuba to somewhere in Africa without ever telling the audience.  Furthermore, the female ""lead"" has a most amazing item: a isappearing-reappearing bra.  Though her clothing only comes off once (off camera), her bra, as near as we the viewer can tell, is present only every other scene.  It disgusts me that this movie was ever released, and the fact that it is now on DVD, where it will never biodegrade, makes me weep for humanity's future.
However.
This is by far the most ludicrously fun cinematic experience I have *ever* had, and I heartily endorse making unsuspecting fools watch this movie.  If you can stomach it.

It's a shame Brandon's talents were wasted in this CRAPPY film. The Director should find another job! Maybe directing cheesy porn. Who ever wrote the story should stop smoking crack while they write, the whole movie was just done bad! If I had the equipment I would have done a way better job half asleep!

1200690,2,B00000F0JD,"It's a classic 80's U.S. vs. U.S.S.R flick, unfortunately, it was made after the Soviet Union collapsed.  Beau Davis' poor selection of plot and sub-plot leave the viewer wondering not only the background of the characters, but the future of them as well.  Brandon Lee plays Michael Gold, a 007 wanna-be, whose luck with flying projectiles rivals only that of the Road Runner.  Granted, it is nice to see Lee in another movie besides his well known (The Crow and Rapid Fire), but one can easily see why this movie didn't captivate the audience.  His acting ability doesn't show at all, as if he simple walked through the set reading his lines off teleprompters.  Ernest Borgnine acting never seems to grow passed that of a childs, and Debi Monahan, whose more popular appearance being in 1991's Shattered with Tom Beringer, shows little talent when it comes to the silver screen, but weilds a gun and high heels as Lee's secretive partner.  My suggestion when it comes down to this movie, wait til it comes out on A.B.C. or N.B.C. or another TV station that costs you nothing to watch.  Rating TV...",977616000,2,1099,4.722513089005235

1200800,2,B00000F0JD,I hate to say this but if you are not collecting Brandon Lee films. Then you would have no reason to buy this dvd. This film's number one problem is that it cannot stand the test of time. The dialogue is so out dated and even worse are the action sequences. The fight scenes are nowhere close to The Crow or Rapid Fire. The storyline is bad and the acting is not good either. This is like any of the action television shows of the 1970's or early 1980's put on the big screen. The only thing I can tell you for sure.

If the scientists laser knowledge is crossed with the world biggest diamond it will create a, are you ready for this? Nuclear weapon. To do this mission Michael must teem up with the professors libeling daughter Alissa (Michael).

The only problem is that the CIA does not trust him.  The daughter turns to have an annoyingly negative attitude.

Is she for real as she can shoot, drive, and cross 40 miles of desert in high heals?

Is the professor what he seems as he seems chummy with the bad guys?

Is Sgt. Roberta (Maureen Lahoud) really a sergeant or a girl? In any case she is part of a Laurel and Hearty team.

1200805,1,B00000F0JD,"This is for the 2011 Elstree Hill version of this film. Forget about a review of the film - this is about the product. This version looks as bad as all the other cheapo versions of the film, but this one has bad audio. There is no audio in the left channel, and what is in the right channel is low volume.  Pure rubbish! At least earlier versions of the film don't have a sound problem.  I gave this release only one star, because amazon.com's system won't let you give it zero stars.

Now, let me get to the 2012 video on demand DVDr version of this film. The description and cover says it is released by a company called Blue Laser.  I was reluctant to order a DVDr of this because I really didn't believe it would be letterboxed, or any better than all the other junk versions of the film. I was very wrong.  It is truly letterboxed at 1:85. The picture is sharp, the colors are bright. If you have to own this b action flick, it is the one to have. To help you spot it, it has the title in green. The photo is a publicity shot of Brandon from Rapid Fire, and he is in a similar pose and wearing a sleeveless black t shirt. It is a DVDr, and it cost a little more than most versions of this film, but if you are a fan and you want this in your collection, this is the only version worth owning.

Remember, Blue Laser version, DVDr on demand, price around $12.  The Elstree version, Pickwick versions, Platinum versions and all the rest are pure crapola.

1200856,2,B00000F0JD,"Brandon Lee, Ernest Borgnine and Debi Monahan should have made this movie watchable.  About the only thing I found interesting in this movie was the exposure that Debi Monahan got in her dress.  The rest of the movie is a loosely connected series of action scenes that have almost nothing to do with a laser.  I was quite sad about not having a laser.

Michael Gold (Lee) is a super spy out to rescue Dr. Braun (Borgnine).  There is a lot of action and hitting and shooting and jumping, and the next thing you know there is this girl, Alissa (Monahan), who we all think is Dr. Braun's daughter.  Alissa seems to be quite handy with guns and explosives for someone who supposedly works in a zoo.

The next thing you know, we are in a desert and there is a big showdown and Gold gets shot in the back, and there are all kinds of blood on the front of his shirt, and yet Gold seems awfully spry.  There is still no laser at this point, but there is a big diamond (really big) that could be part of a laser if Dr. Braun is allowed to do his scientific laser thing.

In order to stay within the spirit of the movie, there is more shooting and blowing up, and it takes three attempts to take out the #1 bad guy.  Then there is a needless scene with a stolen helicopter and the movie is finally over.  There is STILL no laser.  I was so disappointed.  We have a movie called ""Laser Mission"" and there was never a laser.

I like a good action movie; it is just that this movie was not a good action movie.  I have to believe that the actors in this movie wish they could take this one back.  I know I would like to get back the time I wasted on this movie.  The only people who should consider getting this movie are those who have to have every Brandon Lee movie, or every appearance of Ernest Borgnine (which is past 200 television and movie appearances).  Everyone else should stay away; far away; really far away.

1200860,1,B00000F0JD,"BJ Davis ought to be ashamed of himself. I know he's usually a stunt coordinator and only moonlights as a director, but you'd think he'd have been able to do better when he had Brandon Lee at his disposal. Sure, this was before he achieved cult status with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow</a>, but geez, this was still the son of Bruce Lee, here! I'm not a hardcore fan, but it baffles me nonetheless how anybody could build a movie this disappointing around him. My guess is that Davis simply didn't know who Lee was during production and therefore treated him as just any other low-budget action hero. It's a shame that in his all-too-short filmography, Lee has to account for a stinker like this, but in hindsight, I guess it made his career well-rounded: every star needs at least one piece-of-garbage flick like this.

The story: CIA mercenary Michael Gould (Lee) is sent to convince a Cuban laser scientist (Ernest Borgnine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B0007TKNM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>) to join the American cause, but his quarry is intercepted by the KGB. Gould must team up with a mysterious agent (Debi Monahan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shattered/dp/B00008R9KN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shattered</a>) to rescue the man from the might of the KGB and Cuban army, headed by an iron-willed colonel (Graham Clarke,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Mutiny/dp/6302999472/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Mutiny</a>).

Randomly select any scene of this movie and argue that it's more exciting than watching paint dry. I dare you. ""Laser Mission"" has its share of action scenes, sure, but absolutely everything the movie tries to stage has the same grayish color scheme and the same trivial tone of unimportance. The dramatic bits feature acting that's not quite bad enough to make you laugh but instead comes off as that of your average high school production; even Oscar-winner Ernest Borgnine ends up looking like a complete amateur. All sense of style and flair gives way to what must have been a very frantic schedule to complete a decently-sized movie as soon as possible. It all feels very rushed. Very blah-some. Good luck trying to remember any character's name after sitting through this.

You'd think that you'd at least be able to watch a Brandon Lee movie for its fight scenes, but I'm afraid that all hand-to-hand content pales in abundance to the car chases and shootouts. In a 1993 issue, Black Belt Magazine wished to include the content of this movie in a list of the top ten worst martial arts offerings on film, but found that there was too little actual fighting to make a case for. Lee has about three hand-to-hand confrontations, but all of these not only feature completely forgettable choreography (an exception: Lee kicks a man onto a guillotine and then decapitates him) but also last only about twenty seconds on average.

Lee nevertheless manages to inject a bit of his snarky charm into his role and generates half a laugh when he dons a fake moustache and adopts a phony Hispanic accent to trick two hapless members of the Cuban military (no laughs are generated, however, when these two become the designated comic relief and keep popping up throughout the movie). Additionally, the Russian general is notable for being probably one of the most unbeatable villains ever (gunfire, explosions, and getting hit by a truck? - no problem!), but don't worry - nothing's out to save this louse of a movie. Production-wise, this one might be able to get away with a two-star rating, but if you keep in mind the quality of work Lee can deliver when utilized properly in stuff like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rapid-Fire/dp/B000065B08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rapid Fire</a>, this exercise in laziness deserves no recommendation whatsoever.",1290038400,,4104,5.767326732673268
1200861,4,B00000F0JD,"This was not my first time watching ""Laser Mission"", but believe me when I tell you that it's way more enjoyable with the commentary of Josh Way to distract you from the film than watching it in its original form. Although I enjoy riffing on movies, I miss the interaction between multiple commentators such as in ""MST3K"" or ""Cinematic Titanic;"" something of the magical formula is lost when it's essentially a monologue of funny lines versus an interactive conversation about the movie. Having said that, most of the lines from Josh Way are very entertaining (""Mortal Wombat!"") and are well placed. A favorite was when the Brandon Lee and Debi Monahan characters first become romantically inclined and Way laments (correctly, as it turns out) ""I think this movie is about to become exponentially more unpleasant."" The film itself is a dreadful and cheap ""adventure"" movie from 1990 starring the late Brandon Lee.

If you value the memory of Brandon Lee (and even if you don't) do yourself a favor and only consider watching ""Laser Mission"" for startling examples of extraordinary and unintentional comedy. The film opens with the monotonous and annoying power ballad ""Mercenary Man"" (the handiwork, I hate to reveal, of David Knopfler, Mark's younger brother) a song that fits the theme of the film, yet is played so often in the course of the movie that you will want to scream if you hear it one more time. The theme song is by far the best part of the movie.

The plot concerns Brandon Lee as Michael Gold, a mercenary US contract agent who travels to Cuba and then onward to some fictional country in Africa (though exactly how he gets there is a bit of a mystery.) This is all in an attempt to bring Ernest Borgnine (as Professor Braun) to the United States as he has developed a method of using a big diamond (which gets a subplot of it's own in an apparent homage to the original ""Pink Panther"") to make a laser that can start World War Three. Needless to say, Ernest (who has the worst accent in the history of cinema) is also wanted by the KGB led by the stiflingly bad Col. Kalishnakov (named for a similarly-named Soviet-manufactured combat weapon, evidently), and the amorphously evil ""Eckhardt"" who is menacing with his over-the-top pseudo-Austrian accent and diction skills. Think of William Shatner as an insane, evil member of the SS and you will come close to the degree of overacting present here.

The film boils down to some of the most ineptly directed combat scenes (it's always good to stand in the open when being shot at with a rifle; it is also wise to ignore the archer shooting huge arrows from about three feet above your head, but I digress) ever recorded for posterity. As a sidebar, we get the obligatory romance between Lee and Debi Monahan, an actress with a voice that can shatter glass at one hundred yards. She is supposed to be a super-spy of some sort (that's an issue open to conjecture as well) but spends the bulk of the film shrieking and running through the desert in a dress and heels. To say there is no chemistry between Lee and Monahan is to state the painfully obvious.

There are also plots about diamond mining, genocide, a team of comic-relief communist helicopter thieves, and a family reunion during an amazing turn of events in the last five minutes of the movie, which prepares us for one more round of ""Mercenary Man"" and the credits. Since the title of the film is ""Laser Mission"" it would be fair to assume that there was actually a laser in the movie. That's where you would be wrong: the laser is mentioned but never seen. Apparently it was cheaper to rent a helicopter, a small rocky outcropping in a third-world country, and a VW bus full of fake weaponry than to show a laser.

As a special bonus the DVD also includes a wonderful short called ""Bus Nut"" funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. It features a school girl who has big dreams of becoming a school bus driver, and has some amazing stunt sequences. I actually found ""Bus Nut"" incredibly hilarious, and wondered how on Earth this thing got funded, then remembered the government paid for it. The commentary on ""Bus Nut"" is superb (""Tun Sub!"") and required several viewings.

Overall I look forward to more of the ""Fun With Flicks"" DVDs, and recommend this to lovers of bad cinema anywhere.",1263340800,3,4331,4.684625492772668

Ernest Borgnine obviously needs the work and who could blame him.

Essentially, this is another twist on the cold war with both sides after a huge diamond for a laser which you must have faith to believe exists as you nevere get to see it. Bit like the Holy Grail really.

1200864,4,B00000F0JD,"Bad acting, crappy dialog, guns, explosions, men on fire, etc., etc., etc. All staples of a low budget action flick. Despite all of this, I always have fun watching ""Laser Mission"" (sometimes called ""Soldier of Fortune"") which stars Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee). Brandon plays Michael Gold, a mercenary hired to persuade a Dr. Braun (Ernest Borgnine) to defect to the U.S. and then must rescue the Dr. from the clutches of the KGB. Gold must team up with the professors ""daughter"" (Debi Monahan), cross a desert, dogde bullets, and fight the bad guys. A very fun and unintentionally funny film.

""The Real Bruce Lee"" is a documentary about, who else, Bruce Lee (Brandon's daddy). The first half hour contains some clip from the very first four movies Bruce acted in (Kid Cheung, Bad Boy, The Carnival and Orphan Sam). The picture quality of these clips is not that great (sepia toned and grainy), but it is very interesting to see young Bruce on film (one clip even has Bruce and his father in the same scene). The rest of the film contains a highlight reel of Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Li and then a film starring another imitator called Dragon Lee. This is an interesting documentary, but more about Bruce and less about his copy-cats would have been nice.

The picture quality on this double feature is not that great. The edges of the films are cut off and there seems to be a fuzz over the picture. What can you expect from a cheap double feature? I give this DVD a four star rating because, like I said, I have fun watching ""Laser Mission"" and find the documentary interesting. Plus I only had to pay a dollar for over three hours of entertainment.

1200918,2,B00000F0JD,"Given the tragic circumstances of his untimely death, not to mention the deep respect I have for his father, I feel sort of bad about denigrating one of Brandon Lee's films (albeit, one of his earliest films).  Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that Laser Mission exists solely to be made fun of, as it's such a hilariously bad movie.  The plot barely holds the whole thing together, the acting is pretty weak all across the board, the dialogue is so cheesy that that the film should come with a warning label for lactose-intolerant viewers, the special effects don't exactly blow you away, and even the music proves to be highly annoying.  Obviously, I really have no choice but to give the film a low rating, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the heck out of watching it - this thing is chock full of unintentional hilarity.

Brandon Lee plays Michael Gold, a secret agent-type guy who really isn't very good at his job.  Apparently, all of the CIA's spies were at a meeting or something because the Americans hire Gold to go down and try to talk a Cuban scientist (played by ""well-known Cuban actor"" Ernest Borgnine) into bringing his knowledge of advanced laser technology to America.  Gold screws that up pretty quickly but manages to beg his way into a second chance with the guys at the American Embassy.  With Professor Braun (Borgnine) now missing, Gold seeks out help from the professor's daughter Alissa (Debi Monahan, who's about as Cuban as Marilyn Monroe) - and I must say that the disguised manner in which he first contacts her is not to be missed (nor is the somewhat revealing dress Monahan wears throughout most of the movie - without it, there would be absolutely nothing worth looking at in the entire film).  Even the setting of this film is problematic.  It seems pretty clear that the whole thing begins in Cuba, so I was pretty confused when Gold starts talking about heading south for the border (the last I checked, Cuba was an island).  The next thing I knew, he and Alissa are in Africa (and still driving the same beat-up VW van they escaped in).  That pretty much sums this whole movie up in a nutshell (that and the fact that the word ""titles"" is misspelled in the closing credits).

In closing, I thought I would just jot down a few of the things I learned from watching Laser Mission:
* Anyone can pass as a Cuban, even without a fake mustache (and it's OK if you forget your accent every now and again).
* It is not altogether shocking for high-ranking officers in the Cuban army to drop out of trees and start barking orders in English to bivouacking soldiers.
* No one at any level of the Cuban army can hit a target, so you have plenty of time to walk toward them and make sure your aim is perfect before killing any of them - actually, you don't even have to aim at them if you don't want to.  Brandon Lee shot up a truckload of Cuban soldiers with his gun pretty much pointed toward the ground.
* You can apparently drive from Cuba to the African desert in just a few hours.
* It's possible to walk across 400 miles of desert in high heels, without any water to drink, and come out looking only moderately sweaty - and your clothes won't be dirty no matter how many sand dunes you roll down while fighting incompetent assassins.
* All you need to make a nuclear bomb is the right kind of laser and a big honkin' diamond.",1211932800,4,3370,4.460162601626016

What we have here if a failure of a movie. It's hard to watch Lee go through this movie not giving anything. That's what I felt like when he did Showdown In Little Tokyo which is way worse then this. Borgnine has a bad awful accent. Graham Clarke (Running Free, Ali) was worse as the Colonel. I mean how many times did he like get in a fatal situation and wind up coming back? He got shot. He got burned and then they ran him over. Geez. This is no James Bond or...or James Bond Jr. for all that it's worth. The action scenes weren't that great.

1200924,2,B00000F0JD,"If you value the memory of Brandon Lee (and even if you don't) do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. I give it two stars overall, but the second star is for extraordinary and unintentional comedy. The film opens with the monotonous and annoying power ballad ""Mercenary Man"" (the handiwork, I hate to reveal, of David Knopfler, Mark's younger brother) a song that fits the theme of the film, yet is played so often in the course of the movie that you will want to scream if you hear it one more time. Unfortunately for the viewer, the theme song is by far the best part of the movie.

The plot concerns Brandon Lee as Michael Gold, a mercenary US contract agent who travels to Cuba and then onward to some fictional country in Africa (though exactly how he gets there is a bit of a mystery.) This is all in an attempt to bring Ernest Borgnine (as Professor Braun) to the United States as he has developed a method of using a big diamond (which gets a subplot of it's own in an apparent homage to the original ""Pink Panther"") to make a laser that can start World War Three. Needless to say, Ernest (who has the worst accent in the history of cinema) is also wanted by the KGB led by the stiflingly bad Col. Kalishnakov (named for a similarly-named Soviet-manufactured combat weapon, evidently), and the amorphously evil ""Eckhardt"" who is menacing with his over-the-top pseudo-Austrian accent and diction skills. Think of William Shatner as an insane, evil member of the SS and you will come close to the degree of overacting present here.

The film boils down to some of the most ineptly directed combat scenes (it's always good to stand in the open when being shot at with a rifle; it is also wise to ignore the archer shooting huge arrows from about three feet above your head, but I digress) ever recorded for posterity. As a sidebar, we get the obligatory romance between Lee and Debi Monahan, an actress with a voice that can shatter glass at one hundred yards. She is supposed to be a super-spy of some sort (that's an issue open to conjecture as well) but spends the bulk of the film shrieking and running through the desert in a dress and heels. To say there is no chemistry between Lee and Monahan is to state the painfully obvious.

There are also plots about diamond mining, genocide, a team of comic-relief communist helicopter thieves, and a family reunion during an amazing turn of events in the last five minutes of the movie, which prepares us for one more round of ""Mercenary Man"" and the credits.

This film really would have been excellent fodder for MST3K or Joe Bob Briggs. As a final note, since the title of the film is ""Laser Mission"" it would be fair to assume that there was actually a laser in the movie. That's where you would be wrong: the laser is mentioned but never seen. Apparently it was cheaper to rent a helicopter, a small rocky outcropping in a third-world country, and a VW bus full of fake weaponry than to show a laser. The lack of a laser in the film despite the implicit promise of a laser in the title contributes to the second star I give this film.",1141948800,17,3102,4.475265017667844
1200925,2,B00000F0JD,"Brandon Lee, Ernest Borgnine and Debi Monahan should have made this movie watchable.  About the only thing I found interesting in this movie was the exposure that Debi Monahan got in her dress.  The rest of the movie is a loosely connected series of action scenes that have almost nothing to do with a laser.  I was quite sad about not having a laser.

Michael Gold (Lee) is a super spy out to rescue Dr. Braun (Borgnine).  There is a lot of action and hitting and shooting and jumping, and the next thing you know there is this girl, Alissa (Monahan), who we all think is Dr. Braun's daughter.  Alissa seems to be quite handy with guns and explosives for someone who supposedly works in a zoo.

The next thing you know, we are in a desert and there is a big showdown and Gold gets shot in the back, and there are all kinds of blood on the front of his shirt, and yet Gold seems awfully spry.  There is still no laser at this point, but there is a big diamond (really big) that could be part of a laser if Dr. Braun is allowed to do his scientific thing.

In order to stay within the spirit of the movie, there is more shooting and blowing up, and it takes three attempts to take out the #1 bad guy.  Then there is a needless scene with a stolen helicopter and the movie is finally over.  There is STILL no laser.  I was so disappointed.  We have a movie called ""Laser Mission"" and there was never a laser.

I like a good action movie; it is just that this movie was not a good action movie.  I have to believe that the actors in this movie wish they could take this one back.  I know I would like to get back the time I wasted on this movie.  The only people who should consider getting this movie are those who have to have every Brandon Lee movie, or every appearance of Ernest Borgnine (which is approaching 200 television and movie appearances).  Everyone else should stay away; far away; really far away.",1138665600,4,1910,4.2292817679558015

Tragically killed while filming THE CROW, Lee was a handsome fellow indeed and he seemed to be acquiring a knack for injecting humor into his offhand delivery.  But LASER MISSION is so poorly written, directed and acted, it only serves as a tribute to a young man who was heading for better things.  Debi Monahan as the love interest is pouty, unconvincing and in need of acting lessons; even venerable Ernest Borgnine can't rescue this dumb, over the top actioner.

Gold and Alissa secure a VW hippie-van loaded with guns and explosives, and tear around shooting and blowing up stuntmen until being blown up themselves (the van that is). Most of the action takes place in the desert, where austrian thugs come at our heroes one at a time, seemingly from nowhere, on foot and on horseback! The whole thing culminates in a sub-par climax at a diamond mine. Watch as Gold is shot in the back, a through-and-through wound that most certainly mulches his liver!
