8345383,5,B001UXTJ0I,First five seasons of Two and a Half Men are down-right hilarious.  I loved Cryer's character before they basically reduced him to a grovelling leech in future seasons.,1389484800,,168,5.0
8345384,5,B001UXTJ0I,"OK.. first of all I was not a fan of the show, I thought it is ""ok"" but my wife loves it!
I got this set and yeah I am getting hooked on it!

The sets are in order (Duh) but what is nice you can hit ""Play all"" and just let them go.

Fan of the show? get it! No commercials, you can play them all at once and kick back.. what more do you want?

If you are like me? well ok.. I like the show now :)

8345385,1,B001UXTJ0I,"Great show, but every single disc for season four freezes up.  It also appears to have been copied from the television broadcast.  There's a brief spot after some episodes where the next show is announced.  Lots of money to spend on crappy quality.  And I got it as a gift for my spouse.",1255737600,,287,4.3584905660377355
8345386,5,B001UXTJ0I,Great set. However season 1 disc 1 freezes during one episode. We have not watched the other seasons to see if there is a problem with those discs. Recommend to everyone!,1252713600,,170,4.516129032258065
8345387,5,B001UXTJ0I,"I love this show and have all six seasons on dvd.  The actors are amazing.  But then who hasn't watched Charlie Sheen from the 80's on?  The talent of Jon Cryer probably isn't talked about enough--he can do slapstick, deliver the straight lines, perform all sorts of antics and do it week after week.  Angus T Jones is just amazing.  No wonder this show is number one and has been for 6 years.  Great show.",1252713600,,406,4.346666666666667
8345388,5,B001UXTJ0I,"I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday...he and I can't tear ourselves away from the TV, we love it!  You won't regret this purchase.",1250467200,,136,4.666666666666667
8345389,5,B001UXTJ0I,"This was voted 'Best Father's Day Gift Ever' at our house. We've never laughed so much at any other show. Awesome.
I was a little disappointed to find that the Season Three episode insert was missing though. Those will be handy when we are ready to view some of them again...and we will. Looking forward to season six.",1247616000,,318,4.5
8345390,5,B001UXTJ0I,I receive Two and Half Men seasons 1-5 on the day that the items are suppose to be arriving. Great packaging and nothing is damage.,1247529600,,131,4.28
