A transporting experience. Bravo!",1497484800,,115,6.25
8733624,2,B015HNXSIA,"74 minutes of endlessly complex, creative choreography.  10 minutes of minimalist music repeated over and over and over and over... If you are a fan of minimalist music you might love this.  Otherwise, enjoy for the dance which is quite wonderful.  If the dance isn't good enough to compensate for the incessant, brain numbing, percussive pounding of the music, you might be better to pass on this!",1481932800,,398,4.91044776119403

8733626,1,B015HNXSIA,"I took a chance since I did not like the music, but good dance can save or work with poor music.  Not here.  There was lots of running around the stage, literally, like a track meet.  A few brief moments of nice dance did not make this worthwhile.  What a waste of the resources of the POB.",1457222400,2,290,4.035087719298246
8733627,5,B015HNXSIA,"In 2001 choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and her troupe Rosas had a big hit with her production of Rain, based on Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians from 1976. Ten years later the work made its way into the repertoire of the Ballet of the Paris Opera, and this amazing Blu-ray is the result. The music is a complex, large-scale work that lasts 75 minutes, and de Keersmaeker runs her 10 dancers - 7 women and 3 men - pretty much without a break. Its like a movie filmed in a single take. The dancing is every bit as complex as the music, with the group breaking down into individual dancers, pairs, triplets, every combination.  Bojana Cveji termed it polyphonic excess. I imagine watching the live ballet from the gorgeous Palais Garnier: the shifting geometries of dancers matching the repeating cycles of the music. Theres some added value in seeing it on the Blu-ray, with the cameras focussing on particular individuals and combinations as they interact. This is impressive film direction. The sum (or rather product) of these combinations takes us from seeing a group of 10 generic dancers to, by the end, 10 individual, recognizable human beings. The 18 (actually more) Musicians play a combination of strings, pianos and percussion instruments, with important parts for the clarinet, bass clarinet and female voices. Its the quality and span of the human breath that provides structure - pulses and oscillations - to the music, and a more human quality to a machine-like structure. The human addition to these complexities from the dance side helps us better understand both Reichs and de Keersmaekers abundant vision.",1452556800,5,1635,4.967153284671533
8733628,4,B015HNXSIA,"This is a very entertaining treatment of a Steve Reich classic work, his ""Music for Eighteen Musicians"", from 1976. This video of the 2014 performance is choreographed by Belgian Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and performed by members of the Paris Opera Ballet with the Ensemble Ictus and the Synergy Vocals ensemble. The bluray sight and sound here is very good although, truth be told, this is not what to go buy if you just want a sonically captivating recording of the music itself. The choreography and dance perform here is modern, of course, but not abstract. de Keersmaeker's vision uses the exuberance and space within the score to create a very upbeat and rhythmic vision; literally a 'reaction' in dance to the very non-linear and non-programmatic aspects of Reich's music. I am no dance authority but I have seen many productions and I do admire the verve and the skill of the dancers and think that what they have created here is a very nice and very appropriate symbiosis with the score. The music does somewhat 'rain' in places as the minimal classic builds upon itself and the visual aspect seems in perfect with the building textures and shifting harmonies. I enjoyed this for the very clean audio and video and a new 'look' at Steve Reich's score; already very familiar. I think that those familiar with modern dance would also like this a great deal!",1450828800,6,1365,4.788135593220339
