8176372,1,B000NA77ZI,"Waited quite a while to get a copy of this movie. Was utterly disappointed when I finally played it and found that appears to be a pirated copy. The video quality is below 8mm home movies. The resolution is 640x480,aspect ratio 2.31:1. If you like the classic old movies don't buy this from this seller it's a rip off!!!! Gave it 1 star because there were no negative ratings!!!  [....]",1313625600,,386,4.514285714285714

8176374,4,B000NA77ZI,"I saw this movie in my youth when I was enamored of all things Egyptian.  I thought it enthralling at the time, and today I am still satisfied.  The sets are marvelously accurate and a visual treat.  Probably the casting director should have been fired.  Jack Hawkins as a hoarse-voice, pigeon-toed ox of a pharoah doesn't ring true, and Joan Collins sucking in her abs as she vamps and slithers her way around the sets is especially humorous given her roles in the intervening years; however, don't ask me why, but it all works.  Possibly it works because Howard Hawks (Howard Hawks!) was the director, and William Faulkner (William Faulkner!) was one of the writers.  At any rate, it's a campy classic that still holds my interest.",1199232000,3,733,4.732283464566929
