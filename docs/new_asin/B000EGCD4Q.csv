2517502,4,B000EGCD4Q,"This movie fits in the category of ""I didn't expect much from it but it turn out to be decent because I didn't expect much."" It kind of reminds me of a lifetime movie. It might be one to tell you the truth.

Now to the movie. What I liked about it is that it is a story about a boy who has very crappy parents. It shows his journey in the foster care system and how the current system sometimes fails kids. It really is about our current philosophy that family unification is the best option in regards to when families have problems such as parents abusing and neglecting their kids. It shows an example of why that philosophy is not always the best option.

I've worked with many kids in a group home setting in which I knew they shouldnt go back to their parents however the system 95% of the time always sent them back to fail and experience more devestation filled with more false hope and physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse. My question is: How many chances should a parent get to be a parent at the expense of their children? This movie shows how helpless a child is in the system.

I remember when I was a child and people use to tell me that childhood is the best time of your life. Well this movie displays my way of thinking about that issue. Childhood is only as good as the parents you were given.

So basically this is a good movie if you like lifetime types of flixs. I enjoyed it.",1222041600,2,1401,4.235955056179775
2517503,4,B000EGCD4Q,This film is based on a true story about a 12 year old boy who made history.  He filed for divorce from his family.  We follow his heart wrenching story through court proceedings as he is torn between the love he has for his alcoholic mother and his real need to seperate himself from his toxic parents.  His fight to be legally adopted by his foster parents was ground breaking and this movie does a very good job of telling his sad story.,1178236800,,440,4.27710843373494

8109001,5,B000EGCD4Q,I watched this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. Also I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt very much. This movie is about a young boy that has been displaced by his original parents and has been wanting adoption into his new family. There were many legal issues to surmount but he finally got his wish at the end of the movie. Custody was granted to a new family. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can be seen in an earlier movie called Holy Matrimonial. With his acting abilities he also has a talent for comedy. His very latest movie is called Mysterious Skin. I believe this is an R rated movie so preview it before letting anyone under 16 view it. Maybe this movie will one day be available for video streaming on Amazon. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a very beautiful boy.,1421452800,,748,4.58955223880597
8109002,3,B000EGCD4Q,"I bought this DVD as a long-time fan of Mr. Gordon-Levitt. This is what it is, a very beginning example of his work.  As a social worker who dealt with the social service system over a 50 year period, I found the story heart-breathtakingly true.  The ""rescue"" family was almost too good to be true.  The whole situation was almost too good to be true.  Readers should realize that many abused and neglected children and youth found good homes to live in with adoptive families of limited means but great love.  Many told me how those parents saved their lives.

Adoption of American children is still needed today, especially, of older children and teens.  It's never too late for them to join a caring family.",1388620800,,710,4.632
8109003,5,B000EGCD4Q,I really loved this movie very well worth the price it talked alot about real life situations that occur in everyday life would highly recommend this movie,1353369600,,155,4.777777777777778

8109005,4,B000EGCD4Q,""" I originally bougth this DVD first because it was a true story but most important because I have bought previously DVD's made by Direct Source Label and was amazed.

Even tough the story was nice and true I don't gave the five star because I feel that I need a little bit more drama and to be more explicit in some aspects in order to cause the viewer to be shocked and learn.

Over all it is a good movie.""",1232236800,,409,4.037037037037037
