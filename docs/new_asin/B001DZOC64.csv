3543801,2,B001DZOC64,"The acting is good.  The cinematography is good.  The plot, however, is unbelievable:  stranded twenty-somethings break into Rusty Nails' home and ""borrow"" his car.  They leave a note with their phone number and advise that--as soon as possible--they will return the car and pay for all damage to Rusty's home.

Rusty arrives home and, finding his car missing and home broken into, stalks the teenagers; he kidnaps one of the males (main character's boyfriend). The main character is asked to cut off her sister's finger [because she flipped Rusty ""the bird""] and offer it to Rusty to get reunited with her boyfriend.  The plot gets worse as Rusty asks the characters to perform ding-a-ling tasks [the main character has to strip to her underwear in the headlight beams of Rusty's truck; male character has to dress as a prostitute and parade in front of truckers].  Although these tasks are based on plot points, I lost empathy for the characters [and whether or not they survived] as they continued to perform brainlessly for Rusty in hopes of being reunited with the main character's boyfriend.

Chopping off your sister's finger, stripping off your clothes in the glow of a Mack truck's headlights, and parading yourself in drag before a seemingly hostile group of truckers [intent on partying and drag racing]..well...it's just silly.

The first Joy Ride was very well done and this sequel is as banal as it is insipid.

3543802,3,B001DZOC64,"In the original, the entire movie was centered around three friends, Paul Walker, Lele Sorbeski and the other guy and their relationship, with a killer chasing them. This movie was more  Rusty-Nil, the killer, centered.
The two sisters were  well-cast, but the two boyfriends were miscast. There was two much ""attempting"" and not enough accomplishing. Everything was too obvious- the prolonged torture, mental games, predictable murders etc, etc. This substituted for getting to know the four main protagonists, a common mistake in horror sequals. We also learned nothing new about Rusty-Nail. I bought this movie, sight-unseen because of how good the original was. This movie disappointed me. The ending left an opening for a third installment. I hope, if their is, they will improve upon this sequal. REnt. Do not buy.",1223856000,,820,5.251908396946565
3543803,4,B001DZOC64,"Joy Ride 2 wasn't that bad, having said that it wasn't has good has the first one. It would have been better if they had the Original Rusty Nail in it. This one has alot more gore and murder in it. They left it open for a third movie but, theres only so much they can do with the story before it gets old. If you liked the first one you should at least see part 2. GRADE C+",1223596800,2,373,3.7341772151898733
3543804,2,B001DZOC64,"There were too many things wrong with this movie to make it worth while.  Joy Ride 1 had most everything this movie had and more and was not such an insult your common sense or the laws of physics not to mention at least several scenes that were so rushed you'd think you hit the Fast FWD by accident.

You're better watching the first one over again instead.  The end was just barely acceptable and I won't spoil the very end , the producers screwed that up for you too.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because I rounded up from 1.5 and it just entertaining enough not to fall asleep.  Save your money, wait for it to come out on TV.

3543806,4,B001DZOC64,For a straight to dvd sequel the movie itself was good. Had some good gore scenes also. Worth having if you own the 1st Joy Ride.,1223337600,2,129,4.0
3543807,3,B001DZOC64,"Joy Ride 2 lacks the tension and fright found in the first movie but it still manages to entertain unlike so many horror movies that go direct to DVD.

Rusty Nails, the trucker who happens to be a serial killer, continues with the carnage when he discovers that two couples broke into his home and stole his vintage sports car, after their car broke down. Rusty doesn't take too kindly to folks stealing his property. He quickly teaches them a lesson in manners that they'll soon take to their graves.

In this movie, you get to see some profile shots of Rusty's face. Surprisingly, he isn't the fat trucker I thought he was. He has more of a Triple-H, a la wrestler, build and facial appearance. At least that's what I saw, but you may think otherwise.

I thought the killings and torture scenes were effective but not original. After all, there's only so many ways you can maim or murder somebody and in horror, it's pretty much been done.

It's a good sequel that tries to remain faithful to the Rusty mystique and pulls it off for the most part. In the end, I enjoyed it and I think you will, too.",1222387200,27,1101,4.4088669950738915

3543901,5,B001DZOC64,"I love  categorizing horror into sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. For instance, I'd say that slasher is an important genre of horror, and that one of its best sub-genres is what I'd call the Southwestern road slasher. Off the top of my head I can think of Hills Have Eyes, Curse 2, Vacancy, No Vacancy, Rest Stop, and Joy Ride. For some reason, I tend to like these movies a lot.
About two thirds of the way through the movie I stopped comparing it to the first. They're two different creatures. The first took a rare amount of time to get us acquainted with the main characters and it really paid off. This film didn't take that luxury, and that was okay. Of the four characters, two remain pretty much sketchy and two get more fleshed out, but this film doesn't rely on the protagonists in the way the last one did. It relies on the villain, Rusty Nail, and it does exactly what it should, focusing on his brutality and mercilessness, letting us get closer to him without making any attempts to give him an origin story of just what got him so messed up. Not that such as thing necessarily ruins a franchise; Wrong Turn 4 was excellent; but as Stan Lee well knew, you want to take extra care delineating the history of a villain.",1417564800,3,1229,4.438053097345133

Midway, I fast-forwarded to the last 10 minutes

For me, the show is predictable and reminds me of Spielberg's 71 ""Duel""
Not so much story line but the mood and treatment
Plot-wise ""Duel"" had a menacing feel to it
We never know why the crazy guy did what he did

Whereas this one, the 4 brats were kind of dumb and asked for it

When Mel went into the morgue, why didn't she use the phone?
And if she wanted to convince the tracker she had obeyed him (not saying what he asked her to do so as not to spoil the show), would she have shown both her hands?

Unfortunately for them, they have just borrowed the car of a crazed killer that stalks them in his giant semi as they head back out onto the highway. It's another twisted game of cat-and-mouse in JOY RIDE 2, only this time, the stakes are stupider than ever! What a misleading title. Rusty Nail returns to torture a new batch of twenty-somethings using childish pranks to match the absurd plotting, but thankfully, there is enough bloodshed along the way to keep us mildly entertained. Watch in horror as one of the characters strips to her panties! Reel in terror as another of the guys has to dress like a prostitute at a local truck stop! Puke in madness at the tired Horror tropes and dated pop culture references! Between the irritating characters and their mindless chatter, it is often difficult to stay awake, but for the precious little nuggets of gore that occasionally make their way to the screen. JOY RIDE 2 should be one of your last stops on the highway of horror.

It didn't help that I watched both films back to back and could make the obvious comparisons.  With the sequel, their first mistake was in trying to keep the same elements, same combinations, similar gimmicks.  Their second mistake was in making Rusty positively chatty this time out (different voice, dopey chuckle, it didn't inspire terror it made me laugh).  Their third mistake was adopting the torture aspect prevalent in most horror films these days, reducing Rusty to just another run of the mill serial killer.

3543951,3,B001DZOC64,"While the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Ride/dp/B0002WT4OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Ride</a>"" was a classy, suspenseful and stylish film, its direct-to-DVD sequel, ""Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead,"" goes more for the gore and cheap thrills, playing as sort of a cross between the first film and films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>"" which derive much of their horror from placing their characters in excruciatingly uncomfortable situations.

In the original film, we had characters we cared about, who found themselves at odds with an unstable trucker known only by the handle Rusty Nail after a seemingly innocent prank. Here, the characters -- as cardboard as you would expect from a cash-in sequel -- seem to be making as many poor decisions as they can at every turn and are just begging to be a part of Rusty's game. Rusty himself, who has been re-cast from Ted Levine to Mark Gibbon, comes across less-human than before and seems to have an even meaner streak. Here, the attempt is made to cast Rusty Nail as some sort of franchise villain, worthy of carrying future films on his back, but unfortunately, the film adds nothing new to the character's mythology or motivations. He's just a mean guy who can't be reasoned with.

In spite of its flaws and the fact that it can't hold a candle to the original, ""Dead Ahead"" gets a pass for delivering some decent thrills and for attempting to milk some tension in its final act. Also, the actors seem to be trying to deliver more than just the stereotypes they were written as, and for that, they should be commended. For the most part, it works, and to be honest, there have been much, much worse direct-to-DVD sequels in recent memory. It's also a bit tough to follow-up such a strong act as the first, so with that in mind, you'll be able to turn off your brain and enjoy a ride with ""Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead.""",1300492800,,2018,5.206153846153846

3543953,3,B001DZOC64,"Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead (2008) the sequel to Joy Ride (2001), follows the further adventures of Rusty Nail (Mark Gibbon), the homicidal trucker who believes in administering his own unique brand of sadistic justice.  Once again, someone has committed an affront, and ticked him off, and now there will be hell to pay.

On their way to Vegas to get hitched, Melissa (Nicki Aycox) and her fianc Bobby (Nick Zano), are joined by Melissa's sister Kayla (Laura Jordan), and her new boyfriend Nik (Kyle Schmid), when their car dies in the middle of nowhere.  The group break into an empty house, and ""borrow"" a car.  Unfortunately the vehicle belongs to Rusty Nail, and he strikes quickly, abducting Bobby at truck stop and holding him a captive on the floor of his truck.  The group is then forced to do whatever Rusty says, to get him back.  The trucker has an uncanny ability to anticipate what his prey may do.  Guided by a macabre sense of humor, he enjoys tormenting and humiliating his victims, until he decides it is time for them to die.

Joy Ride 2 lacks the charm, warmth and innocence, of the original Joy RIde, which developed a special relationship among the victims, before Rusty Nail began his quest for revenge.  You still don't get a clear look at Rusty, and a different actor is doing his voice, but he still has a thing for CB radio, and his CB handle is the only way he is identified.  In the first film, Rusty was the victim of a cruel prank, who in the heat of the moment, might have been pushed too far.  In the sequel, it is clear that the man is a sadistic psycho, with a history of deranged, violent behavior.  Darker and more mean spirited, matters escalate to a wild unrealistic finish in the desert, that leaves the door open to Rusty Nail's return.",1275177600,,1772,4.503125

3543956,1,B001DZOC64,"It's been almost a year since I wrote my last movie review. I just sort of lost the motivation. It would take a movie so bad that I would have no choice but to castigate all involved in said film, and it's Joy Ride 2 that has this dubious honor.

Story: Four idiots break down on the road, they break into a house, steal a car, after which the psychotic owner kidnaps one of them, and the rest of the movie is based on them trying to recover their friend.

Although I've seen plenty of bad movies in the past year, I'm not sure if any one of those had the combination of being this flagrantly bad in terms of BOTH acting and writing. Usually it's a combination of both, where one aspect might be pretty bad, while the other only makes you want to kill yourself just a little bit. This pile of trash is literally at the lowest end of the scale for both acting and writing, and here are some reasons:

**As a bad writing example, the fact that the main girl left her number for the owner after they stole the car. If anything, she should've left a note saying they'd return the car as soon as they could, and apologize. Since this is basically the catalyst to jumpstart the movie, I'll let this pass.

**Bad acting by the main girl after she runs into the parking lot after learning her boyfriend is kidnapped. In general, her dialogue and emotion didn't fit- at times where she should've been panicked and desperate, she comes across sounding angry, wrong choice. By the way, when her cell phone rang in this scene, why did she answer ""Bobby are you OK?"" as if there were any chance that it would even BE Bobby on the other line? She just got done talking to the kidnapper, why is she assuming it's her boyfriend that would be calling?

**I don't see how that emo dude should've so confidently talked trash about truckers in a diner FULL OF THEM. Also, I thought it was unrealistic how the two girlfriends were sort of going along with the emo dude's insults about the truckers, just smiling. It came across like they genuinely thought it was funny, most girls would've told him to shut up and get his act together.

**In that strip tease scene, when she approached the truck assuming that Rusty Nails was behind the wheel, when the decoy shows his face, her reaction is just..all wrong. Yes, WE as the audience are taken by surprise that it's not the actual kidnapper and instead it's some hillbilly retard, but HOW DOES SHE KNOW?? Why did she immediately come to the conclusion that they'd been tricked and he wasn't the actual kidnapper? And the way she screamed ""Bobby"" was worse than Darth Vader's ""noooooo.""

**The scene I hated most was when the emo dude was chosen to dress up in a wig and dress, and the way the main girl went into movie clich 'badass' mode to convince him to do so. After he refuses, she puts a scalpel to his neck and calmly tells him what he needs to do. Any other emotion would've been fine, she could've acted hysterical by screaming at him to please do what the kidnapper says, cry, panic, act desperate, but for her to calmly and confidently tell him in the stereotypical low voice that he's GOING to do this, made me want to kill her myself.

**When the emo dude gets captured, and the two girls are watching, who's holding who back? WTF were they doing? Girl #1 acts like she wants to go run to him, only to be held back by Girl #2, but then Girl #2 is now trying to run towards him, only to be held back by the Girl #1. Who's holding who back? WTF was this?? I can only imagine what the director must've told them to do in this scene (""yeah, just act panicked and stuff, that's all I've got."")

**After the main girl's sister got killed in the collision, she had NO EMOTION. Ridiculous.

**When they had the two captured guys in Rusty's shed, how coincidental was it for the emo's favorite game to be craps, since Rusty's wall was covered with the consequences for each dice roll outcome. So what if he would've said his favorite game was Monopoly or something?

**Again, not something I can criticize too much since every movie is guilty of it, but when the main girl knocks out Rusty with the shovel, of course she doesn't make sure he's out cold or dead, she just throws her shovel away.

**Along with death and taxes, here's something else that's guaranteed; I can guarantee that during the scene where Rusty was on top of the truck, anyone watching that scene was thinking the same thing: ""Hit the brakes!""

**In this same scene, it was nighttime when he was on top of the truck, then early daytime when he was inside. OK, so she must've drove throughout the night right? Well how the HELL did her boyfriend show up seconds later after she jumped out of the careening vehicle? That's gotta be miles that he would've hobbled on one leg, OVERNIGHT. Nevermind the fact that he appeared seemingly within seconds.

**I'm gonna give this movie the benefit of the doubt and assume that the ridiculous ending line where the boyfriend asked ""is it over,"" as she looks heroically over the cliff and kicks the wallet and says ""it is now,"" was tongue in cheek. I really, REALLY hope this was meant to be campy and not a serious scene.

**It's ridiculous that they made this trucker into an omnipotent supernatural demigod, being able to see your every move, come in and out of cars without being seen, and able to survive crashing in an exploding semi going over a cliff.

My god, that main girl is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot.",1259798400,6,5494,4.414031620553359
3543957,4,B001DZOC64,This is a blood struck sick and scary movie that I love. Joy ride was great and this is even better. Rusty Nails (the phsyco trucker) loves to tourche and kill people that bother him for any reason which makes watching all the fun to see who servies and who dies!!!,1255996800,,265,4.215686274509804
3543968,3,B001DZOC64,"I actually found this little flick entertaining.  Maybe it was because of blonde bombshell Nicki Aycox (from Jeepers Creepers 2) who turned in a sexy performance as the main heroine.  She promises Rusty Nails ""I'll do whatever you want"" and it becomes a sick, twisted game.  I saw the first Joy Ride flick starring Paul Walker and found it amusing, but more of a suspense thriller.  This time around the villain Rusty Nails is much more sadistic it seems.

Of course as the movie goes on you kinda ask yourself ""why would Rusty Nails do all this for the reason he is?""  But one of my real gripes is about how the main male characters were portrayed.  They started out as jokesters who were all badass, then as the movie goes on you see they are wimps.  Maybe they were made to look like quivering wussies so Rusty Nails would look more powerful, but the one guy (Nick Zano) was like a built football player and didn't try much in the way of escaping.  The other guy was supposed to be a rebel but turned into a shivering coward later on.

The dice game torture was pretty sick, almost like the producers were trying to copycat Texas Chainsaw Massacre a bit.  I'm hoping for a third installment in this series, and seeing as Saw has now reached part 6 I don't see why we can't get Joy Ride 3.  It'd be cool to find out more about the origins of Rusty Nails, but then again maybe he's just a trucker who lost his mind.  I won't spoil the end of Joy Ride 2, but we know how horror movies tend to work with their villains.

All in all though, if you enjoy horror movies with a bit of gore, some hot chicks and a decent plot give this movie a rent.",1254268800,3,1643,4.241157556270096

3543970,4,B001DZOC64,"I'm giving this movie 4 stars. The torture scenes were well done. I liked the idea of the victims deciding each others fate. While not all kills were original, it kept in line with Rusty's menacing acts. Which was a good thing to see remain from the original.

The plot is decent enough to make you wonder, and in usual fashion you have the people you want to see survive, and then end up toast. How does it all work out? Watch and find out. I was pleasantly pleased with this one because Rusty is actually in pretty good shape for a trucker, but not so over the top that it is unrealistic.

Also Rusty toys with his victims. It wasn't that he was making them promises he was just toying with them before ""the final nail"" was placed. I won't spoil anything like some of the other reviewers do because I let other people judge for themselves when it comes to sequels. Especially direct to DVD ones.

It's worth a look. Especially for the end and keeping with tradition. In the original you never get a look at Rusty. The movie leads you on to believe that you do, but at the end it completely fools you.",1247529600,4,1102,4.288461538461538
3543971,1,B001DZOC64,"Joy Ride was a good scary movie where no one got killed (except the man in the ice truck), the boys played a prank on Rusty Nail so he messed with them, okay fine, and we know he lived at the end. Part 2 the kids just borrowed the car no big deal, so Rusty Nail tortures them like the movie SAW. I didn't want to give it a poor rating because I don't like torture movies, but he lived at the end??? There's no way! This movie deserves a zero. He even killed a few people which was not what the first one was about.

3543974,3,B001DZOC64,"Not as good as the original, but they hardly ever are. This movie see's a brand new cast of kids heading to Vegas to get married. Along the way there car breaks down and the stumble onto what is Rusty Nails house. They break in and borrow Rustys car, leaving a note to say they will return it, and continue on there way.

When Rusty gets home, for whatever reason, he decides to chase them down and take them on a JoyRide of his own.

The first movie had a much more interesting plot and not many kills, this one is not set mostly through CB dialog and inside car views, this time Rusty uses his house and you get to know him a little bit better.

The ending of the movie was dumb, you can set up a sequel better then the lame way they ended this movie. There seems to have been about 5 different cameras used to film this one, as it goes from that movie looking image, to a hand held camera, to a cheap midday movie style, and sometimes the editing can be a distraction from whats going on in the movie.

Don't expect to see something as good as the original, but this ones ok for what it is, just ignore that last few seconds of the film.",1228953600,,1140,4.075892857142857

Is a pretty good movie,much better than I expected.
As a big Nick Zano fan it was good to see him in this movie.

All the actors were very effective in their roles, ""Kyle Schmid"" recently seen in Zerophilia was a treat to watch as the cocky so called tough guy who gets reduced to a blubbering emotional wreck after being forced to get in drag and walk through a bevy of rednecks and at his breaking point admits to his myspace date his tattoos are fake and he's basically just a wimp living a bad boy fantasy.

The movie has plenty of action and the scene where the guys are tied up and have to roll dice to decide each others torture device fates is pretty hard to watch but very effective .Especially the hysterical ""Schmid"" still in remnants of tranny wear and makeup.
Nicki Aycox is very good as the distraught heroine who is fighting to save the life of her boyfriend ""Zano"".
I didn't think I was going to like it but once I turned it on I couldn't stop watching.",1226793600,2,990,4.26063829787234
3543976,3,B001DZOC64,"Well, they stole the guy's prize show car.  Oh, that's okay because they left a note and promised to bring it back.  And when they took it, they of course had to fish tail it down the road to see what it could do.  For the four young people in this movie that 'borrowed' the car I could sum up no sympathy what so ever.  Maybe they did not deserve what they got but they sure weren't some group of innocents.  On the other hand, how much did ole Rusty Nail care for his car?  After all, he does destroy it later in the film.  By the way after he destroys his car, you can clearly see that the left side of his truck is smashed in with the headlight busted out and then a few seconds later the truck is without a scratch and the headlight is working perfectly.  Hmmm.  Continuity problem?  Speaking of continuity, Bobby gets his kneecap busted in one scene and a moment later, he's all over the pain, rolling the dice again and then a few minutes later, he's limping across the desert.  What???  Anyway, despite unlikable characters who are dumber than dirt, this movie is okay for an hour and a half of mindless torture.  My real problem with this film is the way the four young people just did what they were told.  The finger?  Shoot, I would have seen through that one.  Melissa's little striptease in front of the truck?  Okay, at least the explanation for that made some kind of sense, I guess, but would anyone actually do that?  Sending Nik into the trucker's playground in drag?  Why not just cut his throat and throw him out of the car and get it over with?  What were they thinking?  Finally, my last problem with 'JOY RIDE 2' is the way Melissa handled that truck in the end.  She jumped in that rig and drove it like she'd been a trucker for 20 years.  Shoot, I would have had a hard time figuring out how to start a rig like that let alone drive it like a pro.  At least she has career potential ahead of her as a driver.  As far as the acting goes:  Well, you really don't pick up these type of movies for the great performances, but over all the cast actually did pretty well, especially Nicki Aycox as Melissa.  The bottom line is, this:  You could do worse.  This movie is not great and does not pretend to be great.  There are some scenes that will make you a little uneasy and make you squirm, but all in all, not a total waste of an hour and a half.  By the way, as other reviewers have already pointed out, there obviously is a sequel coming down the highway. And please: Don't borrow vintage cars without permission.",1225929600,2,2538,4.235908141962422
3543977,3,B001DZOC64,"The thrills and adrenaline-pumping excitement in the original Joy Ride begins when two brothers play a cruel prank on a seemingly love-lorn trucker named Rusty Nail. The rest of the movie is a roller coaster ride with a slam bang finale and a twisty ending.

The new movie Joy Ride 2 centers on two couples heading for Las Vegas.  One of the guys suggest they use a back road because it's shorter(damn  the old ""let's use the back road"" cliche)  Naturally their car breaks down and they start walking and remember- they are on a deserted back road.  They eventually come across a seemingly deserted house and shed.  They break into the house find nothing useful then inspect the shed where they find a wall loaded with nasty looking implements and do find a lovingly restored sports car which they reason they will ""borrow"" until they find a rental in the next town and return the sports car.  One of the girls leaves contact information for the owners if they return(stupid, stupid girl) Of course this is a horror movie and the owner turns out to be--yes you guessed right--it's Rusty Nail.

The balance of the movie is sadism, mutilation and some rather gruesome death scenes.  One poor soul has his entire jawbone ripped from his face(not shown) but you do get to see the jawbone -teeth and all. The metal rod through the top of the head through the chin is gross(but i saw a similar scene in a 1980's horror flick-The Prowler)  The movie has a lot of tense moments but unlike the first movie the tense scenes are sadistic and bloody while the first movie the thrills and tense moments were more from chase scenes with the maniacal Rusty and his truck.  The movie is worth a watch but it will make you squirm.

One piece of advice...Never give Rusty Nail the finger unless you are not fond of five digits on each hand.",1224374400,11,1822,4.538226299694189

8295577,4,B001DZOC64,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2008 and directed by Louis Morneau, Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead chronicles events on the desert highways out West when 4 youths on their way to Las Vegas breakdown and come across Rusty Nail, the diabolical trucker from 2001s Joy Ride.

One of the reasons Duel (1971) is so memorable is because it was believable. Something like it COULD happen. Joy Ride was cut from the same cloth, but added the youth element and the slasher angle. It was engaging enough, but ruined by mounting improbabilities, particularly in the last act.

Joy Ride 2 is better, with a few notable scenes, but its also marred by cartoony horror implausibilities. The prologue, for instance, made me bust out laughing (youll know what I mean). Still, the movie successfully makes a mysterious trucker and his ominous truck a formidable horror icon.

Nicki Aycox arises as the female protagonist with mettle while statuesque Laura Jordan plays her sister. Both are serviceable in the female department. Nick Zano is solid as the male protagonist, but his role is limited. Meanwhile Kyle Schmid is extremely obnoxious as the arrogant goth punk or whatever. Rusty Nail gives him a nice slice of humble pie.

THE MOVIE RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, Canada (the Thompson-Nicola Region, east of the Cascades). WRITERS: James Robert Johnston & Bennett Yellin.
