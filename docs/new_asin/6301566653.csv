Though the film is vivid in colour, the piece,as a whole, is extremely tedious and slow. Sorry,but a film about stifling isolation with an undercurrent of sexual repression in 1950's Cameroon just simply is NOT interesting. Could it have been? Here is hoping that no other director tries!",1171670400,,396,4.925373134328358
7812572,4,6301566653,"Much less famous than the 1992 film with the same name, this French film (with subtitles), originally produced in 1989, is set in French colonial Cameroon.  Written and directed by Claire Denis, it is the semi-autobiographical tale of a child growing up as the daughter of the French governor of a remote part of Cameroon.  The film opens in 1989 with an African man and his son swimming and playing tag at the beach, while from a distance, France Dalens (Mireille Perrier), a woman of about thirty, sits in the shade and watches.  This separation sets the scene for the entire film, as the white and black characters occupy totally different spaces.  When the man, Mungo, offers her a ride to the nearest town, she takes it, the scenery on the ride calling up memories of her childhood, to which the film flashes back.

The film has very little dialogue, the director using the camera to tell the story visually, highlighting the unspoken dialogues within the characters.  France, the child (Cecile Ducasse), is able to participate in the life of the black servants, especially Protee (Isaach De Bankole), the handsome ""house boy,"" who teaches her to eat insects, among other things, while she is also being educated by her mother, Aimee, in the ways of colonial society.  Aimee (Giulia Boschi), often alone in this remote area while her husband is traveling, is clearly attracted to Protee, though never a word reveals this.  Gestures, glances, and the camera's observations make the sexual tension clear.  When an airplane is forced to make an emergency landing and the crew and passengers come to the house to stay until parts can be brought in and a new runway built, the added tensions, and one visiting Frenchman's suspicions about Aimee's attraction to Protee, lead to dramatic confrontations and changes.

The camera work (Robert Alazraki) is brilliant.  The viewer could freeze-frame any scene and end up with photograph of stunning composition, color, and psychological revelation.  Architectural framing, lines and angles drawing the eye into the scene in the manner of great paintings, and stark contrasts of texture, light, characters, and color make the film an unforgettable experience.  Though the colonial story is not unusual, its presentation as a visual story, rather than as a verbal one, results in a subtlety that is refreshing, though this approach also leads to a story without a great deal of overt drama.  Students of cinematography, photography, and painting, however, may find the visual artistry of this film so exciting that its dramatic limitations seem less significant.
