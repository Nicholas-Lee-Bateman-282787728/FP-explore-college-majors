8751981,4,B01BZDZI2K,"This event is their traditional two night ""All Star Weekend"" event with Amazon not listing both Blu-Ray editions of the show, I'll review them both here.

Night One:
P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong faced off against Matt Sydal that saw both men work a different pace going through multiple series of counters & reversals from either impactful power moves to high risk maneuvers to submissions with the aftermath resulting in big surprise.  Tag Team Champions Young Bucks defended the titles against Tomasso Ciampa & Johnny Gargano which saw some entertaining moments with Ciampa & Gargano having no issues resorting stooping to the same level as the Bucks with their tactics from being what the crowd described as ""suck f's"" to double teaming which got more aggressive as the match went on.  Sami Callahan made his surprise return against Drew Gulak literally beating the shirt of him with crowd participation in his favor as the battle went around ringside using the environment with it not always working out how intended while working a submission based style inside as this was a physical match that saw Sami pull out a side of Gulak not previously seen.  Other matches include Michael Elgin returning to reunite the Unbreakable F'n Machines with Brian Lee against the American Wolves (Davey Richards & Eddie Edwards) also making their returns to P.W.G. in a ""power vs. speed"" contest with both teams showcasing some unique teamwork; Trevor Lee vs. Will O'Spreay with Lee showing a more aggressive attitude towards his opponent & the crowd; Mike Bailey vs. Kenny Omega in a first time meeting that involved both men attempting to ""take out the trash""; Marty Scurll vs. Ricochet that was a back & forth contest that saw a mix of athleticism & just dirty cheating tactics whenever possible; and Mark Andrews vs. Chuck Taylor in an athletic contest that saw one man get references to another legendary ""big sexy"" wrestler.

Night Two:
World's Cutest Tag Team & Mike Bailey & Chris Hero teamed up here to face Mount Rushmore 2.0 (Roderick Strong & Young Bucks) with Adam Cole who returned the previous night with an agenda to take over P.W.G. showcasing that by attacking two people associated with the company before the match began that had brawling all around ringside with them using whatever possible from chairs to their own title belts along with many more weapons to what they used on Joey Ryan to give him a ""superkick vasectomy"" in a battle that got so out of control that other's got physically involved including one man that nobody saw coming.  Will O'Spreay faced off in the first time meeting against Kenny Omega that was a physical clash of styles including an entertaining moment where one of Omega's unorthodox methods of attack was used against him.  Unbreakable F'n Machines faced off against Johnny Gargano & Tommaso Ciampa where the Machines were dominate with their power while Gargano & Ciampa worked a faster pace & heavily working over specific part of the body.  Other matches include Chuck Taylor vs. Kikutaro in a very entertaining match just knowing both men's personalities; Marty Scurll vs. Timothy Thatcher in a physical british style encounter with both men working over different joints of the body; Mark Andrews vs. Ricochet in a back & forth encounter; and Trevor Lee vs. Matt Sydal in a competitive match.

You got exactly what you expect from P.W.G. both nights in surprises, entertainment & quality wrestling matches.",1467331200,,3457,4.977469670710572
