7554316,5,B018RHKQO2,"Who knew John Ford could help explain the vicissitudes of the global conflict between Islamists and the West?

French writer Thomas Bidegain (A Prophet, Rust and Bone, Dheepan) does just that with his stunning directorial debut, Les Cowboys, a tense, utterly absorbing, and heartrending reworking of Ford's 1956 masterpiece The Searchers.

Bidegain takes Ford's tale - about a years-long quest by an aging Texan (John Wayne) to find his young niece after she's kidnapped by a Comanche chief - and ingeniously retrofits it to serve as a powerful, complex parable about relations between Europeans and Arabs.

Epic in scope, covering more than a dozen years from 1994 into the 2010s, Les Cowboys succeeds because it explores its themes through a deeply intimate story about the travails of a single family.

The drama opens at a country-western fair in rural France, where local amateur singer Alain (Franois Damiens) is wowing the audience with a soulful rendition of ""The Tennessee Waltz.""

A father of two who seems to have an ideal relationship with his family, Alain is plunged into the terrifying unknown when his 16-year-old daughter, Kelly (Iliana Zabeth), runs away with her militant Islamist beau, Ahmed (Mounir Margoum).

Damiens projects an almost rabid intensity as a man totally unwilling to accept that his daughter could want a different life. Like one of his western heroes, the Stetson-wearing Alain tears around half of Europe and a good chunk of the Middle East in a desperate bid to find his girl.

Bidegain's pacing is odd and a bit confusing. He covers nearly eight years in the first 30 minutes, then changes the tempo when the search is taken up by Alain's son Georges (Finnegan Oldfield).

But this is when the film really comes into its own. While his father nursed a raging hatred of Muslims, Georges is a gentler, more tolerant, more introspective man who finds beauty in a culture his dad despised. He enters post-Sept. 11 Pakistan as an aid worker, then teams up with a sleazy American arms dealer (John C. Reilly) who abandons him after a messy shooting incident.

An unforgettable, revelatory psychological thriller, Les Cowboys somehow manages to end with a suggestion of hope, if not redemption.",1468540800,4,2228,5.032608695652174

Beware and be aware about what is really going on with our lives, families, countries.
Is this really ""Us"" to make sacrifices to suffer or somebody else's interest's consequences...

8742789,4,B018RHKQO2,"I had read that this was a remake of The Searchers, and although there are is some homage at least to the earlier film, it stands alone. Quiet, focused, impeccable sense of place. The story is really subtext to the throughline of a life grounded on (often buried) obsession. Highly recommend for fans of the Dardenne brothers' work (one of them is a producer here).",1477526400,,365,4.630769230769231
8742790,4,B018RHKQO2,"This film starts in 1994 when we meet father and husband Alain Deland who is a lover of all things American  especially both their kinds of music  Country and Western. His family seem more than happy to participate in the group outings too and from an outsiders perspective they are a perfect nuclear family. Then on a day when they are having a festival his daughter goes missing.

What at first seems to be a case of abduction, or indeed worse, take on a different hue when she decides to contact them. That is when the story takes a massive U turn and nothing is as it should be. This is a remake of The Searchers which is one of the best westerns ever made and this take  though original  is far removed from the sheer timeless beauty of the original John Ford classic

Now this starts off fairly light hearted at the beginning but it soon gets very dark very quickly  which is like the original. That is where the similarities end. It does have a bristling, brooding quality that makes it very compelling. It is a hard watch in places and that is in part due to the energy that Francois Damiens brings as the grieving father. This is a film that deals with difficult themes in a realistic way and is both well aced, directed, written and is for fans of Gallic cinema.",1475452800,2,1272,4.364406779661017
