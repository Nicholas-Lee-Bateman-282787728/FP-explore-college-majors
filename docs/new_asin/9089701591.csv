1172424,5,9089701591,I was so surprised to find the second freshwater aquarium in this DVD had the very same tropical fish shown just like my tropical fish I actually grew up with and enjoyed with my mother helping me keep my aquariums clean back in the 1960s. I am so happy that I got to purchase this aquarium dvd because that second freshwater tank and fish look almost exactly like the top 20 gallon tank I had until the slate bottoms of both 20 gallon tanks wore out. Wow its like the 1960s have came back to me retrolly as I enjoy viewing this second freshwater tank aquarium on this dvd. Also the first marine salt water fish tank and tropical salt water fish were splendidly made beautiful too!! So far I like the Aquarium Juke Box DVD and Aquarium Juke Box 2 and enjoy from time to time looking at those tropical fish dvds also. This makes 3 Tony Helsloot Aquarium DVDS I have so far collected from Amazon.com. I think Tony Helsloot and his crew make these Aquarium DVDs absolutely GREAT!! Thanks I hope they can make more good aquarium dvds like these 3 that I enjoy now.,1405296000,,1060,4.358585858585859
1172425,5,9089701591,Bought because having surgery and water relaxes me and not able to leave home.  Grandchildren love it also. Thank you,1402358400,,117,4.85
1172426,5,9089701591,I originally got this to entertain my cats. I didn't expect I would love it as much as my cats do. Love having choices of aquariums and sounds. Very very soothing. Quality is really good. I forget it is a DVD. It arrived with lightening speed in just 2 days!,1391040000,7,258,4.18
1172427,5,9089701591,From the many aquarium ambient movies we have this is one of the best. Too many of them have very short scenes badly shot in general but this one is just perfect. Really long half hour scenes and it does turn our large TV into an aquarium. Kids are fascinated by this and it is one of the better DVD's around.,1389657600,7,309,4.081967213114754

1172435,5,9089701591,"This DVD shows two tropical tanks and two freshwater tanks, each containing a glorious assortment of several different species of colourful fish.  The tropical tanks include rocks and rocky formations with plants growing between them, and I enjoy watching the vividly coloured fish swimming around these rocks and plants.  The freshwater tanks have more greenery and again a superb variety of multi-coloured fish.  I also like the fact that each tank has a choice of three sound tracks, which include music and the sounds of nature.

These discs are wonderful to play either when I want to relax from any stresses of the day or as background effects when my family or friends are visiting.  The tanks have a nicely calming and restful effect on my visitors and me.  I also find these programs very useful when I am reading or studying while I play this disc in the background.",1432598400,,876,4.806666666666667
1172436,5,9089701591,Much better than I thought it would be.,1431648000,,39,4.0
1172437,5,9089701591,"Whether you want a freshwater aquarium or rather a tropical aquarium, with this DVD you can get both on your television. There are two freshwater aquariums between which you can choose, both with bright green plants and colorful little fish. As with the tropical aquariums you can choose the sounds you want to hear. There are ocean waves, bubble sounds and relaxing music between which you can choose. The fish in both tropical aquariums are larger and swim around between colorful coral. You can watch the beautiful fish in the aquarium without owning an aquarium yourself. The picture quality is very good and the colors of the fish are brilliant. A very nice DVD with great realistic looking aquariums, I can highly recommend it.",1429574400,,733,4.919354838709677

1172442,4,9089701591,"This is a good Aquarium DVD shot in superb looking HD video. Looks as good as a DVD disc can get.

Personally, I like the two Tropical aquariums much better than the Freshwater ones which have many small fish. In addition, I wish the Tropical tanks had the ""bubbles"" sound option like the Freshwater tanks. Also it is very odd and unrealistic to me listening to ocean waves coming from an indoor Saltwater tropical aquarium! So too, while the second tropical aquarium has really beautiful coral, it only has 6 total fish in it, unlike the first tropical aquarium which has around 16.

So in the end, this DVD video looks great though the content was a mixed bag for me.

Edit: I got this same content of this DVD via Vimeo which offered the same content in MP4's format ( 1080P). Now it looks GREAT on my Samsung HDTV! Also did some software work and took the bubbles sound from the freshwater ones. Then I removed the wave sounds from the Tropical's and put in the bubbles on the Tropical's. Voila!",1420761600,5,999,4.478021978021978

1172445,4,9089701591,Excellent quality and very sharp graphics. I use this dvd on a regular basis...I like the bubble sounds for background. The only caveat would be if there was more choices of background soundtracks.,1418169600,2,197,5.0
1172446,5,9089701591,My little one has a hard time going to sleep at night and this DVD solved that! I put this on in his room and it replays over and over! He sleeps with no more waking up and running to moms bed! I love that you can play the music and the water sounds together! Great quality (I will be back to buy from them again) I think next year we will grab a winter dvd for Christmas :O),1417996800,,375,3.759493670886076

1172448,5,9089701591,"Very cool to have the experience of an aquarium without the fuss and mess. Clever idea, great purchase or gift for anyone that enjoys having a fish tank but hasn't the time or desire to maintain one.  For example, nice to be able to travel without worrying about who will feed your fish. There are four tanks to choose from with a variety of background sounds, or silence.  It's mesmerizing.  I bought more as gifts as everyone that views it seems to want one.",1415491200,,460,4.4523809523809526
1172449,5,9089701591,"There are a lot of aquarium DVDs around - this is one of the best ones - the difference between the Tropical and Freshwater fish and backgrounds are striking. The fish in both have vivid colors and the tracks are long enough and different enough that it keeps you watching. It has water sounds and music (which is really nice). I decided to try both and neither too. The photography is as usual, excellent. If you like watching fish, you'll love this DVD",1414886400,,454,4.481927710843373
1172450,5,9089701591,"The DVD is like having the real thing in your home without all the mess. The fish are beautiful and I love the choices of sound or not as you wish. I find it restful to sit back and watch the show of color as they swim through the coral. I am extremely happy with this purchase, thank you.",1412208000,,289,3.9152542372881354

7901260,2,9089701591,"The video claims to be shot in HD. I know that can't be technically true, since it's a DVD and not blu-Ray. However, the quality is terrible. It is extremely grainy. As other reviewers have point out, it would be better to have the bubbles sound option for the sea water tanks, rather than the ocean. I've found better versions on YouTube I can stream to my TV. I was just hoping to find a dvd that could serve as a fake aquarium. I find the sound and visuals soothing when I work. My search will continue.",1445212800,,506,4.22680412371134
