2602352,5,B000G8NXAA,"Patricia Arquette really delivers as her character, Alison DuBois.

I can watch the dvd over and over again.",1163030400,2,108,5.0
2602353,5,B000G8NXAA,"Medium is a very good adult audience supernatural suspense series. The show is mostly convincing with a stellar performance on the part of Ms. Arquette, and most of the supporting cast is excellent. It is unfortunate that the part of Mr. Dubois (who is supposed to be a rocket scientist) is so unsympathetic, and seems to be a bit slow.  Now I am aware that many gifted mathematicians have a missing element socially, but the real Mr. Dubois in interview, does not seem so. However, in ""Sweet Dreams""episode,(ala ""It's a Wonderful Life""), Joe is what you would hope he would be for the rest of the series, so go figure. The children of the show are a mixed bag, but talented child actors are few and far between.

The crimes that are solved are not family friendly, but the show is about half about the family dynamic of their unique situation. Which makes for pretty good drama, my reservations notwithstanding.  One of the recurring bad guys in the show is an evil spirit that is the source for psychosis in mentally ill criminals. I don't like the inference, but it is an interesting proposal.

That being said, this show is fascinating, if you can accept that the real Allison Dubois is truly anything like purported in the show.",1161907200,,1233,4.6422018348623855
2602354,4,B000G8NXAA,"After establishing itself as a very unique series, MEDIUM moves into its second season with 22 episodes, and the continued strong presence of star Patricia Arquette.  Ironically, one of the show's strong points turned into a weak point this season:  the focus on the family problems seemed to override the central ""crime"" part a little too much this season, with Ariel and Bridgit's ""minor crises"" becoming too much like ""Mother Knows Best"".  They included Ariel's falling for a 21 year old in a convenience store and later a 14 year old rich boy, whose doctor father may be a psychotic killer.  Add hubby Joe's problems at work and with his wife's gift, you got a lot of familial focus.  That's admirable in some ways, but it tended to dilute a lot of the more powerful storylines unfolding.  There were some decent chills and some clever plot twists with lurid defense attorney Connor O'Farrell returning for a few episodes, as despicable as ever, and other guest appearances from stars such as Molly Ringwald, David Carradine and David James Elliott.  Arquette's brother Ryan Hurst returns as a possible bank robber; executive producer Kelsey Grammer has a neat turn as the Angel of Death; and sleazy doctor Mark A. Sheppard returns as the psycho who gets doctors to kill their patients.  One strange episode is included with 3-D glasses, and it's storyline is so convoluted, one misses the point and the 3-D effects are far from innovative, they tend to be distractive.

But Arquette, Jake Weber and the girls do come across as a strong family and little Maria Lark is a hoot.  All in all, MEDIUM is a good show, I just wish it would focus more on the meat of the stories than the endless family crises.",1160092800,4,1707,4.736486486486487
2602355,5,B000G8NXAA,I absolutely love this show!  I saw an episode once while in a waiting room and couldn't wait until I got home to see when it came on again.

2602370,5,B000G8NXAA,My goodness this show is so good. I cry or get wigged out almost every episode. Joe is such a closed-minded jerk but it really says a lot about how strong their love is that he's able to get over himself at the end of the day to help her and she still lets him ground her in reality. And I love Scanlon and Devalos. Plus there are so many guests stars that I'm like holy moly it's them! Like Emma stone and rami malek,1484265600,,417,3.9176470588235293

2602409,5,B000G8NXAA,"Great show.  Netflix streaming removed this, so now I'm watching it via amazon prime.  Only bad thing is that amazon prime doesn't keep track of which episodes you've watched already.  Yes I realize amazon would not know which episodes I watched through netflix, but I'm talking about episodes I've watched through amazon prime.  I like the premise of the show, the characters and how they interact, the family, the mystery, and the subtle humor in the show.  I think some episodes over do it with gory details sometimes, but it's a great show.",1474848000,,544,4.806451612903226

2602438,4,B000G8NXAA,"I would give this show a 5/5 star if it wasn't for the awful relationship between Allison and her husband Joe. It's almost painful to watch sometimes. I don't know if this is on purpose (the show portrays them to love each other very much but ya, all marriages have problems) or the writers don't know what a healthy and supportive relationship looks like (because all they do is fight. Literally every scene is a fight with them). I hate the husband and it kind of took away from the show for me. Otherwise, its awesome. .",1470268800,,523,4.402061855670103

2602442,5,B000G8NXAA,A fantastic series. The shows always makes me wonder about the real Alison Dubois and her family. I love watching the transition from skepticism (even by her own husband at times) to unfailing belief. I do wish they could have found a way to include Captain Push (of the Texas Rangers) in more of the story lines. Such a great character!,1469404800,,337,4.540983606557377

2602449,4,B000G8NXAA,"I love Medium. But one quibble with the Van Gogh episode. Van Gogh did not shoot himself in his little bedroom. He died in a corn field. And an interview with a woman who was a little girl at the time of his death suggests that two boys who were often out shooting in the same field had accidentally shot Van Gogh. The little girl didn't tell about this event until she was an old lady, due to the fact that she couldn't stand the grouchy painter & she was also loath to get the boys into trouble.
Other than that, this series is fun to watch.
WARNING: in the episode (season 2) which begins with baby Allison being forced into a neighbor child's clothing, there is a scene which includes a dog that was shot to death. It is graphic. The dog is panting his last breaths. I HATE this type of scene. I absolutely HATE when animals suffer. This is too harsh for this show. I am very sorry I saw this scene & will skip this episode. Please stop the cruelty to animals in TV shows & movies. It does NOT enhance anything about any story.",1468713600,2,1031,4.185929648241206

2602451,5,B000G8NXAA,"I love the crime/drama plots. But I don't love Allison's eccentricity, even if she can't help it. If I were Joe, I couldn't live with it. She's a lovable character, but a real human partner would tire of her antics pretty fast. It's eerily similar to living with an alcoholic. Eventually, you have to separate yourself to keep you and your family's sanity. I don't think I could watch this if I knew it represented the real DuBois family, or any real family, for that matter. But it couldn't. The real DuBois family couldn't have survived that.",1468627200,2,544,4.618556701030927

The premise of a clairvoyant, assisting law enforcement solve crimes is not an easy sell. Patricia Arquette is fascinating and believable as a flawed, yet loving mother with an unusual gift that makes her life interesting. Kudos to her t.v. husband, Jake Weber, for keeping the marriage and family together when things go awry (on a regular basis). Their attempts to parent 3 adorable daughters who have a touch of mom's gift, with laughter and genuine affection, add a surprisingly sweetness to an otherwise dark and sometimes sinister storyline.",1459209600,,682,5.04424778761062

2602513,5,B000G8NXAA,"I love this show!! It's refreshing to see the family dynamics played throughout this series. Bridgette is absolutely adorable and really outdoes her character with precociousness and innocence. Ariel can come across as bratty in some scenes but always ends up showing her love for her family. I wish I could meet somebody like Joe who empowers his character by being patient, supportive, comforting and keeping everybody down to earth. Allison can be a little annoying when she gets carried away over a dream that means something different than what she thinks. Still she does a great job with her character. I'm only on Season 3 so it will be fun to see how Manuel, David (love them!) and all the other characters play out.",1456704000,,724,4.8

2602585,5,B000G8NXAA,Surprisingly good. I enjoy watching the series when cable has nothing to offer and I'm not working. It's got some comedy along with lots of heartfelt scenes. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions (in a good way). 2 thumbs up for this series.,1439856000,,242,4.5227272727272725

I enjoy the peek into the daily life of this family.  they're not perfect.  at times, i dislike what one of the characters says or does.  The dialogue is often humorous...we've adopted some of the lines into our daily life. several of the characters are so likable, especially arliss howard as Cap' Push.  the continuing story line with patricia arquette receiving information from the beyond and using it to help solve mysteries and crimes is very, very interesting.  some of the crimes make me extremely uncomfortable, especially when they involve children.  some episodes are scary!  one thing is consistent, all episodes are interesting and very re-watchable.  i agree with the other reviewers who say that the show is addicting.  for several years, i've checked out medium from my local library in a continuous loop.  once i reached the final episode for that year, i'd request season one again and start over.  i just received all seasons, except the final season, as a christmas gift.  woo hoo!  treat yourself - get any season of medium.  you won't regret it.",1295136000,,1334,4.8061674008810575

You'd think with the amount of money they spend on making this a top notch show, would it kill them to remember not everyone has perfect hearing...or maybe we should be 'sensitive' enough to 'know what the characters are saying!!!'

Maybe for season Four they'll put subtitles for the hearing impaired!!!!--or if the show ends and they decide to 'box-set' it with extra goodies and Easter Eggs...duh may they'll throw in the subtitles!!!",1210377600,4,653,4.803571428571429

I got to the point where I was thinking that I rather just order it from Amazon and pay the extra toll, but then the show popped up in the shelf and it was whit much anticipation I took it home to watch it.

I was disappointed. Now do not get me wrong, the show was fine. But it was not nearly as good as the first season. Where I whit season 1 had just watched the episodes in quick succession until done, I now watched one now and then. I can not say what makes the first season better, I just think that the stories was better. This is still an above average DVD box though.

What is good whit Medium as opposed to the other psychic girl TV shows out there is that it portrays being psychic allot more realistic. That often one have to interpret visions and dreams one get, it often do not come out done like reading a book.

I liked the show well enough that I will get season 3. But it could have been better. But if you like the paranormal this show is worth watching.",1208995200,2,1121,4.017937219730942

Bland, cookie cutter ""whodunit"" stories for complete idiots. Check out a show called ""Dexter"" if you really want something like this done WELL!!!

I have to say though that Patricia Arquette's constant whiney delivery gets old very fast.  Whine, whine, whine, when she could just talk.  It makes her seem weak and out of control when that's not who Allison is at all.  I hope she can find another way of conveying upset.

The two older girls are good actors, expecially the oldest one.  She's a real beauty and I'm hoping they won't sexualize her.  She plays a young girl, not Britney Spears.  Let her be a kid, please.  The middle daughter has a strange delivery but it works.  Kind of a deep Shirley Temple, facial expressions and all.  My husband says she looks like Sam Kinneson!  They never brush her hair.  She's good though, our favorite.  The youngest hasn't developed a personality yet.

I hope this show goes on and on.  I'm even starting to get used to the husband's ways.  Watch it, you'll love it!",1179619200,,1069,4.412371134020619
2602654,5,B000G8NXAA,"Patricia Arquette stars as Allison Dubois, an otherwise ordinary wife and mother who has the ability to help solve crimes through her dreams. Over a series of nights, Allison sees more and more details about the victims, which she shares with her boss, Phoenix District Attorney Manuel Devalos, and detective Lee Scanlon.

On the homefront, Allison is accompanied by her laidback husband Joe, a scientist, and their three daughters, Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. The girls are far apart in age -- Ariel in junior high, Bridgette in elementary, and little Marie just a toddler -- giving room to all sorts of growing-up issues.

Season 2 includes some fantastic episodes, such as ""Time Out of Mind,"" where Allison dreams she's a woman who's been placed in a mental institution in the 1950s...only to discover there really was such a woman, who claimed to have been Allison Dubois, living in the future. Additionally, both Ariel and Bridgette experience some psychic abilities of their own.

Although there are other shows currently on air with extraordinary heroines, ""Medium"" continues to stand apart. Unlike some of the others, such as ""Ghost Whisperer"" starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, ""Medium"" doesn't try to make its cast look superhuman. Dreams aside, Allison's just a busy woman juggling a career and family, and she actually can be seen picking up dry cleaning or wearing old t-shirts as she hurriedly fixes her girls a late supper.

Conversely, ""GW""'s Melinda is perfect -- both in appearance and the way her life always goes her way -- which gets stale to the viewing audience pretty quickly. Who can possibly relate? Melinda's husband Jim has virtually no storylines of his own; his entire purpose appears to be supporting Melinda, listening to her prattle on about the cases she's working on, and maintaining the house for her as though he doesn't have a job himself. ""Medium,"" on the other hand, is too smart to insult its viewers by presenting such an improbable universe.

If you haven't ever seen ""Medium,"" I urge you to check it out immediately! You won't be disappointed.",1178236800,3,2083,5.008670520231214

Season 1 was 5 stars and season 2 is even better.  Of course most credit must be given to the amazing Patricia Arquette.  The entire show is upon her shoulder and she carries it off as the Emmy winner she is. Her acting is so subtle and intense. She can convey so much by her mere looks and reactions. She has developed this character with true aplomb. And she makes all the drama very real and believable.

There is not a single bad episode of this show and the supporting characters all hold their own as well.  I highly recommend this show for high quality drama, acting and true at the edge of your seat suspense.

The 3D episode is well worth watching & the pack included 2 pairs of glasses.

2602658,5,B000G8NXAA,I purchase Medium because I was curious.  I fall asleep too early to see the series on TV.  I started watching and I couldn't stop.  While based on an actual Medium I am sure the writters have a great time with the subject but it has a hint of realism.  My daughter a grandson agreed to watch the first disk and ended up staying up until the wee morning hours.  Beware... it is very addictive.,1170806400,8,393,4.1866666666666665
2602659,5,B000G8NXAA,"Just to let you know that Medium's got a lot of success in France too. Season 1 and season 2 have been broadcasted altogether from November 2005 to July 2006 with very good audience rate.

The main reasons for this success are pretty much the same everywhere I guess: very good cast lead by the unique Patricia Arquette who can make you laugh and cry from one minute to the other, supernatural atmosphere, suspense and of course, this more than real family life that makes you feel like you're spying on your neighbors apart from the fact that this family is far better than your neighbors, they're funny, loving and moving just like we wish we could all be.

Now I'm just looking forward to discover season 3!!!",1169078400,16,712,4.5546875
2602660,5,B000G8NXAA,We've watched this TV show since the beginning. We still enjoyed seeing this season all over again (as we did with season one). We did find there was an episode we had missed and we enjoyed each program as much as the first time we saw it! We especially enjoy watching the interaction between Joe and Allison. They truly have a chemistry going and their characters act like real married people!,1168473600,2,394,4.563380281690141
2602661,5,B000G8NXAA,"The second season is even better than the first, i bought the first season without ever having seen Medium before and was immediately hooked and started searching for the second season, can't wait for the third season to come out on DVD - this is a real must getter!!!",1168300800,,268,4.489795918367347

2602663,5,B000G8NXAA,"This show deserves even more than a 5 star rating!! Not long ago, Out of curiosity I rented the first disc of the first season because I had never watched this show. That was all it took. I WAS HOOKED!! I now OWN the first and second seasons on DVD and I am anxiously awaiting tomorrow night's new episode. This show is AWESOME. I LOVE Allison.",1167696000,,344,4.2272727272727275
2602664,5,B000G8NXAA,"Emmy winner Patricia Arquette returns in the second season of Medium. For everyone who enjoyed season 1 and has yet to see season 2, be prepared to love the show even more. This seasons blows the first out of the water.

I thought I would give a detailed episode by episdoe score. 1-10 with 10 being the best, and while it doesn't look like I gave out high scores all that often, a high score from me is like a 8 because I'm pretty stingy. The eps that scored lower generally didn't involve Arquette as much.

I thought this was a fantastic season. I loved season one as well, but this was even better. Patricia Arquette is so underrated despite her controversial (I don't think it was) Emmy win last year. The show is nothing without her. The episodes I gave high scores to she gives great performances in.

Every scene with Arquette and Jake Weber is a joy to watch, and I think her children are some of the best child actors I've ever seen. This season has a 3D episode and the box set comes with 3D glasses. They do a good job with it, and they also have the same episode in 2D.

The highlights of the season are ""The song remains the same"" which has the best opening dream sequence this shows had IMO, ""Method to his madness"" which has Allison become the killer they are searching for, ""Death takes a policy"" which features Kelsey Grammar, and the best ep of the season, the season finale ""Twice upon a time"" where Allison dreams of her life had she not become a medium.",1166745600,8,1985,4.311653116531165
2602665,5,B000G8NXAA,"Season 2 of ""Medium"" held up the high standard set in the shorter first season.  Patricia Arquette, Jake Weber, Maria Lark, Sophia Vassilieva do excellent jobs involving us in the fairly commonplace dynamics of the family's home life.  This is the center that grounds the series.  Added to that is the psychic ability of Allison Du Bois to see the dead and see the future.  The crime element as she works with Miguel Sandoval as District Attorney Devalos and David Cubitt as Detective Lee Scanlon make for a riveting series with amazing consistency.  In Season 2, David Cubitt's contributions become more thoroughly impressive as his wit and humor come to the fore.  Jake Weber also displays dry wit and exceptional comic timing.  Maria Lark's delightful mugs continue to charm as the young Bridget.  (I want to see Norah Jones' video of ""Sunrise"" in which Lark appears.)

Episodes that I enjoy re-watching repeatedly include ""Lucky In Love"" where Allison's brother Michael falls in love with a ghost.  ""Judge, Jury & Executioner"" is exceptionally well written as Allison tries to help the D.A. figure out how a ghost -- a man whose execution they witnessed -- could have committed a murder AFTER he died!  Purely for its ambitiousness, ""Still Life"" that presents a 3-D format is groundbreaking, unlike anything else attempted on TV.

The special features are interesting as we learn much of the backstage dynamics that go into producing the series.  This is currently my favorite TV series.  While I am riveted to Season 3, I am delighted to have Seasons 2 & 1 on DVD!  Bravo!

[Note: On my Disc 6, ""The Darkness Is Light Enough"" will not play.  Instead it goes into the season closer ""Twice Upon A Time,"" which also plays when I press the button for that selection.  I don't know if anyone else has experienced anything similar.  -- Maybe it's time for a new DVD player!]",1164326400,5,1873,4.796875
2602666,5,B000G8NXAA,"Having bought season 1, I was really keen to get my hands on season 2.  And it does not disappoint.  A six DVD set, this is crammed full of great episodes, a 3D extra episode and some extras like commentary and documentaries.

Again Patricia Arquette does not disappoint.  The supporting cast are excellent as usual.  Following on from season 1, the stories are more complex and the final episode of this season is a corker.  Why can't TV execs here in the UK commission shows like this?  The US always does this kind of thing much, much better.  Shown on the BBC it's dumped on late night/early morning which is a disgrace.  Give it primetime!

I would highly recommend this.  I got it for under 30 and it's been my best DVD buy by a country mile for some time.",1163635200,4,762,4.371428571428571
2602667,5,B000G8NXAA,"This is ""Medium"" --- The Complete Second Season, featuring 22 episodes of this amazing NBC series with performances by Emmy-award winning Patricia Arquette.

This DVD includes some excellent bonus features. The bonus features are as follows:

Commentaries --- For several episodes, featuring both crew and cast. These commentaries are insightful and entertaining and will definitely help you to understand certain aspects of the show better. It's too bad they couldn't do commentary for ""Death Takes a Holiday"" and ""Twice Upon a Time,"" but I suspect they were still wrapping work on those eps while this DVD set was being created.

The Story of ""Medium"" Season 2 - Highlights of the season from beginning to end. Discusses how things changed between season one and two, some of the highest-quality episodes, and more.

""Medium"" in Another Dimension --- Discusses the 3-D episode of the show, ""Still Life."" This is pretty interesting and has some insightful thoughts, but a lot of it is already covered in the commentary for that episode.

A Day in the Life of the Dubois Daughters --- Discusses the actresses that play the daughters of the show, as well as the characters themselves. Includes their school studies, how they prepare for the show and anecdotes and praise from other cast and crew.

The Museum of Television and Radio - Q&A with Cast and Creative Team --- Discusses the writing process for the show.

Gag Reel --- A fun gag reel, including mess-ups as well as joke scenes.

If you're a fan of ""Medium,"" or any good drama or science-fiction series, you can't afford to pass this up.",1163289600,23,1595,4.925373134328358

8129487,5,B000G8NXAA,"Much better than most of today's contemporary TV programs, this series has depth of character and it does not lose momentum through the first season.

The first DVD contains the conclusion to the cliffhangers from the first season. Some of the characters in the pilot to make it into the regular episodes. This package even has a fun though maybe distracting to some 3-D. I got out my glasses and ooohd and aaahd.

Great formula as Allison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) who has a gift since childhood of talking to the dead and getting physique vibes. She diagnoses or misdiagnoses crime scenes for a local district attorneys office. As her child puts it she is a ""guesser."" Natural they are the skeptics with negative attitudes to overcome and obscure mental images to be interpreted. She must also do this while balancing housework, kids, and a husband that can be snot at times. There is usually a quirky twist in the end of each episode.

Bottom line is that you can get hooked on the series and will feel cheated when you run out of episodes. It is interesting that they spread the abilities around in the family instead of keeping just to Allison.",1507075200,12,1150,4.683168316831683
