3918306,1,B002EOVXB0,"I have watched horror movies almost my whole life (50+ years) and I have never seen one more deplorable than this one.  To have teenager boys raping a girl found in a warehouse that was almost dead is inexcusable.  What is this telling the teenage boys of our time, that it's okay to do this?  How you could you even sell a movie like this?",1253836800,14,340,4.2
3918307,1,B002EOVXB0,"I just watched this movie a couple hours ago. I thought about it, i should write my own review. First of all i watched this movie because i read a lot of positive comments about this movie. A lot of them says this movie is brilliant, dark, hottest horror, indie classic, cleverly written etc. all that are a bunch of lies. there is nothing good or scary about this movie. This movie is soo sick, very unrealistic, and very stupid. heres why: first of all..this movie is about two best friends find themselves lost in the crumbling facility of a abandoned hospital. They found a body of a woman. One of them decided to keep the woman for sex. okay... here is the most stupid part of the movie, why would u keep a woman for sex that haven't take a shower for years and look like a zombie from resident evil AND the girl is soo filthy. (disgusting). iT'S like havin sex with a homeless person. That's nasty right?. Well, if u like watchin movies having sex with a homeless person that look like a zombie then i would say u need help. For those of you that says this movie is good, all i can say is.. u guys are sick and has no taste in good movies. This movie is garbage!!!!! Sucks!!! Very Stupid!!",1253404800,14,1195,4.2687224669603525
3918308,4,B002EOVXB0,"This uniquely odd little movie is quite hard to review without revealing spoilers.  Most reviewers have already given a thumbnail brief of the movies' plot and it is pointless for me re-iterating the same plot elements without giving away too many of the twists and turns of this one-of-a-kind strange, weird and refreshingly original film.  There are no explanations given for the title character-she is just there.  Naked and chained to a table in the basement of a long deserted insane asylum, she quietly accepts being a sex toy and even takes three bullets shot in her chest without a blink of an eye but she also has a very nasty secret.....she's very hungry and satisfies her hunger in a couple of ugly scenes including a bullying high school jock who learns the hard way that oral sex can be dangerous to your health.

The movie is well made for its' low budget but there is one huge flaw. The casting.  Sometimes teens try to act like adults but it's harder for adults to act or look like teens and I swear the actor playing the bullying jock is pushing 30.  But still the movie is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly tired and stale genre-(the low budget and direct to video scare flick)  I applaud the film-makers for a good try  and as a word of caution-please be careful what body part you aim in the direction of the dead girls' teeth. It can be very painful.",1253232000,3,1378,4.484
3918309,4,B002EOVXB0,"I must admit I thought I was in for watching a horror flick but the reality turned out to be much more satisfying. Yes, the premise of two high school buds stumbling upon a still animate dead girl secured to a gurney in the basement of an abandoned insane asylum sets one up for boatloads of horror stuff. That she is without clothing begs for teen horror trash treatment. But that's nearly where it ends.

This film takes a different approach in that it focuses on what happens due to the dead girl's discovery. The two chums are polar opposites. The one sees her as easy and available sex for as long as he wants, while the other (the more sensitive one) feels that approach is wrong whether she is dead or not. There lies the rub.

Of course their ""secret"" leaks out little by little which further complicates matters, and all things must come to a head.

This little gem was budgeted just well enough to further the story, with no more than was needed in the make-up department to get the point across. Though I didn't recognize any of the actors' names or faces, they all did stand-up jobs in their rolls. Some nifty twists and turns took place to keep the road cluttered even though one thinks they might see where the whole thing is going.

I tried to relate all this to my wife without too many spoilers and she said it sounded trashy and I realized you really need to see it to get it. Yes it IS trashy....kind of. But the trash was not exploitative. It evolved from the way certain people are in the world, and you thank fortune that not everybody is like that so our existence doesn't spin totally out of control.",1253232000,6,1624,4.385382059800665
3918310,1,B002EOVXB0,"All these great reviews, including one from AICN, and this movie is pathetic.  The story is unbelievable (even aside from the zombie crap), the characters are unbelievably stupid, and the actors are lame.  I cannot think of anything good to say about this movie.  It's not like I watched it just to watch it.  I watched it because I was really psyched.  What a waste of time.  I almost bought this from the UK because it wasn't being released here quickly enough, but luckily I found it online.  So glad I didn't pay money for it.

The story could be interesting if the characters weren't so disgusting.  People who seemed normal turn out to be twisted freaks and all of the characters make decisions where you're asking yourself ""where is your brain, dude?""

There's nothing redeemable here.  I have no idea why people say it's original when it's just another zombie movie except with using one for sex.  A rotting, fugly, stinking corpse and boys want to have sex with it?  Give me a break.  Good luck if you watch this.  Apparently other reviewers here found something positive in it, so you may wind up liking it (I don't know who these people are, but hopefully I never run into them... cuz they're nuts).",1253059200,14,1210,4.588785046728972
3918311,5,B002EOVXB0,"It's a dark movie that is unlike any you've seen before, pushing over a previously untransgressed line-- immediately appealing to me. This is not a standard scare-flick with basic characters, but depicts how far young men will deviate from the norms of behavior when it comes to the object of their desire. This is a rewarding and highly memorable trip down a rabbit hole to a dark land of horror. The dead girl herself is a stunning presence, and the sound environment is unnerving. If you are into horror, dark fantasy, and taboo subjects, it's essential viewing.  There's no over-explanation through obvious exposition, so there is an air of mystery and unknowing throughout the movie. It is like a surreal element dropped into high-school life that spreads a poison through it, though that poison comes from the minds of the boys, and the dead girl is just a catalyst, though a dangerous one! I'm looking forward to putting this in the DVD player for guests, unsuspecting or otherwise!",1251244800,53,989,4.886904761904762
3918312,4,B002EOVXB0,"I'm trying to think of how to approach this review of Deadgirl, and I cant seem to think of a defining point to make, and I guess thats just because there are so many different ways to take this film. And after having seen this movie about 3 times, Its really left an impression on me as to what an independently made film can really strive to be, if they stick to their morals, and not strive for the stereotypical horror/teen dramedy you see today in theatres lofted out by studios on the weekend to keep them barely in the black.
This really is a great little film to watch with a group of people I've come to find, so if your looking for a movie to watch and have fun with while periodically having you cringe, then I don't see an alternative. The premise to me is not so much original, as it is originally done. And the moral stances presented around the concept are what truly make it stick out. From scene to scene, the dialogue caries the movie in a slow build leading to intense climactic moments that really set this movie apart.  The dialogue is dark, fresh, and relevant; and the characters in the film come from such a place of moral ambiguity, that your left to wonder till the end of how the protagonist/antagonist will finally handle the conflict/blessing with which their faced. This also makes you feel an affinity towards the actors until everyone's chips are cashed.

Highly Recommend",1251158400,8,1404,4.5019607843137255
3918313,4,B002EOVXB0,"In much the same way that Pan's Labyrinth whisks you away to an unfamiliar, dark, and shocking place, Deadgirl will throw a hood over your head and push you down the basement steps. Awesome!",1251072000,2,190,4.617647058823529
3918314,4,B002EOVXB0,"Despite the few plotholes concerning the end of the film, this movie is a very different, very unsettling and a very well acted breath of fresh air to the horror genre. Jenny Spain puts on a remarkable performance in her silent role and the leads were very well cast. I just finished watching the film not 10 minutes ago and the final creepy frame of the movie is stuck in my head and I'm sure will do the same to anyone who sees it. If you're bored with today's watered down PG-13 crap that Hollywood calls ""horror"", check this film out.",1248393600,70,538,4.336633663366337
3918315,1,B002EOVXB0,"I wanted to love this film since the premise behind it is near brilliant.

Two teenage boys go vandalize an abandoned hospital and find a girl tied to a table. One of them decides to make her their private sex slave. The other does not. Then they discover she cannot die (even after one of them shoots her). So they keep her. One teen keeps using her while the other goes on to have conscience problems.

But there are capital problems here that prevent such premise from blooming into a great one-of-a-kind film.

The first thing that strikes me is the miscasting of 25y/o actors who look like 25y/o men and trying to make me believe they are 17y/o teens. That is one major thing that makes this film look quite ridiculous. So you have some 25y/o men dressed as teens and behaving like teens. For me it is hard to buy. I'm sure there are lots of 17y/o teens who would make this film really disturbing.

The second big problem here is the script. It is talky and talky and talky. I have nothing against talky scripts but here I kept asking myself ""won't this film advance to the next scene, please?"". Then I realized this film only had story for 40 minutes. The rest of it was filling the void with slow pace.

Plus, there are lots of implausible storytelling elements that makes the film progressively harder to like. For me this is a film that does not know what it is - and disguises itself as ""Daringly original and genre-busting (...) odyssey into the soul of our alienated youth that takes the conventions of the horror and coming-of-age movies and turns them on their heads"".

No it's not. What it is is a great idea wasted due to a bad Production.",1247875200,28,1655,4.427631578947368

3918325,4,B002EOVXB0,"Not the D-movie horror of the sort that Amazon has peppered throughout their collection. It's not really a horror movie at all, but an incisive feminist film with a victimized zombie subject at the center. That she is beautiful, bound, and nude simply makes her what the movie suggests is the archetypal male fantasy - objectified and something to be possessed. The sex (rape, actually) and nudity are not salacious, but violent, and punctuate the theme of the dehumanizing nature of male fantasy. The filmmakers do not portray any strong or admiral male characters - not even the protagonist (don't be fooled). I only deducted one star for the terminal plot holes, leaving at least three teenagers dead, missing, or undead, without a hint of parental or community concern or involvement. On second thought, that may have been a purposeful exclusion as well.",1489795200,3,858,5.006993006993007

 Some also calls it a horror film. It is not a horror film either although there is a zombie woman in it.
 It is about a human morality and how people can be far from being moral and how inhuman they can be when they see the most vulnerable, toy like figure that they can do whatever they want to do to fulfill their sexual desire as a male.

The story is about two teenagers who accidentally stop by this abandoned hospital and found out that there is a woman who is totally naked covered with vinyle in the underground unit.
 Later they found out that she is dead and is some kind of a zombie figure.
 One guy is Shiloh Fernandez who is kind of shy and even doesn't know how to approach a woman he loves and he doesn't do anything to that dead woman but the other teen Noah Segan ends up with raping that girl whenever he is alone. He uses her as his sex toy.
 She is dead after all for him.
 Then more worse, he brings his friends to that hospital and make them rape her too.
 Figuring out what Noah is doing, Shiloh was not pleased and wanted to stop him.
 He even wanted to release her by cutting her cuff and chains that was there from the beginning when they first saw her.
 But he failed to do so.
 One day the girl that he grown up with who he love but had another boyfriend-Candice King is the girl's name- happens to be abducted by Noah and sees the dead girl.
 Noah wanted to maybe shout the Shiloh's mouth by bringing his one-sided lover and make him have sex just like he is doing to the dead girl.
 But Shiloh is not like Noah and he wanted to release her and wanted to run away with her.
 Then she did mean world to him by saying you should grow up. We are not what we are when we were kids anymore. I have a boyfriend and you are still a childish figure.
 Shiloh is not pleased at all for her words.
 Then the dead girl was released and half kills Noah.
 Noah seeing the girl -Candice- trying to escape, Noah also stabs Candice chest and she is half dead.
 Then. Noah dies.

Later we see Shiloh's happy face in school. He was never like that before.
 So what happened?
 We see that he collected the girl of his dream-Candice- as his next dead girl. Only this time she is wearing decent clothes.

This is a strange stroy about what is really humane and what can be made as human being. How far can a human can go if they are seriously screwed by sexual desire when seeing a woman like figure that they think they can do whatever they can.

There is this touch of zombie which I personally think is maybe not necessary or maybe not.
 But above all it is something that people should experience as a new movie somehow. It is not all crazy story.
 You will have a chance to think while watching it.
 It is not an erotic movie either.

3918383,1,B002EOVXB0,"Two high school misfits decide to go hang out, drink beer and trash a vacant mental hospital.  While in the place, they stumble upon a woman who's naked and strapped to a table.  Is she dead?  No.  Is she alive?  No.  She's a zombie.  A naked, sweaty, zombie with a supermodel body.  Sooooo.... what do you suppose a couple of teenaged guys do with a woman in this situation?  Yes, you're right.  And then they start having their buddies come see her.  The subject matter -- necrophilia -- is disgusting.  The acting and character development are worse.  I didn't finish the movie because it is just trash.  Poorly acted, poorly written, vicious trash, clearly made to shock and disgust anyone with a sense of decency.  The woman is shot, beaten, and raped repeatedly, and is portrayed as mutely enjoying all of the brutal treatment the kids dish out.  You can't quite disregard the revolting subject matter by saying, ''She's a zombie.''  Why?  Because when you put the zombie factor aside, crap like ""Deadgirl'' can serve to provide ideas to people who're already deranged.  The news is full of real-life stories of women who've been held as sexual captives, sometimes for decades.  The people who conceived this movie probably threw the zombie factor in so that the film wouldn't be rated X, although it should have been.  ""Deadgirl'' is little more than big budget, violent, rough porn.  A truly reprehensible movie.",1461110400,15,1420,4.829166666666667

3918405,4,B002EOVXB0,"There's a reason why so many horror films involve high school-aged characters (even if the actors themselves rarely look anything of the sort). Sure, there's the fact that younger actors, often horribly inexperienced, come cheap and keep films under budget, but horror so often has to do what we don't know about ourselves, what we could stoop to if pressed.
This film disturbingly asks what a couple of high school boys would do if they found a naked, undead woman chained to a table in the basement of a hangout spot. Considering the genre, you'd be right to think the results aren't good, but it does offer an uncomfortable look at the myth of boys being boys, which is of course more a childish need to possess and dominate than anything. Old friends Rickie and JT of course plunge to the lowest depths they can but then take different paths. JT explores his darkness in the name of manhood, but Rickie proves more confused, not really in a heroic way, But again remember the genre that we are in. Offering more disturbance than resolution at the end, this film proves to be oddly fascinating.",1450483200,,1097,4.65979381443299

***

Know this before all else. This is a film that deals with the subject of rape in a way that is both serious and seriously disturbing. If you have any serious squeamishness about this subject, or about disturbing violence and sexuality, leave this film alone.

***

It wasn't until my second viewing that I realized this film is a piece of art house horror every bit as original and frightening as David Lynch's Blue Velvet. That's not to say it's a Lynchian movieit has a much more grounded and understated style. The adolescent characters are, to me, absolutely believable, as is the violent and unforgiving social structure of the high school they attend.

While it is in no way lighthearted, there are tiny barbs of jet-black wit, as when a sub-literate jock writes on a locker door, ""YOU'RE DEAD, FAGET!"" or the scene where a gas-station hooker beats the stuffing out of two teenage boys who want to abduct her, which, in the context of this film, is a gratifying moment of womanly victory in a movie that is primarily about the evil misogynistic men are capable of carrying out on females.

***

This movie is both an effective, straight-forward horror with a premise that is, as far as I can tell, completely original, and at the same time a chillingly honest allegory for the perversion of those who do treat women as mere sex objects. Noah Sagan's JT develops into a truly frightening sociopath, and Shiloh Fernandez's Rickie is a nuanced anti-hero as darkly troubled as Kyle MacLachlan's Jeffry Beaumont.",1429401600,8,1536,4.795454545454546

3918479,5,B002EOVXB0,"A very dark look into human nature, particularly that of young men. There's an interesting trend in the evolution of the ""bad guy"" in video games and media. For a time, it was politically correct, perhaps even morally right to kill Nazis, in video games, literature, and movies (Indiana Jones, anyone?). After all, they were deplorable, evil people, right? And then it was the Soviets with Bond, James Bond, and his MI-6 support team. Every now and then we'll also see demons, aliens, whatever they may be.

The problem with all of these antagonists is that there remains a moral conundrum: these are all sentient beings who should be afforded agency and dignity. To us, they may have been evil, but to themselves and to their allies, they were in the right and we were in the wrong.

To solve this moral quandary, zombies were created as enemies. Where is the immorality in ""killing"" something that is already dead? Of course, nowadays we have TV shows and other media pushing this idea to the limit. The Walking Dead sees main characters hacking ""walkers"" into bits and smashing them into puddles of liquid. This plays with the idea of desecrating one's corpse, but in the end, they're dead and trying to eviscerate and eat you.

This movie pushes the envelope to an extreme. Is it morally right to rape a zombie, something that is not even conscious? Is the zombie woman no different from a silicone sex doll, or does she have some level of awareness and, thus, sentience?

The movie has a pretty disturbing ending, not one we didn't see coming, but quite unsettling nonetheless, given the above discussion.",1413072000,4,1610,4.759856630824372

Please, for the love of anything and anyone you hold dear, absolutely ""run away"" from this piece of DRECK! The very fact that it remains ""Unrated"" should be sufficient to place you on alert that there is something weird about the film.

First, and foremost, this piece of movie garbage deals with women as literally and figuratively, pieces of meat. As if that is not enough to ""run away"" from this garbage the story is misogynous to the extreme. The hatred that the writers have toward women as displayed here much make them a danger to people around them. At the same time, the film attempts to cloak itself in the mumbo-jumbo of male teenage angst as an excuse for the worse excesses of an immature mind that very few could imagine.

Next, the writers of this DRECK need to be banned from the light of day in film making and assigned to the lowest level of filth production possible.

I cannot fathom what the ""actors"" expect to do to excuse themselves in the future from having participated in the making of this garbage but it may necessitate them having to undergo plastic surgery so no one will recognize them as they grow older!

As for AMAZON having included this DRECK in their available movies, they should be ashamed and whoever recommended including it should be awarded the ""chump of the year"" award.

The execution of the premise was so vile that it was hard to buy into the motivations of the characters.  Even for the horniest teen boy, sex with someone unappealingi.e. dirty, smelly, coldis still sex with someone unappealing.  Few people seek sex without regard to objectionable physical characteristics.

With the zombie completely immobilized for the majority of the film, there was no mounting danger, just a redundant revisiting the same gross scene.  While this might be meant to comment on an aspect(s) of human sexuality, it flat out failed.  What little damsel in distress that the film did muster felt tacked on and contrived to lead to the predictable final outcome.  Rather than providing any satisfying tension, thrill or even repulsion, Deadgirl completely sickens the way spending an hour and a half sitting in the desert sun drinking warm buttermilk might turn ones stomach.

I for one am glad that this film was made. I thought that the focusing of the coming-of-age motif toward the subjects of masculinity and sociability was furthered by the juxtaposition of the psychology of a sentimental youth.

This is NOT a great film inasmuch as it has some gaping plot holes and stretches of credulity. Release date is 2008, focuses on high schoolers, and not a cell phone in sight. Almost no mention or showing of even the implication of an internet. And then there are the plot issues....you'll be able to pat yourself on the back pointing them out. There are many.

On the surface, it is a creepy look at a mysterious ""dead girl"" in the forgotten basement of an old asylum and how several dysfunctional teens deal with the situation.  On a deeper level, it touches on rape, objectification of women, high school, coming of age, etc, all without distracting the viewer or broadcasting the subtle messages with a heavy hand.  Nice.

Yes, taking advantage of chained-up zombie women is appalling, but so is chopping people to bits with an axe.  Also, sure, the characters did some things that made no sense. To that I ask did it make sense when Mary Poppins flew around using an umbrella?  Its a movie, take it for what it is and roll with it.  When someone throws this one into the player they should not be expecting a monkey playing basketball, it is what it is.

  Things I liked - the way it was shot, the soundtrack, most of the characters and their brooding countenances or creepy vibes. I liked the setting and even the general plotline. While I raised a brow at the main crux of the tale - the treatment of the ""Deadgirl""  I went with it and enjoyed the movie. I also looked past some of the unrealistic ways these kids were acting, but then again read the paper daily and you will see there are a lot of kids acting off-kilter.  Best thing for me is by the last 10 minutes i was rooting for a particular curtain close on this one, and it ended basically how I had hoped, with a bit more of an artistic touch to it. Job well done there.

  So yeah, this one is creepy and to some amoral, but again - all kinds of crazy things are going on in the slipcases of horror films. The movie is supposed to elicit a semblance of disgust along with suspense - its not like they tricked anyone into it, it pretty much tells you on the box or in this myriad of reviews.

This is a zombie movie, and to my knowledge it's the first zombie movie with the courage to explore an important question: if zombies were real, wouldn't some people want to keep a hot zombie as a sex slave?

In this case, horny teenage boys find a beautiful woman, with the usual zombie attributes, chained to a table in an abandoned hospital. I'd like to say hilarity ensues, but this movie takes itself way too seriously. The hero is broody, the villain turns into a cartoon, the direction is too dramatic, the dialogue is immature, the characters make implausible decisions to advance the plot, and the plot choices are either predictable or dumb. One sign of bad writing is that a gun appears early in the movie and never reappears in the violent conflicts at the end.

""Deadgirl"" has an interesting premise...Two, ostracized high schoolers stumble upon a deadgirl/zombie chained in the basement of an abandoned building. With their stereotypical pre-occupation about sex, which is totally unattainable to them, they now have a girl that they can control rather than a girl controlling them. Of course one kid has a conscience and the other becomes corrupted by the scenario. The moral issues  and disintegrating relationship beteen the two made for proper entertainment. This is where the movie should have maintained the focus.

The problem with the movie is that it portrayed all males as raping pigs and females as concubines. The tone of the film was extremely misgynistic therefore making the film devoid of any morality or conscience.

3918549,4,B002EOVXB0,"""Every generation has it's story of the horrors of growing up""

The tagline itself speaks volumes for the movie itself. Deadgirl is an interesting, if not twisted take on the ""coming of age"" story. I'll try to be brief in summary of the story. T.J & Rickie are two high school seniors who spend their days watching the girls they wish they could get, especially Joann, the center of Rickie's affection.

Things change for the boys when they decide to skip school one evening to have some drinks at an abandon asylum. While exploring the underground tunnels of the asylum, the boys come across a locked off room. Upon entering they discover her - Deadgirl. At first glance the boys mistake her for a corpse and Rickie is ready to walk away from the whole thing, but they soon discover that Deadgirl is alive. T.J discusses the possibility of keeping her, at which point he and Rickie get into an argument. After a brief struggle the boys go their separate ways. A few days go by and T.J approaches Rickie, distraught. He convinces Rickie to come back to the asylum to reveal a secret about the girl they found. There Rickie learns the reason for T.J's distress, that despite any amount of bodily harm done to Deadgirl, she cannot die. What follows is a gritty, dark tale of moral conflict for Ricky and a gradual downward spiral for T.J as the two come to terms with their relationship with Deadgirl.

This movie is most definitely NOT for everyone. The movie deals with a lot of dark subject matter, including rape and necrophilia. If you're easily offended by these things then this movie should be avoided, but if you can get past the gross-out factor, you'll find a deeply thought out film that is well worth a watch.

A quick note on the product itself. It arrived in pristine condition as promised, and quickly, too. I ordered this movie on the 4'th of June in anticipation for my friend visiting on the 9'th. I got it within 3 days of ordering. I couldn't have been more pleased.",1344988800,4,1985,4.567415730337078

But then it starts showing us this bizarre progression of events... and the odd part is that I actually cared a little about two of the Characters: The Dead Girl and Ricky (one of the guys who seems like he might have a redeeming quality or two).

I'm trying to convey my reaction to this movie, but it's hard to do.  I'm a bit disturbed.  And the fact that I want to know a bit more about what happened afterward says I must have cared at least a bit.  But I'm also disappointed in characters, and I find myself not feeling very happy.

The production values are good, and I appreciate the effort they put into it.

Last bit to mention: Jenny Spain (the Dead Girl) spends every scene she's in nude.

If this review seems unfocused and vague... well... that's probably a good representation of my reaction to the movie.  Use that information as you see fit for deciding whether to see it.",1344384000,2,996,4.364130434782608

And what about the dog? Did it become an undead immortal?

3918552,5,B002EOVXB0,"Right away we are introduced to some high school delinquent--Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez; from the upcoming reboot of The Evil Dead) and JT (Noah Segan; Cabin Fever 2).  Bored while skipping school, they trespass their way into an abandoned mental hospital, drink, smoke and vandalize; essentially earning themselves an unfortunate fate by any horror standard.  Wandering unadvisably deep into the unsafe building they make their way to a long rusted-shut room in the lower corridors in which they find ""a dead girl.""

The dynamic between Rickie and JT is decently played.  Although besties at initial face value, this thin veil is quickly drawn when JT becomes violently possessive of their ""dead girl.""  Naked, gagged, restrained and wrapped in plastic on as gurney--oh, right, and in a room rusted-shut and years (if not decades) separated from the world--the girl shows indications of somehow being alive.  After some destitute acts, the moral bankruptcy of both boys gradually becomes apparent, even if Rickie maintains the slightly higher moral ground throughout the story.  Interestingly, we also learn that this girl seemingly can't die.

As the mute ""dead girl,"" new-comer Scream Queen Jenny Spain produces some truly awkward, hauntingly pain-wracked, even quite disturbing (when not brilliantly menacing or unnerving) expressions.  We find everything from hatred and fear to utter pandemonium in her eyes.  On the down side, the film's supporting roles are weak, even unnecessary.  While many scenes take place at the boys' high school or home, this could have been presented much more effectively as an extended one-act since all of the significant character development occurs, or could occur, in the abandoned mental hospital.

3918555,5,B002EOVXB0,"I had this film recommended to me by someone I know and trust.  The recommender is NOT a ""horror film fan"" and made it clear that this was a disturbing film.  So, I waited a while to watch it.

Let's be clear up-front.  This is a difficult movie to watch.  It is not happy, it is not fun, and it is not full of adventure.  It is, however, deeply emotional and deeply moral.  It is, in the end, a modern example of the classical ""fairy tale"" concept.

The classical fairy tale has NOTHING to do with the modern ""Disney-fied"" concept we think of most often today.  Fairy tales were set in the real world and contemporary period (or at least the real world as understood by the audience who the story was created for, and in their own timeframe).  The target audience was intended to be able to imagine themselves, in their own ordinary lives, encountering this situation.

Such a story was seldom ""happy"" and as often as not was dark, violent, and had an unhappy ending for the story's characters (even Goldilocks was eaten by the bears, after all).  These stories were told to make moral points...  creating situations that the audience might never have encountered but would make that audience CONSIDER what it would be like to be faced with the sort of moral choices or matters of judgment which the story presented.  If you make the right choice... yes, you can ""live happily ever after"" but if you don't, things go very , very badly.

That's what this movie is all about.  It's a fictionalized, fantasy-ized FAIRY TALE about two people who are faced with a moral situations which tests their nature... and the two very different directions they could take... and how the wrong choice, or even failing to make the right choice up-front, can both lead to very, very bad consequences.

The characters in this film are all there to play archetypical roles.

The lead character, Ricky, represents most of us, frankly...  and is there for us to view the movie's world through.  We see his choices... both good, bad, and ""never really made at all,"" and we see the consequences of his choices.

At the outset of the movie JT, the other ""lead"" is almost indistinguishable from Ricky, except that he's slightly more self-assured, less self-doubting.  If anything, he seems more appealing at first.  But as the movie progresses, you see that this ""appealing"" characteristic is actually the tip of an iceberg, just under the surface, which he learns to let out as the movie progresses.  Much like how, except for a twist of fate, a man might have been a marginally successfully Austrian house painter, but instead gained a degree of power and chose to let his inner darkness out, bringing about some of the best known evils in modern history.

Other characters are also archetypes.

There is the ""weak henchman"" who seems very neutral at first but eventually ceases to even be human...  almost like a ""lesser demon"" to JT's almost Satanic behavior (including his efforts to tempt Ricky into joining his cause)

There is the ""bully"" character who leads Ricky into making his first real step along the ""morality is flexible"" road.  It's hard for a viewer to NOT agree, at the time we're watching, with how Ricky deals with this character... though upon reflection, you realize that it was his own bad choices which led to that inevitable result.

There is the ""object of unrequited love"" who at first seems sympathetic but eventually proves to be less human than the titular ""dead girl,"" but who Ricky never ceases to virtually worship, even as she mocks him for his devotion.

And, of course, there is the title character herself, the (never named) ""dead girl.""  We never learn who she is, but I, at least, WANT to know.  She is, in the end, the most sympathetic character in the film... the only one whose fate seem to be unrelated to any choices on her part.  And the one time when she actually DOES have a choice...  let's just say it's one about a door, or Ricky...  near the end of the film, her choice is very, very interesting, and in no way what would be expected from a ""Zombie.""

Is she a ""Zombie?""  That's debatable.  She's clearly not ""fully human"" anymore but we don't know how, or why, she became this way, or how she ended up in that basement.  She is, simply, a ""victim.""  That there are ways that those who prey upon her can justify doing so... ie, that she's ""not human""...  is not something which is PRAISED in the film, but rather is shown for the evil it truly is.  Real-life sexual predators view women in much the same way that JT and others in this film view her...  and those caught up in the fringes of that life, as Ricky is in this film, may try to do the right thing, but may be torn between ""their friends"" and even their whole life as they know it, and this moral choice.

Who is she?  All I know about her for certain is that she's an iconic presentation of the purely innocent victim, subjected to dehumanization and misfortune which are not her choice... and the only choice she gets to make in the entire film occurs at the end... and is VERY significant.

I want to know more about her... who she was... who she IS.  I've known real women who have been put through similar (if non-fictional) situations, and have managed, over time, to recover and ""become human"" again.  I see this character as a fictional stand-in for every victim of sexual predation, confinement, and dehumanization who's ever lived.  She's not a ""monster"" at all... and if you expect for her to be the stereotypical movie zombie, you're going to hate this film.  She's the victim who eventually triumphs over her captors...  and any ""zombi-ism"" is primary there as a catalyst for explaining the way that her captors treat her as being less than human, which is something which could not be done in a conventional film, as the audience could never, even for an instant, be able to see the pure socioopathy of JT or his stoner henchman, or of the two jocks, otherwise, without rejecting it utterly.

This is a movie about sociopathy.  It's a morality tale about consequences of choices, or of LACK of choices for that matter.  It uses zombie-ism only as a means to convey to non-sociopathic audience members how the sociopaths see the world, without causing those non-sociopathic to entirely shut down.

Ricky is not a sociopath.  JT is.  Ricky's object of attention is a narcisist.  The two jocks are also sociopaths, but in a different way than JT...  they're compensating for different things in their lives.  Ricky is a victim, in a sense, but he could make the right decision at any time, and only at the end does he try to do so...  and by then, it's too late to fix everything, and there are inevitable consequences.  He may be ""broken"" at the end but he's still acting from a moral, if somewhat twistedly so, perspective.

If you go into this movie looking for a fun viewing experience, you will be disappointed. If you want a ""resident evil"" type horror adventure, you're wasting your time.  This is a pure psychologically-grounded morality tale...  and very much a fairy tale in the classical sense.  Watch it, from that perspective, and you can enjoy it and even learn from it.  Watch it for any other reason, and you're likely to be offended or disgusted...  or, if you're a sociopath yourself, perhaps for titilation value.

I enjoyed the film for the morality tale aspects of it...  but was utterly repulsed by the actions of the various characters.  As the makes of the film clearly intended.

This film shows evil...  and how evil has consequences.  We all know people like Ricky, who ""go along"" with evil to avoid losing something we hold dear, but we know that this never works out well in the end.  We all know people like JT, who may seem ""OK"" as long as they have no real power, but who will let all their inner demons out at the first opportunity once they have any form of power over anyone (say, for instance, their children, as often happens in real life) and who, if given real power, would bring about evil on a much, much larger scale.  We all know people like the two jocks... and we can (and should) find ourselves reflecting on our own feelings about what befalls them... is it ""justice"" or is it morally wrong?  We all know, and in many cases have felt similarly to Ricky about, someone like his ""unrequited love"" and have seen how destructive such people can be in our lives, unless we learn to let go and see them for what they really are (a lesson which Ricky, unfortunately, never does learn in this film).

This is a morality tale... a cautionary tale...  but it's not a ""fun"" movie nor ""entertaining"" in the conventional sense.  Go into it understanding that, and you can see the worth of this film.  Go into it expecting to be entertained...  to feel good afterwards and to not have to think or reflect... and you'll hate it.

A. A handful of stereotypes
B. Trapped inside a house/fort/shopping mall surrounded by zombies
C. So they betray each other and are picked off one by one

3918559,5,B002EOVXB0,"Tired of watching the crusty-old formulaic Hollywood type of plots, overrated actors and unnecessary hype???

Dare to step out of your comfort zone and watch this film.

I will not delve into the story since that would ruin it for those who have yet to watch it. However, after reading the reviews of this film, I have a feeling that when writing about the main characters's choices, people seem to distance themselves from the psychological crossroads JT and Rickie face, blaming their poor choices on their untamed sexual urges of adolescence or on their poorly lit future before society.

I beg to differ. Biology and social strata do mater but people, rich and poor, young and old all delve into these fantasies, which many would probably act upon if allowed by society. I just find it interesting and felt compelled to share my opinion on what I have read so far.

This is a well-crafted, well-acted, original coming of age psychological thriller. It kind of reminds of a French film called ""Merci Pour le Chocolat' or ""Nightcap"" as titled in English.",1334448000,,1056,4.81767955801105
3918560,4,B002EOVXB0,"I'm going to try to do this without spoilers.

You have to look at ""Deadgirl"" beyond its face value.  It's an allegory. It takes place on the dark fringes of teen male sexuality.  It's about insecurity, lust, peer pressure, control, and sex-related angst.  All of it was taken to an extreme, but that's what horror movies do.  The titular character was a symbol of hormonal madness and sexual dysfunction.  She was attractive and disgusting, dirty but alluring.  Each male she interacted with approached her differently, and each approach reflected his own sexual hang-ups.  She only interacted with one female, and when the two collided everything went wrong.  It's like the guy who has only learned about sex through porn finally coming into contact with a real woman and trying to apply what he's ""learned,"" resulting in disaster.

People who write this off as simple gore porn have missed the mark. There is very little gore at all in this movie. Calling the movie misogynistic or pro-rape is inaccurate.  None of the abuse of women was portrayed in a favorable light.  It was very ugly and not sexy or funny at all.  You have to remember that there's a difference between subject matter and advocating the subject. If anything, this had a more anti-male feel to it, since every single guy in the story was a bully, a rapist, a drunk, or a doormat.  Lastly, the sex and violence in this movie is not gratuitous.  Unless you're from the school of thought that dictates all sex and violence in film is unnecessary, it's pretty plain to see that this story simply could not exist without sex and violence.

I'm giving this movie 4 stars.  The story was great. From a technical standpoint, this movie was brilliantly shot and edited. What special effects there were were awesome (FANTASTIC make-up).  The acting was above-average. The two male leads were good, but the supporting characters came off a little wooden.  Also, some events in the story seemed a little forced.

3918562,1,B002EOVXB0,"I watched this movie with the idea that I wasn't going to be all that impressed with the acting but with the hopes that the story would be something interesting and different. I was right about one thing and my hopes were dashed with the other.  This movie starts off with two outcast kids going to visit an abandoned asylum with papers and whatnot thrown everywhere for some reason.  You always see these official documents laying around in movies so I wasn't too bummed about that.  Anyway in the sub cellars or whatever they find a guard dog who is there for no reason and a girl who is covered in plastic and left for however long but she's still alive...more or less.  So what's the first thing you decide to do when you find someone held captive in an asylum for years?  Right, Rape her.  This was carried out in the most lame way possible.  Dork ""B"" says something along the lines of ""hey Dork A, I'm lonely, can you go so I can get it on with this girl?"" and Dork A says something like ""why? You shouldn't. okay, I'll go"" and wanders off.

Anyway there is a lot of pointless rape and assault in this movie with a paper thin plot supplemented with a super weak outcast/cheerleader love story that does nothing for the movie until the end (which is predictable but could be worse so I won't give it away).  Oh yeah and there is a Mom's Boyfriend in the movie that is about as pointless of a character as you will ever see. He is as useless as Ben Affleck.

But why did I give this a one star?  I wasn't disturbed by the movie, there are a ton of movies out there that have twisted plots and if you can allow yourself to be disturbed by this stay away from movies like Martyrs, Human Centipede, and Taxadermia and what not.  This wasn't too disturbing, it was wrong what they were doing but it is to be expected in horror movies nowadays.  They don't try to creep you out as much as they do gross you out.  My problem was they explained nothing.  They didn't say why the girl was there, who she was, what was wrong with her.  They just had some dumb teenagers stumble across her and violate her.  I dozed off a few times during this on a Sunday afternoon so maybe in my 10 minutes of sleep I missed something that would have turned everything around for me but I doubt it.  I think this movie could have been interesting but I think it failed on nearly every level.

3918570,1,B002EOVXB0,"I purchased this film based on a movie review score (I did not read the detail, to avoid any spoilers, but man I wish I had).  I was hoping that this would be a plesant surprise like ""Let the Right One in"".  I will say that the High Def quality of the picture was good; however, this was a terrible film to watch.  It was not a 'horror' or zombie film (which was what I was expecting), but would qualify as a zombie mini-porn movie, where to outcast high school students discover a chain up zombie girl and one repeatedly rapes her, and the other moves between wanting to forget that they found her and letting her go.  The rapist of course has to invite a 3rd friend to join in the filth, and of course he lets the cat out of the bag.  There was no humor, there was no plot, there was no purpose, but there was an attractive woman who played the zombie (if that is your thing).  The only thing I thought was, I felt genuine sorrow and pity for the woman who had to play that part, as she clearly deserves a better lot in life than that.

I'm glad that I was able to trade in this movie for some Amazon credit to get some of my money back at least, and I'll never listen to that web sites reviews again.",1317772800,7,1203,4.050632911392405

Without giving away crucial parts of the film I can tell you that what drives this film is the interaction of some guys over a ""dead girl"" they find chained up in an abandoned, boarded up mental hospital. She's gorgeous, in a Morticia sort of way and naked and, well, kind of a zombie. Well, boys will be boys and the natural things ensue but this chick is far from natural. The actors act their parts believably even when they are being incredibly stupid. Worth a watch and the ending has a satisfying twist.

3918572,1,B002EOVXB0,"To call this movie depraved is a huge understatement. It starts with a disgusting premise and then reaches nauseating depths of inappropriateness, offensiveness, and absurdly aggressive misogyny without ever actually becoming a scary movie. I am all for twisted movies, psychological terror, even blood and gore which is typical for zombie movies, but this one is just plain sick - but in a really clinically demented way, not in an intriguing dark zombie/horror movie way.

The premise of the movie is neither clever nor scary - it is just plain disturbing -  going down a route one should never see another human being go - not even in jest for a movie: a couple of high school kids break into an abandoned mental institution and find a zombie girl they first brutally stab, beat and maim and then tie to a bed in the basement to regularly rape. Disturbing is great, especially in this genre, but not when accompanied by this much vile, unfounded violence and unspeakable acts of brutality. Of course the subdued message here is that rape and brutalizing are ok as long as they are being committed against ""lesser"" creatures or in this case, a zombie. The writers, apparently quite in tune with the level of depravity that they describe, seem to have missed that it is not whom the act is committed against that makes it unconscionable but the fact *that* it is committed in the first place.

I have a high tolerance for terrifying and morally ambiguous movies of all kind but this one just went too far. Rape and forced captivity are simply unconscionable in the nature of most human beings that are capable of coherent thought, and said actions are generally not tolerated by most people in any society and any culture. Yet you have a series (not just one or two) of young adolescents commit acts so dark that calling them heinous would be stating it mildly. The horror elements are almost secondary in this case. They could have easily found a victim of head trauma in an abandoned house or a paraplegic or a mentally retarded individual and the movie wouldn't have changed much.

I wonder why any studio or distributor would choose to endorse it. I really think the writers need to be taken in for psychological evaluation. This piece of garbage is not creative or art, it is the product of a pathological and twisted mind in need of some serious therapy and a partial lobotomy if you ask me. This is an absolutely wretched movie that takes depravity to new heights. Anyone who enjoys this mindless, despicable, sociopathic rape fest should seriously consider therapy and all the professional help they can get.",1315699200,20,2617,4.757709251101321

Again, of course it is disgusting, but again, that is the point of the movie. Is it your standard gore-fest horror movie? No. That's why a lot of horror-movie fans do not like this movie. Why? Because it makes you think and most horror movie fans don't want to think about what's going on the screen. Plus it hits too close to home for the many teen-age losers who waste their time watching gory horror films. It is a look into the minds of a couple of typical teen-age, goofball slackers who find what they consider to be a god-send in the shape of a naked zombie girl strapped to a gurney. This is the best thing that has ever happened to the two total losers who are the main characters. They don't care about the morals of the situation. They don't care about the girl. They don't even care that much about the sex. Its the concept of having this ""treasure"" that is important to them. A treasure that they can control and use and show off and generally do with what they want. For the first time in their miserable lives, these low-lifes are actually in control and they run with it. Conflicts arise with one of them has a crisis of conscience and thinks that maybe they should put a stop to the entire affair. The raping is a metaphor for their destructive approach to everything they do. They are a couple of lost-souls who make all the wrong decisions all the time.

3918577,4,B002EOVXB0,"Deadgirl was a horror film that came out in 2008 that pretty much fell under the radar, and thats a shame since it's creepy as hell. The film was directed by Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel who both had a couple films under their belts and came up with a masterpiece with this one. (They are also currently in the works on a movie called Murk.) It was written though by Trent Haaga who not only written a few movies but has acted in quite a few as well.

The film opens with two best friends (who happen to be quickly shown as the unpopular kids) deciding to skip class. These two, J.T. (Noah Segan) and Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez) end up going to a mental asylum to explore and when they are getting ready to leave stumble across the dead body of a woman. She is strapped to the bed, naked, and suddenly opens her eyes. Dead isn't the exact word for what she is after all though living doesn't describe it either.

While Rickie wants to let the girl go, J.T. talks him into keeping her tied down. Accidentally it's found out that she cannot die though clearly does not have enough intelligence to communicate with them as she acts more like a wild animal than anything else. While they both agree to keep the secret of what they have, and Rickie doesn't say anything, it is clear that a few other people end up finding out about the dead girl. As J.T. has been talking to others about what he has a few others have been paying him to get a piece of her as well.

This is where we mix in the fact that Rickie has a girl that he is in love with. While he is trying to woo the woman he loves we flash to seeing J.T. ever increasing what he does with his undead captive. J.T. clearly has more issues than originally thought as he starts to mix violence with sex and keeps pushing the boundaries wondering what he can get away with. As their opinions on women divide them even further between each other it leads to a climax of the film that is unfortunately predictable. While the ending is actually filmed extremely well it was hard to not see it coming from a mile away.

While the premise is clearly something to creep anyone out (multiple guys deciding to have sex with an undead girl) the film tries to mix humor with the horror. When it comes to trying to tackle a subject of tackling raping the undead, a coming of age story, a teen romance, and a sex comedy? It just doesn't work. The premise if it stuck to just the horror aspect may have been too much for more audiences but would have kept the film from being lowered into something that wasn't fully enjoyable for a failed mixing of genres instead of going ""too far. Deadgirl had a lot of potential with a plot that could have pushed the limits of what we feel comfortable watching but instead turned what should have been a graphically and mentally twisted film into something that, while graphic, fell short. It's hard for me to decide how I feel on this one as I loved the actual premise but felt the side-plots ruined the film.",1301788800,2,2988,4.3113879003558715

The storyline is original, unfortunately it is also completely predicatable. Also, I watched this movie because I was expecting a horror/suspense film, but there was no terrifying moments and very little suspense.

3918583,4,B002EOVXB0,"Misfits Rickie and JT decide to skip school and drink beer in an abandoned insane asylum. After taking out their teen angst on the place, they incur the wrath of a guard dog. They narrowly escape it deep in the bowels of the building and find a room that's been sealed for a long time. In that room, they find something that will change their lives forever: a dead girl tied to a gurney and wrapped in plastic. They soon find out that she is alive, but extremely savage and seemingly immortal. JT wants to take advantage of having a nude, helpless female lying around, while Rickie feels quite the opposite. When word gets around and more people get involved, Rickie and JT embark in a power struggle that spins out of control and leads to an unexpected and dark resolution.

I just want to start by saying this is a very polarizing film: you'll either love it or despise it. The film as a whole is hard to watch because of the nonchalance the characters have with their own horrific actions. It's really chilling how calmly JT describes how he raped, beat, and attempted to kill the woman multiple times. He seems to think that it's ok because he sees her as being less than an animal. Zombies are usually the monsters in works of fiction, but in this case, it's the teenage boys that are infinitely more monstrous. Human nature can be an ugly and savage thing when out of the gaze of society.

These boys have discovered a world where they are the supreme rulers. They don't have to follow the rules or accept that they are pathetic losers who will contribute nothing to the real world. In this world, they always get the girl and call the shots. It's the ultimate fantasy for them. Their world is completely removed from reality, in a dark, dank basement that is the polar opposite of reality in almost every way. I hate the characters. They are pathetic excuses for human beings, but I can see where they come from: a place where no one cares what happens to them and where they have no future. It's a great character piece where I don't agree at all with them and I think they are horrible and stupid, but understand them just the same. That's the mark of great story telling.

Rickie is the only male character with any sort of promise. The others are satisfied to get sexual gratification from a mute, unaware woman than have a real, healthy, consensual relationship. Rickie still isn't completely innocent because he knows that what his friends are doing is wrong, but he hesitates to do something about it. He seems to be torn between resigning himself to the emotionless situation with the dead girl or attempting to make a real human connection with a living, breathing classmate. This film is kind of a sick and twisted coming of age story.

The woman being used and raped in this film is a zombie. This fact doesn't make her any less of a victim. Society in general objectifies women in the advertising and the media all the time. Women are frequently equated to objects or animals and shown as inherently inferior to men. Sometimes I find myself desensitized against such advertising because it's so pervasive and we as a society see literally thousands of advertisements each day. This general environment can make it easy for some to internalize this sexist thinking and go even further to say that anything can justifiably be done to them. The woman's rapists distance themselves from her by thinking of her as less than them, less than human. This film holds up a mirror to our society and makes us see the ugliness within it.

This is a powerful and uncomfortable film to watch. It's well produced, written, and acted. Jean Spain gives a wonderful performance as the Deadgirl and manages to make her both sympathetic and dangerous without even speaking. A lot of you probably wouldn't like this movie, but if you like dark films that deal with the horror within humanity then this is probably the movie for you.",1297468800,111,3930,4.600570613409415

At some point, you may think that the characters are going through a phase because they are in high school.  But, honestly, all the characters display mental issues, home life problems, and basically it's really about their morals and knowing the difference between right and wrong.  The rape scenes are quite disturbing if you analyze it from a humanistic and moral standpoint but if you can't then, eh, it's just a movie.  There is NO explanation as to why this girl is dead and still alive.  It's not that she's even a zombie needing Brains for dinner.  I assumed she was part of some type of experiment gone wrong which left her ""dead-ish"".  The ending was a bit cheesy, I wish it didn't end that way.

3918585,4,B002EOVXB0,"Deadgirl is a modest budgeted oddity that is held together almost entirely by its rather unwholesome premise. In a nutshell, you have these two highschool misfits who cut class one day, and mess around in the local neighborhood abandoned insane asylum. Every neighborhood has one of these I suppose. Rickie, the Wally Cleaver of this dynamic duo, is the lovesick loser down on his luck type. He's a sullen character who rarely smiles and is continually burdened by his pesky conscience. JT, our Eddie Haskell, has no conscience to speak of, and one quickly gets the feeling that a stiff breeze could push this character over the edge into total wickedness. Just like some kind of urban folklore legend, the pals encounter the dreaded black dog, symbolic in the old country of famine and death. Fleeing from this mongrel is of course what leads them to the real discovery in the basement. It is there that they find a beautiful naked woman lying on her back on a metal table, securely fascened to it by her wrists and ankles. Even more interestingly, she is also incased within a thick clear plastic bag. I think that the creators of this story must of seen the documentary on realistic female silicone love dolls used as substitutes for actual women, because this living dead girl looked like she was all packaged and ready for immediate shipping. It is here that our pals have their conflict. Good old Wally Cleaver wants to notify authorities immediately, and Eddie Haskell wants to keep this nude female zombie as his own personal blow up doll. So JT punches his sulking pal in the face, and Rickie leaves dejected.

Though there are a few intriguing moments amoungst the none-zombie members of the cast, most of their behavior, and most of the drama for that matter, are blatantly stereotypical. For example, since JT is the bad egg in a film who's very premise is teetering on NC-17 anyway, his language is naturally peppered with F-Bombs. He also has to shoulder one of the biggest problems of the plot. The audience already knows that the dead girl is a zombie, but JT has to explain it to Rickie right in front of us anyway. In a vein attempt to comb over this tedious task, the story calls for JT to shoot the zombie in the belly. It comes across as an unnecessary empty gesture. Ultimately, all he did was damage the pristine condition of his sex toy to prove a point.

Wheeler the Squealer.

Then there is the whole thing with Johnny the jock. He is a chisiled jawed muscle bound jerk who's sole purpose for being in the film is for us to hate his guts. To help us hate him even more, he is also shown dating the girl that our long suffering protagonist Rickie is hopelessly in love with. Since Rickie can't keep his eyes off this girl, Johnny the Jock beat him and Rickie's annoying side kick Wheeler up in the school parking lot. The beating borders on attempted murder and is further confounded when Wheeler squeals about the existence of Deadgirl to Johnny. Johnny chooses to take Wheeler on face value, so he commits his second felony of the afternoon, right in front of student onlookers and bus drivers. He kidnaps Wheeler and Ricky by tossing them into the trunk of his car. Even Rickie's love interest is there to see these two crimes take place, but like everyone else who's watching, she does little to stop these felonies, and takes no action to inform the authorities. This whole sequence of events just doesn't work at all, but at least we get to see Johnny get his privates gnawed on by Deadgirl, and his intestines come out his hind parts in the school toilet. None of these events can withstand even the slightest penlight of logic, but it sure is a blast to watch Johnny's demise frame by frame by pressing the pause and fast forward buttons.

Even though the outcome of this film has been foretold a million times over in a million different movies before it, there are still enough things that stand out to make Deadgirl worthwhile. JT is played brilliantly by Noah Segan who seemed to relish in that roll and fill it with a dominating demented presence. It was also a great technical choice to show the gradual yet rapid decay of Deadgirl herself. At first she was almost hot as she arched her back and stretched out her naked torso and ribcage in front of the letcherous eye of the leering camera, but by the end, you didn't want to go anywhere near her. Towards the end of the film, her skin seemed to glisten with the greenish oily residue of her dank crusty basement surroundings. The make up effects where very effective, not just with the blood and decay of Deadgirl, but also with the horrible looking wound she inflicted upon JT's face. It really did look like his upper palate had been eaten off. I also loved the sickly sinister idea JT had of replacing the rabidly decaying body of Deadgirl with some fresh new meat. Since Deadgirl was turning sour, his vile idea was to capture some young hot sweetie and have Deadgirl take a bite out of her. This would infect Deadgirls replacement into become his new and improved zombie sex slave. Of course even a total simpleton has to know that this means Rickie's love interest, but even that shouldn't matter. With a premise like the one in Deadgirl, it's the thought that counts.

3.5 stars.

Lessons learned from watching this feature:
1) If you decide to own your own sex doll, keep it in a cleaner place then the grungy basement of an abandoned insane asylum.
2) Keep the existence of your sex doll to yourself.
3) Being rough with a zombie sex slave greatly enhances ones ability to eat corn on the cob.",1295827200,6,5593,4.582417582417582

Like kids saying, ""Ok, we find a barely living woman chained to a table in a basement.  Let's have sex with her!!""  Maybe some the true sociopathic youth our country breeds, but not many.

Unlike some other reviewers I can perfectly understand why two alienated youths, rejected by their high school classmates, would respond in such a manner after finding the girl. There are too many TRUE examples of this alienated behaviour. My title refers to the end of the flick which I will leave at that so as not to spoil the movie.

3918589,2,B002EOVXB0,"There is a great idea in DEADGIRL.  There is even a great story in DEADGIRL...but they made the movie before it was ready.

The intriguing idea is two dopey teens poking around an abandoned mental hospital discover a naked girl chained down to a table who isn't alive.  But she's not exactly dead either.  But she's hot, for a zombie.  And naked.  You can see the possibilities coming but the film doesn't decided whether it's a horror film or a comic horror film.

In fact, the script doesn't make a lot of decisions that help with the great idea.  Why couldn't the more thoughtful teen dig through the lab to find out who the girl was and how she ended up chained to a table?  The writers indulged the scumbag teen who uses the deadgirl for his own gratification but left the other teen thinly developed and weak.

I admire the filmmakers for independently creating a vision...but the vision wasn't prepped enough to become a professional horror film.  Characters aren't developed, ideas aren't followed through, good ideas are thrown in but then left incomplete.

Better than most of the ""horror"" crap I've seen (certainly more interesting than more popularly-distributed films like HOSTEL or whatever torture porn is hitting the multi-plexes) but...just not there yet.",1292976000,3,1272,4.892523364485982

3918593,3,B002EOVXB0,"If you have low expectations this isn't bad for a cheesy horror flick. It is gory and I wouldn't call it scary but it IS very creepy, gross and disturbing. The movie is about two teenage boys who skip school and go drinking...in a creepy, abandoned mental hospital! In a hidden room they find a chained up, naked ""dead"" girl, only the girl isn't actually dead. She is some kind of zombie that apparantly likes to bite people. She can't talk but she can moan and scream.

For whatever reason, one of the guys decides it is a good idea to sleep with her...and beat her and basically abuse her...As you can probably guess, things don't end well for him. Soon, he finds out that bad things happen to the people she bites. The ending was predictable but witty. I DO however have one big complaint with the movie: We never find out WHAT the dead girl is! Is she a zombie? Is she some evil demon? Is she a vampire? Does she have some crazy disease? Also, how did she get there? They never fully explain this stuff and they don't partially explain it either. Another complaint I have: The acting is decent but a few of the actors look WAY too old to be playing high school kids!

All in all, if you are into cheesy horror this is a decent movie. It could have been scarier and it could have explained more. The good points are the gore and the general creepiness. It also might be a good one for fans of bondage etc. It also manages to do this without really being offensive. The actress is pretty but she is playing a dead zombie-thing, she is covered in nasty body makeup and she doesn't really react to pain or appear to suffer...she just lays there with a blank zombie-gaze and gnashes her teeth every once in a while. I would have liked to see her kick more butt in the movie though. Anyway, this movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I was entertained but probably not entertained enough to watch this again. I give it a three star rating because it did have good gore AND it actually had decent acting for a horror flick.",1286668800,,2027,4.31758530183727
3918594,1,B002EOVXB0,"I love torture flicks, gore, etc. However I also like things like...character development, plot, cohesive storytelling, etc. Deadgirl has none of these things. Sure, teenage boys are horny, but they aren't all sexually deviated psychopaths. JT has no qualms beating, raping, and renting out some random woman they find to class mates, and the movie never eludes why he'd have such behavior (or why Rickie wouldn't have noticed this sooner in his lifelong friend).

Meanwhile Rickie is continuously riddled with teenage angst and dealing with the ""perils"" of suburbia. His mother works all the time while he deals with her lazy, but ""means well"" alcoholic boyfriend. Poor Rickie. It puzzles me why these films never choose protagonists from more interesting backgrounds, or why teenagers are portrayed by actors in their mid-20's. These ""teens"" felt like crude caricatures of teenagers, and came across very ridiculous.

This movie could have an hour sliced from it and you'd miss absolutely nothing. The dialogue is meaningless and utilizes ""man"" before and after every sentence at a staggeringly obnoxious rate. The writer(s) were incredibly out of touch with the age group. The plot is dragged through scenes of Rickie riding his bike, brooding, and eying his high school crush. Seriously? Your class mates are raping a supernatural bondage zombie sex slave, and you're focused on getting the popular girl in school?! Absurd...

Zombies spread by infected bacteria and germs transferred through bodily fluids, like blood and saliva. Therefore it seems completely ridiculous that this group of teens can be fingering her gun sores and having sex without risk of infection. The Deadgirl is very feral, which is why she's tied up. That's ignored when the change her into various sexual positions throughout the movie. Even when people are bitten and turned, we don't see them for the rest of the movie. GREAT plotting. What is this Deadgirl? Why is she undead? Why is JT crazy? Why are other kids OK with raping a zombie? Nothing is answered in this movie. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No foundation, no aim, no destination.

The film would be more entertaining if was campy and gory, but humor is very occasional and conflicts dramatically with everything they build up towards. What a waste. I wasn't disturbed in the least, but my intelligence was insulted. The one thing decent about the whole film is the actress playing ""Deadgirl,"" and she's dead. What does that mean?

Deadgirl tries too hard to shock. It's one of the most incoherent, sloppy, and poorly written films I've ever seen, with more plot holes than I can even convey. But NO--The box says things like ""Brilliant"" and ""Original."" Not Hollywood and low-budget doesn't always equal ""good.""

There's a lot of great zombie flicks, torture porn, and quirky b-movies out there. This isn't one of them.

For good torture movies, check out ""Martyrs,"" ""Inside,"" or ""Frontier(s)"" instead.",1283212800,20,2936,5.129707112970712
3918595,4,B002EOVXB0,"This is one demented mindscrew.  Deadgirl('09) obliterates all expectations while drilling deeper and deeper into the sexual subconscious.  It's an uncomfortable descent into the darkest abyss of human compassion.  It explores themes of guilt and temptation with a dark moral complexity while also balancing vulnerability with invincibility.  Bizarre, original, and totally morbid, this movie has cult status plastered all over it.

Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez) and J.T. (Noah Segan) are two high school buddies that seem to struggle fitting in with the ""cool kids"".  One day they both skip school to hangout and drink some beers at an abandoned insane asylum.  Eventually they stumble upon a presumably dead young woman who is chained naked to a table.  Things get even more crazy as they learn that something about her just doesn't feel quite....human?  Is she a vampire, zombie, or possibly something supernatural?  Questions go unanswered as J.T. contemplates other uses for this exposed, beautiful woman.

This is the kind of American horror film I love to see.  Forget all the lousy remakes or regurgitated popcorn nonsense.  How bout one that actually pushes the boundaries and explores new horrifying territory?  Deadgirl is directed by Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel and written by Trent Haaga.  There are solid acting performances from the cast, plus stellar character development.

I don't discount violence if it is for the sake of an interesting plot or integral for telling a more diverse story, but my opinion is that it just wasn't there in this movie.

It runs a little long...is slow at points, but 15 minutes from its ending, you'll be able to figure out how it ends.  There is a huge flaw, however.  The male lead has a bloody lip from the get-go.  It heals, then festers.  It bleeds, is gone, and comes back again and again.  This was a distraction to me, because it took some of the believability out of the film.  You'll see what I mean.

But maybe I'm just reading too much into it. I originally rented the movie on Netflix, per their suggestion, and was not disappointed.

There are two directors of Deadgirl, important because the movie changes in the middle. At first you think it is doing to be film heavy about depravity and brutality.

But the film goes to black comedy. There are references to Night Of The Living Dead, Heathers, River's Edge--if Deadgirl had been made in 1990, Crispan Glover would have been perfect for the bad boy-all sorts of horror and dark humor conventions.

This works better: from the start there is a nagging implausibility to Deadgirl. A round of bullets is pumped into her but she remains half alive. Why? Search me--I dunno, but search the damn film, it does not know, either.

Deadgirl sometimes being such a sloppy mess, over the top black comedy makes the whole plot easier to assimilate.

Still,  some of the acting is really good. The protagonist is understated, and the actor uses a minimal style letting the action happen around him, and this works.

All of this is a lot of fun, even if this film careens all over the place. Films are like people, and if you like them, you are willing to forgive a lot of flaws.

I like this movie! i tend to prefer sick, twisted movies if they offer up a psych profile or lesson on why people act in sick ways. this movie IS a sort of study of the conflicts that tread on each other in the maturing teenage mind. it's told in an impressive script with good acting on the part of everyone involved. it is a fresh horror movie from a slightly askew angle that can be enjoyed purely from a teenage, fun horror/party movie...but it can also offer up an analytical view of kids who face this girl who is not quite dead...a girl who still has some chilling lessons of her own to dish out to these kids who have a lot to learn. this movie is sick in spots. it's not for everybody. it's definitely indie, but still a worthwhile flick. a well-chosen cast delivers a four-star script in fine form. it can be just fun and twisted if that's what you want it to be. it can be more than that. it does have a fresh new look at the horror genre. the makers of this movie do show a potential to become great...although they haven't quite reached that apex yet. not excellent, but a fine, fun, twisted movie that you won't have to be strapped to a table to sit thru.

No...not at all this is a horror film where the roles are reveresed. The ""zombie girl"" in this film is the victim, and the people surrounding her are the true monsters to fear.

 Most of the horror value in this film comes from watching the disturbing decisions being made by the boys that find her. Watching them torture the abandoned patient they find is what will have your gasping. Of course most of it is exagerated. You don't really see them do anything to her so it's pretty tasteful...calling the film raunchy or anything else is only to discredit this horror flick. This movie is more about morality than anything else.

 A bunch of boys find themselves upon a naked girl chained to a bed and to top if off she has supermodel looks. They know no one is going to come looking for her...and it's obvious that she won't go anywhere... so what do they do?

Well.... that's what the movie is about. A group of boys who got the short end of the stick in life. They don't come from anything and have nothing going for them so they don't expect to go anywhere. They are the lower class and they have realized already that they won't be getting the cheerleaders or the girls they fantasize about... but there right infront of them is a beauty that is obtainable.

3918612,4,B002EOVXB0,"A dark and twisted zombie tale involving two high school friends who discover a living ""dead girl"" in the boiler room of an abandoned mental hospital.  Instead of notifying the authorities of their discovery, J.T. (played by Noah Segan) decides that they should keep it a secret between the two and use the girl as a personal sex slave.  The other teen, Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez) having some sense of moral values and common sense, is completely against the idea and wars with himself as to whether or not he should intervene in his friend's repulsive plan.

People often say that there's nothing that hasn't already been done in the zombie sub-genre, but then something like this comes along and makes you completely rethink that statement. `Deadgirl' isn't  so much a conventional horror film as it is a character study on moral indecency.  Yes there are zombies and death, but in `Deadgirl' the human race are portrayed as the actual ""monsters"" with teenage hormones trampling ethical human behavior.

I must say that despite the vulgarity of it all, I love all of the characters in this film and their relationships with one another...superb writing skills on the part of Trent Haaga...and even though the subject matter might sound rather disturbing, Trent manages to throw in some hilarious comic relief to lighten the mood.  What happens when your zombie sex slave is starting to look a little too decrepit?  Do what J.T. does and tape a picture of a hot chick over her face!

`Deadgirl', is probably the most original zombie film I've ever seen and despite its low budget, the film succeeds in every way.  The film really has no weakness whether you're talking about the writing, directing, acting, makeup effects, music, jump scares, suspense, etc..  This is the kind of film George A. Romero should be making rather than the same old stuff he's been doing for the last 30 years.

This is the kind of Horror story that can only be dreamt, or at least it plays out like a sad dream.  It almost seems as if a story like this couldn't be made up haha.  As though it really happened.  I know, that sounds crazy.  'DEADGIRL' never has a slow pace and always kept me glued to the TV wondering what happens next.  Call me slow but I didn't figure out the whole story until the very end.

3918617,2,B002EOVXB0,"A group of male teens stumble across a near dead & bound female in an abandoned Hospital. With little care as to who may have left her for dead and why, they decide to keep her as their sex slave. Variations of this theme dot the cinematic landscape, with perhaps THE COLLECTOR, being the most noteworthy in the legitimate film category. DEAD GIRL, however, is apparently a Zombie film, though such was not played out well. On the plus side this is a slick, (though sick), well produced film, that is NOT a comedy. Just because teens are featured, (who behave like teens), does not make the picture funny. Read some of my other reviews where I discuss this viewer disconnect from reality. Geesh. Anyhow, Caution Spoilers ahead: As usual in much of contemporary cinema; DEAD GIRL portrays men as misogynist beasts, regardless of whether they are high school stoners, dweebs or jocks who are willing to engage in oral sex with a rage infested...woman...zombie...failed lab experiment... Take your pick. This scene and the events which led up to it were not credible, nor was the hand wringing dweeb who repeatedly failed to do what was right and call the police. Apparently he was afraid of JT, the film's main sicko though he had the stones to basically tell his alcoholic dad to ""F-O"". After slicing off the stoner dude's hand, (he was armed with a machete that would do ""Jason"" justice), he drops the weapon and runs from JT. Go figure. Even less credible was the buxom babe who gets nailed in the head by a tire iron at warp speed, though proceeds to lay a savage beating on the 2 wacko male protagonists. Again, this was not a credible scene, especially after the film maker demonstrated that she had a fractured skull after being hit. In reality, she would have instantly been killed by such a blow. Further, that the sex slave had boundless energy when needed, though if she was a Zombie, that is OK. That said, DEAD GIRL could not decide whether it was a Horror film or a drama. The Zombie girl angle should have been better developed. As it stands, DEAD GIRL teases as it only flirts with the Zombie (which is actually a sub plot in the film). I kept waiting for the film to ""jump"", but alas, such was not to be. There was also a lot of talk and I found myself watching the clock. Major questions also remained unanswered such as; ""Where did it come from""? Don't think she laid there for perhaps decades as the Hospital had been abandoned for some time. Also, no one seemed to care about missing girls and dying guys. Where were the authorities? Also some scenes were a little confusing as I believe they were actually dream sequences. The ending also made little sense. Short of giving it away, let me just say that once a dweeb, always a dweeb, (and I don't think that he would have done what he did). DEAD GIRL could have been so much better, but as it stands this is another marginal or even a fair outing with an interesting sub plot (that was poorly developed). That said, this is a sick and offensive film which sends a number of bad messages out to young people, like rape is OK, (albeit with a Zombie?).

3918619,4,B002EOVXB0,"Deadgirl (Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel, 2008)

For some odd reason, though I picked movies I wanted to watch at random over the past week, I started out with mediocre horror flicks, then went upwards in quality in a linear progression. While for obvious reason that makes me a very happy camper, it does make me limit my use of superlatives in reviews for movies that came in the middle of the streak. (Which probably makes you a very happy camper.) I was all set to go gaga over Carver for being the most blood-soaked fun I'd had in weeks. Then I saw Deadgirl, and it was even better. Then I saw Isolation, which is even better, though a thoroughly different kind of horror flick than the two that preceded it, so maybe I should just go back to superlatives and lavish the praise this movie so richly deserves upon it. Now, let me say that the part of me that was thrilled with Deadgirl is also the part that relentlessly devours Matthew Stokoe novels; this is a movie that sets out to do what horror movies have traditionally done (and stopped trying to do about the time they met with mass commercial success), push as many envelopes as possible. Shock and disgust viewers. Make them question, well, everything. And in that vein, Deadgirl is probably the most successful horror film since The Exorcist, though where Friedkin was honed in on religion, Sarmiento and Harel are looking more generically towards societal mores.

Plot: a couple of high school stoners, Rickie (Cadillac Records' Shiloh Fernandez) and TJ (The Brothers Bloom's Noah Segan), cut school one day and, instead of smoking up in the parking lot, decide to utilize a nearby abandoned asylum. This leads to some rampant destruction of property, and then to some exploring. Much to their surprise, the two of them discover what seems to be a forgotten patient in a locked room in the basement. The thing is, the patient, who TJ quickly christens Deadgirl (Jenny Spain in her film debut), should have been dead long ago. TJ experiments, and finds out that she is, in fact, incapable of dying, much to Rickie's horror. Cue the Lord of the Flies vibe here, as the former best friends square off. TJ realizes that what he's got is, essentially, a living (well, undead) blow-up doll, while Rickie, who can't get past the fact that Deadgirl is, or once was, human, wants nothing more than to restore what little dignity she has left to her. When their secret gets out, things just get worse...

Necrophilia, while a semi-popular theme in the music biz ever since Alice Cooper's ""I Love the Dead"", has never really taken hold in the film world outside a very, very small fringe of hardcore freaks (viz. Cerda's Aftermath or Buttgereit's NekRomantik films). When it's part of a film in prudish North America, it's always alluded to, or stylized, or only allowed to happen in clean, sterile conditions with beautiful, undecomposed corpses. (Not, mind you, that this makes me love Kissed any less than I do.) Well, folks, throw that notion away, because Deadgirl comes complete with all the dirt, stench, and decay you could possibly want, and then some. From the prurient-interest standpoint, this has it all, and then some. But (and I'm sure this will surprise some of my regular readers) that's not what impressed me here. (Okay, not all of it.) The real joy of Deadgirl comes from the quartet of lead actors--Fernandez, Segan, Juno's Candice Accola as Rickie's childhood crush, and Paradise Hills' Eric Podnar as TJ and Rickie's third stoner buddy. All four turn in performances way, way above average for a microbudget movie like this. (And Spain's wordless performance is about as powerful as it can be, given that she spends the entire movie unclothed, and most of it restrained.) I have said many, many times that much of the reason scary movies are scary is that we can get inside the heads of the characters and empathize with one or more of them, and never has that been more true than it is here. I'm not sure ""scary"" is the proper term for Deadgirl, though. Aside from the zombie-girl angle, there's not much in the way of horror elements in this film. It's high school angst drama done exceptionally well a la River's Edge (a movie it echoes more than once, which I'm sure isn't a coincidence).

Not to say the movie doesn't have its faults. There are a couple of back-to-back scenes about two-thirds of the way through the film where the movie's humor (which has to this point been black, black, black) is played straight, and they ring false. Some of the acting done by minor characters in the film is downright awful. It's not a perfect film by any means. (But the ending, which some are saying is the movie's biggest flaw, I see as a strength, if for no other reason than because it's getting people arguing about the movie in a way an unambiguous, less offensive ending wouldn't have. And I'm on the side of saying ""yes, I do see how it fits,"" though I can't say more than that without major spoilers.) It is, however, a very strong one. I keep thinking about nudging the rating up half a star and not doing so because of the silly comedy scenes, but it still may happen in the future. This is a good one indeed. *** ",1259539200,4,5199,4.646739130434782

Dead Girl made me a little uneasy and I liked that. The thought of having intimate relations with a captive zombie woman is revolting and twisted and to see it enacted by a group of perverse and morally bankrupt teens was disturbing. Dead Girl features solid acting, and a creepy atmospheric tension as well as a twisted haunting ending that makes this a must own for any horror fan or fan of the macabre.",1257552000,2,540,4.356435643564357

This movie is part horror/zombie,part comedy and part coming of age and it works well on all of those. It also makes you question the line between right and wrong,whats sick and whats not and what a person does when pushed to far and rejected by someone they love(watch the end to see what i mean).I have to say this is one of the best horror movies ive seen in awhile,well worth the money to purchase and time to watch.

3918624,4,B002EOVXB0,"This is a good movie.  It deals with some very interesting and tragic aspects of youth, aspects that become even clearer upon watching the somewhat sparse assortment of extra features.  The director and writer have some interesting input when it comes to the themes presented and examined.  Now, I know some people have been shocked at the graphic portrayals of sex, rape, and violence.  I must confess I found said content to be of less severity than I had been lead to believe.  That being said, this not a film for the squeamish or overly sensitive and caution should definitely be taken when presented to those unconditioned to more hardcore horror material.  I am curious as to the difference between the R rated and unrated versions of the movie, as both edits seem to have the same run time, though.  The other thing I read about the film was that it was too talky and that we weren't treated to enough of the good stuff between extensive scenes of dialogue and narrative development.  I can see that.  That, however, is far from my opinion.  I found the dialogue to be essential to understanding the state and presence of mind with which the characters made their moral choices and decisions to act upon them.  And yes, I realize the supposed sixteen-year-olds appeared to be well into their twenties, but this is far from unusual in the film making process, let alone television programs.  Having looked forward to this release for several months, I guess I could say I was both surprised and disappointed.  On one hand, disappointed for not being as shocked and appalled as I had anticipated/hoped.  But I was far more impressed with the intelligence behind the themes and narrative than I was disappointed for lack of overly graphic gore.  It is a very interesting take on the zombie film, which even to avid zombiphiles like myself, is growing more and more stale.  Good Stuff.",1256342400,2,1889,4.748466257668712
3918625,2,B002EOVXB0,"But it's not as professional, either.

The main (male) character, especially, seems poorly done. The dialog makes sense (sort of) for 14 or 15-year old geeks, but these guys seem a little too cool for that, and they should be past at least a little of the testosterone poisoning guys suffer from at that age. Maybe it's just that the actors had to be adults, and they were not up to pretending to be high-schoolers. (That happens quite often, of course.)

The movie plumbs the utter depths of male misogyny. If you didn't hate the girl who fascinated you in high school and wouldn't give you the time of day (much less ""give it up""), the story, especially the ending, will leave you entirely mystified and repelled.

To really LIKE the movie, you'd have to hate that girl a LOT, and maybe you shouldn't be free to walk the streets.",1256256000,7,831,4.526666666666666
3918626,3,B002EOVXB0,"I read several different reviews of this movie before I decided to buy it.  I read several people describing it as ""different"", ""unique"" and ""brilliant"".  I guess that's one way of looking at it...another would be ""strange, yet boring"".  Deadgirl has it moments where it's entertaining but for the most part I found myself waiting for the movie to hit it's stride.  I found the story to be unbelievable...granted, it's basically a zombie movie, it's still rediculous, even by zombie movie standards.  During the movie I found myself wondering if the director was aiming for horror or comedy because there is plenty of both throughout the entire thing.  Bottom line here is that this movie is definately not an earth-shattering, genius movie.  I wish I would have rented it before I bought it because I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I watched it beforehand.  If anything this is a movie you can bust out just to show your friends that you have it because they probably have never heard of it before.  I don't really see myself ever watching it again unless it's just to show someone else and even then I'll probably be too bored to go through the whole thing again.  It is what it is I guess...if you want a cool-looking, obscure movie to add to your collection then here it is...if you want a film masterpiece then head somewhere else.  That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.",1256256000,3,1388,4.670781893004115
3918627,4,B002EOVXB0,"Yes, I only knew what the horror circles had spouted about this film, mostly positive praise.  I really didn't know much about the plot.  The cover makes it seem as if you're going to go into another tired Japanese-inspired ghost story---YAAAAAWWWWN.  But in fact this is a zombie film.  Wait, that is really,really, REALLY PLAYED OUT at this time too---DOUBLE YAAAAWWWNNN.  Ah, but then there's the actual film Deadgirl.  Yes, it's a zombie film.  No, it has nothing to do with Japanese ghost stories and it's nothing like what Romero has ever attempted(though, in all fairness he has hinted at it in at least two of his immortal zombie films).  This is about teenage boys' sexual ids.  This is about something that teenage outcasts think about all the time as they struggle to get dates or have their first sexual experience.  Sex slaves.  This movie takes that teen fantasy and presents it literally and with horrible consequences.

This film has teenaged characters doing major, awful, graphic acts of misogny--CONSTANTLY.  Even our main character, our defacto hero if you will, is not someone you particularly love.  He's the least slimy of the the male characters, but he's the most 'normal'.  He can at least acknowledge what is going on is wrong, even if he still doesn't end up doing the right thing.  But the writers and directors of this film don't just settle for that.  They illustrate in some detail where this kid comes from and why he makes the bad decisions he makes.  This is a film about the type of outcasts that the Columbine murderers were.  Outcasts even to themselves in the long run.

Like I said, this is a zombie film.  But there's ony one zombie film, and even though I'm sort of spoiling it here, you don't really know it's a zombie film until the end of the second act.  You are really not sure what the hell is going on most the time and why.  I LOVE THAT!  I miss it so much in modern cinema.  Everything is so spelled out and telegraphed, it's nice to a see a film confident enough to just tell the story through the characters' eyes and not have some innocuous character show up to play Johnny The Explainer.  It's all organic and the performances let you inside the characters' heads enough to buy the situation.  Very good.

Though, there is one plot contrivance involving a jock getting his come-upance, that was a bit sketchy for me.  It's a little forced, while being quite unexpected, but I didn't totally buy it.  And after the situation's details unfurl you feel that it was only there for plot details more then any organic reason.  But that's about it.  The acting is all top notch.  Yes, you'll read here on Amazon about how the acting isn't very good, but I've read reviews here where someone actually congratualated the acting in a Friday the 13th film.  Seriously.  Anyway, I've noticed that on Amazon when a viewer doesn't like someone's public image, they tout them a bad actor.  Also, if the actor isn't well known then they're a bad actor.  This is a no-frills horror film.  No names of any kind.  Really good cineamatography.  A really original and originally sick premise.  It will truly get to you in the end and that's something that I haven't been able to say about a horror film in a long while.

I must warn women viewers, this film may disturb and upset you more then the men.  My girlfriend was shocked and appauled.  She had never been so emotionally punched by acts of male characters on film.  I told here to check out In The Company of Men(a brilliant film by playwrite Neil Lebute that corners the market on how horrible misogny can be).  The filmmakers are unflinching in how they show and have their male characters act in this film.  They don't sugar coat it.  Our main antagonist is not perfect.  He's real.  He makes bad decisions, but you understand why they were made.  He's not a hero.  He's a real person.  Finally, real humans showing up in horror again.  It's easy to say what you would or wouldn't do when watching a film and judging, but we all know there's no way you would ever be able to rightly telegraph what you would do in this situation, a totally unlikely and implausable situation that is made real by the filmmakers.  Liking a horrifying film that is actually trying to solicit disgust and horror from you, doesn't make you as bad as the characters.  Relax, people, and just keep telling yourself,
""It's only a movie.""
""It's only a movie.""
""It's only a movie.""
""It's only a movie......""

No Character Development at all. The plot was contrived. The dialog was irrelevant, and the acting was poor. Its as if they took acting lessons from Charlize Theron (ie Stare at the camera and emote). The story doesn't move, nor would I call it a horror film because there was nothing scary about it. It was terribly awkward if anything. Add to this that no one even debates the morality/ethics of having sex with a dead girl they found tied up in an abandoned basement, or that any adults seem at all concerned with the fact that several teenagers are missing/dying.

People who liked this film, also liked - Gouging their eyes with blunt implements, Sticking sharp things in their ears, and Having Sex with Dead People.

Save yourself the time, because god knows I want the 110 minutes of my life I wasted watching this horrid movie back. In fact, I feel as though the producers of the movie should compensate me by paying for my netflix account for having watched it.

3918630,4,B002EOVXB0,"Ok first off, to all the people calling this movie terrible and claiming that it's not horror, you are wrong.

true horror is human nature. This isn't no cookie cutter hollywood rehash or eli roths latest stint in gore porn,

3918631,5,B002EOVXB0,"As with ""River's Edge"" 23 years ago, youth's normal curiosity about death and sex is unhinged and rendered unspeakably perverse by a culture which is organized less by fixed principles than by unconscious, desire-based consumption. These observations employ a darker and more relevant conviction here.

The ideas at work in ""Deadgirl"" are so complex that calling this a ""horror film"" is perhaps not really accurate given the limitations by which the genre is judged. Admittedly, the film employs standard horror grammar, but by keeping an eye firmly fixed on economy and purpose, the directors avoid the pitfalls and cleverly make those limits work in their favor.

For example, the girl in question, while an ""object"" in strictly horror terms, is carefully crafted to be something other than a person - she functions as a perfect cipher onto which alternative meanings can be projected. Unlike typical ""horror girls,"" she becomes as profoundly disturbing a concept as anything that contemporary horror has given us. She seems less an external creature than something within the characters. A fever dream of sexual, pathological-narcissism or trauma-porn-attachment made flesh. The context in which the story functions, an abandoned asylum is also rendered abstractly enough that one might read it equally as a metaphor or a place in the real world; an image of the rotting mind where deviance lurks - normally it's just a spooky ol' building when used in horror

The characters enter such a bottomless pit in terms of real human behavior that whether intentional or not, a sense of allegory provides grounding for the audience, while grounding is desperately missing in the world these characters occupy.

The film's male protagonists are are certainly of their time and they seem quite real to me. As with many kids today their sensitivities seem bleached away by what we all witness, a relentless, post-narrative media blast from earliest childhood and education without adequate social breadth. Their personal, familial inadequacies here seem to create a hunger for an effortless, narcissistic attachment. These are familiar kids. Placing them into this particular tale and intelligently imagining an outcome is what the directors have done. It is startling how effective it is.

While ""Deadgirl""could easily have come across as a simply ghastly spectacle, the film transcends genre, as well as outflanking the need to simply entertain, shock or titillate. By its solid execution, its restraint and through the indigestible, dark brilliance of its idea, the film rises to the level of art.",1254268800,10,2593,5.283980582524272
3918632,5,B002EOVXB0,"After seeing all of the terrible reviews for this film, I'm feeling compelled to defend it a little.  There's not much to explain with the plot:  Two teenage boys find a zombie chained up in the boiler room of an abandoned mental facility and decide to ""keep it"".  Ricky, who is thinking rationally and wishes to report the find; and JT, who is thinking with his hormones and sees an opportunity that he can't pass up.  The two boys represent the two extremes found within any healthy teenage boy's psyche.  One extreme tells us to think of the moral impact and consequences of our raging pubescent sexuality.  The other extreme, that which is given by Mother Nature, urges boys of this age to have sex with just about anything that has the proper equipment.

And that's what this movie is really about.  It's a reflection on our own primal urges to mate and to covet.  It's a sadistically honest look at what it's like growing into manhood trying to fit into an unforgiving social structure while every cell in your body is screaming, ""SEX!""

It may seem unrealistic that two normal boys would resort to such defilement; but I guarantee you, every Friday night there is a party somewhere with teenage boys thinking one thing:  ""Let's get that girl drunk and have 'fun' with her.""

So are you supposed to care about these boys? Not really.  But hopefully you'll watch this and understand what it was like as a teenager to feel unrequited love, and the overwhelming desire to feel in control of your life and those who have rejected you.

Probably the most original zombie movie I've ever seen.
