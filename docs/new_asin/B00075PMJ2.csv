8505868,5,B00075PMJ2,"Excellent show! A friend of mine saw the show live at Bolivia, in Bocca's farewell tour. I watched the DVD with her and she came into tears with the opportunity to review the show. The lights are too bright probably because of the filming needs, so it looses a bit of the show's actual intimate atmosphere. We also cannot see the onstage orchestra, which is always something worthy to watch. Music is a must, and includes pieces of Astor Piazzolla and Carlos Gardel.",1197849600,,466,4.626506024096385
