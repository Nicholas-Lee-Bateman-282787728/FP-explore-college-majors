7983407,2,B00008G91H,"I enjoy really good comical hentai such as Girl Next Door, Like A Mom or Anyone You Can Do I can Do Better. But Rei Rei Missionary of Love is at best barely hentai. Sure there are a few barely minor erotic scenes in the storyline. But not what I would call hentai, more on the order of strong ecchi. The character design is poor at best and the story it's self wouldn't hold your attention. Granted I'm not a big fan of hentai anime buit the few titles I do have are far better than this. To be honest, the main stream anime title Grenadier offered more erotica than Rei Rei.

I purchased this anime from RightStuf along with other items (probably cheaper than from Amazon)
Do yourself a favour and don't waste your money on this dvd.",1362182400,,734,4.280575539568345
7983408,5,B00008G91H,"This is an ideal movie, if your really into seeing some really graphic sex. I happened to have ejoyed this from the first episode. It has some drug use in the first one, but it gets better after that. I won't lie to you, because you will feel a bit strange in a good way after you've seen the last episode. That one's the best of the best. Too good to throw away.",1170979200,,363,3.9863013698630136

7983410,1,B00008G91H,"Just as bad as Stepmother Sin, Rei Rei's animation leaves a lot to be desired. In the dubbed version I was tortured with, the voice acting is terrible, absolutely terrible.

Rei Rei is a series of short ""love stories"" about boys and girls that a ""love goddess"" (Kaguya) and her nasty, icky little peverted sidekick help with the use of her magical powers.

One story is about a boy who turns into a girl (GAH! SUCKAGE VOICE ACTING!) and blah blah, blah; another is about a boy who is so afraid of girls he can't get it on with his horney girlfriend (aww, poor baby.) A third takes the viewers inside a video game where Kaguya has to be rescued by a male side-character she is trying to help. (YAY for mild tentacles in this scene.)

Filled with whiney, obnoxious male characters, the only redeeming point is that Kaguya is very, very hot. However, the ""here, drink my milk to become a strong, virile MAN"" scene near the end of the dvd is a real turn-off. Darn it, sexy women scenes should not be spoiled by pathetic little boys who need help getting it up.

All in all, the version I viewed made me want to bang my head against the wall in an attempt to drive out the hideous voice-acting inabilities starred in this abused anime.

For a slightly better choice in viewing, I'd suggest Magical Twilight as an alternative to Rei Rei. Boy-Girl sex with cute girls, these two are comparable.

But, god, the voice acting. *gackt*",1110067200,2,1424,4.478764478764479
