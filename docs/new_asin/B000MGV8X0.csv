8169182,5,B000MGV8X0,"Larry the cable guy wrote on his website asking people not to buy this DVD, he just does not want anybody to buy it because he is not getting any money from it. Larry the cable guy is a millionaire which the reporter talks about when he interviews his manager on the 60 minutes DVD. Larry the cable guy is just being selfish. He used to be funny before he got married and had kids, it's great that he has a family but he talks more about his family on his website then about his regular jokes he does on stage. He had a Christmas special on TV and the best person there was Thelma from Mama's family! I say, buy the DVD!",1196985600,,620,4.048780487804878
8169183,1,B000MGV8X0,"Warning to all shoppers thinking about purchasing this DVD: This is not an officially authorized product from Larry The Cable Guy or his management.

This is not new comedy material, Blue Collar video, or anything else that Larry The Cable Guy has authorized for sale or distribution. Do not buy it.",1195084800,,441,4.666666666666667
8169184,1,B000MGV8X0,You pay a lot for a 12 minute interview on 60 minutes.  They didn't have that in the description. I thought it was a new DVD standup.  Stay away.. As a matter of fact I will sell you mine real cheap.,1178409600,3,199,3.8292682926829267
8169185,3,B000MGV8X0,From reading the intro I did not expect a short 10-15 minute DVD with little or no stand up from Larry.,1177200000,3,103,3.9523809523809526
