2299555,5,B0009LQXNS,Do you miss being in Hawaii? Watching this video and hearing the the music from Na Leo will transport you back to your island paradise. I Miss You My Hawai'i!,1129161600,7,158,4.3
2299556,5,B0009LQXNS,"Everyone TALKS about 'Life Balance'.  They usually mean something like, ""Turn off your Blackberry while you are making love with your spouse.""  Or, ""Get crazy, go home after 14 hours at work and watch 'Survivor' until you fall asleep slouched on your couch.""

What has been missing, in my experience, is any strategy that fits into a 'post modern life' in a believable way.

This DVD is an example of a believable mechanism to experience a bit of 'Life Balance' in the midst of a real life.  Rx:  Put on your 'Bose' noise cancelling headphones, pop this DVD into your computer wherever you happen to be with a FEW MOMENTS TO SPARE.  Viola!  Breath in, breath out, watch the screen, and when you HAVE TO GO, then go.

Notice that wherever you HAVE TO go, you are going with a bit more of that part of yourself that usually dissolves in rush and distractions.

The quality of this video is first rate, the mix of visual and auditory material is terriffic.

Buy it now, if you don't love it on first viewing, GIVE IT TO A FRIEND who appreciates the finer things and go back to your Excel Spreadsheet (tm).",1116028800,13,1102,4.46

8062997,5,B0009LQXNS,"The best way to describe this DVD is that it is like a ""Best of"" Na Leo CD accompanied by video of Hawaiian scenes - beautiful sunsets and waterfalls, surfing and sugar cane fields, local small towns and even some vintage Waikiki.  So, if you love Na Leo, you cannot go wrong with this DVD.

If you don't know Na Leo, they are a female group who perform mostly original contemporary Hawaiian music in soft blending three-part harmony.  This is far from a travel video, but if you have lived in or traveled extensively in Hawaii, you will enjoy recognizing familiar landmarks.

This DVD is a lovely background for a home luau, or any relaxing evening or weekend.  It is the next best thing to a return flight to paradise.",1324944000,,720,4.507692307692308
8062998,5,B0009LQXNS,"This DVD is rarer than hen's teeth, but if you can find one, I highly recommend it. Very, very beautiful secenery accompanied by the angelic sounds of La Neo. A winning combination! I also enjoyed the special features with the interviews of the band, and the bonus video of Local Boys! Na Leo totally needs to restock this one, and maybe even expand it to include that beautiful song of theirs ""Where I live, there are rainbows.""",1323734400,,429,4.584415584415584
8062999,5,B0009LQXNS,"Whenever I feel down and need a boost or simply want to remember my holidays in Hawaii I load this into my DVD player. I thouroughly recommend this DVD. The music is soothing, relaxing and the visuals are breathtaking. Grab a cold beer or a maitaii, sit back and enjoy. Pity this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. As for the reviewer who gave one star, did he know he was not buying a travel video?????.Millie",1263340800,2,418,4.5131578947368425
8063000,5,B0009LQXNS,If you've ever visited Hawaii and you want to go back to your favorite places...THIS is the way to go!  I love putting this on and relaxing just like when I'm in the warm Hawaiian sun.,1137110400,9,184,4.111111111111111
8063001,1,B0009LQXNS,"I was very disappointed with Na Leo.  It seemed like a travel promotion that should have been a few minutes but lasted an hour. The shots were very repetitive, lots of sunsets, and the photography was only average.  No narration and you only knew what island they were on if you had been there before.  The music was only average, being modern and not traditional Hawaiian.",1133308800,10,373,4.621212121212121
