1254094,2,B00002IJ48,"I had purchased this over 10 years ago, excited to have a comprehensive video collection of Alice In Chains on DVD....

...until I started to play it. Well the videos are in excellent quality, but what's up with the AUDIO???

Then I carefully read the entire DVD package, only to discover something I overlooked -- ""remixed by Toby Wright."" That's right, they let this nimrod remix them to ""his style""!! FORGET WHAT YOU REMEMBER FROM MTV AND YOUR CDs!

It amazes me how many people highly rate this video collection when the MUSIC matters in MUSIC VIDEOS! AVOID THIS DVD!",1451779200,,571,4.69

1254097,4,B00002IJ48,"I'm not a huge fan of the band- I like them enough- but I do enjoy music DVDs, especially when you get a lot of footage of the band behind-the-scenes.  It's an endlessly interesting lifestyle and I enjoy seeing the human beings behind the talent.  Of course, in this case, the primary figure is Layne Staley, who battled depression and drug addiction until his ultimate demise.  Music Bank includes a comprehensive collection of the band's music videos along with bonus demos and extra band footage.  The Unplugged songs are eerie in the same way as Kurt Cobain's session there was as you're watching a spectacle that you already know ends badly in the performers' near future.  Well worth the price as the band's musical output was as iconic as anyone's was in the age of grunge and sludge rock.",1445299200,,796,4.697841726618705

1254116,5,B00002IJ48,"This is a great collection of all AIC videos we once  watched on MTV in the 90's. Your money will be well spent .Althought ,i have to say some of the videos (We die young, Would? and Heaven's beside you) kind have some wack audio .Don't know what they did when they remastered them ,but they messed up the audio. Specially WOULD? Man! that video it is just plain awesome and some dude did something with the audio. If you are a true fan ,you'll notice. But even so, I take it. Don't care.
The home videos and backstage stuff also great. You get to see the guys relax and having fun...must of them are from the early days of AIC.
One thing you can not miss to notice is Layne's  physical deterioration . It is just painful to see the progression of his addiction .Althought his voice never changed and always sounded as great as he was. You can not help missing Layne even more . It's 2015 and still love grunge and still love Alice in Chains. Now, let's put the Nona Tapes available on dvd at least!.",1423785600,,1000,4.257894736842105

1254118,5,B00002IJ48,"I can't emphasize how good it is to have ALL of these great, memorable Music Videos in one DVD.  Beyond that, the sound quality of this DVD is AMAZING!!!!! Put it on Dolby Digital 5.1 and ENJOY this amazingly mastered DVD of music video ART.

Layne was a unique and unexpectedly talented individual.  And obviously an icon of the 90s. If you're reading this, you probably also understand that Alice In Chains is the most underrated band of the era as well. Jerry Cantrell's songwriting and guitar riffs are some of the best ever heard and I think that musicians will be re-discovering and re-appreciating these songs for years to come.",1421884800,,635,4.702702702702703

1254143,4,B00002IJ48,"A testimony, if you will, to the best band of the 1990's. For some reason  they were lumped in with the ""grunge movement"" which really wasn't a movement at all.... it was a backlash to all the lame-ass fake poodle hair bands of the 80's by musicians that appeared not to shower regularly.",1380844800,,288,4.433962264150943

1254149,5,B00002IJ48,"I love this DVD, it's nice having having all of the videos (well the old videos anyway) all together. I'm a younger fan, I was 5 when the last full album featuring Layne Staley was released so this is really cool for fans who were too young to really appreciate this material in the 1990s. DVDs like this and MTV Unplugged are the only ways people my age will ever be able to see Layne. Alice In Chains was an amazing band and this DVD shows that. I'm sure the newer stuff is great but I haven't gotten around to it yet.",1357689600,,520,4.107843137254902
1254150,2,B00002IJ48,The DVD was shipped and arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape.  However the DVD content was too much of a documentary style (with some language) whereas I'd hoped for just music videos.  I'll just regift it to a die-hard Alice in Chains fans and I'm sure they'll be excited.,1357689600,,282,4.403846153846154
1254151,5,B00002IJ48,Great DVD I am enjoying it very much. Also has some behind the seen footage.  great buy for the money!,1355702400,,102,4.1
1254152,5,B00002IJ48,"I cannot be considered a hardcore Alice in Chains fan, but I have always appreciated their music and was very sad when Layne Staley died in 2002 and then Mike Starr last year (2011).  I don't care how many incarnations there are of Alice in Chains, it's not the same without them.

With that said, I picked this up because I loved their music and it brings me back to better times, but what pleasantly surprised me was that I liked every minute of this video (yes, even the shots of the atrocious kitchen sink).  Their dedication to their music was obvious, the devotion of their core fans crystal clear, and that passion came through in every video.

I was used to hearing many of these songs on the radio as a teen, but watching these videos all these years later was a pleasant experience.  It's always interesting listening to music with older ears because you have a tendency to regret not appreciating it more at the time it came out.  That's what happened to me with ""Video Bank.""

Unfortunately, I fell into that category of labeling Alice in Chains as just another grunge/alternative band from Seattle, but that was a huge mistake.  In reality, they put out some damned good music (along with the rest of the Seattle supergroups) that fails to sound dated over 20 years later.

This is one of the best video compilations I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few).  I like the way there are two videos, then concert footage or home video, then one or two more videos, etc.  The whole thing was very well put together and I'd recommend it to anyone who's either a hardcore Alice in Chains buff or someone just discovering their music.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1354406400,,1662,4.521739130434782
1254173,5,B00002IJ48,"Always enjoyed listening to Alice in Chains. Facelift, Dirt, Jar of Flies. Dirt is one of my favorite metal albums.

I believe this dvd contains all of their videos up until Layne Staley's passing. Personally I like Man in the Box, Again, No Excuses, & The Rooster.. ""Again"" is one of my favorite songs from the band.. whenever I listen to it, the volume goes up to 11. All the videos are there with the obvious exception of their latest releases.. Straight-forward, video compilation is what your getting.. Well worth the money.

I've had the dvd for over a year. Cannot remember what I paid, (10 bucks maybe), but well worth it. I know I could just watch them on You Tube but the quality is sooo much better on disc.

Sidenote: Enjoyed several songs (and videos) from their last album: ""Black Gives Way to Blue (2009)"".. Lesson Learned, Your Decision, Check My Brain to name a few. Hope the band keeps writing and releasing music and videos. They still sound great!",1345161600,,967,4.6104651162790695
1254174,5,B00002IJ48,"Man, ALICE IN CHAINS is one of the greatest heavy rock bands of ALL TIME!!! Their sound is unique and their videos are INCREDIBLY COOL!!!!!YES, they 're ALL really COOL!!!! THEM BONES is the BEST video i have seen in my life...Layne and the band look so dark and metal, and the animals fighting....Stay Away is another magic video...FANTASTIC!!! WOW!!! And the raw metal  of WE DIE YOUNG and the brutal hit MAN IN THE BOX???All the videos here rocks...if you like Alice or want to see what this AMAZING band is about, yoy will like these great images!!!RIP LAYNE!!!",1339459200,,565,4.65

1254179,4,B00002IJ48,"When I bought this DVD, I just wanted to watch Alice's clips.
The DVD delivers much more, as each song is remixed in 5.1. Even though the mix is not top notch, it does add some depth to the songs and the whole experience is very interesting.
It also features some behind the scenes footage, but I got nothing to say about it.
I deducted one star as the DVD menu is kinda stubborn and never does what you want.",1284681600,,409,4.125
1254180,5,B00002IJ48,"If you're an Alice in Chains fan, please do youself a favor and buy this DVD.  Not only are all their most popular hits included but the DVD has actual footage of the band members themselves.  It is a treasure, as there is not much media to commemorate Layne Staley. I wish someone would do a life story or Biography.",1284163200,,317,4.266666666666667
1254181,5,B00002IJ48,"This is a great dvd to own. If your a fan of Alice in Chains this dvd is for you. It features all there music videos and the home video footage is a nice little extra. If you've only heard of this band and have never really listened to there music I recommend this dvd, GRUNGE 4 EVER!!!",1249344000,,286,3.9482758620689653
1254182,5,B00002IJ48,"Wow where do i start? I'm a huge alice in chains fan, and was very excited to get this dvd, it has clips of the guys from there beginnings living in a dirty apartment, And there first video for ""We Die Young"" to the last video ""Get Born Again"" it includes the uncut video for ""Rooster"". These are almost priceless to me being such a huge AIC fan, They carry on today without Layne, I haven't heard them with the new singer ,I have heard good thing's about them now though! But to me and most all AIC fans, without Layne they are not Truly Alice In Chains! However i am glad Jerry Cantrell has kept the name alive! ok dvd video's on this disk are in order as follows.........
1. We Die Young-2 versions, art institute of seattle version and the MTV video.
2. Man In The Box
3. Sea Of Sorrow

1254193,5,B00002IJ48,This is great for an AIC fan. It has an interview of Layne and the remaining members of AIC in their younger days. It has several music videos. I have never seen most of these videos on MTV or VH1. Worth the money!,1233446400,,214,4.0
1254194,4,B00002IJ48,"This is a good dvd with AICs videos, but I wish there was more behind the scenes and interview material from throughout their existence. These guys were good and played hard without being cheesy or whining like everyone does now.",1231372800,,229,4.75

1254196,5,B00002IJ48,This DVD is simply amazing. The sound quality is just insane. You can really tell the difference between a regular CD and 5.1 Dolby Digital DVD quality. The remastering job they did for this DVD is flawless. You can hear notes you wouldn't be able to hear on a CD. It sounds as if the band were playing right in front of you. This DVD is just perfect.,1191888000,,351,4.176470588235294

In a way it answered so many questions. What an experience? To watch the bands video clips back to back, told the story of the band and ultimately Layne's last years. I can't imagine getting the same perspective sitting there watching music video clips on TV over the years. Here you saw the talent grow continuosly,  coupled with the rise peak and fall of Layne and his relationship with drugs..... It was so compelling I showed my 13 year old - this is what drugs do to you. I loved the DVD, but then again I love Alice in Chains,  but shame about the Audio quality",1176249600,,871,5.397058823529412

1254199,5,B00002IJ48,"Watching this video, I thought two things.  One, what a great and artistic group of musicians Alice in Chains was.  It's the kind of music that when you listen to the lyrics you feel the souls of Staley and Cantrell just pouring out in their music.  It's all the more evident when you see it.  At the same time, it's amazing to trace how Layne Staley disintegrated from his rampant heroine from the early videos to the MTV unplugged show AIC performed.  The irony is that if he was clean, we probably wouldn't have any of this music to remember him by.  Sometimes I guess it's better to burn out than fade away.  A great DVD.",1169769600,,625,4.336206896551724
1254200,4,B00002IJ48,"Awesome collection of videos from one of the greatest bands of all times. I think you won't feel disappointed with the content, as it includes all the videos ever made by the band as well as some additional `on the road' footage shot by the band and crew members.

The only reason, why a hardcore Alice in Chains devotee like myself would not give this one a flawless five-star rating is because for some reason someone did a terrible mess-up with the audio mix making it almost a crime to hear the now hideously disfigured vocals in `We die young', or how the arrangements sound in `I stay away'.

If you can live with that, then I guess this is the ultimate AIC deal ever.",1167177600,,674,4.384
1254201,5,B00002IJ48,"This DVD looks and sounds spectacular...The remastering job they did is short of amazing, my surround sound system gets a work out, it's crystal clear, and alot of nice bass.

Alice in Chains to me are considered Heavy Rock, I noticed people want to put them in the ""Grunge"" catergory, but for me they just were a Heavy Rock/Metal band...and one of my favorites. If you like AIC then you need this DVD in your collection.",1164067200,,421,4.5394736842105265

1254226,5,B00002IJ48,"I know two things about ""grunge"". No one really knows what that is and true Seattle music fans hate that term. It was just another label used by the greedy music corporations who wanted to cash in on an exploding Seattle music scene. My aversion to that label and what I perceived as grunge music back then, led me and a lot of other people to ignore some really great music that came out of that city in the 90s. Alice in Chains was definitely one of the best, as this DVD shows, and there is nothing ""grungy"" about them.",1140739200,,522,4.23

The home videos give some insight into ""regular guys"" with GREAT talent who are a little uncomfortable in front of the lens (except when they are performing).  In other words, you can tell that, with them, it's definitely about the MUSIC.  And they did some of the very best made in the nineties (and looked awesome doing it, from the female perspective).  Highlights include Grind, Again, We Die Young, I Stay Away, and Rooster.  I highly recommend this collection to any AIC fan.",1127952000,,538,4.804347826086956
1254229,5,B00002IJ48,"These guys made music and video the likes of which most musicians only dream of. The beatles were talentless bums next to them. I've never seen talent like this.

Some people here have said that the sound is awful, and (as some other users have pointed) it must be because they heard the 5.1 mix in an stereo equipment, getting the sound only partially. They should have chosen the PCM audio track instead, before writting misleading opinions.

So, wether you are an AIC fan, or a fan of grunge, this is a must have. This DVD visually documents the work of a great group, with the best sound you can get. Some videos could be considered ""ordinary"" but most of them have great quality of images and/or concepts. And they are intertwined by home footage and concert images, so basically, we have a 1 and half hour peek of the work of the band.",1107561600,,820,4.46
1254231,5,B00002IJ48,"Highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommended .... If you are an AiC fan then this is a MUST own...Completely and Totally worth every penny...With the included ""home video"" clips this compilation takes you ""behind the scenes"" so to speak of one of the BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME...you get to see the ""lighter side"" of the band members and it makes you miss Layne even more than you already do if you're a TRUE AiC fan.  AMAZING !!!",1092960000,,416,4.473684210526316
1254232,5,B00002IJ48,"Easy to nav, awesome picture & sound.  The home movies are an addition, not a distraction.  This accurately shows the greatness of AIC.",1086134400,,135,4.826086956521739
1254243,5,B00002IJ48,"Ok ok, I'll admit that if Alice aren't my favourite band in the world, they're in my top 3, and near as I can tell, they cannot do any wrong...Anyway, this the Video Bank which accompanies the Music Bank boxed set. While the Music Bank has 48 tracks - new, old, unreleased and rarities, this carries far fewer. All the videos the band ever made are on the disc; as well as a couple of behind the scenes things which show the band at play between shows and interviews and what-have-you. Here in sunny South Africa, we don't get this sort of thing anymore. We barely got it back then, either; but there are officially zero radio stations which have a majority-rock playlist so for the most part the only good stuff we get is current chart rock. we get even less in terms of music videos, that's for sure, so I was obliged to rush out to buy this item as soon as it became available here a couple years after everywhere else (as usual - welcome to darkest Africa). It was bought sight unseen - the only Alice videos I'd ever seen before getting this were those for Grind and Again; and a clip of I'll stay away from the boxset's 4th disc. So I was in entirely virgin territory even though I have almost all the albums at home. I have to say some of the stuff is a little cheesy - but in a good way. The first two videos are for We Die Young and they both are kinda psychedelic and 80s (in a bad way - sensory overload). But it picks up after that, with some magnificent material there for the taking, including all their big hits and the new track (well, new at the time) Get Born Again, which is creepy and disturbing and reminds me of the video for The Unforgiven by Metallica. As I said, some of the videos are not great and a little boring and overdone - Rooster, for one, whose video I don't like even though the song is classic - but there are some gems in there as well. There is also a mini documentary form an old TV spot put together ny some executive with some foresight waaaaaaay back when Facelift broke in 1989 or thereabouts; as well as a few extras/behind the scenes items which focus on the band as not-Alice and just being old friends messing about backstage. The disc could have benefited from having an interview or two, I thought, perhaps hauling in a director from one of the videos and having a mini MTv-esque ""Making the video"" segment for one or two of the tracks. Unfortunately, you get the impression Columbia Records didn't want to have to pump any more cash into this than absolutely necessary, which is forgiveable in that there was an accompanying CD boxed set; but at the same time, it does come off as sort-of budget. I rate the compilation as five stars; but in terms of content (ie bonus materials on a normal DVD movie) only 2 stars, since It's pretty much just chapter selection and that's it. Still, works well to plug it into your DVD player, leave the TV off and just play it as a greatest hits CD through the stereo speakers!",1084320000,,2963,4.311827956989247
1254244,5,B00002IJ48,"I have been a fan since the early '90s.  I kinda got hooked on them after they had already been around for a few years.  So I missed most of the videos that were released on MTV.  It was a pure treat to be able to see all these videos for the first time.  The only one I had seen previously was ""No Excuses"".  I had the best time cranking the sound system up to the point my 350W sub was going to clip, turn down the lights, and become completely absorbed.  The 5.1 mix was really great, with just a few oddities like a cymbal crash coming from some strange direction.  The sound quality was much better that CD, you can definitly hear the difference.  One note, if you don't have 5.1, make sure you use the 2 channel mix or you will experience the same thing one of the previous reviewers did; missing channels.  The sound is so good on this that I actually program my DVD player to just play the videos (cut the behind scenes) and leave my TV off.  Then I just enjoy the great audio, just like one of those DTS music CDs.  I sometimes prefer the audio only so that I can have the lights off and listen in the dark.  As for the videos, they are all very good and fun to watch.  I especially like the hard to find ones like ""Get Born Again"".  Go out and get this thing! It is almost cheaper than a CD and has better sound.",1071446400,,1322,4.0346153846153845
1254245,1,B00002IJ48,"I have a large collection of music DVDs and laserdics, so I have a pretty good spread of quality in terms of video and audio quality.  First of all, you can't beat the bang for the buck on this one.  Pricing aside, I really liked the way they inserted some documentary footage, especially from the band's earlier days to show some personality.  The videos look clean (even on a large HD projection screen) with good color as well.  I was very pleased with the 5.1 surround mix on my system, which is where many of these DVDs fail.  I recommend this highly if you want both a greatest hits collection with some well produced videos.",1071187200,,631,4.452173913043478
1254246,5,B00002IJ48,"I have been a devoted Chains fan for as long as I can remember.  I acutally did not even know they had put out a DVD of their videos until a friend bought me this for my birthday in July.  All the video's look and sound excellent, especially with a nice home theatre system, or a decent rack system.  The highlights include ""Would,"" ""What the hell have I,"" ""Heaven Beside You,"" and other footage in between.
I must caution though, the sad part about this DVD is that you can see the steady decline of Layne Staley, who passed away in Spring 2002.  From the beginning he looks mostly normal, but by the time you see the videos from the ""tripod"" period and the MTV Unplugged, it appears that Staley is fried completely, given his empty stare and unheatlthy look.  Buy this if you are a fan of Alice in Chains, or if you like decent metal music.",1062547200,,842,4.30379746835443
1254247,3,B00002IJ48,"I am a huge AIC fan, and was thrilled when I saw the VHS copy of this.  I've watched it more times than I can count.  So why the 3 stars?  Something is a little goofy with the sound on the DVD, and I've heard the same complaint from other people.  The harmonies are the most affected, with Jerry completely drowning Layne out on some songs.
All in all, stick with the VHS copy.  It's outstanding.",1058400000,,396,4.157894736842105

Not only the videos but the live scenes and scenes in hotel rooms. It gave me an idea of what they were likeoutside the studio (although I had a slight idea). The videos are still sweet, and if I ever need a reminder of what Layne was like I can pop that sucker in. Need I say more.",1038960000,,437,4.093023255813954

This DVD is it if special features are your interest! It has a discography, home video footage, and every Alice In Chains video! Including We Die Young the seatle version and Rooster in its uncut version! ... They were that good! Almost being to the point of were it is a joke!

1254254,5,B00002IJ48,"Having been a big AIC fan for some time I was looking forward to this compilation and must say that I wasn't disappointed. If you own a decent home cinema setup with a DD5.1 amp and 6 speakers you are in for a real treat. Most of their classic songs are included here and all have been remixed into sexy DD 5.1 (there's also a PCM stereo track). All sound superb though a couple of the remixes aren't as good as they might have been. The majority of the videos are excellent and have stood the test of time very well, although some are now a bit long in the tooth yet still retain a certain novelty value. The addition of about 15 minutes worth of the band's own home movies are excellent and provide a genuine and hilarious insight behind the scenes.
Overall this a very worthy purchase and comes highly recommended - especially if you like your 5.1 music turned up loud. Now if only Foo Fighters and Aerosmith would get their acts together and bring out the same sort of compilation.",1001635200,,985,4.358695652173913

Alice In Chains is one of my favorite bands, and it's sad that they're not together anymore. This DVD takes me back to my grunge days when I was still in High School. It's got 17 videos plus a little documentary and some clips of the band between videos. It also has a complete discography and videography (only missing Greatest Hits, and that's because that one was released last month), so you'll know if you're missing any of their recordings. It's a great DVD, and I recommend it to any fan and any person who likes rock music, 'cause that's what this is, one of the greatest rock bands of all time.

I don't particularly like the song song  ""Away"", but the claymation is really awesome, plus it has some  creepy looking circus freaks doing messed up stuff. The main reason this  video is so good is because it shows how artistic Alice in Chains really  are. They have made some of the most amazing videos I have ever seen. They  boggle the eyes.
