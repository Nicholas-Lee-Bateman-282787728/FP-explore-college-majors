5901124,5,B00EBBGLKM,"I got this DVD for Horrible Bosses, it was ok.  I had never heard of Crazy, Stupid, Love.  That movie is amazing.",1395878400,,113,4.090909090909091
5901125,4,B00EBBGLKM,"Neither of these movies got a whole lot of respect in original release, altho' I don't know why: both of them were very enjoyable. Not a Steve Carell fan when he's trying to be funny: he's much better as a deadpan actor than the bug-eyed over-the-top comedian roles he usually gets. CSL is a subtly comedic love story, not the run of the mill rom-com, for sure. Horrible bosses? What can I say: they're truly horrible, and thoroughly funny!",1395187200,,440,4.582278481012659
5901126,5,B00EBBGLKM,I love the movie Crazy Stupid Love and my hubby loves Horrible Bosses. For the price you could not go wrong. The movies are very different though. One is more of a romantic comedy where the latter is more of a raunchy comedy. The price difference was only $1 for the double disc (vs Crazy Stupid Love only).,1394582400,,307,4.310344827586207
5901127,4,B00EBBGLKM,"I enjoyed both movies.  Purchased it because I like most of the actors in both movies.  I'd call them 'cute' movies.  Some funny parts, some romance.  I liked both of the movies.",1394582400,,178,4.46875

5901134,5,B00EBBGLKM,"I loved both movies, but Horrible Bosses was absolutely hilarious!! It's funny to watch Jennifer Aniston play
