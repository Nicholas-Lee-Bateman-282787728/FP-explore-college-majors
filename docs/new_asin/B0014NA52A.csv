Until I watched this DVD, didn't know what was the motivation behind those words.

The story behind the father-sons relationship is very touching, and effectively humanizes (humorously in some parts, to boot) this film.

3133841,4,B0014NA52A,"DR BRONNER'S MAGIC SOAPBOX is a documentary on the life and thought of Emmanuel Bronner (1908-1997), the German immigrant who made the soap popular with 1960s counter-culture and now alternative people everywhere. Dr. Bronner infamously covered his soap labels with rambling statements in tiny print, preaching the unity of mankind in an ""all-one-god religion"". This is an individual with a fascinating story, well worth a documentary film. He left Germany before the Holocaust (in which his parents perished), worked as a chemist before being hospitalized in Elgin Asylum, and escaped to California to set up the now-famous soap brand. In the 1940s, he had two sons which grew up in foster care, since their father considered his spiritual calling much more important than a couple of children. Jim and Ralph eventually reconciled with their father and inherited the company.

Filmmaker Sara Lamm has assembled video footage of Dr. Bronner and carried out interviews with his employees and acquaintances, as well as everyday Americans who love his soap. She also follows Ralph (the current owner of the company) as he travels the country, telling stories about his father and turning people on to Dr. Bronner's Soap. While other interviews focus on Dr. Bronner's history of mental illness, Ralph speaks of his father as an eccentric and perennial non-comformist.

Ralph has also tried to emulate his father's sense of idealism, albeit not his religious ideals, and some attention is given to his philantrophic endeavours. It is heartwarming that this head of a multi-million dollar business is so ready to help those he encounters, but I feel that there's too much attention on Ralph's kindness to people in the street, and insufficient attention to the structure of the company. Ralph mentions in passing that it's something of a cooperative endeavour, but we don't really get details.

Still, except for that quibble, I enjoyed this film greatly. It certainly puts the bizarre labels on the bottles into perspective, and makes you muse on the thin line between incapacitating madness and an eccentricity that still spurs a man on to great things.",1330128000,,2149,5.187319884726225
3133842,5,B0014NA52A,"I had always wondered about the soap in the store with the somewhat ranting label.  I loved this amazing story.  This documentary has such an uplifting message, that absolutely nothing can stop you from pursing what you
truly believe in.  I also absolutely love the way that the company is run. That the family has capped their salaries to be no more than 5 times what the lowest salary wage is.

3133844,4,B0014NA52A,"If you've ever wondered about the crazy guy that writes all that crazy stuff on the labels of Dr. Bronner's Soap, this movie is worth watching.  Turns out that the real Dr. Bronner is even more wild, hyperventilating, fire-breathing, kooky and eccentric than even the crazy soap labels hint at.

Including Bronner's children and grandchildren was a genius move on the film-maker's part, because the soap company can be understood through their point of view much better than Dr. Bronner.  I think the real reason he sold soap was to have an audience for his soap labels - the Moral ABC was his real product. He certainly doesn't seem to care for profits. The soap company is a non-profit, and from what I can tell, is one of the more socially responsible companies in the country today, with their profits going towards dozens of deserving charities.

Although the film is brief at 88 minutes, I just watched the first 30 minutes then skipped to the end.  The film tends to keep repeating itself.  Still, very informative, and I'm glad I watched (the first 30 minutes). The movie inspired me enough to want to go out and buy a big bottle of the peppermint soap today.",1286323200,,1167,4.668292682926829
3133845,3,B0014NA52A,"If you're looking to watch a very average documentary that rambles on and on the more you watch of it, add this to your Amazon shopping cart. Sure, Emanuel Bronner has many good ideas and he's very well intentioned; but a full length documentary about him would either have to be done much more coherently or on a smaller scale than the film we have here. As another reviewer noted, this is good for about the first 30 to 45 minutes; then the repetition of the same material countless times becomes monotonous at best.

On the other hand, there are good things about this documentary. We learn about Bronner's life in Germany before he came to live in the United States in 1929; and we get the benefits of interviews with his children and his fourth wife Gladys. It's interesting to see Bronner speaking to a group of young people back in the early 1970s; they were quiet welcoming of him and despite his quirks he's generally a rather nice guy.

In addition, we learn how Bronner's soap company currently operates; they seem to truly care about people and one lady recalls how Bronner gave her a job when she couldn't type and didn't have a high school diploma; this is touching. In addition, near the end of this documentary we learn that the company also contributes 70% of its net profit to charity and that no one in management earns more than 5 times the salary of the lowest paid vested employee. That's incredible.

We also learn about Bronner as a father and a human being. We see a lot of footage of Bronner's son Ralph, who clearly thinks very highly of his dad and his dad's passion about selling his soap. Indeed, we learn that Bronner was so passionate that he would go selling soap on the road and leave his children in orphanages or foster homes seeing them only very rarely, even when it must have been apparent that the kids were being pushed around or abused outright. He's quite eccentric. I can't quite determine if he's a tad nuts; but I lean toward that because of his status as someone who escaped from a mental hospital back in the late 1940s and the way he rambles on when he speaks. It's a tough call; but if Bronner is a bit crazy he's certainly harmless. He's got a passion for helping the world by pushing his soap products; and that's not exactly the worst thing a man could ever do. Actually, leaving his kids in all those homes and orphanages is much more proof of poor judgment than anything regarding his soaps or his salesmanship skills!

The DVD comes with a few extras. The one with Bronner's grandchildren is the best in my opinion; but we also get an optional running commentary with director Sara Lamm; and there's ""an interview update"" with David Bronner. There is even a short documentary by Robin Bell entitled ""Dr. B's Fair Trade Olive Oil.""

Overall, Dr. Bronner's Magic Soapbox disappoints me somewhat; this could have been organized much, much better to target and engage more viewers. The story has noticeable gaps in it--for example, whatever happened to Bronner's 2nd and 3rd wives? On the other hand, if you like Bronner's soap products you'll probably love this film; and people who enjoy documentaries about people who march to the beat of their own drummer will definitely want this for their collections.",1250726400,,3260,4.623488773747841

8256083,3,B0014NA52A,"I have mixed feelings about this documentary.  The movie itself is pretty good, descriptive and informative without being too judgemental.  If anything, it might go too far in the direction of not casting judgement.  It might be faulted for not explaining Bronner's ""Moral ABC"", but that could be because it's not clear from his own statements exactly what it is.  What I've seen of it seems to be a mix of religious ramblings, brotherly love statements, and a lot of stuff that's not even wrong.

""Doctor"" Bronner was clearly unhinged, and his own morals weren't too clean to begin with.  He abandoned his kids at an orphanage where they were badly abused, only visiting them a couple times a year.  As a parent myself, I find that idea horrifying.  And even when he did visit them he played favorites with them.  And after all that he had the nerve to lecture people on the ""Moral ABC""?  Bullsh*t.

His kids and grandkids seem to fawn over the memory of this morally dubious guy, especially his older son Ralph, who was *not* the beneficiary of his father's playing favorites.  They sort of make excuses for him, though I suppose that's to be expected; it's hard to come down in judgement on a parent or grandparent you got to know in your life, but from the outside it looks kind of sad.

All that said, Bronner wasn't all bad.  He really did make very good soap.  I use it myself for shampoo: it's pure castile soap with no questionable ingredients and it works really well.  I admire that the family treats its workers very well, and for what it's worth, I'm glad they've chosen to leave Bronner's word salad labels on the product.  It's distinctive and quaint, and the product just wouldn't seem the same without those labels.",1489190400,,1732,4.6262295081967215

I only wish this DVD were more available; the used copy I bought would not play all the way through. Fortunately, I was able to rent and watch the entire documentary from Netflix (DVD only, no streaming).
Among this movie's revelations are the leadership role Dr Bronner's son plays in sourcing organic, fair-trade oils and the slightly uneasy relationship between the rabbi and the hippies who became his biggest customers.

I found it to be an inspirational story about a man facing some troubling issues in his life. His emigration to the United States seemed to offer promise, but his mental fixations and obsessions quickly turned him into a social outcast -- until the soap.

Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap became an underground alternative sub-culture staple, and it offered the creator a way to have his unique voice heard.
