8389020,1,B0035I822M,I was very disappointed with this video. Issam is a great drummer but if this video is typical of his teaching stay far far away. There is very little instruction on this DVD. Save your money.,1423958400,,192,4.361111111111111
8389021,1,B0035I822M,"Totally disappointing if you want a learning aid. Hand placements explained. A few exercices. A quick presentation of a few common rhythms, and that's it!  (Some extras including an interview with Issam and some melodies played with his nephews.)

From such a well-known percussionist, I was expecting more useful instruction. Capitalising on his name? Promoting his Remo doumbek? Showcasing himself?  All acceptable if the DVD was not titled as it was. VERY MISLEADING!

If you're a beginner and you want something useful, prefer Amir Naoum's :

Doumbek Technique and Rhythms for Arabic Percussion, with Amir Naoum: Beginner level Doumbek instruction, Doumbek how-to, Play Doumbek for belly dance (2006)",1392681600,3,704,5.481481481481482
8389022,3,B0035I822M,"This has a better explanation of the ""how"" to hit the doumbek than some other videos, but doesn't give enough for practice or many of the actual drum rhythms.",1385251200,,158,4.482758620689655
8389023,5,B0035I822M,"Issam Housham is a master percussionist.  My husband has been dancing with since our family started with Belly Dance and now he want's to get in on the ""men's' role and drum, so we're really into it, not just to look cute but to undestand the music and the history.  Great video, losts of drills, might take time to get really good especially with our american ways......but definitely worht it.",1327449600,,395,4.628571428571429
8389024,5,B0035I822M,"I got this video to improve my plaing skills. Plus I am a big fan of musick and musical style of Issam Houshan. It is a nice exercising/ technic video. Detailed explanation of finger positions, fingerwork, etc. Plus lot of bonus material about trip to Siria. Fun to watch, helps to develop good fastpaced technicks of playing tabla. And always interesting to study with Master.",1313366400,,377,4.815384615384615
