898197,5,6304525168,"With all respect to the wonderful Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, I feel that it's Zachary Scott, in his first film, who makes this one unforgettable. He's sinister, treacherous, vicious, and utterly amoral---and you can't take your eyes off him, any more than you could stop watching a cobra rearing up in front of you. You can see how Faye Emerson (in a memorable performance) falls in love with him.  Adapted from Eric
Ambler's spy thriller, ""A Coffin for Dimitrios,"" this was directed by Jean Negulesco, who did the quite different but equally well crafted ""Humoresque"" two years later.  We can be grateful that it's available,
if only on VHS.",1220140800,3,651,4.909090909090909
898198,5,6304525168,"This film was made in 1944, thus many of Warner Bros. so-called A-List stars were not available for making motion pictures since many were serving in the armed forces during World War II. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet usually played in support of other Warner stars, most notably Humphrey Bogart. This time, they got a film of their own, and the result is a most enjoyable and somewhat unusual film noir. Lorre plays Dutch author Cornelius Leyden who is on vacation in Istanbul when he listens to the tale of the career of legendary criminal Dimitrios Makropoulos, whose bloated body has washed ashore that day. Intrigued by the story, Leyden then begins a trek across Europe to learn all he can about Dimitrios in preparation for a book he wishes to write. Mr. Peters, played by Sydney Greenstreet, joins him in his travels. However, he has darker motivations.

Because it is set in 1938, this allows the film to avoid the subject of World War II which would make Leyden's travels impossible, but also avoids making the film a period piece by traveling only six years into the past. Zachary Scott does a good job in the title role as we learn about the extent of Dimitrios' treachery through well-done flashbacks. He seems to be a man who not only wants to steal anything not nailed down, but actually enjoys the pain he causes others. The theme seems to be that a person so completely despicable as Dimitrios must be successful for a time because few will anticipate the next move of such a treacherous individual - at least not for awhile. Thus there are obvious parallels being drawn between Dimitrios and the German leader of that time.

I saw this film on TCM the other night and it didn't look at all ready for DVD. It still had some sound problems and the video was somewhat blurry, as is often the case with older films that have been preserved but not yet restored. Thus, for now, I guess this VHS copy is all that is available. It would be great in a volume 5 set of WHV's Film Noir series.",1219536000,4,2006,4.554016620498615

The credits on this page have Warner Bros. as the releaser of this DVD, but have an odd release date of 1944 at the time I am writing this. I saw this film on TCM the other night and it didn't look at all ready for DVD. It still had some sound problems and the video was somewhat blurry, as is often the case with older films that have been preserved but not yet restored. I also keep my ear to the ground for upcoming releases of classic films, and if this studio-backed DVD release is real, then the news has somehow slipped past me. Since there isn't even a real release date, I have sincere doubts that this DVD release is real, but if it is it is overdue and quite welcome.",1218844800,21,2326,4.522565320665083
898200,5,6304525168,"After you have viewed this wonderful, exciting and atmospheric film, try reading the book (same title) by Eric Ambler.  You may find, as I did, that as good as this film is, the book is better.  A rare recommendation, since both are superb.",1209945600,3,240,4.558139534883721
898201,5,6304525168,"Objectively speaking, the narrative process of this sensational film has many issues in common with a previous film: citizen Kane and another later picture: The third man. But a personal advise; you are watching a film based on a novel of Eric ambler, and this is a very relevant aspect to underline, due the fatal perspective according the British thrillers overlooks the existential consequences and focuses with major sharpness the transcendence of a criminal mind over the public opinion.

A humble and forgotten writer - Cornelius Latimer Leyden - is intrigued when the Istanbul police chief shows him the murdered body of Dimitrios a criminal with a background worthy to appear on the Record Guinness. And because if that Cornelius knows he may find a very rewarding lode to make some money and (at last!) to be acknowledged by the rest of the world.

The rest of this tense story runs for you. Jean Negulesco would direct two others Noir films, Nobody lives forever and Road house, but at least to my mind this was his best achievement.",1157673600,3,1043,4.853932584269663

898203,5,6304525168,"Superb film noir classic, thanks to a classy script (based closely on Eric Ambler's fine novel) and excellent acting. Vacationing mystery writer Peter Lorre becomes intrigued with the despicable criminal Dimitrios Makropoulos (played by Zachary Scott) after his murdered body washes up on the beach. Sydney Greenstreet also displays an interest in Dimitrios, and as the plot unfolds we are led into a complex mixture of false identity, espionage, blackmail, and assassination. Lorre surprises completely with his very sympathetic role played to perfection, and Greenstreet is also wonderful as the sinister though amiable Mr. Peters. Everything clicks in this production, and the results are truly satisfying. Definitely worth a watch.",1150588800,7,735,5.6909090909090905
898204,4,6304525168,"This 1940's film noir mystery features the successful collaboration of the heavy lidded Peter Lorre and the corpulent Sydney Greenstreet.
A macerated body washes up on the shores of the Bosphorus in Istanbul.  The bloated body bears the identification of Dimitrios Makropoulos, a European criminal legend.  The discovery of the corpse piques the interest of Lorre, a detective story novelist.  He embarks on a journey through Europe to investigate the criminal exploits of Makropoulos played well by Randolph Scott.  Along the way he encounters Greenstreet, who he forms an alliance with to eventually find out what really happened.  Edward Cianelli is excellent playing an aristocratic Yugoslavian spymaster.
This was a fun film to watch with a nice combination of actors of this era.",1036886400,21,785,5.349593495934959
898205,4,6304525168,"The body of Dimitrios Makropoulos washes up on the shore of Istanbul, and his history of crimes is brought to the attention of mystery writer Peter Lorre.  Dimitrios was a man without a conscience, always looking to make money at the expense of anyone.  Lorre becomes fascinated by his story, and goes on a quest to find out more about the much despised man.  The quest takes him across Europe, to such locales as Sofia, Geneva, and Paris.  Along the way he gets involved with Sydney Greenstreet, a menacing man who clearly knows more than he is saying, with motives of his own.  The story is partly told through a series of flashbacks, as victims of Dimitrios' schemes and backstabbing relate their experiences.  This is another example of film noir, with the action taking place at night, in dark spaces.  Everyone has questionable motives and characters, each looking out for themselves.  Lorre is good in an offbeat role, and it's entertaining to watch him with the always fun Greenstreet - what an odd couple.  Zachary Scott is appropriately menacing and nasty as Dimitrios, and Steven Geray is particularly good as one of Dimitrios' unfortunate victims.  I did get occasionally confused during the flashbacks, but not enough to detract from the overall film.  It quickly establishes a dark, sinister mood, and doesn't let up.  This is a forgotten thriller that deserves to be seen.",1028332800,33,1387,4.905579399141631

I was hoping it would one day be brought out on DVD, and finally it has.  This is a wonderful film for Peter Lorre who plays a mystery writer named Cornelius Leyden who is drawn into past crimes and double dealing of Dimitrios Makropoulos.  Sydney Greenstreet is equally wonderful as the mysterious and unpredictable Mr. Peters, and Zachary Scott makes a fearsome Dimitrios, whose past history is related, bit by bit, to Leyden by his victims.  Faye Emerson is excellent as Irana Preveza, who had the misfortune of falling in love with Dimitrious.

Warner Brothers had many wonderful actors under contract and the casting of the supporting roles, many of whom are familiar from other classic films, in Dimitrios is superb. The film is also beautifully photographed by veteran Cinematographer Arthur Edeson, who also photographed The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca.

898626,4,6304525168,Ambler's story of Dimitrios is one of the great espionage and political thrillers of the pre-WWII era and essentially defined the genre for modern writers.

898627,4,6304525168,"The Mask of Dimitrios is a relative rarity for its time in that it follows Eric Ambler's book faithfully. The only major change is to accommodate Peter Lorre. In the book the character was an English writer; here he has been made Dutch to cover Lorre's accent. No big deal Another minor difference is the hapless bureaucrat Dimitrios hustles. In the movie they say he committed suicide, in the book he went to prison. This is great material for a movie, but jean Negulesco's direction is rather pedestrian which prevents it from earning 5 stars. Still you can't go wrong with Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet in a classic movie. The reproduction is less than pristine in that not much effort was given to restoration, but in this case it doesn't detract from the period piece very much. It is definitely worth watching. One of the main reasons you buy a DVD is so you can watch it more than once, and this one is well worth it on that score.

898661,2,6304525168,"Eric Ambler's admirable book is given a flaccid treatment. Teaming Greenstreet and Lorre (evidently to capitalize on their success in ""The Maltese Falcon"") in this particular vehicle was a mistake, mainly because Lorre is ill suited to the part of the writer wandering into an intrigue that takes him well out of his depth. The story stands or falls on the rather effete and complacent narrator, who goes in search of story material but bites off more than he knows, and neither director Negulesco or Lorre seem to understand this. As a result, the pursuit of Dimitrios, and the many necessary flashbacks, becomes a rather tedious, if not pointless, bit of film-making. The twist, if you can call it that, in the story is predictable (Ambler understands this, and he does not base his story on the pretence that it is otherwise), so there has to be another ""pull"" factor to keep the viewer engaged. The Lorre character (a useful comparison might be Holly Martin in ""The Third Man"") needs to be that ""pull"" factor. Here, he isn't.",1390521600,4,1029,4.786516853932584

The movie is based on Eric Ambler's novel, ""A Coffin for Dimitrios.""  I suppose the studio suits decided that the title had to be softened a bit.

This was Zachary Scott's first film, and he walks away with it, even with the presence of such wonderful actors as Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.

But, Sydney (Mr Peters) knows better.  So many unforgettable and quotable lines from the Peters character.  I love this film!  It takes place in Istanbol; but, they follow Dimitrios trail through Europe, encountering people who have stories to share in flashbacks of this charming, cold blooded character, Dimitrios (Zachary Scott).",1339113600,6,1154,4.673267326732673
898753,4,6304525168,"I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, but it's not perfect, and I can see how some people wouldn't like it.

The story is definitely interesting, and puts a great spin on the ""fascinating murderer"" character-type. Peter Lorre stars as Cornelius Leyden, a mystery author tracking the career of the assassin Dimitrios (Zachery Scott), as inspiration for his next novel.  Leyden is as fascinated by Dimitrios as many of us are by villains from stories or history.  But his opinion changes as he interviews all the people who were hurt by Dimitrios. Then things get more complicated when a shady man named Peters (Sydney Greenstreet) starts stalking Leyden, with his own reasons for learning about Dimitrios.

Though the story is interesting and fun, it's not pulled off perfectly. The acting is very odd; it keeps switching back and forth from great to bad. One minute, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Faye Emerson, or Zachery Scott will be giving a fantastic performance, making their characters believable and sympathetic...and the next minute, they're giving a performance worthy of ""The Phantom Menace."" I don't know if the monotone moments were there intentionally, for some reason, or of the director just cared about some scenes more than others. It's baffling. I've seen plenty of old movies where great actors share scenes with bad ones, but not a movie where it's the same actors switching back and forth between great and...not-great.

That being said, the acting is never *horrible.*  Just monotone or unbelievable, at times.  The actors still make it a fun movie.  For fans of Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet, this movie is a must-see.  Peter Lorre takes on a role very unlike his others, in which he plays a *good guy,* who's only *kind of* creepy. He gives Leyden a dark and eccentric spin that makes perfect sense for a crime novelist, and makes for a MUCH more interesting protagonist than the typical ""average-Joe"" that movies usually use for their leads. Greenstreet meanwhile is far better in this semi-vulnerable, anti-hero type of role than the ""powerful"" villain he plays (or tries to play) in some of his other movies (*cough* ""Maltese Falcon""). Lorre and Greenstreet play off each other humorously, bouncing some priceless expressions off each other (as well as some arguably gay subtext).

There are great visuals if you're a fan of film noir. Cool shadows, exotic locations, and extravagant 1940s fashions (every scene with Faye Emerson had me saying, ""I WANT that dress!""). There isn't much action-fighting, but there is plenty of fun sneaking around, pulling guns on people, and blackmail.

You can't watch ""The Mask of Dimitrios"" with a totally serious mind, like ""Casablanca"" or ""M."" Maybe the movie is dated, or maybe it was *meant* to be tongue-in-cheek. I suspect that to really enjoy this movie, you need to already be a fan of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. If you're looking for something serious and powerful, I don't think this movie will do it for you. But if you are going to watch ""The Mask of Dimitrios,"" have fun with it.

(I must also agree with many other fans here: WHERE IS THE DVD? These old noir movies look awesome on a high-deff TV, and this movie would probably be no exception. If there's ever a petition to get ""Mask of Dimitrios"" on DVD, I'll be signing it.)",1330387200,3,3323,4.903743315508021

As Peter Lorre becomes more and more enmeshed in the past life (and death?) of Dimitrios (played as a classic sociopath by the saturnine Zachary Scott), his own existence becomes imperiled. All this in glorious black and white. Please, someone, put this on DVD!!",1328313600,4,769,5.16
898755,2,6304525168,"""The Mask of Dimitrios"" is a 1944 black and white crime melodrama set in Europe featuring Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and (in his first film) Zachary Scott. It was directed by Romanian Jean Negulesco and was based on the 1939 Eric Ambler novel ""A Coffin for Dimitrious"".

Eric Ambler (1909-98) was a British spy novelist and later Hollywood screenwriter. His works include ""Journey into Fear"" (1940), ""The October Man"" (1947), and ""This Gun for Hire"" (1967). Ambler was well known for using amateurs as his protagonists and throwing them into situations for which they are ill prepared. His works bordered on film noir, but the hero often survived with little except the harrowing experience.

The plot in this film follows Ambler's basic format. A writer (Lorre) is intrigued by the career of a criminal (Scott) recently found dead and visits various locations throughout Europe to learn more about him. In the process he meets various unsavory characters and teams up with a former associate of Dimitrios (Greenstreet) who believes that he isn't dead.

Zachary Scott (1914-65) makes his screen debut following a distinguished stage career. Scott made a career playing scoundrels in films like ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945), ""Ruthless"" (1948) and ""Flamingo Road"" (1949). In the 50s he transitioned to TV.

Sydney Greenstreet (1879-1954) is everyone's favorite fat man despite having made only 22 films and his film career lasted a mere 8 years. But these films included ""The Maltese Falcon"" (for which he was nominated for an Oscar), ""Casablanca"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""Flamingo Road"" and ""Passage to Marseille"".

Greenstreet's partner in crime in ""The Maltese Falcon"", Peter Lorre (1904-64) joins him once more, in the 5th of their 8 collaborations. Lorre gained prominence as the child molester in Fritz Lang's ""M"" (1931) and went on to fame as ""Mr. Moto"" in a series of 8 detective films between 1937 and 1939.

Glamorous Faye Emerson (1917-1983) achieved her fame on TV in the 50s, but she had an active film career in the 40s in films like ""Between Two Worlds"" (1944), ""Nobody Lives Forever"" (1946) and ""Out of the Fog"" (1941). Emerson plays a former lover of Scott.

This was the second film for director Jean Negulesco (1900-93) who went on to earn an Oscar nomination for ""Johnny Belinda"" (1955) and win a BAFTA for ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" (1959). He specialized in films that take place in Europe (""Three Coins in a Fountain"", ""Boy on a Dolphin"", ""Britannia Mews"").

The film is wonderfully shot by Arthur Edeson (1891-1970) who did some spectacular work in the silent era (""Robin Hood"", ""The Thief of Bagdad"", ""The Lost World"") and worked on the first sound film shot outside a studio, ""In Old Arizona"" (1929). Edeson is perhaps best known for his stunning work with James Whale in the early 30s (""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"",  ""The Invisible Man"") which shows the influence of German expressionism on his film technique. He was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""In Old Arizona"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Casablanca"") but incredibly never won.

1944 was not a strong year for films. ""Going my Way"" was the big multiple Oscar winner.  ""Gaslight"" did well at the box office and won Ingrid Bergman an Oscar. Other notable films were Judy Garland's ""Meet me in St Louis"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Arsenic and Old Lace"". War films were popular - ""Lifeboat"", ""Since You Went Away"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""Hollywood Canteen"", ""The Fighting Seabees"", ""Ministry of Fear"", ""Passage to Marseille"", and ""The Fighting Sullivans"". Film noir flourished in the 40s, especially the mid 40s. 1944 film noir included ""Double Indemnity"", ""Laura"", ""Ministry of Fear"", ""Murder My Sweet"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""Dark Waters"", ""Woman in the Window"", and ""Phantom Lady"".

Bosley Crowther of the NY Times  said ""this screen adaptation is no great credit to either"" Warners nor Ambler because ""the film wallows deeply in discourse and tediously trite flashbacks."" He did praise the ""atmosphere"" and the ""international haunts and Balkan dives"", but didn't like Lorre and felt Scott ""presents the rascally Dimitrios as a blue-steel American gangster type.""

This is not film noir as some has opined, although it does have many of the film noir characteristics (photography, sleazy cast of characters, innocent lured into tangled web) but lacks some defining themes (femme fatale, negative consequences for the innocent).

There are several problems with the film, the most important one being that no one is fooled by the faked death of Dimitrios at the start of the film. Moreover, the chemistry between Greenstreet and Lorre seems forced, or perhaps we've simply seen it before and better, so this time it seems to lack the spark it had in earlier films. Using Lorre as the protagonist was a risky choice - apart from his success as the Japanese detective, Lorre was best in the character role, and usually a character with a shady or at least mysterious past. As the hero, he leaves much to be desired, which is a central problem for the film. And Scott is not such a scoundrel that we are rooting for him either. Thus, we have a film in search of a hero.

Bottom line - a failed attempt to bring Ambler's novel to life.",1319414400,3,5227,4.963386727688787

Zachary Scott makes his film debut as the thoroughly odious title character. Lorre plays a writer of mystery novels. When a body, ostensibly that of Dimitrios, washes up on the shores of the Bosporus, Lorre becomes intrigued by the totally amoral life he has reportedly led and decides it would make a good basis for a novel. He sets out to learn more about the mysterious Dimitrios. His search leads him all over Europe and the story of Dimitrios' life unfolds in ""flashback"" accounts from various people who have been victimized by Dimitrios. Sidney Greenstreet plays a man who was double-crossed by Dimitrios. He informs Lorre that the man who washed up on the beach was not Dimitrios and that he remains very much alive. Greenstreet forms an alliance with Lorre to extract revenge and promises Lorre 500,000 French francs for his assistance. I like this film a lot. Again, it is well-paced and the story of ""Dimitrios"" unfolds in a manner which makes it hard for the viewer to lose interest. Scott is quite good as the title character---a type he would play many times in his career. Greenstreet and Lorre are, as usual, a perfect pairing.
