4540067,5,B0053O89YM,"I really admire Peter Florek's gambit in this show.  He suspects that Will Gardner is as morally bankrupt as he is.  He is setting up a prosecution of Will for some very dicey dealings he had with  judges and gambling. But I suspect he is doing it to show that Will has no more loyalty to Alicia than he did. He suspects, as do I, that Will Will dump Alicia in order to save himself. And what I expect to see happen is for Alicia to runright over to Michael J. Fox's law firm and take him up on his job offer from last season. And that will upset everyone's apple cart in this show.

I am equally fascinated by Peter's mother, who seems to be living in a time warp.  She snoops through Alicia's things,including her computer, to get evidence to use against her to get sole custody for Peter. Peter is surely unaware of this as the last thing he wants is a controversial child custody hearing airing their further dirty laundry. Eli, in fact, would hit the ceiling if he learned of it. The reason Jackie is living in a time warp is challenging the custody of two teenagers, one close to college age, borders on the laughable. Jackie is living back in the fifties or sixties and Eli has already warned her about that.

Special mention must be made of Christine Baranski as the other senior law partner.  She is doing a knockout job in her role as Diane Lockheart.",1321920000,2,1361,4.334645669291339
4540068,5,B0053O89YM,"The case itself is pretty interesting this time.  In order to help one client accused of murder, she has to try to get a stay of execution for a well deserving inmate whose execution date looms. This was extremely refreshing in that the writers did not try to sugarcoat the realities of the con on death row.  He is a repulsive human being.  Nevertheless his mother is willing to get on the stand and call herself a lousy parent just to get him a stay.  The local priest is willing to do the same since he is opposed to his being executed. And our scenes with him only makes us wish he were being strapped down NOW!  This is very rare with death penalty portrayals either in movies or tv. So bravo to GOOD WIFE.

Meanwhile, conflicts on the home-office front complicate everyone's lives. Diane is extremely suspicious about Alicia and Will. Jackie, Peter's mother, is intent on causing trouble, as usual. She has to be the blindest parent in Chicago since all she ever sees are Alicia's flaws and never Peter's. The kids themselves are three years older and no longer dewy eyed about their parents, although their parents fall to notice this.  You can now see the young adults they will become. And Eli remains Eli, doing his thing, and thus one of my favorite characters. The conflict between the firm detective and Alicia seems to be on the back burner for awhile. Frankly, I think they should both conclude that Peter is not worth a second more of anyone's conflict with anyone else.",1321401600,,1486,4.56390977443609
4540069,5,B0053O89YM,"The most interesting development to my mind was well developed in this episode.  This is that Will Gardner may be every bit as bad a choice for romantic interest as Peter Florek proved to be.  Most series tv would have never let Alicia and Will start having an affair.  That's because the creators would be thinking in terms of ""happy ever after"" which is synonymous with the ""the end"" in series tv. Not so here.  This is a series willing to take risks.

We learn, for example, that Will once embezzled from a client's account to cover his gambling debts. Then, in one case against the government, which Alicia is trying with Diane, Alicia is put in a precarious position with the government.  When she consults with Will and Diane about it, her concern grows that they are more interested in protecting the firm than in protecting her.

There is a high bit of comedy here too if you have been watching all seasons.  The two most shark like lawyers have been Michael J. Fox's character and Carey's friend who became a house husband. These two make terrific long term husbands and fathers.  Will and Peter are considerably less talented as lawyers and they both make rotten husbands and father material. They can't leave their viciousness and game on the playing field of the courtroom. Alicia is thus a flawed heroine too as she is solely attracted to the wrong men as husbands and father material.",1320710400,,1398,4.650406504065041
4540070,5,B0053O89YM,"I love this show so the only thing I am viewing with some dismay is that they seem to be taking on Cuddy from the HOUSE MD show.  Lisa Edelstein, the actress, plays an attorney who is a thousand times more annoying than Cuddy, the hospital administrator and doctor from HOUSE.  And, of all things, she is a former love interest of Will Gardener's!

Other than that, the show is great though.  Alicia has a murder case this time out.  There is a lot of tension in the firm over just about everything.  Eli is insisting on getting more and more assistance and since he is paying the firm big, he is a hard guy to deny. Diane thinks the firm needs to bring in a bankruptcy division because of the economy.  It is the one specialty that does extremely well in bad times.

Although the rift between the two women still hasn't been smoothed, I personally think we are getting set up for a much bigger rift to open up between Alicia and the firm through her current involvement with Will. And when that explodes, she also must still contend with her vendetta seeking husband and his new henchman, Carey. Actually, Alicia would probably do a lot better with her career if she worked for the Michael J. Fox character or for Eli since these are men who do not interest her romantically nor are they interested in her romantically.

I will be staying tuned each week.",1319241600,,1356,4.435483870967742
4540231,3,B0053O89YM,"Starting into season three. I keep watching this show in the hopes that something will happen. They keep dragging the same story-line out. Alicia keeps winning cases in a ludicrous way, at the last minute. Calinda keeps finding things very easily that the police overlook. There is no such thing as conflict of interest at this law firm - this very large firm that seems to only have 4 lawyers work on cases - the partners, the divorce attorney, and Alicia (allegedly still just a 3rd year associate, but an expert on every type of law!). I'm also still trying to figure out how Alicia thinks she can keep her separation and her affair from anyone, when she and Peter seem to be incredibly well known. I very much enjoy the Eli character but I'm pretty sure he will grow tiresome as he has now joined the firm.",1491091200,,810,4.47972972972973

4540234,4,B0053O89YM,"This series is a fascinating display of the moral turpitudes of licensed professional liars.  It is especially interesting in that it focuses on Al Capone's hometown Chicago and connects to many quite modern felonious abrogators of the human and civil rights of American citizens including the illegally seizing of the property of American citizens, in violation of Article IV of the US Constitution Amendments, ""Treasury"" Department which pretends that its own feloniously slopperated ""computer"" systems are to be the exclusive record of their debt drunk squandrous wastrel debts.  At one point it mentions that anyone interviewing a licensed professional liar can typically discover *which* felonies induced that ""lawyer"" to become one, something which I had long since recognized. It is an engaging, well photographed, acted, directed, and produced television series.",1488326400,,870,5.684615384615385

4541740,3,B0053O89YM,"The first several episodes were silly and disappointing. The only attention to the much anticipated love affair was over the scandal and not the romance. The lead characters have so much chemistry, they deserved more onscreen time alone together. Then the subplots with Eli Stone, at least in the beginning, seem to provide fluff, comic relief, instead of substance. But it's not all bad; and the season definitely improves by episode 7. In this show, I love how the characters play off each other's personalities, and how the cases provide so many questions of right and wrong and in between. So much to wrestle with--in a safe, fictional way--providing questions and issues that can linger in the real world.",1480809600,,710,4.974789915966387

Without it, one has to manually move from one episode to the next.  The Amazon Video tech person was not helpful at all in resolving this issue.  It was a time consuming ordeal and not a good outcome.  This feature is still not working and when I have another hour or so, I will reach our to Amazon tech support to try to get this issue resolve.

Let me declare first that I am no fond of lawyers. Alicia Florrick, played by Juliana Margulies, isn't a sympathetic character. The series had some outrageous situation, totally unbelievable, like a state attorney, sleeping with a prostitute ( and the video gone viral) gets re-elected as the state attorney. By the third season, I ended up hating every character. I wish I can sensor the TV program so that I can only watch the court room scenes.",1464825600,,584,5.030927835051546

4544832,4,B0053O89YM,"Wow, really good!  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I'll describe as best I can.  They are really keeping it fresh this season and there's A LOT going on.  There's all kinds of ""happenings"" with Peter, Alicia, and Will.  The mother in law Jackie is even more of a ""pain in the buns"".  There's a great line where Eli tells her, ""calm down Jackie, it's not the 50's"".  I love that guy and they are keeping him busy too.

In the 1st season, I didn't care for Cary Agos.  By the end of the second season, he started to grow on me.  During this season, they really evolve his character...and it's a great story to watch.

Other notable highlights:  one episode has a return to military court...and it's so good!  It's interesting and funny, but also very heartfelt about the case itself and the outcome.  Another interesting episode is about bitcoin, the digital currency...or is it a commodity?  (Legal joke - ha!).

The only reason for 4 stars vs. 5 stars is there seems to be a few too many new characters to keep track of.  I often found myself thinking - ""Where did they come from?  Do I need to pay attention to them...?

The last episode is an absolute cliffhanger !!!  Happy watching !!!",1464566400,,1196,4.4036697247706424

A fifteen minute segment would end each week with the hero or heroin facing a serious situation that may have taken the hero's life or injured them seriously.  However, each new episode would begin with an amazing escape and a continuation of the adventure.  Yes, I enjoy The Good Wife, but, unfortunately, she has become predictable.

4546194,3,B0053O89YM,"The Good Wife is a much acclaimed TV series, and does have a number of interesting characters- Kalinda probably being the most provocative. However, as one continues to watch the show. the story line becomes both tedious and a bit unbelievable. The courtroom ""drama"" is just that- drama. It has absolutely no connection to reality. I know that these types of shows--doctors, lawyers, firemen-- are often far from accurate, but the good Wife does border on the ridiculous. The law firm politics are also quite overblown. I do like many of the characters, but they seem to transform into caricatures as the seasons pass. The series does hold one's attention, as we always want to see ""what happens next"", but it is a flawed experience.",1456704000,6,733,4.872

I like character driven fiction and there are enough characters in both these shows to make me watch the same shows over and over. Chloe & Kalinda are two of the most well-developed, weirdoes ever to fascinate me. It takes real genius to balance character and plot without distorting the fabric of the whole show. The GW crew does it show after show. What is so good about this show, is that there is seldom a shooting, or a car chase and the characters are almost never naked or engaged in ridiculous, hyper sex. The characters in this show are smart, sexy, well-educated, and complex. Pretty much the same description as the characters in 24. One show gave me Nina Myers; the other gave me Richard Lee. Thanks to 24 and TGW, the genera of TV is not all talking heads and air-balls; instead, it is, sometimes, art.",1454198400,2,921,4.455621301775148

The one thing I don't like is periodically they sneak in extremely  anti-christian sentiments as part of a story line.  They ask as if they are much too sophisticated to have anything to do with God.  For example, when the main character became interested in Christianity and spoke with a pastor, you would have thought something terrible was happening.  When they viewed him praying, the look on their faces was like you would expect if someone had just found out their loved one was an ax murderer or something.",1445731200,,657,4.873873873873874

4548271,5,B0053O89YM,"This show was amazing from the very first episode and season 3 continues that trend. To me, the big message of season 3 was that every action has consequences no matter how big or small, personal or professional, truth or lie. You see that with pretty much every character in a multitude of ways. I really like the scenes with the siblings like the ones between Alicia and Owen or Will and his sisters because you're able to see glimpses into the characters that you wouldn't see otherwise. I would've liked to have seen more with Alicia and Will and the relationship but I feel that's like true life too because you don't always get the closure you need even if you see that person every day. As much as it pains me to say it since I really like Alicia and Will, I think season 3 gave Alicia time to grow a bit professionally without her being always an extension of Will. And I think she needed that as a career woman. Although that scene at the end when they're counting down midnight to mark his suspension being over, you see him drinking and clinking glasses with Diane, which was a great scene and I loved how she stood up to everyone and went to bat for Will this season and even how she stood up to the others for Alicia this season, and Alicia standing outside in the empty offices holding what looks like champagne with ribbons. She's watching them having drinks and it's sad, sad because she doesn't walk in there, she just drops the bottle on table and leaves and sad that if it would've been season 1, she would've been the one he was drinking with. I can't wait to see how the actions and consequences shake themselves out in season 4.",1444089600,,1650,4.37785016286645

4548288,5,B0053O89YM,"I kept hearing this show was excellent - so I was happy to see it come to Amazon Prime from Season 1.  This show is entirely different than I expected, and really quite good.  Interesting courtroom cases which always makes for a good show, but even better is the cast of characters who have all been fleshed out with complexity.  This show also does a great job of introducing secondary characters - such as judges and opposing council - and bringing them back again and again which not only seems realistic, but also really adds to the entire world built by this show.  The Good Wife gets almost everything right - sometimes shows like this build a lot of great supporting cast members but the actual main character is my least favorite (I'm looking at you ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Gray's Anatomy"") but here Alicia Florrick has a fairly unimpeachable moral center, she really is ""The Good Wife"" while also being very well rounded, totally sympathetic and completely likable.  Her kids are also likable and still realistic. And really, the whole series is worth watching just for Elsbeth Tascioni who should get a spinoff.

This isn't the type of television moment like the Sopranos or Breaking Bad - instead it is comfort food television that goes down very easy but you are happy to find that it has a lot more nutritional value than these types of shows usually do.",1443312000,2,1372,4.648760330578512

You cannot ask for better actors, it continuously brings well known actors but the less known ones do not dissapoint either. Everything here comes together to want you to continue to season 4. The writing and story line keeps the good wife going through changes in her personal life as well as her life as a lawyer which you sometimes makes you ask if indeed the main character is the good wife. So far as this season ends it will leave craving for season four.",1443139200,,585,4.376146788990826

Personally, this is one of the best, roller coaster rides that I've had the pleasure of watching.  It is riveting and keeps me addicted requiring a fix; a dose of unparalleled excitement. A myriad of emotions are stirred and the acting superb. My will fall in and out of love with each character and some a hint of feeling sorry of their persona.  Season 5, Episode 16, was an explosion of intense emotions, and heartbreaking events.  We have become so involved with the characters as if they are family.

This is not a disease in and of itself, It is caused by side effects from some anti-psychotic drugs, and is not reversible, neither is it deadly. Michael has none of the facial contortions of Tardive Dyskinesia. He does have Parkinson's,  I have seen people suffering PD, I do not note any of the classics of PD symptom unless the tablets he is taking for PD caused Tardive Dyskineasia. and it is not a very convincing show of it. It is very confusing for the non-lay person and unauthentic. Does he limp or shuffle? Does he pill role or has any new medication come on the market to help with some of his PD symptoms. He makes some remarks that are very inaccurate regarding his disease process. It would be more feasible if the writers would get it right. Although I liked him as an actor before, I do  not like his role as Louis Canning on ""The Good Wife"". The rest of it is great.",1441929600,,970,4.324175824175824

But Season 3 delved into what has come to be the major theme throughout, paranoia. The absolute self interest first attitude of all of the characters, including the Good Wife, has made this a study of all of the values that Americans hold dear.

4548874,4,B0053O89YM,"This is my show I like to watch, but you send this to my husbands email and he dose not watch.  This show is the best I've seen in awhile, but they can certainly leave out some of the gay/lesbian crap, I don't like to watch that stuff, but good actors/actresses, Alisha is my favorite, she is an excellent actress. Don't like Chris Noth as her hubby, he is ugly for her. However he does a good job on the show, I guess I just want her to be with Will, but I'm not sure he is good enoiugh.  Love Carey Augos, he is good in this show, I remember him from another show, Love Kalinda she must have a closet full of Sexy Jackets and push-up bras. Like Diane she also is great to watch and plays her part well.  overall content keeps you glued and it is a good storyline.",1439164800,,765,4.019736842105263

4548951,4,B0053O89YM,"Solid writing, but the main protagonist (Alicia) is just too hard to relate to at times.  Introducing her mother's character helps the viewer understand the tumultuous background from which she emerged, and sheds light on some of her stupid emotional decisions, but the writing is otherwise some of the best that exists for television.  Makes sense that Ridley Scott is a major influence.  Most of his writing is fairly complex, even if not highly refined.  Still far superior to the majority of producers.",1438819200,,506,5.0602409638554215

4549101,5,B0053O89YM,"From season 1 until now, my wife and I have been mesmerized, often bingeing on three episodes at a time. It all begins with the writing: sharp, layered, nuanced, surprising, and adult. The characters are flawed, quirky, original, and mostly likable (with one exception: Nick). Casting is superb. From the core cast to the guest star visitors, they are just right. Even the various judges are far more than predictable stick figures. On to direction. As front stories and back stories co-exist, the directors keep the pace so involving that one hardly dares blink, let alone drift away for a beer. Television simply doesn't get any better than The Good Wife. Fasten your seat belts.",1437436800,,681,4.930434782608696

What could be better
In terms of legal reality - yeah, they are probably far from it",1435536000,,390,4.144736842105263

However, it is clear that,the writer have a liberal agenda when they had an episode that addressed their opinions regarding the case in Indiana of a Christian baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian wedding. I, as a CHristian, grow very weary of the LGBT agenda being shoved down my throat through every TV show I like when only a small percentage of our population is LGBT. No other section of our population gets the attention of the media that this group does, and frankly, there are other much more worthy injustices going on in our nation such as human trafficking that we should be crying from the rooftops about than a person's sexual preference.",1434672000,,715,4.59375

Several cases Lockhart Gardner worked on were really intriguing, like the British case, the death row case, the military case, and many others. Plus, this season featured a lot more of my favorite villain, Louis Canning. Then there were all the inter-office politics at Lockhart Gardner as well as the giant case the state's attorney's office spent half the season working on (if you've seen season 3, you know what I'm talking about.) I'm hoping season 4 can top this one!",1433894400,,592,4.701923076923077

And the court cases are often, not always, very interesting.  Alicia, the main character, is wonderful and is developing over the seasons:  usually even keeled but every now and then, she sticks it to someone in the courtroom or even better, outside, and you cheer!  Passionate Eli Gold is always good for a tantrum or two:  love that character!  And Jackie, the mother-in-law, is so consistently infuriating that you gotta love her too.  Even the kids are well developed characters with 2 very good actors.  Kalinda Sharma is definitely complex, hidden, and just plain scary because she is fierce and willing to do pretty much anything to get the job done.  Chris Noth as ""the bad husband"" Peter, is always good to look at and is a true politician who is a true fighter who deeply loves his family.  Most of the characters are so deeply flawed in so many ways, but almost all of them make me root for them at some point, and for me, that makes for a great show!",1426723200,,1113,4.433497536945813

I don't know how many families there are where husband and wife are on opposite sides of the legal fence. I would imagine that most people who read these reviews already know that Alicia Florrick is a defense lawyer while her husband is State District Attorney for Chicago (Cook County). I saw most of these episodes when they were first run, and I'm thoroughly enjoying watching these the second time around.

4550000,5,B0053O89YM,"This is one of the best shows ever to hit the airways! It's about a group of high profile attorneys, but the main focus is on a States Attorney and his wife. He is caught in a sex scandal that forces his wife to question her commitment to their marriage. They have two teenage children, who's also inadvertenly caught up in the drama of this. Also, two mother-in laws who grace us with their presence. One, who is quite nosey and competative with the States Attorney's wife, and the other who is completely carefree, but has outrageous notions and antics about how children should be raised. Neither of which the teenagers mother approves of but puts up with. In addition, it's about a high profile law firm called Lockhart/Gardner, the firm where the States Attorney's wife work. And how her life is intertwined with different individuals who also work for this firm, including how she becomes involved with one of the partners. All this among cases that Lockhart/Gardner must bring to trial. Juicy stuff. I highly recommend this show to anyone!",1424390400,2,1046,4.7845303867403315

I'm into the third season and only become more amazed at Julianna Margulies portrayal of a wronged wife as she makes, daily, hourly decisions about her future, her family and her place in a world she had only skirted for the previous 13 years. Nothing is as simple and clear-cut as it might seem when you are on the outside, looking in. I think that by the end of the series (and I hope that is not for a long time to come!), Alicia will have gained a great deal of insight into her husband's downfall, and see how close she has come to walking the same path.

I watched the first episode of season one because it is free for Prime members and I was bored and needed something to fill the time one evening...and that was all it took. I am hooked now. In fact I have a hard time imagining what my TV viewing life will be like after I've seen all the episodes in all the seasons. I guess it's still running on CBS and might last for many more years, but I'm not good with commercial interruptions (or even fast-forwarding through the breaks).

The acting is good enough. Not great but very competent. The writing per each episode is well above average.

4550077,3,B0053O89YM,"For commercial TV it isn't bad.
The heroine is not a good wife. Not a terribly interesting character and portrayed in a very 1-dimensional manner. A pasty white, big headed blob that has no opinion but does love her children although she never does anything with them. The Diana Lockhart character is well played by Baranski put again she is just another lawyer and very very predictable. BTW, all the characters sleep with anything that walks. A typical soap opera with lawyers.

The side characters are good ...Eli and Amy Sedaris; Howard...and all the Judges - they add some spice and non-repetitive acting, even a little good dialog - which is sorely missing in most episodes. The show fits into a typical format and its a good waste of 45 minutes....over 100+ episodes. Ugh.",1422576000,,779,4.813432835820896

4550151,4,B0053O89YM,"Seasons 1 and 2 were much stronger, story-wise. Season 3 is still top-notch with excellent performances and overall story-arcs, but for my money, the episode by episode legal cases, and the personal encounters they contained, were less satisfying overall than I felt from Seasons 1 and 2. I say this from having started by watching Season 6. Then backtracking to all of Season 5, both of which have been just solid and outstanding... And they prompted me to go all the way back to the start, and watch from the beginning. So, in a crazy way, I am experiencing the series with more context than even the writers/showrunners had when Season 3 was airing, and thus surely when they were writing it. I was glad to be done with the two competing detectives of Season 2.... but that got replaced by other season-conflict-agents. I am really being nit-picky here, and I have not delved far into Season 4 yet... just 3 episodes into it right now, and so I'm not sure whether I will feel the same awe I felt from Season 1 and Season 2.

Having said all this, Season 3 continued with the show's trademark features including quirky but real personalities of the various judges in courtrooms and their impacts on proceedings, and with the whole depiction of internet video posts going viral and how they impact political campaigns, religious and non-religious beliefs and the very unusual for network-TV central character of Alicia being unapologetically a non-religious person, and the interesting current day phenomena that the writers weave into their stories such as Bitcoin the new digital currency.

4550180,5,B0053O89YM,I don't usually rate things but I have to say my husband and I love this show. It is witty and serious at the same time and the characters are staying true to who they started out to be in the beginning. We also love the way that they don't spend 5 episodes on the same thing but will have one show and skip around and then come back to story line which keeps us watching so we can find out about a previous saga.,1419292800,,413,3.8705882352941177

Has the aspect of a crime drama, with the laws broken involved in these crimes, and how the lawyers use their investigative skills, knowledge of the law, and creativity to defend their clients, whom sometimes are wrongfully accused. Not to mention, the added bonus of the scandals and drama that Alicia is involved with because of her husband, the State's Attorney.

I mean, youve seen on TV more than a few silly babes with too much exposed skin, and bitchy older
women who are so neurotically-disabled their husbands cheating with babes seems almost justified.
Finally, here we have a female lead whos quite smart and great-on-her-feet in the marvelous headlines-
relavent courtroom scenes. Yet as signaled by the series title, the background story arc shows us how
she adjusts privately and publicly (hes a public figure, also in the law) to her husbands betrayal. Though
well-controlled, you can see on her face how her feelings subtly appear, how shes subject to her attractions,
fears, friendships and even lust, while remaining grounded in her values of tolerance and loyalty,
 including her no-longer-fashionable respect for her marriage vows, the family welfare of her two
deeply-loved children and her jockying position in her evolving law firm. This series remains a delight,
and deserves all its awards!",1418688000,,1051,5.182352941176471

4550210,5,B0053O89YM,"The Good Wife, all 5 seasons that I have seen so far, is possibly the best courtroom drama series I have seen, ""Law and Order"" included.  There are many believable twists and turns; a wide variety of actors, many of whom we haven't seen in quite a while, and the story line is excellent. I admit that I binge-watched it like I did ""Breaking Bad.""  You just can't get away from it.  The chemistry - both negative and positive - between the actors makes you believe you are the proverbial ""fly on the wall"", watching things unfold on both sides of the aisle, and watching as the opposing law offices concoct their strategies for a wide variety of criminal and civil cases.  Start with Season 1; Episode 1, and watch as things unfold through the entire series.  Not many series on TV can touch it.",1418601600,,794,4.448275862068965

Not a great show like Breaking  Bad, Madmen, House of Cards, Walking Dead, etc., or even shows such as Damages, or Justified.  I realize that a lot of people think it is great, but I just don't see it.  I think it's good - but considerably over- rated.  But again, it is good - and very good for a network show. And of course it plays much better without commercials so it's a lot better on Amazon than network TV.",1417824000,,587,4.15929203539823

The same goes with her ex hubby. Alicia is by and far the best character on the show and is the best fleshed out as far as character development. The same also can be said for the character of Eli. If they dumped will and the ex and allowed the character of Alicia to expand beyond these two losers it would be a much better show. And Kalisa show get her own spin off show.

4550411,4,B0053O89YM,"I love the show. It is well-written, well-acted and not just a little bit addictive. My wife and I are binge-watching and consume at least three episodes each evening.

One of my favorite parts of the show is to see who will fill the roster of guest characters with each new episode. It's a treasure trove of cast members from shows like The Sopranos, ER, Law & Order, etc. It seems the longer the show runs, the better the list of guest stars gets.

However, I do tire of the Will/Alicia on-again, off-again romance story line. For a while it seemed they carried on the same conversation in every episode.

They find themselves in a compromising position (usually self-induced); there is some romantic gesture or overture (or at least palpable sexual tension) followed by one or the other (usually Will) saying, ""We need to talk.""

(You can literally watch episode two, miss ten episodes, and it will seem as if you missed nothing at all once you continue on episode twelve... waste of tv slot) I also like how this show is somewhat relatable to almost anyone that watches, not just lawyers and politicians.

4550839,5,B0053O89YM,"This is not your ""typical"" law show.  The Good Wife is an extremely well-written drama that involves complex characters whose real lives unfold around the business operations of a law firm.  Viewers are ushered into a world of litigation, arbitration, grand juries and the like, gaining a greater understanding of our judicial system, while also looking into the individual lives of the characters being played out....the moral and emotional challenges they face.

The acting is superb.  The regular cast is made up of seasoned actors and special appearances by the likes of Michael J. Fox and Rita Wilson, to name a few, are added bonuses.  Each episode stands alone in content, but has much greater depth when viewed as a total season.",1404172800,,737,5.008196721311475

I'm in Season 4 now.. and just the thought of not being able to watch more of this show is knocking me out... this show is compelling from the beginning of each episode until the end, the writing is impeccable, the cast is amazing and each character is a full blown major contender.... There must be a way to get Calista a show of her own.  If someone is not doing this they need to... but the writers must be the same for the best results.  I never get tired of Alicia - even when she is being her worst own enemy...and I adore Diane.  The clothes... did I talk about the clothes?  Holy gorgeousness!  Cary is perfect (His dad is a mess 'o bedbugs) Mr. Florrick (what can I say Chris Noth is terrific not just because he's nice to look at)  Story lines are meticulously drawn....

There is drama in the series but the subtle kind, where just a twitch in the facial muscle is enough to tell you what the character is going through. No need for loud noises, cries tears etc. Specially Alicia , she is the one who is wronged, is plagued by her own guilt to even retaliate. Yet she holds her own so beautifully. I love how she manages her professional life, her teenage kids and her mother in law. I could never be so firm and calm in the face of provocation like she is. And I just try to live her life on screen for just a little bit.",1403136000,,598,4.076271186440678

Even though I find the main character to be kind of a cold fish, she's the kind of cold fish I grew up with, so I can relate.  I also really enjoy the peripheral characters.  The story lines are engaging, and I enjoy how every episode brings a legal problem to it's conclusion, while other plots evolve throughout the season and seasons.
Also, the clothing worn by the women in this show is truly drool-worthy in it's super-corporate way.",1402876800,,495,4.53932584269663

Kalinda  is a great character and I can't wait to watch what she's up to in each show  I regret Michael J Fox's handicap but it interferes with my focus on the storyline.  It unbelievable that the blond lawyer ( I forget her name.) And her interfering baby would be tolerated in a ""real"" law firm.

I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HDX and saw all past seasons were available on my Prime Video so decided to take a chance. My first surprise was how drawn I became to the characters and the many concurrent plots and relationships.  Terrific acting by all and once I began watching the first season I was hooked.  Watched all currently available seasons almost non stop.  Just turned my TV off.  My next surprise was how much more I enjoyed watching on my Kindle Fire HDX than my recently purchased Samsung Smart LED TV.  The crispness of the picture on the Kindle Fire HDX I found to be almost like viewing professional photographs..it was so good.  When I purchased the Kindle I was conflicted about whether I would enjoy watching anything on such a small screen but the picture quality and the portability makes my Kindle the go to source for video now.

4550991,4,B0053O89YM,"I believe Season 1 and 2 were 5 star, this episode is slightly less impressive to me mainly because the lack of the friendship chemistry with Kalinda as well as the fact that it seems unrealistic that Peter and

I tried watching other episodes in the second season, but the episodes were just too 'pat' - sort of like the 70's TV weekly shows.

4551020,5,B0053O89YM,"My wife and I discovered ""The Good Wife"" via a random choice on Amazon Prime's TV show listing.  Not being regular television viewers my wife and I were totally unfamiliar with this program.  We found the good wife to have compelling characters, spiced by complicated, nuanced relationships.  Most intriguing are the legal cases  that the law firm winds their way through in each episode.  The show provides rich insight into the background research and investigation, legal maneuvering and Machiavellian rivalries that shape the eventual outcome of the cases.  Many of the cases involve current socio-political issues which are dealt with in a surprisingly even-handed way,  The show has very high production values which enhance my viewing enjoyment.",1399075200,,752,5.3760683760683765

When I found it on Amazon and started watching from the beginning it began to engage me.  It is the perfect thing to watch while on the treadmill -- entertaining, suspenseful, but not too taxing.  Most of the characters have some complexity.  The development of those characters, more than the depiction of solutions of each episode's legal case is what keeps the series moving and encourages me for the next day's treadmill torture.  I don't have experience with the legal profession, but if this is at all accurate, the amorality that underlies it is disturbing.",1396396800,,740,4.689922480620155

4551157,5,B0053O89YM,Such a good tv show to watch and get into especially if you like lawyer type TV shows. I would recommend the show to everyone,1394841600,,125,4.04
4551158,5,B0053O89YM,"First, I want to say that if your favorite kind of shows are shows about law offices, this probably deserves a 5-star review.  It just so happens that for me, the law holds limited appeal. But - the story lines are intriguing, the personal relationships are very complex, the characters are nuanced - not easy to figure out.  Each episode leaves me wanting more.  There is an element of suspense.  And the main character, Alicia Florrick (played brilliantly by Julianna Margulies) is maturing, growing and evolving over time (as are most of the principal characters.)  Maybe the most fascinating of all is Kalinda (Archie Panjabi, also amazing).  Kalinda plays it so close to the vest that when she shows her hand even a little, it is a revelation. And as an ensemble cast, they all work together beautifully.  Christine Baranski as Diane, the managing partner of the firm, brings so much wit and wry humor to her role.

Oh, what the heck, I just changed my mind.  Give it a 5!",1394841600,,977,4.666666666666667
4551159,5,B0053O89YM,"My wife and I have enjoyed this series very much.  We find it entertaining, with good and interesting programs weekly.  It is a refreshing improvement to a lot of the programs with very graphic scenes.",1394841600,,201,4.714285714285714
4551160,5,B0053O89YM,always interesting. My favorite bedtime watching.  The plots are often related to current events. And the characters seem like people I know,1394841600,,140,5.363636363636363
4551161,4,B0053O89YM,"Season 3 is very good.  There's less emphasis on the kids and homelife, but more attention given to Alisha and Peter's relationship.  There's a lot more Eli (which is good,) and Alisha and Kalinda have some conflict (which is ""mixed."")  Kalinda starts having some problems, and isn't as ""invulnerable"" as she's been in past seasons.

I'm continuing to watch, and am looking forward to seeing Season 4.",1394755200,,401,4.940298507462686
4551162,5,B0053O89YM,All of the characters are well-drawn and intriguing.  The plots and subplots seem true to life and well developed.  The human ambiguities in all the characters seem so realistic as well as their complex relationships.  Highly recommended.  I think it's important to start with Season 1 if you're a first time viewer--lots of history to enrich the viewing of other seasons.  I am just finishing Season 3 and can't wait to get started with Season 4.,1394755200,,447,4.828947368421052

4551165,5,B0053O89YM,"My husband and I caught up to where the Good wife is now through 3 seasons.  We were ""bereft"" when we came to the end!

4551166,5,B0053O89YM,"I had never watched this program as it ran on Sunday nights so was delighted to find it on amazon Prime.  It is well-written, fast-paced and riveting.  I am part way through season 3 (with 23 episodes to each season) so it will be a while before I catch up to the network but I love streaming it so I can watch when and where I can.  I think the BEST character is Kalinda, a very young, very talented enigma who is much older than her years.  I never now what's going to happen next!",1394668800,,483,4.052631578947368

4551169,5,B0053O89YM,The characters are realistic and likeable. The story lines make sense and I enjoy the occasional added twists. It's The only show I regularly watch and have learned a lot about law and lawyers - an interesting  field I've had no knowledge of. I have recommended this show to several and they share my views.

4551171,4,B0053O89YM,"I downgraded this season from five stars only because of the hanky panky between the good wife and her boss. I know that's supposed to be the conflict that everyone is interested in, but the writing is so good about the law cases that it becomes a distraction. And, I might add, if she were such a good wife, why would she be mixing it up with her boss who is obviously someone who will never make a commitment?

Dear writers, continue with the very interesting law cases, but drop the nonsense between her and Will. She is capable of carrying the show without it.",1394582400,,564,4.371428571428571

4551175,3,B0053O89YM,As with most products of Lefty-wood cant resist injecting politics into the littlest of things. At times it can have excellent court room drama and a nice mystery or two. Surprising good TV drama.,1394409600,,196,4.794117647058823
4551176,4,B0053O89YM,This series is great! I can't wait to own the entire set. Season 3 started off kinda slow but picked up towards the end. This season takes a closer look into some romantic relationships that are brewing.,1394409600,,203,4.513513513513513

4551189,5,B0053O89YM,"It's hard to watch just one episode. We are still intrigued by the intrigue! The characters are so well-drawn, and the Florricks' teenagers have really come into their own in this season. One of the things we love about Alicia's character is the way she takes time to think about her responses, especially in a tight or possibly embarrassing position. And Eli continues to amaze us by his depth. Also by his American accent since he is Scottish (Masterpiece Theater host).",1394064000,,472,4.839506172839506
4551190,5,B0053O89YM,"The title ""Good Wife"" turned me off, and I didn't watch this show for several years. However, I kept hearing how good the show is, so I started with Season One and am now in the middle of Season Three. To my surprise, this is one of the best dramas I've ever seen. The acting is superb, from the major characters to even the smallest of bit parts. The plots are engaging, funny, tragic, thought-provoking. Moral complexities are explored from several angles, and each episode leaves me thinking. I get caught up in this show and time just flies by; it is a great escape from my workaday life!",1394064000,,592,4.440366972477064

4551192,4,B0053O89YM,"I like this show quite a bit. The only thing stopping me from rating it with five stars is Will Gardner. I do not understand Alicia's attraction to Will Gardner. He is not handsome, not physically attractive and does not have an attractive personality. Every single time Alicia makes the slightest hint that she is attracted to him, I cringe. When they actually have been physical, I want to puke. He is disgusting. This show would get five stars from me if the role of Will had been cast with someone else. I just don't see anything attractive in this character at all.",1393977600,,570,4.543689320388349

A friend told us they didn't think Season 3 was quite as stellar, but I enjoyed the continuation of plot and influx of colorful characters, including Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston), Louis Canning (Michael J. Fox), Patti Nyholm (Martha Plimpton), among others. Always strong character performances from Diane (Christine Baranskii) and Alicia (Julianna Marquilies), and the sulky/smoldering/explosive Will Gardner (Josh Charles) and Kalinda (Archi Panjabi), along with myriad talent who play off each other so well.  I vote this the best drama on the network!",1393545600,,723,5.614678899082569

She became addicted as quickly as I had, so we have been watching all of the previous seasons together.  She loves it, and I'm enjoying each episode all over again.

The story lines revolving around legal issues were interesting.  As the seasons progressed, the episodes began showing sexual scenes that are totally unnecessary.  Very disappointing they felt it necessary to incorporate such perverseness in a series that was interesting without such scenes!",1393545600,2,408,5.34375

Enjoy!",1393545600,,312,4.9423076923076925
4551213,5,B0053O89YM,"The positive attributes of this series are the very convoluted plots and skilled actors. I give them A's for both. Believable roles played by actors with the talent to fit.  Excellent casting.  I can't emphasize enough.

There are several plots and subplots. What I like most is the satisfactory resolution of each story line in each episode;
compounded by back stories on each of the characters which is ongoing and continues to develop.
No character leads a perfect life. Although completely believable, are not like anyone I would know personally. Sometimes I am amused or disgusted by their foibles and other times, I sympathize. In short, there are plenty of twists and turns to contemplate, lots of complexity in the plots.

 I am a little curious about ""Will Gardner""....he looks tired, with dark circles around his eyes. Is this intended to show him in ill health? Is that makeup or are we experiencing foreshadowing?

 I'm not so sure I would ever vote for Mr. Frollic....he needs to be made more loveable, so far is is half Rat.

Eli Gold...love him...his body language fits the complexity of his role...his x-wife, however, doesn't fit. Great casting here.

Calinda...interesting role...not so sure her ""secrets"" are that important in this age.  The actress does a good job playing that part, however. Her wardrobe is completely unprofessional for a law office. But I suppose she does most of her work in the street.
She needs to have some changes of wardrobe to fit in with the variety of places she must go to investigate. An undercover agent would probably do that.

The good wife...her role, so far, hasn't been about being a wife, thank goodness. Running around in high heels all the time isn't to realistic...she needs to dress in tennis shoes then change to heels, much more believable in the big city.

Cary...so cute, he deserves more complexity, perhaps it will develop in his role over time.

Lockhart...powerful role, done really well. She may be headed for a nervous breakdown??

Who is my favorite character?  Calinda, I think. Always wondering what the firm will give her to investigate...much more important than her private life.
Maddy...another political Rat.
The Mothers-in-Law....well, can't you just strangle them. No advice here. Their roles so far just irritate and provide pause before the main plots.  Perhaps they ""need a lawyer"" now and then as their high jinks could be made amazing.

Although the characters look professional in clothing, etc. as indicative of a professional law firm, there is no overblown fluff about designer clothing, labels or false glamour. It's all about the plot(s).  Thank you, some aspects like costume design need to be in background....by the way, the costume designer is doing a great job.
Some nights I watch 2 or 3 episodes on Amazon Prime and am never bored.  Excellent guest performances provide relief from too much inbreeding.
Michael J. Fox is outstanding and I'm so pleased to see him back in his game. He has been missed on TV.
All in all....one of the best series on TV!  Please keep it free on Amazon Prime so I can continue to be a fan.",1393459200,,3118,4.891634980988593

Characters are believable although I wonder if I can stand to heard ""Do you have a minute?"" one more time (doesn't anybody work at that firm?)

4551261,5,B0053O89YM,"I love TV series that take the time for characters to develop week after week. Like the peeling of an onion, layers of intricacy unfold as the writers masterfully reveal characters' strengths and flaws, creating an almost hypnotic pull for the viewer to see the next episode. I find that the development of Zack and Grace has been remarkable. Storylines are well-thought out, compelling and, most importantly, believable. The actors are outstanding, using subtlety and nuance to convey what words alone sometimes cannot. This is must-see TV.",1392508800,,541,5.2298850574712645
4551262,4,B0053O89YM,"Oh, okay, maybe I should give the season 5 stars -- after all, I do still love ""The Good Wife."" However, there's a lot going on this season that I find annoying. First off, Millennials should be offended by how they're being portrayed on this show. It seems that all the new characters are 20- or 30-something, and they're all 1) preposterously gorgeous with perfect bodies; 2) glib, jaded, snarky and humorless (especially if they work for the State Attorney's Office).They also treat sex like something you do when you're bored. Where's the heart in these characters? And if Cary Agos doesn't wipe that squinting-eyed smirk off his face I'm going to slap him with a lawsuit for intentional inflection of emotional distress.

Also: Why is the whole world against Alicia Florrick? Currently:  Her ex mother-in-law is snooping through her apartment, trying to get the goods on her; her former colleague (via her ex-husband) is trying to find a way to bring down her entire law firm in general and her boss-boyfriend in particular; and a new, young, blonde associate (didn't she used to date Don Draper?) is leaving drool-spots all over Lockhart Gardner's expensive Berber carpets as she schemes to swipe Will away from Alicia before the next commercial break. Not only that, but Diane Lockhart is staring at her creepily through the glass walls because she suspects that Alicia and Will are violating the firm's sexual harassment policy. And oh yes, her best friend slept with her husband. And her kids are giving her the Third Degree about how she spends her time when they're at their dad's, as if she's not allowed to date. I'm starting to worry for Our Heroine. Can't the writers bring in Lisa Kudrow to play Alicia Florrick's therapist? I really think she needs one at this point.

Trying as all this is on my nervous system, there's still much gold to be mined this season: seeing big stars in small roles (not quite cameos, but almost) has always been part of TGW's fun, and so far we've had Harvey Fierstein, Parker Posey and Bob freaking Balaban! I'm waiting to tune in one day and see Richard Dreyfuss as a sitting judge. Wouldn't he be perfect in black robes?",1392508800,,2169,4.763297872340425
4551263,5,B0053O89YM,"I've been hooked since Season 1 after ignoring all my friend's pleas to watch it.

4551266,5,B0053O89YM,"Not just Season 3, rather Seasons 1 - 4:  Julianna Margulies delivers every episode with precision!!! Her character development is beautifully unraveling; and like James Spader, in Boston Legal, breathes a level of quality, sophistication, belief, and entertainment into her character which solicits a roller-coaster of emotions invoked by great episodic performances, subject matters, and predictable/unpredictable/ though-provoking resolutions.  In addition, The Good Wife has an absolutely amazing cast that performs equally as stellar.  Eagerly awaiting the air of Season 5.",1392422400,,578,6.2

She deals with things on a daily basis that would cripple many. She has her faults, but the writers are able to show her imperfections as, well, human imperfections.  Phenomenal actress, phenomenal writing.  REALLY.  I'm out of adjectives for this show...

Will has respected Alicia's choice of supporting her husband even though they live apart. Will has tried to put his feeling to the side. I love Kalinda. Another strong woman. She doesn't put up with any crap from anyone but still uses her God given gift. She is smart and cares about people. The writing on this show is fantastic.,1391299200,,454,4.617283950617284

The depth of character development, the skill at interesting segues into the past -- these are just a couple of things that create a kind of complex layering that is fascinating on many levels. It is no longer linear storytelling. I don't know if new writers came on board, or what. An example would be the story line in which Alicia has a chance to buy the house where she was a full time Mom before Peter's scandal came down. Her visit is poetry, and charged with images of objects in the house and yard that become powerful metaphors for her losses. (I won't give away these shots, but the one involving the bathroom wall is especially poignant.) I am hooked on a series that I only mildly enjoyed up till now.",1390867200,,775,4.426573426573427

Some of my favorite judges are Dennis O'Hare, Ana Gasteyer, Uncle Jr (for you Soprano fans), and Harvey Fierstein.  The writing is great and keeps you always thinking one way, and the plot shifts the other.

As for Julianna Margulies, she has a pair.  Her character grows from a meek and tormented SAHM (Stay at Home Mom) to a wonderfully intelligent lawyer who knows exactly where she wants her new life to take her.  Challenges come and go, but she is powerful enough to stay true to her beliefs and family values.  Kudos to the writers because sometimes women forget the family part when power comes so easily.",1390867200,,718,4.650793650793651

4551414,4,B0053O89YM,"Love this show. They perhaps overdo it with Julianna Margulies' character being constantly 'right' and flawless, but the overall cast is brilliant, the writing a nice balance between long story arcs and episode-level procedurals.

Archie Panjabi deserves the praise she gets. A unique balance of humor, mystery, sexiness and solid acting. Chris Noth is exactly Chris Noth, Alan Cummings nails it repeatedly, though there is a disconnect between his being a high-powered, feared political operative and an absolute pushover in every scene.

Christine Baranski wasn't a favorite of mine in the past but shows the most depth and nuance of any of the cast.

Overall great, and season 3 is better than season 2.",1390348800,,706,5.175438596491228

Although its considered a drama there are many episodes that it's less about the characters and more about the cases. Season 3 is no exception. Somehow the writers are still finding new types of cases and keeping things interesting. It is refreshing that after two seasons it's still as good as day 1.",1389484800,,450,4.244186046511628

This affair becomes the norm in season 3 as the series seems to explore the question, ""What does it mean to be a good wife or husband?""  In this case, it is Alicia who has lowered herself to the self-indulgent behaviors for which her husband was scandalously famous.  The tension in this show for me is the fact that the title raises expectations that marital relationships could be guided by virtues, while the characters ongoing, non-virtuous choices are depicted sympathetically.",1389484800,,575,4.907216494845361
4551478,5,B0053O89YM,"Really enjoyable show. Start at the beginning and watch the threads over the seasons. This season's exploration of ""what does friendship mean"" is thought provoking.",1389484800,,164,5.6

4551484,5,B0053O89YM,"As a guy, I can tell that this series is oriented toward women.  It is currently in its 5th season and is ongoing.  Back a few weeks ago, I was idly searching around for a series pilot to look at to see if I wanted to watch a few more episodes of the program.  I watched the pilot episode of this show and I was hooked.  I binged on this thing all the way up to the current episode and am now waiting week by week for the next episode.

This show constantly has several plot strings going on side-by-side, lots of internal law firm intrigue, occasional physical violence and some truly great guest appearances by well known actors.  Since I watched it all in binge mode, i was able to also pick up the foreshadowing tidbits in early episodes which were then exploited in later episodes or seasons.  Also, I enjoyed watching Julianna Margulies' two kids (actors) grow into full teenagers over the course of the 5 years, too.  I noticed that Ridley Scott was involved in writing the episodes, so that pretty much sealed the deal for me.

Every season of the 5 seasons (so far) have been terrific.  I can't recommend it enough, and they all rate 5 stars as far as I am concerned.",1389398400,,1176,4.353211009174312

4551493,3,B0053O89YM,Writers using current events and more sexually voyeuristic material to spice up the show. Down we go into paperback novel territory in place of more edifying professional legal issues and personal relationships.,1389225600,,211,5.625

4551495,5,B0053O89YM,"I love it. The interaction between Kalinda  and Alicia is tense but still not as enemies. The back-story with the ex-girlfriend and Will adds a new dimention to the currents running just below the surface.

I liked the show at one time but the more I watch it the less I like it. It's mean and to say that whites can't pick out the differences in other races because of their ethnicity is completely fraudulent. CBS has used this show as a political ploy to get low information voters to vote on the left. If anyone thinks the political climate in Chicago is anything less and corrupt they are just blind. The real reality is that Chicago is rife with corruption and is not as flowery and sweet as this show would have anyone to believe. Its just gotten out of hand and I'm sorry it sickens me. No wonder I stopped watching CBS a long time ago.  Seriously, the Tea Party is not a bunch of radicals. They are people who want their freedom that the constitution affords them.

4551565,4,B0053O89YM,"I would give it a five stars but I like to be tight with judgment, I always hope to find something better or improving.
Besides the court portion sometimes is too repetitive and the typically one episode timeframe makes it very 'American' but less real.

I think this is an extremely well written tv series with interesting characters.",1388275200,,335,4.775862068965517

4551580,5,B0053O89YM,Little is black and white in this show and the characters are all very human.  Sometimes i even think about what is happening to them when i am not watching the show.  One starts to care for them.  My wife who is not a big TV watcher is hooked and often refers to characters in our every day conversation.  The family situations are also most fraught and realistic.,1387324800,,365,4.323529411764706

Juliana Marguiles (sp?) gives an incredible performance as a woman piecing her life back together after a major betrayal by her husband of fifteen years and the ensuing public scandal.  Supporting roles are equally well-acted..  The office intrigue is realistic, as is the general insanity of the law as a profession.",1384214400,,474,4.7317073170731705

4551638,4,B0053O89YM,The Good Wife is a terrific series that continues to hold my attention.  It defies the standard formulaic progression many of the dramatic series fall prey to; focusing too long on one particular relationship or rehashing the same story lines.  Just when you think you can guarantee what is about to happen the story turns left.,1383523200,,328,4.839285714285714

I find with most TV drama i can consistently predict what is going to happen next, but that is not the case with this show, and I like that it is that way.

If one enjoys sitcoms, and action drama this may not be your cup of tea.  If you prefer drama that cause you to think, then this may be for for you.

Let me reiterate that we all have personal taste.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying sitcom an/or action drama.  For example my wife does and I personally think she is a terrific human being!",1382140800,,637,4.180327868852459

They also get the closest to any show of what a lawyer's firm experience is. This show has given me a great many de ja vu moments with respect to my own career as an attorney.  The quality of the acting is also beyond reproach.,1381708800,,395,4.458333333333333

4551697,5,B0053O89YM,"It is a trully entertaining as well as stimulating viewers' thinking production.  The characters are endearing, presenting a wide spectrum of human variety, intelligent, passionate in their personal goals and values.  The interactions beautifully reflect the complexity of relationships where personal and social interests clash and intertwine.  The series stands out, in addition to other aspects, with relatively little violence, while keeping viewers in suspense.  It is not an easy challenge in the market where suspense and excitement is usually created mostly by the use of physical violence  and criminal activities.  While The Good Wife plots obviously include criminal behaviors and thinking patterns, the lines are often subtle and blurred, demonstrating complexity of human reality.
While generally not a fan of popular TV series and drama, The Good Wife is among my favorites.  I find myself returning to episodes from all 4 seasons, welcoming the characters as old friends I miss.

For better or worse the premise of this show continues to remain a current topic of conversation. Its interesting to see these political marraiges after the hoopla dies down.

4551706,3,B0053O89YM,"Something's been gnawing at me about this show and I just put my finger on it....well educated women in their early 40s--in the time-period in which this show takes place--don't think or act as this main character does.  Even the title is ridiculous!
I've enjoyed most of the performances, and think the court cases we've seen have been exceptional, but the relationships are just sooooooooo far fetched!  Alicia referring to Kalinda as a best friend is ludicrous! Neither character (as written) has shown much interest in getting to know one another beyond case-work or the occasional barroom ""shot."" In regards to the parent/child relationships, Alicia is clueless re: her teenage kids and disregards their emotional well-being, barely answering their questions/concerns about much of anything: again, that kind of hands-off parenting went out of vogue an entire generation ago.
I haven't decided if I will keep watching this series or not.  Indeed, I've only stuck with it because it's free with my prime membership.  If I had to pay extra I'd have ""turned the channel"" on The Good Wife a long time ago!",1381017600,3,1106,5.06043956043956

This series has so far resisted the fate of many series in their third year or later - they often turn into soap operas as the writers become desperate for ideas.  The weakness - Julianna Margulies is the least-talented member of the cast, and the episodes are enjoyable despite, rather than because of her.  Christine Baransky is the brightest light in a stellar cast.",1379635200,,452,5.164383561643835

I love that the show presumes you are smart enough to follow the narrative and doesn't spoon feed you along the way. I feel like I'm being treated like an intelligent adult. The court cases continue to be culturally and politically relevant. The personal dramas ebb and flow and just when you think maybe it's getting a bit too melodramatic, they move on.

4551829,4,B0053O89YM,"Okay this is better. I enjoy courtroom drama movies and TV shows. Season one of The Good Wife was good enough that I suggested my wife and I might watch it together. She usually likes murder mysteries. But season two changed my mind and I suggested to my wife that the program had taken a negative turn and I'd continue to watch it on my own.

What I saw in season two was way too much back stabbing, shifty dialog, and untrustworthy people. All believable but not what I want to watch. The legal firm also was fixated on it's monetary problems, laying people off, and accepting new members into the firm solely for the money they could bring in regardless of their ethics. Season three is a refreshing departure.

Season three seems to have much smarter writing. A big step back in all of the office politics, and more focus on cases. I'm only 1/2 way through the season but enjoying it very much.",1376524800,,898,4.4363636363636365

Maybe it is because of the commercials on regular TV but one thing for sure I went through all 3 seasons (22 episodes each) in under 3 weeks. Now I need to try and watch Season 4 before Season 5 starts in September. This show is FANTASTIC. It just mesmerizes you. As soon as 1 episode is over you almost have to start watching the next episode. Just when you think that the 2nd or 3rd episode is dealing with new story lines the 4th episode brings back stories from the first and second episodes.

I swear the writers just sit around a table with little representations of each character and mix them up, then write about their association. Then they re-shuffle and write some more. It's such a great interaction with all the recurring characters. LOVE it!",1373673600,,335,4.793103448275862

Homeland is good, but not as consistently good as The Good Wife, which is very often brilliant.. Homeland is controversial, more nudity, so I guess that is awards are about.  Julianna is far superior to Clair Danes, in my opinion, it is so easy to play crazy!  To play normal is a challenge.

The cast does an excellent job, sometimes, I love them, then I'm mad at them, sometimes I loathe them, then somehow I love them again.  They never cease to amaze me with their storylines, and how they interweave characters from previous seasons.  Love it.",1373068800,,692,4.516129032258065

At first when it was advertised on national TV it did seemed like another law drama. It looked like one of may episodic TV shows that I wouldn't be interested in. The series is like crack, I couldn't stop. I think I lost a few weekends of my life to the Good Wife. Not to be missed.

4551990,5,B0053O89YM,"Best soap opera ever. Excellent writing, amazing casting, the actors are all very good, and the question foremost in my mind? What will Christine Baranaski be wearing in the next episode? That woman can dress! Alicia? not so much, but then she's not at the top of the food chain either. I like the women in the series, how they interact in the workplace. Personally, I've never seen women interact like men, but I'm all for it.  If Julianna Marguiles is the new Mary Tyler Moore, we have much to be thankful for. How does she do it?

I cut the cable, got rid of my TV about 14 years ago because I was so frustrated with the lack of quality entertainment: seemed to me the better the picture got, the worse the content was. While watching The Good Wife has made me run out to buy a flat screen TV, I'm impressed. Half a dozen shows like this one and maybe I will.

I know that cases don't settle nearly as quickly as portrayed in this show, people don't hunt you down at private affairs to review evidence, and everybody isn't brilliant.  Even still, the cast does a phenomenal job with the script they've been given.  It astounds me how many of the women on this show wear 5 inch heels on a daily basis.  Their poor feet.

Some series diminish in creativity for story lines....this just stays consistently great season after season, episode after episode.  There is not one episode where we said, 'That wasn't very good.'  Not one.  There's even places where the dialogue was so simply profound that I had to play that part over for others to hear.

When amazon announced the availability of the third season on prime I was glad.  The reason why I think this show works so well is that they try to incorporate current events in thier episodes.

I don't think that trying to impose social views should be part of entertainment.  Some of the actors/actresses on the program are good and you either like them or dislike them.  I am learning a great deal about lawyers and Chicago.  It is certainly not a positive experience.  I really don't know if the program was designed to give viewers this negative view.  It's a good thing that older programs, such as Perry Mason or Murder She Wrote are still available for viewing.  You can watch about 50 minutes of these programs and actually enjoy them.  As for lawyers and ""the Chicago way"", I've learned a lot about how lawyers operate and the real wheeling and dealing of Chicago politics.  I always knew politics was a dirty business but never realized just how dirty.  I have now changed my opinion of what may be the lowest professions.  The mainstream media is now at the bottom, followed by politicians, then lawyers, and used car salesmen.  Used car salesmen is no longer at the bottom, in my opinion (as one of the judges on The Good Wife requires lawyers to say).",1369008000,,1171,4.55023923444976

4552093,5,B0053O89YM,"I was close to not buying Season 3 because of some of the reviews on Amazon, but I am glad I did because it seemed like the cases and circumstances behind them got better and better. In the past seasons there would be excerpts of cases but you never knew the background of them, it was a simple Guilty or Not Guilty. With each new episode in Season 3 the show never veered from what makes it great which are lawyers doing what they do best.
I really didn't like how Will and Alicia had to keep their relationship a secret and eventually someone found out but it died because of her s****** daughter and her actions and it never fully ran its course and that's why in the next season she still has feelings and erotic dreams about Will even when he's with someone else; Other than that Great Show!!!",1368489600,,798,4.291390728476821

4552184,3,B0053O89YM,"I watched this via Amazon because I missed the broadcast.

What else can I say?

The series itself is 5 stars as far as I am concerned. I took two stars off because Amazon does not bother to provide closed captioning, and that takes much of the fun out of the experience as far as I am concerned.

I typically watch with closed captioning on, for a number of reasons (hard of hearing, English is not my first language). Netflix and Hulu can do it and they don't even charge per show. So I won't be streaming much from Amazon until they figure out closed captioning.",1360454400,,565,4.311320754716981

4552200,4,B0053O89YM,"I own all 3 seasons of THE GOOD WIFE on DVD.  I'm a big fan of courtroom drama, be it in books or movies; and there is some Long-Range, exceptionally fine courtroom strategy in season 3.  State-of-the-art long-range courtroom strategy.  Why the 4-star review?  Because I am pissed that starting in season 2 THE GOOD WIFE added a digital blur to the DVD discs on top of the optical blur that the series is shot in to obscure the age of the stars.  I am irritated that the studio deliberately ships inferior video for the DVD format on seasons two and three.  If season one is sharp, why can't they do that next year, and the year after for season two and three???  When the picture quality of season one of a show on DVD is better than season two and three on DVD, you know something is wrong.  @hg47",1357344000,,799,4.28

4552204,5,B0053O89YM,"I've enjoyed watching the Good Wife- the characters are interesting, the story line captures your attention, the pace is great, and there are many depths to consider- courtroom, corporate intrigue, loyalties, trust, betrayal, prejudice, honor... some of the performances are very believable (Alicia) while others less so, but overall, this is like a great vacation novel, in many chapters.

In addition, the streaming has been nearly flawless.",1357084800,,443,5.611940298507463

The British former consultant to ..... Has been written poorly this time, I thought. First, how did he get to have such a large part in the law firm, so large he is contemplating a take-over? Very little he does is realistic; especially sex. There is no chemistry between him and the very unattractive woman who hovers about him, and professes her lust. Then he reciprocates, but it is totally unbelievable, and his going to bed with her seems just icky. Most of what this actor, who is a very good actor, does in this season seems weakly written and brings the show down.

The writers, in the comments, seem in love with their guest women; they laugh. I found them, the ex-wife of the Brit (Parker Posey? I should have refamiliarized myself with everyone's name since I have anomia) and the comedian Sedaris seem to have been inserted in a kind of blinders-on way, the way you might try to palm off stoned, hilarious 'creativity' even after the high wears off. I felt used, that someone's laziness wasted my time during all those too-long bits.

The actor who plays Kalinda, like all the actors, is very good. But her fluctuating British posh-not-posh accent is distracting. Sometimes I think some Brits have a very low opinion of Americans' view of British accents -- that they're all the same. But we've seen enough regional British movies that we can almost place some characters' accents within Britain and between classes. Kalinda's fluctuating one is distracting in itself but especially when she effects a more upper-class accent. Then, all I can think of is, 'she's doing that again'. It's perplexing, why this goes on.",1348790400,,1883,4.752293577981652

As Season 3 opens, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) has emerged with greatly increased confidence in herself, both as a woman and as an attorney at Lockhart/Gardner, after the intense personal and professional struggles she endured during Season 2. She has left her husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) after finding out he had a one-night stand years ago with Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjaba), the firm's mysterious private investigator. In spite of the fact that Kalinda did not know Alicia then, this explosive revelation makes it impossible for Alicia to be anywhere near Kalinda without feeling an overwhelming urge to scream at her friend or burst into tears--which is a real problem since they have to work together on cases at Lockhart/Gardner.

Kalinda, who normally is a really tough nut, is shown at the end of Season 2 visibly heartbroken over losing her friendship with Alicia, which was clearly one of the closest relationships she'd ever had. On the heels of what Alicia sees as a double betrayal, she has kicked Peter out of their apartment and dumped him and his possessions into an apartment she obtained for him without his prior knowledge. As apparent retaliation, Peter, who has just been re-elected to his old office as State's Attorney, strictly because of Alicia's high-profile loyalty and support during his campaign, has hired Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) to be his second-in-command. Cary has been Alicia's enemy since Season 1 when she beat him out for an associate position at Lockhart/Gardner.

Alicia has begun talks with Lockhart/Gardner's barracuda divorce attorney, David Lee (the immensely talented Zach Grenier), and launched a torrid affair with Will Gardner (Josh Charles). For multiple reasons, Alicia and Will opt to keep their affair top secret: he is her boss, she is still legally married to Peter, and she doesn't want her kids to know about the affair.

This show does a fantastic job this entire season, as it did the previous two seasons, delivering interesting cases for Lockhart/Gardner to represent. The series's excellent writers (led by award-winning, writer/producer, husband-and-wife team, Michelle and Robert King) keep these cases enthralling to viewers by offering spicy--and sometimes humorous--conflicts for the lawyers, such as client chicanery to be worked around, in-house rivalries threatening to torpedo the success of a given case, or mysteries for the ruthlessly capable Kalinda to solve in order to prove a client's innocence or win a case. In addition, whatever the overarching legal plot, it always deftly intertwines with several personal-relationship subplots every week. All of the main characters are linked to each other and numerous other subcharacters in an ever expanding web of secrets, lies and conniving. This could easily become confusing rather than pleasantly intriguing in less skillful hands than those of the show's writing team, but they never drop any plot threads, and never allow the show to slide into outright soapiness, a failing that seems to afflict the vast majority of nighttime drama.

The acting continues to be terrific. I concur 100% with the Emmy wins of Julianna Margulies for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Archie Panjabi for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and the nominations of Josh Charles as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and Christine Baranski, as Diane Lockhart, for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

Though Matt Czuchry has not yet been nominated for an Emmy for this show, he contributes greatly to its success by his capable handling of his recurring role as ambitious attorney, Cary Agos. I quite enjoyed the growth arc of his relationship with Alicia this season. Czuchry's outstanding ability to portray Cary's intense emotions through subtle facial expressions--in keeping with the poker face that men in general employ, and lawyers especially are forced to cultivate--never fails to entertain.

Mary Beth Peil as Jackie Florrick continues her excellent work as the ambitious mother of Alicia's husband, Peter, and Peter also gets a lot of stage time this season as he contemplates a run for the governor's office. This goal is made all the more fascinating because it is impossible to achieve without the cooperation of both Alicia and cagey political operative, Eli Gold.

Eli is one of my favorites on a show overflowing with talented actors playing plum parts. Alan Cumming's portrayal of Eli is filled with delightful contradiction. Just when Eli's ruthlessness is about to push him over the edge into the territory of unsympathetic, irredeemable jerk, out peeks a soft-heartedness that is often quite funny to behold. After Season 1, Cumming received an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Apparently because his work was so exceptional that year, he was promoted to a recurring role, and for Season 2, he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor.

I could go on and on about the caliber of the many actors with recurring guest roles, but two in particular deserve special attention: Michael J. Fox received his 12th Emmy nomination for his portrayal of attorney Louis Canning, who cynically attempts to gin up sympathy from judges and juries for his Parkinson-type symptoms in order to win his cases. Martha Plimpton (Emmy winner as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raising-Hope/dp/B003UD7JDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raising Hope</a>) plays cutthroat attorney Patti Nyholm who, like Louis Canning, uses a physical health condition--in her case pregnancy and later the baby that resulted from that pregnancy--to deceive and manipulate her opponents.

If you haven't been watching this show every week, or even if you have, this DVD is a worthwhile investment in some of the best TV drama of this season or any other.",1336348800,44,6354,5.581950207468879
4552267,5,B0053O89YM,"Cool! I get to live out the dream of being the first to review a popular product AND give a rave to the third season of one of my favorite shows on TV. I have to say: I have given a pass to nearly every network series of the past ten years, preferring the more complex and adult dramas and comedies found on cable-TV. But THE GOOD WIFE fulfills all of my requirements for great entertainment: gripping plotlines, complex characters and brilliant acting, writing and directing. Julianna Margulies anchors the show beautifully as Alicia Florrick, and Season 3 gives her great new material to play, particularly at the start of the season with her boss, Will Gardner (Josh Charles). How their affair plays out - and draws in her ex-husband Peter (Chris Noth) and her OTHER boss, Diane Lockhart (the always amazing Christine Baranski) makes for great drama that never descends to soapiness. Alan Cumming expands his role as Eli Gold, now practicing law in Alicia's office even as he juggles his career as a political consultant, and he provides many of the comic highlights throughout the season. Matt Czuchry deepens his portrayal of Cary Agos, having switched sides from defense to the D.A.'s office. And of course, there's my (and probably most other viewers') favorite character, Kalinda Sharma (Archie Punjabi) whose friendship with Alicia went up in smoke at the end of Season Two. The fallout of this event, as well as the other troubles she encounters, make Kalinda appear more vulnerable than ever before. By season's end, several intriguing questions about her character are answered, even as new mysteries surrounding her past begin. Chris Noth and Mary Beth Peil round out the exceptional cast of characters, with Jackie's antagonism Alicia providing some stellar moments. Great talent, great court cases, great season ending cliffhanger. I, for one, am eagerly looking forward to Season Four. For those of you who have NEVER watched this show before, BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING!

Amazon since cross-posted this review under the reviews for the whole season, so it appears as if I wrote two reviews for Season 3, which I actually did not. On to the review for Episode 1:

This show remains consistently high quality! Season 3 gets off to an exciting start with this initial episode titled, ""A New Day.""

Coming off of all the struggles of Season 2, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) has emerged as much more confident in herself both as a woman and as an attorney at Lockhart/Gardner.

In her personal life, Alicia has left her husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) after finding out he had a one-night stand years ago with Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjaba), the firm's private investigator. In spite of the fact that Kalinda did not know Alicia then, this explosive revelation makes it impossible for Alicia to be anywhere near Kalinda without feeling an overwhelming urge to scream at her friend or burst into tears--which is a real problem since they have to work together on cases at Lockhart/Gardner.

Kalinda, who normally is a really tough nut, is shown at the end of Season 2 visibly heartbroken over losing her friendship with Alicia, which was one of the closest she'd ever had. On the heels of what Alicia sees as a double betrayal, she has kicked Peter out of their apartment and dumped him and his possessions into an apartment she got for him. As apparent retaliation, Peter, who just got re-elected to his old office as State's Attorney, strictly because of Alicia's high-profile loyalty and support during his campaign, at the end of Season 2 hires Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) to be his second-in-command. Cary has been Alicia's enemy since Season 1 when she beat him out for an associate position at Lockhart/Gardner.

Alicia has begun talks with Lockhart/Gardner's barracuda divorce attorney, David Lee (the immensely talented Zach Grenier), and launched a torrid affair with Will Gardner (Josh Charles). For multiple reasons, Alicia and Will opt to keep their affair top secret: he is her boss, she is still legally married to Peter, and she doesn't want her kids to know about the affair.

On a professional front in this episode, Alicia takes the lead when the firm opts to defend a Muslim college student accused of assaulting a Jewish student during a campus brawl. Initially the case seems like a slam dunk for Alicia because no physical evidence exists to link their client to the crime, and Kalinda discovers a photo that offers an alibi for their client. Alicia is also convinced that the State's Attorney's office's hate-crime charge against her client is simply Peter showboating for the news media during his first week back in office. Then Cary and his prosecution team reveal their true plan--the same evidence that exonerates Alicia's client from the assault may implicate him as the primary suspect in a murder investigation.

This show does a great job every week (both for this first episode and all the other episodes of this season and the previous two seasons) of offering interesting cases for Lockhart/Gardner to represent. The writers keep these cases enthralling to viewers by offering spicy--and sometimes humorous--conflicts for the lawyers such as client chicanery to be worked around, in-house rivalries threatening to torpedo the success of a given case, or mysteries for the ruthlessly capable Kalinda to solve in order to prove a client's innocence or win a case. In addition, whatever the overarching legal plot, it always deftly intertwines with the many personal-relationship subplots occurring every week. Each of the characters is linked to multiple other characters in an ever spreading web of secrets, lies and conniving, but the show's highly talented writers (Michelle and Robert King) never drop any threads or cross the line into outright soapiness, which so much of nighttime drama seems to inevitably end up doing.",1332201600,8,4036,4.997023809523809

I would be very surprised if anyone wants it to go in that direction now.

8455502,5,B0053O89YM,"""The Good Wife"" is a masterful CBS legal and family drama. Season 3 continues its depiction of the travails and tribulations of a middle-age woman whose entire life was upended by the scandalous and criminal behavior of her husband, which had landed him in prison, and unable to care for his family. She is a law school graduate who has not practiced law for many years, after having given up her career to raise her children and manage the household. She re-entered the workforce as a junior associate at a prestigious law firm, and one of the name partners of her new firm is a former law school classmate, who had once been a very close friend. In this third season, the lead character has now become a premier litigator for her law firm, and regularly takes on the most challenging and high-profile cases. ""The Good Wife"" is an interesting and compelling television program, which is characterized by superb writing, intelligent and thought-provoking story lines, and excellent plot and character development. The acting is first-rate, with stellar performances by the ensemble cast, which includes Julianna Margulies, Chris Noth, Christine Baranski, Josh Charles, Matt Czuchry, Zach Grenier, Archie Panjabi, Alan Cumming, Michael J. Fox, Makenzie Vega, and Graham Phillips, to name a few. I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""The Good Wife,"" and I found it to be decidedly engaging and entertaining. ""The Good Wife"" is an outstanding television series, which truly merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1494979200,5,1533,5.185483870967742
