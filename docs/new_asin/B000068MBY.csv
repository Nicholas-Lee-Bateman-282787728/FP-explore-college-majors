1725349,4,B000068MBY,"Before Christopher Columbus directed the Home Alone movies, Mrs. Doubtfire and the first 2 Harry Potter movies, he directed this film named Heartbreak Hotel. Tuesday Weld which I am sure that you may already know of, that co-started with the real life Elvis Presley, co-stars in this movie, and this time she is a diehard Elvis Presley fan. The year is 1972, and of course if the story is supposed to have Elvis Presley in it, it would have to take place during his lifetime. Now maybe it didn't win over the critics, but at least Elvis fans should be able to love and enjoy this film. But instead, it is David Keith that is taking on this role, and he is in and out so quickly, that you might even forget that he is in the movie. He is seen very breifly in the beginning of the movie, and then the story shifts over to a small town in Ohio. Johnny Wolfe (Charlie Schlatter) is a roll and roller that dreams of winning a school talent show, but every year he gets cut, and this year he believes it going to be differenmt, but once again, he and his bandmits goes to an aduition, and once again the souts cuts them, which he believes they don't like Rock and Roll. He lives with his Mom Marie Wolfe (Tuesday Weld) and kid sister Pam Wolfe (Angela Goethals), who believes that somebody is out to get her, if the lights are out when she is sleeping, and so she likes to sleep with the lights on. And he doesn't like his Mom's boyfriend, and when she is injured in a car crash, while on a short drive, and is in the hopsital. Johnny is waken up by a cop that came to his house to deliver the news, along with news that the door was left open. So he goes to visit her in the hospital, and then has a brainstrom of how he can cheer her up. And when he learns that Elvis Presley (David Keith) is coming to Cleveland to play a concert. So he and his badnmates makes a plan to go to the show and kidnap him, so he can bring him home to his mother. But Johnny has another problem, how to even get close to Elvis, and he remembers that Elvis was very close to his own mother Gladys Presley, until her death, and they know of a cook (Jacque Lynn Colton) that looks like her, so now he has to get her to agree to go to the show with them, looking exactly like Elvis' late Mother, and of course you should know how Elvis would react to this. And they take off for Cleveland, to attend the show, and to lure Elvis Presley away from his bandmates, and secuirty. And the plans works, but of course Elvis doesn't like this idea at first. Now I don't know that the scene in this movie, that they totally remake a scene from Loving You, which involves Elvis Presley himself is really that needed.",1138492800,2,2676,4.167953667953668

1725352,5,B000068MBY,"When I'm not in a particularly pleasant mood, there are five movies that I watch as sort of ""mood elavation.""  When I yearn for ""days bygone,"" I sigh wistfully, think ""been there-done that"" and watch Cheech & Chong's ""Up In Smoke.""  When my wife is in a rare cozy mood, we watch Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve in ""Somewhere In Time.""  When I am angry enough to, say, send Usama Ben Dover a map of...somebody's hometown with the caption, ""Yo Mama Eat Poke,"" I will gleefully watch Chevy Chase's ""Modern Problems.""  And when I'm of a most irresponsible frame of mind, I will almost wet my pants laughing at Nicholas Cage in ""Raising Arizona.""  But as an ex-musician, a Southern ex-musician, one who sadly acknowledges the grim fact that Rock and Roll did indeed DIE on August 16, 1977, ""Heartbreak Hotel"" defnitely tops them all.  The plot is almost non-existent - indeed, it ADMITS in the opening credits that ""there are many stories about the King...this is a fable.""  The...""fable,"" you ask?  It's 1972, Johnny Wolfe's Mom, as portrayed by the GORGEOUS Tuesday Weld, runs (and evidentally owns) a decaying motel, and she seems to be suffering from depression.  She even has a jerk of a drunken, abusive boyfriend to make things ""dramatic"" or something.  So Johnny, in between school, babbling about Alice Cooper, playing with his band (""The Wolfe Pack""), and raising his little sister Pammy, comes to the conclusion that kidnapping >Elvis Presley!< will cheer up his Mom.  See? I TOLD you! CHEESE! NO plot!  Still, watching Johnny ""kidnap Elvis"" and transform him into ""the '56 Elvis"" (""that's when Mom said you were the coolest""), and then, the sight of David Keith as Elvis, singing ""Love Me"" as Mrs. Wolfe comes home from a date - this is Rock and Roll CHEESE at its absolute FINEST, folks.  And Heaven knows, given the current state of the mung that calls itself ""rock and roll"" right now, we could ALL use a few cheeseburgers (""cheeseburgers,"" by the way, are featured quite prominantly in the movie). No use in recounting any more of the plot - except that the next-to-final-scene, where ""Elvis"" and the ""Wolfe Pack"" hijack Johnny's high school's talent show and perform the song ""Heartbreak Hotel"" gives me the EXACT SAME THRILL as ANYTHING in the movie ""Woodstock"" (""Gimme Shelter"" - now that's ANOTHER story altogether...we'll discuss IT later...).  No, ""Heartbreak Hotel"" will never win any awards for anything (and thank The Lord for THAT), but if you want a GUARANTEED grin...check it out, y'all:  excellent, EXCELLENT cheese!",1087689600,6,2543,4.895104895104895
1725353,4,B000068MBY,"It's 1972 and Johnny Wolfe(Charlie Schlatter) and his band prepare for a performance for a talent show at their high school. His mom Marie(Tuesday Weld) is a die-hard Elvis Presley fan. So to ""make her happy"",Johnny and his buddies ""kidnap"" Elvis(David Keith) after a concert via an anesthetic,and drive him to the Wolfes' home. It was there when Elvis awoke. Johnny wanted Elvis to stay so his mom can meet him(Elvis). Elvis subtracts 16 years off his life. He shaved off his big heavy sideburns and wore an outfit that he regularly wore in 1956. Johnny told Elvis,""My mom says you looked the coolest in '56!) Marie had returned home from the hospital after being severely beaten up by her drunk and physically abusive boyfriend(Chris Mulkey). She finds ""young"" Elvis at the top of the Wolfes' staircase,playing guitar and singing one of Marie's favorites,""Love Me"". A shocked Marie changes into a beautiful dress and invites Elvis to stay for dinner. Johnny's little sister(Angela Goethals) is so afraid to sleep in the dark until Elvis convinces her that doing that is not scary. Elvis even redecorates the Wolfes' home and in the process,discards Johnny's rock band posters. At the talent show,Elvis appears with Johnny and his band backing him up. Then Elvis' band of bodyguards fly to Elvis' whereabouts so he can go on with his touring elsewhere. Elvis was like a husband to divorced Marie and a father to Johnny and his sister. At one point in the film,Johnny beats up Steve,Marie's boyfriend,revengefully(""You stay away from my mother!"") At another point,while returning from a grocery store,Johnny is later beaten up by Steve and a couple of Steve's buddies in front of a bar where Steve and his buddies were shooting pool. I dedicate this film to the memory of Elvis Aaron Presley(January 8,1935-August 16,1977). HEARTBREAK HOTEL is strictly fictitious and is no way based on actual events that occurred during the real Elvis' life. The film was directed by Chris Columbus,who also wrote the story and screenplay. Columbus also directed ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING,a year before this film.",1067558400,7,2098,5.0489913544668585
1725354,5,B000068MBY,"I love this movie. Its a great feel good movie. And while other reviewers here have stated that Kieth sung ALL the music in this movie... is simply NOT TRUE. He did sing some in it... like the scene where he is coming down the steps. BUT... if anyone thinks he sounds like ELvis then they haven't listned to Elvis that much. If anyone thinks he sounds better than any impersonator... I would ask for you to listen to a man by the name of Doug Church.
I have been an Elvis fan for a VERY VERY VERY long time. Kieth doesnt look anything like Elvis... however, as one reviewer stated, he DOES capture that essence superbly. He does a great job in this movie all things considered.
This movie can be enjoyed by Elvis fans and non Elvis fans alike. ITs a good, humorous story with a feel good ending. It does Elvis justice and leaves you wishing that this had happened.",1056758400,2,864,4.306748466257669

You can't miss with this one, especially if you are an Elvis fan.",1022284800,4,346,4.733333333333333
1725356,5,B000068MBY,"'Heartbreak Hotel' is one one the all-time greatest entertainment treasures. With a solid, brilliant cast led by the incredibly talented  Mr. David Keith as Elvis Presley,  this movie could brighten even the dullest mood with its simple charm, humour and wonderful music.  Some have complained about the lack of facial likeness between Mr. Keith and 'the King' as if that was an error of some kind rather than focusing on the fact that Mr. Keith  captures the essence of Elvis without having to rely on physical likeness which can only testify to this great actor's limitless capabilities, so much so, that there are moments when Elvis almost appears  transfigure through David Keith, who incidently is also a native of the State of Tennessee.  No-one ever intended this movie to be taken seriously, but only enjoyed for its sheer entertainment value.  The majority of the singing is actually performed by David Keith himself, which no Elvis impersonator could top !!  I have read reviews of this movie which cast doubt on this fact, but if you watch the end titles you will see his vocal performing credits. I also know that he used his own voice because HE told me in person during several chats I had with him whilst he was here in Hope, BC with James Spader filming the upcoming movie 'The Stick-Up'.  Charlie Schlater is also an immensely talented actor with the same kind of natural charisma and talent of Michael J. Fox.  As I said previously,  all the cast are magnificent and obviously adored making this movie as their pleasure and happiness shines through.  Remember, this is not an Elvis biography, but merely a fantasy tale which in its own way honours the memory of the real Elvis. A heartfelt tribute to 'the King'.  David Keith can also be seen in 'An Officer and a Gentleman'; 'U-571'; 'Men of Honor'; 'Brubaker'; 'The Rose'; 'The Lords of Discipline'; 'Major League 2'; and 'Texas'  among many others.",993168000,17,1919,4.810975609756097
1725357,5,B000068MBY,"Heartbreak Hotel is one of my favorite movies. The only bad news is that amazon.com tells us the picture is currently unavailable because the studio isn't making it in the VHS format.
It's a strange spin on the Elvis myth,  a story in which an Ohio teen (Charlie Schlatter) unites his troubled  mother (Tuesday Weld) with Presley (David Keith) by kidnapping The King  during a tour stop in Cleveland.
All three do fine work in the improbable  tale, during which young rock'n'roller Schlatter ends up getting musical  and romantic advice from Keith.
The Presley character sees a great deal  of himself in the troubled teen played by Schlatter, who at first totally  rejects Presley as an early-1970s caricature and Vegas performer who had  lost touch with teens of that period.
The music is wonderful in this  picture, including lots of obscure Elvis performances like ""If I Can  Dream"" and ""American Trilogy,"" and some things off THE  MEMPHIS RECORD.
Keith played Presley in some TV specials as well, and is  at his best when he duets with Schlatter onstage at a high school talent  show near the end of the picture.
All in all, Heartbreak Hotel is a very  imaginative story and an absolute must-see (out of curiosity if nothing  else) for the ever-increasing number of Presley fans around the  worldwide.

And the actors looked bored.  I will say on a positive note, that the Elvis impersonator was not bad.  He needed a more realistic and more engaging script though.  Maybe if you are a huge Elvis fan this movie ""might"" keep you awake.  And it was absolutely the worst blu ray quality transfer I've ever seen period.

1725384,4,B000068MBY,"You don't have to be an Elvis fan for this this to be a fun movie, but it helps. Many reviewers on here are talking about the movie itself so let's get right down to it... the Blu-ray. First off, this was a Touchstone picture and, for my fellow Blu enthusiasts, Mill Creek licensed a handful of those titles for release. Mill Creek is not known for fantastic, re-mastered, super HD, crisp and clean, blow your socks off, poop your pants transfers; they're just not. They probably spent most of their budget on the license leaving little for much else. This is your typical Mill Creek release, a bit too grainy and lacking any features. That being said, here is the deal... This version does look better than the DVD and if you want it in its original aspect ratio (meaning widescreen) this will be the only place you'll find it (unless the laserdisc version was in wide, I'm not sure about that). Artwork is the original artwork from the film's release period and it comes in your standard Blu-ray case. All region so no matter your country, pop it in and enjoy. David Keith does a killer job as the king and it has just enough of that 80's cheese that makes it nice and tasty. Mill Creek has brought us a release, be thankful. Fans of Elvis or of this film will sure to be all shook up.",1421366400,3,1287,4.366666666666666

Picture Quality: Die hard fans of this film can buy with confidence and be pleased.  A few things need to be given more serious consideration.  The film has always had a soft look to it.  This BD release pretty much proves that in my opinion.  This purchase was a triple dip for me having owned it on VHS, DVD, and now BD.  From what I have read; this is the very first widescreen release of the film on home video.  Not even the Laser Disc was released in its original aspect ratio of 1:85.  The home video releases have all been saddled with the pan & scan, cropped 4:3 ratio from the beginning.  Seeing this film on my large screen in its original aspect ratio was a revelation!  I was blown away with the level of detail in scene after scene after scene compared to the crap home video releases up to this point.  No one should give this thing a low score without first considering the source elements.  It's clear that Mill Creek gave the fans a true HD scan of what they were able to acquire from Disney.  I'm frankly shocked the print was in as good a shape as it was.  It's a miracle this little gem ever saw a High Resolution release at all.  I'm still floored after having sat through it for the first time amazed at the upgrade from my old pan & scan DVD.  It's clear that Mill Creek did not do any Digital Noise Reduction from the look of the source print they were given and bless them for it!  The film grain is completely intact allowing for very fine detail to come through whenever the director intended for it to look that way.  The only way you are going to get this thing to 4 or 5 star picture quality is with a full restoration of the film and that just isn't going to happen.  This film isn't loved by enough people to warrant a multi-million-dollar restoration.  I wish it were.  It deserves it in my opinion.  The smaller your screen is the less you will notice a difference unless you pull your chair up closer which I would challenge you to do if you aren't noticing a difference between your old pan & scan 4:3 dvd or vhs tape.  All other home video releases are non-anamorphic.  This BD alone is a huge upgrade in that respect.  If you have never watched this film and you are expecting a razor sharp appearance like most modern films; you will be disappointed.  However, if you grew up watching this thing on crap home video releases like I did and then see the BD in a moderate to large screen format I think you will be as pleased as I was.  Is there room for improvement regarding black level?  Heck yeah.  Is it perfect?  Far from it.  Is it an upgrade from previous home video releases?  Big time!!!!!

Audio Quality:  Nothing special.  Basically the same as the DVD which is a real shame.  It would have been awesome to get a lossless audio soundtrack on this one, but I'm thankful that it's even out to begin with on BD.

Final Comments:  If you are a fan; just grab it.  It's a steal at its current price on Amazon and well worth the usual price if you miss the sale.  If you have never seen it; you won't go wrong with a blind buy at this price, but don't expect the PQ of something like ""The Dark Knight.""",1421020800,2,3204,4.240066225165563

I saw this movie in the early 90's with my kids,in my opinion it is a good family movie.

1725406,4,B000068MBY,"Written and directed by Chris Columbus (writer of GREMLINS, director of the first two HOME ALONE movies & the first two HARRY POTTER movies), HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a comedy with a dash of romance. It's a fictional story that takes place in 1972. Johnny Wolfe (Charlie Schlatter) is a high school senior who lives with his younger sister and his mother in a small hotel called the Flaming Star in Taylor, Ohio. Johnny has his own band and they are pretty good and he just wants to play some rock and roll. However, The Wolfetones have never been able to play at the largest gig of the year in Taylor: the annual high school talent competition. Each year the judges come up with some lame excuse about why The Wolfetones (Johnny's band) can't play. Johnny's mother, Marie (Tuesday Weld) loves her kids and is doing her best to raise her kids and run the hotel, but she longs for some romance in her life. Instead, she ends up dating dead-beats. She's also crazy about Elvis. After Marie's latest boyfriend beats her and sends her to the hospital when they are in a car accident, Johnny decides he's going to do something really special for his mom. He's going to get Elvis to go on a date with his Mom. At first Johnny's friends think he's crazy, but soon they are caught up in his crazy idea, too. Elvis is coming to Cleveland and that's where they'll make their move.

The first extended scene with Elvis occurs after his arriving at his hotel in Cleveland. It is here that we see an Elvis that is struggling and on the brink; he's a man on the edge who longs for someone or something to reach out and bring him back inside. In many ways, HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a movie about what could have happened. It makes wonder if something like this had happened, would Elvis have ended up dying in a bathroom floor just five years later.

Like many of Chris Columbus' pictures, HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a little movie with a lot of heart. David Keith portrays Elvis and he does a spectacular job. Keith doesn't look exactly like Elvis, but he embodies the spirit of the man before he was completely corrupted by drugs and alcohol. The Elvis of HEARTBREAK HOTEL is one that loves cheeseburgers, who is used to getting his way, but still tries to appease his fans. At the same time, he's a lonely and broken man who feels he's forgotten and perhaps lost who he really is. This is an Elvis that still has hope.  That hope is given a chance to blossom when Elvis checks into HEARTBREAK HOTEL. It's a feel-good place of second chances that won't always let you feel lonesome tonight.",1327536000,,2560,4.477516059957173
1725407,5,B000068MBY,"Heartbreak Hotel was very touching. I rented it a while back and had to own it. It's campy in places, but beautifully done showing 'Elvis' just having fun as a person and not the 'star'. David Keith does a great job. Incorporating some of Elvis' scenes and music was very well done. It made me smile, laugh, and by the end I had tears in my eyes wondering 'what if'. I miss him.",1323820800,,378,4.191780821917808

He played CLeveland in ' 71 , and Pittsburgh in ' 73. The other inacuracy is that when he's on the motorcycle to go hunt down Johnny , it showed him on the motorcycle but the wheels aren't turning which is poor video and should've been caught in the editing room .

1725415,5,B000068MBY,"From the beginning HEARTBREAK HOTEL wants us to know that the story it is going to tell us has nothing whatsoever to do with the real life of Elvis Presley. In fact it proclaims;
""In the kingdom of rock and roll
There are many legends,
But only one King.
This is a fable about him.
The time is 1972.""

The story that unfolds takes place in the small town of Taylor, Ohio, a depressed and depressing place where Marie Wolfe (Tuesday Weld) owns a small hotel called the Flaming Star, named in honor of an Elvis presley movie. Marie's life has always revolved around Elvis as did her husband's before he ran off with another woman and left her alone ages ago to raise their two kids, Johnny who's about 17(played by Charlie Schlatter)and Pammie who's considerably younger. Marie's life has degenerated into boozing it up every night with a series of boyfriends, her latest being Steve who isn't exactly popular with Johnny, but then none of her boyfriends have been big with him. After a fight over breakfast one morning Johnny stomps off. He's definitely the adult in their relationship and he's tired of having to shoulder all the responsibility. Besides, he has troubles of his own; his band The Wolfetones has been rejected 3 years in a row for the school talent show and, even, worse, he hasn't got a prayer with the girl of his dreams-- Beth,who auditions for the show by playing Dylan's ""Positively 4th Street"" as if it were a classical piece on the piano, and when asked who the composer was she replies ""An obscure 20th century artist."" Johnny adores her; she's got beauty and guts!

Wouldn't you know it? Just when things on the home-front seem to be improving, the plot sickens. After a night at the drive-in watching yet another old Elvis movie, Johnny and his mother bond in a way they never had before. They start to really talk, have a meaningful dialogue and all sorts of other stuff that would make Dr. Phil perk up hopefully. Then, alas, Steve shows up and Johnny is left waiting on the couch for Mom to come back ""in 10 minutes"". As it turns out she did have a good excuse for staying out all night though, they were in a car accident and she wound up in the hospital...after they had an argument and he slapped her around a little first of course. That does it for Johnny. He has to take some sort of action. He simply can't bear seeing his mother so unhappy anymore. He has to find some way to cheer her up and fix her up.

Then he sees the article in the newspaper; Elvis is appearing in Cleveland on Saturday! Talk about fortuitous, and really short notice! That's when the brilliant idea springs into his mind fully formed--he'll get Elvis to go on a date with his mother! THAT OUTTA DO IT! So with about a day and a half at most to concoct and carry out his diabolical scheme, Johnny and his friends swing into action with the help of Rosie at the pizza place, an enormous pink Cadillac, a bottle of ether, and a lifetime's worth of knowledge of Elvis his mother had imparted to him. How could he fail?

He doesn't. And the next morning he has a soon-to-be-pissed-off Elvis lying unconcious on a couch in one of the hotel's unused rooms. Pammie studies Elvis and asks Johnny what he's going to do with him. Johnny says, ""Give him to Mom as a welcome home present."" ""I think she'll like him better than the earrings I got her,"" she replies.

If I've made this movie sound dreary or gloomy or dismal in anyway, please disregard whatever it was that I said that made you feel that way. This is not some boring fim about a disfunctional family, this is a comedy through and through--its just that its a comedy with a very big heart and a weird premise. All that stuff about Johnny's mother is simply a set up for the rest of film, and even THAT isn't totally devoid of humor. Once Elvis (played by David Keith) enters stage right, things turn into every fan's idea of what it would be like to kidnap their favorite singer/actor. He behaves exactly as Elvis should behave; he's arrogant and isolated and lonely but it turns out that what he's really needed all along was to get to be a regular person again (and eat copious amounts of really greasy cheeseburgers),if just for a little while. It just that Elvis' ideas of ""a regular person"" aren't quite the same as everyone else's.

 Life lessons are learned, truths are exchanged, Charlie learns how to be cool and Elvis remembers what cool really is, and everyone emerges the better for their having met, including the audience. This is another entry in my JUST PLAIN FUN Movie Category, and You don't have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy it. You can take my word for that since I have NEVER been an Elvis fan and saw this film originally simply because it got some good reviews from both Siskel AND Ebert. It wasn't long after that I bought my first vhs copy and later my dvd.

All of the performances are first rate. David Keith and Charlie Schlatter have the most screen time with most of the weight falling on David Keith, 'cause if you ain't buying Elvis you ain't got a movie, right? Some critics thought that 1988 was too soon for a movie of this type, that Elvis was still too fresh in our minds and that David Keith bore little resemblance to him physically. That didn't bother me at the time and it bothers me even less now. Both Keith and Schlatter are very engaging actors who are more than capable of making us accept the film's somewhat looney premise, and in the process they also manage to bring an unexpected amount of depth to what could have been mere cardboard characters in the hands of lesser talents. They also both do their own singing in this film and I think they do a slam bang job of it. There may be better Elvis imitators than Keith, but I seriously doubt that they are as good an actor as he is, and you need both qualities to make this character work--the part calls for an actor not an aper. Schlatter is the teenager every mother would want as a son, and Weld is totally convincing as the lonely mother who barely looks older than her son. She has always been somewhat under-rated inspite of excellent performances in her youth in such films as PRETTY POISON and SOLDIER IN THE RAIN.

I just looked at this review--my God, no one is going to read all of this! However I would like to add one thing for posterity; THIS ISN'T A FABLE, its more like a fairy tale. The Elvis presented here is pure and clean and unreal. I don't think he even drinks a beer much less suffers from drug withdrawl which obviously would have been the case in real life. In a fable some moral is usually presented at the end, and there is none here. This is more like Spielberg's E.T. where the strange loveable creature has to return to his own planet at the end, never to return again.",1219881600,11,6760,4.423293172690763

The plot is early 1970's rock verses Elvis ... Could Elvis have hung on to the young crowd if he maintained his edge.  That is the question the movie tries to answer and in any good feel good movie the answer is yes.  It is an Elvis ROCKY story. I love Elvis, I love the tone, I love question it asks and the respect for both sides it gives, and I love the way it was played by the actors.
