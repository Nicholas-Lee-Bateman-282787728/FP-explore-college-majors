8507881,4,B0070YJ6TU,"Oz Vessalius is the privileged son of one of the four Great Dukes and heir to his father's title. He leads an idyllic life with his little sister and best friend/servant, Gilbert. But on his 15th birthday, during his Coming of Age Ceremony, he is attacked by a strange group of people who throw him into a different dimension, a dark prison known as the Abyss. There he meets Alice, a strange girl with the power to turn into a large black rabbit with great strength. After she saves him from a creature called a Chain, he agrees to enter a contract with her in order to return to his world.

In this set we get a glimpse of what happened to Alice before she lost her memory, Oz is reunited with Aida, and a character is introduced who may know something about the melody Oz's pocket watch plays. Xerxes past is explained, but most of the new material is more mysteries, more questions to be answered. And unfortunately, most of them are not answered. Not in the anime anyway. The manga (which I have not read) is currently at 17 volumes in Japan and is still ongoing. It is being published here in the US and is at 10 volumes right now, with 4 more scheduled for release. I didn't know this until after I watched the last episode and was like ""What the h*** happened to the answers?"" There is no second season. The anime ends with most of the big mysteries unexplained. I still recommend this show, but know what you are getting into.

About the DVDs: Audio is Japanese only, English subtitles. Extras include several Omake episodes and clean opening and ending. The only difference between the Standard and the Premium is that the latter comes with a 32 page hardcover art book. This set comes with 2 DVDs and contains episodes 14-25.

UPDATE 5/14: It was recently announced that the manga would be ending with volume 23. It is very unlikely that the anime would ever be continued, but at least the end of the story will be available if you are so inclined.",1341532800,6,1959,4.451253481894151
