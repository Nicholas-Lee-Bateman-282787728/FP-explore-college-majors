8124543,3,B000FL87NG,Not what I had in mind,1438387200,,22,2.8333333333333335
8124544,5,B000FL87NG,Really Well-Done! Clearly and methodically explained and demonstrated! Excellent!,1435622400,,81,8.11111111111111
8124545,5,B000FL87NG,"What a nice dvd I had purchased some dvd's on jazz piano but it seems only the instructor wanting to dazzle you with his playing, basically concerts and no real instructional information or just teaching you one song in one key.  I have played the piano off and on for 10+ years so I can read music but struggle with playing and improvising along to fake books this dvd shows you how to play along to some standards and covers some comping while playing with other musicians.  I recommend also study a book on jazz voicings to go along with this and get your jar ready for tips at the lounge.",1413331200,4,592,4.324324324324325
8124546,2,B000FL87NG,"this was a pretty basic book. Not for an experienced player already exposed to the jazz canon.
 It did not go very far in discussing improvisation possibiligties for the tunes in the book.
But for a beginner, just getting into themusic and the repertoire, it's fine",1386374400,,265,4.760869565217392
8124547,5,B000FL87NG,"This is definitely not for beginners, but inspiring to advance to where it would be helpful. I loved to watch his playing and absorb his instuction.",1371859200,,148,4.730769230769231
8124548,5,B000FL87NG,I like to know as much as i can about jazz piano concept. This DVD is simple enough to follow. If the lesson repeats more and slower will be better for someone like me.,1364515200,,168,3.9705882352941178
8124549,5,B000FL87NG,Per Danielson is an excellent teacher of how to play jazz standards!  He always states which chords he is playing and how they are voiced.  A significant improvement in my piano playing!,1345680000,,186,4.78125
8124550,5,B000FL87NG,"Per Danielsson takes the viewer through several standard tunes in an organized, easy to follow, step-by-step fashion. His style is very approachable and each tune ends nicely with a talented quartet performance. The focus is on teaching the aspiring jazz pianist, not dazzling folks with technical fireworks. Definitely for intermediate to advanced players -- knowledge of music theory (harmony & structure) is helpful. With sufficient dedicated practice, this video will take your playing to a higher level.",1303948800,11,508,5.6103896103896105
8124551,5,B000FL87NG,"I liked this DVD immediately.  The arrangements not only sound nice, but also provide the student with a solid basis for increasing his or her technique.  The presentation is easy to follow and enables the beginner/intermediate player to begin sounding like a professional almost immediately.  Well worth the investment.  I wish that there were more DVDs like this.",1195948800,10,365,5.241379310344827
