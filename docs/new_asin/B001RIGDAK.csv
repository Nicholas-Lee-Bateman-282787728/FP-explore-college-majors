for her instead and she loved it.  Very entertaining.",1422403200,,134,4.115384615384615
8338057,5,B001RIGDAK,"No, No, if I only had five ballets to choose from, I don't think one of them would be a Trock ballet, but maybe out of 50 I'd choose one even two. And yes, I do have two. These guys are indeed FUNNY, I admit. Remarkable too. They mean to be funny, but were they to put their minds to it, they can dance just as gracefully as many ballerinas. When I first started watching ballet (it hasn't been very long) I didn't think men could dance on point the way these do, but these guys are good, and what art form is better suited to parody than ballet. They do the only ""Dying Swan"" that doesn't make me cry. OK, I'm a sentimental old fool. I wonder how Maya Plisetskaya feels about what they do to her most danced ballet. Oh well. If you want something to laugh about, buy these ballet DVDs both volumes 1 & 2.",1321228800,,805,4.069182389937107
8338058,5,B001RIGDAK,"The Trocks are a treasure that every ballet lover should see at least once live.  If you know and love ballet, you'll howl with laughter at the witty parody-on-pointe that these remarkable men do.  If you know nothing about ballet, you will howl with laughter at their comedic turns.  If I were to be stuck with only five ballet DVDs ever, two of them would be the Trocks disks.

Buy this for yourself as a much cheaper alternative to anti-depression drugs.",1260403200,4,457,4.604938271604938
