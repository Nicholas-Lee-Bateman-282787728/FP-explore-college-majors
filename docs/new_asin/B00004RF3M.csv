1342294,4,B00004RF3M,"This is a wonderful, classic Yuen Wo Ping movie.  It even stars Yuen Shun Yi, the star of Yuen Wo Ping's original sequel to Jackie's ""Drunken Master"", the amazing ""Dance of the Drunk Mantis"".  There is one, very large downside to this though, regardless of the accompanying  info Tai Seng printed to describe this disc, THERE ARE NO ENGLISH  SUBTITLES!  Please buyers beware!  I first learned this at  a wonderful website that includes a  synopsis of DVD quality for nearly every version of every Hong Kong DVD you  could imagine.  Please visit here before buying your next Hong Kong DVD.  You will find that some Hong Kong DVDs are of excellent quality, but you  will also find that some are of either bad quality, or are misadvertised.  ""The Buddhist Fist"", although a wonderful movie, is unfortunately  a prime example of the latter.",963100800,11,836,4.795774647887324
1342321,5,B00004RF3M,"This movie is one of my favorite martial arts movies of all time.
The acting and story is ok, but the kung fu is excellent.
The form of the monk/brother of the main character is precise, and his
style is creative and beautiful to watch.  Don't get hung up on
the other stuff and pay attention to what really on display here:
exquisite movement.",1219968000,,344,4.375
1342322,5,B00004RF3M,amazon is awesome I got free supersaver with my order and even though it took another 3-4 days it was worth it,1213747200,,110,4.045454545454546
1342323,5,B00004RF3M,"This movie is a classic for several reasons. Most importantly, the fight scenes are great and well coreographed. Secondly, the story is actually quite good. Lastly, the comedy in the movie is beyond what I would've thought. It's LOL funny at times. Especially the scene with the hunchback guy fighting with the chopsticks. That whole segment is worth buying the movie. Don't get me wrong the english dubbing is partly responsible for the humor, but it still had to be funny nonetheless. GET THIS MOVIE! You can't go wrong!",1199145600,,522,4.876404494382022
1342324,4,B00004RF3M,"Now this is old-school.  A fun, imaginitive film with really good fights.  The humor is mild, which is a plus.  The funniest thing in this flick is how Yuen Shun Yi's hair-cut frequently oscillates length and style.

Two orphans are raised by monks, go their separate ways, and are later reunited by tragedy.  There are little twists, but that's pretty much the story.  But as you know, story is not (usually) why we watch kung fu.  Care to calculate a guess?  That's right, the fights.  The choreography here is a nice stepping-stone between ""7 Grand Masters"", where the fights are lengthier and more acrobatic, and ""The Prodigal Son"", where they are faster and more precise.

Presentation here is inconsistent, as the film quality fluctuates a little, but mostly it's very good, and widescreen.  This is another gem that I'm sorry I didn't see sooner.  I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over.  You've seen better films in every individual aspect that this one has to offer, but it's still collectively great.  I even liked Simon Yuen in this.

1342325,4,B00004RF3M,"The movie is in itself, comical and action packed. These guys are a bit slow but they make up for it in technique. Some of the best. I give Woo-ping yuen his props for this one. If you like Kung Fu movies, this one should be in your library. The old man at the temple of the Jade Buddha has been around for a long time. They did a great job on his stunt double. However don't be fooled, this man can throw down i real life.

The old Monk in here is one of the best. And this movie is action packed from start to finish. A must see for Kung Fu fans.",1193011200,,548,3.807017543859649
1342326,5,B00004RF3M,"This was a shocker for me, i expected a slow paced half cut plot like most other martial arts movies made during the 70's and 80's but this was actually a shocker.  The plot was intresting and fun with a bit of a twist at the end.  Of course the fight sceens were far beyond what i expected and quite fun to watch. I would recomend anyone to watch this.",1190678400,,353,4.0285714285714285
1342327,4,B00004RF3M,"It's funny how they always advertise everything that Yuen Woo Ping is attached to with the slogan ""from acclaimed director/choreographer of The Matrix, Crouching Tiger, and Kill Bill.""  Really it's the Kung Fu gems he released in the early days like this that should be referred to as his best work!  Hot on the heels of a string of big hit movies (Snake In The Eagles Shadow, Drunken Master, Magnificient Butcher) Yuen dropped this semi-forgettable (when compared to the previous group especially) but entertaining film.  The story here is nothing new (although it does provide a nice mystery twist albeit a rather obvious one) and puts our central character (and master of The Buddhist Fist) on a quest to find his father who has gone missing.  Along the way he meets the usual assortment of friends and foes (sporting Yuen trademarks like hairy moles and buck teeth!)with plenty of great old-fashioned (hardly any wire work) Kung Fu mixed in.  The only real complaint I have with the film is the hunchback character... he was just way too over the top for me personally.  Beyond that there is no reason any self-respecting martial arts fan shouldn't see this as they truly don't make them like this anymore.  The DVD is about what you would expect from Tai Seng, with their usual ""remastered transfer"" looking almost like a Kalidascope at times (the final fight changes colors basically from shot to shot)and bonus features that consist of a Yuen Woo Ping filmography and some trailers (including an amusing trailer for Wing Chun that starts with an announcer saying ""Watch out Jean-Claude... Move over Arnold...""?!).",1189814400,2,1620,4.955719557195572
1342328,5,B00004RF3M,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie.  I though this flick was genuinely entertaining from start to finish.  I mean, not only was the kung fu simply amazing,,but it was really funny; example,,the scene with the lady and her cow which got raped but her neighbour's bull,,,that police captine was too much!!

This flick is easily up there among my top 10 best old school kung fu!!",1147651200,2,373,4.707692307692308
1342329,3,B00004RF3M,"This movie is for entertainment value. The acting is poor, the dialogue lacking and the ""plot"" not original. That being said, it has some great fight scenes. Certainly I bought it just to get the final battle into my library. Do not be fooled however, the action is really good in the other scenes as well but thaey are all overshadowed by the final battle.. There is much comedy. "" Young man, let me tell your fortune. hmm.. weak chin, beady eyes, prominent forhead lacks character...the future doen's look good for you!"" the reply.. "" If you can see the future then tell me... Where is..."" LOL!!  This is a really predicatble story but never the less enjoyable. If the film transfer quality and acting were better, then the rating would be higher. Over all a reasonal DVD purchase.",1145318400,2,783,4.633093525179856
1342330,5,B00004RF3M,excellent film directed by a genuis Yuen Woo ping one of my top five films that has involved Yuen Woo Ping and Simon Yuen the old man in drunken master last film before he died a must see film to die hard martial arts films fans Classic.,1127260800,3,237,4.0638297872340425
1342341,4,B00004RF3M,This is one of the first Woo-ping yuen movies I ever watched. I rented it and like it so much that I had to go buy it.,1125446400,2,118,3.4074074074074074
1342342,4,B00004RF3M,"The Buddhist Fist traces the lives of two friends, one of whom is a Buddhist monk.  Unwittingly, the monk is framed and must resort to misdeeds to keep from being blackmailed.  His misdeeds put him at odds with his lifelong friend (the same actor who played the villian, White Tiger, in Dreadnaught), and ultimately into a final match of ""good vs. evil.""  Lots of well choregraphed action.

Note, however, two irritating features of the DVD: (a) for the first half of the film, there is a bothersome, vertical, hairline bar on the left side of the screen; (b) despite providing 5.1 Chinese audio, there are no English subtitles!  Too bad, since I prefer the original language audio, whenever possible.  Chalk it up to another, Tai Seng careless oversight.  In fact, I'd rather get the original Hong Kong release of this film in light of Tai Seng's frequent editing foibles.

5 stars for the production.  Deduct 1 star for the careless transfer.",1120694400,4,944,4.813664596273292

1342344,5,B00004RF3M,"This movie not only has some creative fight scenes, it also has some very funny scenes as well.  Some scenes will have you laughing, and not like other kung fu movies that are stupidly funny, this one is on purpose.

Recommended highly!",1093824000,2,236,4.595238095238095
1342345,5,B00004RF3M,"This movie has some of the best martial arts action ever filmed. Some reviewers don't think much of the plot but I think it's excellent. Can be watched over and over and over. The hero of the movie is one of the old school greats but usually he plays the evil bad guy. He does a great job as the good hearted hero in this one. His form is great and he is supposed to be the diligent fighter of the two main characters. However, the co-star monk fighter, WOW!, you have to see his style!! Perfect form, yet totally relaxed... He makes your spine tingle he is so good. This movie is never dull at any moment, always exciting and interesting. Great acting, great characters, very inspiring. An added bonus is the super old school Master that guards the temple... I have seen him in a few other movies... he is just plain spectacular. His footwork is among the finest I have ever seen. Even if you just want to be inspired or learn some new moves this movie is worth the price but, you get so much more than that. This is one of the best of all time and even though newer movies are produced better with better effects, etc., this movie is just plain fun plus is chock full of the best fight scenes ever put on film.",1089158400,10,1212,4.228448275862069
1342346,5,B00004RF3M,"Granted, the plot ain't much, and the production quality isn't on a par with Crouching Tiger.  Nonetheless, the fight scenes are well done and numerous.  As a bonus, you martial arts students out there can witness the only known example of Holy Ghost Fist ever to hit the silver screen.

you now you are in for a treat the digitally remastered dvd looks
great and also widescreen no complaints the ending fight scene is

now. I have not had one problem with the dvd and the picture.",1000857600,2,451,3.967032967032967
1342349,5,B00004RF3M,"The plot and characters may take a back seat to the fighting but, my god, what action scenes ! They reminded me alot of ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Matrix"" and for good reason since the same guy choreographed the fight scenes in all three. I honestly have no idea how they pulled it off ; the moves are absoulutley supernatural , even when you take into consideration the minimal special effects. Really, I'm shocked its not more well known. You'll be hard-pressed to find a Martial art film that comes close to this firey gem.",976838400,5,518,4.5212765957446805

Movie Review: This is one of my favorite Yuen Wo Ping's directed films ever. Though the eccentric slapstick is a bit of a turn off, the fight scenes and the story was really well done. Lots of variety in factitious kung fu styles, unusual yet appealing fight choreography and all that. Highly recommended if you can get past the lousy TAI Seng DVD.

Conclusion: 3 stars for the DVD and 4 1/2 stars for The Buddhist Fist.",1429056000,,653,4.52542372881356
