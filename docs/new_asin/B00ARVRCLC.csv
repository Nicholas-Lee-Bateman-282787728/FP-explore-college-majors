8557055,5,B00ARVRCLC,"Rod Taylor never disapoints, he is an amazing actor to capture the emotion of any scene, and commands our attention with a look.  Not to be missed by any fan.",1391904000,,158,4.266666666666667
8557056,4,B00ARVRCLC,"I have followed Rod Taylor since I was 16 - 50 years ago.  I like his presentation on the screen and enjoyed this DVD.  This production was part of an era that produced lots of action movies - good guy against bad guy and this has a very good script.  It is not his best nor are most of his roles.  He does best in romantic comedies.  Still, I will enjoy this DVD and will for many years to come.  Thanks to all who made it available to me.",1371859200,2,440,3.8876404494382024
8557057,5,B00ARVRCLC,"This is another Rod Taylor movie that I have a feeling very few people have seen. It was made a a TV show pilot but sadly didn't make it on the air. I seriously don't know why it didn't. It's fun to watch & ladies there are lots of scenes with Rod changing his shirt!!! :o) If you get the chance to buy this, do!!! You will not regret it. As for the seller: wonderful service.",1365033600,2,376,3.960526315789474
