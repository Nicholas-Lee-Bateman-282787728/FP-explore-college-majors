8468074,5,6303568416,"Bulldozer Songs - Real Rockin' Wheels Video is so much fun for little boys.  There are giant digging machines, dump trucks, and lots of implosions which everyone will love to see.  My grandsons wore out my first tape and I am buying new ones to give to the new little boys I know.  I wish it came in a DVD format because I think it would last longer.  There is a animated host named ""Rocky"" who is a bulldozer and he leads the children through all the construction areas.  The kids watch it over and over, be sure to help them with the rewind button because they will say ""again"", ""see it again"".",1215993600,,596,4.238938053097345
