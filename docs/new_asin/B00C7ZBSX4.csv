8578499,3,B00C7ZBSX4,"This movie is in the vein of Kentucky Fried Movie or The Groove Tube. The transfer looks as if it was done from a video cassette instead of an original print. None of the bits are particularly outstanding, but a few are funny.",1447113600,,226,4.27906976744186
8578500,3,B00C7ZBSX4,"This ""digitally remastered"" release from TGG Direct is from a full frame tape (VHS?) source.  Having said that, the picture quality is decent and probably as good as we're likely to get.  The movie itself, like THE GROOVE TUBE and TUNNEL VISION, hails from a time when sketch comedy in the vein of Saturday Night Live and Second City TV was still in its infancy and had not yet been perfected.  This is evident in the wildly uneven nature of the movie, which consists of a series of fake movie trailers - the movie is also known as COMING ATTRACTIONS.  There are a few funny moments, but mostly it is just weird and somewhat boring.  The large number of dated references doesn't help any either.  But there is one huge saving grace - the closing number DARKTOWN AFTER DARK is pure comedy brilliance and is so hilarious it almost makes the DVD worth buying on its own.  This number is an old time 40's style song and dance number based on a racist comment made by Gerald Ford's  Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz, who said ""I'll tell you what the coloreds want. It's three things: first, a tight pussy; second, loose shoes; and third, a warm place to s***."" (hence the title of the movie.  LOOSE SHOES features some early performance by Bill Murray and a few other familiar faces.",1424476800,,1280,4.530434782608696
8578501,4,B00C7ZBSX4,"Uneven but occasionally very funny, especially the final number.
By the way - Woody Allen is NOT in this movie.  That's David Landsberg (a regular on ""CPO Sharkey"", the only Don Rickles series to run longer than one season) playing a character called ""Duddy Allen"".",1407801600,2,265,4.888888888888889
8578502,2,B00C7ZBSX4,The film was not what I had imagined. My fault!! Subject matter was disappointing. Did not meet my expectations for humor.,1374364800,,122,4.857142857142857
