8080513,3,B000AYEL24,There is very little acting in this movie and the female co star made one movie and went into NY real estate . There is plenty of action and sort of a plot - the bad guy makes the movie more than the good guys - if you are a die hard Michael Dudikof fan - you will like this movie  - if not - I wouldn't bother.,1407715200,,311,3.573529411764706
8080514,4,B000AYEL24,"I have not watched the DVD as yet.  I saw it on TV some time ago.  Michael Dudikoff
is a favorite on mine.",1255305600,,106,3.5652173913043477
8080515,5,B000AYEL24,"If you like Dudikoff, explosions, over-the-top villains and R. Lee Ermey, you'll like this movie. If you like a hard-rock song over the end credits, good use of low-budget production values and a sexy sidekick chick who says corny lines to the hero like, ""You're good, real good,"" you'll like this movie. If you're smart enough to realize that there's going to be bad acting, dull fast-forward moments and a plot that , at times, is too complicated, but you are willing to overlook these flaws, then you'll like this movie. In short, if you like 80's,90's action movies, even ones that went direct to video, you'll like this film.",1242259200,11,630,4.736363636363636
8080516,4,B000AYEL24,"I have to say that I have always been fond of Michael Dudikoff ever since I saw him in ""American Ninja"" when I was a kid.  It is safe to say that anyone who knows the movie (and its sequels) ""American Ninja"" knows who Michael Dudikoff is.  For those of you who don't, Michael Dudikoff is an action star who was featured in many films produced by the ""Cannon Group"".  The ""Cannon Group"" pumped out many violent and exploitation types of films in the 1980s. Many of these movies featured Charles Bronson or Chuck Norris.  Oh if one was wondering, ""Chain of Command"" was produced by the ""Cannon Group"".

In this movie Michael Dudikoff plays Merrill Ross an American Special Forces agent who becomes pawn in a politic game of power between the CIA, the Middle East, Terrorists and Western Oil Company.  This might sound sort of confusing and befuddling and believe it or not it is.  I had a hard time keeping tally who was good, who was bad and what was the motive of each character.  Not that this movie had the greatest storyline in the world, but this pseudo duplicity of a plot gave this movie a slight elevation from your normal B action movie.

With regards to acting, nothing really wonderful, nothing really terrible.  Michael Dudikoff has quite the ""potty mouth"" in this movie.  I wish I had a quarter every time he dropped the ""F word"".  Nevertheless, Michael Dudikoff gives this movie a pizzazz which is somewhat refreshing, especially if you are only familiar with him from the ""American Ninja"" series.  The lead villain in this movie has a mullet that is so amazing; this mullet can only be believed by seeing it. As a matter of fact, I kept thinking this ""villain"" was a Megadeth roadie.

Overall this movie wasn't anything extravagant, all ""bad guys"" fell like bowling pins when Michael Dudikoff shoots them and the unneeded love interest was so pass&eacute;.  The DVD itself gives an entire new meaning to ""bare bones"", no trailer, no subtitles and no scene selection just a screen (the same as the DVD cover) that says ""play movie"".  I found this movie to be very enjoyable, others might too if their expectations are too high.

MICHAEL DUDIKOFF FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1232496000,5,2182,4.7
8080517,2,B000AYEL24,"For some reason I have to watch any movie that stars Michael DUDE-ikoff, especially if the film was produced by the notorious B-action Cannon Films corporation. This time the dude is in the middle east taking on terrorists and corrupt oil company big-wigs. At first glance this reminded my of the hilarious Steven Seagal film On Deadly Ground, but give me DUDE-ikoff anyday over Seagal.

This movie was made towards the end of the Cannon Films legacy and I don't think the company had a lot of money to spend, and it shows. The production values is of considerably less than their classic 80's films such as American Ninja and Invasion U.S.A., however it still comes off to be a fun NO-brain action flick with Dudikoff giving another hilarious, almost drugged performance. For fans of Cannon or B-Action flicks, this is a must. Just don't expect a steller presentation on DVD as the DVD is as basic as you can get. Full screen and NO special features.",1127001600,5,951,4.6946107784431135
