8148270,4,B000J0SPSA,"A very interesting compilation of Springfield's television performances but I'm not sure about Quiet Please, There's A Lady On Stage. It takes place in a live concert setting fairly late in Dusty's career. I would say sometime after the 1979 Royal Albert Hall concert.
Every song opens with an on screen title and a slight overlap, no breaks or commentary.
This DVD, (my copy) is PAL format, Region 0, DVD 5 (single layer), 5.1 audio, B & W, Color.(2006)
This disc is a low budget product and it shows. There is a disclaimer on the packaging that states -

Historical Recordings:
The recording techniques used to capture these historical performances cannot compare to modern audio and video standards.

This is someone's way of apologizing for indifferent quality.
Everything is presented 'as is', no restoration and quality varies. Playback is less than natural speed making video a little jerky, not really bad but noticeable. Live video here like some other PAL releases has been filtered or processed to appear like film, reducing definition.
Most of the color performances here are available on the Reflections DVD, a much higher quality release.
A casual or demanding Dusty fan may not enjoy People Get Ready but there are some real gems here that I haven't found anywhere else yet and they are very beautiful.
I give this title 2 stars for Audio quality, 3 stars for Video quality and 4 stars overall for Historical value.
It may not be for everyone but I do enjoy it.

There is a more recent (2008) version of this title available known as Dusty Springfield-You Don't Have To Say You Love Me.
Reviews at Amazon UK don't mention Video quality but sound is available in 2.0 and the original 5.1 surround.
I have no experience with the more recent release at this time.",1480896000,,1775,4.81311475409836
