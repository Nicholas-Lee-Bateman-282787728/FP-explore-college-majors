The girls nearly lose but in the end, pull together and win as always.  I didn't much like the fighting because it got a little harsh, but it's excellent the way it was shown.

Contains the episodes:

9 - The Black Seajack!  Crash Over the Ocean!

10 - Destruction of Great Tokyo!?  Farewell Warriors!

11 - Last Match, Warriors Super Battle!

12 - Go Warriors!  To Infinity and Beyond!",1121040000,,524,4.468085106382978
