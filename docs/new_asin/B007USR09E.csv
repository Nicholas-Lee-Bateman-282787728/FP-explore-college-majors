8522003,1,B007USR09E,"I bought this DVD because it featured the beautiful,sexy and intelligent Gloria Leonard. If,in advance, I knew the content of this disc I would not have purchased it.""Kink-O-Rama"",the main feature on this DVD was made for only one purpose. That was to fleece the customer. Intentionally ripping off paying customers was unacceptable in 1976. It  is unacceptable now. This film (and I am not sure it can be defined as a film) is simply a collection of recycled,not very interesting ,European porn loops. Gloria Leonard has been roped in to present them. She plays a psychiatrist treating a dysfunctional married couple. The loops are her treatment. This film fails on every level. The loops are boring ( a couple of the women are interesting).Gloria Leonard's  sex scenes,she engages in realatively mild sex with the married couple, are tepid and unenthusiastic. These two aspects mean this  is a poor porn film. The Gloria Leonard scenes are also too dark. Despite digital remastering,the technical quality is poor. There are some additional loops on this DVD.These are also boring and silly. They are mainly bondage loops. Bondage loops are often another kind of rip off. Just tie up a guy or a girl.  Pretend to hit them with something and that's about it. Little or no sex required. The erotic appeal of this stuff is lost on  me. Apart from the appearance of Gloria Leonard this DVD has no redeeming features.",1434844800,4,1413,4.920168067226891
