7852497,1,6303507611,"This is advertised as a DVD, but it is a DVD-R (and no, I did not buy from another merchant, but directly from amazon). It is not in the correct screen dimensions - the title cards common with silent movies are clearly cut (parts of the last word at the right of the screen are missing). And then, the camera shakes uncontrollably, much more than it the norm for movies of this vintage. It says its 78 minutes ""complete"" but guess what, the version on youtube is much longer (and of higher quality).",1455667200,5,499,4.376344086021505
7852498,2,6303507611,"I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. On second thought and second viewing I believe that though the DVD-R format SHOULD be mentioned in the product description, this is probably the only way that rare films that can never hope to see commercial release can be made available. The print is not great, but I've seen worse and been able to enjoy the film. So sorry GrapeVine.",1322611200,,420,4.5394736842105265
7852499,3,6303507611,"Released shortly before America entered World War I, producer Thomas Ince's ""Civilization"" (1916) was an ambitious, partially successful attempt to match the artistry and scale of D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation."" By incorporating religious symbolism with social commentary, Ince and director Raymond West crafted a film that struck a responsive chord with the audiences of its day. However, once America became involved in the war, ""Civilization"" was withdrawn from circulation. Despite its historic significance, Ince's pacifist epic languished in obscurity until recent years. Though marred by weak acting and dated melodrama, the picture remains of historic interest for its antiwar sentiments and religious message. ""Civilization"" did not prevent America from going to war, but it did help the country find a spiritual and moral unity during that turbulent period.",1266105600,2,876,5.694656488549619
7852500,3,6303507611,"Two blockbuster films with a pacifist message were released in 1916, Thomas Ince's 'Civilization' and Herbert Brenon's 'War Brides.' Both were very popular and preached a strong anti-war message... They have often been cited as having helped to re-elect Woodrow Wilson on a peace platform...

The hero of 'Civilization' is a submarine commander who refuses to torpedo a passenger vessel because he is secretly a devoted follower of the pacifist Mothers of Men Society... He is murdered by the mutinous crew and his soul is eventually redeemed by Christ... Jesus then assumes the dead man's form to plead the cause of peace before the king... He is successful and the king hastens to recall his soldiers...",1233273600,,705,5.077586206896552
7852501,5,6303507611,"This is another superb and special film from the First American Features 1912-1918 series (wish there were many more like these!) which makes a bold and daring statement, namely that we're not civilized if we go to war. The emphasis is on the Christian principle to ""love thy neighbor"" and even Christ himself is active in this unusual film, helping war-greedy humans to realize the tragedy of war and turn to peace instead. It would be a strong anti-war protest even in our day, and one wonders how this 1916 pacifict cry would be received today. But it's still more than just a powerful message for peace and Christianity because we are shown real people that tug at our heart-strings: the old mother whose son is forced to join the army, the children afraid of never seeing their father again, and even a horse trying to rouse its dead rider with its hoof. The spotlight is on one man who has a change of heart during the war when ordered to sink a cruise ship with innocent women and children on board, and due to the sacrifice he then makes, he receives Christ's spirit into his body to preach peace instead. Despite its strong religious impact, the entire film with its excellent scenes and images make it quite compelling viewing even for the non-religious. The picture quality is extremely good, and the intertitles short and to the point, making it overall a most outstanding and special film well worth having.",1091404800,,1420,4.684
