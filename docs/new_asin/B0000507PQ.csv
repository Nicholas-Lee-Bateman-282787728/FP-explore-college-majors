7928746,4,B0000507PQ,"I bought this video as a gift for my husband. He was thrilled when he opened the package and wanted to watch it right away. I put it into our DVD player and got an error message saying the playback feature may not be available on this disc. Thinking there was some kind of problem with the disc I immediately contacted Amazon and requested a replacement. The exchange went fine, no problems there. The new disc arrived today but unfortunately the same error message appears when trying to run it on our DVD player. I tried putting the disc in my PC and it runs fine there thank goodness. Unfortunately my husband prefers to view videos on the TV as the picture is larger and easier for him to see. We will keep the disc but wish there was no problem playing it through the DVD player.",1293753600,,784,4.340136054421769

7928749,5,B0000507PQ,"I have seen many programs on military aircraft ranging from dog-
fighting to the desert storm , yet all seem to have come short at
one piont. They never give significant detail on the aircraft.
This program is different. Ultimate Dogfighting gives an in-depth
look at the aircraft, pilots, and manuvers that our and other
armed forces use. Not only does it have a range of aircraft it
also gives you views of the cockpit and all of the controls and
flightstick buttons. Plus, with an bonus footage sections
featuring a precise look at the F-16, this DVD is worth the money
and will keep you keep you pausing it to look at the awesome
still picture.",984960000,36,648,4.547008547008547
