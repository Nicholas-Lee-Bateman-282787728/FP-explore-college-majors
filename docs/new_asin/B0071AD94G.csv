5047148,5,B0071AD94G,Absolutely love these dvds! The messages are clear and awesome for kids and adults! I wish they were longer they're so good!,1394150400,,124,4.681818181818182
5047149,5,B0071AD94G,My kids view the Theo series at their Sunday school class and are so excited to get to watch it at will now. Such a brilliant illustration of the bible and Gods love for us. Superb.,1370390400,,181,4.055555555555555
5047150,5,B0071AD94G,We love the Theo series! Highly recommend them for teaching good Biblical theology to kids. Would also be good to use in a church setting.,1370304000,2,138,4.56
5047151,4,B0071AD94G,"My only criticism is the ""gospel"" presentation is lacking (repentance, and a decent explanation of sin...). Altogether, great resource, though!",1356048000,,143,6.2
8508079,5,B0071AD94G,Was a gift for my grandson's second birthday. He enjoys sitting and watching it with his daddy before bed.,1491004800,,106,4.631578947368421
8508080,2,B0071AD94G,"I am seventeen years old, so you might correctly guess that I do not personally enjoy it. Some of my younger siblings enjoy it though. I like the way Theo teaches very good things about God, but I think he talks and looks a little funny. What I really dislike about the show, though, is the weird drawings of the characters in the stories that are told. I think they look awful! I say Theo God's Grace would certainly be a better show without those ugly looking drawings!

As an older teenage boy, my favorite tv show is Little House on the Prairie. It is a show a lot of Christians enjoy watching, and I recommend it.",1480118400,,618,4.282051282051282
8508081,5,B0071AD94G,"This is an excellent video series. I wrote a fuller review on ""Teaching children God's Word"". But this is my favorite resource for helping children learn the biblical story. So creative and excellently written. Biblically sound.",1467763200,,228,5.361111111111111
8508082,5,B0071AD94G,"I absolutely recommend THEO. My kids and I love it. It is not watered down and the message of the gospel is well presented. There are 5 DVDs total with 3 episodes in each dvd and the ""good news"" is at the end of every dvd. Each episode (what is the church?, road to Romans, the fruit of the spirit, abiding in Christ, adoption, etc) is explained very well and it's so adorable and so well made! I haven't seen many kids Christian cartoons/DVDs that actually teach doctrine but THEO definitely does. Just because kids are young it doesn't mean that they can't understand theology or we shouldn't teach them that because it's deep.  I find it disappointing that most materials for kids are shallow and fluffy these days. My only dissapointment is that I wish there were more THEO DVDs.",1466812800,,783,4.553191489361702
8508083,5,B0071AD94G,"It's hard to find biblical children movies that aren't just silly and roughly sticks to a bible story. This movie does a GREAT job keeping true to Gods word AND having something all kids will like. I can't wait to get the other 4!!  I just love how the use a ""diorama"" to explain the stories. How clever!",1458000000,,304,4.241379310344827
8508084,5,B0071AD94G,My kids love watching Theo!,1455753600,,27,4.6
8508085,5,B0071AD94G,May grand kids love Theo,1455494400,,24,4.0
8508086,4,B0071AD94G,"Another solid set of lessons from the ""The"" series. Quality content, short & simple lessons, and very nice illustration. We previously order tthree DVDs from this series and look forward to purchasing more, to build on what the kids have seen (and enjoyed).",1402617600,,257,5.0
8508087,5,B0071AD94G,This has been requested over and over again to watch. I LOVE these series! Totally solid! These are MUCH better than Veggie Tales!,1401753600,,130,4.695652173913044
8508088,5,B0071AD94G,This shows how God is full of compassion and is not angry with us butt wants us to be filled with His directives. Great for kids and for parents to share the truth of grace in the family and with each other.,1399593600,,207,3.9523809523809526
