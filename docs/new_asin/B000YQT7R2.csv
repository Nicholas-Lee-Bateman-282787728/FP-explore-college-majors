While hampered by a low budget, Trained to Kill USA has some potential, and with a little better story, stronger direction, and more violence and some nudity in the right places, the film could have been an early exploitation classic.  Unfortunately, although there are many opportunities to deliver some major shocks, the film largely falls short of achieving what it could have.

After receiving medical treatment for war related stress, ex-airborne ranger Olie Hand (Steve Sandor) returns to the Arizona ranch where his parents and sister live, to find that the family has just had an encounter with a couple of petty thieves.  The men escape, but later decide to return to steal some weapons, but run into Hand's tough as nails, shotgun wielding father (Richard X. Slattery).

Rockne Tarkington, perhaps familiar to some, as the character ""Morgan"" on ""Danger Island"", the serial featured on the kids show The Banana Splits (1968), plays Prophet, the leader of a group of opportunistic criminals.  Tarkington gives the most interesting performance, bringing some humanity to a character that is supposed to be a cold-hearted killer.

Hand briefly displays his fighting skills, during a violent but extremely short fight scene at the film's conclusion.

Although there is enough violence to make it worth a watch for B-movie fans, the film squanders many opportunities to break new ground.

We see a room with photographs of a soldier. Mark looks at one photo. Two men drive a black hearse away from a store. This story seems to be set in the arid southwest, like Arizona. Those two men stop at a lone house for water. There is trouble now. Dust clouds tell of an approaching vehicle. ""Let the sheriff handle it"" says Mom. Those two men go back to a carnival show. [These provided entertainment to small towns in olden days.] There is some trouble at this carnival, it attracts transients. ""That is evidence."" The bad guys talk to each other. The leader warns them not to talk to anyone else. A man walks into a bar for comic relief. ""Be free!"" Asking directions from a stranger? ""What did you do in Vietnam?"" They were Airborne Rangers. Those men enter the motor home. There is trouble now.

Olie doesn't talk about his past. There is horseplay with Wally. The soldiers leave. There is trouble at the gas station. Will they look for revenger or plan a robbery? [No dog to bark a warning at an isolated farmhouse?] A shot tells the burglars they are discovered! But they get away with weapons. The Sheriff is looking for a carnival man. The villains have a plan: when the townspeople are at the carnival they will rob the bank. [An original idea?] Cars and motorcycles ride toward town. Are they prepared? Shots announce trouble from the bank robbery. Bodies fall like some war movie. The bad guys show up at that isolated ranch. [You know what will soon happen.] Bodies begin to fall again. There is a violent struggle. [Like some wrestling show.] The good guys win in the end.

This lower-budget movie has a poor script or direction. It must be the worst movie of the year. Don't say you weren't warned. But your opinion may vary.",1336176000,,1773,4.5

Other people have reviewed this film so I won't go into the plot. It's not a bad waste of time but it is if you are watching Synergy's dvd presentation which looks like little more than a VHS-dvd transfer -- either that or their equipment is awful! Let's hope some company like Code Red or Kino Lorber end up with the rights. I would avoid this version.",1430352000,,570,4.438095238095238

8379521,1,B000YQT7R2,"""Trained to Kill USA"" is a terrible 1973 movie that seeks to combine racial tensions, an evil biker gang, and bad wartime flashbacks into a steamy cauldron of action. Instead, it's just a mess that jumps from subplot to subplot. The prime mover here is an evil biker and part time carnival worker (a carny biker?!) who is in an interracial relationship (remember this movie was made when that was much less accepted situation that today, and is nothing but a grab at the exploitation angle.) Despite being a biker, by the way, the chief mode of transport here is an old hearse (ooh...symbolism runs deep!) He leads his gang in terrible adventures (abduction and attempted rape open the film, camper theft, bank robbery, and murder come later,) and his followers aren't exactly the brightest bulbs and often fail to intimidate (it's hard to intimidate wearing an argyle tam o'shanter.)

The thugs kill a nerd in yet another tam (this one is orange) in a plot to steal his camper, and things get serious. When the bikers break in to steal the Vietnam vet's guns, things go south fast. The vet really doesn't want to take up arms after the terrors of the war, but finds he has to. The remainder is entirely predictable. The script and story are awful, the acting is amateurish, and the music is pervasive and atrocious (just listen to the lyrics of the theme song!) Starring Stephen Sandor, Rockne Tarkington, and Richard X. Slattery, ""Trained to Kill USA"" is an awful early 1970s exploitation piece that attempts to use every hackneyed plotline from the era, but is really just a collection of caricatures in a tepid cauldron of cheese.",1395446400,,1634,4.753521126760563
