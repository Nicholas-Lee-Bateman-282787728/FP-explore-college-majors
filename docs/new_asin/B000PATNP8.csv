2814927,5,B000PATNP8,"Being a collector of third reich militaria, i'm always interested in seeing landmarks, political photos and the artifacts that came from the era. This set of videos captured my interest in just about every way. Especially enjoyable looking at the before and after photos of famous landmarks such as the feldhernhalle, nuremberg stadium and some austrian landmarks. If you have ever watched triumph of the will, you will really appreciate some of the footage in this, and upon seeing nuremberg stadium, picturing a million plus people in attendance to hear hitler speak at a rally. Also has footage of the temples of honour, and state buildings with the great neoclassical design hitler so loved. I won't spoil the rest for you. If you love third reich history, you really would appreciate this. I might just take a trip to germany after seeing this and get a closer look at these landmarks! Thats a little ways off, mayby one day soon! enjoy.",1234915200,2,942,4.857142857142857
2814928,5,B000PATNP8,"I have to admit I had no idea what to expect when I put the film in my DVD player. I have seen quite a few historical documentaries - some good, some bad. However you don't see many films with such detailed and unique footage. I felt like I was watching rare clips of Hitler that I was not supposed to be seeing. The narration is very easy to follow and the imagery enhances it to the point where I was completely engaged. I was fascinated by the pictures and footage of Germany both now and then. Well done!",1232323200,4,508,4.141414141414141
2814929,5,B000PATNP8,"I received ""Ruin of the Reich"" as a Christmas present this year.  And if you are thinking, a World War II documentary for Christmas,  well it's not that strange.  As a screenwriter and filmmaker myself, I've begun researching my next script which takes place during Germany's march through Europe. The wealth of information that I received from this DVD was incredible.  ""Ruins of the Reich"" is a two disc documentary that looks at the rise and fall of the Hitler and the Nazi party.  ""Ruins"" takes a look at this period in history from the unique angle of the buildings and forts that were constructed and used by the Germans in the late 30's and 40's.  This aspect of the DVD was extremely compelling for me.  As a contractor's son,  I enjoy architecture very much.  Although the Neo-Nazi style was very boxy and boring.  The intrigue came with my realization of how very precise and thought out Hitler was in everything he did, because each element  was working together to reach his ultimate vision.  And we all know where that took the world.

So in getting down to the particulars of the this DVD series, I found that the specific timeline from the beginning of Hitler's reign to the end of WWII are outlined with extreme detail and accuracy.  And to me that is the most important thing in a documentary.  Other ""likes"" I had with this series was that it brought you to the exact location of historic places in order to show you what it looks like today.  And since I haven't had the pleasure of traveling to Europe it was a treat.  I can't say this documentary is perfect by any means.  For me it fell short with the music.  There is not a lot of music throughout, it is really only used to punch up certain areas, in order to  draw attention or create subtle suspense during particular story lines.  Now the music may just be a side affect of my other problem with this DVD.  The entire film is voice over, and although the man speaking is eloquent and interesting, listening to anyone speak for 240 minutes wears on you.  So I would suggest breaking up the segments and watching them one at a time.  Each segment is an hour.  To help this problem, the director in me, would have liked to see a few interview of people with first, or at very least, second hand knowledge of the topics discussed.  I think it would have brought a slight human element to the film and broken up the constant voice over.  Now don't get me wrong, I am not in favor of a documentary filled with talking heads.

Finally I'd like to express my absolute favorite part of this film, the element that tips the scale from I liked it (four stars) to I loved it (five stars).  The archival footage used was amazing.  It is crystal clear, and in some cases better quality then the new footage.  It has got to be the real Nazi propaganda footage, I mean straight from the can.  There are clips of Hitler's home movies, clips from inside the Nazi headquarters, and even shots of people getting on a off trains heading for concentration camps.  I was completely blown away by this footage.  I know there aren't many documentaries out there with archival footage of this quality and that is why this DVD series is one of the best I've seen.  I hear that Shannon & Company have volumes 3 and 4 coming out soon and I will make sure to pick it up when I get the chance.  Nice job Mr. Adams.",1230508800,14,3360,4.415309446254072

Wow is the first word that comes to mind.  This series has the most interesting footage I have ever seen.  It's as if it was taken, and put in a time capsule that was perfectly preserved.  Each part more interesting then the next.  Really, I am stunned at the detail.  BRAVO!!!",1227398400,3,431,6.344827586206897
2814932,5,B000PATNP8,"This film provides an in depth look at the Nazi regime. As the history is narrated, wonderful shots of various structures and monuments are shown. ""Ruins of the Reich"" combines past footage from the days of Nazi Germany along with new film of how the buildings look today. Before viewing this film, I had never seen many of the sites that RJ Adams was able to uncover. Watching was a great way to learn more about this fascinating time in history. The grade of this film is top quality and I HIGHLY recommend it for everyone! Intriguing facts and stories are sure to keep your interest throughout!",1196294400,47,597,4.588785046728972
2814933,5,B000PATNP8,"A few months ago I bought another title from this producer and was very pleased with the quality and historical value of the program. ""Ruins of the Reich"" is nothing short of incredible. As a history major myself, I can tell you that the dedication to historical fact separates this filmmaker from the rest. I highly recommend anything RJ Adams comes out with. You won't be dissapointed!!!",1190592000,28,389,4.82089552238806
2814934,5,B000PATNP8,"Finally! The entire series on DVD. I first bought the VHS collection of the ""Ruins"" series a few years ago and played it so many times it became gull of creases and ripples. So naturally when I discovered that the complete had been released on DVD I was thrilled. It is of my opinion that the people producing this series should be commended for the Historical facts which are presented in a most informative and fascinating way. This is more than just an historical collection. It could well be a text for academic reviews at the highest level.",1176854400,34,545,4.571428571428571
2814975,4,B000PATNP8,"A British video made in around 2007.  It does give you a flavor of what could have been in Hitler's Germany if only evil did not so over come Hitler and the other five.  In that the US is incapable of making good and solid historical documentaries, too much baggage and personal opinion, the British did a good job here.",1397001600,,320,4.316666666666666
2814976,1,B000PATNP8,If I had known it wasn't closed captioned I would not have bought it & the contents weren't all that impressive either.,1393891200,,119,4.454545454545454
2814977,2,B000PATNP8,"Very poorly done, and the picture quality was simply awful. Nothing else to add other than feel really disappointed in the dvd.",1382400000,,127,4.818181818181818
2814978,1,B000PATNP8,"The program on these two discs was OK in content but the discs themselves were defective. The first order was found to
 have been packed inadequately and one disc was off the package spindle and the playing surface damaged. However even
 the other disc would not play properly on any of FIVE high quality DVD players that I have. I returned those dics and opted
 for another set--that was a mistake because the second was undamaged physically but again neither of the two discs
 would play properly. These are obviously cheaply recorded copies and that's a shame because the program itself is
 probably worth watching.",1361232000,2,618,4.847619047619047
2814979,4,B000PATNP8,"Ruins Of The Reich is a serious documentary about the architecture of the Reich, produced with a modest budget. That should not dissuade the viewer however, since the information and coverage is quite distinct within the pantheon of media. I like the format. Very clear, precise... it seems the producers let history do the talking, no hyperbole, no gimmicks, no theatrics beyond that of the past. And good/crisp video quality too; seems like a great deal of the footage is unfamiliar, yet of extreme interest.

The only real caveat would be the slightly 'dodgy' audio. At times a low level of noise accompanies the narrator.

This series (two discs, four episodes) also covers, in chronological order, a number of topics not quite explored sufficiently in most other WWII documentaries, architecture notwithstanding. This depth of research comes through time & again.

Recommended.",1334102400,,882,5.24113475177305
2814980,4,B000PATNP8,"The Ruins of the Reich two DVD (4 episode) set provides a very interesting overview of some of the remnants of what was to have been Hitler's 1000 year Reich. Both the footage and accompanying commentary provide a good introduction to the topic but lack some detail and substance. Some key sites that would add context and compliment the existing material are omitted, for example; the Museum Berlin-Karlhorst (Berlin) where the surrender of the German armed forces took place on the 8th May 1945. No mention is made of Sachsenhausen Memorial and Museum, Oranienburg nor of the Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz, both key sites in Berlin. The episode dealing with the occupied territories is excellent, particularly the part dealing with the occupation of (the then)Czechoslovakia and assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. Overall, a fascinating look at an important part of 20th Century History.",1290816000,,887,5.297872340425532
2814981,5,B000PATNP8,"This film should be in every school and university! The history along with the rare footage is extremely accurate. In addition there are some new insights I've gained while watching this documentary, such as: the immense details of times, dates and names of the varies German infantry divisions as they marched into Paris.
The recount of events both unequivocal and visually is phenomenal! Also, I am impressed by the rich tones and clarity of the narration, he draws me into the film, enriching the entire viewing experience.
I am more than ecstatic to have the `Ruins of the Reich' in my DVD library. Anyone who has the desire to be enlightened by true and precise information, beautifully formatted with never before seen footage should own this collection.
Another exceptional production, that focuses on the NSDAP's, by the same producers is: `Order Castles'. You will not be disappointed by the authenticity and the artistry of either one of these productions.",1265068800,8,966,5.081761006289308
2814982,3,B000PATNP8,"I lived in Germany for many years, studied German at a German university and was stationed at the SS Baracks next to the party parade grounds in Nuremberg.

First - the good news.  Much of the film footage the author(s) selected is great and rarely seen in its entirety.  Most of the dialog is factually accurate.

However -

The narrator has no command of German.  The decision to have him try to pronounce German and French terms and expressions is a disaster and it is extremely distracting.  Most of the time, I could hardly tell what he was saying, and I speak German well.  It would have been better to translate these terms into English, or find a German narrator.  The French is equally bad.

While the dialog is factually accurate, the narrator makes many statements that are gross generalizations and would lead the ordinary viewer with only a cursory knowledge of this subject to incorrect conclusions.  The people who made this film have only superficial knowledge of the art and architecture of Germany between 1933-1945.  There are many glaring omissions.  When they drift off to the West Wall and begin to focus on bunkers, it is over for me.  There is nothing uniquely German or National Socialist about pillboxes.  Military architecture is pretty generic.  Why was the Maginot line included?  It was built by the French.

I purchased this because of the consistantly high ratings it received, and I am disappointed.  Fortunately, I am able to watch German documentaries produced by historians, not amature history buffs.  I will source my future purchases from Amazon.de.",1262995200,19,1588,4.920754716981132
2814983,5,B000PATNP8,"I am both a history and a WW2 buff.  After reading the reviews on this DVD I decided to see what all the hoopla was about.  WOW!  What a fascinating and amazing video!!  I have to force myself away from the TV in order to get some sleep.  Such amazing footage and great narration that gives so many details on what you're looking at.  This is a must have for any history buff...and should be in every library.  The narration is very unbiased in it's view of the Nazis, and just tells the history as it happened.",1244764800,5,511,4.206185567010309
2814984,5,B000PATNP8,Great film about the Third Reich in terms of its buildings and architecture. The Germans loved structure and beauty. Everything about the Third Reich was significant. We learn a lesson from history.,1241827200,2,198,5.21875
8190173,5,B000PATNP8,"Bunkers, Tannenberg Memorial, and other relics of the Third Reich.

This is a pretty good dvd set. Each takes you to a time of the Third Reich and shares the actual building as it was if they have video or photos of it. Then it shows the actual ruins or what happened to it the present time. They also show relics and ruins from other countries built by the Third Reich and why is was build and what happened to it. There were some I had never heard of including some prisons. The Berghof was especially interesting. Holds the interest and I will be watching it again.",1524009600,,568,4.308411214953271
8190174,1,B000PATNP8,"This is definitely a (1) star review. I would say that 2% is actually relating to Ruins of the Reich. All these DVD's are, are a rehash of Germany and WWII that can be seen on the History Channel. Where are the RUINS???",1505952000,,219,4.116279069767442

8190178,4,B000PATNP8,"Although the introduction to the creation of the Reich is told at the beginning of the documentary ,I feel that anyone purchasing this DVD would not really need this information as this is more likely to be purchased by viewers whom already have a fairly well entrenched knowledge of this particular time in history .
However the segment on the Nuremburg Rally grounds was educational to me as although I had a good idea on how the lay out of the area was it did provide the missing pieces I needed to fully appreciate the huge area the rally grounds were spread over . The proposed Marsfeld would have been absolutely jaw dropping if it had been completed - unsurpassed even by any other field today .
The Hindenburg Tomb  was another facet of the Reich I was unfamiliar with and hadn't seen or heard too much about .
All in all I would recommend this DVD for viewing from a curiosity perspective as it is very interesting .",1422489600,,925,4.4733727810650885

8190181,3,B000PATNP8,"First of all, the DVDs are DVD-Rs, and, worse, with paper stick-on labels. I generally avoid commercial DVD-R releases, but I'll occasionally get one (and I need to know I'm getting a DVD-R BEFORE I order!). However, the quality is not even as good as the MOD DVDs from Warner Archive. There were major compression artifacts; video was close to VHS quality. The first set I got had two of the first disc, so I had to exchange for another set, which had both discs, but the paper label on one was torn.

The show, itself, is okay. It's the kind of older, no-budget independent documentary or travelogue video that you'd see during odd hours on PBS. Despite the title, only about half of the four hours is devoted to the architecture and ruins. The rest is split between thumbnail-sketch WWII history and a strange emphasis on memorials, which overwhelms the second half. The then-and-now footage is relatively brief, and consists mostly of static shots from a distance. I really wanted the camera to wander around and explore the ruins, but I was left unsatisfied. Some of it was very interesting, but those parts were brief. Very disappointing.",1401062400,2,1144,4.777777777777778
