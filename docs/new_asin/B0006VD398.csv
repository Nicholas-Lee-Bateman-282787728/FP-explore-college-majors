2196541,2,B0006VD398,That movie was poor in everyway.  So predictable and unrealistic.  And the music...it didn't even go with the theme or style of movie.  Don't waste your time or money.,1290211200,3,167,4.689655172413793
2196542,5,B0006VD398,"I was rather surprised by this movie. I usually am not the biggest fan of Romantic Comedies, but a friend of mine raved about this one, and the cinephile that I am, I decided to give it a shot. While it retained the feeling that no matter what happened, the romantic leads were inevitably going to end up together (I s'pose it's a romantic comedy, such things are inevitable), it managed to present this story in a very stylish way. Instead of confining the discussion to the romantic entaglements presented in the narratives, the film talked about things like the benefits and failings of routine.

Of course at times it descended into the schmaltz of love letters, utterances of 'I want to spend the rest of my life with you', and the like, but--as my female friends inform me--this is an essential element of the genre. And there were some wonderful moments of truth such as an awkward conversation about the weather that turn into embers of romance, or a moment of quiet delight when the female lead tests out an indicator of love (it's all in the fingertips). For me the hightlight of the movie was the paralellism that was presented between love and mermaids. And the direction and cinematography weren't subservient to the story: each element was allowed to explore the themes in its own way without being an illustration of the feelings of the characters. All in all, it never stopped being a Romantic Comedy, but all the while, it managed to side step insufferability.",1271289600,16,1477,4.724806201550388
2196543,3,B0006VD398,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I've not read the book this is based on, so can't compare the two.  The movie could've been a very sweet, funny look at love, but is marred by a couple of unneeded fairly graphic scenes (imagination is a wonderful thing), and an odd senile neighbor character I simply couldn't figure out the purpose for.  I think the creators of the film probably wanted it to have a quirky, almost fantasy feel to it, but didn't quite succeed.  The soundtrack/background music was completely annoying and had no relation to the characters or what was going on, and I found myself wishing there was an option to turn it off.  Bruce Greenwood's performance is what makes it watchable.  He turns a train wreck of a character into someone deeply appealing and charming, even though Tom is almost impossibly naive and gullible for a middle aged man.  Also in the spirit of full disclosure I LOVE his voice and wish he really did have a radio show as my dial would be permanently welded onto that station.",1267401600,15,1018,4.596685082872928

A terrific cast--including the too-little-known Bruce Greenwood (JFK in ""Thirteen Days"") and a real-life as well as onscreen father-daughter pair, James and Emilia Fox--gives us a terrific look at love.",1224374400,2,440,7.320754716981132
2196545,3,B0006VD398,"Film follows three couples: elderly couple who have spent their lives together without being married, couple that celebrates 40 years of marriage and a middle aged couple in a new relatioship on a crossroads of deciding if they want to get married or not.  We learn that relationships are never what they seem to be to the outsiders.  What seems to be perfect 40-year long relationship ends up in trial separation and what seems to be uncommited casual relationship ends up in marriage in a hospital death bed.  The young couple: a man who has been married and divorced three times and his girlfriend who never had seemingly strong relationship are trying to figure out if the marriage is for them at all.  There are some great British actors ogf the older generation in this movie: Edward Fox and Claire Bloom for example, who have aged so much that it is almost impossible to recognize them.  I liked the mystic indian music in the movie, but fresh infatuation between two youngest protagonists is too sappy at time.  I did find some of the casual sex scenes funny (foot fetish for example).",1212710400,3,1093,4.696335078534031
2196546,5,B0006VD398,"Adaptations are tough, they can never be completely faithful, but this film does well.  We own it and have seen it several times. Much more insight into human nature than a standard formula romance or romantic comedy.",1209600000,,217,4.864864864864865
2196547,4,B0006VD398,"THE REPUBLIC OF LOVE is yet another fine film from Canada based on Canadian Pulitzer Prize Winner (for 'The Stone Diaries') Carol Shields' novel by the same name, and written for the screen and directed by the gifted Deepa Mehta ('Earth', 'Fire', 'Water', etc). It is a satisfying story about the human boundaries set by/for love and how those 'republics' touch and clash and interact.

Tom Avery (the very gifted actor Bruce Greenwood) was an illegitimate child, raised by a homemaker class as a teaching lesson in how young brides to be should learn the skills of tending house, who has grown up, married three times out of a need for belonging and for being loved, and is currently unattached, making his living as a night talk show host helping the lonely hearts.  Into his life steps the beautiful museum curator, currently involved in a Mermaid Exhibition, by the name of Fay (Emilia Fox) who remains single because of her exceptionally high demands for a partner.  The two meet, fall immediately in love at first sight, much to their individual surprise, and proceed with a courtship, while at the same time encountering and observing other couples (especially their parents) who seem to hold the winning medals for perfect marriage.

Fay's parents (James Fox is Richard, the father) have just celebrated their anniversary when Richard abruptly decides to leave his wife.  Fay runs to her mother's rescue, leaving Tom alone and the apparent brunt of Fay's disillusion of marriage.  The changes that occur cause Tom to reflect on his history of marrying too often in unions that have not met with success. How Fay and Tom ultimately resolve the abutments of their personal 'republics' is the part of the story that carries the film.

The entire cast includes some of Canada's finest actors and the film is solidly directed by Mehta.  There are aspects that disrupt the flow of the story, the main one being the incessant and very loud East Indian music that seems wholly out of place and is at best distracting (the score was written by Talvin Singh).  Mehta also elects to throw in some bizarre cutesy animation at the end that for this viewer cheapens the story. But flaws aside, this is a fine film graced by the presence of Bruce Greenwood and Emilia Fox. Recommended entry from Film Movement.  Grady Harp, January 08",1200873600,15,2327,4.838790931989925
2196548,4,B0006VD398,"This is a very nice love story that is fairly conventional on one level (love at first sight) but has the more comfortable pacing and luminous imagery of independent films that makes it a bit more original. I hadn't read the novel to be able to make comparisons, but I can see how a lot probably had to be abbreviated. The two leads are excellent. Bruce Greenwood is one of my favorite actors, and it is only because he is so appealing that his character Tom (who has been married 3 times and impulsively falls in love and wants to marry immediately again) doesn't seem like the total suffocating mess he probably would be in real life, and actually seems like someone Fay could feel comfortable with. Also, this film has a woman director--big plus!",1189728000,3,749,4.555555555555555
2196549,3,B0006VD398,"I loved the book this was based upon, and had long hoped that someone would make a film of it, while realising that to capture the atmousphere the book had for me would be difficult. However, the film has caught the quirky charm of the book, and I thought it was well worth watching - the main actors suited the roles well - though seeing Amelia Fox in this setting was odd after her recent TV appearance. Subtlely different from the book but, as I have re-read the book several times, I am sure I will watch this again.",1162512000,3,520,4.262626262626263
2196550,5,B0006VD398,"I don't agree with any of the poor reviews. I absolutely loved this movie - the story line, characters, and all. The parts that seem 'slow' made the movie more true to life, and fit very well. I found myself wondering what was with the sepia color, but it fit in and at the right time, made me say ""AhHa!"". Sweet, romantic, sad, happy, heartwarming...  with a very good ending.",1359763200,,377,4.385714285714286
2196551,2,B0006VD398,"I thought this movie was freakishly awkward.  If you read all the negative reviews in this thread (prior to my post) I would have to say I agree pretty much with everything they say.  I don't know if the positive reviews are real or not (we all know that people tend to 'puff up' ratings on everything from products, food to movies....) however, with that said, I cannot agree more than all the negative reviews regarding the music not matching, the people not being believable, the feeling of being left cold at the end.  I'm sure some people like this type of movie.  I am not one of them.  My wife loves romantic comedies and she even thought this was weird.  I have to say that yes... this was freakishly weird in an uninteresting way...
  I recently saw 'the Devil wears Prada' and that was actually good and watchable.  This movie I would not recommend.  Not the worse but I would give it 1 1/2 stars if i could.",1357344000,,918,4.378698224852071
2196552,1,B0006VD398,"A lot was said about this movie at the time it came out, indicating it was a touching love story.  Been skeptical of the general downturn in the genre, with a lot of indications that they have no clue what that's all about. But, thought I'd try again.  But, true to form, it ran to the now standard poor taste with an unpleasant aftertaste.  For starters - the kinky Indian music was too strange. Maybe the mermaid idea was considered an artsy touch as well.

If the characters had been able to get over themselves, the viewer would have been able to breathe easier. The long looks - forget your lines? The oh-so-serious weighing of inner feelings about oneself, especially with Fay - grow up, kid. I think it's called analysis paralysis. Her brother had her number. Where does all that probative introspection get her? It's good she rallied around her mother when needed, but was it really necessary to spin into withdrawal? Lash out at Tom when he calls? She's a baby.  Someone really should have taken Tom's temperature. I think he was sick or was he just sleep walking? Just kind of drifts into things, including marriage. Use the brain. Get a pulse. Now, put the two together.

These are supposed to be adult people who hold down real jobs. Their courtship and relating revolve mainly around the initial newness of meeting and cohabiting. Pretty flimsy deal they got going here. Not surprising that it doesn't weather the first ill wind that blows its way. I guess their parents failed them along the way, but what else is new? You are supposed to acquire some life skills beyond that on your own. You're grown up now (40ish, in his case), so why can't you handle anything? Where's the strength for someone else? Consumed on little me, actually. Good luck on the marriage (""I'm so happy!""). Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than that. Oh, please finally get with it, or just go back home and settle into sucking your thumbs in earnest.

This is a downer about two losers likely to remain that way.",1351814400,5,2004,4.612359550561798
2196553,1,B0006VD398,"This movies was rediculous. Thats all I have to say... I watch a lot of cheesy chick flick romance movies and this was the most akward, slow, weird romance that I have seen. Just weird!",1351728000,,185,4.314285714285714
2196554,5,B0006VD398,"I'm just cutting and pasting the review I wrote on Netflix.

Basically this is the best movie I've seen in years. It was flippin' awesome. How awesome was it? Flippin', that's how awesome it was. Basically I'm a man that doesn't believe in love, and this didn't make me believe in love or anything, but it sure was awesome. I very much enjoyed the DJ dude, he was so cool. And the babe, she was a fox. To be honest I was surprised at how much I liked this film. Very surprised. I don't even know why I watched it. It is by far definitely the best romantic movie I've ever seen in my life. Like I said, I don't believe in love, and so for all those guys that think most romantic stories are hokey, you might actually like this film. I guess the description caught my attention. ""He's a thrice divorced talk show host, susceptible to jumping into love."" I liked the sound of that. A man who knows what he wants, goes for it, and then puts up with the consequences. Yeah, this movie was awesome. Lots of cool things happen.",1337904000,,1020,4.257731958762887
2196555,4,B0006VD398,"This is no great film making, but it's a sweet, simple romance.  Yes, it relies at times on cheap tricks, but the acting is solid, the dialogue is true and the story unfolds nicely.  I never read the book, so I can't compare.  If you like romantic films, give this one a shot.  I both smiled and cried, which is all I really ask from this genre.  And in the end, I was happy with the way things worked out for everyone.",1325030400,,419,4.060975609756097
2196556,5,B0006VD398,"I thought this was a lovely film and it really was a joy and pleasure to watch.  It benefitted from good direction and acting - it was sweet, but not too sweet to be overbearing and cheesy like most other romantic comedies.  I very much enjoyed it.",1307923200,2,248,4.25531914893617
2196557,3,B0006VD398,"To begin with, I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  I rented it because the reviews seemed favorable and the price was right.  I think that while the characters were likable, at the core there was no soul.  Perhaps it was the winter scenes of Canada but the movie left me cold.  Or perhaps it was a by-product of the cinematography.  There was a lack of warmth until near the very end of the movie.  The female lead's discussions of love with her father struck me as analytical and sterile.  It was as if they were discussing intimate relationships at arms length.  This was at odds with the intimate scenes in the bedroom and other places that were best left to the imagination.  Perhaps it was the scripted reserve of the characters, but I think there was a lot left unsaid.  Love prevailed in the end, I don't think we really know why.",1296345600,4,848,4.412903225806452
2196558,2,B0006VD398,"This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's very forgettable.  Being that this is story based on love, you need to buy into & believe in the love that is being portrayed.  You want to connect with the characters & cheer them on.  I couldn't have cared less about their love story.  I didn't buy into it.  I was totally uninterested in it.  It was bleh.  I wasn't drawn into their story at all.",1294358400,2,401,4.197368421052632

8043589,5,B0006VD398,"This is a sweet, campy, sometimes silly, very very human story about the experience of accidentally finding mystical love after many failures along the road to happiness.  One of the things I loved about it is that it is far from the usual 'hollywood' generated fare.

Great characters, 'real' families, human flaws and a look at the experience of love at first sight.  Not sappy just happily quirky, LOVED IT.  Bought the DVD and I NEVER do that!",1392422400,,447,4.6923076923076925
8043590,5,B0006VD398,"I love the bits that the negative reviewers either didn't get or care for. To me, the discrepancy in opinions is in part because the movie is Canadian, a number of the supporting cast are British, and the director is of Indian ethnicity - which makes this romantic comedy ""foreign"" for Americans. Frankly, it was those foreign elements that I loved. To me, the director's choice of Indian music was happily atypical because it was unexpected, fit the scenes it was in and added a sense of fun. The leads clicked with each other and made a believable couple with dignity as well as quirks. The humor is not low-brow and the acting is across-the-board intelligent. Greenwood is excellent as usual and looks fantastic. As for the reviewer who said the movie is not ""clean"" that reflects a very conservative standard. There are humorous sexual situations (including one I found hysterical), but absolutely no nudity and the scenes are shot tastefully. There is a lot that is funny in this film and if it doesn't say something profound, it does say something sweet about love, risk, commitment, and enchantment. Most would find this a sweet Valentine's Day diversion.",1392163200,2,1162,4.873737373737374
