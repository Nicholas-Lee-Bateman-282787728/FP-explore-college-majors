8374958,4,B002NC4DLA,"EASTWEST slimcased DVD double features offer two films on one disc side, with no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on the case's back cover. Their space-saver two-fers provide a nice variety of lesser-known films for bargain prices.

BLUNT is a season 3 episode of the long-running BBC TV program, ""Screen Two,"" an anthology series of 90-minute films. GUILTY CONSCIENCE (correct name for ""The Murder Man"") is another made-for-TVer, but an American one.

In the first, Ian Richardson portrays Anthony Blunt. He was arrested in 1951 and charged with being the British contact for a Soviet mole stationed at Her Majesty's Washington D.C. embassy. Anthony Hopkins is Guy Burgess, a fellow counter intelligence operative who helps their spy in America to safely reach the U.S.S.R.

Hopkins stars in GUILTY CONSCIENCE as a criminal attorney contemplating divorce who'd rather kill his wife than pay alimony. He carefully works out in his mind different murder scenarios and using an imaginary lawyer counterpart calculates how each courtroom trial would play to the residing judge (his father's portrait) and how they'd conclude. Throughout all these mental gymnastics, the would-be assassin doesn't know that his wife is considering how to bump HIM off! A delicious screenplay is by the creators of the Peter Falk crime drama series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COLUMBO/dp/B0002COTDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COLUMBO</a>.
