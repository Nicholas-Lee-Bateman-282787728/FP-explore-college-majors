3728987,5,B001O5CLXY,"This segment clearly displays the human cost of drunk driving and should be used as one powerful video against people who decide to drive under the influence. Is it murder? If you are a family member of someone killed by DUI, you would definitely agree that DUI is murder when a rational person shows little or no regard for other people on the road. I knew people who were killed by drunk drivers and I will always consider their deaths murder.",1238284800,13,445,4.506172839506172

8329695,5,B001O5CLXY,"I'm a drug counselor working full time in a high school with kids and part time in a clinic with adults both on Long Island.  I use this dvd often to provoke interesting discussions about alcohol and DWIs.  It appeals to all ages.
This 60 Minutes episode deals with a notorious accident that took place on a well known parkway on Long Island in 2005. It involved a young man in a pick up truck driving a couple of miles the wrong way into traffic and finally colliding with a limousine that was bringing a family home from a wedding - instantly killing the limo driver and beheading an adorable 7 year old who was a flower girl at her aunt's wedding.
What makes it especially powerful is that the viewer sees the actual accident happening. There was a video camera in the front windshield of the limo - and as the grandparents of the little girl are describing the accident, the viewer gets to see this light coming toward the limo that turns into two lights and quickly rams into them.
We get to hear from the DA prosecuting the case - and from the young man's attorney. This dvd engages kids and adults alike in the discussion of what type of sentence is appropriate for DWIs where one or more people are killed. It incites thought about whether or not steeper penalties would deter drunk driving and whether or not the crime can be considered murder.",1386633600,5,1353,4.451612903225806
