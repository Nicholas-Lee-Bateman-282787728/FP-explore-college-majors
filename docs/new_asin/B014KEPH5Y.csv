7413986,5,B014KEPH5Y,"I first got to see this back in January for the first time and so I wanted to see it again, and re-view it again because now it is out on DVD. This is a must own DVD of a brilliant documentary that I highly recommended in my original review, and now once again, I continue to highly recommend it as it is on DVD..

Director Michele Josue a close friend to Matthew, has lovingly created a true testament of the heart and soul. She gives an outlet to express a peaceful, and beautiful image of a loving man, and the horrible means, and hatred that took his life.

This is one case that has always haunted me. It's a case that created an emotional ordeal inside me even to this day when I hear his name. I remember hearing the news when they found him. I remember when it happened, going through the whole process of the news, the haters screaming, and the court room trial. The images of the grieving parents. The moments of Matthews crying mother.

To be honest at first I had a huge lump in the back of my throat in knowing that this documentary was available for me to view. I contemplated not viewing it and not reviewing it because it's such an emotional tear-jerking reality inside me. Thankfully I made myself view this film. This was a film that gave an outlet to this beautiful man that was Matthew Shepard.

I am glad I experienced this masterpiece documentary of a young man's life, and what his death showcased, and the reality of a true stain of hatred. Hate is such a horrible word, and a horrible reality that sadly still exist in this day and age, and is a shocking reality in the news more often every day. Everyone should have the right to be who they are, to love who they wish, as long as they are not hurting anyone else. Matthew was a peaceful individual. A beautiful boy, man, soul, that transcended to this generation because of the horrible means of his murder. So many experienced the heart ache right along with the Shepards. To see Judy Shepard's tears. To see a crying mother morn her broken, bruised and slaughtered son is an image I will never forget.

I highly recommend this film of truth. The film shines for the love of a fallen angel, and amazing soul. It's showcased in a way that it stands out, and means something that should, and will be remembered. A true powerhouse at creating emotions, and imagery that's touches the heartstrings.

Brilliant at creating a piece of film, to be remembered.

I found it to be a vivid exploration of Matthewss life, and the aftermath. No matter how many years after the ordeal, the friends, and family, and even total strangers, know that this horrible deed, happened. There are good days, and there are bad days, and there are worst days for those involved. But what makes this case so different, is we the public became a part of this young mans life, and horrible end. I like so many others never knew Matthew in life, but it was his tragic murder that brought so many to his life, reality, and peaceful being.

I, like so many others felt attached to him. I felt love for him, and his family without ever meeting him. His tragedy transcended the awfulness of the crime. It was as if the death of Matthew took a piece of so many of us across the world. He became a brother, a family member, and we all lost him, yet gained his truth. We must learn from the horror brought upon this beautiful man. We must teach that hate is the ultimate Nazi in history.

An important, relevant, touching experience. A documentary that's personal. That's passionate. That cares. That expresses the love of Matthew, and the horror that was done upon him. Hate is such a powerful word, such a powerful idea, such a descriptive term. It's a word that should have no meaning, or bearing in this culture, yet it controls, yet it punishes, and yet it takes away. We are supposed to be, a civilized people. Hate is not part of being civilized. Hate must stop. The hatred, the bitterness, the evil took Matthew Shepard. He was taken by that hatred, that evil that so many innocent others have been taken by.

To me this is a must see. A moving experience that shines on the craftsmanship of creating brilliant, memorable pieces of documentary cinema.

Now you can own this on DVD. Michele Josue made an excellent documentary that lingers with you, and lets you experience never before seen photos, rare video footage, and emotions, that this case was about. A perfect documentary that should be seen at all cost. A wonderful tribute to Matthew's memory. Michele Josue gave a gift to Matthews family, friends, and even to strangers like myself in creating this perfect film.",1447977600,2,4623,4.504773269689737
7413987,5,B014KEPH5Y,"What happened to Matt should always be a reminder that hate crimes will not be tolerated.  Matt was a beautiful soul who fell victim to people in this world who will not accept different than they are or believe.  I am not sure this kind of hate will ever not be here but, it is a reminder that love will always out weigh hate.  I recommend this story to be seen by young people to let them know it is them who can make the choice to be one of the people who will never tolerate this kind of hate.",1447286400,2,497,3.95

7413989,5,B014KEPH5Y,"I just finished watching the above documentary and it was compelling, heartbreaking, and informative. There are lots of interviews from some of the people who knew Matt, i.e., his parents, friends, teachers, reverend, bartender (from the night he was killed), and the police officers that handled his case. There are rare footage and pictures of Matt and his family. It's nice to see that his parents were part of the making of the documentary because when I read Judy Shepard's book titled The Meaning of Matthew, I discovered that she didn't approve of The Matthew Shepard Story 'cause certain parts were inaccurate. It's not everyone that is capable of forgiving such heinous crimes and this is understandable, but his parents did. I hope to follow in their footsteps. The only thing I didn't like about the documentary was when Bill Clinton was shown making speeches, but as heartless as he was in his treatment of the Rwandan genocide, he may have been the president at the time so this makes sense. President Obama was shown signing the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Everyone should watch this. I highly recommend to all.",1447200000,,1160,4.923469387755102

7413993,5,B014KEPH5Y,"Heart-wrenching and touching, and so vital to the expansion of equal rights for all humans. This was very difficult at times for me to watch (not in a graphic sense) because of how heartbreaking it was for me to see the person that Matthew Shepard was and the beauty and love he exuded. There were no details about Matthew's death (for which I am thankful)  other than the cursory explanations provided by the media at the time. However, there is an in depth exploration of Matthew's life and relationships and the despicable events the night of his death. i am so grateful for creating a safe-haven for everyone who feels different.",1478044800,,633,4.702702702702703

7413996,5,B014KEPH5Y,"Matthew Shepard represents many things to many different people. For some he stands as a symbol of why people need to fight for equality, for others he opened their eyes to the horror and abuses that people go through every day simply for being different. What's easy to forget however, is that first and foremost, Matthew Shepard was a human being. Shepard was a friendly, kind, outgoing, young man from a small town and there in lied the problem. In a town of a few thousand, Shepard stood out and everyone knew who he was and what he was. One night, a couple of drunk rednecks decided to mess with him, it went too far, and they killed him. This film, isn't about that though, it isn't one of the many films about the symbol that Shepard became or the fight for equal rights his story ignited. This is a film, by a long time friend of Matt's, who simply wanted the world to know about her friend. Michele Josue interviews Matt's brokenhearted family and friends about his life, from childhood up until his untimely death, and weather your gay or not, weather you respect gay rights or not, you can't help but feel for these people who lost such a bright, loving, artistic person, who made everyone around him just that much better for knowing him. It's a terrific documentary and I was very happy that for once, a documentary focused on the life of the man instead of the tragic way that he was killed.",1466640000,,1405,4.470817120622568
7413997,5,B014KEPH5Y,"I watched this documentary tonight; the creation of his friend, Michele Jusue, who hoped to use interviews with family members and friends to humanise the gentle human being they knew while acknowleging the symbol he became on the night of October 6, 1998. She succeeds on both counts but by far the most compelling moments occur in the last fifteen minutes during her interview with Father Roger Schmit who not only officiated at Matt's funeral but speaks of visiting one of his murderers in prison. His frankness and empathy opens a door to another reason for her to make the documentary, and in doing so, changes its focus.
 Released in 2014, I found this quote from a college friend very compelling in light of recent events:
 ""There was some much emotion just pouring around the world; so much fear and so much outrage and mixed in with that in the gay community the was so much hope that as awful as this was, would this be the one that would make policy makers care. Would be the one that would reach homophobes around the country and wake them up. I think that everyone out there hoped that maybe this was going to be it; this is the moment when we show people that rhetoric and bias against gay people has an impact. An impact we don't want. And an impact we have the power to stop.""",1466380800,3,1292,4.470338983050848

7414001,4,B014KEPH5Y,"I just watched this on Netflix, and I have mixed feelings about it. His attack in 1998 struck a nerve with me then and still does now, esp, when I hear about parents rejecting their gay or lesbian kids, regardless of their so-called justification) to me there is no valid excuse. I'm glad his attack was implied, but the aftermath photos were heart breaking, and was also glad to get a real picture of what Matt was like, and guess what, my love and respect hasn't changed at all! In fact, it's increased immensely, because now I have a glimpse of the real Matt that the media didn't show, even though, I know some of it may have been hyped somewhat. Having said that, I do wish some rebuttal would've been made about the Hidden Truths book, which oddly enough some readers still want to take as gospel, I would've preferred Hidden Theories myself, because certain claims may have some truths, but homophobia still makes sense to me, because, the attack was just far too brutally cruel not to have hate motivation somewhere, I still feel connected to him, like I knew him, and would've loved to know him as a person. I may never forget what happened to him, but for what is was, I got a better glimpse of the real Matt, even though the other two movies are still good, which I do own, but this one, I'm not sure about...yet",1450310400,,1323,4.426229508196721

This and ""The Laramie Project"" go well together giving a greater picture of what was left out of the movie, ""The Matthew Shepard Story.""  I would recommend all three.",1494115200,,432,4.8108108108108105

Ive kept up with things. . . . off-and-on. . . though the years.  So tragic.  This film gives a little more information about his friends, and their feelings.  Its certainly beyond a home movie, but still has that feel, in a way.  I liked it. . . but I didn't love it. So Im still willing to give it four-stars.  I was in hopes to hear something from his brother, but that didn't happen. But overall, its certainly worth watching.",1485820800,,548,4.211538461538462

I remember when this all happened in 1998, and I couldn't even watch it on TV at the time.  It's been 18 years since then, and I decided to watch this documentary.  Some of it, I still couldn't watch (because it was too upsetting), but after watching this documentary, I feel like I know Matthew Shepard, not just as a catalyst for change, but as a person.  I highly recommend this documentary.",1484265600,,510,4.326315789473684
8731092,5,B014KEPH5Y,"A Heartwarming & Brilliant Film - A Tribute to the Life of Matt Shepard

This film leaves me no doubt that Matt is smiling down from Heaven on the legacy his life left behind.  A tremendously emotional story that weaves together the stories of friends and family so that all might learn what a gentle and kind life Matt lived. The story includes rare home video and photographs of Matt's life, told by the people that loved him and were part of his short life.

The filmmakers tell the entire story of Matt's life from his humble upbringing in Wyoming, to his worldwide life after his family moved to Saudi Arabia and his attending a boarding school in Switzerland. And continuing with his return to the United States, and the struggles he faced coming out as a young gay man before eventually transferring to the University of Wyoming in 1998.  While much of the film is emotional, the horrific ending of his life is particular difficult and sad to watch (keep tissues in reach).

Remarkable words from Father Schmit are a message to every human being, and the family decision to not pursue the death penalty of the murderers is beyond compelling.  This is too powerful a segment that cannot be missed.

Simply put, this is a must see documentary film about family, friends and forgiveness.  And about ending hate and about finding a way to heal and to love.  Matthew would be proud and this film is proof his soul is alive on Earth as it is in Heaven.",1483747200,,1453,4.5576923076923075
