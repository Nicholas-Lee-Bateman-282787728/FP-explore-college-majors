984946,1,6305203601,"Couldn't make it through this one - I don't recommend it.  If you are a Brad Pitt Fan, you will be disappointed.",1361404800,,112,4.090909090909091
984947,1,6305203601,"Don't watch this movie just because Brad Pitt is in it he looks better later in life. This is a waste of time watching this film it is boring no plot no nothing, just a waste of  film. Don't waste your time it is a really an awful movie!",1360972800,,237,3.836734693877551
984948,3,6305203601,Dark Side of the Sun featuring the young Pitt is OK. I much prefer his later work like Benjamin Button.,1360454400,,103,4.2
984949,5,6305203601,"I am not much of a Brad Pitt fan but I will have to admit I was very supprised by his performance in this movie.

He showed talent & depth I had not prevoiusly given him credit for.

For this role he spent half of his time completely covered in black leather with every part of his body hidden.

There is no way anybody can accuse him of coasting by on his looks in this movie.

I highly recommend this film based on Mr. Pitt's performance.",1292716800,,440,4.0813953488372094
984950,5,6305203601,My son is a huge Brad Pitt fan.  Awesome to be able to find another movie to add to his collection.  Arrived before Christmas.,1230422400,,126,4.208333333333333
984951,5,6305203601,"It was five years ago that I remember watching most of this movie at 2 in the morning. I didn't know the name of the actors nor anything else about the movie (never heard of Brad Pitt yet) but the memory of watching this film was very profound. I have been trying to find it for a long time. I cried myself to sleep at the end because this film invokes an emotion I can't even express. I just loved it...the message, the courage, the location and the sadness. To quote the Thornbirds ""true love is only bought at the cost of great pain."" I was quite sick as a child and I had a friend that died of a rare skin disease similar to the film. I understand that in suffering is a kind of beauty and this movie invokes that hauntingly fragile sentiment of loss. I was taught that the Son of God rose on the third day and I believe that this son did too because he chose to live in the light of the sun. This is a beautiful movie worth watching. Hope this helps potential viewers. Love and Peace all.",1197158400,2,993,4.097435897435897
984952,5,6305203601,"Maybe if you are looking for freedom or you are fighting for your love, you have to seen this film. You'll listen in this film a song that sings ""Listen to the moon crying, touching our hearts with her face, listen to me oh! my darling, cause this will be my end...if may words had hurt you, I'll trouble you no more, In the outstand of the morning I'll reach a distance shore... yesterday is mine, tomorrow time its almost too, whatever I've been through is all just thanks to you""",983145600,3,482,4.3076923076923075
984953,4,6305203601,"What the film lacks in ""esoteric film quality"" is compensated by the special interest content. If you like the Mad Max trilogy (Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome) and you like  motorcycling, especially dual-sport motorcycling (on-road & off-road),  then you will love this film. The motorcycle ridden by the main character in  this film is a Kawasaki KLR650, which happens to be my favorite bike of all  time.  In the 2000 model buyer's guide in the March 2000 issue of the  Motorcyclist magazine, the Kawasaki KLR650 is described as:  ""When  asked to choose just one motorcycle to live with for the rest of our lives,  many of us pick Kawasaki's KLR650.  This may be the most versatile  motorcycle on the planet.""Actually when watching the movie, one has to  wonder if Kawasaki was the sole sponsor.",950313600,3,830,4.85
984954,4,6305203601,"I must say, Brad had it all along--charisma, personality, style, innocence, and talent.  I'm from the state of Missouri and I can say that everyone there is very proud of Pitt's accomplishments.  In this short  elusive film via 1980's, Pitt proves that he is ready to take on Hollywood  and the world by storm.  He seems to me to have a strong sense of who he is  and what he wants to accomplish in his life and career.  The four star  rating for me was for the wall to wall classical music that becomes just a  little too annoying.  I love Bach, but come on!!!",919296000,,561,4.257142857142857
985042,1,6305203601,WORST MOVIE I EVER WATCHED! Couldn't wait for it to end! The editing was so bad that the storyline didn't make any sense. Cheryl Pollack's acting was stiff and flat; Brad Pitt's acting wasn't much better. C.Pollack's singing was WORSE than her acting! Don't waste your time with this disaster!,1412812800,,293,4.88
985043,4,6305203601,Great movie,1410566400,,11,5.0
985044,1,6305203601,This is a bad bad low budget film.  You have to be Pitt desperate to watch more than 5 minutes,1409788800,,94,3.7
985045,4,6305203601,A very interesting movie. I felt sorry for the the people who actually have this desease if there is one. Very good.,1404259200,,116,4.318181818181818
985046,1,6305203601,"Absolutely terrible movie.  At least it was relatively short.  I watched the whole thing, thinking it had to get better.  It didn't.",1403049600,,132,4.909090909090909
985047,1,6305203601,"I watched this because Brad Pitt was in it and I thought it had potential, despite the low ratings. Unfortunately it was truly a waste of my time. Despite it being a boring low-budget movie, there was barley any plot--just a waste of a movie!",1402012800,2,242,4.4
985048,3,6305203601,"This was part of one of those 8 films for $5 DVDs and was a nice romantic tragedy..filmed in the former Yugoslavia (Talk about a tragedy!)

The desperate dad was well acted, and young Pitt did a good job, even covered in a leather mask.

A few WTF moments, like the bum who is crushing unlit cigarettes with his shoe to quit smoking and then later crushing condoms. He is featured all too often in the movie and apparently represents something, but what?

And one on the beach scene, right before a motorcycle race, a female extra snaps off her bathing suite top and parades her ample bosom right in front of the camera lens.  Why?

The re-use of the same classical music gets a bit cloying and the whole thing is a bit like a made-for-cable Hallmark special. But it's OK, and not much more.",1400630400,,791,4.390410958904109
985049,3,6305203601,"Thank goodness that time provides actors an opportunity to star in films for experience, to use better technology, take acting lessons and and get a hold of superb scriptwriting because this one was really subpar.  However, I understand they have to start somewhere. This movie really was not super bad but time really puts its stamp on films. I collect Brad Pitt films so this was a first for me and I won't be watching it again because it is not that kind of movie you want to watch repeatedly, but I made it all the way though even while I was in bed sick. And it is short too-not like today's ridiculously long movies. However, it is interesting to see his technique at play now and back then.  I see common things that he does.",1395014400,,732,4.375
985050,1,6305203601,"The script was weak...a bit tiresome. The acting was awful except Brad Pitt's who at times didn't seem he was all there. It seemed like they were reading directly from a script and/or having a ""rehearsed"" conversation. There's so much more but I don't have the time.",1389398400,3,266,4.680851063829787
985051,4,6305203601,"That was kind of rude to the filmakers and other actors, but his face made me decide to read on. It says 1997 but as you can quickly see from the look of the tape it looks like an 80's afterschool special. Which if edited correctly would have been a spot on hit,even cult classic style. It was a nice film if you think back to that time, the films where 'hokey' and preachy and sad yet inspiring. Usually you would think about it for quite awhile after it was over. There were a few times i rolled my eyes so much i had a headache but then the film grabbed me once more to let it take me away and be guided on the journey they needed to tell us.  I probably will see it again and tell others about it. Maybe it will become a kind of cult? I hope so. This film and it's actors deserve it. I read about what it went through for us to finally see it in this finished state. Beautiful backdrop as well as beautiful young actors. I hope you give it a chance or a second chance. OH I was a bit confused about the mother? The father should be sainted with what he goes through. I know  that was random but needed to slip it in there.",1382745600,,1126,3.9559471365638768

7884828,1,6305203601,This movie is just awful. Only good thing about it is Brad Pitt but you don't even see his face half of the time.,1432080000,,113,3.75
7884829,3,6305203601,"Not much substance,",1429920000,,19,5.666666666666667
