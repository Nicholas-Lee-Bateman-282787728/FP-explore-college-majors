3796750,4,B001U6YIB0,"A 1957 film based on whether a Korean POW should be tried for treason based on the evidence known to the US army investigator (Richard Widmark) the movie structure reveals strongly its theatre play origins but is fascinating for a number of reasons:

1. The take on what constitutes treason based on how POWs were treated by North Korea was given its time of release at the height of the Cold War a very bold story line.

2. While Richard Widmark's role proves acting the heavy and not the good guy would always be his forte the performances of Richard Basehart as the accused major and Martin Balsam as the closed minded adjutant to Widmark's Colonel prove that each were well capable of greater things though fate was ultimately kinder to Balsam in this regard in their respective careers.

3. The film is one of the two movies directed by the ever popular actor Karl Malden (Widmark as co-producer may have had a say in his choice) and one is left feeling sorry he did not take up the directors chair more often based on  this first outing.",1244851200,25,1043,4.531914893617022
3796751,5,B001U6YIB0,"Through his company Heath Productions, this was Richard Widmarks first venture into film production. Directed by his 'real life' friend Karl Malden, Widmark's performance as Colonel Bill Edwards is everything one would expect from this talented actor.

The story is about a group of Korean POWs who were subjected to psychological torture and physical hardship in an effort to make them sign false statements that the USA was using biological warfare. After months of holding out, the senior officer suddenly capitulates and begins to try to indocrinate his men with Korean propaganda. One of the men dies mysteriously. On their repatriation to the USA, it is the job of Colonel Edwards to find out exactly what happened.

The film is set on a military base, Governor's Island,New York, though the introduction and later 'flash backs' take place at Camp Gee Gee in North Korea.

Edward's investigation includes two main characters, the senior officer Major Cargill (Richard Basehart) accused of treason, and Lieutenant Miller (Rip Torn) a main witness.  There are many facets to this investigation and Widmark plays each with equal mastery. He uses gentle coaxing with witnesses at first, then when this fails and he is put under pressure from his C.O. to speed things up, he builds up the pressure to angrily try and get at the truth. There is a moving and tender scene when Edwards visits Cargill's wife (June Lockhart) to try and find out why her husband refuses to defend himself against the charge of treason.

The films serious tone during the investigations is relieved for filmgoers by scenes revealing the amicable and loyal relationships Edwards has with his team - right hand man Sgt Baker (Martin Balsam)and secretary Sgt Evans (Dolores Michaels).

The finale comes when Edwards brings Miller and Cargill together once again. Cargill breaks down and tells the harrowing trail of events that lead to his breakdown.

""You can't expect a man to be hero for ever - there ought to be a time limit.""

This is a thought provoking film with a difficult and at times unpalatable subject matter, setting personal safety against patriotism. It is a film well worth watching for this alone, one worthy of a repeat viewing, and for Richard Widmark fans it is a must.",1235952000,77,2265,4.973544973544974
3796752,5,B001U6YIB0,One of my favorite movies.  The acting is superb.  Love Richard Baseheart in anything he has done.  A wonderful actor who is also easy on the eyes.  But the entire cast is brilliant and the story is great.,1454112000,,205,4.315789473684211

3796754,4,B001U6YIB0,"Good, solid film starring Richard Widmark and Richard Basehart.  Their acting is stellar, as always.  Widmark's character is a military investigator trying to determine if Basehart's character should be court martialed for conspiring with the enemy during the Korean war.  While the case looks cut and dry at the outset, Colonel Edwards' (Widmark) quest for the truth slowly unravels multiple layers of new facts.  This fim is suspenseful and spellbinding as the viewer longs to find out the whole truth.  I highly recommend it.",1445558400,,528,5.238095238095238
3796755,4,B001U6YIB0,The movie focuses on a military lawyer and his task to prosecute an officer who is charged with treason during the Korean conflict.  Though the attorney is being pressured by the CG to move quickly and submit his commendation he refuses to do so until he has gotten all the facts.  If you like Richard Widmark you'll enjoy the movie.  A nice twist at the end of the movie.,1444176000,,372,4.36231884057971

3796760,4,B001U6YIB0,"As another good reviewer put it, ""this movie, based on a play --by celebrated, attorney, novelist and playwright Henry Denker-- documented some of the physical and psychological torture used against American POWs during the Korean War. Widmark, as an investigating colonel, tries to get to the bottom of charges of treason against one of those POW (...) With enough twists and turns for two Perry Mason episodes, Time Limit keeps the viewer guessing"".
Direction by Karl Malden is magnificently non-intrusive, very adequate to the subject matter. The script starts a little artificial for my taste (hence the 4 star rating) but then it grows and gets better and better, with ever deeper and more intense lines, until an excellent final climax with philosophical overtones, where serious arguments are presented by both sides.
Richard Basehart adds the depth of his voice and the intensity of his acting to the role, while Widmark and Carl Benton Reid (as a multidimensional General) are highly competent. In spite of Martin Balsam's talent, his role came to me initially as too conniving and somehow unloyal. It took me some time to see his character as a well-intentioned busybody world-savvy sergeant.",1418774400,,1202,5.1692307692307695
3796761,4,B001U6YIB0,"Great movie with a real plot.  Most newer movies rely on special affects to carry the movie, because today's writers are lazy.",1418083200,,126,4.7272727272727275

3796763,5,B001U6YIB0,"Maybe the best movie of Richard Widmark, even considering that he is a very good actor. It is a pity that the DVD of the movie is so hard to get. I think that it would be helpful to have this movie used in the classrooms when the American history of and the big human problems of war are discussed.",1412121600,2,298,3.9833333333333334
3796764,4,B001U6YIB0,Widmark was always one of my favorite actors.  He displays his immense talents in this role!  A major result of the Korean War was the knowledge that the Geneva Conventions meant nothing to the oriental mind and didn't either during the Viet Nam War.  Our men were brutalized as inhumanely as the Japs did in WWII!  There is not question that the oriental doesn't value human life the way we do in the West.,1411776000,,407,4.45945945945946
3796765,5,B001U6YIB0,"Richard Widmark has always been one of my favorites.  In this powerful film, Richard Widmark is a senior JAG officer tasked to investigate apparent acts of treason by an American officer POW in Korea.  The Korean War is over now, and one officer committed acts in collaboration with the enemy such as signing leaflets affirming germ warfare by America, and the like.

At first the whole matter seems clear-cut, but Widmark soon discovers that all of the involved POWs at the camp are hiding a terrible secret.  Army politics intrude into the investigation, and only the integrity of the JAG officer prevents possible injustice. More would be telling, but this is a fine film that shows that many acts of wrongdoing involve shades of grey and extenuation.  I had seen this film as a teenager, and it made quite an impression on me.  It is terrific that this excellent film is now available on Amazon Instant Video.  Don't miss it.

3796766,4,B001U6YIB0,"This is a powerful, obscure dramatic film about the aftermath of the Korean War POW ordeal. The film is tightly shot although more theatrical than cinematic (something you'd have seen on U.S. television's ""Playhouse 90"" during the 1950s). No matter, it is interesting because it provides rarely seen on-location views of ""cloistered"" Governor's Island in New York City during the '50s. Actors Richard Widmark and Richard Basehart--as well as a young Rip Torn--are superb in the film. This was actor Karl Malden's only feature-film directorial credit as far as I know.",1409270400,,567,5.241758241758242

3796768,5,B001U6YIB0,"This 1950s era B/W film will absolutely have you on the edge of your seat by the time it gets to the climax, which is riveting and unexpected. It does take a while to build up, however, which can be tedious at first. Produced by Richard Widmark and the only directorial effort of his good friend Karl Malden, the film is takes place on a U.S. military base and is centered on the Korean Conflict, but isn't actually a war film.

Widmark is absolutely superb in this film as the military attorney investigating the circumstances and reasons which led Basehart's character to become a traitor. Despite pressures from his superior, Widmark persists in getting to the truth of the matter with good reason as we learn at the end.",1407628800,,724,4.612403100775194

3796772,3,B001U6YIB0,Interesting but not very realistic. I believe the story is based on fact but the dramatization of it was not at all realistic. Some beautiful shots of what were perported to be Siberia and the Gobi desert.,1397088000,,205,4.5675675675675675

June Lockhart is not the loving mom she portrayed in Lassie and Lost in Space but the desperate major's wife who no longer knows the man she still loves. She shows her talents were not one dimensional.
With enough twists and turns for 2 Perry Mason episodes, Time Limit keeps the viewer guessing. Luckily for the major (Richard Basehart), the corporal (Delores Michaels) aiding the investigation has the skills of P.I. Paul Drake and legal secretary Della Street.",1361404800,2,747,5.032258064516129
3796777,4,B001U6YIB0,"The fact that this movie is thought-provoking for any viewer is readily seen by reading the various reviews on Netflix & Amazon. It confronts the viewer with questions that emerged especially after the Korean war broke out. The main question that arises is why did Major Cargill (Richard Basehart) collaborate with the enemy? The answer became evident to me well before the movie's ending, but there were other questions as well that could not be revealed till the ending. Having been a kid during WW2 & later served 4 years in the US Army I have an interest in war movies as one of the ways of learninbg more about why wars are fought. This movie is outstanding in that it not only is very well directed, written, & acted but asks pertinent questions that demand answers. The only thing I noticed about the reviews I read is that none of them mentioned the fact that there was another quesstion that confronts every viewer as the movie ends. But the answer to that question would demand yet another movie - that evidently was not made. Oh well, but the truly critical questions in this movie were answered.",1352851200,2,1107,4.624365482233503
3796778,5,B001U6YIB0,"Because I'm a fan of Richard Widmark I watched this movie on TV last night. Because the subject is so depressing, I can't say that I enjoyed watching it, but the plot and acting were so good that I could not turn it off. As a Quaker, I'm anti-war -- although I acknowledge that some wars are probably necessary. But, no matter what your view of war is, his movie should make most almost everyone who sees it aware that there is far more tragedy than glory to war. It also makes the point that perhaps there should be a time limit to the heroism which we expect of our military personnel.",1331769600,,587,4.25
3796779,3,B001U6YIB0,"Time Limit, 1957 film

The movie starts in North Korea where American prisoners are kept in a hut. One tries to escape and is shot. Next we see Governors Island in New York harbor. The Army has a map of Korea on a wall. There is an investigation into the Cargill case. Back in Korea prisoners receive a lecture from another prisoner on the class struggle. [Is his lecture well-received? Brain washing?] The other prisoners walk away. Why did he go over? Some prisoners died of untreated dysentery. ""Guys who think too much can be fooled."" [Should people be allowed to think for themselves?] Major Henry Cargill arrived. He is read his rights. He admits to the charges to get things over as quickly as possible; he is guilty as charged. But he reacts to hearing his recorded voices. [On the street you see automobiles from the early 1950s.] Colonel Edwards visits Mrs. Cargill to talk about Henry. Her husband doesn't talk about his life as a prisoner. Can people have decent thoughts about the human race? Did Henry have any special fear about one thing?

What was the ""causative factor""? Why did those witnesses all use the same wording (""an acute case of dysentery"")? The general wants action now! The Sergeant talks about Army life. Can pressure change someone's mind? [Yes.] Did his words affect the opinions of 200 million people? Lt. George Miller starts talking about what they wouldn't talk about. One man was chosen by lot. The prisoners are looking for someone to blame for Harvey's death, and pick Connors. There is a very dramatic confrontation in the Colonel's office. General Connors demands the truth. His son was killed by his own men! ""Conclusive proof."" ""Every man has his limits."" Major Cargill explains what happened, he cooperated to save the lives of his men. Was this a mistake? [Yes.] The General asks for the recommendation right now. Every leader has to accept casualties. The Colonel will defend Major Cargill, since the wheels of justice must operate. [The rest of the story is left to your imagination.]

The static situations in this movie suggest it came from a stage play. This drama asks a very interesting philosophical question about prisoners trying to survive. The fact is that among any group of people some will chose to collaborate, or even join the enemy. During the early days of the Civil War many of the captured agreed to change sides; then deserted at the first chance they got. The phrase was ""galvanized Yankees"". Some deserted during the War with Mexico. You could read some histories about Europe in the 20th century, or earlier. Sometimes the whole country would switch sides at an opportune moment.",1318723200,,2650,4.832599118942731
3796780,5,B001U6YIB0,"Technical details-This DVD is in English and had no options for other languages. Audio is mono only and there were no detectable audio problems. Picture is B&W and fit perfect on my 4:3 format TV. Case states 1.66:1 widescreen. IMO, picture detail was good considering the age of this movie. However, there were subtle motion artifacts on this DVD(blurring of image on motion) but you had to look closely to see them. Also, there was no scene access for this DVD or any other extras available. Navigation had to be performed using the remote for the DVD player. Never saw that before. The case shows a scene with Richard Basehart and June Lockhart that is not in the DVD and, since there were no extras available with this DVD(like deleted scenes), you will not see it. I tried to play this on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC using Windows Media Player 12 but I rec'd an error message, Unknown DVD. By playing around with the software controls, I was able to get the audio working but no video. Tinkering some more, I had a pixelated image display and by using the scene access buttons I was able to get the video to display until I used the scene access buttons again. It went back to a blank screen. VideoLAN's VLC Player v. 1.1.10 did play this DVD.

Although this film is a bit stagy due to its origin as a theater play, it succeeds by getting the fundamentals right: a fine cast, taut direction (by actor Karl Malden), and compelling drama.
