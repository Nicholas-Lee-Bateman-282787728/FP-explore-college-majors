8750393,5,B01BKKZRJW,"A wonderful Scandinavian police drama, with neo-Nazis preying on good people.  As usual the good people win, but not without tragedies.  But the Nazis pay a heavier price eventually.  Excellent!",1526428800,,194,5.4
8750394,4,B01BKKZRJW,"V e r y  s l o w  to get into the action, but, once the story line is set up, it takes off and is a good watch.  It is not my favorite of all the many Scandinavian dramas/mystery shows I have watched but it is still interesting and something different for a change.  I think the reason I didn't find it more compelling was that I was only mildly interested in the actors.  They seemed a bit lackluster to me.",1500163200,4,408,3.926829268292683
8750395,5,B01BKKZRJW,"This is a very timely, relevant plot line and the over-all product is top-quality.  It is engrossing, surprising, subtle, intense, and, at times, shocking. In fact, it is a gripping drama that is extremely well-acted. It is in Swedish, with subtitles. If you like Nordic Noir, you'll love this series.",1497744000,3,301,5.02
8750396,5,B01BKKZRJW,"Excellent service by the distributor.

I am a fan of Nordic Noir.  The film is an example of excellent Nordic Noir and will inspire you to watch other Nordic Noir  classics such as Insomnia.",1494115200,2,190,4.529411764705882
8750397,5,B01BKKZRJW,"Excellent. Believable script, good acting. I hope there are more series.

The English subtitles seemed fairly accurate and kept pace with the dialogue.",1491177600,,151,5.565217391304348

8750400,4,B01BKKZRJW,"This story is told from the point of view of the two sides to the clash. One side is the Swedish government which has complex hidden agendas going on from its legislative body right up to its PM. The PR person (pictured on the box) for one of the legislators tries to unravel these sinister doings, starting with the disappearance of her predecessor. This portion of the series starts out strong but after many episodes of more and more conspiracies it becomes increasingly inconsistent and hard to pull together. Government conspiracy shows are hard to bring off and this one only partially succeeds.

What is incredibly better, an A+, is the point of view of those who are rebelling against Sweden's being taken over by outsiders due to its open border immigration policy. These people have become quite radicalized. There is one group that is very violent and only sees violence as its solution. A sister and brother are gradually enmeshed in this group because their mother was murdered by the outsiders. The guys who run this group are psychopathic but fascinating. The two male actors in those leading roles are outstanding as are the sister and brother who come within their ambit. This portion of the story is often edge of your seat type of viewing. There is also nothing complex to figure out in this story. You grasp immediately what these characters want and are willing to do to achieve their goals.

I usually am not enamored with the psychopathic murdering terrorist in any plot. But I must say that Adam Lundgren as
Mattias does one heck of an acting job. He is attractive, dangerous, beguiling, repellant. Really, he does it all and superbly. He is not on the box but he should be. I very much want to see him in something else now.",1468022400,11,1749,4.693811074918567
