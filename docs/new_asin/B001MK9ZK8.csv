8326586,5,B001MK9ZK8,"Dustbin baby is a brilliant movie that I highly recommend.  Based on a hugely popular children's novel by Jacqueline Wilson it relates the story of April, who was born on April 1st, abandoned and left for dead in a dustbin behind a pizza restaurant.  Rescued by a pizza boy who thought she was a cat trapped in the bin, her life continues to be blighted by abuse and tragedy.  The story is told in a series of flashbacks as April, played by Dakota Blue Richards (Golden Compass) skips school on a quest to trace her birth mother.  Her adoptive mother, Marin Bean played by Juliet Stevenson, is frantically trying to find her meanwhile, blaming herself for April running away because she did not give her a mobile phone for her sixteenth birthday.  Both Dakota and Juliet are superb in their respective roles, as is the remainder of the cast - in particular Sylvia Hodgson as the vicious Pearl.",1485129600,,893,4.6265822784810124
8326587,4,B001MK9ZK8,"A low budget 2008 originally made for UK TV movie, that although doesn't have a big adventure or thriller plot or anything, is still quite a nice watch.  Dustbin is a British term for garbage bin or trash can by the way.  Basically the movie starts off with a 14 year old's birthday where her elderly mother doesn't seem to really get what a modern young teenage girl wants, and has given her what she thinks every teen wants, as likely in her day this was the case, a pair of expensive earrings.  April was expecting a phone (not this is set in the times before iPhones and Smartphones), like everyone else at school has.  She has been left out of everything due to not having a phone to participate in and this was her ticket to being normal.  She refuses to put the earrings on to show off for her friends and storms out the door, pretends her new phone is charging when her friends ask to see it on the train to school, then tells them she's going to the dentist, and never goes to school or returns home. April isn't really just acting like a spoilt brat though, there is a reason for why she so badly wanted to fit in and saw the phone as a way of becoming normal.  Her elderly mother isn't really her mother, and we learn how April ending up living with her too and why parenting isn't really something she's going to do without making a lot of mistakes.  It should have been obvious to her though that April wasn't going to want to go to school and the places she was probably going to go, but the problem is at the start of the day she really didn't know a lot about April's origin.

It's a feel good film, the acting by Dakota Blue Richards as April and Juliet Stevenson as the woman she lives with makes you feel for the characters.",1479600000,,1743,4.228915662650603
