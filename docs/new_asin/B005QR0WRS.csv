8483620,1,B005QR0WRS,One of those films slapped together in the UK to deal with frozen assets. Sloppy movie making with a grade D script,1493769600,,115,4.2727272727272725

8483622,5,B005QR0WRS,"The rendition of this marvelously titled film noir in the Universal Vault Series looks fantastic.  Fans of Rusell Metty's cinematography need not hesitate--it's some of his best work.  Movie focuses on odd couple macho bady boy Lancaster and quivering ""good girl"" Fontaine, playing out their tragically-fated romance in a reasonably good facsimile of Austerity London on the Universal lot.  Newton, as usual is hammy, yet entertaining to watch.  Alas, Fontaine doesn't kiss any blood off any part of Lancaster's body, so the title is more poetic than factual.",1484784000,6,559,5.318181818181818
8483623,5,B005QR0WRS,"Thank you Amazon and Universal Archives for releasing this wonderful film! I never thought I'd see the day, to be honest. Well done! Next up - I Walk Alone (1948)",1475366400,,162,4.433333333333334
8483624,4,B005QR0WRS,"Burt Lancaster gives a solid performance as WWII soldier who spent 2 years as a POW of the Germans and it has left him with terrible anger problems.  In the opening scene in a pub he is told to leave at closing time and he strikes out at the pub owner killing.  Fleeing the police he finds refuge in the apartment of a timid nurse (Joan Fontaine).  The following day when she does not turn him into the police a strange romance starts to take place between the trouble former GI and the kind British nurse who finds herself strangely attracted to the bad boy.  While she attempts to help put him on the right track Burt finds himself being dragged back into crime by a petty criminal (Robert Newton) who had witnessed him killing the pub owner.  A romance destined for failure.  A interesting British drama with a downbeat tale.  It will appeal to film noir fans and those that enjoy intense dramatic romances.  Worth a watch probably a three star, but the acting improves it.",1426550400,4,976,4.47457627118644
8483625,3,B005QR0WRS,I liked the movie but the quality of the movie was not good it was copied from A.M.C.(AMERICA MOVIE CHANNEL)which made the movie look very grainey,1409184000,3,146,4.653846153846154
8483626,1,B005QR0WRS,This dvd was awful. It looked brand new when I took it out of the package but when  I played it the sond quality was worse than poor. Thats not all it skipped about every 10 minutes and I had to fast forward it each time to the next part. It. I was very disappointed with this dvd,1402704000,4,280,3.8275862068965516
8483627,4,B005QR0WRS,EXCELLENT AND RARE FILM...BURT LANCASTER IS HIS TORMENTED SELF AND DOES A GREAT JOB AS THE NOIR HERO..THE ONLY WEAK PERFORMANCE IS ROBERT NEWTON WHO IS USUALLY GOOD FALLS APART...RUSSEL METTY'S PHOTOGRAPHY IS EXCELLENT ESPECIALLY DURING THE WHIPPING IS A HIGH POINT IN THE FILM.,1365984000,2,278,5.2
8483628,2,B005QR0WRS,"There really isn't much to add to the other reviewer's comments.  The movie almost reminds one of Les Miserables. Robert Newton relentlessly pursues Burt Lancaster after the former witnesses the latter accidentally kill the owner of a drinking establishment. Burt temporarily escapes the police by entering the small (London?) apartment of Joan Fontaine. She is obviously attracted to him and fails to alert the police of his presence. They gradually grow closer until romance blossoms and both are gainfully employed. Then, suddenly, Newton reappears and threatens to expose them unless Burt works for him in his illicit business. How it all plays out may now seem trite looking back upon a near 65 year old movie. Yet, for its time, it was classic film noir. Redemption leads to a classic battle of good vs. evil with a somewhat predictable conclusion set against a tension filled dark background, with the entire movie propelled by the thunderous music of Miklos Rozsa (will someone PLEASE release this score on a separate CD!). My biggest gripe with this DVD has to do with the DVD itself which is why I only
gave it 2 stars. It was converted to DVD from a poor VHS recording in SP and has a constantly moving tracking problem at the bottom of the picture which cannot be adjusted. It is now no longer available nor is a DVD of DESERT FURY from the same outfit which I ordered at the same time and has color problems. It is no surprise that less than 3 weeks after ordering those two DVDs, they are no longer available.
AN UPDATE: A DVD FOR ""DESERT FURY"" IS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON.",1348012800,8,1582,4.690647482014389
8483629,5,B005QR0WRS,"They keep giving us movies like The Stranger,DOA,Strange Love Of Martha Ivers,etc(All great films,but how many times are they going to keep putting them out?)PLEASE.Enough is enough.
Meanwhile great Noirs like this remain in the vaults.
Story,Burt Lancaster is an ex WW2 GI who remains in England after the other Americans return home. One night Burt gets into a fight and accidently kills a bartender in a pub. After a nailbitting chase scene,he hides out in Joan Fontaines apartment and they soon fall in love.
Burt decides to go straight to please Joan driving a truck for a drug company. His past catches up with him when sinister drug racketeer,Robert Newton tells him he was in the pub that night and saw him kill the bartender. Roberts plan,go along with his drug highjacking plans,or else.
Long,long,overdue. It will be well worth seeing when someone,at long last,releases this film.",1323388800,7,891,5.027027027027027
