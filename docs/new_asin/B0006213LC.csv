8036703,3,B0006213LC,These two movies are only about 30 minutes long and are presented as a newscast.  There is the anchor who gives the main topic and then he goes to on-the-scene reporters that give more detailed information and interview people with different perspectives on the events taking place.  I think this movie would be great for youth learned about the civil war and will give them knowledge that other movies may or may not give so easily.,1231286400,2,433,4.684210526315789
