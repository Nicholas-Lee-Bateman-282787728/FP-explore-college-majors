It begins by showing paintings which were removed from a church to hide them from the Germans. [War is about property, to get it or to keep it.] We see Germans marching through Paris. Goering inspects paintings. A champagne goblet is prepared for German officers. In Italy people work to save a famous wall painting from bombing. Can these works of art be saved? Can the US Army send a team of artists to Europe to save them? They will try. Men receive Draft Notices then go to Basic Training. They were selected on their knowledge of real art, to protect them from confiscation by the Germans. Are those real bullets? Some German trucks were captured with boxes of art treasures. So too a trainload of boxes sent to Siegen (and other places). This saves history and culture. Can they get ahead of the Third Army to capture this stolen art? [Note how much smoking they do.] They arrive at the front lines. There is drama. Can they save the Cathedral of Bruges?

Then its December 1944, the Battle of the Bulge. They show scenes with a song about Merry Christmas for irony. [This copies the 1963 movie The Victors.] The Russians have a Trophy Brigade to regain stolen art. They learn about the Nero Decree to destroy everything after the German Fuehrer dies. There is shooting on a country road. They capture a map that is marked. What is behind that brick wall? Claire provides information, she kept notes. [This is slow-moving at times; script or director?] They search another salt mine to find 100 tons of gold bullion! Elsewhere captured art is destroyed by the Germans. One soldier stepped on a land mine! There is a fix. They find barrels of gold teeth! They find statues, some paintings were burned. One mine had its entrance destroyed. Will the German officer talk? This area will be turned over to the Russians tomorrow. The last panel is found before they pull out. Stokes finds a statue at the last hour. The last scenes tell about the successful retrieval of other private art, over five million pieces. Many great works of art were never recovered. Will anyone remember this in thirty years? Yes, when they write a book.

Note how some of this stolen property was taken from an ally. This is a good story, not a great one. It is based on a true story, little known as it was censored for decades. The book must be better. The disappearance of that gold bullion became another unsolved mystery of WW II. [Who had the motive, means, and opportunity?] They did not receive any consideration for showing the use of tobacco products (nicotine is a mild stimulant). Is this movie worth watching? There are better movies and books to entertain and educate you about WW II.",1505520000,,2708,4.6375
