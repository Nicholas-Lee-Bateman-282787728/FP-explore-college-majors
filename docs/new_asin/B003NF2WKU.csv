8400970,4,B003NF2WKU,"Not excactly what I was expecting,but was not disappointed either. This DVD shows great archival footage of the German heavy ships from WW2. I was expecting a little more on the Bismarck,but considering he ( Capt. Lindemann described his ship as a ""he"")had such a short career not really unexpected. The other heavy ships,Scharnhorst/Gnesineau and the pocket battleships/heavy cruisers are well reresented and this DVD is a great addition to my or any collection.",1300924800,10,463,5.27027027027027
