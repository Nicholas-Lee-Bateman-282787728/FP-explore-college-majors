very good but book now ahead of it",1474502400,2,102,3.6363636363636362
7739432,4,B01ER0NOH4,The DVD was great and played fine. It took a while to get here but I think it is a good enough product to wait for.,1473897600,4,115,3.4615384615384617
7739433,4,B01ER0NOH4,"I've only seen one episode, but was instantly drawn to it. I was really disappointed when the ratings on Hulu were pretty low, it deserves so much more.",1469577600,,152,4.464285714285714
7739434,4,B01ER0NOH4,"I had seen this online and wanted a copy. It has just the right amount of story, action, humor, and fan service to make a very entertaining show and with PG-13 rating. Proof you don't have to be graphic or explicit to have a good anime.",1469318400,6,236,4.1521739130434785
7739435,5,B01ER0NOH4,"I found this series a solid work and quite charming.  The characters were engaging and well developed.  The action was only moderately violent so it is ok for kids 7 and above.  This does not mean the plot is overly simplistic.  In particular the Goddess is different from many such characters in that she truly loves her minion, the white haired boy.  She is not aloof, but vulnerable and very human.  Her animation gestures, her personality are very cute.  The overall situation is that of a typical mid evil world with magical monsters, cat or wolf girls, and magic powers.  No guns of course, and I did not see even cross bows.  Adventures make money by collecting magical crystals left when a monster is defeated in the dungeon.  There are numerous gods and goddesses, who in classic style, meddle with humanity for good and for ill.  Overall it is not highly original, but is very well executed.  The series is a entertaining buy for the whole family.",1467763200,,957,4.664670658682635
7739436,5,B01ER0NOH4,"Videos aren't glitchy and came before set date. I have been having trouble with order g movies and the cases being busted and scratching the disks, but it didn't happen with this purchase. Reasonable amount to pay for this great anime collection.",1465603200,3,246,4.880952380952381
7739437,5,B01ER0NOH4,"Honestly amazing, has everything you could ever want. Gives me feels of the first time I played Final Fantasy.",1498953600,,110,4.842105263157895
7739438,5,B01ER0NOH4,"loved it ,  wish there was more , could not stop watching it and went thru all 13 in two nights.  Who says you need sleep.",1498089600,,122,3.6538461538461537
7739439,5,B01ER0NOH4,It's honestly fantastic. Just give it a chance and you will be hooked.,1498003200,,70,4.461538461538462
7739440,5,B01ER0NOH4,"The series was good.  But, I prefer it in English.  You should put it in the ads, if the movie is in English or is it in a different language.",1493596800,,142,3.7
7739441,5,B01ER0NOH4,"Great show, just watch it, that is all I can say. Very nice that dvd worked in US region and has english subtitles. Good job by seller and it was at a fair price for reg. dvd version.",1492214400,,183,3.8421052631578947
7739442,5,B01ER0NOH4,"I was like this seems ok. And boy was I WRONG! I started watching then it got interesting, it got to the point where I watched the whole season(13 episodes) in one night! And I'm sure for those who like anime like Dragon Ball Z will enjoy this one as well!",1489190400,2,256,4.03921568627451
7739443,5,B01ER0NOH4,It was so amazing I couldn't stop watching.,1486425600,,43,4.5
7739444,4,B01ER0NOH4,"This is a show you can watch multiple times and still enjoy.

the animation is crisp with plenty of detail and color.  the characters are fun and likable.

As stated in other reviews, the humor can get a little risque, but not so it dominates the story.

as with many anime, the ending is open, with room for an continuation.",1485475200,,325,4.366666666666666
7739445,5,B01ER0NOH4,"Great show, but wish there was more too it. feels like the storyline has just begun.",1485043200,3,84,4.3125
7739446,5,B01ER0NOH4,"I was looking for a filler in between Sword Art Online (also fantastic) and I came across this anime. A little slow to start, around the second and third episode is where the characters really start to shine. Watching the whole series, I experienced a wide range of emotions but none were more satisfying than the genuine laugh out loud moments this series has. If you like medieval/dungeon crawler/rpg themed style games or anime, you will enjoy this. The story is good but the characters are what truly breath life into the anime and will actually have you cheering for more. Some adult oriented themes and language but nothing I found truly offensive. Also called DanMachi because, let's face it, your friends are going to give you funny looks when you say Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon?",1484956800,2,802,4.654929577464789
8759402,5,B01ER0NOH4,Watched the whole series through twice about a year apart.  One of my favorites!,1526947200,,80,4.714285714285714
8759403,5,B01ER0NOH4,"I started watching this thinking it was weeb fantasy series - which, it is - but in a much lesser way than I was expecting.  By the 2nd or 3rd episode I was completely hooked.  The character designs, animation and story are great, and the plot is fun while giving room for silliness and humor.  I know there's a season 2 out there which features the story line of a side character in this, but I truly hope that the producers will create a sequel or film companion to this season. Bell is an endearing character to watch grow and it'd be a shame is this is the end of his story.  Hestia would never allow it!",1511136000,,608,4.170940170940171
8759404,5,B01ER0NOH4,Very awesome.  =D,1508976000,,17,4.666666666666667
8759405,5,B01ER0NOH4,Amazing,1508630400,,7,7.0
8759406,5,B01ER0NOH4,"I enjoyed it.  Fun anime, although the reactions by the characters are a over the top even for anime standards.  Good first season for hopefully a second season.",1502755200,,161,4.714285714285714
8759407,5,B01ER0NOH4,"great anime, follows the story of the gods zeus hercules etc. but is a whole new look and feel in fact i love it way more.",1502236800,,122,3.730769230769231
8759408,5,B01ER0NOH4,"The world itself I find incredibly intriguing; the way it is built, amusing. There is enough mystery to the dungeon to honestly keep me intrigued with the plot... the real plot..... Not Hestia's, you damned memesters.

It is fun to watch. The protagonist is a likable idiot with a strong heart; likable enough to remain autonomous from the character archetype that he represents. And it is always amusing to see where this series will go.

I cannot wait till the main anime catches up with the established Light Novels.

To even the Jaded anime fans out there, I say this: Come on! I know you want to!",1500422400,,601,4.598130841121495
8759409,5,B01ER0NOH4,This show has the potential of being on the level of fame as naruto! This is a really cool  show!!,1499731200,,98,3.9
8759410,5,B01ER0NOH4,I love this anime because the Main character is totally broken at the begging where he is just so OP he blows everyone away. I enjoy watching the process of him get better and better. I would say this anime is like Sword art online if that anime weren't total garbage and were more adult oriented. The only downside is that the MC is dense as always but other than that fantastic anime.,1499644800,,386,4.301369863013699
8759411,1,B01ER0NOH4,No caption support on Amazon video for this show means no English subtitles means hope you speak Japanese if you want to watch this,1499040000,3,131,4.5
