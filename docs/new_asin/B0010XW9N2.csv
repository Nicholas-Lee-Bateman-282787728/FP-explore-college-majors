8239316,5,B0010XW9N2,Four most enjoyable movies.  Saw comments regarding short run time.  If there was anything missing it was not obvious and did not affect the continuity of the movies.  Am very pleased with the item.,1485734400,,198,4.764705882352941

8239319,3,B0010XW9N2,"Seen this before. None of these four movies are full length.
All run about 53 minutes.
That being said and if you just want to watch some old Roy Rogers movies these are in good shape. Each movie on a single disk.
But if you are looking for full length movies forget it",1198713600,6,269,4.09433962264151
