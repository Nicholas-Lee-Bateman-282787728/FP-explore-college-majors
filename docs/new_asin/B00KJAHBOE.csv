 Performance is ace; Sly and Robbie are on fire but you'll need a beefy subwoofer  to bring out the necessary bass level. OAN both the rhytmic and lead guitar could have been mixed in louder and the singer's voice is somewhat grating at times but for a live TV broadcast from  '81 I'm really nitpicking.",1507075200,2,518,4.255102040816326
