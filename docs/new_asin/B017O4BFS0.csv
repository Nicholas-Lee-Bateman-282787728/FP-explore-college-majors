8739922,1,B017O4BFS0,"I was resistant to write a review, but really this DVD was so disappointing.  There was no PLAN included,just random demonstrations of some exercises.  So basically you have no idea how many to do or how frequently to complete a set.  In fact, there was no discussion of sets at all - just random exercises.  Soooooo disappointed and a waste of $40!",1516838400,,349,4.580645161290323
