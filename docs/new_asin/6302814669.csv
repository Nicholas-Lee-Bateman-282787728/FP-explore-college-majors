516329,4,6302814669,"The classic Hammer Studio's first major foray into the horror genre remains one of its best.  Long unavailable, 'The Curse of Frankenstein' features two great performances from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Cushing creates a sinister but understandable Doctor and Lee gives new dimension to (what had become) a tired role in the Universal canon.  Lee today still has a tremendous mind and memory, and has been doing some of his best work (in the recent 'Lord of the Rings').  'Curse' was followed soon after by 'Horror of Dracula' (now released simultaneously on DVD).  For an introduction to Hammer's stylistics and genre makeover, you can't start much better than these two films.

516331,5,6302814669,"Peter Cushing is at the top of his game in ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"", the very first Hammer horror picture!  And certainly one of the two BEST -- right up there with ""Horror Of Dracula"", which was released a short time after ""Curse"", and also starring these two legends of the horror genre: Mr. Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Lee speaks not a word in The Curse Of Frankenstein, but nonetheless makes a strong impact as the monster created by Cushing.  A solid supporting cast is on hand here as well, along with good atmospheric sets. I believe this to be one of the truly greatest horror films ever produced!  And it started the classic teaming of Lee and Cushing.  This one's got a darn good closing shot, too -- as Cushing is sent off to face the ultimate punishment.

516332,4,6302814669,"""The Curse of Frankenstein"" launched the Hammer Frankenstein series, which was helped by the fact these films ignored both Mary Shelley's original novel and all of the Universal movies about the mad doctor and his monster (the latter because Universal was always threatening to sue).  The hallmark of Hammer's Frankenstein films is that Dr. Frankenstein, usually played by Peter Cushing in his role of a lifetime, is more interesting than the monster, which is always aware of what has been done to it.  This is not the innocent child-monster of James Whale's classic films.
In 19th-Century Switzerland Baron Victor Frankenstein is awaiting execution and tells his life story to a priest in flashback.  As a boy Victor drowned a puppy and brought it back to life, dreaming even them of creating life from stitched-together pieces of bodies.  Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), Victor's tutor, is revolted by the prospect but ends up helping the mad doctor.  Romantic complications abound as Victor ignores his fiancee Elizabeth (Hazel Court), who falls for Paul, while Victor's jealous maid Justine (Valerie Gaunt) gets really jealous.  Needing a brain for his creation, Victor causes the death of kindly Professor Bernstein, but the brain is damaged when Paul finds Victor robbing the grave.  Victor finally succeeds in bringing his creation (Chrisopher Lee) to life, and using it to settle all of his little problems, beginning with the increasingly troublesome Justine.
""The Curse of Frankenstein"" suffers from the one-dimensionality of the two main characters.  Both Victor and his creation are basically just psychopaths in this initial effort.  Terence Fisher's direction is the best part of the Hammer ensemble at this point, followed by Bernard Robinson's set design for the laboratory, with Phil Leakey's last minute make-up for the creature the low point (although you have to admit it is closer to Shelley's original description of the creature than Karloff's famous look).  Although it is technically a sequel, ""The Revenge of Frankenstein,"" the next Hammer film, is much better and there is not reason not to start the series there.",989452800,,2141,5.252199413489736
516333,5,6302814669,"Hammer's version of the Frankenstein story is far superior to Universal's original.  Peter Cushing is fine as the obsessed Baron.  He just doesn't seem to get the wrongness of his actions, does he?  Until the very end, which, in courtesy to the first-time viewer, I will not disclose.  Another great bow by the Cushing-Lee team.

516335,5,6302814669,"Previous reviewers have placed the film historically.  This was the first  horror film I saw in a theatre.  I was 8 years old and it scared the holy  bejabbers out of me.  I couldn't watch scarey movies for a year.  I  subsequently became a horror movie fan, in part to overcome the fear this  move generated in me.  Curse of Frankenstein has always held a special  memory for me. So, upon viewing again I am still amazed by the power of the  unmasking scene. The jerky pan into the closeup of the monster had the  audience screaming bloody murder.  It still works.  Yes, it is dated and,  while bloody for the times, it is pale compared to the blood and guts that  have followed in its wake.  But, it is fast and entertaining, played  straight by a great cast, and, as has been noted, began it all for Hammer.  It also began it all for me in creating a love for horror films and later  all types of film. The 5 stars are ""thanks for the memory"".",962755200,4,946,4.237288135593221
516336,4,6302814669,"Some people probably think this was Hammer's first production(WRONG!)Hammer was producing films long before this one, but this was the one that got them the attention they deserved. This was the one  that blazed the trail to many other Hammer Horror Technicolor Terrors that  would populate the big screen and video market to come.  The lavish set  design and period costumes are wonderful. Acting is nothing, but  superb! There are some genuine chills in this one that the originals did not  have. The scene where the good Dr. throws Professor Bernstein from the top  of the stairs is horrific and is still hard to watch(he was, you know  looking for the perfect brain!).One thing, though, and it is not intended  to be disrespectful to Mr. Lee as it is probably not his fault. The monster  is no Karloff, and Lee's monster staggers around much like Chaney, Lugosi,  and Strange(you know of those old slick W.W. II Universal programmers).Make  up is good,however, and gives the monster a new look that is a nice change  of pace from the old square head & neck bolts! All-in-all, this is a  fine Hammer production, but the sequel ""REVENGE OF FRANKENSEIN""  is superior(hmmm is this history repeating itself of a Frank sequel topping  the original?)",962064000,,1247,4.866666666666666
516337,4,6302814669,"Peter Cushing creates an acting tour-de-force with the role of Victor Frankenstein here, playing him with absolute conviction and unflagging intensity, creating a much larger monster than anything stitched together  in his character's laboratory.  He's quite detestable, which is why I take  off a star.  Watching can be somewhat unpleasant, due to his character.  Christopher Lee is good as the monster, but doesn't get enough chances to  show off the creatures pathos, but he does wonders with what he's given.

I've always been curious about these films, and figured it would be the best time to watch them. I was very surprised at how much I really liked this adaptation of the Frankenstein story. I've only seen the films with Boris Karloff as the monster, but Christopher Lee was just as good and his makeup was amazing for its time. I really enjoyed the story of how Victor Frankenstein went from smart scientist to crazy madman.

In his childhood, his parents passed away and sent for a tutor named Dr. Paul Krempe to teach him everything he knows about science. Years later as an adult, he learns how to bring a dog back to life, so he wants to take it to the next level and create a perfect human being from body parts. At first, Paul is intrigued and onboard, but as the experiment gets deadlier, Paul wants out. Victor keeps grave-robbing and stealing eyes, hands and a brain to create his creature. Once the monster comes alive, Victor realizes he can't control it. If you love classic old school horror, you'll love THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN!!!",1434931200,,1177,4.604761904761904

516378,4,6302814669,"One of the earliest Hammer horror movies, THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN tells a familiar tale, one that closely follows the plot of other adaptations, notably James Whale's groundbreaking film for Universal in 1930.

What makes Terence Fisher's version so compelling is the way in which the story has been treated; for the late Fifties it is surprisingly explicit in the way it depicts Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) handling various body-parts - eyes, limbs - and at one point is shown sawing the head off the corpse that forms the basis of the monster (Christopher Lee).  The principal female characters Elizabeth (Hazel Court) and the maid Justine (Valerie Gaunt) wear period costumes whose dcollt leaves little or nothing to the imagination.  The only concession to the more squeamish viewers that Fisher makes is to refrain from showing the Monster killing his various victims, notably Grandpa (Fred Johnson) in gory detail.

Cushing turns in a memorable characterization of the Baron - an enthusiastic scientist who has spent much of his life being spoiled.  In early sequence, the Baron is shown as a young boy (played by Melvyn Hayes) running the house on his own - ordering the servants around, and engaging a tutor Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) to teach him about life's basics.  This independence, acquired at so early an age, has both positive and negative effects: the Baron learns to fend for himself, but at the same time proves reluctant to take advice - even when it is well-intentioned.  The adult Baron becomes more and more committed to the project of creating the Monster, even if it means contravening the laws of Nature.  Krempe tries his best to dissuade him, but the Baron takes no notice; on the contrary, he becomes quite frenzied in his efforts to finish his experiments.  Cushing suggests this cleverly through a series of bird-like movements; his body taut, his hands flitting across the instruments and test-tubes that clutter his laboratory.

In the end the Baron gets his comeuppance, as he is sent to jail and hanged.  But Fisher does not send him to his death without providing a memorable dnouement, which does not exist in the source-text but emphasizes the extent to which the Baron's brilliant intelligence has been corrupted by his scientific work.

Although only just over eighty minutes long, THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN still has the capacity to startle audiences through its combination of memorable sequences and taut storytelling.  Definitely worth repeated viewings.",1415059200,,2511,5.11002444987775
516399,4,6302814669,"A desperate but unrepentant Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) relays his life story to a disinterested priest.  He brags that he is a genius and explains how he set about creating a person from dead tissue.  He doesn't even leave out the part where he either directly or indirectly caused the deaths of others in his dogged pursuit of science.  This depiction of Baron Frankenstein is hardly flattering.  Cushing plays him as an intellect who never quite grew up.  On several occasions, he seeks to blame his mess on his former friend Dr. Krempe (Robert Urquhart) and unwilling cohort in crime, raging, ""it's your fault!""  A friend who sees him as ""neither wicked nor insane.  Just dedicated.""  This version of the famous tale is grimmer than the previous offerings.  The big reveal of the Monster's face is riveting, shocking.  I like this version but I prefer the old black and white series of films.  They were stylish, this was garish.",1413676800,,934,4.848101265822785

516401,3,6302814669,"Peter Cushing stars as the Baron in a more faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel than the more famous 1931 Boris Karloff version.  It focuses less on the monster and more on its creator and the monster being evil right from the start gets rid of the morality questions of the original.  it also required Hammer to devise a new look for the monster since Universal Studios refused to let them copy the original look.  Terrence Fisher was the director and was the first of many classics in the horror genre by Hammer Studios.

Peter Cushing does a great job portraying the obsessed Baron who is more interested in his creation than in the public's safety. Robert Urquhart was equally good as his foil.  Elizabeth by Hazel Court was underwhelming and served mainly as eye candy; one of the first Hammer Girls. Christopher Lee though he has no speaking role an unusual staggering walk that makes the monster menacing, with a hint of anguish and sorrow thrown in, but regrettably we see very little of him in the film.

The fact that the film is in color adds somewhat to the gore of the film  but it takes deters from the sense of horror and terror by the original black and white. The monster being evil right from the get-go gets rid of the murky morality questions that the 1931 version had, as this film is a straight up ""monster is bad and must be stopped at all costs"" flick.  Notable was  the scene where the monster's face was revealed the first time, as the camera zoomed in on Christopher Lee.

While not the best version of Frankenstein ever, Hammer Films gives it a fresh take and a new look here that is carried by a strong lead performance.  While the scripts were, on occasion, a tad weak, they compensated with strong production values and quality talent on both sides of the camera.",1410220800,,1801,4.544891640866873

516419,4,6302814669,"5* - The Curse of Frankenstein
""The Curse of Frankenstein"" (1957) is one of Hammer Films' better productions, with the great horror talents of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee to entertain viewers. This also happens to be Hammer's first color film and the first in their Frankenstein franchise. Though I prefer my favorite horror actor Cushing as the ""good guy"", I think he excelled in his role as Frankenstein, not only here but in the other films as well. In ""The Curse of Frankenstein"", Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is in prison awaiting execution for the murder of Justine (Valerie Gaunt, whom if I'm not mistaken has played one of Dracula's brides in another Hammer production), a maid in his home. He is narrating his story to a priest via flashback; as a young boy, the intelligent, confident and wealthy Frankenstein forms a close friendship with his tutor, Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), and the two become partners in the various medical experiments thought up by Frankenstein. One of these experiments involves bringing a dead dog back to life, and Frankenstein is so ecstatic at his success, that he decides to create life itself in the human body, by piecing together different parts of the body. Paul Krempe finds this an abomination and refuses to participate, and is on the point of leaving, when Elizabeth (Hazel Court), Victor's betrothed arrives at the Baron's home. Paul realizes he cannot abandon Elizabeth in the hands of a maniac, and tries to shield her from the horrors of the Baron's experiments. The full horror begins when the creature of Frankenstein's making comes alive and unleashes havoc.

This movie is wonderful for various reasons - the sets, score, and costumes, not to mention the ghoulish manner in which Frankenstein procures the various body parts lend a truly macabre feel to the movie, infusing it with a high sense of Gothic horror. The acting by the cast is simply excellent - Cushing shines as the egotistical and maniacal scientist, and Lee (though almost unrecognizable, but not quite) is believably creepy as the monster (no lines here, but the horror is all too evident in the expressions on his face). The others, especially Krempe as played by Robert Urquhart, enhance this horror drama with their credible acting. ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" is an excellent horror movie in all aspects, and this is a true Gothic classic, a must-watch for fans of classic horror.

4* - Taste the Blood of Dracula
This is the fourth installment in Hammer productions' Dracula series and though hardly one of my favorites in the Dracula franchise, it makes for an entertaining watch. The story line is quite unique in that it centers on a group of middle-aged businessmen who inadvertently cause the Count to be resurrected via an occult ritual conducted by a young nobleman, Courtley. They kill Courtley during the ritual, and leave in a hurry, not realizing that by committing murder, they have not only caused Dracula to rise again, but awakened his anger. Dracula is bent on revenge for his acolyte's death and proceeds to kill the trio off by manipulating their children.

The acting in this movie was actually pretty good. Christopher Lee reprises his role as the evil Count and actually has quite a few lines of dialogue here, all delivered in his usual deadpan style. His blood- red eyes and demented expressions are all portrayed with chilling effect. The three doomed men are also played really well - Geoffrey Keen as William Hargood, Peter Sallis as Samuel Paxton, and John Carson as Jonathan Secker are all believable in their roles as lecherous middle-aged men whose lust eventually lead to their downfall. The two girls who play Dracula's victims, Linda Hayden as Alice Hargood and Isla Blair as Lucy Paxton are suitably beautiful and do their roles justice.

I thought the production values were above average - the score was effectively creepy, and the sets were well-done, especially the derelict chapel that is the scene of Dracula's resurrection and also the final battle. All in all, this is a decent Hammer production though not one of my favorites.",1381449600,,4113,4.956521739130435
516420,5,6302814669,"The Curse of Frankenstein is one of the greatest horror movies ever made featuring two horror icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Lee and Cushing teamed in 24 movies together. Movies like Horror of Dracula and The Mummy are legendary. I think this is one of Cushing's finest performances. It certainly is one of his most famous roles. Frankenstein starts out as a nice kid who is ambitious, determined and a hard worker. As the story goes the deeper he becomes obsessed with recreating like the more mad he becomes and it takes over his life and changes him. Frankenstein in this is someone we don't see as a complete villain. He simply a man who has let his passion overtake his life and ignore the right and wrong aspects of his experiment. Robert Urquhart plays his teacher and mentor. He is a likable character and the good guy. Urquhart gives an excellent performances holding his own next to Cushing. We get a pair of beautiful women in Hazel Court as Elizabeth and Valerie Gaunt as Justine. They turn in great supporting performances. I liked them both. Finally the Great Christopher Lee as the Monster gives a legendary performance. Cushing and Lee play great against each other. The entire movie is great. There are no boring parts and the cast and story are strong. The ending was awesome. I strongly recommend this movie to horror fans and new horror fans.
  Taste the Blood of Dracula is a okay movie. Christopher Lee has brief screen time but his presence makes the film exciting to watch. The plot is about three elderly distinguished gentlemen who are searching for some excitement in their boring bourgeois lives and get in contact with one of count Dracula's servants. In a nightly ceremony they restore the count back to life. I liked this movie. I am a fan of the Hammer Dracula's and Vampire movies. This is not a bad Dracula movie it's just not as good as Horror of Dracula, Prince of Darkness or Scars of Dracula. It's a nice bonus film in addition to Curse of Frankenstein.

516425,5,6302814669,"I am a classic horror film fan with an eye for detail, a good story line and good acting.  ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"" is the 1957 horror film that established Hammer Studios as a force in horror movies.  The movie is Jimmy Sangster's rewrite of the classic Mary Shelley novel. It works well because of the production values (color photography, costuming, FX and music).  The story is is the familiar tale of Baron Victor Von Frankenstein's creating a being from body parts.  The creature he brings to life is bestial but valued by the baron. Of course, trouble ensues and the creature escapes, wreaks havoc.  The movie is well-constructed and benefits from a more subtle approach and heartfelt portrayals by the cast.  Peter Cushing is absolutely perfect as the disillusioned, brusque, aristocratic and obsessed Baron Victor Von Frankenstein. Christopher Lee plays the monster as a tortured, confused and physically uncoordinated creature with emotionally-charged gazes and looks. The movie spends a lot of time of the creation of the monster.  The latter part of the movie deals with the failed experiment. This movie gives a hint of the studio's film production, use of color, costuming and intelligent scripts.  The monster's look is more realistic as to what a patched together creature would look like than Universal's creature.  This film was the first of Hammer Studio's six-film long-running Frankenstein saga.  It is a solid start for a series that would become more violent with each film.  Overall, the film works more as a thriller and drama than a horror fright film.",1369872000,,1581,5.065637065637065

516440,5,6302814669,"Frankenstein's Monster returns to life in astonishing COLOR! THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a monumental landmark in the annals of Horror cinema. As Hammer Film Production's first color picture, it shocked the world with a putrid display of blood, gore, and erotic fantasy. It would be despised by critics as such, however the impact this would have on the genre is unmistakeable. CURSE not only launched the career of television actor Peter Cushing into super-stardom, but also introduced the world to Christoper Lee as the horrifying Monster. This would be the first of many villains that Lee would play for the studio, including his versions of Dracula and The Mummy that soon would follow. In the coming years, the names Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing would rival even the great Vincent Price as two of the genre's most recognizable faces. Here, it is Peter Cushing who steals every scene as the headstrong Baron Victor Frankenstein, a man blinded by ambition and his thirst for knowledge. Cushing is simply thrilling as the Baron, becoming the true villain of the picture through the ghoulish dedication to his work and the dastardly lengths that he is willing to go 'in the name of science.' Terence Fisher's handling of the material is superb as always, blending the dark Gothic atmosphere and mood with signature amounts of sex and bloody violence. THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN would usher in a new era of Gothic filmmaking throughout the late 1950's and 1960's, and is perhaps the studio's finest film.

516444,5,6302814669,"This was the first Hammer production that I ever saw and it blew me away!  Fortunately, at the time, there was no classification of films otherwise, I would've missed this gem (only to see a full-screen, truncated version on TV years later).  I saw The Curse Of Frankenstein several times before it disappeared forever.

Thank God Universal wouldn't allow Hammer to use their copyrighted Frankenstein look.  Instead, the make-up artist (Phil Leakley) created something totally original and, in my opinion, far better.  And the stunning, cold, dead look of Jack Asher's cinematography & the brilliant guiding hand of Terence Fisher made this a horror film that would live on for years.  Of course, one cannot forget the superb contribution from the scriptwriter, Jimmy Sangster (horror films at that time, never had such a quality in their writing).

If you like the other Hammer films, by all means, buy this DVD.  It's the best of all the Hammer films as far as I'm concerned!  And it's widescreen, perhaps, a bit wider than its original theatrical release (1.66) to accommodate today's 16:9 TVs.",1310688000,,1097,5.016574585635359
516445,4,6302814669,"England's Hammer Film Productions had been around since 1934 and gone through bankruptcy, reorganization, and a purchase by Exclusive Films. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, English law required that a certain number of English films be made for every American film imported; Hammer specialized in these ""quota quickies,"" for which Exclusive acted as distributor. But by the late 1940s and early 1950s Hammer's product improved, and a series of business deals brought an infusion of cash. Then, in 1955, the popular film THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT gave the studio a brainstorm: an up-dated version of Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN, complete with color, bloody gore, and heaving breasts.

Seen today, it is hard to know what all the fuss was about; there is no nudity, the gore is almost circumspect in comparison with such films as SCREAM, and the graphic surgeries used to create the monster tend to happen just slightly off screen or in scenes that fade out before anything particularly unpleasant can be seen. Even so, censors were so horrified by the film that they rated it X, and critics were so outraged that they described it as debasing, depressing, and degrading. Needless to say, audiences on both sides of the Atlantic flocked to see it, and ""Hammer Horror"" was born.

Mary Shelly's novel has never been closely adapted to the screen, and this particular version is no different from the rest. On this occasion we find Victor Frankenstien (Peter Cushing) less a serious scientist than a cold-blooded nut who doesn't draw the line at committing murder in order to get the body parts he needs for his experiment (Christopher Lee.) Victor's former tutor and current assistant Paul (Robert Urquhart) becomes increasingly disenchanted with it, considers Victor insane, and remains in the house only to protect Victor's cousin and fiancee Elizabeth (Hazel Court) from harm. But soon even this motivation is not enough, Paul flees the scene, and Elizabeth's curiosity about Victor's lab gets the better of her--with predictable results.

Although it isn't a patch on Universal's FRANKENSTEIN, Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is entertaining in its own way. True, it longer has the power to shock, but the cast is quite good, the laboratory set is fun, and the re-imagining of Frankenstein as coldly evil and his creation as almost machine-like is a stroke of genius. The money came rolling in for the film, and Hammer would go on to make six more Frankenstein films between 1958 and 1973--when, of course, the studio wasn't making Dracula films. The Hammer movies may not have been ""A"" films, but they were certainly better and a great deal more sophisticated than most ""B"" films of their era, and they remain fun to watch. Recommended to fans of the genre.

516480,5,6302814669,"""The Curse of Frankenstein"" (1957) is one of Hammer Films' best productions, with the great horror talents of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee to entertain viewers.  This also happens to be Hammer's first color film and the first in their Frankenstein franchise. Though I prefer my favorite horror actor Cushing as the ""good guy"", I think he excelled in his role as Frankenstein, not only here but in the other films as well. In ""The Curse of Frankenstein"", Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is in prison awaiting execution for the murder of Justine (Valerie Gaunt, whom if I'm not mistaken has played one of Dracula's brides in another Hammer production), a maid in his home. He is narrating his story to a priest via flashback - as a young boy, the intelligent, confident and wealthy Frankenstein forms a close friendship with his tutor, Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), and the two become partners in the various medical experiments thought up by Frankenstein. One of these experiments involves bringing a dead dog back to life, and Frankenstein is so ecstatic at his success, that he decides to create life itself in the human body, by piecing together different parts of the body. Paul Krempe finds this an abomination and refuses to participate, and is on the point of leaving, when Elizabeth (Hazel Court), Victor's betrothed arrives at the Baron's home. Paul realizes he cannot abandon Elizabeth in the hands of a maniac, and tries to shield her from the horrors of the Baron's experiments. The full horror begins when the creature of Frankenstein's making comes alive and unleashes havoc.

This movie is wonderful for various reasons - the sets, score, and costumes, not to mention the ghoulish manner in which Frankenstein procures the various body parts lend a truly macabre feel to the movie, infusing it with a high sense of Gothic horror. The acting by the cast is simply excellent - Cushing shines as the egotistical and maniacal scientist, and Lee (though almost unrecognizable, but not quite) is believably creepy as the monster (no lines here, but the horror is all too evident in the expressions on his face). The others, especially Krempe as played by Robert Urquhart, enhance this horror drama with their credible acting.

This DVD is in widescreen format, in full color, 1:78 anamorphic 16:9, running time is 83 mins, and is Not Rated. Includes an original trailer of the movie. An excellent horror movie in all aspects, this is a true Gothic classic, and a must-have for fans of classic horror.",1257552000,3,2518,4.947990543735225

516483,4,6302814669,"This is one weird pairing. One film is the movie that jump started Hammer's era of Horror classics. It's a first rate film and one of the most important genre films ever made. The second is a end of the road sequel to it's Dracula series, that while not bad, is not the best example of the studio either. It seems odd that the company didn't feel fit to pair this with ""Horror of Dracula""(1958), an excellent film and a good fit for ""Curse of Frankenstein""(1957), but curiously, they did not.

Still, this price is so killer and if you do not own these films it's not the worst set on DVD.

Curse of Frankenstein(1957) is a good Horror movie. Originally planned as a remake of the James Whale 1931 classic with Boris Karloff, this instead was transformed into a hodge podge of ideas from the Whale film and Shelly's novel.

Frankenstein is depicted as less neurotic and more ego-maniacal, Peter Cushing giving a brilliant performance in the role. His Frankenstein is more than just misguided. Frankenstein is ruthless in his endeavors to seek his goal in creating life and is the true Monster of the film.
He shuns all reason including his mentor, Paul(Robert Urquhart) and his fiance(Hazel Court) and creates a Monster(Christopher Lee). This Monster actually has a geniuse's brain, but after being damaged, creates a homicidal Monster with a mind bent on destruction if little else.
Lee's Monster is practically the antithesis of the Karloff Monster. Where Karloff's Creature was more human than human, Lee's is an animal. The Monster arises sympathy but is still terrifying and the make up by Phil Leakey is quite creepy. Lee's Monster is second fiddle in the story but his characterization is one of the characters most memorable and one of the actor's most underrated performances.

The supporting cast act well including  Urquhart as the intense mentor and friend of Cushing's mad doctor, who puts the moves on Victor's fiance. Hazel Court is beautiful as usual and quite likeable. She dosen't have alot to do but than again her character is even abandoned by Peter Cushing, which tells us how dedicated he must be to his project. Valerie Gaunt is memorable as Justine, Frankenstein's French maid whom Victor has an affair with and meets a nasty end when she threatens blackmail later on. She also was quite noticeable as the busty vampire who Christopher Lee tosses about in ""Horror of Dracula(1958)"".

Terence Fisher directs this film with a sure hand, using the vibrant Technicolor to it's full, gory use emphasing on sex and violence themes in a way that future filmmakers will imitate but hardly compare. It's difficult to believe that a film this beautiful is actually a VERY low budget piece, but a B-movie it was and it made a fortune and set a standard for the Modern Horror film. In many ways, this film may represent the first ""real"" Modern Horror film. This led to five sequels and a remake in 1970(Horror of Frankenstein) as well as jump starting Hammer's Horror wave with great follow ups including Horror of Dracula(1958), which the second film is the fourth sequel to.

Taste the Blood of Dracula(1969) is a decent sequel with a bizarre plot but very little actual connection to Bram Stoker or Dracula for that matter. The film follows the conclusion of the previous film,""Dracula has Risen from the Grave(1968)"", where Christopher Lee's Count was impaled on a large golden cross. A merchant views the death and collects Dracula's cloak and blood and keeps them. Years later,a group of well to do older men, getting tired with there usual brothel hang outs go and meet the ultra weird, Ralph Bates character and partake ina  satanti mass! Well, the old gentlemen get cold feet and murder Bates, wherein Lee is ressurected to say some ridiculous lines like ""They have destroyed my servant. They will be destroyed!"". I'm not surprised that Lee wanted to ditch these films with dialouge like that!

However, the real story is actually about old men's children and there repression which manifests itself through Dracula's influence who uses the teens to turn on there parents and murder them. Some of these aspects work very well. Geoffrey Keen and John Carson are very good in there roles as the older men,but it's Peter Sallis who steals the show as the brow beaten, anguished father who meets a rather ironic demise.

The young actors are all pretty good in this film. Anthony Corlan is a better than average juvenile lead and all the actresses are typical of Hammer, lovely and bosomy. It should be noted that this film's strongest point is probally it's libido. Quite a bit of sexuality in this one, especially since this is an uncut print that includes some brief nudity and alot of titilation in the brothel scenes. This would be a foretelling of things to follow in Hammer films. ""The Vampire Lovers(1970)"" made the following year, stresses this with an emphasis on full frontal female nudity and lesbianism.

This sequel is no classic, but is highly enjoyable and does happen to sport a truly awesome climax with Lee meeting another over the top demise by the hand of god. It's an obvious must see for Hammer and Dracula fans, but no where as essential as the Frankenstein film.

Both films are presented in letter box prints with cleaned up picture and sound, but little extras save for Trailers. Kind of a shame there's nothing more, but still, hard to complain.

This is a great buy and if your a Horror fan, you could do alot worse. Add another Hammer film or two and this dosen't make a bad introduction to this essential Horror staple.",1244073600,5,5568,4.793534932221063

516486,3,6302814669,"Although ""Curse Of Frankenstein"" was technically not the first of Hammer's horror movies (""The Mystery Of The Marie Celeste"", from 1935 {and starring Bela Lugosi}, gets that honor) it was their first in a couple decades and it was the one that really launched Hammer Horror as a force.  It came out in 1957, at the beginning of a great burgeoning of horror, and it set the tone for a lot of Hammer's movies that would come and make the studio the UK's most signifigant horror player for years.  So it has great historical signifigance, but how does it rate based on its own merits?  A mixed grade, actually.

  The story is familiar: that of Victor Frankenstein attempting - and ultimately succeeding - to create life by stitching together pieces of the recently deceased and then using electricity hoping to spark reanimation.  And, in familiar fashion, the creation is bestial, rejected by Frankenstein, and goes on to wreak havoc.  The trouble is that the telling of the story is too restrained for its own good.  Now, there's nothing wrong with choosing to ge subtle rather than direct, but ""Curse Of Frankenstein"" is Too subtle for its own good - at places it becomes almost sedate.

Fortunately, the film's cast is perfectly suited to minimize the detrimental effects of too much restraint.  Peter Cushing plays Frankenstein, and Cushing excelled at playing characters where there was a lot going under the surface.  His version of Victor Frankenstein is a quiet, intelligent, and cultured but brusque aristocrat, with great brutality and ruthlessness submerged under a thin veneer of respectability.  Christopher Lee plays the monster and, though he's in surprisingly few scenes, does a great job of portraying a tortured and confused creature with motions and even just the look in his eyes.  The movie focuses more on Victor's attempts to create the monster than on the monster himself; extending the second part and dealing more with that monster could have also been a plus.  On a positive note, you see the beginnings of Hammer's great flair for production design, use of color, etc. - and this was just at the beginning, when they had less resources and the finished project was kind of 'rough'.

  On its own, it's a fine movie.  It doesn't approach Hammer's best, but it's still a good, solid horror movie (although not especially scary; it's hard to believe this was so controversial in its day).  It's also the start of Hammer's long-running Frankenstein saga and, I believe, the first time Cushing and Lee appeared together onscreen.  So even with its shortcomings it's definately worth seeing; it may appeal most strongly to those who prefer their horror from a bit before the late 50s/early 60s boom - the days of Universal Monsters classics and their peers - but I think most horror fans will find it a worthy movie.",1217376000,7,3107,5.110891089108911
516487,4,6302814669,"I have always been a classic Universal horror films fan and was never that big a fan of the Hammer interpretations. This was because of my loyal devotion to the original classic Universal films. If you compare the Hammer films to the true classic Universal films then I would say they pale by comparison. Unfortunately the classic films were replaced with some rather cheaply made quickies in the 40's and 50's. Even though these cheaper films may hold fond memories for those who grew up with them, it is easy to see that these Hammer films were a much needed improvement. The biggest factor was they were shot in glorious color! I know...I know....Color? I love the old black and Whites as they have an unsurpassed creepiness. Now that so much time has gone by, I thought I would give Hammer another try. What better place to start than with Hammer's breakthrough film ""The Curse Of Frankenstein""!

The make-up  pales in comparison to Jack Pierce's genius work, but it does show some style and is frightful!

This flick turned the genre in a positive direction with superior sets, nice color saturation, superb cinematography, more believeable script, and no hokeyness. It also seems to be a Hammer Hallmark to include one or two beautiful and buxom women in each of these Cushing/Lee films.

We begin with Baron Frankenstein (Cushing) relating his tale in retrospect to a priest from a prison cell in which he has been incarcerated.

Baron Frankenstein creates his monster from ""superior parts"" but his somehwat unwilling assistant accidentally damages the perfectly good super-brain (of a renowned professor who the Barons snuffs) in a scuffle. The Baron installs the flawed brain anyway with not so great results -- the monster is a mad killer, strangling an old blind man.

The assistant shoots the monster but the Baron simply gives him an overhaul and the next thing you know, the monster is at it again after pulling his chain loose from the wall.

The sub-plot is that the Baron is having an affair with the housemaid but is betrothed to his beautiful red-headed cousin. When the maid turns up the heat out of jealously and threatens to tell what she knows, the Baron puts his monster to work to allieviate the stress in his life.

516515,5,6302814669,"Curse Of Frankenstein came out at the perfect time.  Throughout the 50s, ""horror"" films consisted of science gone awry type themes-movies like Them(""shoot the antennae!"") and The Deadly Mantis were all over the place.  Basically horrors from beneath the earth/sea and from beyond the stars.  There's nothing wrong with that, I love those films.  Alot of those were pretty bad B pictures, but loads of fun to watch.  When Hammer released Curse Of Frankenstein, it brought us back to gothic horrors.  No one in their right mind could even call Curse a ""bad B horror film"".  It had way too much class, good acting, directing, sets.  Like Horror Of Dracula and The Mummy, Curse takes the bare bones of the source novel and does it's own thing with it.  This may put off some purists of the novel, but I guess you can't please everyone.  The film stars Peter Cushing who was born to play Frankenstein and VanHelsing.  His soft spoken, English charm is perfect for both parts.  Branagh, Shmanagh, I say.  Cushing's Frankenstein is a little less manic than Colin Clive's(though he was excellent too).  Even Clive snapped back into reality and realized that what he was doing was wrong.  Not Cushing.  Cushing becomes more evil and obsessed with each passing minute, never once admitting that he has done anything wrong.  It's all in the name of science, remember?  The monster is of course, Christopher Lee.  His full acting potential wouldn't be realized until he played Dracula and a few other roles down the road(if you ask me, he was definately the coolest villian James Bond ever went up against).  Here he isn't given much to do outside the usual Karloff-like mannerisms, but he does it well, and the makeup looks rather gruesome for the time.  Plus, Lee's monster isn't as sympathetic as Karloff's, he's just an evil badazz through and through.  If you're big into the horror genre, this film is a must as well as the two films after it-Horror Of Dracula and The Mummy.  Curse isn't what you'd call a scary film, but then again, what is anymore?  Universal's Frankenstein isn't what you call scary, but it's a beautiful film that you can't help watching more than once.  I'd say the same for Curse Of Frankenstein.  The bloodshed in the film wouldn't get you more than a PG rating, but I'm sure this film was considered a gorefest in the 50s.  You must see it....and soon.",1126483200,3,2372,4.721951219512195
516516,3,6302814669,"CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN has the distinction of being the first Hammer production to achieve notoriety and popularity.  The initial entry in the several sumptiously produced, overly melodramatic entries, this horror flick finds Peter Cushing as the dedicated if somewhat demented scientist who wants to create his own being.  The luscious Hazel Court (Masque of the Red Death) plays Elizabeth, Frankenstein's naive fiancee and veteran character actor Robert Urquhart is the stalwart friend Paul.  Future Dracula himself Christopher Lee steps in as the monster, but he's vastly underused and not all that frightening.  We've become so immune to true horror during the last fifty years that a film like CURSE OF FRANKESTEIN seems hopelessly dull.  But it's the production values and the sincerity of the actors that have made these Hammer movies such classics.

The second film, TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA, made in 1970 is reputedly one of Lee's least favorite Dracula films.  Playing out like a kind of drawing room mystery, it's tale of revenge overshadows the terror of its vampire roots and leaves Lee with little to do but appear menacing from time to time.  Still, with its vibrant colors and sincere cast, TASTE is far better than many of the 2000 vampire sagas.  Overall, if you are a fan of those unique Hammer films of the 50s through the 70s, you'll want this in your collection.  The transfer is quite good.",1125964800,12,1414,5.004273504273504

516519,4,6302814669,"Shot in colour and released in 1957, ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" is, of course, the film that made Hammer Films a household name for horror/thriller movie fans all over the world. To fully appreciate the importance and impact of ""Curse"", you have to look at it in the context of the time when it was made. By the mid-fifties, horror films had long passed their peak in Hollywood--certainly in terms of quality. Black and white ""quickies"", with almost no budget, were being churned out for teenagers to watch at the drive-in ( at least, those who were watching the screen ! ) Shlock-masters like Roger Corman and Bert Gordon were turning out ""masterpieces"" like ""The Wasp Woman"" and ""The Amazing Colossal Man"".

Suddenly, we have a small studio in England, making a horror film with excellent production values, gorgeously creepy sets, fine costumes, professional actors and a talented director, Terence Fisher. At the same time, along with a classy look, you add liberal amounts of gore ( certainly by 1950s standards ), and a couple of voluptuous ""damsels in distress"" who can scream lustily when they encounter the monster. It was a winning formula that Hammer would raise to an art form.

Peter Cushing plays Baron Von Frankenstein, and his terrific performance dominates the film. His character goes through quite a transformation from curious scientist to an obsessive fiend, determined to ""create life"" at, literally, any cost. His mentor/friend Paul Krempe ( Robert Urquhart )is an enthusiastic assistant at first, but soon becomes alienated by the Baron's frantic and ultimately murderous behaviour. Sometimes body parts are easily available--sometimes you have to be ""creative"" in obtaining them !

Of course, this flesh and blood ""jigsaw puzzle"" comes to life in the form of a hideous, pathetic creature played by Christopher Lee, who soon breaks loose, displaying no appreciation whatsoever for being ""born"" ! As I mentioned earlier, two beautiful women ""round out"" the cast. Gorgeous Hazel Court is Elizabeth, the Baron's betrothed, and Valerie Gaunt is Justine the maid. Justine is, as they say in England, the Baron's ""bit on the side""--when she threatens to spill all the Baron's secrets unless he marries her, you just know that her future is ""cloudy"".

""Curse"" may not be Hammer's best film, but it put the studio on the map and started an enduring partnership of two very fine actors--Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.

The DVD exhibits good colour, with occasional haziness and mono sound. The extras are sparse--a few notes on other Hammer films, and a trailer. I would have loved some comments from Mr. Lee--sadly Peter Cushing passed away some time ago.

Still, if you like classic horror films, ""Curse"" has to be in your collection--its importance cannot be over-estimated. Recommended.

A very sad footnote, dated 30 April 2008. Ms. Hazel Court has passed away at age 82. She was most famous for her roles in horror/suspense films produced by the Hammer Studios and also Roger Corman. A talented actress, she always brought glamour and a touch of class to any production she was involved in.",1087430400,33,3116,5.0505836575875485

Peter Cushing is the Baron and he so completely absorbed in his project where he thinks of nothing else. Christopher Lee has the role of the creature. Because the creature is mute, Lee was able to convey emotional turmoil through physical gestures.
In Hammer's version of Frankenstein it is the Baron that is kept alive from film to film in contrast to Universal's version where the creature was kept alive through the series.

Sure, he's a [bad], but you still end up liking him!  Christopher Lee's Creature, on the other hand, isn't as iconic as Boris Karloff's, and the look is pretty forgettable.

Even without the Karloff make-up it borrowed too much from the Universal classic, particularly emphasizing the monster's transplanted brain.  Stitches were never seen on the critter until the Karloff version, and Hammer had the stitches too.  Christopher Lee, who once referred to his character as a walking road accident, did less in the part than the young actor in I Was a Teenaged Frankenstein.  There was no sense of pathos like in the Karloff version, or the wronged being of the novel.  He killed just because that was part of the formula of creature features.  The monster of the book was romantic, thoughtful, intellectual and more.  He even had a sense of humor.  When Victor Frankenstein tells him to remove his detested form from his eyes, he places his hands over the young scientist's eyes and says, ""Thus I relieve thee my creator.""  All Hammer Studios had was all the guts we would have loved to have in our childhood Halloween houses, but we had to settle for grapes for eyeballs, and spaghetti for brains.  The main value in this movie is the introduction of Peter Cushing as a horror actor and Terence Fisher as a horror director.",1080172800,6,1246,4.753488372093023

When his assistent implies that his experiment is ""evil"", his reply is: ""I wish you would stop saying that"". Christopher Lee is the pathetic homunculus, having nothing in common with Karloff or Shelleys romantic creature, rather a tottering retard, failing to understand his surroundings. Jimmy Sangsters screen-play is witty and literary and Terence Fishers direction is simply marvellous, lavish and restrained at the same time. Like most of the movies with ""Frankestein"" in the title it has very little to do with the novel, but it's a great movie in its own rights, a minor masterpiece. The Warner-DVD do fair justice to the glowing colours, that was one of the trademarks of Hammer's horror-movies.",1078185600,3,1024,5.288343558282208
516524,3,6302814669,"...as quoted from the original 1957 trailer to this, the first of many British produced Horror Classics. The real treat for audiences, after years of viewing films from Universal's camp in black and white is it being rich in technicolor. Director Terence Fisher, a veteran director of cult classics crafted this well-adapted version which would follow a myriad of future films, yet like many other originals this stands out as the best.
WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!
As expected, the screenplay strays greatly from Mary Shelley's original novel, like James Whale's 1931 production, yet it effectively avoids rehashing plot elements from the earlier films. Peter Cushing stars as Baron Victor Frankenstein who is held in prison for murder and his execution is imminent. When he is visited by a Priest, he tells his tale of being obsessed with creating life following inheritance of his family name with the death of his Father. Enter Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) who tutors Victor in the process. After they restore a dead puppy, they resolve to recreate a man - and thus Victor's obsession, and Paul's reluctance ensues. Trouble begins as Victor's cousin Elizabeth (a very young, and very lovely Hazel Court) comes to stay at the Castle, and Victor has a secret love affair with Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt, also the Vampiress in HORROR OF DRACULA). Things are guaranteed to get out of hand even more when the Creature awakens!
Although it is stiff and very slow-paced at times, a clever blend of suspense and camp is woven into the script. For instance, there are graphic close-ups of severed hands, assembled body organs, and although seen only very briefly mentions of halfway decayed cadavers. Thus Victor forms the creation out of several different people. The body from that of a murderer who was hanged. The head and hands from an artist, and the brain from a Professor and Colleague. One must wonder how he seems strongly unrepulsed by this work.
Christopher Lee, although never with a word of dialogue, and reported hated the role, delivers a pretty good performance as the Creature. Gigantic, confused, and tortured. Like the 1931 Frankenstein, he is practically tortured by his Creator. So when he awakens it is only logical for him, having the brain of the man he killed to create him, to identify his killer and attack. Thus Christopher Lee's monster deliberately avoids copying patent Karloff's monster make-up. Artist Phil Leakey designs a network of scars and putty to resemble something out of traffic accident. One eye larger than the other, a sewed up cranium, and incredibly strong.
For collectors of Horror fans this is definite must, but no where near as good as HORROR OF DRACULA, featuring many of the same cast and crew. 1970's HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN followed this film eerily well, so no doubt it made a strong influence in films to come. You almost get around this so well because Peter Cushing portrays the role with such authority that Hammer Studios effectively brings an entirely different personification of Dr. Frankenstein never quite visualized before. He is cold, ruthless, remorseless, and a murderer to boot - HE is the true monster of the film, not the pitiable disfigured hulk played by Christopher Lee.",1074902400,2,3254,5.027777777777778
516525,5,6302814669,"I can recall being 10 years old and seeing Curse of Frankenstein on the big screen for the first time playing a double feature with Horror of Dracula.  With all due respect to the 1931 James Whale version, this treatment of Shelly's novel (albeit freely adapted)ignited my passion in this genre still prevalent and near mania to this day. The superb acting talents of Peter Cushing (Victor Frankenstein) and Christopher Lee (the Creature),et al, beautiful photography and lavish sets (used multiple times in future creature features)left me wide eyed and thirsting for more. This DVD rekindled my affection for the classic works issued by Hammer Studios in the late 50's and early 60's.  The rich colors (or should I say colours?), remastered photography, widescreen formatting, and make this DVD a must have for all horror film aficionados.

The Curse of Frankenstein happens to fall into that category.  This is the movie that launched Hammer films association with the classic Universal monsters.  Though at this time, they were not allowed to copy the monster look from the Universal film.  They re-scripted the Frankenstein story so that more closely resembles the Mary Shelley novel.  Cushing plays Dr. Victor Frankenstein with Lee cast as the monster.  The movie has the trademark Hammer gothic look and was directed by Terrence Fisher.
The picture quality of the DVD is superb.  The picture is presented in widescreen format.  The colors are bright with no signs of scratches or dirt as far as I could tell.  You would never know this movie is over 45 years old.  The sound is presented in its original mono track.  Voices come through loud and clear.  There are very few extras.  There is a film trailer and a still gallery with film facts called ""The Making of a Monster"".  It would be nice to have Lee record a commentary at some point.

The problem for me is the ""monster"" played empathetically by Christopher Lee. The make-up is cheesy. It looks like lumpy oatmeal. He's on screen enough and Lee does well in the role but he doesn't look like an assembled creation. It's not what the monster should look like. The Gothic atmosphere is excellent but the delectable Hazel Court as Elizabeth is underused---she does well in horror roles but you wouldn't know it here.

Im sure everyone knows the story of the Frankenstein monster, so there is no need for details of the film, just let it be said that this, in my opinion, is the best version.",1033776000,3,399,4.333333333333333
516530,5,6302814669,"I've got to thank Warner Bros. for finally coming out with ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" on DVD.  And where as I was a bit suspect of the quality of the film element used for the ""Horror of Dracula"" DVD released on the same date as ""Curse"", I have no complaints at all about the quality of this film's presentation by Warner.
It is beautiful.  And apparently Warner used a very fine quality source print for this release.  The colors are lovely, and the widescreen presentation is satisfying.  As a great admirer of Hammer films, it is exciting to finally see this beautifully photographed film as it was seen on the big screen in 1958.
The story is much closer to Mary Shelley's original novel, though the creature, here played by Christopher Lee, is much like the one portrayed by Karloff; large, horrifying to look at, and almost an ""idiot"" in intellectual capacity, but somehow tugging at our sympathies.  But he is more frightening to behold in this film, with his ghastly white complexion, and bizarre, searching eyes.  As the film progresses, he becomes even harder to behold as he is ravaged by the terrifying encounters that make up his sad, short existence.
And Peter Cushing is astonishing in his portrayal of Baron Victor Frankenstein.  He is a single-minded, driven scientist.  Both brilliant intellectually, and uncompromising in vision.  And yet, he is also not exactly evil, though his actions are, as is seen clearly by the murdering of his one-time lover and maid, Justine, as you see both determination and regret reflected in his expressions, while he listens to her screams.
It's easy to see why, when viewing both ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse of Frankenstein"", these two films made Cushing and Lee international stars and horror icons.  Both films have come to represent all that made Hammer Sudios great in their glory days, with lavish period sets, beautiful color photography, and music scores that rivalled bigger budget Hollywood films.
The DVD itself holds no extras of worthwhile mention.  The facts presented in the small section called ""The Making of a Monster"" are nothing that any entry level Hammer film follower would not know already.  It's a shame that Christopher Lee couldn't be encouraged into doing a commentary, or a short interview on the film's history and its influence on modern horror.  That may not be Warner Bros. fault, as we all know, Lee has been very busy of late on the big screen, and keeps very busy off of screen.
Both ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""The Horror of Dracula"" DVDs are a must for Hammer film lovers.  Hopefully, if sales are good, Warner will release the other Hammer films they hold license to, such as ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" and ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"".",1033257600,17,2740,4.839400428265525
516531,5,6302814669,"A pivotal film in the horror genre, Curse of Frankenstein marked the first classic from director Terence Fisher in the genre. Working from a well written script by Jimmy Sangster, Curse of Frankenstein makes Dr. Frankenstein the focus of the film. Although the film has little in common with the Shelly novel (in fact it has more in common with James Whale's classic film), Fisher's film introduced the gothic atmosphere, action and blood that became synonymous with Hammer.
The only way that you can compare Fisher and Whale's film is in the impact both had with the public and on other horror films. Both films made the horror film a staple of movie houses (horror films had been on the decline during the 40's); both films set new standards for the ""look"" of horror films as well. Peter Cushing brings a vitality and cold intelligence to his role as Dr. Frankenstein. Christopher Lee's unique interpretation of the Monster steals cues from Karloff while maintaining a presence all his own. Lee has admitted that Karloff's portrayal had an impact on his own and, while there are similarities, Lee's is as unique and original in it's own way.
Warner has done a pretty good job with this disc. The picture quality, color and general look of the DVD is an improvement over The Mummy issued last year (and The Mummy looked pretty good). Curse looks better than Horror of Dracula which suffers from some grain problems and a less than stellar print.
Terence Fisher wasn't as pivotal a director as James Whale but his films weren't designed for the same audience. Fisher's films are every bit the equal of many of the horror classics he and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster remade. I'd also recommend Revenge of Frankenstein which Columbia has done a pretty good job on as well.
It isn't perfect. There could be extras (such as a running commentary from a film historian/Hammer expert and actor Christopher Lee), but I'm happy to finally have this film available again. There are lots of things anyone could find fault with but one thing you can't is that this fine film is available again. Warner took Curse and Horror, gave them a very good dusting off and let them take the stage again. We should all be thankful.",1032652800,2,2207,4.765013054830288

""Curse"" is the first color Frankenstein film, and is arguably, certainly in my opinion, better than those that preceded it; it has a more complex and better-told story.
The film begins with Baron Frankenstein (Cushing) being in prison for the murder of several people who he claims were killed by a monster (Lee) he created. Unfortunately for him, no one ever saw the monster other than his assistant and his fiance, and people think he is mad. The Baron tells his story to a priest - not for religious reasons, but because no one else will listen to him and believe what he says. He tells the priest that he wanted to create a human, not just revive a dead body. He says that he stole the corpse of a dead robber, cut off his head, and planned to attach a head with a perfect brain. He kills Professor Bernstein who was brilliant and removes his brain.
He has an assistant that is trying to stop him from performing his experiment saying the Baron does not realize the consequences of his act. The two fight and during the fight the brain is damaged. As we could expect, the monster does come to life and does kill people.
There are several complications that enhance the film. There are the constant attempts by Frankensteins assistant to stop him, Frankenstein becomes engaged to a beautiful woman who he does not want to know about his experiment, the assistant falls in love with Frankensteins fiance and repeatedly tries to persuade her to leave the Frankenstein home, Frankenstein has been having a sexual affair with his maid, she becomes pregnant, is angered that he plans to marry another, and threatens to tell everyone what he has been doing.",1508284800,2,1853,4.75776397515528

7831794,5,6302814669,"In 1957, England's Hammer Studios started doing loose remakes on the old Universal Horror Classics. I think the ones that are best remembered were the ones either starring or pairing Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee--such as the first feature on this DVD, ""The Curse of Frankenstein."" Of course, I believe at the time, there were some legal restrictions that prevented Hammer from totally copying the Universal films, so in ""Curse,"" we get another loose adaption of Mary Shelley's novel.

This time, Baron Frankenstein is assisted by his childhood tutor, who at first assists the doctor, then revolts against the ""abomination"" he has created. Christopher Lee makes for an interesting variation of the monster--or creature as he is billed in this movie. Cushing, of course, is great as the Baron & it's easy to see why this film helped launch so many sequels--great movie.

""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" - This is one of those sequels that seems to come in for some slagging, but I enjoyed it. I'll be the first to admit, it wasn't as good as ""Horror of Dracula"" or ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"" but it's not bad either.
