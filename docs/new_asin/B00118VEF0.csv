3063238,5,B00118VEF0,"Johnny and the Sprites is, in my opinion, the very best Disney preschool show.  It's fun and entertaining, has great moral value and some really excellent modern Broadway-style music.  I was so incredibly disappointed when it was cancelled, but was thrilled to see that I could get a DVD.  I only wish that Disney would release all of the episodes on DVD!",1248825600,,355,4.693548387096774
3063239,3,B00118VEF0,"Although, the characters are fun and colorful, my daughter did not find the DVD too exciting. She could not watch the whole DVD, only one or two episodes at a time. She enjoys the Little Einsteins or Mickey's Club House  much more than Johny.",1243555200,,242,4.5
3063240,5,B00118VEF0,"This video is great.  There are 4 or 5 different videos on the DVD.  They are fun, full of music, and movement to keep kids' attention, and even have a good moral theme in them.",1239667200,,177,4.0285714285714285
3063241,5,B00118VEF0,My 2 and 3 year olds LOVE Johnny and the Sprites so I was happy to find that a DVD had finally been released.  We drove from Colorado to Illinois loaded down with DVD's and they watched this one the WHOLE TIME (about 17 hours!!!).  They didn't want any of their other DVD's.  I think that says it all - it must be a 5 star DVD to hold their attention that long!!! :),1214006400,4,366,3.918918918918919
3063242,5,B00118VEF0,"""Meet the Sprites"" is the first-ever DVD release for Playhouse Disney's amazing, magical series, ""Johnny and the Sprites."" This series, which is now in its second season of the full version, weaves amazing music, compelling characters and touching stories for an experience that shouldn't be missed. The program is complemented by its amazing cast and crew of top-fleet members of Broadway.

""Meet the Sprites"" features the stories (please note that these are not full episodes) ""Ginger's Antenna Dilemma,"" ""Root's Dadoots,"" ""Where's the Water, Lily?,"" ""Basil's Band"" and ""The Sprites & the What?!"" Note that this DVD does not include any new episode content. However, this DVD is essential for fans of the series for one reason in particular -- it includes the original shorts that launched the series. I repeat -- this DVD includes all five of the original shorts, which have not appeared on Disney Channel since the full-length series was launched.

The DVD also has two other neat bonus features -- ""Heads Up"" music video and a sing-along feature. One other thing to note -- this title is part of the Disney Movie Rewards program.",1205798400,5,1134,5.0588235294117645

I bought it after watching previews for it with other DVDs I purchased for my two small boys.  If you want cute kids songs (singalongs) and dancing and puupets, stick with the Wiggles!",1408665600,,281,3.912280701754386

Sad to say after the first 15 minutes he had no interest in it. Don't get me wrong it may be good, but if your toddler is around the same age, he or she may or may not want it.

3063254,4,B00118VEF0,"Watched this with my oldest child and wanted my youngest child to see it too. After watching on Netflix, bought the Dvd for his birthday. The kids love it, the music, the sprites, and Johnny. I wish it was still on television, but there are a lot of the episodes on here. Better programming than most for young children, and the sounds don't annoy me as some do.",1293321600,,362,4.338235294117647
3063255,5,B00118VEF0,"Johnny and the Sprites is a wonderful kid's show about a young song writer who lives near a magical grove with four sprites who control the air, water and earth.

I wish all the episodes would come out as my niece loves them.  There's adorable puppets, great songs and a meaningful lesson with each episode.  I also like that the messages will appeal to most people regardless of race, religion or personal opinions.

Hopefully more episodes will come to DVD as the show really is a lot of fun.  I think most parents will enjoy watching this with their children.

Thank you.  :)",1269302400,3,578,4.553398058252427
