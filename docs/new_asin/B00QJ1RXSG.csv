6870770,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"My 2-year-old has a significant speech delay and absolutely loves these videos.  He has no interest in TV or videos except for a Beatles music video for Hide Your Love Away and the Busy Beavers videos.  He doesn't use any words consistently, but now knows all of his letters and can identify them in order and place them in order when they are presented to him out of order.  Just amazing.",1423699200,,389,4.450704225352113
6870771,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"Discovered this on YT and now have sushi end and brought the DVD's. I have to say, we watch this with our baby and he loves it. We keep reinforcing it by singing the songs and using picture books to go over the numbers and letters and the results have been amazing! He can count to fifteen in English and to five in French, recognizes and says 9 different colors, recognizes and says  6 different shapes, knows his alphabet and will recognize and say any letter and tell you the sound it makes...and he's not even two yet. It blows my mind how much the songs help him retain. Seriously buy this, you won't regret it.",1423094400,,616,4.310344827586207
6870772,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"My son LOVES busy beavers. My mother (his grandma) is suprised how my two year old already knows how to count to twenty, can identify letters in the alphabet and sound them out, and knows a lot of his colors. I was going on Youtube for awhile and letting him watch some of the free video there and I'm now deciding to buy the DVD's.",1422403200,,332,4.123076923076923
6870773,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"Our toddler has fallen in love with these learning videos... I mean, he has a craving for knowledge & will stop whatever he's doing (& special request daily) to watch Shapes, ABC's, etc. Much to my dismay, I can't stand them haha, but there's just something about the colors, slowness & the way the videos are made... We feel these really helps reinforce what we're already teaching him! He's already singing his ABC's to the end, spells words just looking at the letters, counts past 10, finishing simple sentences & on track with many 3 year olds in the basics, & he's only 2 yrs, 2 mo. old! We think these videos are an important component to his advancement... Even when I want to claw my eyes/ears out (no disrespect, Busy Beavers, you're definitely doing a great job!)",1421798400,2,774,4.615942028985507
6870774,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"I absolutely LOVE Busy Beavers!  My 2 year old daughter has something called a Sensory Processing Disorder, which is somewhere on the autism spectrum.  She is very smart, but learns a little differently than other kids.  The Busy Beavers dvd's have bright colors, fun songs & chants, which help hold her attention, & the repetition helps make everything she's learning stick.  These programs have achieved more in the few months she's watched them, than the last year I've been trying to work with her.  Yes, you can watch them for free on Youtube, but I strongly believe the constant Ads interfere with the learning process.  Sometimes, she gets so agitated when an Ad pops up, I can't get her to watch the rest of the lessons.  So yes, I bought the dvd's & I'm so happy with her progress, I could cry!",1421539200,6,803,4.612676056338028
6870775,1,B00QJ1RXSG,"My boys (ages 3 & 2) absolutely love BB. It has been very beneficial in their thirst for knowledge and believe this is a great tool when introducing the alphabet, numbers, colors and shapes. The DVD however is not user friendly. It does not play through each selection when played in our vehicle like a CD does on your radio.",1458518400,3,325,4.433333333333334
6870776,4,B00QJ1RXSG,Sometimes want play all the way thru. Have to press play on each one,1456876800,,68,3.9285714285714284
6870777,5,B00QJ1RXSG,I have a 3 year old on the autism spectrum he absolutely loves all of the busy beaver DVDs. We have ordered three others as well and due to the repetitive nature of these videos he has learned so much in such a short time,1454457600,3,221,3.933333333333333
6870778,5,B00QJ1RXSG,I bought this back in December and my two year old son fell in love with it instantly. He knows the whole alphabet and his numbers. Watching these and us working with him he learned it all in one month. He can count to 20 at 2yrs old. I highly recommend all the busy beaver videos.,1453507200,,281,4.035714285714286
6870779,3,B00QJ1RXSG,"my son really likes the busy beaver videos, his favorite (the baby beavers jumping on piano ABCS) video is different on this dvd though, kinda disappointed as that video was the reason i purchased this dvd but still great for teaching ABCS and 123s",1449532800,,248,4.659090909090909
6870780,5,B00QJ1RXSG,My grandson loves Busy Beavers.,1447027200,,31,5.4
6870781,1,B00QJ1RXSG,"This item is good in terms of the video contents. However, I bought this (together with ""Colors and shapes"" and more) so that while I am listening to music or radio in car while driving, my children can be watching the DVD and listening through their headset but I had a horrible experience. I ignored previous reviews with the hope and anticipation that the manufacturers have made the product better but boy was i wrong!?
The DVD will play a scene or so and stop. I have to keep pressing play for the next scene or chapter which 1, defeats the purpose of me listening to something else and 2, what even makes it worse is that sometimes when I hit the ""next chapter"" button, it goes right back to the beginning of the chapter that just ended. You would think that it will be better at home with a regular DVD or bluray play but that is not the case. You still have to keep pressing ""next/play next"" at the end of every chapter. REALLY FRUSTRATING. If you ask me, I wuld say don't buy this product unless you have the patience and time to keep pressing.",1446508800,3,1053,4.3232323232323235
6870782,2,B00QJ1RXSG,"You are not able to choose what you want to watch and you have to go back after each lesson and press play.  It does not save time for a mother whom is just trying to run to throw a load of clothes in the washer, wash dishes or even cook.  I found the link on you-tube and hoped it would play all the songs without stopping.  I may as well continue to let him use my laptop to watch Busy Beavers.  I was very disappointed and wish it was better.  Please fix the problem so we may support you more.",1444262400,3,497,3.881188118811881
6870783,3,B00QJ1RXSG,my child loves it BUT its a pain to use since it does not play all.. as states.. you have to change after each song,1441065600,,115,3.64
6870784,2,B00QJ1RXSG,"I threw the disc in the bin after 4 days. the MAIN MENU drove me insane. Sure it says PLAY ALL, but when you select it, it does not allow you to play all of the video. Instead your only option is to select a new song / track after each 2minutes.. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!
NOT USER FRIENDLY!! So every 2 minutes my daughter comes to me to play her another track!! Just stupid. Major fault. Do not buy unless you want to completely waste your time!",1435449600,4,446,4.1976744186046515
6870785,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"I must say, after looking for a long while, this video training method works. Team Umizoomi is great, however, Busy Beaver's direct approach gives a child a viable core of knowledge needed to succeed. The method keeps the child's focus and allows the repetitive process to work on a faster level. Exposure is direct - songs contain the correct content without interruption of thought process. For instance, your child can sing to 10 without any unnecessary rhymes being injected into the song - a distraction from thought for many children. Then the accumulated thought is presented as a simple 1 to 10 count. Same with ABC's as well. I recommend getting all the educational videos from the same source. Keeping the same characters helps keep the child focused on the new material to be learned and not the presentation only. Excellent!",1433030400,,836,4.9361702127659575
6870786,5,B00QJ1RXSG,I recommend this item. My one year old boy loves this CD and yet he's doing the alphabet sound. Even my mother who's a foreigner is learning with it.,1431734400,,149,4.172413793103448
6870787,1,B00QJ1RXSG,"Do not get this item! There is no ""play all"" option. So after every 1-2 minute song, you have to press play for the next song to play. This is just a horrible functionality flaw! I won't be buying any busy beaver videos again!!",1431043200,2,227,4.181818181818182
6870788,1,B00QJ1RXSG,"I have tried both in my car, and in my DVD player for our home Television and the DVD does not let you ""Play all"". It only plays song at a time and the song is 30 seconds and therefore it is completely useless in my vehicle because you can't play all.",1430438400,4,251,3.8461538461538463
6870789,5,B00QJ1RXSG,My boys are learning fast now. You have to buy this for your kids.,1430265600,,66,3.7857142857142856
6870790,5,B00QJ1RXSG,A fun easy way for your child (or children) to learn their ABC's and 123. Love it!,1428278400,,82,3.8823529411764706
6870791,5,B00QJ1RXSG,Fast delivery & one of the best learning DVDs out there. It catches  kids attention & they love to sing along!,1427846400,,110,4.238095238095238

6870793,5,B00QJ1RXSG,love these,1424995200,,10,4.5
6870794,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"Definitely worth every penny. My 18 month old doesn't talk a lot,but these dvds has open up a new world for him. He's counting,singing etc... Thanks Busy Beaver",1424390400,,160,4.75

8691433,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"I'm a stay at home mom and we don't plan to put our son in preschool until the year before kindergarten. We want to ensure he is still on track so we have school hour twice a day so for a two year old he is a bit advance for some his age. However he would not consistently say his alphabet these short catchy songs helped him get the rhythm and he saying daily and that was only after a week of watching. Also great when your cooking and need them planted for a while.

Additionally I noticed people were annoyed by the fact that the DVD doesn't continuously play the video. My fix to that was to push repeat all on my DVD player. Then the player will ensure the DVD keeps playing without you having to continuously press play.",1466899200,,727,4.156028368794326
8691434,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"So glad me and my wife heard about you through a friend. My two year old started watching busy beavers about a year ago and I cant believe how many words shapes and colors he knows, hes the smartest kid in daycare! I wish we had done this when our eldest was this age. Great buy!!!",1464912000,,281,4.035714285714286
8691435,5,B00QJ1RXSG,Great my little cousin loves this tape.,1464825600,,39,4.714285714285714
8691436,5,B00QJ1RXSG,My 18 month old grandson loves it.. After 1 month of watching it he is already humming the melody to all the songs and saying a lot of the letters and numbers..,1464220800,,160,4.03125
8691437,4,B00QJ1RXSG,great video for toddlers. Took a while to figure out how to play it continuous but now that I did I like it a lot better.,1464220800,,121,3.6923076923076925
8691438,1,B00QJ1RXSG,very very disappointing,1463443200,,23,7.0
8691439,1,B00QJ1RXSG,My grandson watches busy beaver in YouTube so I thought I would order this for him. The continuous play feature does not work. So unless you want to stand there to start a new segment every 90 seconds it's not worth it. Very disappointed. I know he would have enjoyed,1463356800,3,267,4.36
8691440,5,B00QJ1RXSG,"The two year old twins LOVE this DVD and all things busy beavers! The way they teach through song and all the different ways of letters, words and numbers is awesome. It really keeps their attention which is saying something because one of them doesn't care for tv; she is more content reading books or playing in her room. I highly recommend this DVD and all busy beavers collection!! Great learning materials!!",1461456000,,412,4.736111111111111
8691441,2,B00QJ1RXSG,"It has all the songs I had hoped for, but the play all feature does not work whatsoever. It plays one song, then you have to keep going back to push play for the following song. This is a complete pain because I had hoped it would be good for my stepdaughter to watch while I worked on school work, and instead, I'm getting up every couple minutes to click the next song. I might as well had just kept playing the youtube video on the tv in the living room. I'd be less bothered by that :(",1460937600,,489,4.0
