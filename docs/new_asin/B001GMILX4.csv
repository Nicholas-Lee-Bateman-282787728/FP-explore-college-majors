8306166,2,B001GMILX4,"This is only my second Ingmar Bergman viewing, the first being the magnificent ""Seventh Seal"", which left me with a long lasting impression. Perhaps it is not fair to compare this little ditty to the impressive, thoughtful epic that was the former film, but it was with such unrealistic expectations that I started watching ""After the Rehearsal"".

Unfortunately, I left the film disappointed and indifferent. The plot revolves around an aging play director's relation to his young lead actress, and concerns itself with acting, the personal relations of people in the profession, parenthood and estrangement. Alas, I'm afraid even my simplistic presentation makes the film sound far more interesting than it is. In the end, ""After the Rehearsal"" only amounts to a monotonous (if articulate) study of romantic and interpersonal manipulation. I suppose viewers interested in the theater - that is, theater as a process, rather than theater the art form - might find something of interest in this movie, especially concerning acting, directing, and how they affect persons of the field.

Personally, however, I was not engaged at all to the characters' petty personal issues, nor could I project parallels to issues larger than their own particular microcosm from their mundane -if eloquent- verbal sparring. If the ""Sevent Seal""'s characters could be likened to those of Dostoyevsky's literature, ""After the Rehearsal""'s protagonists would be more similar to Oscar Wilde's aestheticists and their monologues.
