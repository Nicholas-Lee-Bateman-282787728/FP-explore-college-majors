5767438,3,B00D281W4U,"Beautiful camera work but expected more raw footage, personal interviews or SOMETHING MORE for the price.  Love Les Twins and will always support but YAK Films should put more into their product for the price.",1376265600,5,209,4.9714285714285715

5767441,1,B00D281W4U,"I am extremely disappointed that not only is the film unavailable, you don't know when or if this item will be back in stock. Not only did I try to pre order it, I also tried to order the film on the release date. This is a complete let down.",1374710400,5,242,3.86

8588489,5,B00D281W4U,Many of the features on this dvd aren't available anywhere else. And the features that can be found online are only that much more beautiful in blu-ray. Highly recommend to any fan,1494460800,,180,4.65625

8588491,5,B00D281W4U,"quality is amazing, sound is great, video is HD, Les Twins work it nicely. there are 2 tutorials, pretty great pieces. YAK did fabulous job filming and editing! a must have!",1434240000,,173,4.612903225806452
8588492,5,B00D281W4U,Love this DVD! I hope they do another.,1432598400,,38,3.875
8588493,3,B00D281W4U,"While I am a massive fan of Les Twins I certainly don't believe this is worth 60, not anywhere near it, 90% of the content here is already on the Yak Films YouTube page, only a small amount of footage is actually something you haven't seen, few unseen Yak video's with the Twins, some of them are the same video's already on YouTube just with a different song. And a small insight into who and what Yak Films is.

Still, the unseen content on this disc on not available anywhere(believe me I've tried) so that in itself is worth checking out, just don't like the price.",1418515200,4,569,4.367924528301887

8588496,5,B00D281W4U,"This blu-ray is AWESOME :D
I really wanted to buy it for a long time now, but I hesitated because there are already many Yak Films videos of Les Twins on Youtube, and I didn't know if there will be some new parts.
Thank goodness my little brother offered me the blu-ray :) It's incredible, there are new videos that you can't find on youtube, some ""behind the scenes"", an interview with yak films etc...
There is a total of 29 videos and that's GREAAAT.

If you love Les Twins don't hesitate one instant ;)",1401408000,6,506,4.326315789473684
8588497,5,B00D281W4U,I loved the DVD because I love Les Twins so it was a no brainer.  I spend hours watching these guys on you tube so it was nice to see them on tv.  They are very talented and the best and most entertaining dancers I have ever seen.,1397779200,5,230,3.7708333333333335
8588498,4,B00D281W4U,A cool DVD to have a collection of clean dance vids from the twins.  Only downside is that they definitely needed to add some interviews; that would've made the money more worth it.  It was definitely a video made for those who aren't very aware of the Twins' work.,1394064000,5,265,4.387755102040816
