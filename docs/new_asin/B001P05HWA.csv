3736996,5,B001P05HWA,"Billy Connolly is so funny - I could watch him all day. So him in Canada is a treat! Such an informative documentary, making me think I should see more of Canada!",1334707200,3,162,4.09375
3736997,5,B001P05HWA,"We loved this documentary, my husband has been a fan of Billy for years.  I am now too after watching this.  Not a dull moment in this awesome tale of his travels through lands most of us never knew existed in cultures unknown to most of us.  Enlightening, fascinating, delightful.  Can't wait to watch it again.",1327190400,4,312,4.517857142857143
3736998,3,B001P05HWA,"Bought this ONLY because I like looking at landscapes and I like Billy Connolly's humor. Good documentary overall but lack of subtitles made Billy's accent and humor hard to understand, which sucks because I really wanted to get all of his jokes and humor. Neverthless, for the price of the product you get to see some amazing, and I mean really really breathtaking shots of the Canadian wilderness - I never knew places that he goes to even existed, and the music and hauntingly captivating - nice job !!",1325376000,3,505,4.685393258426966
3736999,5,B001P05HWA,"I saw this first on tv with my husband one night a few years ago.  We had never heard of Bill before but were absolutely in love with Bill & the way he presented the wonderful world around us, with deep respect & joyful awe.  We remembered it often, it had that much of an impact.  I got this as a gift for my dad who lives to travel, & now our only regret with this purchase is that there are not more DVDs to watch from Bill!  Make more!  You WILL NOT regret this buy.",1323648000,,470,3.8541666666666665
3737000,5,B001P05HWA,"I had not heard of Billy Connolly before seeing this video.  Beginning in Nova Scotia, he travels across the ""top"" of Canada through the Northwest Passage to B.C., visiting isolated communities, traveling on boats & planes & trucks and meeting lots of interesting people on the way.  After the first 10 minutes, he'll make you wish you could pack a bag & take off on a road trip with him.  It really is fun to watch:  he bubbles over with delight at each new sight or experience.  ""Isn't this wonderful...""  His cheer is contagious and he has an infections enthusiasm for the adventure.  While ""having a laugh"", he also expresses a great respect for the land and people he visits.  The vast panoramas of the Arctic draw expressions of wonder, and he raves about how nice the people are.  There is some humour, and it all seems very genuine and spontaneous.  The music is fun, and the photography is pretty good too.  There are some terrific aerial sequences.
Having now looked him up on Youtube, I think he is a much, much better travel host than a comedian.  The commentary is fun, enthusiastic, and clean.  If you are unsure that a comedian whose standup routine is peppered with f-words, could present a program like this, have no fear.  This series is not only a fascinating & educational look at some remote parts of Canada, it's fun and suitable for all ages.  (Unfortunately some of his bad language creeps into the bonus feature, ""Billy's Unseen Travelogue"", which is otherwise entertaining, if a bit erratic.)",1320537600,,1518,4.718631178707224
3737011,5,B001P05HWA,Excellent trip through Northern Canada with a wonderfully entertaining host.  Billy Connolly excels and his personality shines through as he shows his delight in Canada and Canadians.  I have always enjoyed him as a comedian and actor and had no idea of this hidden talent.  His gentle Scottish accent is a joy and not difficult at all to keep up with.  Highly recommended!,1394236800,,373,4.873015873015873
3737012,5,B001P05HWA,"This awesome journey through the north is made better with a Scotsman's take on his surroundings.  After watching Connolly's Route 66, we decided to give this a try.  I think it was equally if not more entertaining.  If you like travel shows, crazy Scotsmen, and an excellent journey, I highly recommend!",1379808000,,304,4.921568627450981

3737016,5,B001P05HWA,"One of the best things about Billy Connolly is his distinctly Scottish blend of gentleness and sarcasm.

3737017,5,B001P05HWA,Absolutely loved it. Scenery is amazing and it is hard to imagine that certain people live the way they do in the 20th century. The characters that he met were fascinating and the areas filmed were exquisite and I am a big fan of BC!,1370217600,,233,4.2
3737018,5,B001P05HWA,"If you are curious about the northern part of the world, you will love this wild adventure with rock star Billy Connolly.  The scenery is beautiful and Billy's points of view are humorous and refreshing.  It's a very fun to watch DVD.  He travels by boat, motorcycle, truck, and air to rarely seen places.  He's great at meeting people and showing you the most interesting aspects of their culture.  This was a great investment that we plan to watch over and over.",1363910400,,464,4.609756097560975
3737019,5,B001P05HWA,"We saw the Billy Connolly ""Route 66"" and loved that, plus our fathers loved it too. So, we got Billy Connelly ""Journey to the Edge of World for them.
