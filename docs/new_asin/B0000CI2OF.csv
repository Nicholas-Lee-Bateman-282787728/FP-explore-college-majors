7999492,4,B0000CI2OF,"This a pretty cool dvd, it has a few interviews and battles. It's all filmed by a kid with a camcorder so the footage is rough at best. He interviews mostly other kids (breakers) and its all mainly standard ""what got you into breaking"" type of stuff. The audio ranges from good to nothing but the roar of the crowd drowning everything out. Most of the battles are pretty good, but the great stuff is the collages, which feauture some amazing dancing. There are two fantastic old songs in there, good obscure songs not the tired old classics. Also the way some of the battles are shot is a bit one sided with the kid filming clearly favoring his buddies. Decent stuff.",1277856000,,667,4.475409836065574
