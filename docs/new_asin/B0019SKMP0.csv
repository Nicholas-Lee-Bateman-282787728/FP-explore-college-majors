8452799,1,B0019SKMP0,"This movie, like every other Polonia Brothers movie i've seen, is absolute garbage. It's really hard to make me dislike something, i'll usually at least say a movie is ""Ok"", but this one is just terrible. I LOVE dinosaur movies too, so they get the prize of being the first people to ever make a dinosaur movie i didn't like. It's sad because the Polonia Brothers seem like nice people, but their movies are really not good. Typical storyline, 4 friends are going on a trip to a cabin in the woods and bad things happen, this time the bad thing just happens to be a dinosaur living in a lake thats nearby. The acting is pretty bad, but i've seen far worse, the special effects however are beyond bad, from the ""cows"" in the field which are clearly childrens toys, to the dinosaur which is also a childrens toy, its just bad. I started out hoping they might have been able to give me an ""Ok"" movie at best, but sadly, they failed. If you like movies with no budget at all, you might be able to deal with it, i however did not.",1358553600,,1025,4.2615384615384615
8452800,1,B0019SKMP0,"This is a great movie if you are the type of person who loves to watch other people's home movies with a fake looking dinosaur in it. The film is shot on old 16mm film. It is grainy and at times you can hear the camera running. The guys take off to go to a lake home in Pa. on a vacation because they couldn't afford New Jersey. You have lots of footage of Pennsylvania's poorly kept roads and the inside of a car. The monster is described as a reptile on the box. Large carnivorous cold blooded reptiles could not survive in a temperate zone, nor would they be active in the cool evenings.

I found the movie as exciting as watching a stranger's home movie. If any of us had made this film, it would never have been picked up. The Polonia brothers have a reputation among indie films, so it got marketed.

No women in this film except for a glimpse of a naked girl on a drinking glass.

This was John Polonia's final film.",1317340800,,923,4.174157303370786
8452801,4,B0019SKMP0,"From the infamous Polonia Brother's Entertainment comes ""Monster Movie"", the ultra low budget Cloverfield clone that only the Polonia Brothers could unleash on an suspecting world! Yes, I said suspecting. The cover should tell you why.

In these days of ""newly discovered footage found reveals the happenings and mysterious fates of persons chased by an unknown monster"" this low budget shot on video fest is, like most Polonia films, interesting to watch. The story unfolds from 16mm film canisters found by the authorities that tells the tale of a group of everyday yahoos who happen to go camping at the wrong time when an unexplained monster appears in backwater Pennsylvania and leaves a trail of destruction, until the unveiling near a remote cabin lake when the Brett Piper hand puppet looms from the woods. From then on it is run for your life, until they reach a nearby town being attacked by a bunch of creatures, fending of jets. It ends in a garage where the last survivor is dragged out of camera ala Quarantine's similar ""drag in the darkness scene""- leaving us with a possible Part 2. And that is about the whole story.

The DVD has an interesting audio commentary by the filmmakers and tells how they pull of their special effects-using store bought toy horses, the kitchen table as a bridge, night vision shots and family shot footage, ect, ect. Each Polonia film is a low budget class in film making. The special features deleted scenes shows the tests they did trying to composite a scene with the characters and the monster-and other tell alls about the movie. For the $1000.00 they probably spent on this, it is slow but entertaining. The film is even better than Asylum's ""Monster"".

This is released by Tempe Video, which is JR Bookwalter's DVD company, a well established low budget horror director who did ""The Dead Next Door"" several decades ago. Like all Tempe Video discs, they round the extras with current Tempe trailers. Not a bad disc.",1279497600,,1967,4.830860534124629
