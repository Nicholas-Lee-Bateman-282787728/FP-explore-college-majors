3530183,5,B001DHXT7U,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. Its fifth season continues to follow the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,786,5.726495726495727

I have now watched the Season 1,2,3,4....and now viewing the Fifth season.

So glad these great episodes are now available on DVD and at a reasonable price too. Excellent transfers too.

I'm taking off one star as I don't like the actor who replaced Zulu on the show very much. He just doesn't add much to the 5-0 crew. I note that he doesn't stick around long though, scanning through the cast lists in upcoming seasons.",1466208000,,494,4.466666666666667

3530229,2,B001DHXT7U,I don't like these stories of people blaming the alpha male for their own personal shot comings. I bet that ungrateful boy and the fiance enjoyed the financial benefits of being associated with Ricardo. I bet McGarret is thinking that Maltabans wife looks a lot like Steves ex girlfriend.

3530233,5,B001DHXT7U,"Gritty drama set amongst the beauty of the sandwich islands, produced brilliantly and written equally brilliantly, the bulk of the finest scripted by Jerome Coopersmith. Starting with season five we see cast changes,the first of soon to be many with the loss of Kono. Rumor has it the actor clashed swords with the pompous Jack Lord, who already had the show runner and  producer briefly barred from the set! Enjoy the quality of this programmer while it lasts as in but a few short years, the shows top writers would split, along with the supporting acting talent...leaving Twilight Zone producer Buck Houghten to sort out the mess, ultimately forcing a slow but steady decline in the shows quality, and spelling out its future demise as by the late seventies the network would consider renaming the show ""McGarrett"" -- a sad end to a pop culture icon.",1441238400,,853,4.842465753424658

3530255,5,B001DHXT7U,"The fifth season of Hawaii 5-0 has some of the best shows of the entire series. The most notable are: The Jinn Who Clears the Way, Journey Out of Limbo, V for Vashion ( three-part episodes),  The Clock Struck Twelve, The Listener, Will The Real Mr. Winkler Please Die?, and The Diamond Nobody Stole. These episodes are superb and are perhaps the best of the season. The color and sound of each episode is terrific and well worth the purchase price. For any devoted fan of Hawaii 5-0 the combination of the telepays, the acting, and the various musical scores to certain episodes makes the fifth season worth owning.",1420243200,,615,4.6422018348623855

The image quality is very good considering its age, more than 40 years.

3530281,5,B001DHXT7U,"I grew up watching this show and remembered it as one of the many great things on television in the 70s. I remembered it as one of the most exciting, realistic, and gripping police dramas ever to air. I am happy to say my memory served me well and Hawaii Five-O is everything I thought it to be. Jack Lord did a simply superb job capturing the character of Steve McGarret. Lord had presence and that larger-than-life persona that the true star has; and he could act, as well! He was able to convey a vitality and  personality that made the ""Super Cop"" McGarret completely believable despite the character's immense heroic preportions. You have no doubt McGarret is going to bring down the bad guys, no doubt that he is always more than a match for them.

I think it illustrative of the true talent of the writers, producers, actors, and directors of this cassic series that, while it was ""gritty"" and realistic among its peers, it maintained its integrity and did not resort to the overly graphic and coarse content seen in such crime dramas today. Virtually each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps the adrenaline running without the shock effects and cheap, vulgar tactics most television uses today. Jack Lord and his supporting cast were all class acts, as was this wonderful, unforgettable series. I feel truly blessed that I grew up with televison shows like these!",1395187200,,1388,4.684426229508197

3530284,5,B001DHXT7U,"Terrific DVD set of the original ""Five-O"" team. Purchased with another Hawaii Five-O set. Both sets provide great clarity of videos and allow me to view the programs without annoying commercial interruptions. A reminder of when people had to act, and not depend upon today's ""flash and trash"" special effects.  Jack Lord does a wonderful job.

3530296,5,B001DHXT7U,"Greatest opening credit sequence and music in television history.  Jack Lord is always inspired in the lead role.  The acting from all of the other regulars is pretty bad, but the acting is so bad that it's almost entertaining.  Look for the same actors to appear over and over again in supporting and bit parts playing different characters.  Of course the Hawaii backdrop makes the show kind of magical.  Someone should do a count of how many criminals McGarrett killed throughout the series' run.  Every week McGarrett, wearing his blue suit, seems to be blowing away another dirt-bag.  McGarrett is often able to figure out whodunnit by jumping to conclusions which have no business being jumped to given the facts at hand unless he was actually psychic.",1388793600,,757,4.913385826771654

The episodes about the three generations of Vishons are so well written and worth the price of the entire set!  I love seeing the interaction of Steve McGarrett with the criminals.  Because of the writing, in some of these episodes, I find the criminals to be so fascinating, especially Wo Fat!

Ricardo Montalbon, Harold Gould and Richard Anderson all make guest-star appearances, Jack Lord continued with his amazing acting talents making MacGarret one of television's most credible cops, the scenery steals the episodes and the plots interesting.

 Season 5 (1972-1973) led ""Hawaii Five O"" into the Nielsen Top 5 making the show the 3rd highest-rated series that year on all three U.S. networks. This would be the most popular season of the series.",1362355200,,615,5.14

Best writing, probably the episode ever in the series (""The Jinn Who Clears the Way"") and the great three-part ""V for Vashon."" Almost every episode this season has a great story line.

Kono is gone, but Ben picks up the spot nicely, although not with the same warm feelings most of us had about kono. They should have mentioned something about Kono in the season premiere.",1315094400,,440,4.419753086419753

Watch the original Hawaii Five-O and you will never watch the sad remake that is being aired today.

It was an all-time classic and still is. It ran 10 years. I am willing to bet that the new Hawaii Five-o will in no way come close to this record.

3530350,5,B001DHXT7U,"Season 5 is the first season featuring Al Harrington as Ben Kokua, replacing Zulu, who starred as Kono. This has always been one of my favorite seasons of this show, especially the Vashon Trilogy and the episodes featuring guest stars such as Ricardo Montalban, William Shatner, Erik Estrada, Patty Duke, Andy Griffith and Meg Foster. Some good gangster episodes and some good ""social issue"" episodes along with a few below average episodes. Mostly good solid, entertainment with lots of action and drama.

Death is a Company Policy -
Gangster Johnny Resko is double crossed and killed. A letter detailing evidence on his assassin finds its way to HPD. Unfortunately, there is a link to someone inside H5O. One of the best episodes ever and a great start to season 5.
I like the storyline about the gangster getting even from beyond the grave in the form of a letter sent to McGarrett.
A security leak however renders most of the evidence sent to H50 as useless so the main storyline has McGarrett, the DA and the governor trying to find the rat in their own pack.

Death Wish on Tantalus Mountain -
After a mechanic employed by a daredevil race car driver (Ricardo Montalban) is killed, H50 investigates and suspects the mechanic's employer may have been the intended victim. McGarrett clashes with Alex Pareno (Montalban) over security matters and the possible cancellation of future racing events. This makes H50's job that much tougher when and some intense moments between the two before the finale. This episode has one of those eccentric celebrities and families and gives several possible suspects before we find out how the real killer is.

You Don't Have to Kill To Get Rich - But It Helps
William Shatner guest stars as Texas PI investigating a blackmail case for an army buddy in this tale of high tech identity theft, invasion of privacy and computer technology. This is another favorite as the computer technology seems to me a bit ahead of it's time. It would be easy to imagine this sounding far-fetched in 1972 but not so these days. The shots of the dead girl tied to a cement block are genuinely creepy as well as the bell chime effect. The story has the PI (Shatner) becoming sidetracked from his original goal and trying to muscle in on the action.
The scam is to take rich, family oriented businessmen (if there actually is such a thing) set them up with a couple of local girls, have photos taken and then blackmail them for fear of the photos being sent to family friends, clergy and co-workers. A high-tech system of contacts is used to collect personal and business data to be used for the blackmail scam. Shatner is a PI who starts out to help his buddy Wally Schuster, who falls victim to this scam, but Shatner (as PI Sam Tolliver) gets greedy and decides he wants a piece of the action for himself. Invasion of privacy and business fraud and or of course...murder one.

Pig in a Blanket
Another storyline with the issue of police vengeance is brought to light. This is somewhat similar to ""And They Painted Daisies on His Coffin"" from season one. Danny shoots a young man who appears to be armed but no gun is found.
Danny's friend on the force is gunned down by a doper. When off-duty Danny assists in a robbery in progress call, he chases the suspect to the suspect's home. The boy who appears to be kneeling pulling a gun on Danno suddenly appears unarmed. It is never explained why the unarmed boy was kneeling and pointing a soldiering iron at Danno which in the dimly-lit drive way looked like a gun and why no one bothers to explain this as it would've made sense that the boy didn't surrender as order to, was fleeing the scene of a crime and did in fact point an object at a cop that looked like a gun. All Hell breaks loose when accusations of police brutality begin to surface. The search for the missing gun is the key to the story. Danno threatens to resign much to McGarret's disgust who at one point has to order Danno not to talk to reporters who are looking for a story.

The Jinn Who Clears The Way
McGarrett's arch rival Wo Fat returns in this episode about a missing top secret missile guidance device.

Fools Die Twice
Confusing episode about a planned hit which is just a decoy to throw McGarrett off the track as well as the target of the hit. I watched this episode several time but I still didn't get it.

Chain of Events
Controversial issue time - the murder of a health department official whose specialty is sexually transmitted diseases leads to a string of suspects which seems to end at a budding political candidate who has been active with one of the (underage)victims and is also having marital problems for the same reason. The same politician is saved from certain death by a certain irate father who would like to take matters into his own hands. An above average episode that keeps the viewer guessing up until the end. The political candidate looks guilty almost up until the very end and the subject of sexually transmitted diseases is dealt with without becoming preachy. Mary Fran, who had been considered for the part of Sue Ellen on ""Dallas"" (at least according to Linda Gray), has a small but important role as a suspect.

Journey Out of Limbo
Danny turns up in the back of a dump truck beaten and bloody and covered with dirt but is unable to recall how he got there. This episode is a bit tedious and far fetched as Danny regains his memory he also uncovers some sort of assassination plan. A weaker episode if you ask me. Keenan Wynn, who played the role of ""Digger"" Barnes during season three of ""Dallas"" (Who Shot Who?) guest stars.

""V"" For Vashon: The Son (Part 1)
An old ""family custom"" leads McGarrett to suspect the youngest member of the Vashon family in a series of pet hotel robberies. The boy's father also suspects likewise. The suspicions of both prove to be correct. Interesting story line about the rebellious youth who points out the sins of his father while he is no better himself. This episode gives more time to personal side of the villains than usual.

""V"" For Vashon: The Father (Part 2)
The Vashons put a contract out on McGarrett. The story centers mainly on the hit man tailing McGarrett and Five-0 tailing him.  A good episode but somewhat predictable when H50 discover the identity of the hired hit man.
Spoiler Alert:
For what this is worth, a minor complaint is the hitman making his hideout directly across the street from H50 HQ (the governor's office?) seems a little dim. All that planning and he chooses the most obvious place to shoot from ??? This has always bothered me but only a minor complaint.

""V"" For Vashon: The Patriarch (Part 3)
The grandfather of the Vashons plans to frame McGarrett for murder. An above average episode with a story line that has a little twist to it.  Don't want to give it away if there are any who haven't seen this episode or just don't remember.
Part three of this recalls much of the first 2 parts at length and involves a clever attempt not to kill McGarrett but to kill is reputation and frame him for the murder of an unarmed man. (Where have we seen this before?) It almost works but someone in McGarret's circle is the key.

The Clock Strikes Twelve
H50 appear to be running through some kind of drills in preparation for bomb threats received after the arrest of some sort of militant group. The drills and the actual threats seems a little to difficult to separate from one another in my book. The story is kind of slow and uninteresting if you ask me.

I'm A Family Crook - Don't Shoot
Andy Griffith and Joyce Van Patten as the Lovejoys, a husband and wife and daughter flim flam team. The couple end up with a briefcase full of money and two rival gangs hot on their heels. This is Andy Griffith going against character and would have made a decent comedy film. This has to be one of the best guest star episodes and is almost laugh out loud funny in places.

The Child Stealers
A far more serious episode has Meg Foster (in her first appearance) as the female half of a duo of kidnappers. The two kidnap newborn infants and then sell them through an agency in Los Angeles. Lots of dramatic scenes and intense chases herein. An above average episode and one of my favorites.
BTW Meg Foster is not blind - she has very pale blue eyes which almost seem to have no retina. I checked this out on Wikipedia and she has played the part of blind characters on other shows.

Thanks For The Honeymoon
Patty Duke guest stars as a hippie girl who makes a deal with McGarrett to testify regarding a well-known crimelord in exchange for a 24 hour wedding/honeymoon leave from prison (henceforth the title). The whole thing seems a bit ridiculous when it is revealed that her boyfriend shot a cop and this would make him a flight risk unworhty of such favor. How many times have we heard McGarrett say: ""I don't make deals""? Patty Duke is convincing in the role (another going against type) but the storyline seems awkward. At one point in the show Duke uses the term ""mother-jumping"", coming close to one of the seven dirty words you can't say on television. This was before HBO.

The Listener
A truly creepy character with expertise in listening devices torments a psychiatrist, and his patients and wife in exchange for blackmail money. The listeners' identity is not revealed until the end after a series of tragic events caused by his harassing the doctors' patients. A good episode and genuinely creepy villaine.

Here Today Gone Tonight
A businessman is murdered and the prime suspect has an alibi so that the main question is: 'How can somebody be two places at once?'  Disappointing resolution which I won't mention.

The Odd Lot Caper
A so-so episode involving the theft of securities. One of the thieves gets greedy and foils the scheme or something. This is just sort of ok in my book. Not really one of my favorites. This seems to be slow moving and uninteresting.

Will The Real Mr. Winkler Please Die?
I've seen this episode before but the most interesting thing here is the tile of this one. Maybe I'll watch it again and get something more out of it. This is one of those episodes involving government in which everyone is a spy and nobody is who they say they are and it only makes you wonder if the government is really run this way or not. Reminds me of Colonel Flagg on MASH. The general confusion here just makes this kind of dull.

Little Girl Blue
A straight ahead kidnapping storyline - somewhat predictable - in fact if I say anymore I'll give it away. So you watch and you decide.

Percentage
A travel agent who sets up high stakes gambling junkets is murdered and McGarret is convinced the agent's partner is the guilty party. I'm paraphrasing this based on the synopsis on the DVD cover. I personally didn't get much out of this one.

Engaged To Be Buried
Erik Estrada guest stars as the youngest son of a crime lord who is engaged to Alia Kelly, daughter of Chin Ho Kelly. A little variation ""Romeo and Juliet"" is apparent here. Not too much suspense here but some very dramatic scenes.
Rono Vadalgo of the Vadalgo crime family, known for it's shakedown tactics and extortion rackets, seems an unlikely choice for the daughter of Chin Ho Kelly. Shako Vadalgo and Chin Ho don't have much in common either, but both agree that their kids don't belong together. Naturally this leads to both kids feuding with their fathers, although for different reasons. Chin Ho warns Alia about what she is ""mixed up with"" but Alia swears her undying love regardless. Meanwhile, Shako Vadalgo, similarly reminds Rono that he has a ""cop's bullet"" in him and can't walk and considers any relationship to the HPD as a betrayal. Things are made worse when the owner of a new coin operated bowling alley turns out to be a retired Chicago cop who won't give in to the Vadalgos' threats. A car bomb (intended to shakedown the owner of the bowling alley) results in the death of Alia's best friend, Pam. This begins the chain of events that lead to the end of the Vadalgos and reunion between father and daughter.

The Diamond That Nobody Stole
I gather that this one has to with the theft of a diamond and murder but it has always been one of my least favorites here during season 5. It seems to lack something for me - maybe I'll give it another look. Usually, the episodes which become favorites have become so upon there first viewing and don't require repeated viewing to appreciate. As much a like this show there are just certain episodes that seemed to have just sailed right by me over my head and beneath my feet.

Jury of One
Another straight ahead story of jury tampering and kidnapping. Pretty good though - actually some of the best episodes are the simpler, straight ahead stories. (Tell that to the writers of ""Dallas"") A heartfelt story of jurors' young daughter kidnapped in exchange for his vote. The little kid is cute and plus there are a few other twists and turns here before the final rescue.",1289606400,,12966,4.572782084409991

3530370,5,B001DHXT7U,"I loved Hawaii Five O. However This is the season when I began being interested in the show when it firat aired on television.

I blame my father for this interest. in 1972, He and I watched the three part arc V for Vashon. We were discussing it. We discuss family bonds and ties. We also discussed what was morally right.

Steve McGarrett and his team did not break the law, nor did they take into their own hands. Long before CSIs and Law & Orders, this crime show had me spellbound. I would use the term classic TV, but the term is over used

In rewatching these shows, I miss my father (who passed away in 2001) but I enjoy watching these shows as if he was still here. This show may be almost 40 years old, but these shows are timeless. Isn't that what great Tv is all about

Season Five is awesome, especially with the 3-parter, ""V FOR VASHON"".
Every episode is first rate, and kudos to the re-mastering for DVD, which is absolutely excellent. I agree with everybody who says that watching these shows, with the excellent acting and terrific plots, beat any cop/action show on TV today. (Also the scenery gives you an instant vacation, especially if you are in the snowy midwest, as I am right now). For the true enthusiasts, there is a Hawaii Five-O website in existence, which details all of the episodes, and has loads of other interesting data on the show, interviews with the stars and actors and bios. This website features a link to James MacArthur's website, which is also excellent, with extensive pictures of his life and famous parents, Charles MacArthur and Helen Hayes. Check it out.

3530389,5,B001DHXT7U,"""Hawaii 5-0"" was well on its way to legendary status at the start of its fifth season.  It had already established a format of fast-paced storytelling, picturesque actual Hawaiian locations, exciting guest stars, and Jack Lord as the by-the-book Steve McGarrett.  This season carried on that tradition, mixing the tradition police drama with tales that were topical and evocative.

As far as the Hawaiian locations are concerned, the show was a weekly travelogue for the 50th state, offering viewers on the mainland a chance to experience the beauty and allure of the countryside and the high rises that adorn the resort cities.  The color on the transfer is stunning and the sound is equally as impressive.

The guest stars can be placed in different categories, based on their frequency of appearances.  There are those that appeared only once in the show (Richard Basehart, Richard Anderson, Greg Mullavey, Carol Lawrence, Louise Latham, Oscar winners George Chakiris and Patty Duke, and Michael Ansara).  Then, there are those that pop up that were between gigs: William Shatner - who had done ""Star Trek"" in the 60's and was a decade away from ""T.J. Hooker"" - and Ricardo Montalban, who had yet to find his own ""paradise"" on ""Fantasy Island.""

Luther Adler, Monte Markham, Nehemiah Persoff, Mark Lenard, Harold Gould, Laraine Stephens, Diana Muldaur, Ric Marlow, Milton Selzer, Clu Gulager, Lou Frizzell, Madlyn Rhue, Dennis Redfield, and Sandra Smith are ""repeat offenders"" who appear in this season and can be found on others.

Another group would be the ""before we knew them category.""  Michael Conrad (a few years from success as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus"" on ""Hill Street Blues""), a pre-""Chips"" Erik Estrada, Eric Braeden before he got ""Young and Restless,"" a young, pre-""Newhart"" Mary Frann, Robert Foxworth, before he trod the wine country of ""Falcon Crest,"" and both Dirk Benedict and Richard Hatch, before the began their search for ""Earth"" on ""Battlestar: Galactica,"" and Andy Griffith, years after his classic self-named comedy and before he became ""Matlock,"" all are featured in season five installments.

There are also the actors that play recurring characters, from Khigh Deigh as the wily ""Wo Fat"" to Glenn Cannon as Attorney General ""John Manacote"" to Richard Denning as ""The Governor.""

Other recurring cast members are Henry Endo (the dependable ""Che Fong""), Al Eben as ""Doc,"" and Herman Wedemeyer as ""Duke,"" who would, in later years become a member of the  5-0 team. Joseph Sirola is featured as Federal Agent Jonathan Kaye, a role that he would share with other actors throughout the twelve-year run of the series.  Sirola, by the way, lent his distinctive voice to the role of ""Dr. Doom"" in several episodes of Hanna-Barbara's ""Fantastic Four"" series of the 1960's.

Finally, there is, can be called, the ""5-0"" repertory company, those actors that frequently appear as other characters.  These include Galen Kim, Soon Teck-Oh, and Kwan Hi Lim, the latter who would eventually appear in twenty-five installments of the long-running show.  Veteran heavy Douglas Kennedy makes all three of his ""5-0"" spots on this season alone.

The best episodes are ""Death is a Company Policy,"" ""I'm a Family Crook - Don't Shoot!"" ""The Jinn Who Clears the Way,"" ""The Child Stealers,"" ""Pig in a Blanket,"" ""You Don't Have to Kill to Get Rich, but it Helps,"" ""Here Today, Gone Tonight,"" ""Chain of Events,"" ""The Odd Lot Caper,"" ""Engaged to Be Buried,"" ""Jury of One,"" ""The Listener,"" and the ""Vashon"" trilogy.""

There is actually only a couple of bad episodes in the set. One is ""Thanks for the Honeymoon,"" featuring Patty Duke and Carol Lawrence.  Unlike other episodes wherein there is one plotline occurring, ""Honeymoon"" has two, and neither one is captivating enough on its own to hold the viewer's interest.  The other is ""Journey Out of Limbo.""  Though Danno's (James McArthur's) search to reclaim is amnesia of recent events is engaging, the connection between the quest and guest star Keenan Wynn's revenge plot is muddled, leaving the viewer dissatisfied.

In my opinion, there's no better crime drama and it's hard to imagine there ever will be.  If any series deserves a great DVD release, it's Hawaii Five-O.  Unfortunately this isn't it.

If you're just a curious or casual viewer, you may not mind the shortcomings (aside from the ""digital remastering"", which I'm not convinced was even done other than just to convert to digital format.  (The image quality doesn't look any better than my TV recordings.)  However, at these prices, buying season by season, the entire collection will cost[...]  It may be worth it to wait until they exhaust the individual sales for the inevitable boxed set and save a few 100 ""Clams"".

Collectors will not be pleased with the fact that, as stated in the fine print, an episode was left out of the ""Collection"".  In addition, as also stated in the fine print, episodes have been edited from the original broadcasts.  It gives no specifics; just a general statement suggesting general editing.  Could be whole or parts of scenes, parts not considered essential, the speed increased as is sometimes done, etc.  These shortcomings are exactly the kinds of ""features"" we often see in boxed sets to make them more appealing:  ""HQ Digital Remastering"", ""Previously Unreleased Episodes"", unedited ""Director's Cuts"", etc.  And they left it all out of this ""Collection"".

Paramount has told us they've further generally edited these.  So it hasn't been a surprise that I've noticed quite a bit throughout.  Just for examples I'll point out a few I noticed recently while watching 6 sequential episodes.  This is not intended to be a complete list or recount of details.

1) Ep: ""Forty Feet High and it Kills!"" Scene: A humorous back & forth between Wo Fat and the Quirky Professor in which Wo Fat confronts the professor regarding his deliberate attempts to foil ""Mr. Fat's"" machination in the on-going game of mental chess between the two.

2) Ep: ""A Bullet for McGarrett"" Scene: A police psychiatrist goes into further detail/demonstration in order to convince McGarrett that hypnosis certainly could be the weapon he faces.

3) Ep: ""The Singapore File"" Scene: McGarrett outruns Victor in a car chase, then tensely negotiates, without his ID/papers, for passage on a ship from Singapore.",1229558400,,2533,5.217821782178218

3530394,5,B001DHXT7U,"THE GOOD:

This whole set - season 5 - is the best so far; I have the first four seasons, and this one has some of the better episodes I've seen. As others have previously stated, the ""V for Vashon"" episodes by themselves make the entire set worth it; that trilogy, along with some of the Wo Fat episodes, were the best that Five-0 had to offer.

I think this is the first set I've seen that doesn't seem really dated. Mind you, I actually sometimes enjoy the dated quality of some of these classic TV shows, which is why I bother to buy them in the first place - they're time capsules. But it just seems that season 5 stands the test of time and is a bit ""grittier"" than the early Five-0 seasons, IMO. Not necessarily better, just different - and very interesting.

I was also pleased to discover that I'd never before seen quite a few of the episodes on this set. For some reason quite a few of these shows got skipped over the years in syndication (at least in my viewing area), and I've watched a ton of Five-0 reruns.

Some of my favorite episodes in this set include:

""Death is a Company Policy"" (I got quite a kick seeing George Chakiris in the lead, and I rediscovered that Herman ""Squirmin' Herman"" Wedemeyer can really act!)
""Pig in a Blanket"" (Danno shoots another kid!)
""The Jinn Who Clears the Way"" (a very good Wo Fat episode)
""V for Vashon"" trilogy (classic stuff)
""The Odd Lot Caper"" (gotta love armed robbery on Five-0!)
""Percentage"" (a good ol' fashioned gambling-murder drama)
""Engaged to be Buried"" (Chin Ho has problems)

Really, with just a few exceptions, all of the episodes are really good.

THE BAD:

While I wouldn't say that there is really anything exceptionally bad about this set, some of the episodes, well, I'm not sure what they were thinking.

For instance, the episode ""Death Wish on Tantalus Mountain"" misses the mark. It stars Ricardo Montalban in the lead, and although it's not nearly as good as another episode he starred in - ""Samurai"" in season 1 - at least he isn't made up to look Japanese. Poorly developed characters, really bad musical score, and no real edge to the script. Some of the acting is good, particularly the final scene with Ricardo's son. But overall the show just seems really cheesy. I don't know - maybe it's me.

Although I liked the episode ""Here Today...Gone Tonight"" (starring Five-0 regular guest star Monte Markham), I felt that the helicopter twist was far-fetched and not very creative; they could have done a better job of making that believable, because the rest of the show was very strong.

And I have no idea why they wanted to rehash another sniper saga in the same bunker we saw in ""And I Want Some Candy, and a Gun That Shoots"" in season 4. ""Litte Girl Blue"" has poorly developed characters, sketchy plot, lots of exposition, and Jackie Coogan just mails in his performance - which is understandable since he isn't required to do anything except get chest pains.

Also, although I thought the encoding was good throughout the series, some episodes contain scenes that don't appear to be properly color-corrected. I just chalked this up to some of the original masters being damaged/faded, and it appears that could be the case. Still, these glitches are few and far between.

THE UGLY:

Good Lord (no pun intended), who dressed McGarrett in ""V for Vashon: The Patriarch""!! That Tyrolean hat, with the white suit and ascot, was just absurd. Even in 1972 that outfit would have been a big stretch. I think Marie Lord may have had more influence on Jack's wardrobe than we may want to believe...LOL!

=======================

All in all, this is an excellent DVD set, and I'm really bummed because I just finished watching all 24 episodes and want to keep going! I can't wait for season 6, so I hope CBS sees the demand and gets cracking.

I'm looking forward to seeing a couple of Five-0 episodes that I found particularly creepy, and although I'm not sure in which season(s) they appear, I know they're coming soon. One of them stars Danny Goldman as a copycat psycho killer who mocks McGarrett by recreating murders. Another great episode stars Slim Pickens as the father in a redneck family that just goes off in Hawaii, murdering tourists - complete sociopaths, deranged characters even by today's TV standards. I'm really pumped to see those episodes again.

People should wait until DVDs have been released and they've seen them before giving negative reviews; it just doesn't make sense to pan a show before it has been released based on editing of a different series.

My family has immensely enjoyed the DVD releases.  The scenery is gorgeous, the stories are excellent, and the Five-0 team stands for moral integrity as well as taking responsibility for your decisions.

Thoroughly enjoyed the Vashon trilogy in season 5; the thought of Steve McGarrett in jail is too hard to fathom.  Al Harrington joins the Five-0 team in the fifth season, and James MacArthur takes a more active role as boss in the field.

Just wish CBS would release the remaining seasons and do it quickly.  One or two seasons a year is just way too slow!!",1228348800,,1012,4.640449438202247

Picture quality is great, as in each of the previous 4 seasons, and the show itself is better than ever - this is my favorite season so far.  Great writing, interesting stories, top-notch acting from pretty much everyone, including most of the guest stars, and of course the beautiful scenery, funky '70's clothes, and the awesome, unflappable Steve McGarrett, which all combine to make this one of the most iconic cop shows in TV history.

3530415,5,B001DHXT7U,"Although I am writing from the UK, I have recorded a fair number of the season 5 episodes from TV transmission on VHS some years ago, and in any case remember much of the series from the original broadcasts in the 70s.
Season 5 is one of the three best seasons of Hawaii Five-O (the other two are to come, including the very best ever).
I understand viewer frustration when publishers needlessly edit these releases, but apart from the omission of the season 2 episode, I have personally not been aware of any such editing.
Season 4 was released with cheaper packaging and downbeat motifs on the discs themselves, and along with other comments here, I am scared silly that the publishers may not release all 12 seasons (I have the first four on DVD now and would buy the other 8 at the drop of a hat if given the chance).  However the content and transfer is first rate at least for teh first 4 seasons.
Reasons why Hawaii Five-O is -great- on DVD:
- The wonderful locations really come across like they never did on VHS or original broadcast - e.g. the background sounds of the waves breaking on the beach or the wind in the trees, or the bright vivid colours on a sun-soaked clear day.  Some episodes make me feel a little bit like I'm on holiday/vacation.
- In today's world of moral uncertainty, Jack Lord is a breath of fresh air with his clear values, integrity, and respect for the law.  You may not agree with how he handles every situation - but he makes you think.
- As we advance through the seasons, the plots get quite sufficiently clever to make it worth watching for these alone.
- Good plots + strong characters + wonderful locations = a heady mix.
- The series is also respectful of cultures, and deals with many colourful issues.
So my suggestion is that you can't make a mistake by buying this one (S5), and since there is so much great material yet to come, let's keep the sales up, so we might have a chance at getting all 12 seasons?

3530419,4,B001DHXT7U,"This is in regards to those reviewers leaving a single star rating before the actual release of season five. I understand the heartbreak and outrage over the mutilation of The Fugitive TV show by Paramount Video but, so far, the handling of Hawaii Five O has been respectful.

The bad: other than episode promos, there have been no special features since season 1. There is the continued ominous fine-print warning that ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"". Worst of all was the decision not to include the lost episode ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" from season 2. We were ALL waiting for that episode (and would STILL like to see it)!

The good: so far, the print conversions have been stunning, with beautiful color and sharp grain structure. The sound is excellent and, most importantly, all the original music seems to have been left intact. They're also being released as full season sets, instead of the frustrating half-season-at-a-time rip off scheme. As for any new editing, I personally have not noticed anything radical, or any premature digital fades to hurry the end of a scene (as with TV reruns of this show when they insert extra commercials). I hate the idea that anything is being left out from these and I would MUCH prefer they remain totally intact!

I understand giving a defective product a one star rating, and I've even done so politically in the past, but this sort of preemptive strike, Amazon-activism, against Paramount, on behalf of ANOTHER SHOW that they screwed up, is really only hurting the chances of any future ""Hawaii Five O"" releases. I think chances are extremely slim that we will see all 12 seasons released (Mary Tyler Moore only got 4 of its 7 seasons, and that was a popular show) so I was VERY happy to see the announcement of season 5 of Hawaii Five O. If it arrives seriously altered I will be the first to cry murder, but lets please wait until it arrives before we derail the whole train.

I realize it's totally hypocritical for me to now leave a star-rating, but you can't post without doing so. I'm leaving 4 stars based fairly on the last 4 seasons I've seen (THIS WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE FIVE STARS IF NOT FOR ANY EDITING!). If I feel differently with season 5, I will delete this review.

3530420,5,B001DHXT7U,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors.

3530423,1,B001DHXT7U,"Like another reviewer here my Hawaii Five-O review is a protest of sorts, focused on the tragic plight of the classic series The Fugitive as mishandled by CBS/Paramount.

For those unfamiliar with what occurred, without prior warning and following an entirely satisfactory release to both volumes of the first season, CBS/Paramount hired a modern composer, Mark Heyes, to record a synthesizer score, replacing the classic Pete Rugolo orchestrated score and cues which in effect destroyed the nuanced emotional impact and period feel of the series.  The reaction was so overwhelmingly negative that even Variety picked up the story.

So, why would anyone give Hawaii Five-O Season 5 a negative critique when when they haven't viewed it?

Well, consider it karmic balance if you will, because everyone who has positively reviewed the upcoming release of Hawaii Five-O's fifth season without having seen it is performing exactly the same function or rather disservice to consumers, since CBS/Paramount could just as easily make drastic unannounced changes to this series!

Positive reviews of unseen products are the reason why folks get burned buying series sets based upon testimonials prior to release dates!

Conversely, I have no desire to be insensitive to fans of Hawaii Five-O who are anticipating what may be a perfectly fine release.  To be fair, I'll gladly change my review and rating if this release comes out unaltered.

Of course, my goal is to encourage the folks at CBS/Paramount to do the right thing and respond to the public outcry by restoring the original theme music and cues to Season 2 of The Fugitive, but my concern extends to all series under their control.  This cautionary warning may or may not have the impact desired, but CBS/Paramounts treatment of these classic series (including Hawaii Five-O) as property to be issued for quick profit and forgotten rather than nostalgic art will require some rehabilitation before I can be in their corner again.

Great series television begs for release in unaltered form, as aired, with music and all original footage intact.  Minor alterations are always tolerated; wholesale removal and 'creative' alteration is not.  It is imperative to let these folks know the dissatisfaction of their customer base if they want us to continue buying their product.  This probably won't be my last review of an upcoming CBS/Paramount release!

Thankfully, those types of changes did not occur with Season 5 of ""Hawaii Five-0"".  Consequently, I am revising my rating to a 5-star.  Interestingly, Al Harrington's time on Hawaii Five-0 as Ben would be limited.  Apparently Leonard Freeman had hired him prior to his untimely death, and Jack Lord wasn't all that happy with Harrington (there was some speculation that Lord didn't want an actor who rivaled his physical height on the set as part of the Five-0 team).

I would highly recommend purchasing this for your Hawaii Five-O fan. You can also purchase the complete five seasons as a package. You have to buy this season.

Please punish the con artist who sold me this garbage and remove him from Amazon forever to protect your brand name from clowns like this.",1524096000,,250,4.166666666666667
8293381,4,B001DHXT7U,"Fun. Sad to see Zulu gone as Kono, but pleased to see that Al Harrington, who had had guest bits in several roles in previous years, got on a bigger and permanent role. When you see the episode back to back, you notice when bit characters and guest stars make repeat visits, and that can be fun. Worth it to see Jack Lord in that over-the-top outrageous 70s jacket, shirt, and bell bottoms, wide brimmed hat and pink scarf.",1523404800,,423,4.367088607594937
