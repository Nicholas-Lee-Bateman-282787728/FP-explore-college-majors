8600397,3,B00E27NGZS,"The program was originally a special produced by NBC affiliate WBAP-TV and produced at the time on film. Although there are some interesting sequences here, the overall quality is marginal at best. for instance, the shooting of Oswald is from a kinescope of their coverage and of very poor quality. To see WBAP's coverage in high quality, including videotaped source material, get the JFK50 app put out by NBCDFW (KXAS-TV). Much higher quality and longer sequences as well.",1381708800,2,473,5.076923076923077
