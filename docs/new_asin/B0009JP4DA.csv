It was pretty good. It definitely wasn't the most outstanding episode, but I enjoyed it and as a care bears collector can tell you this: The ""demon"" isn't that scary looking, it is mostly pictured as a gray cloud with 2 red spots for eyes, I mean come on, why throw it in the trash? esp. since care bears stuff is of such high value right now. sell it instead.",1179187200,,465,4.166666666666667
8061980,1,B0009JP4DA,"The Care Bear was a big hit! My daughter loved it.

The movie was not age appropriate. There were Demons with red eyes being unleashed unto the Care Bears. My daughter asked why the Monster's would try to hurt the Care Bears. This was a children's movie targeted for 2 to 5 year olds. This movie will go into our trash bin. I am outraged.",1150848000,,338,4.2
8061981,4,B0009JP4DA,"The Big Star Round Up is a thirty-minute treat for the whole family.  With great voice talent, animation, and humor, this is a quality program that adults will like as much as kids.  The story is about the Care Bears and a little girl named Gaye driving a herd of stars to their destination.  No Heart seeks to thwart them.  His sidekick Beastly is so hilarious.

With all the mind-numbing crap out there that passes for children's cartoons and entertainment, thank God for the Care Bears.",1147824000,,489,4.6395348837209305
