8475550,5,B005J9ZFA2,"Great performer and even betterer... er  as a teacher.  Absolutely love his lessons.  If you want to be a better fingerpicker and improvisational guitarist you cannot do better than to imbibe some of his lessons.  Buy his CDs, see him live if you get the opportunity.  Check out his downloads at LittleTobyWalker.com.
Absolutely incredible arrangements of several great songs; Big Bill Broonzy, Freddie King, Blind Blake, Mississippi John Hurt.  Now, if only Fiona Boyes would put out some lesson packages....",1387670400,2,509,5.3

8475553,5,B005J9ZFA2,"This is a fun DVD lesson from Homespun featuring Toby Walker.  Walker is not only a solid performer, but a gifted teacher who understands some of the limitations experienced by students; especially those who have entered the world of ""Intermediate"" but are fastened tight to the TAB and lost (or at least fearful) as far as straying from the memorized and comfortable path.
As to the camera work, lighting, and visuals, the DVD is of the quality we've come to expect from Homespun.
If you are an acoustic blues player, and have moved beyond the basics and wish to expand away from your comfort zone, this DVD will provide months of inspiring lessons.  Toby Walker's demeanor is easy, humble, and takes backstage to the instruction; something vital in a solid teaching DVD.  ***** Star product and a ***** star teacher.",1332633600,6,818,4.828571428571428
