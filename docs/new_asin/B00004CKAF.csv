1339079,5,B00004CKAF,"""Whistle Down the Wind"" is IMHO one of Hayley Mills' finest film interpretations from her vast film catalogue.  Hayley provides a scintillating performance in a character of youthful innocence in a virtuous and somewhat obscure film.  Will we ever be treated to this exemplary cinematic treasure in Region 1 North America?",1155340800,17,322,5.294117647058823
1339080,4,B00004CKAF,"Stylistically, Whistle Down the Wind treads the centre between the sentimentalism of postwar British cinema and the stark realism of the sixties. The bleak Lancashire countryside is photographed with great ambience by Arthur Ibbetson (The Railway Children, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).
The story has three children discovering ""Jesus"" in their barn, and follows their attempts to keep his presence a secret from the adults. Underneath the events of the film is a journey of faith and doubt and puzzlement. There is a quite deliberate ambiguity, I think, that left me wondering whether the film was cynical or positive about the virtues of childlike faith.
The children turn in believable performances, including Hayley Mills, whose presence works surprisingly well, despite my suspicion that her star persona might add a touch of artifice to the production. The rest of the child cast are made up of real Lancastrian schoolchildren, so the thick northern accents and quaint idioms are all quite genuine.",1065916800,22,1014,5.304347826086956
1339081,5,B00004CKAF,"Alan Bates plays opposite a teenage Hayley Mills in this odd parable about a band of rural English children who mistake a fugitive criminal for the second coming of Jesus Christ.  The indeterminate nature of the ending, which is open to subjective interpretations, makes this a difficult film to pronounce judgement on: non-Christians may not totally get the theological implications, but the dynamic between the aloof, dismissive adult villagers and the flock of children who readily revere the dishelvelled, dangerous Bates is an interesting precursor for the 'Sixties generation gap that was to come.  Beautiful B&W cinematography, and excellent performances by all the child actors, who, amazingly, act like real kids do: petulant, competitive, and able to believe the fantastic.",1052265600,40,783,5.516666666666667
1339082,5,B00004CKAF,This film is excellant. It's quite funny but it's sad as well. It's about three children and one day they find a man in their barn. The man is actually an escaped murderer but they don't know that. When he see's them he shouts out Jesus Christ and they think he's Jesus. I went to the theatre to see it with my parents and my brother. It was brillant.,997574400,32,351,4.101449275362318
1339083,5,B00004CKAF,I had a lot of trouble getting a hold of this film. It was worth it. You can't miss this one. This film taken from the original novel by Mary Hayley Bell. It is the story of 3 children who believe the man that is hiding in their barn is Jesus. This isn't just a children's film. It is a thought provoking film. You have to see it to understand how good it really is. I would recommend that you order the original book from Amazon UK. The book has a slightly different ending. This film has spawned a popular musical and is still popular today. All they have to do now is make the book available in the US. We would also like to see more availability of the video in the NSTC format. The UK also has it available on DVD.,997488000,28,719,4.034965034965035
1339084,5,B00004CKAF,"We actually bought a multi-region DVD player to see the DVD I had purchased, from Germany.  My partner had seen it at a special showing here in San Luis Obispo. CA.  A cool place

So, now after purchasing a DVD and buying it from Germany, I do believe it is a special film.  It was riveting.  Seeing the children tromp over extensive hills and fields.  Their world is gone from many places.  In addition, the children were so rich.
It was wonderful..",1419120000,,450,4.414634146341464
1339085,3,B00004CKAF,"Hayley Mills is spectacular in this, although I felt that the film overall seemed to lack direction",1414540800,,99,4.882352941176471
1339086,2,B00004CKAF,"I really like this movie, I had it on VHS. However when I ordered it on DVD I was not told that I could not play this on my standard DVD player. How was I to know what Region 2 was. Well I found out only after receiving the DVD. It was plainly posted on the DVD wrapper. Why could Amazon not post this when they advertise the DVD. Well my congratulations to your advertising department. They decided to leave this out and it worked, you made your money. I had to return the DVD and you profited because I was charged and I got no DVD. Lesson learned!!!",1410566400,,552,4.073394495412844
1339087,5,B00004CKAF,I love Hayley Mills movies & this is another step closer to owning them all! A great great movie that I am so happy to own now!!!,1408233600,,129,3.814814814814815

1339089,5,B00004CKAF,"Endlessly charming. The young HM before Disneyfication set in.
(For the record, as of this writing, Region 2 or ANY region may be played
painlessly and transparently by the most popular open-source media player.
At this time, that software is called ""VLC"")",1403740800,,256,5.119047619047619
1339090,5,B00004CKAF,"Although I prefer DVD to VHS, this VHS tape was very clean and in XLNT condition.  The film is a little-known British classic, featuring Hayley Mills at her best, and a young Alan Bates in a fine performance.  The  plot  follows a group of children who believe that a stranger hiding out in their barn is Jesus Christ.  Child-like faith in spiritual matters, (as opposed to adult dis-belief and doubt), and  the inevitable punishment that follows crime are the main ingredients in this film.  Good luck in finding a USA-compatible DVD though.",1399680000,2,542,4.826086956521739
1339091,5,B00004CKAF,Thoroughly enjoyed this old movie about the faith of a family of young kids in England during hard times. Very poignant,1388620800,,119,4.714285714285714
1339092,1,B00004CKAF,"I have been out-of-town & did not attempt to play the disc until now.  The disc will not play - it says ""playback prohibited by area limitations.""  I have apparently been completely ripped off.  I've never had a bad experience with Amazon before & was really taken by surprise.  Please tell me if I have any recourse to get a refund from this vendor.",1352592000,3,350,4.421875

1339094,2,B00004CKAF,This was one of my favorite movies but wish I had known before I purchased it that it is not viewable in my region. Ut was my mistake and a costly one.,1347321600,,151,3.75
1339095,1,B00004CKAF,The DVD does not work on Australian equipment therefore total waste of money.  No doubt there is no possibility of ever getting a refund or a replacement.  Guess is just my bad management in ordering.,1347062400,,200,4.685714285714286
1339096,1,B00004CKAF,The dvd sent to me will only work in region 2.  This makes me reluctant to order again as the person sending the product knew where I lived in relation to region and ability to view the dvd.,1346457600,2,190,4.0
1339097,1,B00004CKAF,"I tried to view it. It would not play.  Unarthurized version.. Very dissapointesd. It supposedly came from Movie Mars, Inc. 3837 Bay Lake Trail, suite 115,North Las Vegas 89030. Would like a proper playable version. I am familiar with the movie. I saw it in a theater in 1963.. Would like to share it with my kids....",1339891200,,317,4.56140350877193
1339098,5,B00004CKAF,"This film features Hayley Mills and is based on a story written by her mother, Mary Hayley Bell. The interactions of the children are absolutely typical of kids growing up in post WWII Britain. Even though the premise is silly - children mistaking an escaped criminal for Jesus Christ - its absolutely believable and shows the great screen writing talent of the author. Get this movie and see how things were in pre-Beatles England.",1323302400,5,432,4.851351351351352
1339099,1,B00004CKAF,Was all set to watch this film and realized that playback was prohibited by area limitations. Mainly that it will not play in the USA. Might have been nice to include this information. Or was I expected to travel to another country to play it. Wish I had kept the address.,1320451200,2,272,4.352941176470588
1339100,5,B00004CKAF,"It just amazes me that this isn't in region 1 format.  Fortunately if you have a region-free player, this UK production is very affordable at this time and it INCLUDES SUBTITLES!! A lot of UK discs that I buy don't have them so I was very happy to find this one did.  Not that the English is overly difficult to understand anyway although the provincial British colloquialisms are abundant and made all the more charming by being able to read them as you watch the movie.

As for the movie, it's a very accessable little film that gets you interested in it right away and continues to move at a quick and engaging pace throughout. Simutaneously unaffectedly cute, allegorically profound, and ultimately moving, the film is a masterpiece of cinema both in the story that it tells and in the excellence of direction and cinematography that it employs.  Don't miss this gem from 1961.  It's only special feature (besides English subtitles) is a trailer for the movie.  But the transfer is just great and worthy of purchase if you have the player to watch it on.",1295740800,7,1058,4.661290322580645

1339102,5,B00004CKAF,"I have been looking for a copy of this delightful movie for years and I'm glad to have found it.  It's as good as I remember.  Hoping to see it on DVD sometime soon.  It's a great one to show your kids---or grandkid, too.",1246406400,4,221,3.977272727272727
1339103,4,B00004CKAF,"I have this movie on VHS, are they ever going to print it on DVD region 1 for US players? This is such a good movie that I would like my children to watch. It's a good, clean movie for all ages. Hayley Mills as you know always over-acts her parts, but did a good job in this movie. It's about a little girl that finds a man sleeping in her barn one morning and when she asks him who he is, he is startled by being awakened, and curses by saying ""Jesus"". Thinking this literally, the little girl runs out of the barn before he can explain himself, and assumes he really is Jesus Christ himself. In reality, he's hiding out from the police and was seeking cover from the winters storm in their barn. Very sweet movie about how children believe everything you say, and take things literally. Very good, but I wish they would make this DVD in NTSC Region 1 format for the US people that want to relive those good old days of innocent times. Very highly recommended.",1211846400,,961,4.256830601092896
7919888,5,B00004CKAF,"I bought this. As I bever saw it. I missed a Hayley Millls film. Region 2. Buy Microsoft or movie player apps don't have a distinction of regions. I was able to but this at 19.95. Region 1 issue was 56. Cheaper to buy a universal player.
The film. Dark. Could Hayley Mills be that naive.
But cute to watch. The Murderer did end up being scum. Whichbkeft ne feeling a bit let down.
Watch Moon Spinners. A more exciting film.",1509840000,,423,4.234567901234568
7919889,2,B00004CKAF,"I have been waiting for this movie for years. Saw it as a child and loved it. We order from this seller. The copy sent to me is very poor with continuous tracking and sound problems throughout the entire film.
This seems to have been copied from a VHS or other medium but it is not very good. Can not recommend this at all.
We have invested in an ALL Region DVD player for DVD movies that will not play on Region 1 DVD players. This movie is a ""wonderful gems"" but I have not  been able to find it available in DVD formate for North American DVD players. We will keep on looking for a perfect copy
of this movie.",1502582400,2,612,4.0578512396694215

7919892,5,B00004CKAF,"A very rare movie starring Hayley Mills.  An unusual story about children believing Jesus is hiding in their barn.  Haven't seen this on TV in many decades, so had to buy it.

7919895,5,B00004CKAF,"Unique and cute story with great acting and production.  I don't really have much to add to all the excellent reviews, but one thing I would like to say is that all the one and two star reviews are from people who could not view the movie due to the fact that apparently the Region 2 status was not properly stated on the website when they bought it.  This has been corrected, and there is now a clear warning about this.  I should add that, surprisingly, there is one disturbing scene in which a child almost has his arm broken by an older bully who gets away with it with no consequences.  This is not the type of scene I would want my young children to see.  The only other thing I could criticize is that Hayley Mills was really too old for the part she played - that could be called miscasting, but since her mother wrote the story and Hayley was a big star at the time, what could we expect?",1435276800,,897,4.161849710982659
7919896,1,B00004CKAF,I don't think the website made it really clear it can't be played here.  I'm sending it to England with my sister.,1424563200,,114,4.181818181818182
7919897,5,B00004CKAF,"Bryan Forbes directed, here, his first film; an adaptation, in black and white, of Mary Haley Bell's story of childhood naivet contrasted with adult cynicism.  The screenplay, written by Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse, teeters on the edge of mawkishness at times but just about manages to avoid the kind of sentimentality that mars similar films within this genre.  In this sense it resembles `To Kill a Mockingbird' released a year later.

It features some of the stalwarts of post-war British cinema and Alan Bates delivers a suitably under stated performance as the bearded fugitive, Blakey, the credulous kids mistake for Jesus when they discover him hiding in their barn.  Using kids from the local primary schools of its rural Lancashire setting as `disciples' it successfully juxtaposes their current innocence with the harsh realities of the adult world they've yet to experience as it retells the story of Christ's betrayal and delivery into the hands of the authorities.  In one scene towards the end a `disciple' is bullied into admitting that Blakey isn't really Jesus just before we hear the local train passing by blowing its whistle!

With its wonderfully evocative and now iconic Malcolm Arnold score it's a sheer delight from beginning to end and time machine back to a time that truly, now, seems an age of innocence.",1424044800,,1337,5.054545454545455
