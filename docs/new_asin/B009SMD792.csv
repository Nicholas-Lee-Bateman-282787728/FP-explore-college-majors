5366593,5,B009SMD792,Superb acting. We enjoy each and every title of these extraordinary works and bought the entire collection! The scenery as well as the plots are fabulous. Bruno Cremer brings Maigret to life.....Cremer IS Maigret.,1386633600,2,213,5.294117647058823
5366594,1,B009SMD792,"I love the Maigret stories, have two copies of the long ago released 12-episode set starring Michael Gambon, and am planning to get the newest release of the Gambon episodes, too. If these new stories were only in English, or had English dubbed in, I would have them all and love them, too. But, I cannot enjoy watching a show and reading subtitles at the same time. It gives me a headache and reminds me of work. Plus, since my wife and I have gotten older and our vision isn't as great as it used to be, so we can't really enjoy these shows in French with English subtitles. Please bring them out with English dubbed in or something that allows us to hear the words in English. We feel like we are missing out on a wonderful feast.",1361232000,,733,4.280575539568345

5366596,5,B009SMD792,"Fantastic !! I so enjoy Bruno Cremer ...saw him in the Octopus too..Love the vintage clothes, ambiance  old France.. post war era.  am looking forward to more Maigret..hopefully it won't be long for #7",1356825600,5,201,4.882352941176471
5366597,5,B009SMD792,"Firstly, this DVD set is formatted in Region 1. To all those who do not know, this means that it is meant to be played on a U.S. DVD player, or an international player

Package and Seller: I ordered this set from I-Deals on Amazon Marketplace. To me they have the best prices on these kinds of DVDs (imports). Opening the package, what is contained is the box which you see in the picture, which holds two DVD ""cases"". These cases each contain three discs; Disc 1 contains First-Class Murder, Maigret Sees Double, and Maigret and the Rich. Disc 2 contains Maigret and the Fortune Hunter, My Friend Maigret, and Maigret and the Open Window. Each of these episodes are set on 1 disc each, coming to a total of 6 DVDs. In each case three DVDs are lined up in one holder, something that may or may not be okay with you. I suggest separating these discs into individual containers if you have the chance.

Episodes: This will be a shallow review at first so please bear with me. Each episode depicts Maigret having to solve a case which most often then not includes a murder, and a cast of colorful characters. What makes these mysteries different from U.S. shows and crime dramas? Well, each episode is approximately 90 minutes long. This is much longer than your typical American T.V. show, which is approximately 45 minutes with commercials included in the time frame. These episodes are distributed by MHz Networks, who broadcasts a multitude of International Mysteries, and to my knowledge is a commercial free channel which relies on viewer support and DVD purchases. When you buy the DVDs, each episode will be unedited, so you will get the full story, which is cropped for audiences when it is broadcasted. I will edit this review when I have watched all 6 episodes. If you are wondering about each episode in dept; music, entertainment, depth of mystery; I can say this for certain.....these episodes will keep you entertained for a long time. The plots are very sophisticated each being a whodunit in a traditional sense, but also requiring some level of outside the box thinking required to identify the perpetrator. Keep in mind that by buying these this set, and all other sets, you have a very important tool, the pause button. What makes watching these episodes very enjoyable, (especially on a first-viewing) is that if you feel overwhelmed with something at anytime, you may stop and think about the mystery. It may sound ""dumb"", but to me this is what makes these mysteries fun to watch and enjoy. Nevertheless, after I have watched each episode, I will update this review on how I feel about each episode.

Overall: I am certain that all of these episodes will be fantastic, and am very content with my purchase! If you are tired of shallow- typical mysteries it might be wise to give these a try.",1354665600,10,2811,4.686234817813765
5366598,2,B009SMD792,"pricey especially when subtitles aren't always correct - sometimes sentences are missing, are words are wrong.
don't like the large hardcoded subtitles.
so far DVDs seem to be ok - saw murder in first class and maigret sees double.
