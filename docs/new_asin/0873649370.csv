Being somewhat older and new to shotgun techniques, I learned a lot from this.
However, video is NOT up to current standards and there is mediocre audio quality at times.
Content was useful.",1364601600,,229,5.026315789473684
7793242,5,0873649370,"Louis Awerbuck at his best. Concepts, skills and tactics that are tried and true. Made in 1997 it is still one of the best instructional DVD's out there. Like me you may try other concepts and skills only to find that they are not  all you hoped they would be and return again to this master class in common sense handling of the combat shotgun. It's timeless because what he teaches works and if you ever need to use this weapon a learned skill from this DVD could make your day.",1344816000,4,480,4.274725274725275
