8397354,5,B003IEGNFQ,Good service.  Halarious dvd.,1520553600,,29,6.25
8397355,4,B003IEGNFQ,"I've been looking for the version with Gumby's Christmas sketch on it. This is NOT it. Nevertheless, other, classic Eddie Murphy skits are here. Luckily, I still have my VHS version which has skits that aren't. I rented the DVD with Gumby's Christmas on it, but I have yet been able to find it again. However, these were the days when SNL sketches were often poignant, even profound, Comedy writing ain't what it used to be. This DVD is still well worth the money.",1479859200,,464,4.535714285714286
8397356,1,B003IEGNFQ,I never got the movie set I ordered. I love watching Molly Shannon on snl and that's why I tried to buy this DVD. Things happen. I have watched this DVD before and it was hilarious.,1459555200,,181,4.055555555555555
8397357,1,B003IEGNFQ,"Never received this video. A unrelated single dvd sent instead. Even though I was not charged for this error and allowed to keep the DVD sent, I am disappointed about the mistake..",1374537600,,180,4.65625
8397358,5,B003IEGNFQ,Classic Eddie Murphy from SNL. This movie took me back and had me crying tears when I laughed. 5 stars.,1368576000,,103,4.2
8397359,4,B003IEGNFQ,"Only one Gumby sketch.  No James Brown as Annie, No ""Kill the White People""  Some of the sketches are not Eddie Murphy's Saturday Night Live best.  Some sketches randomly cut short.  Does include ""Cill my landlord!""  Overall, it is a pretty good walk down memory lane.",1298937600,5,268,4.739130434782608
