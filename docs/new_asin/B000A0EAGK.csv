8071004,4,B000A0EAGK,"Black comedy, social commentary, fine acting and the first film appearance by Elvis Costello -- what more could you ask for?

At a mob-owned nightclub in a particularly grotty part of Liverpool, the departing manager goes out with a bang by booking a New Year's party for rival groups of Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants and providing as entertainment a hapless stage magician and a punk band with a pantomime-obsessed lead singer. A party of Alzheimer's patients from the local old age home is thrown in for good measure. The new manager must find a way to keep the night as peaceful as possible, even as the old manager is being beaten by gangsters in the back room.

And so, on a night that's supposed to be about making a fresh start, the Protestants and the Catholics reprise decades-old resentments and triumphs. Tension builds around Billy McCracken, a onetime Protestant tough who wants to turn his back on the old hatreds, and a former Catholic nemesis who's now blind but still tough as hell -- and spoiling for another shot at Billy. The writing (by Alan Bleasdale) is endlessly profane and outrageously funny, and the cast could hardly be better -- particularly Ray McAnally (the father in ""My Left Foot"") as Billy McCracken. The appearance by Joanne Whalley (""Scandal,""The Singing Detective"") doesn't hurt. Costello makes his screen debut as Rosco de Ville, a magician whose act is undermined by the sudden death of his rabbit. You may remember Andrew Schofield, who plays the punk-pantomime-singer, for his turn as Johnny Rotten in ""Sid and Nancy.""

A tough, funny treat that deserves to be rediscovered.",1147219200,,1623,4.937728937728938
