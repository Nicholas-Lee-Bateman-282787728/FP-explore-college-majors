8095245,5,B000C20VI2,"Many programs of the era had their own introductory music and this program was no exception; the music was by Leonard Rosseman.

They always start out with ""staring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow."" Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.

In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?

This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.",1496361600,,803,4.640845070422535

8095253,5,B000C20VI2,"Combat was a staple as I was growing up.  The stories were realistic and gritting, the acting excellent.  Viewers were able to feel empathy for the squad members and looked upon them as role models.  Its wonderful that this ""best of"" series of videos has been released as the cost of the complete set is mostly prohibitive.",1263081600,5,323,4.631578947368421
