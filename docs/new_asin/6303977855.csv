7859260,5,6303977855,"Back in the 1980's my children LOVED these Bible videos.  They are animated stories about 2 children and a robot who go back in time to a specific time/story in the Old Testament.  They stay fairly true to the real account and hold the child's attention.

We ordered these for our grandchildren, and they seem to enjoy them also.  The parents like the VHS format, because the children can put them in themselves, and there is no need to worry about a scratched DVD.",1345075200,,465,4.5
7859261,4,6303977855,"Being raised in the 80s, I was exposed to a number of 'new' formats and settings in television programming, and SuperBook was one of the better ones.  An original premise takes two children, their 'toy' robot, and pet dog, to ancient times to see the unfolding of key happenings in the time and land of the Hebrews.

  I recommend this for teachers and parents as a way to expose children to the events of biblical times before they have the skill and attention span to sit down and read by themselves.  The stories are consistent with the writings (as well as a 20-30 minute cartoon may be), and many of the episodes cover content common to the Christian, Jewish, and Moslem traditions.  This is an excellent way to get children interested in religious history and tradition before they are presented with a Bible or Torah.  At least it worked on me.",1142553600,8,851,4.596026490066225
