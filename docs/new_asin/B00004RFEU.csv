7921196,2,B00004RFEU,"my nine year old did not like the family.  She did not really care about the characters.  She did not like the creepy people, she says they were weird. Not the worst movie she has picked out to watch with me. But close.",1517529600,,219,4.069767441860465
7921197,4,B00004RFEU,"This was one of those old B-rated movies that you would randomly pick up at the video store and kick back with some friends.

back in the late 90's/early 00's, I used to watch this movie over and over with my friends during the summer.
it was genuinely creepy at the time, maybe not so much now given the higher standards in film.

it's one of those sleeper movies, no one has ever heard of it and no one will ever tell you about it.

but trust me, it is fairly good and it's worth at least one viewing!

still not convinced?

maybe you would feel better picking this up if you knew that you can compare this with Body Snatchers meets the Wild West.

furthermore, the main character in this movie was the same actor that played the main character in the old Bonechillers videos. if you enjoyed watching those old tapes, you'll like this movie too.",1338336000,,847,4.329113924050633
7921198,4,B00004RFEU,"This family wound up in a town with zombie like people.  The kids parents came up missing, and they went there to find them.  They noticed that everyone kept behaving in the same manner.  The people seemed without emotions.  They went to the desk clerk who always insisted they sign the visitor book.  Luckily, they held out a little longer from doing this.  If one signs the visitor book, let's just say, trouble will insure.

When my kids were younger, we liked the movie except my son who hadn't watched it.  Sure it was a bit silly, but we had fun watching it.  Our favorite part was the ending.  I use to rewind the tape over and over for us to watch and laugh at that ending again and again. For a fun ride, watch with the kids and enjoy.",1276300800,,744,4.25
7921199,2,B00004RFEU,"This movie was better then 'Aliens in the Wild Wild West', which also starred young Taylor Locke (who looks and acts exactley the same in both movies) but that still doesn't make it good. The script was cheesy, the acting was weak, and the story was unoriginal. But some parts I found funny and sometimes even creepy. I think little kids would like this movie but don't expect anyone older to enjoy it.",1092355200,,402,4.52054794520548
