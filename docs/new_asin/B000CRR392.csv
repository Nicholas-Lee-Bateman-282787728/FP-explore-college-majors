2472378,2,B000CRR392,"Yep, you can see by the cover picture that this only has six games: the two clinchers and the four WS games. Nice that Boston gets 11 games for their box set and we get only 6. No respect. Absolutely none. Every game the Sox won (except the first ALDS game) was close and had compelling storylines. This means we won't get the AJ ""dropped third"", the 1st-inning homers in consecutive games by Konerko in the ALCS, and many other great moments. I'll still buy this, but I will always be disappointed.",1137628800,13,499,4.434782608695652
2472379,5,B000CRR392,"This is a must have for every White Sox fan and for that matter, every baseball fan. The White Sox showed the world what a great team they were in 2005 overcoming skeptics who waited for them to collapse. By winning the WS, the SOX took back the city of Chicago as the most popular and exciting team to watch and are again Chicago's team. This group of players along with Manager Ozzie Guillen won the hearts of baseball fans everywhere.",1137196800,8,437,4.407407407407407
2472380,5,B000CRR392,"I have found out through some web searching that this set will contain 7 DVDs which will contain the 4 World Series games against the Astros, plus the series clinching games against the Red Sox and the Angels for a total of 6 games.  I assume the 7th disc will contain bonus material.

It would have been nice to have all 12 games in the White Sox' run (or at least the 11 victories), since the two clinching playoff games were on the road, but I assume the DVD producers don't think the market justifies such a set given that the World Series had a low viewer rating.  But it should be a great addition to a White Sox fan's video library!",1136851200,28,639,4.221311475409836

2472382,5,B000CRR392,"I have been a White Sox fan since the Go-Go Sox in the 50's. On my 30-40 minute commute on the way home that Friday afternoon, I was listening to the game. Freddy Garcia gave up a leadoff home run to Manny Ramirez and Damaso Marte proceeded to load the bases with Red Sox. I got home just in time to watch Orlando Hernandez retire the side without allowing a single run. To me, the highlight of this disc set is the bottom of the 6th inning in game three of the divisional playoff. I have watched that inning several times and little else. If only, the post game interview with El Duque sitting back, like he just saved the world (he did),enjoying a cigar, Ozzie Guillen, Jr., or was it Oney, translating, was included in the highlight disc. The debate about who should have been left off the roster, El Duque or Brandon McCarthy, was over.",1180224000,4,840,4.356687898089172
2472383,5,B000CRR392,I thought the 2005 World Series Collector's Edition was really terrific.  I enjoyed every second of it.  It really caught all the emotion and suspense of four great ball games.  This is one I will be watching over and over again.  Anyone who is a fan of baseball and particularly a fan of the Chicago White Sox will want to have this collector's edition.  The 2005 World Series was a great one.,1168905600,2,394,4.416666666666667

He has watched the whole thing already since Christmas and will watch it many times over again to re-live the whole thrill.  Much better than the ones we taped at home, all the extras are so nice to have too.  Let's do it again in 2007!",1168819200,,337,3.911764705882353
2472385,4,B000CRR392,"Others have done a good job reviewing this but I wanted to add something.  As previously mentioned, all games are presented in widescreen format.  Since the games were broadcast in HD, why not release one SD set with the games in full screen format and one HD set with the games in widescreen?  The widescreen format bugged me at first, but my eyes adjusted and I was fine.  Bottom line, this is a worthy addition to your DVD library.",1165449600,,434,4.455696202531645
2472386,4,B000CRR392,"I thought the video was well done.  It was good to feature the clinching

games of the Division and League Championship Series plus all four games

of the World Sries.  I think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series against

Boston and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series against

Los Angeles.  Still, I highly recommend this collection for all gung-ho

2472387,4,B000CRR392,"No matter if you have known it all your life, the last time the Chicago White Sox won the World Series was in 1917, and the last time they were in the World Series was 1959, that is until 2005, when the White Sox became the surpise hottest team in the American League, but since the American League team won the All-star game in 05, like they have since the rule, had been put in effect that the side that wins the All-star game will get to have homefield advantage in the World Series, no matter which 2 teams make it. And who would have believed that it would have been the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros that went up for the championship. This was also the first time the Chicago White Sox made the playoffs since 2000, when they played the Seattle Mariners, and was swept in the first round of the playoffs. The Chicago White Sox met the Boston Red Sox for the ALDS, and I didn't even think the Chicago White Sox will be able to even beat the Red Sox, but they did, and they completed the sweep at Fenway Park in game 3. And then that waited for the winner of the Los Angeles Angles and New York Yankes winner, and it went to where, the winner wasn't even going to get a day off. And the Angles won the series, and for the first time since 2002, there was no Boston Red Sox or New York Yannkees meeting up for the trip to the World Series. The well rested Chicago White Sox lost to the tired Angles (thier only loss in the whole post season). The White Sox won it in 5 games, and now it was down to the St. Louis Cardinals and Hosuston Astros, the Cardinals were bidding farewell to old Busch Stadium, but lost the Astors, and Busch Stadiume was closed, set to be delmoished. This is were he get all 4 games, including the marathon game #3, thqat the White Sox won the game in 5 hours and 41 minutes, long after it hit midnight, and shortly after 1 in the morning. The White Sox copmpleted the sweep later on that night. Games #1 and 2 took place at US Cellular Field in Chicago, and then the scene swifted to Minute Maid Park in Houston for games #3 and 4. Now I woulkd have thought it would have been a perfect farewell to the old Busch Stadium, if the Cardinals and White Sox met up for the World Series, but that didn't happen.",1155600000,,2241,4.1658986175115205
2472388,5,B000CRR392,"This DVD collection is a must have for any White Sox fan.  You will get all of the World Series games to relive the glory of 2005.

Unlike the other team in Chicago who plays AAA ball 8.3 miles up north and who will never taste the thrill of victory...well, at least those fans can buy this excellent DVD collection and know what it's like to win it all.

CUB FANS: 1908 AND STILL COUNTING!!!!

It's not, ""Wait Until Next Year"", it's ""Wait Until The Next Century""...maybe, just maybe (but, I highly doubt it) they might win it in 2108!

2472390,2,B000CRR392,"I was pretty pumped to get the DVD collection of my beloved White Sox World Series run. I was dismayed to find out that the collection would not include all post season games. One of the games not included is a fairly memorable game Game 2 of the ALCS vs the Angels that had the much discussed incident with A.J. Pierzynski.

Putting aside the missing games I horrified when I put the first disk in. Contrary to what I have read in other reviews, this is NOT an anamorphic widescreen transfer. The games were broadcast in 16:9 high definition so I cannot understand why the DVDs were not transfered this way. The DVDs are presented in a 4:3 letterboxed format. I found the games difficult to watch like this. If you don't have a high definition television then maybe this will not be an issue, but if you DO have a HD set (the only way to watch sports in my opinion) you will be disappointed.",1150329600,4,892,4.373493975903615
2472391,4,B000CRR392,"For those of you who don't think Wal-Mart is ""taking over the world""  ;o)  You can get this set at Sam's Club for $39.99!  I picked it up there for my son, and was glad to see all the positive reviews - being the die-hard Chi-Sox fan that he is, I know he's going to enjoy this one . . . and I don't think he'll mind the fact that it doesn't include ""all the games"".  18+ hours of viewing pleasure s/b satisfactory.",1147305600,,415,3.963855421686747
2472392,1,B000CRR392,"it's nice to get the world series complete games, but how come we (white sox) fans don't get all alcs games , are we not long-suffering enough. this is a slap in the face to all sox (white) fans. we have had to wait much longer and go through more bad years then boston did. at least boston has gone to the series a couple of times in the last 30 years. we (chisox) have not even come close to the series since 1959. they talk about the curse of the bambino. what about the curse of the 1919 black sox? mlb and a&e video have done a nasty thing by puting the red sox world series victory above the white sox world series victory instead of treating them both with equality. still worth buying but what else do we have to choose from?",1145404800,5,733,4.097222222222222
2472393,5,B000CRR392,"I would recommend this purchase. It contains the clinchers of both the ALDS and ALCS, along with the four World Series games. I have waited since the final out of the October classic for the release, and it's worth it. I got to relive all the moments that I will cherish for years to come.

If I had any complaints, they would come from the first disc, against the Boston Red Sox. The quality of that is slightly lacking with green specs occassionally, including the famous bottom of the 6th inning. It's not enough to get frustrated over, but I did find it bothersome that this was in the way. Also, the MLB logo is in the left bottom corner in each game, and though it annoyed me at first, my vision adjusted accordingly to phase it out of my mind. Each game is wide screen. I also noticed in the game 3 marathon, that they cut a short bit out of the broadast to perhaps cut time. The pitching count was still the same in between them, so they might've cut it out due to time constraints. You'd have to pay close attention to catch this, and it's in extra innings.  That DVD was 4 hours and 20 minutes long.

The bonus DVD was interesting, though shorter than I was expecting (58 minutes). I wish they released this a month later so they could've added the ring ceremony, as the other World Series have. But overall I thank A&E and hope they continue this trend for years to come. World Series are special events that provide memories for everyone baseball fan. I was honored my city got to play in one in my lifetime.",1144195200,5,1520,4.326315789473684
2472394,5,B000CRR392,"I found out about this release months ago and was waiting for it ever since

Of course Iam from CT so stupid best buy didn't order any copies so I ordered it online

Any way this set contains 7 dvd's

Game 3 At Fenway Park clinching the Division Series

Game 5 Vs The Angels to Clinch the Pennant

Game 1 World Series in Chicago

Game 2 World Series in Chicago

Game 3 World Series in Houston

Game 4 World Series in Houston

Bonus Dvd  The bonus dvd is very similar to the other pre released whitesox world series dvd but has some comments on the players in what they were feeling in certain games and cituations they show some of the parade through chicago

My only concern was why we didn't get every game of the playoffs like stupid boston did

Baseball is to commercial jsut because our ChiSox is not some stupid big market team we don't get everygame !!!!!!! of course you know boston and new york do

Any way this is definitly a must to show your children in years to come what you went through and witnessed as a ChiSox fan go out and get this box set what r u waiting for?",1144022400,4,1081,4.164251207729468
2472395,4,B000CRR392,"What else can I say that I haven't already said about the 2005 World Champion White Sox?  This is a wonderful 7-DVD box set featuring all four complete World Series games, the complete clinchers from the ALDS (including the stunning bases-loaded, no outs performance by El Duque in the bottom of the sixth, in its entirety!) and AL Championship Series and a nice bonus disc with extended player interviews, locker room championship celebration and footage from the championship parade in downtown Chicago.  DVD menus are easy to follow and allow the viewer to go directly to whichever half inning they choose (great for zooming right to those incredible moments occuring throughout the Series) in addition to viewing each game in its entirety.  I also enjoyed the statistical and trivia information provided with each DVD slim case.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the games (although complete) do not feature any of the pre-game ceremonies (it would have really been nice to have the late, great Lou Rawls performing the National Anthem before Game #2, not to mention the Latino Legends festivities before Game #4, although there are some brief highlights from that in the MLB World Series DVD) and post-game coverage is pretty much limited to what aired before the first commercial break.  Finally we have to endure play-by-play from Chris Berman in the ALDS (he wasn't cheering TOO much for the Red Sox, was he?) and the team of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver for the ALCS and World Series (way too much time bellyaching over alleged ""missed calls"" and they seemed to be leaning towards Houston with their play-by-play and analysis).  Despite these flaws this is a prized collectible no White Sox fan should be without.",1143763200,,1743,4.91156462585034

- Full coverage of clinching Game 5 vs. Anaheim in ALCS

- All 4 World Series games agains Astros

- Footage of locker room celebration, victory parade, and division clinching win in Detroit

The production values of this set are outstanding; each DVD is individually packaged in a slim DVD case.  The outside of the case contains game stats (attendance, length of game, box score, etc.) and trivia, while the inside of the case has game recaps.  The DVDs themselves are arranged with every half-inning as a ""chapter"", so you can browse to the bottom of the 6th against Boston with ease at any time.  The packaging and production of the DVDs is first rate.

The only ""complaint"" that I have is that it really is less intense when you know what's going to happen, but every true Sox fan needs this set; it really blows grainy Tivo footage out of the water.",1143676800,6,933,4.505952380952381
2472397,5,B000CRR392,"I was in awe when I saw that this was being released.  It is unprecedented to get an official release of entire games, an entire World Series, and even two additional games (including the wonderful El Duque inning).  I'm afraid us Sox fans are so used to playing 2nd fiddle that we're thinking everything is an injustice.  The Red Sox set NEEDED the ALCS, as that was far more thrilling than the actual World Series (aside from them actually winning it of course).  And it costs more, too.  This set does need to include a section on the A.J. incident.  And the broadcast by Rooney and Farmer would be wonderful.  But we should relish this set for what it is, not what it isn't.  Now for years to come we can refer people to this set to have them check it out for themselves.",1142467200,8,775,4.333333333333333
2472398,4,B000CRR392,"After 88 years of waiting, how much more expensive would it have been to include all the post-season games on this box set?  The games you are leaving out included some of the most thrilling post-season baseball moments of all time, including the A.J. dropped third strike and for Chicago fans, being able to watch the first ALCS games in 22 years and first World Series games in 46 years to be played in the city.

I HIGHLY suggest they release a Volume II with all the other post-season games.  I will still buy this because as a die-hard Sox fan, I buy any and everything commemorating the World Series Victory.",1142380800,9,614,4.513513513513513
2472399,4,B000CRR392,"All this talk about an east coast bias, if you looked at the yankee box set they released, they only had 5 games. The Red Sox one is so overpriced because of all the games on it AND that entire series had some of the most classic games in playoff history. For the other world series DVD's they have the entire world series and it's not A&E's fault the chi sox swept that series. They're not just selling to the fans of the team, they're trying to sell the DVD to Schmoes like me who are sports fans in general, and I would buy this DVD because it's not outrageous and there's some very good baseball on the set.

That Mets one looks tasty too. Buckner baby.",1141603200,5,657,4.173228346456693

It took the White Sox 88 years since their last World Series win in 1917, yet the ""boxed set"" contains only 6 of the 12 total games played. What kind of ""boxed set"" is this????

I videotaped all the games along with the pre and post game shows. This will be my ""boxed set"".

My DVD's also have all the pre-game and post-game stuff and no commercials. I recorded Comcast's parade coverage, ABC channel 7's parade coverage, each game of the World Series, ALCS, and ALDS, so that's better than THIS collection. So, how are the ones I have compared to this collection? As I have discussed on the White Sox fan forum message board, much better.

8101563,5,B000CRR392,"I bought this on May 14, 2007 when I was still on deployment overseas. I was about a month away from leaving that hell hole and decided to pick this up since I'm a huge White Sox fan win or lose. I was also deployed the day that they won the series. I did however catch the final inning live so I was happy to at least view it live, since I would go on missions lasting 3-5 days at a time, but I digress.

I paid $34.99 when I bought this over 7 years ago. I'm sort of ashamed that it's sitting here at my computer desk still sealed. The cover doesn't even look like the one in the amazon photo, it looks totally different. I'm not sure if there was a refresh of the DVD or Amazon's photo is wrong, but it's different. While on missions I was able to catch a glimpse of a game while at the chow hall, but could not sit and watch unfortunately.

I don't even want to open it. I do want to watch it so maybe I'll order another copy since it's still the same price, or pick up a used copy just to watch it and maybe be buried with this sealed copy (just kidding of course).

After being a die hard Sox fan for 40 years watching them master this playoff run was a truly remarkable event. In regards to the quality of the disks the games are shown in their entirety with flawless DVD quality. Note that I use an up conversion DVD player. The key final games to the first two series are included and all of the games from the world series with the exception of the one we lost. The set also includes the parade.

I had no idea the Sox won the series until our drill instructor told us during mail call. I sure picked a great time to go to boot camp. Everytime I watch this, I must admit, I get depressed - just cuz I couldn't be there or see it. It must've been awesome. But I bought this to make up for not seeing it, and it's great. It doesn't have all the games, just the ALDS clincher, the ALCS clincher and all four WS games. Plus, an Extras DVD and highlight DVD. There's options where you can pick which inning you want to watch...and tons of stats on the outside and inside of the cover, including each at-bat. This is a must have for every Sox fan. I think the DVD's are made for HD. I have a cheap hajji TV here in Iraq and the picture still comes out great. It's pretty clear and is like watching HD, w/o the HDTV. The only con is that it is widescreen. But I have an option on my XBox360 to zoom into the picture so it comes out ok. But yeah, I love this collectors set. I watch it all the time. Especially the grand slam by Konerko in game 2. That must've been nuts. It's also fun to re-live the memories of that year, now that the Sox suck this year and all. I was also in Iraq for the Bears Super Bowl and missed that too. I'm just having bad luck.
