8388991,5,B0035GBAXM,"Prof. Tyson is the best lecturer I have ever heard. He also was the first American to receive the Stephen Hawking prize for excellence in scientific writing. Prof. Tyson pulls a lot of scientific ideas together - astronomy, physics, astrophysics, chemistry, and biology - to explain our universe clearly. Amazing! I enjoyed his coursebook as well as the DVD.",1504828800,,358,5.084745762711864
8388992,5,B0035GBAXM,"Another one of my favorite courses.
Neil is amazing. You might of seen him on the Cosmos reboot.  This is similar, but focused on some of his favorite aspects of the universe.

Highly recommended.",1496102400,,196,4.735294117647059
8388993,5,B0035GBAXM,"This is very interesting.  Professor Tyson explains things in layman's terms so it is understandable. Would recommend to anyone willing to learn about our wonderful universe.  The more you know, the more you understand how small we really are.",1429747200,2,243,5.205128205128205
8388994,5,B0035GBAXM,Excellent all the way around. I would buy from them again. Very satisfied overall.,1414713600,,82,4.928571428571429
8388995,5,B0035GBAXM,"I keep running in to Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson in many other presentations and books. I also own several ""The Great Courses"" with several more on my ""to purchase"" stack.

What makes this interesting is his presenting style. While other people make soundbite presentations Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson makes contagious sense and seems to be the only person confident in what he is presenting.

As I watch the presentation I keep the Grate Courses pamphlet to look up supplementary information as I go. I also keep a physics made simple book for the few definitions not in the supplement. Even though the presentation is very fundamental he assumes that you already have some basic knowledge of physics as he is describing his favorite universe.

The DVD version has two DVD's. The lecture is split up into four topics and twelve lectures.

You will find this a fun way to pass time and maybe pick up a little universal knowledge.",1405296000,2,933,4.849056603773585
8388996,5,B0035GBAXM,"I watched a few of these episodes on youtube before they were removed and wanted to complete the series, sadly the only copy I found was over 100 dollars until I saw this. Great buy for anyone interested in general topic discussion about the cosmos.",1390608000,3,249,4.555555555555555
