7827582,3,6302561922,"THE ETERNAL TRAMP (aka ""Chaplinesque, My Life and Hard Times"") (1972) is in newspaper lingo a ""puff piece.""

Charlie Chaplin's entire pre-Hollywood life is covered in about 3 minutes without mention of family. Nor are his many co-stars discussed or even named. Film clips are taken from a handful of SENNETT, ESSANAY and MUTUAL shorts. Chaplin's later classics are laundry-listed with a single photo or movie poster repro each. After this, the previously seen shorts are excerpted again for ""an examination of Charlie the tramp"" which simply states the obvious.

Gloria Swanson is an able narrator stuck with copy that's pure fan worship. An annoying solo piano plays throughout. As documentaries go, this one's rather weak.

As of 2/09, ""Eternal Tramp"" was not available on DVD.

Recommended:  THE CHAPLIN REVUE (1959) is a highlight film assembled by Sir Charles himself. Silent era clips are shown in REAL time rather than the super-fast exaggeration caused by running them at 24 fps.
