5117945,5,B0081HLM2E,"I had been eagerly awaiting the film adaptations of Jo Nesbo's books and was surprised when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HEADHUNTERS-by-Jo-Nesbo-Author-on-Sep-06-2011-Paperback/dp/B008KTYLZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HEADHUNTERS by Jo, Nesbo (Author) on Sep-06-2011 Paperback</a>&nbsp;was chosen as the first to make it to the silver screen. This was an excellent interpretation and, as other have said, once the initial 25 or so minutes are through, establishing the real Roger Brown, the film matches the break-neck chain of events as Roger's world unravels in seemingly unconnected incidents.

All acting is truly superb, but especially that of Aksel Hennie in the lead role. The scene when he starts piecing the situation together in the river is particularly moving. It is so much better and believable than the usual unbelievable ""victim suddenly becomes hero"" turnaround that we get with Hollywood movies.

Yes, the film omits a few elements of the book, such as the nature of the relationship between Clas and Lotte, and speeds through others, but the overall storyline is kept true.

Overall a great film that will have you on the edge of your chair, even without having read the book.

One personal recommendation - watch it in the original Norwegian with English subtitles. The voices that were chosen to dub this into American simply do not fit the characters.",1345939200,,1419,5.742857142857143

5117947,5,B0081HLM2E,"I love mystery and suspense and this film has both. It's bloody and violent and sometimes humorous. You keep thinking ""how can this guy's day get any worse?"" And it does.

Roger Brown is Norway's most successful headhunter, but that doesn't pay for the lifestyle he thinks he needs to keep his gorgeous wife, Diana. The unscrupulous Brown finances his extravagance by way of dangerous art thefts. When he meets Dutchman Clas Greve he sees the chance to become financially independent and starts planning his biggest heist ever. His usual crimes are nonviolent but in a day that goes from bad to worse, Roger's comfortable lifestyle is destroyed and he finds himself running for his life.

Hollywood will probably come out with its own version of this film, but see this one first.",1344643200,,780,4.857142857142857
5117948,5,B0081HLM2E,"Quite simply, this is a quintessential cinematic thriller brilliantly executed.  Everything about this Norske import reeks of drama, tension, passion, and excitement; and some of it smells of sweet absurdity.

The creators of the script and executors of the film never lost sight of what is the ultimate goal of any movie:  Entertainment!
Almost every second of this movie propels the story forward in such a way that the viewer becomes entirely enamored of this story, and the action propelling it is so frenetic and compelling that it pulls all manner of reaction from its audience from lust, to ridicule, to shock, to revulsion, to laughter, to admiration all of which keep one riveted to the screen.  For nobody wishes to miss a single second of this action-packed mystery thriller.

I'm not going to give the plot away, likely other reviewers have done this for you, other to say that this is an action-packed mystery thriller that throws in all of the elements that Hollywood deems necessary for a successful action-packed mystery thriller and does it in such a cleverly nonchalant self-conscious way that one is charmed in the very process of identifying it all (gratuitous breast, impossible action, vulgar sexual content--a peculiarity of contemporary Norwegian film, incidentally--, blood and gore, right down to a trite romantic interlude).

Yes, all of the Hollywood cliche strings are tossed in front of the audience and amazingly none of them are left dangling untied at the end of the show.

If, at the very end of this movie, you don't have a huge grin of satisfaction on your face, you aren't a sentient being, my friend.",1342224000,2,1638,4.978021978021978
5117949,4,B0081HLM2E,"This one is a killer-diller! Wow! The person who recommended this one to me deserves a medal. Hodejegerne, an R-rated Norwegian crime thriller (English captions), is exciting, involving, unpredictable and intelligent. It has relatable characters, a wonderful plot and is beautifully acted. We in the audience left the theater happily talking to ourselves.

A skilled art thief hears of a priceless Rubens, stolen during WWII and kept in a private collection all these years. He realizes this could be the deal that puts him and his wife on easy street for the rest of their lives. Thus begins our story.

We see:
  * Aksel Hennie (""Age of Heroes"") is our pint-sized cat burglar, impeccably groomed, smart as a whip and always trying to improve his theft of high-end art. His day job is to find and interview applicants for new executive positions.
  * Synnve Macody Lund (TV roles) is his statuesque wife, blonde, successful and longing to have a baby. She owns an art gallery.
  * Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Game of Thrones"") is a former hi-tech special ops guy who wants the job as CEO of a company our hero represents. He has come to Norway to settle his aunt's estate.
  * Eivind Sander (""Cupid's Balls"") is our hero's fence and inside man for those pesky burglar alarms. Problem is, he rarely uses the brain in his big head. He and his libido entertain thousands on the Internet.
  * Reidar Srensen (""Home for Christmas"") is the brilliant and politically astute detective who gets involved in the situation.

This fast-moving plot sucks you in before you know it. There is tension, surprise, and impressive use of modern technology: GPS, cell phones and the Internet. Expect guns, knives, cars, trucks, attack dogs, and a farm tractor, plus a couple of really gross bits. There is little or no profanity or blowie uppie stuff. The two antagonists are Norwegian versions of the Energizer Bunny: they just won't quit! And I LOVE watching smart people try to outwit other smart people.

This comes out on DVD at Amazon on 08-28-12. Brace yourself!",1341014400,29,2046,4.858789625360231
5117950,4,B0081HLM2E,"Headhunters (Hodejegerne) is a taut Norwegian-German thriller that, in its best parts, is reminiscent in style not only of the Coen brothers but also of Alfred Hitchcock as well.  Directed by Morten Tyldum and adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg from the novel by Jo Nesb, Headhunters starts off casually with what seems to be an art thief explaining why he does what he does.  But just when you think you know what's going on and where things are heading, the film starts taking one unexpected turn after another, methodically ratcheting up the tension and the stakes, until you, like the art thief, are wondering just what the hell you've gotten yourself into.

Set in current-day Oslo, Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is one of the top professional headhunters in Norway, assisting top-name companies find the very best in executive talent.  It's a good job and it pays well, but unfortunately not well enough to support the extravagant lifestyle Roger lavishes on himself and on his wife of seven years, Diana (Synnve Macody Lund).  Which is why Roger is also one of the top art thieves in Norway; he needs the money to keep up the lifestyle that his regular job cannot support.  He freely acknowledges, in his inner narrative to the audience, that he's probably compensating for the fact that he's short (1.68m or 5'6"") and ordinary-looking where his wife is tall and beautiful.  And because of his insecurities, he's constantly giving her expensive gifts - like financing the new art gallery she's opening - but stubbornly ignoring the one thing she really wants from him: a child.  But at the same time he's also having an affair with a woman named Lotte (Julie lgaard).  He knows it's probably a bad idea, but his doubts about his wife's love leave him in need of still further validation.

Fortunately for Roger, his work with top-name companies and high-level executives is always bringing him into contact with the kind of people who like to indulge in expensive art, so he is able to use his day job to find suitable targets for his secret sideline.  He also has a valuable if distinctly unrefined partner named Ove Kjikerud (Eivind Sander) who works for the home-security company that most people use and who can enable him to get in and out of the target houses without triggering the alarms. The pressure of maintaining this lifestyle, however, is enormous, and so Roger must constantly pull one job after another, pointing out how the theft he pulls off early in the film won't even cover this month's mortgage payment on his expensive house once the middlemen take their cut and his partner Ove gets his cut. So he's excited when a juicy double-plum suddenly drops right into his lap.

Roger's current big client is a hi-tech security company called Pathfinder who is looking for a new CEO.  And so when, at his wife's gallery opening, she introduces him to a man named Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), he quickly realizes that Clas, a former special forces commando and security expert who until just recently was working as an executive for Pathfinder's biggest rival, is the perfect match for the job.  And when he finds out that Clas is apparently in possession of a lost Rubens - a painting potentially worth millions - Roger sees the answer to all of his financial problems.

But then things start to go wrong.  And then more wrong.  And then horribly, horribly wrong.

(Note:  I'm trying to avoid any major spoilers, but there are a few potential ones in this paragraph.)
When Roger slips into Clas' apartment to get the Rubens, he makes a discovery that throws his entire world into disarray.  Which provokes him into a fit of pique and makes him sabotage Clas' chances for the Pathfinder CEO job.  Which somehow triggers something and the next thing he knows he's finding an apparently dead body in his car, and then he's running for his life, thinking Clas must've realized he'd stolen the Rubens... only to discover that Clas isn't after the Rubens at all.  And at every turn, people around him are either getting killed, or trying to kill him, or both.

The performances are all top notch, from Aksel Hennie's outwardly super-confident but inwardly insecure Roger to Eivind Sander's clownishly crude Ove who obsesses over the Russian prostitute he spends all of his money on and who uses security cameras in his house to let his buddies at the security company watch some of the fun now and then.  Synnve Macody Lund's Diana is layered, leaving the audience as well as Roger wondering what she knows and whose side she is truly on. Julie lgaard's Lotte turns on a dime, going from earthy erotic to neurotically needy to the completely unexpected as her character's role in the drama changes.  The standout performance though comes from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known to English-speaking audiences as the casually amoral and dangerous Jamie Lannister from the Game Of Thrones TV mini-series.  In Headhunters, Coster-Waldau's Clas is charming from the beginning, but even then you can sense that beneath that charm is something else, something calculating and, as events begin to unfold, tenacious, controlled and deadly.

It's the cat-and-mouse game between Roger and Clas that really rivets you, heightened by Hennie's bringing out Roger's increasing fear, confusion and desperation while Coster-Waldau reveals the relentless dispassionate predator in Clas.  The tension just keeps getting racheted up higher and higher, with Clas resorting to more and more extreme measures to get Roger and Roger resorting to equally extreme measures to survive.  Tyldum does an excellent job with the pacing and with the twists and turns in the plot that keep you guessing as to what will happen next and how things will finally be resolved.  Stylistically, a lot of Headhunters reminded me of films by the Coen brothers where all of the details matter and how actions can have the most unintended consequences.  It also reminded me a lot of Hitchcock in the way that his protagonists often got swept up in events where they must struggle to find out what's going on even as they try to stay alive.

My only real complaint about Headhunters is that I felt the ending wrapped things up just a little too neatly to be believable, and that the characters who survive at the end got off way, way too lightly.  One of the things I like about the Coen brothers' films is that no matter what the game is or how it ends, nobody gets to walk away with all of the chips.  Headhunters could have used a bit of that philosophy.  If I could've rated it four-and-a-half stars I would've, but the too-neat ending kept me from giving it the full five.

But that aside, Headhunters is a really well-done thriller that keeps the tension and the stakes mounting higher and higher almost to the very end.  Highly recommended.",1339545600,4,6826,4.838349097162511

As a Jo Nesbo fan, I eagerly anticipated the release of the first film I
have found based on one of his books..While the film is wonderfully done,
reading the book first was essential to maximizing the enjoyment of the
film..The texture and fun of the book could not be reproduced..There are
just too many ironies and false leads to capture in the time alloted..

The author chooses to fool the reader of the book, at least for awhile..
Those watching the film can not really imagine all of the plot..What
makes most of the action piece together, at least for the bulk of the
story, has to be spilled within less than 30 seconds of dialogue as one
of the villans, a surprise in itself, tells her understanding of a complex
and twisting plot as she confronts the ""hero"" before a struggle to the
death..Most of what is revealed during this dialogue has been explored in
depth to the reader, but just at a glimpse to the viewer..I doubt most of
those in the theatre got a keen grasp of that plot revelation, but the
pace and fun and gore of the film makes for a memorable moviegoing time,
nevertheless..But fun is fun, even if only on the surface of a story much
more entertaining to digest slowly, like a great meal served on the page..

The fact that our ""hero"" has shrewdly set up a solution to be grasped and
exploited by a greasy media type drowning in his own narcissism to present
to the public a contrived and false explanation of many of the homicides
which pop up along the way is again a gem to read about as our ""hero"" is
removed from both suspicion and prosecution for the mess he has created..
The moviegoers would find the scenes themselves both entertaining and
part of the resolution of the story, but without the deliciousness of the
irony and dark humor that Jo Nesbo has delightfully sent our way, and to
my thinking, beyond what can be seen on the screen..

Sorry to be so obscure, but I do not wish to give anything away..To those
who read first and then watch the story on the screen, the movie is a gem;
to those unfamiliar with the book, the movie is fun and worth the time,
but a much more shallow experience..After reading, one asks: ""How on earth
are they going to show us this episode??"" That made the movie exceptional..",1339459200,8,2386,4.70334928229665
5117952,4,B0081HLM2E,"Headhunters (2011 release from Norway; 100 min.) brings the tale of 5ft7 (not tall enough? just watch the movie!) Roger Brown, who is in the recruiting business (hence the movie's title), but in order to keep up his lavish life style and to continually impress his impossibly beautiful wife Diana, Roger has a side business of sorts: he, with the aide of a side kick, steals valuable art from people's homes, to sell it on the black market. All goes well until at some point Roger meets Dutch business man Clas Greve. Clas has an interesting background and might fit the profile for the CEO position that Roger's headhunting agency is trying to fill. On top of that, Clas' grandmother, who just passed away in Oslo, apparently has some extremely valuable art in her private collection...

The above is the basic premise of the movie, and to give away much more would flat-out ruin your viewing experience. Suffice it to say that not everything is what it seems to be. From the movie's beginning, the pace is relentless, and I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie (as were most of the fellow theatre visitors I saw it with this past weekend). Indeed, there is hardly any ""down"" time in the movie, because once the basic premise of the movie is set, we fall from one surprise into the next, without it being ""over the top"" or implausible.

When this movie came out in Norway last year, it immediately was a box office smash, and that success was later repeated in many European countries. Now it's finally in the US, and by all means it should do well here to. Even though it was made in a different country than the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, ""Headhunters"" definitely has a similar feel about it, albeit never quite as dark as the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. In all, this movie has been one of the best surprises for me among the theatre movie releases I've seen so far in 2012. If you like a clever and exciting foreign action thriller, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Headhunters"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1337472000,93,2007,4.556786703601108

5117977,3,B0081HLM2E,"Hey, aren't those Scandinavian countries, you know Norway, Denmark, Sweden, maybe Finland on an off day supposed to be socially progressive, socially useful, laid back societies that everybody in the West throws up as an example, good or bad, of  what a society should like. Well, what is up lately with those ultra-violent Dragon Tattoo films and now this Norwegian-Danish thriller, Headhunters, where the blood and gore would make even lowly Hollywood B-film producers blush.

Here is what made my hair stand on end quite a bit, made me glad I lived in a civilized in your face, no questions asked violent society rather than those hidden cesspool social democracies where not all is what it seems to be. Heck the film started out simply enough with our protagonist, one Roger Brown, a good Norwegian name, right, a big time headhunter, you know, a person who looks for talent for big corporations, tries to ween a prospect away from some company to fill a high-end spot in one of his clients businesses. But get this old Roger had what he thought, erroneously thought when the smoke finally cleared, was a high-living trophy wife, Diana, an art gallery owner, whom he has lavished with all she wanted. All of what he thought she wanted but which put him in the hole financially. So Roger and a techie confederate were reduced to a little off-hand art thief to pay the bills. Harmless stuff really. A Munch here, a Monet there, simple stuff.

Not so simple though when one Clas, a prospect for a big client, and a former special forces kind of guy, came a calling on the frustrated Diana with whom he had an affair, an affair which Roger found out about, and which Clas had intended for him to find out about as part of a larger plot. See Clas was a techie himself, had developed transmitters for the company he was at, a company that in the age of globalization wanted to be bought up at a nice price by an American company. And so it started. Clas figured out that Roger was doing a little off-hand art thief and played his hand out that way. Told Diana that he had a Rueben left by his grandmother in her apartment. That got Rogers juices flowing.
That got Rogers interest up big time, no question, and he pulled the caper off without a hitch. But it also got him more holy hell than he could shake a stick at before the deal went down. Clas, via a transmitter put in his hair by a lover Roger had on the side, had him in his sights at all times, had his very different headhunter instincts working to kill Roger once Clas knew that Roger knew about the affair with his wife. Knew also that because of that wifely indiscretion Roger was not going to recommend him for that key job at the company he wanted to help take over that Roger had to take the big step-off.

This is where the thing went awry, where the sedate calm normalcy of Norwegian society took a big PR hit. First Rogers confederate was set up to be killed by Roger who had real versus his confederates blank bullets. Fleeing that scene Roger went to a hide-out where he tried to stash the alleged Rueben and where Clas tracked him down (and he wound up hiding in order to get away in very strange place best left unmentioned in mixed company. Clas killed the hide-out owner and left his vicious tracking dog for Roger to deal with, left him having to kill the dog. (Jesus is nothing sacred). Roger escaped but wound up in a ditch rescued by a neighbor of the hide-out owner and placed in a hospital. He tried to escape from the hospital but failed, was cornered by the cops, and was to be taken back to face murder charges for the killing of the hide-out guy and his own confederate.

On the trip back Clas, remember Clas, and remember that tracking device, rammed the police car with a truck. The cops were killed with plenty of blood showing all around, but Roger, figuring what the hell, switched clothes with one of the dead officers. He was starting to get into the idea of revenge after that episode especially after he tried to reach his ex-lover girl who was actually working with Clas. Getting back home he reconciled with Diana, figured out a fool-proof way to kill Clas, turned the play around and in a televised shoot-out killed the bugger (with an able assist by Diana) and lived happily ever after. Well that last part you knew was going to play out but damn all that blood and gore-whee! If you are going to Olso watch your back, you heard it here first.",1469232000,,4439,4.461822660098522

It was not as I expected since the main charactor was a bit humble (not like the dvd art work-wearing a nice suite)and he was not all serious guy but the movie was quite enjoyable.
The music and the camera work are other tools that make this movie more steady and made this film earn more stars.
Trough the movie there were not one moment I felt boring and the story kept me from going forward.
The main actor kind of reminded me of the hollywood actor Steve Buscemi in a good way. Maybe it was in purpose, I don't know but it was quite helpful for me to make me like him more easily.
There are other good actors that are easily made me fall in love.
When the movie first began, I was kind of skeptial that this movie is about another picture robery. But it was more then that.
There was chasing, betrayal, moments between life and death and so on.
I wouldn't give this movie a five star because of the main actor. Some would say a different thought. But for me he was not that strong charactor to sustain the entire film. If you think about  Steve Buscemi and you will have more idea. He is a good actor for sure but I felt like something is missing.

His creative response to what looks like an impossible scenario (he is terrified of dogs, and is attacked by one, is being tracked and needs to take extreme measures to remove the tracker - that's all the spoiler I will provide) reminds me of Fargo where the hapless lead character ends up with so much more than he bargained for - well worth watching and be prepared - it took us more than an hour to get unwound from this one!

Together, they weave a sexy, brutal and bloody trail all over Norway. Despite numerous shortcomings in continuity what makes the film are the superb, bloodless performances of the two leads specifically, Aksel Hennie as Roger and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Clas - both conspiring to yield a taut and spellbinding tour de force in a very intriguing and watchable film.

It is also interesting to note that the film makes no small subject (under the gallons of spilled plasma) of the more unnerving social question of  what exactly lurks behind the very thin veneer of immaculate manners and overweening social decorum when life is about to become nasty, brutish and short.",1436140800,,919,5.3310344827586205

5118042,5,B0081HLM2E,"As is the case with most movies Ive been watching lately, I heard about Headhunters a few years ago on a podcast where everyone was talking about great movies no one ever talks about. Very little was said about it, but I threw it on my queue based on the praise, and only got to watching it a little bit ago. Im glad I remembered the movie now, because this is easily among the best Ive seen this year.

Roger Brown is 56 tall, and makes up for his height with his lifestyle. He has a job that nets him tons of money, an incredible house, a beautiful and successful artist as his wife, and he steals expensive pieces of art in his spare time to keep his lavish lifestyle going. Hes even buddies with a security expert who can delete logs from security systems, and gets a nice share of what Roger gets from the art. One of the most important things when it comes to stealing, is to know everything you can about the person you're taking from. Roger targets people he interviews for his company, learning about them right there in the interview. One night at his wifes art gallery opening, Roger meets Clas Greve, a man who used to work for a very big company, and Roger immediately tries to get him tow work for his company after learning more about his background, as well as the fact that Clas has an extremely rare painting. Clas declines, but when Roger manages to get the painting, he discovers that he may have made the biggest mistake of his life- he found someone just as good as he is.

Not much of a plot summary, I know, but a lot happens in Headhunters, and I don't want to spoil any of the surprises. The movie had me worried that this was going to be some kind of business drama, but once the ball gets rolling, things get intense fast. The whole time I was watching this, I thought to myself man, this feels like something that would star Liam Neeson. Theres a lot of double-crossing, a lot of moments where someone escapes by the skin of their teeth, and a lot of tricky plotting. Headhunters has some great moments where you think you're ahead of the plot, because something is revealed early on and you think a character made an obvious mistake, but that isn't always the case here.

All of the actors do a great job, especially Aksel Hennie as Roger and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Clas. The way these characters were written is equally great too. By no means should anyone find Roger likable. Hes dastardly, steals expensive things form unsuspecting people, has no interest in even talking about having kids with his wife, and on top of that, is cheating on her. You almost have to want him to prevail in the end because the odds are stacked against him so much, yet even then he continues to keep his bad qualities. Still, I was on the edge of my seat wondering how he was going to get out of the situations he got into, considering what he was up against. This is a game of cat and mouse like no other.

I really want to say more about Headhunters because it was such a surprise. Ill stop before I ruin anything big or give away a cool twist. If you want an intense chase movie, this is what you need to watch.",1434844800,,3129,4.325383304940375

5118095,2,B0081HLM2E,"Morten Tyldum's film is a very strange piece of work.  Its premise is highly engaging: a successful headhunter Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) runs a criminal sideline together with accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander) in stealing valuable paintings.  They are generally successful at it, but meet their match when they try to steal a valuable Rubens from early-retired business person Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).  Roger becomes embroiled in a complex part where Clas is out to kill him, enlisting the help of Roger's wife Diana (Synnve Macody Lund) and girlfriend Lotte (Julie R. lgaard) in the process.

From here onwards the story becomes something of a picaresque adventure, where Roger is pursued up hill and down dale by the vindictive Clas.,  Roger shows an astonishing ability to recover from the most terrible indignities, which include having to hide himself in a a pile of excreta, with only a breathing-tube to keep him alive; being pushed off a high cliff while being strapped into a car: being attacked by a wild dog: and returning to Lotte's house only to find himself being attacked by his knife-wielding girlfriend.  The plot is full of implausibilities, mostly centering around Clas's apparent myopia, despite having the advantage of developing sophisticated tracking technology.

Eventually the story comes to a happy ending, but by then viewers have lost interest in what might be most charitably described as a preposterous thriller.  John Andreas Andersen's photography creates a gray world full of menace and pouring rain, but even this seems wasted.",1422403200,,1570,5.252

I don't even see the point of going into details. If you like a good mindbending thriller, and think Hitchcock was a true master, then you will love this film. It's 21st century Hitch. The violence is realistic but you're aware this is always a movie, so it's not overly disturbing. Not a film for kids, though.

Nothing is over done, many things are wisely understated, and I can't recall the last film I saw where it kept getting more and more interesting as it went on. The laughs are mostly black but always great fun. Even its frequent, subtle social commentaries are crisp and unobtrusive. I liked everything about Headhunters, and only wish that Hollywood would make movies this well.

5118161,5,B0081HLM2E,"Based on Jo Nesbo's book of the same name, this 2012 Norwegian film captures the essence of the book including many details. It does depart from the book in a couple of places but for good reason, and nothing that should detract from the enjoyment. One of the great things about the book is the narrative tone, and they get that as much as a movie is able.

Roger Brown is a corporate recruiter who supplements his income with the occasional art theft. That's already a good plot, but that's just the first few minutes, and the pace is non-stop. The villain is played by Nikolaj Coster-Wagner, Jamie Lanister from Game of Thrones. I thought he was a little disappointing, but believable, and everyone else is terrific too. It's also nice to see a bit of the beautiful Norwegian countryside and forest.

If you read Scandinavian thrillers, get the book too, which is wonderful. If you've already read it, fear not -- this is a terrific adaptation.",1407888000,,946,4.658682634730539

5118171,3,B0081HLM2E,"I enjoyed the first half of this film alot.  It was fast paced and there were many gripping scenes as well as many unique story lines and characters.  It was well filmed and acted.
Somewhere about the half way mark I realized that I was deflecting alot of thoughts like ""Thats impossible""  ""How did he know that?""  ""Why on earth would he do that?""
I think the final straw was when the recruiter/master-art-thief,  was stealing a $100mm painting.  Hi success was based on a strict discipline, which included being in and out of a theft within 10 minutes.
I was prepared to overlook that the planning and preparation for this historic theft a was limited to a couple of days.
But when this disciplined master thief stopped to make a phone call during the theft, rather than waiting a minute or two to make the call from the safety of his car, that was the final straw for me.  From that point on, the film sank into a morass of poor editing and scripting.
I'll probably watch this film again in the future, just to enjoy the many parts that I liked alot, not the least of which was
Synnve Macody Lund.
I only wish that the producers had insisted on another few days of script review.",1403913600,,1181,4.414746543778802

Well, kids, you aint ready for Headhunters, with all due respect.  I consider myself an old redneck, and no redneck, not male, not female, would use the descriptor ""Certain sequences in Headhunters made me gasp.""  Rednecks don't gasp.  They say ""daa-yum.""  For me, there was a few heartfelt (an adjective not very redneck, but, hey, I'm tryin to say something over here...) ""daa-yums"" in Headhunters, yes sir, yes m'am.
This is a Nordic film, subtitled, but please don't let that stop you.  And, if you have to, just sit Darnell and Bubba down for a spell, try to get it into their thick redneck skulls that not all daa-yum good movies is made in English.  Be gentle, but persistent.  And don't let Darnell drink no beer during your presentation.
To wit, Headhunters portrays a quite successful ""headhunter"" i.e. a high-up suit who recruits, who places talented men and women in corporations seeking same.  My good friend, the beautiful and dignified Michelle, got her Associates' Welding Certificate (she loves tig) and was recruited by a ""headhunter.""  She started off pulling down 50K, so maybe all them rednecks doing trade work aint so stupid after all.
The guy, the Headhunter, is also a high-line pro art thief who goes after a twenty million dollar painting owned by another suit who's being interviewed for some position, and the Headhunter uses these interviews to gather information which is of tactical value to his art-stealing sideline.  When the Headhunter interviews this one suit, the Headhunter comes to realize he's got a twenty million dollar score to take down.
And, from there, kids, we're off to the races.
Headhunters is incredible.
You'll get to meet the Headhunter's main fence confidante, a Nordic redneck (yeah, we're all over the damn place!  Sometimes, we don't even speak English too good!), a lovable dufus with an arsenal and an abiding fondness for Russian prostitues, and the Headhunter's wife, a tall, Nordic lass so beautiful ""she don't even look real,"" like Aljoseph used to say.
Enjoy.  And ask Darnell to, please, stop asking you ""what'd he just say?  What'd she just say?""

5118184,5,B0081HLM2E,"Author Jo Nesbo is often compared to Stieg Larsson, but I liked this book even better than the ""Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy.  Once I started it, I hated putting it down.  Work, errands & chores all took a back seat until I finished this.  The reader engages with the characters immediately, and the intricate plot is both imaginative and darkly compelling.  Its depiction of the intersection of the art world with corporate corruption is extremely timely in our ""1% World,"" and the longing of the characters, whether for a baby or money or world domination, is coolly yet compassionately portrayed. It's written with such a highly visual style, I immediately started ""casting"" some of my favorite actors into various roles.  Then, I was thrilled to find the film version on Amazon Prime, terrific also. I'd say Nesbo is more literary than Baldacci, less complicated than LeCarre, but I'll be reading more of his books soon. -- Diana",1400198400,,927,4.916666666666667

With its generic name and faceless cover art, I wasn't expecting much. As the opening credits rolled, I learned the movie was adapted from a book by red-hot Norwegian crime fiction author Jo Nesbo. This was the first sign that I was in for a pleasant surprise.

It was a great treat to discover this smart, stylish and exciting foreign (i.e., un-Hollywoodized) action flick with quirky characters, tense chase scenes, dirty double-crosses and a super resilient protagonist who turns out to be a lot smarter (and luckier) than you realize. There was intrigue, art, action, sex, gore and I even got choked up towards the end when the main couple finally came clean with each other. As a movie buff, it's awesome to stumble upon something you've never heard of and have it be as thoroughly enjoyable as ""Headhunters."" Bravo!",1398124800,,956,4.829268292682927

5118208,5,B0081HLM2E,"Great Movie. Suspenseful, action thriller that I find more engaging than the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, but along the same vein. Roger Brown is a great actor and his role is amazing as Roger Brown, successful headhunter with a beautiful wife suffering from a Napoleon complex and stills expensive artworks in order to keep his wife in the lap of luxury. The story picks up quickly and has everything I want in a thriller, gruesome murders, rapid action and suspense without the film being hurried or showy. Roger is about to score one big heist and have enough to stop stealing, a Rubens painting housed in the inherited house of Clas Greve, a prospective client. Clas specializes in nano-technology that can be used as homing devices applied in a gel and impossible to remove. When Roger steals the painting, he finds that he is tracked by Clas, his wife is having an affair with him and his heist partner is poisoned with a device meant for him. He runs, he hides in an outbuilding and he desperatelly tries to uncover what happened. He flips his car, shaves his head when he realizes the nano devices may be applied in it and flees to his mistresses. He discovers the mistress is in cahoots with Clas and hes on his radar for the job and not for his wife. Apparently the job will allow Clas to steal tech secrets for his company and his wife is innocent. Movie ends with a genius story to blame his ex partner on everything including killing Clas, allowing him and his wife to live happily.

I never read the book by Jo Nesbo, but a film should be able to stand alone and tell a whole story without knowing anything about the lit. that it is based on. The writers were able to succeed in doing that and doing it well. American cinema has something to learn from the dutch!",1392595200,,1784,4.47239263803681

Roger Brown ( Aksel Hennie) is a man of style and moving on up in life, beautiful house, great job as an executive recruiter and drop dead gorgeous wife Diana (Synnve Macody Lund) but the fact is that these are mere facades covering up a double life as an art thief. Rogers spendthrift ways have begun to catch up with him and he is now having trouble paying his bills. He finds about a rare painting and wants to get his hands on it because then his money troubles would be over. However he does not figure that the person he is stealing from Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), a former military commando.

5118227,4,B0081HLM2E,"Through the opening credits, Roger Brown, our hero or anti-hero depending on your view point, does a voiceover that explains the five rules of art theft. He then proceeds with a poised wit to demonstrate his manipulative gifts by bending a client to his will while extracting the information he needs to steal a valuable lithograph of Edvard Munch's The Brooch.

Roger Brown seems to have everything, a trophy wife he fears losing and a girlfriend that is only on the scene for his apparent pleasure. Roger has a fancy home with all the mod cons and likes the finer things in life, along with this his wife who is very high maintenance and hence he lives way beyond his means. His job as a leading Head hunter, for recruitment agency hardly pays the bills, however, it does enable him to pick out `marks' and then rob them of valuable art work - the main source of his income!

Roger is not particularly likable and his vicious world of international commerce is unattractive. However, a malevolent fate comes up the Kattegat in the form of Clas Greve (leading Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) to pursue the complacent, antihero.
Greve is a handsome, wealthy, charismatic son of a Dutch father and a Norwegian mother, apparently between jobs, having recently worked for a major military contractor. Roger seeks him out for Pathfinder, a conglomerate run from Oslo, and sees him as a target for theft as he secretly owns a valuable Rubens that apparently came into the family's hands by way of Nazi confiscation during the Second World War.

What follows is `tour de force' of violence and dark humor. Where would be predator becomes prey, and nothing can be taken at face value. Add some James Bond like hair gel that can be tracked by GPS and you're onto a roller coaster ride!",1387324800,,1781,4.720257234726688

I saw little if any of that in this film, which made the action and suspense all the more believable and intense. If you enjoy a well done suspense thriller don't miss this one.

This movie has some really excellent plot points and a good twist/synopsis at the end to bring it all together. Some may complain of the quick subtitles making it hard to watch the movie and not just the dialogue. Overall I didn't have a problem with this, but in certain parts it was somewhat difficult. Great movie, great action, and great intellect.

As is too typical in movies like this, the mouse got out of too many perilous situations to be believable.

5118281,3,B0081HLM2E,"This would have been an otherwise good movie for me if not for the great expectations I had developed by all the hype surrounding this movie. I was expecting a tight plot, no holes or ""why did they do that instead of this"" moments.

The plot involves the antagonist weaving an intricate web in which to manipulate and ultimately kill the protagonist, which could have been done in a number of quite simpler ways. It also involves a science fiction device that seems so out of place in a real world scenario like the one the movie takes place in. Billions are also in stake for the antagonist, who seems to be working for a larger group, and has a lot of Special Forces military connections, yet he works alone instead of having a team that would have finished the job easily.

The spectacle of this movie is all the suffering the protagonist has to endure at the hands of the antagonist. The protagonist,is acted superbly by the lead actor Aksel Hennie, there is a scene in a ravine where he is all bloody and crying and this wrenched my heart out. Part of the hype revolves around Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's performance, currently popular for his role in the `Game of Thrones' series. I didn't consider his role to have required a high level of ability, he just has to look menacing, but he is a handsome, charismatic bastard and thus you will look forward to his scenes.

This used to be at a much higher price, around $24, a price I would have regretted paying. I feel to have made the right decision to wait till the price dropped to $14.99 before making the purchase.",1372464000,,1569,4.4982456140350875

It's like a great page-turner. You can't put it down. You have to keep reading.

Same ""feeling"" here.

I was completely satisfied by the end of this film. Wish more films more like this.

Two best films I've seen over the last year,  start to finish, have been foreign films. And neither of them starred Adam Sandler. Get your s*** together, Hollywood.",1372377600,,558,4.831578947368421

I read that they made this film for the same cost as a TV movie. Incredible!! Great casting, music, editing, direction, script, and cinematography! One of the best films I've seen in the last few years. There were many twists and turns that were amazing, so I don't want to give anything away. I'll just say that there are several set pieces that are just stellar: the scenes with the dog, the outhouse scene, the car and truck scene, the male/female fight scene, etc., etc. I had high expectations going into this and this film surpassed them all!!

  ""Headhunters"" is  compelling from beginning to end.  Clever script; well acted; well done.
  Its plot may be a bit heavy on 90 degree turns, but on the other hand, the film makers pull it off.  Even when credulity
is being strained a tad.  And unlike so many other so-called ""thrillers,"" I don't think too many ""Headhunters"" viewers will prematurely see where this one is going.  Which is always a plus unless the plot twists are completely absurd.  And that's not the case here.
  Some may find a scene or two to be on the gross side -- as well as some of the violence to be over-the-top and gratuitous -- but that wasn't my reaction.  All of that fit into the context of the film -- and, as with Tarrentino efforts (or ""Killer Joe"") -- it worked for me.
  And I can't recommend ""Headhunters"" highly enough.  It's a true standout in the genre.  And well worth seeking out.",1364860800,,1052,4.408376963350785

I enjoyed the cynical story of a hero (or anti-hero) who is cultered, self-confident, and able to overcome his lack of height by marrying a gorgeous blonde who is far taller than he is. The hero is a thief who steals art to support his rich life-style. When the hero meets another thief who is also ruthless, you begin to bond with the hero in his struggle to stay free and alive and out of prison. Will the hero be able to keep his gorgeous wife? Will he be able to overcome his ruthless adversary? Or will his luck run out, and he will be taken down by the law for his past crimes?

Not a great film. But very enjoyable for its offbeat plot and characters. A solid B movie.

Some people have complained about the movie's subtitles. But if you don't understand Norwegian (the language of the film), the subtitles are obviously helpful in understanding the plot. So get over it: subtitles are usually a better alternative to having a foreign movie dubbed into English.",1361145600,,1003,4.5054945054945055
5118355,5,B0081HLM2E,"After watching Headhunters for the second time in two months, I feel compelled to review it. I know that most of you will never see it because it's subtitled, and that's a huge shame. I'm not sure how many thousands of movies I have watched over the years, but this may be the most original script I have ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I can assure you.

Although I know I must review the movie, I also don't want to tell you anything about it at all. It's too surprising to be ruined by a review that gives away any of its many revelations.

So what can I tell you?

Roger Brown is 5'6"" tall and has a wife who is beautiful, successful, and several inches taller than him. She's about to open her own art gallery. He's insecure and almost sure that she'll eventually leave him, so he tries to compensate by giving her expensive gifts and living in a house that is out of his price range. He works as a headhunter, placing people in high-powered jobs, but he supplements his income by stealing paintings.

We are shown how Brown carefully uses his main job to select potential targets for his criminal activities. His accomplice, Ove (Sander) works in security, and helps Brown disable alarms. Brown dreams of the day that he steals something valuable enough to enable him to change his life forever, and an opportunity presents itself when Clas Greve (Coster-Waldau) tells Brown's wife that he owns a Rubens.

I don't want to reveal any more plot points.

Aksel Hennie looks like a more refined version of Steve Buscemi, and has the same sort of charm. Even though he's a criminal, it's hard not to root for him. Some of the situations that he finds himself in are bizarre, but his actions seem logical and intelligent under the circumstances.

The movie is based on Jo Nesb's novel. I sometimes watch successful movies, such as Avatar, and sit there wondering how such a predictable plot ever ended up being made into a movie. I'm certain that I could do better. But if I had written Headhunters, I would be extremely proud. You won't be able to predict many of the twists and turns taken by this plot. It's nothing short of genius.

I saw some great films in 2012, but even though there was a Tarantino release, and several others worth 4.5 or 5/5, I don't think anything surpassed Headhunters in terms of sheer enjoyment. If you are open to subtitled films, this is a must. If you aren't, maybe this can be your first. An American remake appears to be scheduled for next year. Your other choice is to learn Norwegian. It would almost be worth the effort.",1361059200,,2564,4.510775862068965

5118357,5,B0081HLM2E,"wow, this had been sitting in my watchlist for months.  Probably due to subtitles.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Great film...  bet we will be seeing an english remak in the near future",1360800000,,185,4.6875
5118358,4,B0081HLM2E,"First off, I'm surprised at the number of user reviews for a foreign movie with only a little more than one million in U.S. ticket sales. That being said, I'm glad to see it because this deserves a wide audience.

Here's the scoop. Roger Brown is a high-level head hunter who uses his position to gain enough info from prospective candidates to rob them of valuable artwork and support his lavish lifestyle and gorgeous wife. He slips up by targeting a candidate who has worked with a high tech company in possession of nano-tracking technology. Said candidate has also worked as an operative in various hot spots around the world. Roger simply chose the wrong target and is literally in deep doo-doo.

This is one clever flick. The plot is just complicated enough to keep the viewer in the game. It unfolds at a very even pace. There was no time in the film that I felt things were lagging. There are also some nifty ways the plot turns as well as some very shocking, disgusting, surreal occurrences that caught me totally off guard. At a certain point this becomes a cat and mouse game which is something I enjoy in a flick. These two guys are surprisingly well matched though it might not seem so at first glance. Seeing the 'back and forth' play out is very satisfying. As in a Hitchcock thriller, the protagonist gets in so deep you cannot imagine he'll dig his way out. You just hang in and hope.

All the production values, directing, music, etc. are of high order. I liked the actors and the color palette. This is just a nifty flick from top to bottom. About the only weak spot was at the end where they had to visually and through narrative lead the viewer to how all this was going to play out. This was a common technique in mystery thrillers of the 40s but has pretty much disappeared since. Other than that, plant your jaws into this. You won't be disappointed.",1360800000,,1875,4.492668621700879

There are a couple of gory parts in the movie: I actually had to make fun of one scene because it bothered me so much and yet was utterly absurd (the tractor was involved). Those gory parts were (mostly) crucial to the plot/ending. I hate subtitled movies, but this one captured my interest from the beginning (it's from Norway). P.S.

5118368,5,B0081HLM2E,"Scandinavian films have made their mark on the action film genre with Stieg Larsson's ""Millenium"" novels adapted to screen with wide commercial and critical success. Jo Nesbo's ""Head Hunters"", a thriller from Norway, filmed in Oslo and the outskirts, in a similar vein, offers plenty of action with that touch of the macabre that is getting to be staple Scandinavian fare.

Synnve Macody Lund and Aksel Hennie, the two leads in the film, play Diana and Roger Brown, a couple living the high life in Norway. Roger is a headhunter with a supplementary vocation, kept secret from his wife, to help keep up their lifestyle. He is in the business of selling paintings that bring him massive returns. The price of these paintings are quite literally a steal for him and one particular business deal promises the lifestyle he has always been seeking for his wife. Oblivious of Roger's underground vocation, Diana seems to like their life. But there is a noticeable emptiness in her life. She tells her husband about her deeper interest in getting a family started. She often tries to get Roger to pay less attention to work, and more attention to their home, their future together as a couple.

Roger's voice overs reveal a man tragically caught up in the illusion of devoting himself entirely to the business of making a living, even if it comes at the cost of alienating his wife. He assumes that Diana's interest in their marriage is reduced to her regard for the high life he has created for them. These introspective voice overs, reveals Roger's fears more clearly. The perception that his beautiful wife will move on in her life with someone else eventually rules his life. We now suspect that his get rich schemes behind her back may only be a reflection of his insecurities. He fails to see the obvious: Diana's needs and interests lie closer to home.

Synnve Macody Lund as Diana Brown is a remarkable debut performance. She has a screen presence that is reminiscent of Grace Kelly at her finest (I am thinking of her performance in ""Rear Window"" as the glamour woman who is also uncompromisingly devoted to her partner). She has that rare combination of stunning beauty and earnestness that matches the grace of the Hollywood legend. Hennie plays the smug, sophisticated Roger Brown, rapidly spiraling out of control as his seemingly fool proof scheme and living beyond his means, unravels when he meets his match in Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).

The writing and direction are consistently impressive. The film is finely crafted and has the style, snap, and grit of a vintage Don Siegel 1970s action film. Siegel's ""Coogan's Buff"" and ""Dirty Harry"" are its ancestors. The crisp rapid pace of ""Head Hunters"" is one noticeable virtue of the film. The film's polished self-conscious style also packs quite a punch with its  unsettling, gritty realism. There are genuine shocks to be found here for even the most seasoned action film audiences.

Hennie is making quite a reputation for himself as an actor in Scandinavia and the wider international film scene, and rightly so. His role here as Roger Brown, husband, businessman, and swindler, conjures up the image of Hollywood actor, James Spader, who briefly came to prominence in the late eighties and early nineties.

This thriller from Oslo is another representative of the grand cultural turn in the history of Scandinavian film.  This is a gem of recent international cinema you will not want to miss.",1359072000,,3464,4.919520547945205
5118369,4,B0081HLM2E,"Hodejegerne (Headhunters) (Morten Tyldum, 2011)

Fun little thriller, based on the Jo Nesbo novel of the same name, about a corporate headhunter, Roger Brown (Cold Lunch's Aksel Hennie), who dabbles in grand theft in order to finance his wife's lavish lifestyle. At an art opening, he meets the almost-too-good-to-be-true Clas Greve (Mama's Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), not only a perfect fit for a job he's got open, but the owner of an original Rubens that seems to be just sitting around collecting dust. The problem is, Clas Greve is also ex-Special Forces, and he doesn't like people taking his stuff...and if I tell you how the cat-and-mouse game between these two guys even begins, we'll be getting into spoiler territory. Let's just say that the heist goes horribly, hilariously (if you have as warped a sense of humor as I do) wrong, and things only get worse from there. You won't believe how much worse.

It's a fine, fine little movie, tight and funny and very well-acted by the principals. It doesn't do any envelope-pushing, but who cares? Sometimes all you need is a good, well-paced thriller. After all, look at how much money the Bourne movies made, and Headhunters is better than any of them. Unfortunately, Hollywood, smelling blood in the water, is planning a remake for 2014 (as I write this, Mark Wahlberg is rumored to star). I guess people just don't want to read subtitles, huh? *** ",1358812800,,1403,4.88655462184874
5118370,5,B0081HLM2E,"Roger Brown, 5""6"" and overcompensating for it by his own admission, is a successful corporate headhunter. Not successful enough to afford the lifestyle he and his gorgeous amazon wife live, however. So Roger and Ove, who works for a security company, have a racket. Ove turns off a house's security system, and Roger burgles the house of its expensive artwork. The key is that they replace the painting with a copy, so the trail is cold by the time the theft is discovered.

Roger is not likable. He cheats on his wife. The chip on his shoulder is enormous. He's successful as a headhunter because he is good at manipulation. But by about the middle of the film, I started feeling really sorry for him. Roger is a jerk, but he is a non-violent jerk. And after meeting Clas Greve at the opening of Diana's new art gallery, his world doesn't just start falling apart, it starts falling violently apart. Clas is one mean man to cross.

Through it all, Roger keeps his head. He is quick on his feet and I admire intelligence on the spot. And, after a while, I started rooting for him because, golly, how many times does a man have to be shot at before you simply have to be on his side?

The plotting of ""Headhunters"" is great. Twists and turns and positively Kafkaesque at times. But there's humor, too, though it is mostly black humor. But anyone can relate to using a toilet paper tube to breathe as you submerge yourself in an outhouse pit. At the end, it all comes together in a great AHA climax.

""Headhunters"" is definitely not a movie for the squeamish or for kids. There's a lot of blood and a lot of gore, with sex thrown in for good measure.  But if you don't mind the violence, watch it for the keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Clas Greve, may be better known for his part as Jaimie Lassiter, in the HBO series, ""Game of Thrones"". In ""Headhunters"", he's easy on the eyes even while his special forces flintiness makes you worry for poor Roger.

""Headhunters"" was filmed in Norway, and we watched it with English subtitles. Summit Entertainment, an American company, has bought the rights to remake the movie in English. Totally unnecessary. Watch the original!

DVD Special Features:
1. ""Behind the Scenes of Headhunters"" (20 minutes) This is also in Norwegian with English subtitles. It was enjoyable, and has comments by the actors playing major characters, as well as the director, cinematographer, producer and screenwriter. Producer Asle Vatn talks about how scheduling was difficult, because they knew they wanted Coster-Waldau, but ""We are shooting at the same time as 'Game of Thrones'. He's in Ireland and we're in Norway.""
Claus Greve's murderous dog is played by a 140 pound pitbull. He's actually a Russian police dog, and they had to get special permission to import him for the part, because he's illegal in Europe. He also turned out to be a bit of a coward!

5118372,4,B0081HLM2E,"Very well-written and acted. I really enjoyed this film. While the protagonist did not have the physical characteristics that are commonly associated with a leading man (a fact the character contends early in the film), he has great stage presence and a range that runs the gamut of human emotions. He's an antihero at best but you become totally enthralled with his plight and share in in his bewilderment as we navigate sharp curves and hidden agendas throughout the course of the film. Overall, not a bad way to spend two hours.",1358035200,,531,4.782608695652174

Based on these numbers I gave this movie a go. At first I wasn't happy with the movie but once the crazy ""conspiracy"" started, I was hooked! Excellent movie, easily 5/5 stars and I'm extremely glad I watched it. The ending was GREAT too!

I hope the hollywood re-make does happen.  5/5 stars and will recommend to my friends!",1358035200,,390,4.791044776119403
5118374,3,B0081HLM2E,"Overall this is an enjoyable little film. It suffers from not making it clear that the central character of the burglar is quick thinking and imaginative. The chase scenes are fairly exciting but at some point it becomes unbelievable. It is heartless assassin stuff.

Where the King of this genre is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-of-the-Jackal/dp/B008RKLRZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day of the Jackal</a>&nbsp;as well as the connection with real life events in France at that time, that film is also beautifully paced. Plenty of room for the viewer to get to know the assassin. Can we really condemn this professional man for his killings? He only kills when he is threatened, after all. The rich woman in bed is a masterpiece of dueling sympathies. A film I watch many times.

The Headhunters is nowhere near this level. The film propels itself from one chase scene to another. They are often ingenious action sequences but ultimately the film is perilously close to comic book with some unbelievable twists. A one shot film.",1357948800,,1085,5.530120481927711

The movie, however, doesn't stay true to the original story - they changed how Roger Brown found out 'his bit on the side' is actually working for Greve. Anyway, a movie from a book is not usually good (take the Hunger Games for one!).

5118381,5,B0081HLM2E,"This Norwegian film is such great fun. We open with a man who is a headhunter by day and an art thief the rest of the time.  He uses both to maintain an absolutely lavish lifestyle. He then steals a painting from one of his headhunting clients who was a tracker and killer for the military,  This is where the fun begins, a cat and mouse game where there is one audacious attempt to kill after another.  The pace is electric on this and the adventure is first rate. There are multiple twists and turns. This film shows that action adventure films can be done with creativity and intelligence.

note: my husband also viewed this on netflix instant. he liked it but was complaining about its being so violent.  i seem to have a higher tolerance for graphic violence than he does. so if violence really bothers you, you may not like it as much as i did.

5118383,5,B0081HLM2E,"I have always had a big interest in Scandinavian films. I don't often come across them in my neck of the woods, but almost always I end up loving their films. Once I saw the trailer for the Norwegian film Headhunters, based on the novel by the increasingly popular author Jo Nesb, I just had a feeling I would love it.

The film is introduced by its main character, Roger Brown (Askel Hennie), who gives us the insight into his life. One the outside, the relatively short man has a glamorous life complete with a fancy house, nice car, expensive suits, and a gorgeous wife (a breakout performance by newbie Synnve Macody Lund). As they usually are, things are different behind the scenes for Roger. Aside from some issues with his marriage, Roger happens to also have the secret of being an art thief when he's not doing his day job as a corporate headhunter.

Roger's wife, Diana, happens to own an art gallery. As fate would have it, an acquaintance of Diana's, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) tells her about a very rare painting he is in the possession of. Upon hearing of this, Roger decides this is his next mark. Roger, along with his accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander) coordinate the heist. The situation turns out to be more than what Roger bargained for when its discovered Clas is a former mercenary and a big wig of a tech company that makes GPS tracking devices.

The film's sly sense of humor and charismatic lead immediately drew me into the picture, but I have to say once the action of the plot kicked in, I couldn't turn away. I honestly didn't expect the action the film had, and the several twists and turns it took. The movie just doesn't let up, but it's far more than just being about the action. The storyline is clever and exciting and the film does a great job of building on the characters and making us feel something for them.

Headhunters is yet another example of how the Scandinavians are doing something so right that Hollywood can't seem to grasp. The movie was an exciting thriller while also having a well thought out plot and well written characters. What I really appreciated was the amount of dark humor the film had, which wasn't arbitrarily added in, it naturally added some comic relief without being turning the film into a farce. There's also the drama between the characters, especially Roger and Diana, that felt genuine and again built on our feelings towards the characters.

This film is likely my favorite of the year. It had it all: crime, action, plot twists, and the pacing was perfect. The film looks great and has a cool style to it, but it manages to pull of being a stylish flick without showboating or coming off as being full of itself. Headhunters is certainly a serious film, but it's intelligent way of combining the many aforementioned traits keep it quite entertaining.

5118384,3,B0081HLM2E,"If you're planning to watch this to catch Nikolaj Coster-Waldau outside the Game of Thrones, he has a relatively small part here. The lead guy (Aksel something) is okay of course, but he isn't the best actor in the cast, which is distracting.  The plot, altho dirivative and over-the-top at times, would probably be fun for younger male audiences and random others.  It's not a bad movie. I gave it 3 stars, but if there had been a scale of 1 to 10, it would have gotten 6.  If it's Waldau you're after, see the series, New Amsterdam, on hulu.

5118387,3,B0081HLM2E,"`Headhunters' is a fun ride.  It has thrills and some excellent technical work and the story is compelling enough to keep your interest throughout.  It tells the story of a young man who makes a living stealing valuable art pieces and selling them off.  He isn't the most attractive young man and yet he manages, through his wallet, to secure for himself a KNOCKOUT girlfriend and a KNOCKOUT mistress.  Apparently, it isn't all in his wallet (that aspect being in his head) since they both seem to genuinely have feelings for him.  He winds up getting in way too far over his head when he attempts to steal from a new suave prospect putting the moves on his girlfriend.  Next thing you know he's running for his life as he becomes the hunted in a wicked game of cat and mouse.

The film is adapted from Swedish author Jo Nesbo's novel.  I'm currently in the middle of reading Nesbo's `The Snowman', so I can say that the film certainly carries his stamp of delivery.  I can see his writing in the film despite the fact that I haven't read the source material.

`Headhunters' is fluid.

My issue with the movie is that it lacks any real bite.  I won't say that it isn't thrilling, because it does have those elements, but at the end of the day it is truly forgettable.  Fun, for forgettable.  Unlike other Swedish bred murder films (namely `The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo') `Headhunters' can't rise up to make us remember it when it's over.  It lacks the haunting quality that is needed to make it a better film.  Instead, it is just a little too familiar, pulling from other films (at times obviously) and it struggles with finding a tone (it really wants to insert humor in places it doesn't fit) and some of the plot developments are just obvious and sorely underplayed.

Bah, it could have been great, but it will have to settle with good.  It is good, I won't begrudge it that.  I just wish it was better.",1356048000,3,1910,4.468208092485549

5118395,4,B0081HLM2E,"The Headhunters tells the story of 5 foot 6 inches tall Roger Brown, who is a headhunter (recruiter for top-level managers). Roger has a beautiful wife, and because of his fear of losing her he showers her with lavish gifts and an expensive home - things that are beyond his means. To support this lifestyle, he steals valuable paintings on the side - from his clients. However, when Roger steals a very expensive painting from an enigmatic client, things take an unexpected - and scary - turn and his life turns upside down.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Headhunters - I thought the acting was superb and that the script was clever. Sure, there are some hardly believable scenes, but overall it was quite believable. The movie starts slow but picks up pace quickly and then never slows down. There are quite a few twists and turns - some of them easily anticipated, others quite surprising. I especially liked Aksel Hennie in the leading role but the other actors/actresses did a good job as well.

There are a few grisly scenes in this movie, so be aware of that. The movie itself is not meant to be a bloodbath or anything, but a few scenes were pretty gruesome. The version I thought was subtitled, and I know some people don't like that. I didn't have any difficulty following the movie though. Overall, I would rate this pretty highly - I think it goes to show that you can make a solid movie without a bunch of big explosions and fires and other bells and whistles that Hollywood relies so much on these days. I think it all ends in the story, and I thought the story here was well-crafted. If you enjoy fast-paced edge of your seat thrillers, I think you'll like this one. If you are looking for a movie with a lot of fight scenes and/or lots of explosions, this isn't your movie.",1354924800,,1784,4.503086419753086

5118397,5,B0081HLM2E,"I read Jo Nesbo's Headhunters a few months ago and found it to be a fast-paced thriller that combined the world of multi-million dollar (in this case, kroner) executive talent scouts, art thievery, murder, corporate intrigue, and, above all, deceit.  While the story could have easily reached 700+ pages, Nesbo forces his story into only 304 pages.  After reading Headhunters, I learned that the film adaptation of the book was set to be released.  I couldn't wait to see it.
I was hesitant at first to watch a film that is almost entirely Norwegian in dialogue (there are a few lines of English) with subtitles because I felt that the constant reading of the lines would take my focus away from the visual medium and cause me to miss some of the action.  Prior to watching this film, I watched the Millenium trilogy in Swedish and these worries about the language barrier were put to rest.
Overall, the film stays very true to the book.  As with all films, creative changes were made, but I was very pleased to see my favorite moments from the book played out on the screen.

5118401,4,B0081HLM2E,"This Norwegian import was quite the pleasant surprise.  Combining the disturbing wit of the Coen Brothers, the mystery of Hitchcock and the in-your-face visceral gore of Sam Raimi, Morten Tyldum's film has enough twists and turns for any fan of the genre.

Roger Brown (excellent Aksel Hennie) narrates his own story.  Although he is a successful corporate recruiter (headhunter), he has trouble making ends meet.  He's living over his head always trying to make an impression on his statuesque trophy-wife Diane (beautiful Synnove Macody Lund).  He lets the audience know that he's only 5' 6"" more than once.  He supports Diana's art gallery opening and is constantly paranoid about his wife's commitment.  To us it appears her only concern is that Roger refuses to discuss the idea of having children.

Needing more income, Roger has a sideline.  He steals rare art (Diana unwittingly gives him information), replacing it with near perfect reproductions.  It turns out that one of Roger's potential clients, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is known to have a valuable Renoir.  As Roger lifts the painting, he discovers his wife's phone in Clas's apartment.  Hmm.  This set up leads to a strong middle section of the film where Clas is hunting down Roger in an effort to kill him.

This frankly doesn't make much sense, but it's a lot of fun to try to figure out why.  At the same time we see poor Roger go through a series of identity changes and escape mechanisms including one you won't forget any time soon.  This is a skillfully made, tension filled drama with just enough wickedness to make it a cut above.

The Blu ray version of this film looks excellent.  Although I suspect it was shot on film, the 1080p transfer looks very digital-like.  That is, there is little if any grain.  As it takes place in cold Norway, the whites are bright and the sky is blue, very blue.  Excellent blacks as well.  You have 2 audio options, both DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I only watched the Norwegian version with English subtitles.  The other option is a dubbed English language version.  The audio is very active with the soundtrack very noticable throughout the film.",1353888000,,2165,4.8497267759562845

""Headhunters"" (""Hodejegerne"") is a thriller about Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), a headhunter by day and art thief by night. With a help from is accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander), Roger continues to steal so that he can maintain his lavish lifestyle. Living in a fancy house with his beautiful wife Diana (Synnve Macody Lund), Roger Brown thinks his life is going well until he breaks into a certain person's apartment where Roger discovers something that strongly suggests his life was not perfect after all.

The situation goes from bad to worse when Roger realizes he is being hunted down by someone - someone holding a gun with a malicious intent. As the body count increases, Roger, now a desperate fugitive, must find a way to survive and fight back, no matter what it takes, in his case, like hiding in a very stinky place.

Directed by Morten Tyldum with skills and confidence, the Norwegian/German film is not so much about deadly cat-and-mouse chase as our protagonist's internal changes through hardships including bloody violence. The film's strength lies in the twisty plotline that is not only unpredictable but suspenseful and even darkly funny at times. This is a thrilling 100 minute ride with a character-driven story.",1353456000,,1270,5.0669856459330145

It is a dark love-story, but it contains excellent dramatic elements that keep one on the edge of one's seat. Yes, it has English subtitles, but I find that after a few minutes I don't even realize they are speaking Norwegian. The brain compensates.

5118410,5,B0081HLM2E,"Headhunters is a Norwegian thriller that follows headhunter Roger Brown as he attempts to steal an extremely valuable painting from ex-mercenary Clas; Clas then uses his mercenary skills to hunt Roger in an epic game of cat-and-mouse. Of course, the story is a lot deeper than that, but I'd rather not spoil this excellent film.

The story packs in plenty of thrills and twists to keep the audience at the edge of their seats and gasping in awe; the film also uses immersive dialogue to keep the audience fully engaged. There are many thrilling scenes in this film; my favorite is the sequence in the cabin where Roger must hide in an outhouse, which is packed with thrills and disgusts. (You can probably guess, but I won't spoil the reason.) The ending of the film was great and twisted. There is a lot of violence in the film and some vicious gore effects. It's beautifully shot, as well. The acting was also amazing; I haven't seen many Norwegian films so I didn't recognize most of the actors, but I plan on watching more after this phenomenal film. I also enjoyed the music.

Overall, Headhunters is a brilliant crime thriller. It's thoroughly entertaining and captivating; I couldn't look away and refused to take any breaks. As of 11/10/12, this film is available on Netflix Steaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, but a purchase is also highly recommended.

This film has strong violence and gore. There are also multiple scenes of full male and female nudity, and a few sex scenes.",1352505600,,1492,4.7528957528957525

And very clever.

5118413,5,B0081HLM2E,Headhunters is Norwegian and has subtitles but don't let this deter you.  The tight logical plot is easy to follow and provides some thrilling action.  It is one of the best of its genre I've ever seen.,1351036800,,202,4.4324324324324325

5118415,3,B0081HLM2E,"I only wanted to see this film because of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Most of the film was focused on Roger Brown, played by Aksel Hennie. It's a testament to his performance and the action sequences in the film that I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This film is also genre busting in a way because the focus of the film is more on relationships than the sex and violence. Roger Brown has a really wonderful character arc. I felt one way about him at the beginning of the film and by the end I really wow... did a total 180 just because he grows so much through his experience. The plot keeps you guessing.

5118423,5,B0081HLM2E,"Folks,
  Hollywood remakes foreign movies for our convenience of eliminating the subtitle hassle, and out of arrogance. Eh, don't let them touch this one.  THEY WILL RUIN IT TO ALL GLORY!!! It is just fine. I did the hard work of: stop, rewind, play, pause, etc. And, it was worth it!! I literally found myself trying to talk to the main character (the seedy guy making his buck) to hold it together and not get killed! This movie was smart, unpredictable at times, and just simplistically beautiful. I had lucked out through my search with this one. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS FILM!!! NO USUAL MOVIE CLICHES in this one!!! You will not do the 'yeah, yeah, yeah...'

  Hollywood is slipping... There are foreign films out there like this one that are so much more memorable.

  Americans, get off the straight a way highway were you zone out. Be a little more active, exert a little more  mental energy, and WATCH MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE!!! It will be worth your night!!!",1349308800,52,967,4.635294117647059

Headhunters is a fine film which I enjoyed more than I expected. A fine cast and decent script led me to watch this and the time flew by. I have not yet read the book but hope to do so soon.
If the Norwegians can make Jo Nesbo's novels as good as this on film, hopefully they can repeat this perfection with Nesbo's Harry Hole novels.
If it's a decent caper you're after or something other than the usual US offerings, then Headhunters is a very decent alternative.",1349308800,,676,4.459677419354839
5118426,4,B0081HLM2E,"Well crafted, creative and intelligent movies tend to more often than not come out of those northern Scandinavian cold, dark climes. Must be those winters.

Plot: Story revolves around a professional corporate talent recruiter who also sidelights as an art thief meant to gain extra income that his insecurities and self doubts require, he believes, to support a trophy wife. Things, as you can imagine, don't always go as planned and add to that the additional twisty complication of, ""Just who is doing the hunting?""

Criticism: For English audiences that have to follow subtitling and scenic nuances at the same time; some of the subtleties and twists may be missed or difficult to follow. I had to go back a second time and view the critical near last scene to resolve some inconsistencies. Also, probably due to editing, and a bit to scripting, the character development and general flow of the movie seemed uneven, rough or rocky at times. The ending, in particular, seemed rushed and some loose ends still seem loose.",1348876800,2,1024,4.9476744186046515

I am not going to get into what this movie is about because other reviewers have already covered the basics of this film.

5118440,5,B0081HLM2E,"When you find a good foreign language movie, you end up watching it and not really realising that you are listening to a foreign language while reading subtitles.  In this movie it was so entertaining that this happened.  The story was so interesting, fun and full of action that the annoyance of the subtitles could be ignored.

The casting of Aksel Hennie (an actor I have never heard of or seen before) in the lead role was physically and mentally perfect for the part.  He made me feel sorry for him even when he was being an arrogant twit, which was the point.  While Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was also perfect for his role giving even more fuel to Hennie's characters insecurities, although I did keep seeing him as his role of Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones - a slight case of being typecast but I believe that was more in my mind than anything else.

Some gory parts that did make me close to retching but these were very few and were necessary to the story, nothing gratuitous.  Some really funny parts that made me laugh out loud - see the cops Tweedledee and Tweedledum for reference.

A prime example of where European movie makers do it so much better than American movie makers for making a movie realistic.  When the lead character was struggling to move the dead weight of a dead body I just knew that in the American version (if there was one) he would have been able to lift it without breaking sweat.  This along with various other realistic moments made it a really good movie.

5 out of 5 from me and worth a watch even if you are not normally a fan of foreign language movies.",1346630400,4,1598,4.438356164383562

5118442,4,B0081HLM2E,"""Headhunters"" (Hodejegeme) is a Norwegian thriller with dark comic overtones, based  on the novel by Jo Nesl. Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a shrewd corporate headhunter. He gets the right person for his company and makes the prospect's reputation with an aggressive attitude and unconventional advice. He's also short and financially overextended. Roger moonlights as an art thief to support a lavish lifestyle and, especially, to impress his beautiful, statuesque wife Diana (Synnve Macody Lund), whom he always fears will leave him for someone taller and richer. Desperate for cash, bank account overdrawn, Roger needs to score big. He finds his target in a conspicuously charming Dutchman, Clas Greve (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau), who is harboring a Reubens painting in his Oslo apartment. But Greve, a Special Ops veteran and ruthless CEO, will prove to be a more formidable, and more violent, opponent than Roger bargained for.

This plot goes over the top for black comedic effect, occasionally bordering on farce. Good writing and Morten Tyldum's deft direction combine with Aksel Hennie's terror and fighting spirit to pull this off. This could just be silly in other hands. But it's funny and suspenseful, with a selfish, insecure, sympathetic protagonist and a handsome, obsessed, almost cartoonish villain. Nicolaj Coster-Waldau is having fun being evil. ""Headhunters"" strengths are bizarre twists, one after another, that seem plausible enough but which no one, neither Roger nor the audience, could have predicted and the surprising mettle with which Roger meets these grim challenges. He seems surprised by his own determination and fortitude. The audience certainly is. But Roger keeps going and concocts a few surprises himself. Incidentally, Synnve Macody Lund, so alluring and natural onscreen, is not a professional actress. She's a Norwegian film critic.

The DVD (Magnolia 2012): The film is primarily in Norwegian with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and ""Behind the Scenes of Headhunters"" (22 min), which offers optional English subtitles. This featurette interviews director Morten Tyldum, cinematographer John Andreas Andersen, the film's producers, Aksel Hennie, and Synnve Macody Lund about the conception of the project, the challenge of working on a budget of only about $5.2 million, the characters of Roger and Clas, casting, the actors, filming the car crash, and more.",1346284800,2,2467,5.503957783641161

This is one of the best suspense heist movies weve seen and weve seen a lot. Without giving anything away its a whos doing what to whom and who do you trust with some decent action sequences. It is about a headhunter who has a side job to live well beyond his means and the trouble it causes also makes it a good physiological drama. This was a second watch for us so renting it was the only disappointment because we forgot all about it. watching it again was a real pleasure and the outhouse scene will long linger in the back of my mind.,1524960000,,771,4.361111111111111
