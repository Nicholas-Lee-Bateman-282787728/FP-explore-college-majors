8590521,5,B00D80GIXM,This is a cute little movie that remains almost entirely consistent with Stravinsky's score.  I will be conducting a performance of this piece and wanted to see this to gain ideas.  I enjoyed this movie.  The Princess' dance was most beautiful.  This piece is a tour de force for all the instrumentalists and I wish they had gotten more credit.,1418860800,6,344,4.683333333333334
8590522,5,B00D80GIXM,"An allegory interpreted mostly in mime, with a poetic narration and a wonderful solo by Berliosova in the role of the Princess.  Robert Helpmann is very dynamic in the role(s) of the Devil.  The settings (indoor and outdoor) are selected for their symbolic qualities and give the action a timeless, other-worldly feeling.  Camera work is a bit static.  Not a lot of dancing but an interesting interpretation of Stravinsky's music.",1382918400,7,430,5.1
