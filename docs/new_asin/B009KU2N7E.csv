The director really manages to capture the spirit of this generation and the new ground they were breaking.  The cast is INCREDIBLE and while I've never been a huge fan of Kristen Stewart's in the past, her performance here is first rate.  Don't miss it.",1369094400,3,326,4.491525423728813
5345165,4,B009KU2N7E,"On The Road is a classic piece of American literature and for many years it's been a complete nightmare to turn into a movie. Francis Ford Coppolla has owned the rights to the book since 1979 and after several failed attempts Coppolla has finally produced an On The Road movie.
Reviews are mixed on this one and YES there is a ton of detail missing from the film that was in the book, but unless you want a 10 hour ""On The Road"" miniseries, this will do for now. The actors are all excellent, the period settings are fantastic and the story flows like whiskey into a glass. I hoped to like On The Road but I wound up REALLY liking it. It's taking forever for this movie to come to Blu ray in the US (it's been available in the UK for months now) but I think I'll be picking it up to own. If anything, On The Road (the movie) is interesting enough to get a whole new generation to pick up the book. Lots of drugs, sex, jazz, eccentric characters, beautiful cinematography and poetry make this film worth a look.
Overall I appreciated and enjoyed On The Road for what it is, not what it isn't.",1368316800,5,1091,4.22488038277512
5345166,5,B009KU2N7E,"I believe the two people that gave this movie 2 stars (J. Lindy and Jay B. Lane) know nothing about serious movie making, nor how so very difficult it is to adapt any book, let alone ""On the Road,"" for the big screen. Considering the popularity and fame, or infamy, of this literary work, why would Hollywood (read BS-wood) take so long to bring it to the screen?

I'll tell you why! Because American screenwriters and directors don't have the sensitivity that it takes to write or direct movies that require the level of solidarity and caring that is necessary to recreate real human pain, suffering, uncertainty, and decadence.  You really need Latin-Americans for that! People who know what those things feel like, because they've seen it first hand.

That's why they gave the task to Walter Salles and Jos Rivera.  In my opinion, they did an excellent job of reproducing the aura of Kerouac's book.  Everything in the movie, from the ""beat"" of the music to the ""beat"" of the typewriter, contributes to the feeling that you get when you read the book.  BEAT!  Get it?  ""The Beat Generation!""

When Americans try to create AURA movies, all we get is 2 to 2.5 hours of a star studded cast talking about why they didn't make enough money, or why they did or didn't go to bed with one another, or what they are going to do about the relative, friend, or whoever, who is in rehab.  Always good for a couple of hours of boredom, and an ultimate feeling of emptiness!

The worst part of it all is that when they do turn to Latin-Americans who actually can and do a great job of picking the best parts of such a difficult work of art as ""On the Road,"" being just artsy enough not to bore anyone, and successfully making the audience basically feel the same as if they had read the book, you get xenophobics (like J. Lindy and Jay B. Lane) who immediately disregard the effort, simply because the people ""in charge"" are not American enough (though they are, only Latin-) to properly render such an iconic American story to such an iconic American pastime that is the ""silver screen.""  Shame on you!",1367798400,,2092,4.534574468085107
5345167,2,B009KU2N7E,"I anxiously awaited this film version of Kerouac's magnificent book and was so bummed out by the final product. I realize that translating book to film is a daunting task, but I think it's reasonable for a film adaptation to leave audience members feeling as moved by the film as by the book. I give props to the actors, who genuinely seemed to be trying to inhabit their characters and gave brave performances. The script, however, just didn't do the film justice, and I think that's what really dragged this film so far down and made it such a disappointment. When did Sal's aunt become his mom? When did Bull become such a minor (and virtually disposable) character? When did the trip to Mexico become reduced to a glossed-over pit stop? The real ""On The Road"" is a journey narrative both literally and metaphorically. This film basically reduces it to an adolescent joy ride that never really illustrates the metaphoric implications or symbolism, or the characters' internal personal journeys that evolve through the relationships and the collective journey they share (for the most part). Kerouac's book would have been better served by a 15- or 20-minute YouTube version titled ""dumbed-down semi-authentic version of 'On The Road,' "" The film visits some of the major vignettes of the memoir  in record speed with generous tweaks and abbreviations. Unlike the book, it never really shows with any great profundity in how the characters grow, how they're much different at the end of the journey than they were at the beginning. If you really want to know the authentic richness of the story Kerouac wrote, do yourself a favor: read the book. The film is a MacDonalds version, a red-slime hamburger version of a beautifully aged and surgically cut Porterhouse, a distorted version of a genuine masterpiece.",1365206400,6,1811,4.957236842105263
5345168,4,B009KU2N7E,"""On the Road"" (2012 release; 140 min.) is the movie adoptation of the 1957 ""beatnik"" novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac. In the movie we follow two main characters: Dean (played by Garrett Hedlund) and Kerouac stand-in Sal (played by Sam Riley), as they travel around the country and meet a multitude of characters. There really is no ""plot"" as such and henre there is no risk of ruining your viewing experience by revealing the (non)plot.

Several comments: first, the movie is intended to convey the world of the beatniks (think also William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg), and as we see this unfold, you come to the realization that theirs is a world that is very narrow, contrary to what one might've expected. If it doesn't involve smoking (cigarettes or weed), drinking (alcohol or coffee), sex, and/or jazz music (and preferably all of those at once), then it's probably not worth experiencing. Of course there is also the writing of young Jack/Sal but the movie does not convey at all what really moves the writer or what his writing process really is. Second, as to the multitude of characters Dean and Sal meet, there is a fairly large ensemble cast and part of the fun of the movie is to figure out who is playing what role. An almost unrecognizable Viggo Mortensen plays a small role of someone named Old Bull Lee. Amy Adams plays a wild looking Jane (the wife of one of their friends). Kirsten Dunst has an equally small role as Camille, the mistress/eventual wife of Dean. But the performance that will gather the most attention is of course Kirsten Stewart, who looks incredibly young in here (it was only after seeing the movie that I came to realize this movie was filmed in 2010, yes, pre-Twilight: Breaking Dawn days, even though it is released AFTER both Twilight: Breaking Dawn movies came and went). Stewart does not hold back in the movie, and I thought she was very effective (and no, not because she did a number of nude scenes).

The movie works best as a ""road movie"", when the characters find themselves in places like Louisiana, Nebraska, Colorado, etc. Yet despite all that, I had trouble connecting emotionally with the characters, or put differently: I lacked an emotional investment in these characters, and that makes for a flawed movie (same issue I had with last year's ""Anna Karenina"" starring Keira Knightley or earlier this year's ""Upside Down"" starring Kirsten Dunst). I also feel that the running time of the movie is excessive for the amount of material covered by the movie (overlong by at least 30 min. in my book). I do not know why it has taken this long to get the movie from production in 2010 onto the theaters here in the US in early 2013 (the movie premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival). I had a chance to see this last Fall when I was in Belgium for a family visit, but couldn't get to it and in any event I thought it'd play in US theatres soon. I was wrong! The movie finally opened this past weekend here in Cincinnati and the screening I saw this at was poorly attended (3 people besides myself), so I cannot imagine this will play very long in the theatre. That aside, this is still worth checking out, warts and all.",1364774400,7,3186,4.597539543057996
5345169,4,B009KU2N7E,"There is bound to be a generational gap in the audience response to Walter Salles' and Jose Rivera's adaptation of Jack Kerouac's immensely important book ON THE ROAD, a story about the 'first beatnik'  who in the aftermath of WW II found the world not only confusing but senseless, and his way of trying to find his place as a writer spawned his book that is in many ways a diary of three years of living on the lam, penniless except for occasional odd jobs to finance gas, food and crash pads.  It  is a Whitmanesque song of independence and yearning for meaning and love and acceptance and Salles and Rivera, with considerable  assistance from the musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla and the cinematography of Eric Gautier.

The young unfocused writer Sal Paradise/Jack Kerouac (Sam Riley)is joined by free-spirited Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady (Garrett Hedlund in a magnificently realised portrayal) and his girl, Marylou/Luanne Henderson (Kristen Stewart) and Carlo Marx/Allen Ginsberg (Tom Sturridge)as they travel across the USA at breakneck speed, stopping in Denver and New York and other places trying to understand themselves and each other. They encounter a mix of people who each impact their journey indelibly: Old Bull Lee/William S. Burroughs  (Viggo Mortensen) and other less well known but important to the road trip played by such fine actors as Steve Buscemi, Amy Adams, Kirsten Dunst, Terrence Howard, Alice Braga, Elisabeth Moss, Danny Morgan and many more. The characters encounter and deal with drug abuse, sexual orgies, the entire spectrum of sexuality, marriage and children and divorce and above all the joys of freedom of place, of sex, of behavior, and of experiencing the kindness of strangers and the beauty of the countryside of America and Mexico. There is no true linear storyline and that will likely put off many viewers.

But in the end this long film is about a period of time of global fear regarding post WW II side effects and changes in the art and writing and interrelating  that forever changed our world. The film is an experience and to appreciate it the viewer must just relinquish credibility and simply go on the road. Grady Harp, March 13",1364256000,52,2188,4.991758241758242
5345170,2,B009KU2N7E,"I haven't felt this soiled since ""The Rum Diaries!"" This tawdry, drug-riddled, chain-smoking mumble-fest is confusing; the geography makes my head spin; the orgies, the threesomes, the shoplifting and car stealing are NOT funny; while the reckless driving and the survival with no visible means of support just strike me as irresponsible, NOT as a juvenile lark!

Yes, Jack Kerouac's ground-breaking novel is back On the Road again. This time we have an R-rated, two-hour (mumbled) talkathon. We see:
  * Sam Riley (""Brighton Rock"") as Sal Paradise/Jack Kerouac, a vaguely disengaged author in search of a story; he documents every move, every misdeed and every meal, but the sum total of all that labor is stultifyingly boring. (Yeah, that's probably not a word, but I don't care.)
  * Garrett Hedlund (""Country Strong"") as Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady is a good-looking omni-sexual legend who isn't above doing a little hooking to earn a ride.
  * Kristen Stewart (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") as Marylou/LuAnne Henderson personifies one of the many women who are used and discarded like soiled tissues.
  * Amy Adams (""Trouble With the Curve"") as Jane/Joan Vollmer lives at one of the many stops along the way. At least she can give marital tips to an unhappy young bride.
  * Tom Surridge (""Waiting For Forever"") as Carlo Marx/Allen Ginsberg is a Beat poet and iconoclast, ultimately revered as the Grand Old Man of his generation. I'm afraid I was always too grounded to relate to his toked-up brand of philosophy.
  * Kirsten Dunst (""Melancholia"") as Camille/Caroline Cassady who at least has sense enough to kick the guy out.
  * Viggo Mortensen (""A Dangerous Method"") as Old Bull Lee/William S. Burroughs. Mortensen threatens to replace Sam Shepard as Hollywood's favorite grizzled curmudgeon.

As you can see, this story that gives birth to a book was confusing, repugnant and endless (124 minutes), but I was impressed once again by Garrett Hedlund. We will see more of this guy as time passes. He is handsome, appealing, has a wonderful body, AND he can act! This movie proves it. I did NOT like this movie, but Hedlund, even as a repugnant character, is very watchable. When you get this from Amazon, you can re-play his scenes...smile...",1363996800,4,2250,5.008064516129032
5345171,4,B009KU2N7E,"The first third of Walter Salles' film seems dedicated to amplifying the book's title, as we see all three protagonists quite literally on the road as they travel round the United States in the immediate post-war period.  Sometimes the shot-selection becomes a bit repetitive, with long point-of-view shots of the characters looking through the windscreen at the open road.

As the narrative unfolds, so the movie develops thematically.  We discover the essential rootlessness of the characters; their search for something, even though they do know what that something is.  Hence their restlessness as they settle, but then feel the need to move on somewhere else.  The only stable aspect of their lives, it appears, is writing; the very act of setting pen to paper provides some kind of permanence in an otherwise evanescent existence.  The Kerouac-character discovers this, as we watch him recording his impressions on any scrap of paper he can find.

Stylistically speaking, Salles' film owes a lot to earlier works, notably John Ford's THE GRAPES OF WRATH, EASY RIDER (the late Dennis Hopper, one of the stars of that film, receives a posthumous credit in ON THE ROAD), and BONNIE AND CLYDE.  It's a long film - perhaps a little too long - but it is very good at recapturing the moment of the late 1940s/ early 1950s, as three men go in search of their identities.  Definitely worth a look.",1362096000,2,1394,4.923076923076923
5345172,5,B009KU2N7E,"A Book and Movie review of Jack Kerouac's ""ON THE ROAD - The Original Scroll""

I bought this book on August 19, 2007 after it was first published. I began to read it on January 8, 2013 (my cousin Ted's birthday) and finished reading it on January 14th, 2013 at 3:00 am in the morning - in preparation to see the movie!

On January 14, 2013, the official Jack Kerouac group in Lowell Massachusetts called ""Lowell Celebrates Kerouac!"" was scheduled to make a caravan trek into Boston to the AMC theater at the Boston Common on Tremont Street to see the movie made of the famous novel, ON THE ROAD, by Jack Kerouac - our belated and well-loved friend and literary mentor. Some of us had been waiting since 1957 to see this movie. It was a long time coming - and well worth the wait.

This review will cover both the book (in the ORIGINAL S CROLL form) as well as the movie, directed by the acclaimed filmmaker, Walter Salles of The Motorcycle Diaries fame (See my movie review of that great movie at amazon.com here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OQ81P4JMAOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview )

Jack Kerouac first wrote the original scroll version of ON THE ROAD in April of 1951 - but he had been working on it for years. According to the seven introductory prefaces to the ""Scroll"" version of ON THE ROAD, Jack Kerouac spent years of his life between 1947 and 1957 ""researching, ""working on, writing, editing, re-writing, and trying to get this book published. He believed in this book. To Jack Kerouac, it was not just his literary ""baby"" and second novel; it was a whole new way of approaching the art of writing in general and a whole new way of creating ""the great American novel"" in particular. Time has proven him right.

As my uncle, Billy Koumantzelis - who was a very close friend of Jack's in the later years of his life while living in Lowell - said in the White Eagle Caf where we all met in Lowell before embarking on out to Boston to see the movie, that it was ""time Jack got his due."" He was very pleased that the movie finally came out and that it was made so well - as a professional, dramatic, major motion picture about the life ""on the road"" that was immortalized in the book by his long lost friend. Make no mistake about it: ON THE ROAD is a great American novel - and this movie has done it justice.

During a recent phone conversation that I had with Mr. John Sampas - a man of true class and Jack Kerouac's brother-in-law who looks over the Estate of Jack's literary legacy - John said that he was very pleased with the work that was published by the four writers who he commissioned to write the introductory prefaces to ""the original scroll"" version of Jack's book. These introductory passages are as important to read as the book itself - and should be read before reading the book, as they elucidate both the circumstances surrounding Jack Kerouac's life at the time between the years of 1946 and 1951 as well as the subsequent history and , now, mythological status of the creation of ON THE ROAD.

The four writers who write the introductory prefaces to the scroll version of ON THE ROAD should all be commended for helping us all understand the whole story about this book. They are: Howard Cunnell, Penny Vlagopoulos, George Mouratidis, and Joshua Kuppets. They all - each and every one of them - make excellent points in their essays and their contributions to this publication are formidable and substantial. I would not have appreciated the book - or the movie - as much as I did if I had not first read their introductory prefaces or essays. They were all very good. Because of their work, I learned that there are actually four different versions of ON THE ROAD: the original scroll version of 1951; a second, shorter, later, edited version to please the publisher;, a third, longer, later version that includes many pages of what was later to be published as VISIONS OF CODY; and the regular, traditional, well-known, edited version of the ""Cody"" third version that was finally published in 1957 by Viking Press. This book had definitely been put through the ringer!

If you are going to read ON THE ROAD, you absolutely must read the original scroll version that was published in 2007 by Viking Press / The Penguin Group with the blessings of John Sampas, Literary Representative of the Estate of Stella Sampas Kerouac; John Lash, Executor of the Estate of Jan Kerouac (Jack's deceased daughter); Nancy Bump; and Anthony M. Sampas (my old friend, Tony - and the nephew of the elder and now deceased Tony Sampas of ""Nicky's Bar"" where Jack hung out in Lowell with Tony and his friend Billy Koumantzelis, now called ""Ricardo's"") - who all own the combined Copyrights to the book. Bless their hearts for finally releasing this for the world to read - as well as for allowing the original scroll itself to be exhibited in Lowell, Massachusetts at the Boot Mills Museum of the Lowell Historical National Park at the confluence of John and French Streets, right up the block from the Jack Kerouac Park where the beautiful monuments by the sculptor, Ben Woitena, pay tribute to the literary legacy of Lowell's most famous son.

I read the regular version of ON THE ROAD as a paperback in January of 1974. Let it be known right here and now: there is no comparison! When you read the original scroll version, it is just like Jack is talking to you. No kidding. It is not hard to read; it is not hard to understand; it is not boring and vulgar and crazy. People who say that don't know what they are talking about. People who say that are intellectually lazy, literally ignorant, and just plain stupid. They got it all wrong! If anything, it is very lucid, very comprehensive, and very descriptive of the main character's internal thoughts as well as of his surroundings. He captures America as it is. His scope is as deep as the Grand Canyon and as wide as the Mississippi River (which he loved like the Merrimack, according to Roger Brunelle). His writing is panoramic and cinematographic. It is as if he thinks like a panning, moving, movie camera - but one which makes the deepest and most descriptive audio commentary along the way of both the external surroundings as well as of the narrator's deepest thoughts and feelings concerning and influenced by those surroundings. It is truly incredible writing. Also: it is funny as hell. ... Jack Kerouac had a great sense of humor; that comes across explicitly when you are reading the scroll. His passion and compassion are profound. He is not just a man of words. He is not just a man about town. He is a man on a mission - a mission to immortalize America as he saw it and as he and his buddies experienced it.

Check out this great Footnote from the bottom of page 32 of Howard Cunnell's excellent introductory essay, ""Fast This Time: Jack Kerouac and the Writing of On the Road"":

*Interviewed in the documentary On the Road to Desolation (David Stewart, dir., BBC / NVC Arts Corporation, 1997), Giroux said: ""I would say in the first half of 1951, I was at my desk at Harcourt, Brace, and the phone rang and it was Jack, and he said, `Bob, I've finished it!' and I said, `Oh great, Jack, that's wonderful news.' He said, `I want to come over.' I said, `What, right now?' He said, `Yeah, I have to see you, I have to show you ...' I said, `Okay, come on, come over to the office.' We were on Forty-sixth Street and Madison Avenue. He came into the office looking ... high, looking, you know ... drunk, and he had a big roll of paper, like a paper towel like you use in the kitchen, big roll of paper under his left arm, and he was, you know ... This was a great moment for him, I understood that. He took one end of the roll and he flung it right across my office like a big piece of confetti, right across my desk, and I thought, `This is a strange manuscript. I've never seen a manuscript like this."" And he looked at me, waiting for me to say something. I said, `Jack, you know you have to cut this up. It has to be edited.' And his face flushed, and he said, ""There'll be no editing on this manuscript.' I said, `Why not, Jack?' He said, `This manuscript has been directed by the Holy Ghost.""

Indeed! ...

There are numerous notes of multiple examples from these introductory pages that I took which add even further illumination onto the writing of this book - and the inspiration of this movie, which the director and the filmmaker used as his guide in the creation of the film, even having come to Lowell to see the Scroll with his own eyes when it was on exhibit and, as my friend Mike Flynn recently noted in his essay in Howl In Lowell on the journey to see the film, was a great turning point and ""Eureka!"" moment for Walter Salles in his quest to translate the book into a motion picture - but there is not enough time and space to include them all here.
I will quote three passages from the book itself now that will prove what a great writer that Jack Kerouac was. It will also prove that he had more on his mind than the mere chasing of kicks. It shows a profoundly deep and broad understanding at a young age of the underlying and all-permeating spiritual nature of reality. He was truly a seer.

From pages 248 and 249:

Bill rode into town with us and went right on talking. ""Take it easy Neal, we'll get there. I hope; hup, there's the ferry, you don't have to drive us clear into the river."" He held on. Neal had gotten worse since Texas, he confided in me. ""He seems to me to be headed for his ideal fate, which is compulsive psychosis dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence."" He looked at Neal out of the corner of his eye. ""If you go to California with this madman you'll never make it. Why don't you stay in New Orleans with me. We'll play the horses over to Graetna and relax in my yard. I've got a nice set of knives and I'm building a target. Some pretty juicy dolls downtown too, if that's in your line these days."" He snuffed. We were on the ferry and Neal had leaped out to lean over the rail. I followed, but Bill sat on in the car snuffling. There was a mystic wraith of fog over the brown waters that night, together with dark driftwoods; and across the way New Orleans glowed orange bright, with a few dark ships at her hem, ghostly fogbound Cereno ships with Spanish balconies and ornamental poops, till you got up close and saw they were just old freighters from Sweden and Panama. The ferry-fires glowed in the night; the same Negroes plied the shovel and sang. Old Big Slim Hubbard had once worked on the Algiers as a ferry deckhand; this made me think of Mississippi Gene too; and as the river poured down from mid-America by starlight I knew, I knew like mad that everything I had ever known and would ever know was One.

Jack Kerouac capitalized the last word in that sentence - One - intentionally. ... As I always like to say: ALL IS ONE. You may be enlightened and know this already - or you may know it and not truly believe it - but Jack Kerouac knew it, believed it, and tried to live up to it. It was part of the essence of his basic spirituality as well as what made him tick. For from this realization - knowing that, indeed, ALL IS ONE - comes true human compassion. Call it Buddhist; call it Christian; call it whatever you want. The man had it.

Also, the passage from this book - though not the part about the ferry - is touched upon in some of the dialogue in the movie when Jack and Neal and Lou Anne go to visit William Burroughs and leave off their traveling companion, there to re-join his new bride and wife, brilliantly played by ""Peggy"" in the TV series, MAD MEN. If you don't laugh your head off during this scene, you have no sense of humor. During this episode, the movie is even better than book in some ways. Uncle Billy always says that he admired and enjoyed meeting William Burroughs with Jack when they travelled to New York City together with Joe Chaput. He called Burroughs a true southern gentleman - and that he was - and it comes across quite clearly in this movie. The man had soul, and Viggo Mortensen captures him to a T. The scene of him going into the Wilhelm Reich-inspired, orgone-collecting outhouse is a hoot! (The Reich Museum is in Rangeley, Maine.)

To further my point that Jack Kerouac was an enlightened sage and not just a young stud after sex, drugs, and Jazz (which in the earliest sense of the meaning of that word was American Black slang and code for SEX), check out this short passage from page 308:

It was a hot afternoon. Reno, Battle Mountain, Elko, all the towns along the Nevada road shot by one another and at dusk we were in the Salt Lake flats with the lights of Salt Lake City infinitesimally glimmering almost a hundred miles across the mirage of the flats, twice-showing, above and below the curve of the earth, one clear, one dim. I told Neal that the thing that bound us all together in this world was invisible: and to prove it pointed to long lines of telephone poles that curved off out of sight over the bend of a hundred miles of salt. His floppy bandage, all dirty now, shuddered in the air; his face was a light --- ""Oh yes man, dear God, yes, yes!""

That thing that bids us all together - that illusive ""IT,"" that ring that, as Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead sings on BLUES FOR ALLAH, can never be reached and just slips away when we try - is always right there, right under our noses, the whole time. STAR WARS calls it ""The Force."" It is very real, and it is explained very well by Ervin Laszlo in his book, Science and the Akashik Field of which you can read my review at amazon.com here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OQ81P4JMAOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview) ... There is a scene in the movie where Neal is driving his old Hudson through a snowstorm, with the windshield all covered with snow, and his head, wrapped around with a scarf, is sticking out the window in order to see the road up ahead before him so that he can drive the car, and it captures the essence of this last passage in the book.

Finally, there is this third and last passage from page 381:

The boys were sleeping and I was alone in my eternity at the wheel and the road ran straight as an arrow. Not like driving across Carolina, or Texas, or Arizona, or Illinois; but like driving across the world and into the places where we would finally learn ourselves among the worldwide fellaheen people of the world, the Indians that stretch in a belt around the world from Malaya to India to Arabia to Morocco to Mexico and over to Polynesia. For these people were unmistakably Indians and were not at all like the Pedros and Panchos of silly American lore --- they had high cheekbones, and slanted eyes, and soft ways --- they were not fools, they were not clowns --- they were great grave Indians and they were the source of mankind and the fathers of it. And they knew this when we passed, ostensibly self-important moneybag Americans on the lark in their land, they knew who was the father and who was the son of antique life on earth, and made no comment. For when destruction comes to the world people will stare with the same eyes from the caves of Mexico as well as from the caves of Bali, where it all began and where Adam was suckled and taught to know. These were my growing thoughts as I drove the car into the hot sunbaked town of Victoria where we were destined to spend the maddest afternoon of our entire lives.

Wow! ... The humanity of this man is truly outstanding. He identifies totally with the Native American and other First Nation native peoples across the planet. Knowing that he was part Native American himself (Mohawk from the Iroquoian-speaking peoples of Canada), he could relate and empathize with the plight of the original Americans of this great continent.

It is not my intention to spoil the reading of this book for you - or to spoil the viewing of this movie for you - but you need to understand that there was a lot more to Jack Kerouac than the constant portrayal of someone smoking yet again another cigarette, drinking another glass of whiskey (Uncle Billy says he preferred Hennesy Cognac), gyrating ecstatically on the dance floor before a live jazz band; falling into the arms of another sexy and loving woman in bed, taking peyote down in Mexico, smoking marijuana any chance he could get, or wandering around hitchhiking across the country like a bum with a backpack over his shoulders (a backpack which now resides in a protective glass case in the Mogan Cultural Center Museum on French Street in Lowell, Massachusetts). No. These are allof the superficial images that the unknowing attribute to him as the only things that characterized him. None of these activities defines Jack Kerouac or the totality of the man: his heart, his mind, his personality, his soul. His was a great spirit in every respect - and this comes across in both the book and the movie, if you read and watch closely.

Sure, this book was originally censored and edited and cut to pieces by the conservative consensus reality mindset of the editors and publishers of his day. But thanks to Jack Kerouac - and to all of his other writings, as well as to those of his friends like Corso, and Ginsberg, and Burroughs, and Ferlinghetti, and others - this movie of ON THE ROAD, 56 years later, will not be censored (though I am sure it was edited, and I long to see the Director's Cut on Blu-ray disc soon!) The movie is great! ... Yes, it is Rated R - and with good reason (Would you have it any other way?). The R stands for: rambunctious, raucous, reckless, restless, rowdy, and most definitely raw; but it also stands for religious, righteous, rebellious (in a good way - against the consumerist madness of the military industrial complex mindset of the times), and most definitely real. Yes, it does not get any more REAL than this.

As for ""religious,"" people need to realize that there are more forms of religion than conservative sects of Christianity. There are even some people in the world - like the ancient Kalash people, descended from the soldiers of Alexander the Great, in Afghanistan and Pakistan - who still worship the ancient Greek god, Dionysus. Ever been to a Grateful Dead concert? The great modern mythologist, Joseph Campbell himself, has been noted as saying that it is the closest thing to an exhibition of uninhibited Dionysian revelry that he has ever experienced. So, yes - ON THE ROAD - both the book and the movie are ""religious"" in the truest sense of that word. Both the book and the movie portray religious experiences firsthand. In one sense, what isn't a religious experience? ...

Jack Kerouac has finally got his due, indeed ... and there is more to come down that Pacific Coast Highway than meets the eye - very soon!

5345173,3,B009KU2N7E,"It will take more than a few extras to make anything better of this movie, which was quite a disappointment after so many years in the making.  Francis Ford Coppola bought the film rights to the book decades ago and had long been searching for the right director to carry out his vision.  He thought he had found his man in Walter Salles after watching Motorcycle Diaries, but Walter appeared more comfortable on the road in South America than he did North America.  Of course, the book is much tougher to tackle, as there isn't a linear story despite that which the title implies.

The result is a chronicle of a set of trips over a three-year period (1948-51) written as a stream of consciousness.  Salles would have been wiser to go with the scroll, which he shows in the end, instead of a rather conventional road movie that relies on way too many melodramatic devices.  Yet, Sam Riley, Garret Hedlund, Kristen Stewart, Tom Sturridge, Kirsten Dunst, and Viggo Mortensen all look the parts.  Too bad they couldn't fill out their roles.  Most of the scenes felt contrived.  That sense of wild abandonment that spurred Sal and Dean onward was missing.  Salles had Sal Paradise brooding way too much over his book, fastidiously scribbling notes along the way, while Dean more or less stumbled from one place to another unable to get out from under the shadow of his father.

Viewers expect more after so many years in waiting, especially those who have read the book.  The scroll version came out a few years ago, which has the real names as opposed to the pen names that appear in the classic version of the book.  If Salles wanted the movie to feel like it came from the pages of Kerouac, he would have been wiser to have Jack sitting in front of his typewriter, loaded on benzedrine, as he furiously typed out the words over a fortnight after struggling so many years to get his words down on paper.  The scenes could have literally flown from the pages, to hell with a linear course of events.  Sadly, another missed opportunity.",1356566400,16,2033,4.608333333333333

5345224,5,B009KU2N7E,"Most of my literary friends who love the book have also deemed it ""unfilmable."" But I think this film is a rare example of an adaptation that seeks to be its own piece of art and not just a line-for-line remake of a novel. Let's face it--that would be impossible. Do not look for a depiction of the real-life Kerouac and Cassady in this film. You won't find them. Hedlund plays a Dean that takes you by surprise. I actually think Dean is a little more human in this film than he is in the book; less of a superman, more of a troubled escapist.

Basically don't go into this film with a cynical, purist attitude. And if you agree with my friends that the novel is ""unfilmable,"" keep in mind that this is the same writer/director team that brought you Motorcycle Diaries, and the same cinematographer that brought you Into the Wild, which was nothing like its journalistic source material and wasn't meant to be. This film does not try to be an adaptation; it attempts to show us how the restless and frenetic Beat Generation sought the break from the shadows of the men that came before them.

In conclusion, don't think of this film as an adaptation. Think of it as a period piece about the Beat Generation. Also, get a torrent of the Sundance version, which is edited much better.",1459123200,,1281,4.47008547008547

5345264,4,B009KU2N7E,"On the Road is an adventure film directed that is an adaptation of the classic novel of the same title by Jack Kerouac. The story is based on the years Kerouac spent travelling the United States in the late 1940's with his friend Neal Cassady and several other figures who would go on to fame in their own right.

Soon after the death of his father in New York in 1947, Sal Paradise, a young writer, meets Dean Moriarty, a charismatic, easy-going, hedonistic young man who loves to party, smoke pot, and occasionally steal cars. Dean is adored by his wife, Marylou, and soon Sal joins them on a trip where Dean is also involved with Camille. Determined not to get locked in to a constricted life, the two friends cut their ties and take to the road with Marylou. Thirsting for freedom, the three young people head off in search of the world, of other encounters, and of themselves.

The filmmakers are intelligent and gifted, but they fail to provide a satisfying answer to the question facing anyone who might want to make a movie version of this particular Jack Kerouac's novel as to,""Why bother?"".Despite the fact that the story is laced with sex, drugs and nudity,it could have been capable character study of a group of young friends who could be part of any generation. Unfortunately,this pretty period-pictorial companion piece to the novel fatally misses out on the brain-firing raw buzz that Kerouac felt and passed on to his readers as it was an uninspired film that fails to grab the viewer's attention with its meandering storyline and characters that drift in and out of the picture.

Still-this movie does a decent goof showing the story itself. It isn't perfect, but it's good. There is no way to perfectly adapt the books of the beats, because there is a feel and cadence to the words themselves-the words are every bit as important as the story-they are too integral to the entire work.

There are millions of ""On the Road"" stories out there that will never get published that would make Kerouac's pale in comparison!

I enjoyed the movie, good acting and the story was definitely, different (how much really happened, I wouldn't hazard a guess)!

That said, I've got to get a copy of his book (un-expurgated, of course) to do a comparison/contrast! (Stay tuned)

5345315,4,B009KU2N7E,"I recently watched ""On the Road"" - the film adaptation of the classic, iconoclastic beat novel by Jack Kerouac. I read the novel decades ago, so it was interesting to see how the book was adapted on-screen. ""On the Road"" was the defining work of the postwar beat generation, and the book (and the film) was a noble attempt to capture the countercultural dark side of Americana during this period.

Certainly, the novel On the Road is one that many critics have hailed as great for decades, ever since it was published in 1957. Time Magazine, for instance, selected the novel as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.
It is interesting that even though the novel was published in 1957, no one had ever dared to make it into a movie until recently. Watching the film prompted me to read several biographical accounts on the web about Kerouac and his cast of fellow beats, such as Neal Cassady. What's interesting is that the movie, like the novel, is a roman  clef. This means that it is an autobiographical work based on the real life experiences of Kerouac, but overlaid with a faade of fiction.

As a roman  clef, ""On the Road"" features key figures in the Beat Generation (""beatniks"") of the late 1940s and 50s, but refers to them by other names, such as Neal Cassady (Dean Moriarty), William S. Burroughs (Old Bull Lee) and Allen Ginsberg (Carlo Marx). Even Kerouac himself, as the narrator, is referred to as Sal Paradise. Knowing the real identities and backgrounds of the characters helped me to better understand what was happening as I watched the film adaptation of the novel.

Produced by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, the film features an excellent ensemble cast, including Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley, Kristen Stewart, Alice Braga, Amy Adams, Tom Sturridge, Danny Morgan, Elisabeth Moss, Kirsten Dunst, and Viggo Mortensen. In particular, Hedlund was memorable in his role as Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady). He reminded me of a few semi-crazy friends Ive had over the years who were like burning candles in the wind; living life to the extreme for a time, but destined to burn out at a fairly young age.

The movie certainly seemed a bit disjointed and plotless at times; but was also fun to watch as the characters went from city to city on their transcontinental voyage. As in the novel, we see the seamy side of vintage Americana, with sex, drugs, booze, and be-bop jazz encounters at every pit stop along the way. But the movie also reminded me of the importance of friendship, and how strong bonds between friends are formed through mutual experiences; and how we can learn from friends, even though such friendships are often ephemeral.

The movie also reminded me of some of my own travels, though without the hedonistic excesses  especially when I have gone on impromptu interstate road trips with friends, or walked through cities around the world and encountered various subcultural/countercultural domains in town squares, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, live music venues, and coffee shops.
If you want some crazy escapism, combined with a nostalgic view of countercultural America that includes cool vintage cars, sizzling jazz performances, and other aspects of the iconoclastic underbelly of the late 1940s and 50s, then you should check out the film, On the Road.",1419724800,,3316,4.919499105545617

Let's judge this film as the film it is:  episodic, meandering, somewhat titillating, lacking in plot development.  Many of the scenes seem to be present only to shock, or to cater to our more prurient interests.  It is difficult to have empathy with any of the characters, nor does there seem to be any sort of lesson to be learned from observing their excursions through life.  The pace is slow, not like the speeding car this road trip should have.  This film has almost nothing to recommend it for.  I'll give it an E for Effort.

5345350,5,B009KU2N7E,"(Though my partner Tom's name may appear on the linked account, this review is by Bruce P. Grether.)

Many citizens of the USA have a romantic fixation concerning the landscape of this vast nation, its variety, and the cultural differences of regions, such as the East, West, North, South and the Middle, all imbued with their own character, beauty, and mystique. The classic novel by Jack Kerouac, On the Road, touches into all of these, as well as depicting a rich assortment of human characters.

Like many readers and writers, I have waited a long time for On the Road to come to the screen. One major challenge to such a visual adaptation is that Kerouacs beautiful, quirky and inspired prose in the novel is not easy to translate visually. There is a kind of poetry and heart to his best writing that must be heard and felt, as much as seen. Still, the film offers exquisite cinematography, and fine performances by the entire cast. Though I appreciate the choice to use Kerouacs fictional character names, this may confuse some viewers unless they research on Wikipedia.

As with the novel, the major focus is what we now call a classic bromance between the narrator (the character Kerouac based on himself) and his good friend and inspiration based on that famous wild man Neal Cassady. There are several layers of romantic fixation going on here, for Kerouac crafted most of his works by recording his own life and friendships through a kind of romanticized filter. His novels ended up as accounts of how he wanted to see things, and often quite different from how others viewed events.

This beautiful film mostly honors Kerouacs version of things, though there are touches of biography added that are not so flattering, such as the wonderful performance of Kirsten Dunst, as the woman who married Cassadys character. Though her role is relatively small, she achieves special luminosity and poignance. Also exceptional are Garrett Hedlund as the Cassady character, who brilliantly convinces with his rakish charm. The unexpected casting of Viggo Mortensen as the character inspired by William S. Burroughs, is a brilliant vignette, and quite true to life.

No doubt my view of the film is colored by my own fascination with the Beat Generation, whose works and lives Ive studied for decades. My partner who is not so fixated said, The film seems to be about three things: substance abuse, male bonding, and abuse of women. Though I cannot disagree, to me the film, like the novel, provides a depiction of how certain people can light up others lives with enthusiasm and inspiration; this may even translate into the creation of writing and art.

Though creativity does not require irresponsible behavior, the other side of the equation is the free spirits that defy convention, and question external authority. For anyone interested in the literary and cultural history of modern times, On the Road is definitely worthwhile. Im less certain what I feel about how the film ends, and yet in a real sense, that conclusion was only the beginning of much else.",1395360000,6,3065,4.9073359073359075
5345351,4,B009KU2N7E,"I have read Kerouac's work numerous times and studied his legacy. People need to realize that a film about a book is a snapshot. It is like the Cliff Notes version with moving pictures. If you filmed any book word for word you would be staring at a 6 hour plus movie that was boring as hell. They did the best they could to try to capture Kerouac's language onto film. It is a hard task to do and I feel they were great at capturing key moments in the book. It needs to be understood that a ""film"" is just a mere adaption of the book. They did a fine job with exception plot and that is not their fault because the book basically had no plot. Kerouac was more of the historian of his crowd more than he was a fiction author. I would put him and Hunter S. Thompson into the same category. They were journalist who represented the counter culture and opened the world's eyes to a different view. This film gives us a sneak peek into a different time.",1394496000,,948,4.157608695652174

Unfortunately, this film adds scenes that may have happened in real-life, but that were not in the book.  It doesn't matter why Kerouac left out certain things about the sexual nature of the relationship between Dean and Carlo.  In the book, he focused on their intellectual and spiritual bond (a bond that somewhat excluded him), but he did never imply that they were lovers.  It was wrong to put those things in while leaving out other key scenes such as the Opera House, Sal's time working with Remi as a barracks cop, his hunger-induced hallucination in the Greek diner window, and other parts of the book that did not involve Dean.
Also, maybe to attract today's young and scruffy hipsters, they got the hair all wrong.  Jack and Neal wore their hair combed and slick, not hanging over their ears, eyes, and collars as in the movie.
If it brings young readers to appreciate Kerouac's writing, then that is good.  But, as in his own life and career, the focus was misplaced on the reality and not on the fine fiction Kerouac created out of that reality.",1390780800,2,1157,4.5603864734299515

I at least got close enough to smell the reality, but this sad movie stinks.

Some favorite actors, yes, but neither Dean Moriarty nor Sal as played here were even close to the reality. Perhaps the actions followed the truth, but the characters were cheerless caricatures of what they would have had to be to carry this off.

5345397,1,B009KU2N7E,"When I was breaking through my teen years, I read a lot of Kerouac. I always thought On The Road would make an absolutely beautiful film. The lushness of the storytelling and the vastness of the landscape is everything you might want in a visual epic. Although I thought The Subterraneans is a better book, most people have never read it.

I've been avoiding the movie they made with Kristen Stewart in 2012 as I just knew it would be like paint thinner upon my soul. I couldn't even get ten minutes in before I recognized the parts of the story they were trying to tell and then parts they just decided to make up for no reason at all. The rest was just mangled and poor. Or rather 'Unspeakably distasteful"" to quote Bull Lee.

I guess there's a window of opportunity for a story like On The Road to be made and treated appropriately. I think they completely missed it for an entire generation. They should've made it at the tail end of the 90s when Hollywood was full of capable actors who were brimming with intrigue and bearing. Depp, Del Toro, Slater, McConnaghey, Mortenson, even Afflecks, Casey and Ben, both. Casey as Gregory Corso. Yes. Affleck as Ginsberg. I can see it.

Yeah, I get Viggo Mortensen as Old Bull Lee, but rewind about 10 years and he would've been a better Kerouac / Sal Paradise and McConnaughey his wild-eyed sidekick Dean Moriarity.

5345420,4,B009KU2N7E,"I first read Kerouac's most famous work nearly 40 years ago when I was in college and working my way through a lot of the classic counterculture books.  I became a big fan and collected everything I could find on Jack and the other Beat writers.  I never gave much thought about them becoming a film, though I knew that Kerouac had wanted a movie made of Road.  There was a poorly received version of The Subterraneans that was filled with beatnik cliches and a very whitewashed plot (literally - the African American characters were played by white people). On The Road sat in Hollywood preproduction for over fifty years and most fans assumed it would never be made.  Beat literature was considered to be too nonlinear to make a coherent story.  Then came a film of The Naked Lunch and it was actually good.  Even Howl has recently appeared on screen.  So I got pretty excited when I heard that Road was finally being made.
  But I had to put my hopes in check when I read that Kristen Stewart was going to play Marylou. I wondered just who the studios were aiming the film at - though I had to admit that Stewart had done a pretty good job of playing Joan Jett in The Runaways. That Walter Salles was producing also seemed positive - The Motorcycle Diaries was well done. So I kept my expectations low and waited for the film to play at the local art cinema. There were delays in the release that didn't bode well, but it eventually appeared.  And I came away happy.
  Of course it isn't perfect - there was never a possibility that it would be - but it is far better than a lot of the reviews here are making it sound. So let me shoot down some of the criticisms:
  If you are a sixteen year old Twilight fan, you won't get this movie, so I'll ignore any comments from that direction.
  If you haven't read the book you will have a bit harder time understanding what is going on - of course a movie must stand on it's  own, but the whole atmosphere of the times is easier to appreciate if you have some background information.
  If you are a social conservative, you won't like the lifestyles depicted.
  If you saw this on streaming video it was - judging from other comments - edited for content. The Blu-ray is the same I saw in the theaters.
  So now I'll direct my comments toward those who love the book, but were disappointed in the film.  Yes a lot of things were left out - though some of them appear in the deleted scenes. The released version was shortened from the one that was shown at Cannes, which makes sense - scenes such as the Ghost of the Susquehanna are incomprehensible to someone that hasn't read the book, but they're on the disc as extras. I think I might have liked the Cannes cut even better.
  Then there is the complaint that there is too much sex,drugs and decadence.  Well, right before I saw the film, I read the recently released Original Scroll version of the book and all of those things are in it - turns out Kerouac had to tone it down in order to get it published.
  That doesn't mean that I don't think the movie couldn't have been improved. Dean (Neal Cassady) isn't quite manic enough and there isn't enough Bebop jazz (though the Mexican brothel Mambo scene was done well). Jazz and living on the edge were major components of Beat life.
  Perhaps with time this movie will be better appreciated. And hopefully it will inspire more Kerouac flicks - maybe they can get The Subterraneans done right.",1382572800,4,3443,4.391785150078989
5345421,5,B009KU2N7E,"I did like the movie, but would have liked to see more well-known stars

5345422,3,B009KU2N7E,"Although I've always considered ""On the Road"" essentially unfilmable, as someone who loves Kerouac's writing, I really wanted this film to succeed. But while it was better than I'd feared, it still wound up being unsatisfying in the end, even though it was well-made & had some vivid & effective scenes.

The problem, as I'd suspected, is that it's extremely difficult to create a cinematic equivalent of Kerouac's prose. We see what happens in the book; but of course what really matters isn't just what happens, but how the narrator/writer feels about it & writes about it. There's plenty of hedonism & wildness on-screen, as well as too much graphic sex for the good of the picture (though I salute the film's forthright depiction of Dean Moriarity's cheerful pansexuality). We get plenty of surface, much of it electric; but there's isn't very much beneath that surface. The intellectual & spiritual dimensions of the book are lost for the most part; you get more of a feel for that from the brief appearances of Carlo Marx (Allen Ginsberg), for example. And they've quite clearly added material taken from the biographies of the main characters that doesn't necessarily appear in the novel, as if they couldn't quite decide between outright biopic & novel adaptation. (Granted, the line between the two in this case is paper-thin.)

For me, there was also a certain distancing effect. I was all too aware that I was watching actors playing roles, rather than simply seeing the characters. ""Oh, there's Steve Buscemi doing a cameo!"" That sort of thing. ""Here I am playing Kerouac, er, Sal Paradise, in Mexico; here I am playing Cassady, er, Dean Moriarity, listening to jazz."" I'm always aware of the actors working at their roles; they never seem to fully inhabit the characters they're playing. As I say, everyone does his or her best. But it just remains largely flat as a film, ending on a morose note, with a shot of Moriarity/Cassady walking down a train track, an obvious reference to where & how he died. There's plenty of frenetic excitement & movement in the film to be sure, but not a lot of joy.

I remain curious & hopeful about the upcoming film of ""Big Sur"", and still think that ""The Dharma Bums"" could be quite successfully adapted into film.

And I do think it's kind of cool that while the film put across a good feel for that particular era, it seemed to avoid being a ""period piece"" at the same time.  I thought that all of the actors were first rate - and that Kristen Stewart was outstanding, as well as being hot as a firecracker, in her role.  I really appreciate how the filmmakers related to the novel through their own artistic vision of the film, too.  I mean, what better way to introduce Dean than by watching him park those cars?!  But I think that Sal (Kerouac) wasn't portrayed in as multi-faceted of a way as the character is in the book; that while Sal was indeed cool and adventurous and level-headed at times, he was also, at other times, extremely neurotic, thoroughly under-confident and kind of a jerk when the booze got the best of him.  In other words, at his worst, the film's Sal Paradise seemed just mildly depressed.  (And OK - he didn't want to be in a ""threesome"".)  But hey, if the filmmakers wished to romanticize Jack Kerouac as Sal Paradise in that way, it was their move to make.  Mainly, I enjoyed the film a heck of a lot, I thought it was beautifully shot, and best of all, it seemed like a labor of love for all involved.

5345524,2,B009KU2N7E,"I should start by saying that the novel On the Road is a novel that presents serious challenges to anyone hoping to make it into a movie. There is probably a reason that this is the first (as far as I know) attempt to make the book into a movie. The book is not structured by a traditional plot: central conflict, climax, resolution. The book is about four separate journeys, the frantic search of a group of young writers, poets, and petty criminals for ""it"", some unachievable ideal. It would be very difficult to turn all of that into a coherent film so I was prepared for some pretty radical departures from the book. I was not disappointed in that regard, there were major deviations, but I do not think they were ultimately all that successful in turning the book into a coherent or interesting movie.

The movie opens with some truly cringe worthy scenes of Carlo Marx (Ginsberg) reading some god-awful poetry and a heart to heart talk between Sal and Dean about their fathers, a scene that was entirely made up. Virtually every made up scene in the movie was cringe worthy to me. Whoever wrote the adaptation was clearly trying to ape Kerouac's style, which, admittedly would be difficult for anyone, but they were not really very successful. I also do not think that the soundtrack worked all that well. They had a good idea: use jazz. Jazz plays a big role in the book. Ultimately, I don't think it worked. There were scenes that I think would have been more powerful if they had been differently scored.

I could also tell right away that there was not going to be any of the frantic energy of the book. They try, but again, they do not succeed. They also fail with most of the characters. Dean has none of the charisma and frantic energy that he has in the book. It is impossible to imagine why anyone would follow Dean, or put up with his non-sense, from this movie. In the book, it is clear that, as horrible as Dean can be to the people around him, he has some mysterious quality that draws people to him. They fail, in my opinion, to capture that in this movie. He is not only a con-man, he is dull and boring. The only characters I thought the movie handled well were Carlo Marx and Old Bull Lee (Ginsberg and Burroughs). All the other characters seemed flat and boring to me (MaryLou was on the border of interesting, maybe crossing it in a few moments).

The movie also feels like it is just a bunch of fragmented scenes that do not really add up to a movie. I knew they were going to have to take a lot of license with the book but, if you are going to deviate as much as they did, they might as well put in a story, turn it into something coherent. They add a bunch of stuff that does not really add much to the overall story (like Carlo's homosexual relationship with Dean which, as far as I know, is historically accurate, but was not emphasized in the book). Carlo's relationship with Dean is just an isolated episode. So why take the license if it is not adding anything? There were a number of scenes that were totally made up that, in my opinion, had no purpose. Even the scenes that were taken directly from the book were not that interesting or powerful. I almost quit watching the movie out of boredom and I sort of drifted in and out for the last forty-five minutes or so.

The preview of this movie really made it look good. It looked like they had captured the spirit, if not the letter, of the book, but, I think, in this case, unfortunately, looks were deceiving.",1377648000,8,3498,4.385208012326657

5345526,4,B009KU2N7E,"Not so long ago, Jack Kerouac's ""On The Road"" was considered unfilmable. Stream of conscious, rambling and without a core narrative, I could see why it was considered unfilmable.

Yet, a noble attempt was made to adapt the novel to film. In many ways, the film is flawed. For one, the behaviors  that once seemed wild are now tame in comparison to the Internet/Reality TV age. Also, it takes place in an America that doesn't exist anymore.

Still, to me, the first selling point of the movie, is cinematographer Eric Gaultier's gorgeous scenery. Director Walter Salles makes generous use of Gaultier's work along with composer Gustavo Santaoalla's score to help evoke that long-lost American landscape.

Interesting too is that the secondary and even less than secondary characters are probably more vivid than the narrator/lead character of Sal Paradise and his muse/focus, Dean Moriarty. From Bull Lee to the minor character of the Okie Hitchhiker, the characters who come into the story and back out were welcome respite from the rather dull Sal and the one-note Dean.

I didn't feel like the movie changed my opinion of the book and the flaws of the book made it into the movie, but I did feel that the women of On The Road were great and while they didn't get a lot of screentime, they made more of an impact than the book version allowed.

Overall, I did like the movie and while it didn't reach the level of Salles's ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" or ""Central Station"", Salles and his cast made a noble effort to bring to life a problematic classic American novel.",1377561600,,1565,4.777777777777778

Since then writers and directors have taken a crack at producing an ""On The Road"" film, but through the years the book has been judged as being ""unfilmable."" Francis Ford Coppola has been involved with ""On The Road"" since at least 1994 and there was great hope he could film the unfilmable, alas, I think ""On The Road"" remains unfilmable.

When I first read Kerouac's ""On The Road"" it left me breathless. ""On The Road"" the movie doesn't, it misses the poetry of Kerouac's writing and vision of America despite the frequent voice over quoting passages from the book. Kerouac was a jazz writer, fast paced and improvisational like the jazz players he idolized, but the filmmakers chose to film a gritty almost noir version of ""On The Road."" Maybe the  filmmakers should have watched ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" the soundtrack of which has the frenetic jazz pace and tone that would have matched Kerouac's style.

Dean Moriarty was a fast talking conman, who could talk women into bed and the men into adventures in a car speeding across America. None of that comes through in Garret Hedlund's performance, instead of Benzedrine fueled speed (and they show the characters ingesting Benezdrine), Hedlund seems a slowed down barbituated Dean Moriarty. One of the attractions of Kerouac's ""On The Road"" is unbound joy and enthusiasm with which his characters attack life looking for the answers of existential questions in the search of experience and `kicks.' None of the actors in ""On The Road"" seem very joyful or exuberant about anything, they don't seem to be glad to be alive or feel the joy in the `kicks' Kerouac wrote about.

""On The Road"" remains, and probably will remain unfilmable because ""On The Road"" is an interior journey, the frenetic action of ""On The Road"" is just the scenery flashing by as Sal and Dean pass through on their real journey.

If you're looking for something more in the bonus features section you won't find it there, no backstory of Kerouac and his history or of the book, no behind the scenes insights into any part of the filmmaking process, only some deleted scenes which really wouldn't have mattered if they were included in the movie or not.",1377388800,3,2452,5.029556650246305

It kept my attention for two hours, and I found it quite beautiful in places, no matter how dissatisfying it proved to be in the end.

ON THE ROAD follows a linear, too-often patchy storyline (just like Life itself, eh?) The film really captures what it's like to be young and restless, but it would have been nice if the makers had found more to show us beyond all the scenes of Sal, Dean, and the others getting high and screwing. Sad thing is, this film had SO much potential and could have been something truly extraordinary with more character and plot development.

The biggest problematical element, however, is this: As several others have noted, Kerouac aficionados are bound to be disappointed by how little this film actually follows the original novel. On the other hand, those who are not familiar with Kerouac and the other ""beats"" will probably be left wondering who these people are and wth the meaning of all this is supposed to be.

All the same, aspiring writers will probably identify with everything ON THE ROAD shows us about the writing process. This film may at least prove helpful in reboosting sales of Kerouac's fine novel.",1376870400,2,1328,4.790393013100437
5345534,2,B009KU2N7E,"How do you make Twilight seem like a literary masterpiece? One way is to take a literary masterpiece and boil it down to orgies and drug binges.  On the Road manages to take the undulating mystery and frenetic discovery of Kerouac's work and turn it into exploitative drivel. I'm terming this Lit-xpoltation.

As a Teenager and young adult I read Kerouac, Burroughs, Bukowski and all those Beats. I even remember as a girl my parents took me to a reading of Howl in a local park. I was confused, but I still remember it. That said, as a grown-up lady I took a liking to the Twilight movies. I'm not ashamed. I'm a big fan vampires, brooding and unrequited love. Of course I mention Twilight because Kristin Stewart is featured in this film and did the whole press junket for this. And I can't help watching her in any film without thinking of her iconic roll. With that in mind, I feel that the producers of this film were appealing to the Twilight audience, presenting Dean and Sal as misunderstood outsiders trying to find the one place they belong- themes at the heart of Twilight. However, the producers of this film failed to deliver these themes with the level of heartbreaking ennui and transcendent redemption present in Twilight. (Yes, I just said that).

Dean and Sal were young in their road adventures, but they seemed older. And I think they were older  than their years in a sense. These guys grew up during WWII, the depression, and the aftermath of WWI were still very real during their childhood. This makes you old fast. My parents were a generation younger than these guys, but my dad was working at 6 and my mom left home at 13. That's serious stuff. Me on the other hand, and the much younger millennials will probably act like kids till we're collecting social security (ha- just kidding there won't be social security).  But the Dean and Sal in this picture are acting the way 20 somethings act now. Their exploits seem dull and greedy, instead of revolutionary and transcendent. They have made Dean and Sal into ""bros"" out to get a piece of tail, find out the hip new music and make a buck on it.

The ""bro""ization of Dean and Sal takes all the life out of Keroauc's work, and as I said to start makes Twilight seem like nuanced genius. I won't go into why that's dreadful, if you don't know that's dreadful, you'll probably like this thing.  The only reason I'd recommend watching this movie is if you are interested in the Beat Generation and feel like getting really indignant and want to show off your authentic love and knowledge of the work. Honestly, after a point I just watched this thing to see the oft talked about double handy Ms. Stewart gives to Dean and Sal. It was boring. All the sex in this movie is truly boring. It's all around, ready for the taking. I'm ok with sex sans romance, but sex sans tension or any point at all is not only dull but somehow worse than that, it like steals your life force. I mean if sex isn't interesting what is? Honestly, the most interesting sex scene is when Dean gives it to Steve Buscemi. Yes I said that.

Also Kirsten Dusnt is in this movie. Did you know that? I didn't. Evidently, she had enough sense to not highlight her lame roll in this lame picture.

As a final note, I watched a picture called ""Robot Monster"" on my Roku ""Drive-In Movie channel the same evening I saw this. It' about a space race that is part gorilla, part robot that comes to destroy earth.  I am confident I will remember that picture longer, and with more fondness than I did ""On the Road.""",1376784000,7,3546,4.475232198142415
5345535,3,B009KU2N7E,"There are a lot of mixed reviews about this movie and inevitably some generational gaps. I am not from the beat generation but I am not a tween either. I have read many of Kerouac's books and he is one of my top 10 favorite writers.

If you have never read the book this movie will not make a lot sense to you. You will not understand the characters, what they are doing or who they are essentially meant to portray in Kerouac's life. It will probably seem like a bunch of unrelated segments and may seem to drag on. My recommendation for those who have not read the book is to skip buying this movie and spend your money on a copy of the book. Read that 2 or 3 times then rent this movie.

For those who have read the book and are familiar with Kerouac's life should really keep things in perspective. A movie is very rarely ever as good as the book and it is difficult to cover everything in two hours. Although, I do agree this movie does not do the book justice and does tend to focus on the drugs/sex for the most part which doesn't bother me personally.

5345536,3,B009KU2N7E,"Well, we will always have memories of blasted out Frisco town in the late 1940s ready to take refugees, car-borne refugees, coming in from the cold war red scare Denver/Chi Town/Jersey Shore/Village/Lowell/Hullsville American dreaded night. We will always have Jack Kerouac's novel, On The Road, that sent one, maybe two generations, on the road, on the road to some mystical discovery thing, some search for language to explain our short existence, to make sense of thing in the modern world that has no time for reflection on the big cosmic questions.

We will always have Kerouac's finely wrought be-bop word plays jumping off the page out in the desolate 1950s a chicken in every pot and two cars (if not three) cars in every garage, in every suburban ranch house sub-division garage. We will always have Sal (a.k.a Jeanbon Kerouac) and Dean, Dean Moriarty (a.k.a. Neal Cassady), the father we did not know, could not know, while we were sitting on those Jersey shores, sweating out in those Ames cornfields, hell, even sitting on the seawall down in those old Hullsville beach fronts looking for the great blue-pink great Amercian West night.

We will always have Charlie, Sonny, Slim, Big Red, the Duke, blowing out, trying to reach and sometimes making it, that high white, after hours, after the paying customers, the carriage trade, went home to bed and they blew to heaven, or tried to, with the boys, with the guys who knew when that note floated out some funky cellar bar door winding its way down to the harbor.

We will always have Sal, Carlos, Bull, Dean and an ever changing assortment of , well, women, women, mainly, at their beck and call, riding, car-riding, riding hard over the hill and dale of this continent searching, well, just searching okay. We will always have the lost brothers, Sal and Dean, playing off of each other's strengths (and weaknesses) as they try to make sense of their world, or if not sense then to keep high, keep moving, and keep listening. And we will always have a great American novel to pass on to the next wanderlust generation, if there is another wanderlust generation.

And that is exactly what is wrong with this long time in the making film adaptation of Kerouac's cultural coming- of- age novel. I looked forward with great anticipation to the film, and came away with fair- sized disappointment. Not with the main actors, Sam Riley, Garret Hedlund and Kristie Stewart since they were confined by the constricts of the way the director (and screen-writers) wanted to play the novel. Take away the drugs, sex, rock and roll (oops, be-bop jazz), and, oh yah, driving at high speed and/or hitchhiking, and there is no glue holding this thing together.

Now no one can complain, or such complaints will go for naught after watching this film, that Kerouac was, frankly very oblique in his sexual references, and certainly in the amount of time he spent on discussing the ins and out of sex in the novel so it was quite disconcerting to find so much time spent on the sex scenes. Moreover, let's face it women for the men, and it was mainly men, of the Beat generation women were ornaments, or drudges and while it does no good to project today's mores backward they were kept around because as Dean/Neal shouted out one time ""I love women."" End of story.

While Road is not strictly a buddy film I came out of the watching the film thinking that maybe, just, maybe it is impossible to put the novel in cinematic form, there is perhaps too much stream of consciousness, too much introspection, too much angst to corral on film. We will however always have the novel, praise be.",1376697600,,3630,4.726698262243286

It is well known that the characters of the book are based on Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Cassady and many others...and we know quite a few of them were bisexual and had relationships in real life. Here's an idea, lets include those relationships in the book!

Doesn't work, the movie is not true to the movie. It could have been a fantastically great movie, instead its terrible. They left out everything that made the book such a great book and included things that have nothing to do with the book.

5345542,2,B009KU2N7E,"Director Walter Salles (""Dark Water"") and screen writer Jose Rivera take Jack Kerouac's famous adventure and put it to film for what I believe is the first time.  Even with an all-star cast, they manage to bungle the trip much as Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund) bungles his life.  Dean whose name is a substitute for the real life Neal Cassady is an ex-con, drugged out, alcoholic womanizer.  Sal Paradise (Sam Riley), subbing for Kerouac is a depressed writer whose father has just died.

After meeting Dean in New York in 1947, Sal is immediately smitten by Dean's carefree attitude about life.  Dean returns to his hometown in Denver and invites Sal to visit.  Sal decides to do it, but with no money, no job, not much of a life he decides to hitchhike, taking odd jobs along the way.  When he eventually shows up, Dean has married girlfriend Marylou aka LuAnne Henderson played by Kristen Stewart.  Marylou is about as carefree as Dean and meets Sal while lounging mostly naked on the bed.  She is constantly flirting with whoever is around and Dean seems OK with it, even to the point of her being the trois to the boy's mnage.

Several characters come in and out of the trio's life including Carlo Marx/Allen Ginsberg (Tom Sturridge) who clearly has a romantic thing for Dean.  The problem with the film is that there is no cohesion or structure to the story.  Perhaps it was meant to be that way.  I've not read Kerouac's book so I can't comment on any common ground.  The film and the characters move around from New York to Denver to San Francisco to Maryland, back to New York then to New Orleans.  Everywhere they go, new characters appear, including those portrayed by Terrence Howard, Amy Adams, Alice Braga, Elisabeth Moss, Kirsten Dunst, Viggo Mortensen and others.  I was watching this with my son and he told me that the only reason he was sticking around is to see which famous actor will appear next for their few minutes on film.

In one farcical scene, Sal and Dean are hitchhiking and are picked up by a credited ""Tall Thin Salesman"" played by Steve Buscemi.  ""Tall"" shows up at the guy's room with a bottle of whiskey and looking for action but not with a lady.  Sal's a bit disgusted, but Dean does the deed earning $20 for his trick.  Eventually, Sal has enough material to write his book and Dean looks like he's headed for an early grave.

The performances are fine by all concerned.  The movie might be worth a look just to see Ms. Stewart give a strong performance after all those vampire movies.  She's good and you'll see her in a way you haven't before.  I can't recommend it otherwise.  It's just a mess.

The Blu ray transfer is excellent however.  Salles was working again with Eric Gautier who he used with ""The Motorcycle Diaries.""  The film was shot on 35mm so you will see some grain in the transfer.  I loved the winter scenes and all of the cars from the late '40's and early '50's look great.  The 1080p resolution looks terrific in the wide 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is even better.  The film has an excellent musical soundtrack with plenty of jazz throughout thanks to composer Gustavo Santaolalla.  The surrounds are in play constantly.  Check out the scene where the guys go to see Slim Gaillard played by Coati Mundi. He performs the jive ""Yip Roc Heresy."" Extras are virtually non-existent with some deleted scenes but I had already had enough at just over 2 hours.  There is also a trailer.

Therefore, I didn't expect much from the movie. Since I went into watching this movie with low expectations, I ended up enjoying it to the point where I'm thinking about buying it. But, I ask all those younger folks out there to take the time and read the book first, so you can truly understand the movie. It is great to see an in-color depiction of what the late 40's looked like in various places across the country including nyc, Nebraska, Denver, and Mexico. Although the movie kept its authenticity with the 1940's model cars and buses, some parts of the road trip looked more like a painting than reality. No part of the movie dragged, but it was a little hard to understand what the characters were saying at times when speaking softly....kind of muffled and confusing.

There is a lot of graphic nudity in this movie, so don't watch this when children are around. I am glad they showed so much because it made the story that much more close to how the book was written. When I watched this movie, it was exactly what I pictured in my mind when reading the book. I just wish it wasn't produced by such a low budget film company.

In a nutshell, the movie is based on post WW2 when the country was confused, broke, and slowly trying to recover to a normal lifestyle, however you define ""normal"". A poor, depressed group of guys who found a bond (especially Sal and Dean) seek thrills and adventure through traveling across country and experience sexual orgies, drugs, nightlife, and maybe a little more about themselves while working odd jobs here and there for traveling money.

Kristen's acting was excellent. I wish the movie had shown more of her in-the-raw goodies. I usually watch a new movie from Amazon twice in two successive evenings. Most movies I watch five or more times. This movie I will watch only this one time. A good part was Kristen's acting. The rest was BORING!!!
The only good part was the closing credits which showed the author charter walking down a lonely railroad line somewhere in Arizona. I worked for the Southern Pacific for twenty-five years on the tracks. I know of no lonelier place than the tracks across New Mexico, Arizona and California.

The main problem with the movie is that it was promoted far too much with far to high expectations, and with far too many shots of Kristen. The promotional ads showed much Kristen, but she was only a side character. This movie should have been on Showtime or HBO.

Just to give a little background on my mindset before I viewed this movie, I am not a Kerouac fan.  Reading Kerouac as a black woman, is like repeatedly sticking a fork in my eye in some parts.  It's painful to read the misogyny and the romanticism of picking cotton (When I read he thought he could make it his ""life's work,"" I almost threw the book out of the window).  But, I continued and actually understood his mindset by the end of the book.  However, I really never wanted to be in his head again.  It was a scary place.

So, as you could probably tell, I had my reservations about the movie.  However, the cast won me over.  When you have Amy Adams, Viggo Mortensen, Steve Buscemi, Kristen Stewart, Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley, and Kirsten Dunst all in one movie, you can practically guarantee some fine performances and I wasn't disappointed at all.  In fact, I'm a huge Kristen Stewart fan, in particular, and she blew me away, per usual.

On the Road is a story about a search for meaning in life - the ""It.""  These young people were driven by their personal searches for God, their fathers (and in some ways their mothers), and a place to call home.  They found all of those things in each other.  Particularly, Sal Paradise (Jack Kerouac) found those things in Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) and vice versa.  They hurt people along the way and made horrible life choices.  But, they lived put loud and inspired others to do the same.  This movie did an amazing job of showing the joy and pain in this journey that Sal took.

So, if you like road movies about self-discovery and you want to see America roll in front of your eyes in all of its beauty and harshness, then you will enjoy this movie.  It's not the book.  It's its own thing.  One thing I wish Walter Salles, the director, and the screen writer, Jose Rivera, would've done differently is show how interconnected Sal/Jack started to feel with the world.  He started to see his friends in people of all different races and backgrounds.  He started to see himself in everyone.  ""Life is the road and all roads lead to the world.""  He became a world citizen because of his travels and I think that would've been important to emphasize somehow.  It's the same thing that Malcom X discovered before he was killed and Martin Luther King, Jr, knew before he was murdered.  I'm not comparing Jack Kerouac to these men.  I'm just saying that they all became global thinkers.",1371340800,50,2593,4.5042918454935625

It tells the story of Sal and his new friend Dean, who set out `on the road' to find themselves, resisting conformity in order to really understand their identity.  It's a journey involving drugs, alcohol and plenty of jazz, not to mention sex.. but ultimately for all the effective and beautiful cinematography and set design (what beautiful roads they are on..), and admittedly wonderful performances from Garret Hedlund in particular, this doesn't really go anywhere or tell us enough about either the times, the characters or the finding of the identity that is so central to the idea of the story, although there are intriguing moments along the way.
In converting the novel to the screen, Salles has apparently relied heavily on the original prose particularly in the use of voice overs, without really coming up with a cinematic hook for how to tell this story to a modern audience.  If you decide to adapt a much loved novel, it stands to reason that you have a compelling vision for how it translates into a piece of cinema.  If it's just a love of the novel and a desire to bring it to the big screen - then this is what you end up with, a mumbling stream of eloquent but unengaging bohemian characters, aimlessly drifting but trying to learn about life in the process.  It seems to short change the book, given the novel's reputation.  At the very least it's all just a little too restrained and buttoned up to match the beat ethos.
As a story intended to exemplify the values of the `beat generation', the movies success really depends on whose definition you use.  If you go by the critics who insist `beat' refers to beaten down, then this movie does portray that kind of bleakness.. however if you go by Kerouac's version of `beat' meaning beatific or blissful, the movie falls a long, long way short in convincing.  If the message is about promoting a stand against conformism, then it's failed in my opinion, because at no point do you really find yourself empathising with these characters, much less desiring of or appreciative of their values.  Can this really be the novel that inspired lifestyle and artistic choices for Bob Dylan, The Doors, Tom Waits and so many others? Alas no, it's a facsimile of it which, ironically, has lost its way.
