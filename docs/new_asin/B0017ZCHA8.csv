8267934,2,B0017ZCHA8,Excellent video for my 9 year old grand daughter to understand how important it is to have a beginning knowledge of the science of electricity.  Thank you!,1403308800,,155,4.7407407407407405
8267935,3,B0017ZCHA8,"I purchased this for helping me to teach an adult class on basic electricity.  Being a 30 minute video, I did not expect it to go into any great depth on the subject.  I'll agree that the video is fun, entertaining, and interesting, and the viewer cannot help but to learn something too, but I'd have to say that the focus is definitely on the entertainment aspect, as Mr. Krampf spends much more time doing ""cool"" exhibitions/experiment, than he does explaining important basic principals such as: Basic circuits, Ohms law, etc.  Even though Krampf's experiments with Tesla coils might be ""really cool"", they have little practical purpose in the video, other than to amuse/entertain.  In summary, this is a good video for getting kids (and maybe adults) interested in electricity, and therefore curious to learn more, but it falls far short of even touching on many of the most basic aspects of electricity to those who are already motivated to learn.",1392336000,,952,4.894409937888199
8267936,5,B0017ZCHA8,"My fourth grade class loved this! Just thirty minutes long and full of interesting facts and experiments, it was a great supplement for our electricity unit in science.",1354752000,,168,5.035714285714286
8267937,5,B0017ZCHA8,R. Krampf was entertaining and factual. I used this video as a review for finals - another way to cover materials. I was so impressed that I plan to subscribe to his web site this summer so I can access other videos and information during the school year. Worth every penny!,1338768000,,274,4.392156862745098
8267938,5,B0017ZCHA8,"This DVD has some very dramatic and interesting demonstrations of electricity in it's many forms - and it's backed up by a clear explanation. Anyone, kids and adults alike, will find this entertaining. Plus, you will learn things you might not have know that could save you a mighty shock.

This DVD comes with a few cool extras. 1) an interactive on-screen quiz you can take to see what you know about electricity. 2) Place the disk in your computer and there are printable experiments that can be done in the home or the classroom. Great for teachers. 3) Four extra experiment videos from Robert Krampf's video experiment series.

A great value and very fun to watch. You will learn something.",1212192000,8,695,4.735537190082645
