3411335,3,B00181XY6M,"I think it's important to mention that Constantine was NOT a Christian.  He was actually a pagan and remained one all of his life.  It was only on his deathbed that he converted to Christianity or should I say denounced Paganism.  I believe he was a tool used in order to candy coat paganism with Christianity and then force it down everyones throat. Let's not forget The Roman Empire were comprised predominantly of Pagans. He is the one who mandated Worshipping on Sunday (Pagan Sabbath) instead of the true Sabbath (Saturday), along with many other Pagan rituals, followed up to the present time.  I think this was the plan all along.  They could not cull the Christians and so had to find another way to control them.  It isn't Religions per say trying to control the masses it's a goal of Paganism trying to control the masses and pawn it off on the Christians.  You've got to admit they are very clever.  People who believe they are practicing Christianity are really practicing Paganism and have absolutely no clue. If you celebrate Easter(Ishtar) or Christmas(birth of The Sun God, Saturnalia) you are not a practicing Christian.  Please folks pick up a book.",1220486400,2,1167,4.766169154228856

3411346,3,B00181XY6M,The writer should focus more on the ramifications of Constantine's actions and less on his own conspiracy theories -- wildly covering 1700 years. John Carroll has done his homework on the early history of Constantine and the immediate period following his era but appears to be following more current tracks that lead to conspirators that better fit his pre-conceived ideas. The film is repetitive especially on those issues that support his extreme agenda. I was disappointed with his anti-war agenda and his willingness to consistently indict the U.S. military for every action after WWII. Silly stuff.,1398211200,,604,5.302083333333333
3411347,2,B00181XY6M,"I gave Constantines Sword two stars because there is some good in this documentary. James Carroll expresses a deep empathy with those who have endured the pain of persecution. And he has exposed much evil that purported Christians have done. Otherwise I would have given it only one star because I see his views as so extremely misguided. As his extreme view of tolerance becomes increasingly accepted, no one will have the liberty to express their views (unless they are the right views) and the most innocuous criticism or advocacy will be seen as hate-speech.

When friends seek to persuade each other concerning their particular political views, we are usually happy to think that freedom of speech is in some small way producing a better society. Whenever one person believes they have discovered something to be true and seeks to persuade someone else, we normally think of this as a way to come closer to the truth. Yet when Christians seek to persuade people (including Jews) of their religion, Carroll calls it proselytism and possibly even anti-semitic.

If we had a movie about Jeremiah (or Moses or any other of the ancient Hebrew prophets) denouncing the Jewish people and rulers for their sins, and those rulers/people seeking to kill the prophetmaybe even saying, Let his blood be upon uswould this be taken as anti-semitic? Obviously not. Yet when Jesus (a Jew) did the same thing and the Jewish rulers sought to kill him (according to the gospels and Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ), Carroll says it is. One non-Christian Jew who saw Gibsons movie complained of seeing Jews portrayed as hateful and ugly. My impression was that there were more Gentiles portrayed this way (e.g., the Roman soldiers), and many Jews (those who didn't want to kill Jesus) were portrayed as good.

Carroll almost seems to see anti-semitism everywhere. The gospels tell of Roman soldiers gambling for Jesus robe when he died. He claims that this is anti-semitic and then says that scholars have shown this story to be apocryphal. Yet no good reason is given (or can be given) to think this story is either made up or that it could conceivably induce anti-semitism.

He claims that the early Christian zeal to convert others began with good intentions but then it went too far. If Christians believe that one can find new life and acceptance by God through Jesus, then whether it is true or not, they would be obligated to share this message. Whether or not in any particular location more of this evangelization is occurring than normally occurs, this is what Christians should be doing. Yet when a Yale Divinity School team investigated the Air Force Academy, they reported widespread evangelizing as if this were reprehensible. Certainly neither Christians not anyone else should badger others to accept their particular views, but neither should anyones freedom of speech be limited.

Another troubling aspect of this video was the conflation of very different attitudes and beliefs with anti-semitism. Outright secular anti-semitism was evident at the Air Force Academy (one person called another a f Jew) as well as mere Christian evangelism. There is nothing anti-semitic about Christian evangelism and nothing Christian about secular anti-semitism.

The church, like any other institution, can and often has become a source of political power. It will then attract evil people and corrupt good people. Like any other politicized institution, it can be the source of great evil as well as good and no one should then be surprised when they see both good and evil in the history of the church. We should expect crusades and pogroms and inquisitions when leaders disregard the ethical teachings of the religions founder and seek to defend and advance the church at any cost. But we should also expect the social reform that Christianity has so often initiated. From the abolition of slavery, to the halting of social disintegration (e.g., the 19th century Irish in America), to self-sacrifical care for the lowest classes of society.

One other failing in this documentary is its iteration of the evils of the church with insufficient mention of its achievements. As I said, we should expect to see in the church a mixture of good and evil. Some good was mentioned, such as one Popes giving asylum to the expelled Spanish Jews, but far less than one would expect from a fair historical assessment. For example, Carroll discusses the Nazi deportation of Jews living near the Vatican but fails to mention the Popes hiding more than half of the Jews remaining in Rome, his providing fifteen kilos of gold as the balance of the ransom the Nazis demanded to protect the Roman Jews in 39, or his protest through his representatives that halted (or helped to halt) the 1943 roundup (see Carroll & Shiflett, Christianity on Trial, ch. 5).

The church, whether Protestant, Catholic, or Eastern, is made up of people. Sometimes they are very evil people, sometimes very stupid people, but sometimes they are also very conflicted people. For example, had Pius excommunicated Hitler or otherwise criticized him too openly, he feared greater reprisals for priests and other Catholics in countries under Hitlers power. It is easy to criticize Pius or others when we are not in his shoes facing the ethical quagmire he faced. Nevertheless, if some of Carrolls criticisms are true, Pius was clearly not guiltless.

No religious institution (Christian or any other religion) should be free of the states oversight for abuse of power. And yet no state should have the power to dictate to any religion what it should believe or say unless it is undeniably evil. For example, Catholic beliefs opposing abortion or homosexual behavior should not be politically sanctioned while the beliefs and practices of the Thugs of India (killing people in the name of Kali) definitely should have been outlawed.",1397520000,,5885,5.003064351378958

3411350,2,B00181XY6M,"I understand perfectly Caroll thinking his father's alienation being caused by military and religion.  My father advised Congress on key military technologies.  I too blamed (and still blame!) my father's dedication to the defense infrastructure for his inattention to me, and I too associated the defense industry's demands of my father to his Catholicism and so I too blamed religion.  Coincidentally, I was a seminarian in high school.  But for all that Caroll and I share, I am not nearly as sure as Caroll.  In fact, I am forced to reconsider my own version of the truth because I know Caroll's is not perfect or sure.  To be sure the documentary is flawed and twists the facts the more I research.

Cross as sword(Constantine's sword):
Here the film simply fails to launch.  Caroll gives the impression the cross symbol only came into being after Constantine.  The sign of the cross is documented(in the second century AD) well before Constantine's rule, so even the film's title and its implied assertion is false.

Edith Stein:
The Catholic News Service corrects this and other Caroll transgressions of the actual history:
""...he fails to mention that such converts were rounded up in retaliation for the Dutch Catholic bishops' public denunciation of Nazi racism. That sequence of events may have influenced Pope Pius XII's decision to avoid a similarly explicit public declaration, a policy Carroll excoriates repeatedly.""

AF Academy:
The Air Force Academy situation seems overblown.  The only example of institutionalized religion there was the Passion of the Christ ads given out at one meal.  That's it, ONE documented incident.  While the documentary harps on this, apparently there were no other incidentsm and the details remain unclear.  The accusation of being called [an ethnic name that was curiously edited by Amazon] by the one former Jewish cadet, whose father was suing the Air Force Academy, seemed a bit bizarre, without context, and without any corroboration.  My brother went to the AF Academy in the 80s, and never experienced anything that the film suggests.  If there was an attempted infiltration, who cares?...just stop it and move on, it's clear it isn't endemic as the film suggests, and no other military campuses have had complaints.

Pope and Islam:
'Pope Benedict associating Islam with ""things only evil and inhuman""' is a mischaracterization of yet another overblown event.  It was actually Benedict addressing university students regarding a quote from a Byzantine Emperor six centuries ago to an Islamic scholar, as that Emperor's city was under siege by Muslims: ""Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.""  ONE quote by a leader clearly under stress of being invaded - not the institutional declaration the film poses that quote as, and definitely not attributed to Benedict.

3411353,3,B00181XY6M,"""It's a very dangerous thing when military might and religious ferver comes together."" Director Oren Jacoby

I was an anti-war activist during the Vietnam era. As James Carroll showed pictures of himself engaged in that struggle as a young Catholic priest, I had the uncanny impression I met him at some point in those days. Not too far-fetched, as there were a lot of Catholic priests and nuns actively protesting. And neither he nor I knew then that he would become famous as a writer and I would not. LOL

I think this movie is about different things for different people. Part of that is the way it was created. The book from which it was adapted is almost entirely about the Catholic church's treatment of the Jews throughout its history. Mostly, it's been pretty lousy. But either after the book was written or while he was writing it, James Carroll became aware of just how deeply the evangelical Christians are embedded in the Air Force Academy.

Carroll's father was a high-ranking officer in the Air Force, heading up the military counter-intelligence unit and reporting to President Kennedy about the evidence of missiles being installed in Cuba. Indeed, it is my impression that Carroll's father was the one who first identified the evidence from aerial photography or satellite pictures, I'm not sure which. He goes into a good bit of detail about his father's involvement with the Air Force Academy in the film. I guess it is going to mean I have to read the book to separate all that out.

Anyway, the beginning and the end of the film are both involved with the extent to which the war in Iraq is being treated as a holy war by the military, and the extent of the Christian proselytizing that goes on in the Academy. For example, fliers about Mel Gibson's ""Passion of Christ"" were on every plate in the mess hall MORE THAN ONCE, and a large banner was shown that said this was an Air Force event, and don't take down the banner.

A significant part of the film consists of interviews with a large number of people. One of particular significance is Mikey Weinstein, founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation. After his son Casey and his daughter-in-law, both cadets at the Air Force Academy, told him about the virulent anti-Semites on the campus, and the extent to which evangelical Christians dominated the academy, he started investigating. When he opened a web site for the MRFF, he invited people who had experienced religious discrimination in the military to contact him. He has now gotten something like 7,500 reports.

He has also filed suit on behalf of his son and daughter-in-law, who are Jews, and a Cadet Hall, who is an atheist. The film goes into a good bit of detail about the evidence for that discrimination.

Let's make it clear here that we are not talking about denying Christians their right to pray, attend worship services, or anything like that. But as one general put it, sometimes they don't understand where the limits of freedom of expressions of faith are. And it seems that some pretty high-ranking officers don't understand, either.",1336953600,,3092,4.7790262172284645
3411354,4,B00181XY6M,"As others have noted, this is from James Carroll's book of the same name. It deals with how the Catholic Church was responsible for, or complicit in, the persecution of Jews throughout history. And how the practice is still prevalent today, though no longer sanctioned by the church.

It starts by noting that a very large Evangelical church in Colorado Springs is actively trying to bring recruits from the nearby Air Force Academy into the fold, and how that has given rise to antisemitism in the academy.

Carroll is no slouch. He is a one time Catholic priest who had been involved in the peace movement during the Viet Nam war and whose father was very high up in the military. He himself had a great love for the military and very nearly applied to the Air Force Academy. He has a foot in both worlds and knows of what he speaks. He's done a huge amount of research in the area and visited, first hand, many of the places where these events had taken place. He also spoke with a few of the survivors of the more recent tragedies so the viewer has little doubt as to the veracity of the occurrences. This is just all very sad on how the church had their hand in the near extermination of a race of people. And how, even though they are now trying to reverse things, others under the Christian banner continue this despicable behavior.

Seeing the reverend from the church interviewed gave me a creepy feeling. Outside of the fact that his logic was entirely skewed, something in his demeanor made my skin crawl. That the authorities did, in fact, uncover a conspiracy vindicates Carroll. That other governmental entities didn't want to fess up, and tried to turn the tables on the accusers, is disturbing. That the reverend had a dark side, and had to step down, put the capper on it for me.

This could have used a bit more focus. Given the way it started, and the various paths it took made me see it as a bit disjointed. But it's still a powerful statement with a lot of indisputable evidence at it's core. This is a very good watch.",1335744000,,2041,4.463806970509383
3411355,4,B00181XY6M,"The documentary ""Constantine's Sword,"" directed by Oren Jacoby, grapples with the age-old question of why, throughout the course of human history, so much bloodshed and violence have been committed in the name of God.

In this case, the person making the inquiry is James Carroll, a former priest turned author who wrote the book on which the film is based.  Raised a devout Roman Catholic, Carroll came to question aspects of his religion during the height of the anti-war movement of the 1960s - a movement which the Church officially condemned - and when he began to research the role the Church itself had played in fostering and implementing anti-Semitic violence in the almost two thousand years of its existence (he doesn't go much into the Catholic-on-Protestant/Protestant-on-Catholic violence occurring at the same time).  He cites the conversion of Constantine as the moment when Christianity turned into a violent religion and notes how the portrayal of the Jews as ""Christ-killers"" set in motion centuries of Church-sanctioned and Church-fueled anti-Semitism.  He points to the crusades of the early 1000s, the widespread persecution and extermination of Jews during the Middle Ages, and even the far more recent cozy relationship between the Vatican and the fascist dictators of the 1930s and `40s - and the Church's lack of effort in halting the Holocaust - as evidence of his thesis.

Interestingly, Carroll focuses almost exclusively on acts of violence perpetrated by Christians on Jews and Muslims and ignores acts of violence perpetrated by those groups against others (i.e., the Hebrew genocide of the Canaanites found in the Book of Joshua, modern-day Islamic jihadist attacks on Israel and the West).  Perhaps, due to his papist background, Carroll simply feels more personal responsibility for Catholic-approved atrocities and doesn't feel comfortable examining the other side of the religious-violence coin.  However, even if that is indeed the case, it still results in a strangely unbalanced look at the subject.  Then again, since when is it the job of every documentary to cover every single aspect of the subject it's documenting?  Plus, he does make the case that, until Christianity owns up to its violent history, conflicts with other religions will only intensify in the years to come.

Currently, one place in which Carroll sees religion and military power coming together is in the United States Air Force, where officers and cadets - including Jews, Muslims and nonbelievers - are being coerced into becoming Evangelical Christians.  He travels to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs to document that situation.  Carroll feels that a military defined by this kind of sectarian religious zeal will only further convince the other side that we are indeed engaged in some kind of modern-day holy war with Islam, a Twenty-first Century crusade.  At great personal risk to themselves, a group of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the Air Force for the right not to be proselytized to - an act for which they've received condemnation from the powers-that-be and even death threats.  This, in many ways, is the most disturbing and eye-opening section of the movie - not least of all because an obviously pre-scandal Ted Haggard gets quite a bit of air-time commenting on the subject, since it was he who filed a counter-lawsuit on the part of evangelicals to be allowed to continue preaching the evangelical gospel to a captive audience of military personnel.

Carroll ends his film with the four sobering words, ""No war is holy"" - and with a title card revealing Haggard's eventual fall from grace for consorting with a male prostitute and snorting crack.  I guess sometimes the good guys do win after all.",1326240000,,3744,5.153465346534653

3411358,4,B00181XY6M,"This documentary follows Carrol's noteworthy book of the same name which studies and documents Catholic & Christian causes of anti-semitism.  He also portrays his conflict with his father over his critisizm of the Catholic church and the military particularly in the war in Vietnam.  Carrol, a catholic priest from 1969 until 1974 gave up the collar to pursue scholarly and journalistic works often critical of the catholic church.  Like his book Carrol details the church history giving rise to horrible persecution of the Jews culminating in the Holocaust which he says would not have happened but for the failure of the Catholic church to object.  He retreads the rise of Constantine when anti-semitism was born in the 4th century, covers the crusades which resulted in much anti-Jewish as well as anti-muslim violence, the Spanish Inquisition which killed or drove out all the Jews of Spain and Portugal, the multiple anti-Jewish pogroms, and culminates in the Holocaust, the greatest crime of the 20th century. I agree that without the tacit approval of the Pope and Catholic clergy the holocaust could not have happened.  The church bears tremendous responsibility for the crime.  The Vatican II encylical went part way toward healing the rift between Cathlics and Jews but did not go far enough.  Had Pope John remained Pope perhaps there would have been more movement in that direction.  However, the new German Pope is not likely to admit the fallibility of the church and instead has tread a bit backward soft peddling the churches' failure during this time.  Additionally, Carrol sounds the alarm for the danger of the evangelical incursion into our military academies and in particular the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.  Christian evangelical meetings and movies like The Passion of The Christ by Mel Gibson are promoted with the imprimiteur of Air Force Academy sanction.  Jewish, Muslim and non-Christian cadets are made to feel bad and ""other.""  Again Jews are protrayed as the enemy and alum Mickey Weinstien and his sons attending the academy have complained loudly.  However, it is not loud enough for the academy to stop allowing evangelicals to insinuate themselves into the program.  This is probably because the Generals who run the place are probably participating in these churches.  Sadly, New Life mega church previously run by Ted Haggard made great inroads.  Ted Haggart had President Geroge W Bush on speed dial which should tell you a lot about Bush.  He has since been defrocked after his 3 year relationship with a male lover came to light.  It is just another story about a gay man in the closet and in this case it was the closet of evangelical christianity.  Since then another Colorado Springs mega church has taken over the conversion of the cadets to ""born again Christians"".  This turn of events is alarming and a great danger to our seperation of church and state.  Let us hope that this bell does not go unnoticed.  No promotions or announcements of any religious activity should be allowed to appear except on specified bulletin boards.  There should be no flyers on plates at meals etc.  This is appalling.  Also appalling is that any chaplain who has critisized such promotion of religion among the cadets has been taken down, had promotions forestalled and wings clipped.  These are the chaplains that should be promoted and heeded, but they are not.  So after watching the film, write to your legislators. Tell them to oppose allowing religions to promote themselves at our military academies.  Require such institutions to post announcements on stationary bulletin boards in one or two common areas.  Carrol clearly loves the Catholic church and his faith.  However, he wants to improve it by seeking it admissions of wrong doing in history.  It is like an adoring child who learns that his parent is not perfect.  He has not thrown out his faith.  He is a staunch cathoic still.",1304812800,2,3935,5.004615384615384

Nor did it spend much time on Constantine either (5 minutes tops).

Movie was mostly a yawner - no surprises, the same old poorly constructed, loose connections, and poor science (looking for information that supports your theory, while discarding everything else). While not falling asleep I was actually laughing - though there were a few nice jabs at the evangelists that made it watchable, and great footage of the Jewish ghetto-turned-prime-real estate in Rome. The most amusing part was the ""biblical scholar"" stating Jesus couldn't have been crucified. The Romans crucified virtually anything that wasn't already nailed down to something else. He should've discussed the history of Roman Sacrifice - but that would've derailed his argument. Instead he painted the Romans as peaceful law-abiding citizens, amicably co-existing with equal populations of Jews and Christians until Constantine, and not as the blood hungry fascists history shows us to have persecuted both Jews and Christians relentlessly. I was rolling on the floor at this point. The only reason Christians outnumbered the Jews after his proclamation of Christianity being the official state religion, is all those Roman Fascists converted to Christianity on the spot, rather than ending up on that cross themselves. That part of the movie was ironic satire at its worst.

But back to the brunt of the movie's allegations: there is no question that the pope could have done more to save Jews - albeit there was a massacre of Catholics taking place, and official rebellion might have made it worse (but aren't the truly religious supposed to martyr themselves) - but what about the US Government (who ignored every report of it, doing nothing at all - not even entering the war until Pearl Harbor), IBM (who made money selling the Nazis card punch readers to make the death camps more efficient), and the German people themselves, who say they just did their jobs as law-abiding German citizens. As long as we're spreading blame... how come the movie left all of this out? Can you say AGENDA? Had the US Government acted, it would have emboldened many more people to stand up to the Nazis (and ironically virtually all that did oppose were themselves Catholic). Had the German people refused... well, history would be quite different today. But he lays all the blame on the Gospel of John and the Catholic Church.

I was surprised he didn't just come out of the closet and grind his axe over what he's really upset about - the banning of Gays from the Catholic Priesthood. Why didn't he just interview Elton John, and go forward on the assumption that Jesus was a persecuted Gay male, and Christianity/Catholicism is anti-Semitic because of its own homophobia? Hey, but that would have made me up this rating to at least two stars for getting closer to the real point, since this was about the author, and not about Constantine at all. And that's the brunt of my disappointment; this film had nothing to do with Constantine, and everything to do with James Carroll and his own ideologues.

The title, Constantine's Sword, refers to the Christian Cross of which Emperor Constantine allegedly was told by Jesus: ""With this sign conquer"".

The film, directed by Oren Jacoby, examines the anti-semitic Christian legacy - - ""a lake of gasoline needing only a match to ignite"" - - which has been passed from generation to generation beginning with Emperor Constantine, 1700 years ago. The film documents the efforts of recent popes and other Christian religious leaders to distance their sects from the pogroms they helped initiate. Carroll is particularly upset by the dishonest revisionism of the Vatican as to Pope Pius XII's collaboration with the Nazis and his participation in the Shoah.

The viewer is escorted on a visit to the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs where evangelical christian officers intimidate recruits with the necessity of their becoming evangelical Christians.

3411366,1,B00181XY6M,"Saw this in the free dvd rental section at my local library & looked interesting-I love good documentaries.  Constantine is a seminal figure in history...maybe I was expecting a serious theological look at the roots of pacificism...maybe interview some Mennonite/Amish types or have some articulate NT scholar go over Jesus' refusal to pick up the sword & accept the crucifixion instead.

Wrong!  A few minutes in, this turns into a wacky piece of Jewish propaganda...as if they're the only ones in history to have had it rough.  More insulting is the slight of hand used in playing the victim role to the hilt.  From what this doc shows (Dustin Hoffman's gig as Lenny...some college kid at the AF Academy wierded out by his roommates fundamentalist Christianity etc.) , they seem to think every Jew ever killed is in retaliation to them assisting the Romans w/Jesus' death. Whatever.  If anything, a basic understanding of the concept of Paschal Mystery means Christians should probably thank the Jews for setting salvation in motion by handing Jesus over.  It's called ""Good Friday"" after all...there would be no glory of the resurrection at Easter w/out it.

Pretty much every war waged from biblical times onward has been economic in nature and not for theological reasons.  If people actually cared about religion that much...but when push comes to shove, the bottom line is always green.  It's a tribute to the artists of spin to get one to believe otherwise.

Usury was a sin (in Catholicism) up until about a hundred years ago that forbade Christians from participating in banking...when you have masses of hungry people in Germany getting exploited by their Jewish bankers, it's no wonder why what happened, did.  There were some nasty, dirty, evil things done to the working classes in Germany for decades leading up to the Holocaust.  It's funny how movies about the holocaust always skirt this issue.  Not to justify what happened...but at least begin to understand why it did.  But that's not even the main cause behind WW II. Hitler went after handicapped, gays etc. More Russians died. He violated boundaries w/a plethora of (Christian) cultures/nations. It's not because Hitler had nominal Christian ties that he went after Jews. It's because he was a sociopath.

James Carroll comes off as a 60's leftover who's been victimized by his dad's militant patriotism in his childhood.  Carroll's foray into the priesthood seemed to fail after five years.  Since then seems he's become a toolbag for the Jewish ""intellectual elite""...if they could only find a sharper tool in the shed.

To call Pius ""Hitler's Cardinal"" is hindsight 20/20.  He was dealing w/any other head of state (democraticaly elected.) Maybe we should call H.S. Truman ""Hitler's President"" after all, he could have reacted sooner.

Call me an ""anti-Semite"" but there's no shortage of Jewish names listed in the credits & in the rave-ups on the DVD cover. Coincidence?  A lotta grant money gave cast & crew some great location shots.

Which begs the question of how hypocritical all of this is w/how Israel deals w/the ""Palestinian problem.""  To borrow an unbiased sentence from Carroll's mouth ""the Jews were thriving...then placed in ghettos.""  Kinda sounds similar to the Arab's prior to 1947.  I've been over there, I know. Truth hurts sometimes, don't it?

So if James C. is really a big fan of Jesus as ""Prince of Peace"" shouldn't he oppose the tens of millions of dollars American taxpayers send over every day to fund the Israeli military machine. He claims to be against hypocracy but can't see it in himself (or especially the manipulative producers of this propaganda.) Oddly enough, it's the Fundagelicals who are pro-Israel...and then the Jews who get offended when they spout their conversion attempts.  Strange bedfellows.

Only watch this if you want to become really angry at a sneaky attempt to manipulate your better judgement w/one assinine edict after another.  Carroll's a dinosaur...and all these goofy ideas from his generation in the academy hopefully will soon become extinct.",1276732800,8,4082,5.067365269461078
3411367,5,B00181XY6M,"It's a testimony to James Carroll's brilliance that in the course of a 90-minute documentary he manages to weave together three distinct themes, showing how the personal and the political are related, and how the stories we tell can change everything - including our most fundamental beliefs.

The documentary's first thread is personal. Carroll's father was an important general during the Cold War. Vietnam divided father and son. Carroll wrote about this in ""An American Requiem: God, My Father, and the War That Came Between Us,"" which won a 1996 National Book Award. Carroll became a priest rather than following his father into the Air Force. The key moment of this story is Carroll's first Mass, on a military base, his father in attendance. The young Carroll preached from Ezekiel of the Old Testament, who wrote about bones from the slaughter of war, burned by the sun... and napalm, Carroll added. His father never forgave him, he says.

The second thread, public but also personal for Carroll, now an ex-priest, is the shadow cast by the cross - a symbol for Christianity only since the fourth century, when Roman Emperor Constantine conquered in its sign. Carroll wrote an award-winning book about this as well - the 2001 ""Constantine's Sword, The Church and the Jews - A History."" Whereas before Constantine Christianity's symbols referenced life, the cross is all about the tortured death of God, caused by... the Jews. Carroll interviews Elaine Pagels, who speaks to the unlikelihood of that actually being the truth - but (for historical reasons not covered in this film, i.e., the early Church's need to separate itself from the Jews, and, by the turn of the second century, the deep discouragement over not being successful in converting the Jews) that's the story that made it into the Gospels. The film covers 1700 years of anti-Semitism in European history by means of a few well chosen clips and events, ending, of course, with the Holocaust and Edith Stein, the Jewish philosopher who became a Carmelite nun and died in a concentration camp.

The third thread is public, the danger of religion insinuating itself into government power, corrupting both, as happened in Europe during those centuries, and which seemed to be happening during the W years. Perhaps it still is happening. Carroll went to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs to tell the story of the evangelical proselytizing taking place there. He interviews Academy graduate Mikey Weinstein and Weinstein's son, a cadet who had been subjected to aggressive proselytizing. Ted Haggard, with a maniacal, rictus grin, explains to Carroll that such behavior is part of the beauty of America, not a problem, and that the Weinsteins really want religion out of the Academy altogether. ""We are not an atheistic society,"" Haggard proclaims. As if that means our government should be in bed with the evangelicals.

It's a brilliant, thought-provoking film, and especially troubling in its epilogue, showing that we don't seem to be learning from these past lessons that seem so obvious. It's also inspiring in that Carroll, despite it all, speaks so clearly about his Christian (not Christianist) faith.",1264982400,17,3185,5.084130019120459

These include family / personal issues, history of church violence, anti-Semitism, Viet Nam, and the infiltration of Christian fundamentalism into the Air Force Academy.

As a documentary the film is all over the map, selective and limited in it's documentation, subjective in it's conclusions. The result is a flawed film that I would not be able to recommend.

I hope Mr. Carroll is able to make peace with himself and with his God. I think that's really what this film is about.",1237334400,4,791,4.751824817518248
3411373,1,B00181XY6M,"A few years ago, ex-priest James Carroll wrote a fatuous and flatulent book called ""Constantine's Sword"", which purported to be a history of the Catholic Church's crimes against the Jews, arguing that the Gospel's natural fruits are anti-semitism and violence and that Christianity directly led to the Holocaust. Carroll's book was praised by atheists, dissident Catholics and professional Semites, while being mocked as feeble-minded drivel by serious scholars. This self-indulgent and incoherent documentary is Carroll's attempt to squeeze a little more notoriety and a few more bucks out of a very bad book.

Since Vatican II's Nostra Aetate diluted the Catholic Church's Gospel message in the 1960s, in his search for Christian ""anti-Semitism"" Carroll was forced to find his villain in the protean and rather ridiculous specter of American Evangelicalism. We travel to the U.S. Air Force Academy where we discover that there is an improper relationship between the administration and Colorado Springs' myriad evangelical sects, and that some Jewish cadets are subject to proselytization by other cadets. Could a more innocuous threat possibly be imagined than slavishly philo-Semitic American evangelicalism? After all, what horrible ordeals did the Jewish students have to endure? Well, they once received an official advertisement for a campus showing of Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"", and some evangelical cadets frequently try to convert them. Wow. No, it wasn't right for the administration to favor any one particular creed, but there's a big difference between being inappropriate and being anti-Semitic. No one even claims that their academic standing was effected one iota because of their religion. As for the conversion attempts, the Jewish students should familiarize themselves with life as adults in a marketplace of ideas. Yet Mr. Carroll seems to think that pogroms will soon be the order of the day at the Academy.

Perhaps realizing that his entire premise is baseless, Carroll spends the rest of the video droning on about his pathetic personal history. I'm not sure if he is descended from the eminent Carrolls of Carrollton, but he came from a strong and pious Catholic family, the son of prominent Air Force General Joseph Carroll. Carroll fils details his childhood growing up a military brat in occupied Germany, and retrospectively ridicules his family's Catholic devotional activities. He relates how he decided to become a priest during the Cuban Missile Crisis because, tellingly, he was drawn ""not to the Jesus of miracles but the Prince of Peace who hates war"". Already we see Carroll veering away from seeing the Gospel as supernatural revelation and more towards valuing it for its potential to effect political change. Carroll's seminary experience obviously changed him. In a revealing statement, he tells us that he was ""shocked to learn"" in his study of history that ""priests sinned"". Now, if that ludicrous statement is actually true, and not just a calculated lie to portray pre-conciliar Catholicism as developmentally arrested, then Mr. Carroll was an idiot man-child who should have been fitted with a cap 'n' bells instead of a clerical collar.  However, as earlier Communist infiltration of the seminaries was beginning to bear fruit in the 60s, the obviously vapid Carroll was a prime candidate for indoctrination and came out as an obedient agent of the Internationale. The degree of Carroll's devotion to his left-wing gospel can be judged by his conduct at his first Mass. In front of his entire family and his father's military colleagues, the arrogant Carroll preached that the bones in Ezekiel's famous vision had been bleached by napalm, and denounced the Vietnam War from the pulpit, humiliating his father and family. All I could think of when I heard that was ""What a littleprick.""

Carroll spent the next 4 years protesting the war and agitating for various leftist causes. He then he left the priesthood, married (a woman, surprisingly), and has made a living mining Catholicism and his childhood for material to fill his boring and worthless books. He continues to tear down the Church, advocating for gay marriage, abortion, euthanasia, Scriptural expurgation and all the rest of the immoral planks on Satan's party platform. This evil old hack is a good representative specimen of the 1960s university generation, who esteem themselves wise because of their vaunted ""education"", which actually consists of nothing more than the ability to parrot the dogmas of leftist ideology. Critical thinking is deprecated by these intellectual myrmidons; having ""orthodox"" sentiments is the ultimate value. Liberal fools like Carroll don't care about truth, but only want to be on the side of the ""angels"" when some histrionic old Jew starts tearing up over a 1000 year old atrocity. And when that happens, people like Carroll instinctively grovel in the dust and seek absolution through self-destruction- whether of Faith, race or nation. A truly objective scholar would examine history in context. Atrocities have been committed both by and against the Jews. We could just as easily turn our anthropological microscope upon the Chosen People and attempt to learn what it is in the Torah or Talmud that has driven its adherents to oppress and exploit Gentiles throughout the ages, such as in early medieval Europe<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Early-Medieval-Jewish-Policy-in-Western-Europe/dp/0816656983/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Early Medieval Jewish Policy in Western Europe</a>&nbsp;or modern Palestine, or even commit genocide against the goyim such as is documented in the Bible or in Judeo-Soviet Russia. But that doesn't exactly fit the ""script"" of modern historiography.

I can't even begin to enumerate everything else that was so infuriating and frustrating about Carroll; his stupidity, his inconsistency, his mendacious history, his bovine mien, his continued subversion of the Catholic Church, his posse of Judaizing priests who are exorcised over Mel Gibson's ""Passion"", et al. The most frustrating thing though is that the media allows him to continue presenting himself as a ""devoted Catholic"" who only wants to make his church a little more sensitive. He's nothing of the sort. He's a full fledged enemy of the Church who is devoted to nothing but its castration, neutralization and eventual destruction. He only refrains from avowing outright atheism because he sees a role for a new Catholic Church, stripped of most supernatural beliefs and tightly controlled by a leftist clergy of his ilk, in bringing on his Novus Ordo Seclorum. Carroll needs to be exposed, excommunicated, shunned and slapped down. Let him fly his true colors outside the body of Christ and be recognized not as the critical Christian he poses as, but for the enemy of God he is.",1236384000,14,6870,5.386976744186047
3411374,2,B00181XY6M,"The complaint of a few Jewish cadets about overly aggressive Christian evangelism at the U.S. Air Force Academy is James Carroll's jumping off point for a rambling and incoherent meditation on Christianity and anti-semitism.  Carroll's father was an FBI agent turned defense intelligence chief and Air Force general.  Carroll's mother was a very devout Catholic, and Carroll became a Catholic preist for about 8 years, roughly corresponding to the duration of the Vietnam War.

Carroll gets some things right, e.g., that Constantine's conversion to Christianity was nominal and political, not what a modern Christian would view as genuine.  He also correctly points out that the Catholic church during the middle ages was an horrific persecutor of the Jews. (He neglects to mention that the medieval papacy was an horrific persecutor of everyone, including residual pagans, wiccans, Muslims, Cathars, Albigenses, Waldenses, Eastern Christians, Wycliff, Huss, Jerome, Lutherans, Calvinists, insufficiently orthodox Roman Catholics, etc., not just Jews, but I guess that would have been off topic.)

Carroll gets other things horribly wrong, including his constant implication that Christianity was somehow responsible for the Nazi holocaust.  Nazism was an anti-Christian neo-pagan ideology, and yet Carroll tries to tar Christianity with the crimes of its enemy.  That is wrong, and wrongheaded.

What any of this has to do with the Air Force Academy remains a mystery.  Balancing the First Amendment imperatives of church/state separation, on the one hand, and free exercise of religion, on the other hand, is often problematic in the context of taxpayer-funded education.  It appears to me that some chaplains at Colorado Springs may have gone too far in the direction of aggressive evangelism.  But Carroll's attempt to associate this case with the holocaust or with medieval papal persecution of the Jews is bizarre, almost to the point of barking lunacy.

The irony is that not only are American evangelicals unlikely to be anti-semites, they are the best friends that Israel has anywhere in the modern world.  The fervent support for Israel among conservative American Christians has been oft noted and cannot reasonably be disputed, yet Carroll never mentions this fact.  Pro-Israel conservative Christians are prominent among the constituency of James Dobson's Colorado-Springs-based ministry, Focus on the Family, which Carroll slanders in passing.  By contrast, the recent action of Pope Benedict lifting the excommunication of holocaust-denying Bishop Williamson shows that the Papacy is lapsing into its old ways, despite the efforts of Pope John 23 and Pope John Paul II to reform the Roman Church in this regard.",1234396800,8,2726,5.503597122302159
3411375,3,B00181XY6M,"I got this DVD via a BuzzFlash promotion, and watched it w/my wife recently.

There is also a great deal about Carroll's own upbringing as a Catholic in an influential Air Force family - which is interesting in its own right, but unfortunately dilutes the narrative here, and give some critics ammunition to claim it's strictly personal rather than an across-the-board indictment of Christian antisemitism. The presentation also skips around far too much between Haggard, USAF Vet Mikey Weinstein, the Jewish Quarter in Venice, Sister Rose Therling's life, the Holocaust, Pope Benedict, Carroll's own experiences as an Air Force Brat and later priest, the Vietnam War...and a bunch of other stuff as well, and is clumsily handled in too many cases by the documentary's director, Oren Jacoby.

He was the founding director of the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations, and then the founding director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; it was he who brought the photos of Russian missles in Cuba to Kennedy's attention.

The younger Carroll grew up on military bases, met John XXIII with his family as a teenager, and in the wake of the nuclear uncertainty of the Cold War, opted to pursue those things that would last. His first mass was celebrated at a chapel on an Air Force base; growing disillusioned with the war in Vietnam, and feeling called to follow the Prince of Peace, he slipped in just a tiny allusion in that first homily. He preached on Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones; he mentioned they had been burned by the sun. More than that, burned by napalm. Such a tiny rebellion-such a miniscule insult to the military-but enough to drive a wedge between James and Joseph.

Carroll was a priest from 1969-1974, increasingly active in opposing the war, which destroyed his faith in both governmental and churchly authority. In an interview from those days he notes the silence of the US Catholic hierarchy to the bombing of civilians in Vietnam and opines, ""Were US bombers dropping contraceptives on the Vietnamese, the American Catholic hierarchy would have condemned it quickly; but we were dropping napalm, and they said nothing.""

These personal stories are sketched throughout the movie, which begins at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, and the issue of aggressive evangelization of non-Christians, especially Jewish students, by evangelical churches in the area and by evangelical faculty, staff and students of the Academy. He interviews Academy graduate Mikey Weinstein, who was shocked when one of his two sons then at the Academy told him of anti-Jewish slurs he had been subjected to, and of the aggressive promotion of ""The Passion of the Christ"" by the Academy.

Carroll uses this incident to launch into a discussion of two issues: the history of Christian hostility to Jews, and of the linkage of Christianity with military power. He visits Milvian Bridge outside Rome, and Constantine's vision of a cross with the motto, ""In hoc signo vinces,"" becomes the guiding metaphor for the book-""Cross and sword become one. Christianity turns violent.""

He surveys how this baptized violence spread across Europe, and became a means to unite feuding Christian kingdoms in a war against a common enemy, the Muslim ""infidel""-and against closer enemies, against whom Christians had a long-standing grudge.

Carroll relates how he grew up in a typical Irish-Catholic family, trusting in a holy church with holy saints, priests and bishops. Now he saw those ""holy"" priests and bishops calling for bloody conquest, even leading pogroms against Jews in the name of Christ.

He travels to Spain, where Jews were first forced to convert to Christianity; then, when Christians became suspicious of the integrity of those they had forcibly converted, the Spanish Inquisition was created to investigate and to punish. When Jews were expelled from Spain, many were welcome in Rome, until 1555, when chief Roman inquisitor Giovanni Cardinal Caraffa became Pope Paul IV, who restricted Jewish intercourse with Christians and created a ghetto in which they must live.

Though recent popes, especially John Paul II, have taken great strides to repair relations with Jews, Carroll doesn't think they've gone far enough. John Paul denounced Nazi antisemitism, but blamed it on neo-paganism, refusing to acknowledge that another part of its foundation was the legacy of Christian anti-Judaism, of accusations of ""Christ-killer"" and the blood libel. Only this can explain the collusion of many Catholic prelates with Nazism. He goes to Trier, where one of the supposed relics brought back from the Holy Land by Helena, the Robe of Christ, has been kept since the time of Constantine. The Bishop of Trier supported the National Socialists in the election of 1933, and to celebrate their victory, arranged for the Robe to be displayed. Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen represented Hitler, and, with the bishop, sent a telegram to Hitler pledging their mutual cooperation. While it was on display, Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) signed the concordat with Hitler-protecting the institutional church while accepting Nazi rule. Pacelli might not have been ""Hitler's Pope,"" says Carroll, but he was certainly ""Hitler's Cardinal.""

That same year Edith Stein wrote to the pope to warn of Nazi antisemitism and of the dark future that would face Europe's Jews; five years later, now known as Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, she lamented in her diary that the pope had never bothered to respond ... and that all she had predicted had come true. This wasn't mentioned in her canonization in 1998; she was canonized as a martyr, despite the fact that she went to Auschwitz not because of her Catholic faith, but for her Jewish blood.

In Rome, the anti-Jewish legislation of Paul IV was rescinded when Italy unified and the pope was banished to the Vatican; it was revived by Mussolini, however, and when in 1943 Mussolini rounded up the Jews of Rome to deport to Auschwitz, the pope said nothing. A survivor says in the film, ""If the pope had only taken the trouble to go outside the gate-and not say anything, just do as he did when Rome was bombed-just go outside the gate and stand in silence, with his arms raised in the form of a cross, there might never have been a deportation. Italians and German Catholics would not have gone along with it."" But he never appeared.

Carroll affirms the strides taken forward by the Catholic Church in the latter part of the 20th century, especially the ""change that mattered most"" at Vatican 2, the decree, Nostra Aetate. But he wonders how much it has sunk in. He speaks with Fr. Stanislaw Obirek, a Polish Jesuit, suspended by his order because, Carroll says, he wanted a fuller accounting for the Catholic Church's role in Polish antisemitism.

Returning to the US, Carroll listens to the rhetoric of George Bush's ""war on terror""-language of ""crusade,"" ""good vs. evil,"" ""God is not neutral""-and hears echoes of past attempts to fuse cross and sword That's what frightens him about what he saw happening at the Air Force Academy; it appears to be a case of religion and military power coming together, with young evangelicals in the military inspired by their religious zeal to fight Middle East enemies. This isn't the spirit of Jesus, but the spirit of Constantine, which is still alive after 1700 years.

The movie can be faulted for its disparagement of Scripture (Carroll accepts uncritically whatever Elaine Pagels tells him), but it remains a powerful testimony to the experiences of those who have been cut by Constantine's sword.",1220486400,70,7194,5.014237855946399

8268323,3,B00181XY6M,"this reflects on how some christians throughout the years acted toward jews mainly.  Which is a very sad and horrible story.  We have come a long way though and this also shows how at the time evangelicals were allowed to preach at the AIr force academy. This effort was lead by ted haggerty,  who was one of the most powerful preachers in AMERICA.  he fell from grace after it came out he was sleeping with a gay man prostitute.  Ironically Haggerty's church did some good leading the way to  a better understanding of environmental  issues among churches.  But few have fallen so far as he did.  And the church had yet to be attacked by a antichristian madman either.  three died. The movie covers how mainly the catholic church is responsible for many horrible actions against the jews.  Or were silent about what was happening to them.  It's biased a but filled with facts too.  We need to move away from any mention of god in war for sure.  I will agree with him on that. This doesn't mean we don't fight wars though.  The dvd has a good picture and it moves quickly as we learn this man's story.",1469836800,,1101,4.435
