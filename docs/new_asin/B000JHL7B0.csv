8150390,5,B000JHL7B0,"Bob Carver's ""Fighting Secrets of Muay Thai"" video series provides an excellent background on Muay Thai fundamentals, focusing, in particular, on the importance of proper form and execution.  He uses the saying ""you have to learn to crawl before you walk and learn to walk before you run"" which is precisely the progression the videos make.  I would recommend this as a great training aid to supplement your own Muay Thai school's teachings.  Most of the techniques and methods presented are directly in-line with my school's format and teachings.  Carver's presentation of the science behind the techniques is sound and leaves little room for confusion, allowing one to quickly execute good formed offensive and defensive techniques.",1334534400,2,734,5.301724137931035
8150391,5,B000JHL7B0,"This DVD is very clearly laid out in a logical sequence. Ideal for Muay Thai, Muay Lao, or Pradal Seray (Khmer boxing) students. A lot of time if you are training in Asia your instructor does not speak good English. Using the DVD you can both understand concepts better and visually show the instructor what you want to learn.",1314921600,,326,4.5423728813559325
8150392,5,B000JHL7B0,"Carver offers great instruction with a very high quality video series. The process is catered to all learning styles and broken down clearly as tell, show, do. Easy to pick up on some basic Muay Thai moves. I watch mine regularly and use his drills in my MMA class. The price is kinda steep as far as DVDs go but you clearly get what you pay for, Carver comes across as a humble and very helpful instructor.",1164758400,7,407,4.298701298701299
