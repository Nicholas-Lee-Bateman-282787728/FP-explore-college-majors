840477,3,6304312040,"This is one of my favorite mini series that I hoped would be in DVD form.  I wanted it a lot so I bought the VHS version.  Because it was taped on one cassette on slow speed, I could not adjust the tracking to get decent picture quality.  I was pretty disappointed, especially since the movie was in its entirety and not edited.",1230076800,4,328,4.174603174603175
840478,5,6304312040,"It is a long,but good movie. I wish It was on DVD,so I can watch it anytime I want instead of the VHS version I videotaped from tv. I hope my marriage,as soon as I get my engagement ring from Trent is not a Deadly Matrimony.",1142726400,2,224,3.891304347826087
840479,4,6304312040,"To think about this type of criminal activity having a chance to exist is unexplainable.  I don't understand the audacious mindset of a mob boss thinking he could ""own"" a city and its law enforcement ranks, but these circumstances are exactly what Jack Reed encountered.  Treat Williams plays the role of Masters eerily well.  Dennehy of course, is splendid in the role of Reed. He knows Masters is a murderer without remorse, but he also knows the corrupt department he works for is just waiting for him to make one false move...",1100476800,10,530,4.739130434782608

7867747,5,6304312040,"This movie is based on a true story. It is sad, scary, sick, and keeps a persons interest. One of Brian Dennehy's

7867752,1,6304312040,"I am very unhappy with my purchase. I bought Deadly Matrimony and was so excited to get it, once i popped it into the VCR it was jumping, the sound was up and down and half the time you coulnt even see the picture because of all of the lines going through the screen. We tried to track it with absolutely no luck. I fast forwarded and then rewound thinking that the tape might just be loose and we didn't have any luck. It is pointless to even try to watch the movie because it is such a disapointment.",1324598400,,502,4.08080808080808
