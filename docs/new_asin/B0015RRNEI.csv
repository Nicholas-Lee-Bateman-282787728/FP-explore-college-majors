I did and uploaded them to my youtube channel along with movies, cartoons etc. HEY AMAZON as much cash as I've spent with you, you can't get TOO mad at me for giving a heads up.",1350864000,4,316,4.19672131147541
3147240,5,B0015RRNEI,fairly good product. the two best dvd sets are ken burns 'the war' and 'the world at war' an english production in cooperation with the imperial war muesum. those two cover the war completely. all of these i purchased from amazon,1320192000,2,229,4.609756097560975
3147241,4,B0015RRNEI,"These are some of the ""classics"" from WWII and it's great to see them on DVD in uncut form, as originally presented.  These are Technicolor films, not colorized, although time has taken its toll on some sections of the original films (for instance, you'll see some streaking in the film, and a few segments appear monochromatic).

If you are looking for an objective documentary about WWII that describes battles in detail, presents all sides of the story, and offers analysis in hindsight, look elsewhere. These are wartime films as presented in local cinemas, and although the footage is generally authentic the films do have a certain propagandistic tone characteristic of the time.  The worst offender is probably ""Battle of Midway,"" a John Ford piece, which also includes some recreated scenes and staged shots (much of the shots are real, and it's pretty easy to spot them, making it priceless nonetheless).  As a historian the value here is twofold: the remarkable scenes captured on color film, and the window these films provide into wartime America.  While it seems corny today, ""Battle of Midway"" was a well-received film during the war.  ""With the Marines at Tarawa"" was an extremely controversial piece when it was released during the war--with this DVD, you can see why. Personally, I get more out of watching these originals than I do from most of the newer documentaries out there.

From a technical standpoint, there is some noticeable compression from the digital transfer and the films are therefore not as crisp as I would have liked.  They do look good though--and better on the television than on my computer screen.  I had trouble getting the sound to work on my television/BluRay player at first, but had no trouble getting sound when I played it on my computer.  I put the disk back into the BluRay player after that, and for some reason the sound was fine.",1312243200,4,1882,4.889937106918239
3147242,2,B0015RRNEI,"I was really disapointed in this one and had to stop whatching it half way through. IF your serious about history, which I am, this isn't it for you. It's basically a colorized Hollywood production. Although, If you like seeing the old stars of Hollywood in those days you might enjoy it.",1272067200,11,288,4.5576923076923075
3147243,5,B0015RRNEI,"If you are interested in WWII, this is a great addition to your collection. You have seen sub-sets of this footage in documentaries like ""War In The Pacific"" and ""The World At War"". This is a foot-soldier or airman look at the war, not a strategic explanation of it.
These are the chapters available:

The Battle of Midway:
This is the poorest of them. Unfortunately, the audio consist of contemporary propaganda. But the video is worth it. It consist of on site scenes of the attack at midway, some shipboard scenes, and some wing camera footage

Thunderbolts:
This is the best of them. It is a well narrated view of the actions of a squadron of fighter-bombers in Italy. The great footage was obtained with multiple cameras attached in different parts of airplanes. This one justifies the purchase.

The Memphis Belle:
Another good one. Similar to the above, but with a B-17 bomber from England.

With The Marines at Tarawa:
About half of this film appears in other documentaries you have seen somewhere else. Still, it is a great documentary. I noted that the sad nature of this bloody fight makes it difficult to appreciate it's value.

Challenge to Democracy:
This film is used to justify the internment of Japanese-Americans. It is not at par with the rest of the presentation, but it has value if look at in the contemporary set of mind.",1268265600,19,1344,4.726495726495727

8259700,4,B0015RRNEI,"The seller of this series provided a great price, delivery and service - but the collection itself is a bit lacking.  Its not bad, just not overwhelmingly good.  There are a number of series titled ""WWII in Color"" and this is NOT the Television series which was so good.  This series is great but a bit disjuncted - its more like they built the series around the footage they had instead of a cohesive front to back story.",1364515200,3,422,4.384615384615385
