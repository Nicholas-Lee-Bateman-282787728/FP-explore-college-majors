If you do own them you can get it anyway!  I loved all of the X-Men movies.  My favourite so far is the newest one, The Wolverine.  Thank you Marvel for releasing such a cool box set with a very cool collectable claw.  Thank you.",1375142400,5,369,3.789473684210526
5892788,3,B00E6D4HHO,"So another special limited collector's platinum edition gets to see the light of the day.
I'm not going to lie: this one looks really awesome BUT there are of course some things I don't like about it.

1. The name: Okay, this is just me being a nitpicker but on June 18, 2013 Marvel released a boxset called Wolverine: The Adamantium Collection which includes the most important stories about Wolverine. The X-Men universe is so diverse, why couldn't they come up with a different name hence both collections are released within half a year from another and it may confuse some people.

2. The claw: I don't have anything against the idea that they used the Wolverine claw at all. I like the character and I understand that he's one of the most famous characters (or did you see a movie which was just about Cyclops, Storm, etc?). The thing is, and I speak from experience because I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-Phase-One-Avengers-Assembled-10-Disc-Limited-Edition-Six-Movie-Collector-s-Set-Blu-ray/dp/B0083SBMGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled (10-Disc Limited Edition Six-Movie Collector's Set) [Blu-ray</a>], how they are going to implement it. With the aforementioned collector's set at first you got to see a nice suitcase including an imitation of the Tesseract but once I finally received it (I'm living in Germany, so I got it like 3 days after the release, thanks to Amazon!) my heart dropped a little... The case was smaller than I expected, made out of hard plastic - which wasn't that bad though, and the tesseract is just a chunk of white plastic which lights up.
It's comprehensible that a bigger case made out of metal would be much more expensive to produce but most of the people who buy such things are collectors as the name states and therefore ready to pay a little bit more if the quality is right.
I don't want to talk excessively about that collection now but I'm just worried the same thing will happen to this one: a fake-leather glove with silver plastic claws.

3. The movies: First of all I don't have anything against the X-Men movies. I think some of them are great while others are not so great but you have this problem in every movie franchise. I'm just happy that they are still making movies about the X-Men. BUT if you are going to release such a collection and you know that another movie is coming out a few months after this release WHY couldn't you just wait some more months to make this collection a definite complete collection or at least make THIS one a special edition for the new Wolverine movie? I hate having 5 different complete collections just because there are a few things different from one another (i.e. the Bonus disc from Iron Man 2 which is omitted from the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 1 Collection for whatever reason..).

Enough ranting for today. I'm sorry for any mistakes I made but English is not my native tongue ;)",1375056000,49,3022,5.038

The Adamantium Collection

Own the ultimate limited-edition gift set created for the ultimate X-Men fan! The Limited Edition Adamantium Collection Gift Set features an exclusive tribute to Wolverine's adamantium claws -- reflecting Logan's e...xtraordinary strength and power -- along with all 6 X-Men movies -- including The Wolverine available for the first time -- PLUS an all-new bonus documentary.

I know what you're thinkin', bub. Question is, can I get Wolverine before he turns me into shishkabob with those claws? Well, bub, seein' as how these claws are adamantium, the strongest metal known, and can slice through vanadium steel like a hot knife through butter, buddy, you gotta ask yourself. Do I feel lucky? My name is Wolverine. I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice. *SNIKT*",1374969600,7,1079,6.333333333333333

Because it comes with Wolverines freaking hand and claws...cool. Could have been literally anything else. Magnetos helmet? Xaviers school? A Brian Cox bust? Nope.

These movies are some of my favorite and were bought for me for my birthday.

Will not play on US machines.  I was so bummed out but just watched the rest of them that were all fine.  My boyfriend made it up to me and bought me a replacement one because we couldn't find a way to complain to Amazon about it.

5893133,4,B00E6D4HHO,The sleeve of the set was kind of damaged on the corners but nothing too bad. Also the 6 disc case itself was pretty much useless because it was broken but i replaced it with a different 6 disc case. These didn't really bother me though because the price was so low. All the discs work perfectly fine so im happy.,1414886400,,313,4.147540983606557
5893134,5,B00E6D4HHO,"I could not believe the price when I saw this set on the Amazon website, all the films (With the exception of X-men Days of Future Past) on blu-Ray for under $30! The discs are all single edition, without any bonus discs. You will notice that Most of them are labeled disc 1, meaning that were originally part of a two disc set. For someone like me, just wanting all the films on blu-Ray for binge watching is fine. I did not need all the bonus stuff. It would have been nice to have, but for the price, I can do without. All the films look fantastic. Not problems with audio synch or other issues. Some people have complained about the fact that the discs are labeled 1 of 2, like they were taken from a multi dick set, but I don't really care. Just glad to have all the films on blu-Ray in a double case (I get a little limited on space).if you are one, that likes to have the bonus features, and possibly the director's cut, then I suggest you buy the films separately, or search for a box set that delves into the features more hardcore fans want. No matter what you choose, these films are great! Enjoy!!!!!!",1414886400,9,1113,4.254716981132075

5893136,5,B00E6D4HHO,"AMAZING! If you are like me and don't really watch bonus features then this is the set for you! All of the blu rays work with no problem, I really cant think of any reason not to like this set. Each blu ray is labeled ""Disk 1"" but it doesn't bother me because it doesn't take away from the actual Movie Experience. I Highly Recommend!!",1414627200,,335,4.1692307692307695

The reviews have been plenty helpful for me to determine that I won't being paying a dime towards something that was slapped together so cheaply.

Aside from that, this honestly was a great deal. I bought this on sale at about $29.99. Honestly it is worth it to have all 5 movies for such a low price, which is about $6 a bluray movie.

I figured out if you take it out and put it back in, sometimes it would fix it. I haven't had this happen before on any DVD/Blueray, so I assume it is because of the quality of these blue rays.

5893226,4,B00E6D4HHO,"The X-Men film series is one of the best comic book/superhero adaptations ever put on film. Since the series debuted with the first film in 2000, there have been 7 films to date.

This set compiles the first 6 films (X-Men, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, X-Men First Class, and the Wolverine.) The only film not included is Days of Future Past, which as of the time I am writing this, is still in theaters.

It is a pretty bare bones package but it gets the job done. Individual bonus discs from earlier reissues are not included; each film is one disc only and only has what bonus features were included on the same disc as the movie itself. While I would liked to have had all of these features in the set, it is likely going to mean very little to people that just want to get and watch the movies, which is precisely who this set will appeal to.

The other problem is that the Wolverine is the theatrical PG-13 cut, and not the unrated Director's Cut version. I wish they would have included both cuts of the movie; currently you can only get the Director's cut in the Deluxe Sex of the Wolverine that has the main film in 3D (and the Director's Cut, even in that set, is just 2D. Go figure.) Still, no arguing that the Director's Cut should have been included here.

If you are a fan of the X-Men films, this set is often on sale on here for a low, affordable price you should not pass up. It's the cheapest, quickest, and easiest way to get all of the movies to date on home video in one place, flaws aside.",1402185600,8,1549,4.276450511945392

Biggest plus?  It contains the new 'Wolverine' film - which was nearly as expensive as this set when they were released.

The one fact to note:  this is a BARGAIN set!  So the discs are from previous printings of the films.  So they weren't pressed for this collection specifically, but were unpackaged or unsold discs from other sets.  The films included are:
X-men (2000)
X-2 (2003)
X-men Last Stand (2006)
X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)
X-Men First Class (2011)
The Wolverine (2013)

be stored neatly in the side of the base. As for the wolverine claw, it is
attached to the base securly. Even the tip of the claw is attached. So kids
will not play with it unless they break the base.

5893266,3,B00E6D4HHO,"I was excited to see an X-Men package at my local retailer and picked it up, knowing I would enjoy all 6 movies. When I brought it home and opened it, I learned how cheap they were to toss this thing together. The first 3 movies clearly have ""Disc 1"" printed on the label, letting you know (if you're knowledgeable in collecting movies/games/etc.) that they simply took the discs from unsold packages (probably ones with expired digital copy/Ultraviolet codes) and threw them in this nice looking box. The other three movies (Origins, First Class, The Wolverine) didn't have any marking they came from another package, save for the Wolverine discs don't even share the same print as the first three movies (though they have ""Disc 1"" printed on them, they're uniform.) First class almost had the same print, but is still different enough to bother a collector. It also bothers me to see that you're apparently buying a collection, with the intent of apparently HAVING a collection, not a piece of a collection. You won't get special features discs for more than half of the movies, but I will say that in the least, you get the feature presentation. Still, if you're going to package a collection, put the entire collection in there instead of half-assing it.

If you're a collector, just stay away from this. If you must have the pretty box art in your collection, go and find that one friend of yours that everyone has, that takes all of their movies out of their cases, collectible, or not, and throws the case away, just to slip the discs into a binder, and steal the case from their trash can and leave them to wonder where on earth their disc 2s are.",1388620800,191,1655,4.629251700680272

The picture and sound quality are what you would expect from Blu-Ray, but the special features are lacking for the first 2 movies (not even deleted scenes!).

I just got the claw package for my younger brother's gift, so now I can review both the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adamantium-Collection/dp/B00E6D4HHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adamantium Collection</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-and-the-Wolverine-Collection/dp/B00FLML7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men and the Wolverine Collection</a>. To be honest, I had every intention to keep the claw for myself, but I guess I am getting too old, and it didn't help that the claw is not as extra ordinary as I would like it to be. I think this package is not worth the list price. It would be a nice product if the list price was around $80, because the quality of the claw and the stand is too cheap for the hefty list price. If you forget about the price, it will be a nice package, and the new printed labels for all the discs are nicer than previous releases. The claw is a little smaller than what I thought it would be; precisely, it is 15"" tall and 6.5"" wide. The discs contents are the same as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-and-the-Wolverine-Collection/dp/B00FLML7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men and the Wolverine Collection</a>&nbsp;that I previously got, but there is one extra disc called Legacy X. Legacy X disc is about one hour, and it has 6 short clips that are exclusive to the Adamantium package: X-Men, X2, X-Men Last Stand, Wolverine, X-Men First class, and ""What's Next."" These clips go through the history of casting and making of the X-Men universe.

Update 12-11-2013:

My review was for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-and-the-Wolverine-Collection/dp/B00FLML7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men and the Wolverine Collection</a>. You know, the normal one with 6 bare discs and no bells and whistles. Amazon has merged my review and many others' into other products like the claw package and Adamantium collection, and theirs into the Wolverine collection!! It is a mess I know, and I think is misleading. If you are reading any review on any of these items, you probably need to track which product the review is written for.

Original Review:

I got this the other day. First impression, it doesn't look anything like other box sets like TDK Trilogy; precisely, the box is too narrow/thin. The picture here has an impression that the box is at least one inches in depth, but the whole box is almost as thick as a normal BD case. You can see the pictures I've uploaded for more details.

The cover artwork of this box set looks the same as the normal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adamantium-Collection/dp/B00FOJ0ROQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adamantium Collection </a>&nbsp;(not the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/limited-claw-package/dp/B00E6D4HHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">limited claw package</a>); however unlike Adamantium, there is nothing special about this set. You only get 6 bare/plain discs. They have the same artwork as the individual discs previously found in earlier X-Men releases, so nothing special here either. There is only one disc for each movie, so don't expect special features and extras from this set. The Wolverine is only in 2D version, and it is not the uncut/unleashed version.

There is one strange issue with this box set. When I first got home, I noticed 4 spots an inch from each corner in the back of the box set cover. The two top-left and top-right ones are more pronounced, and they look like water/oil leakages half an inch in diameter. I didn't open the first box, and went to another BB store to exchange it. They had 9 available, but to my surprise, they all had this leakage problem. They were almost in the same spot, but different patterns. Upon close inspection, I noticed that there is something inside the cardboard that has a bumpy feeling to the touch. My guess is, underneath the cardboard there are security devices or glue or something that have exploded or over leaked. Since all the 10 boxes that I examined had this problem, if you are too picky about your box sets, make sure you can return the item if needed. You can also go to a store and check this out yourself.

Overall, even with the leakage spots, I kept the box set. I didn't own any of these movies in Blu-ray format, and buying them separately would've cost a little more. Of course, if you buy them separately, you will end up with two discs or three discs sets which will contain extras and bonuses. My first idea was to get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Trilogy-box-set/dp/B001PPGAKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Trilogy box set</a>, and then get the First Class, Origins, and The Wolverine separately. It would end up being a little more than this box set, but I would have had all the bonus features. I changed my mind at the end, because having all these movies in a one small package is more convenient, and the next X-Men movie is due for next year, so there will be more appealing box sets soon.

5893283,5,B00E6D4HHO,"X-Men and the Wolverine Collection is a great price for all six movies in a Blu-ray format.  The box set collection comes with awesome cover art on each disk.  With this combo pack you get the original first three x-men movies ( X-Men, X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand).  Also within this combo you get X-Men: First Class, The Wolverine, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  This combo pack would be a great holiday gift for someone you care about, or maybe for yourself as well.  If you are not familiar with these films I have included a quick summary of each movie.

The Wolverine is a 2013 is the sixth installment in the X-Men film series and the second film headlining Wolverine after X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009.

When the X-Men came out in theaters in 2000 I was ecstatic.  And since then the love has not changed.  So when the Adamantium Collection came out I had to have it.  And it is worth every penny to me (my opinion).  Anyone who loves the X-Men and Wolverine as much as I do, this Collection is for you.  It has every X-Men movie and Wolverine movie, as well as an open spot for X-Men Days of Future Past.  Must buy for Huge X-Men fans!",1386115200,6,589,4.290909090909091

5893289,5,B00E6D4HHO,How can anyone write a review for a product not released yet. I think it looks great my final decision will be when i GET the product. They did the same for the new batman box set. And thank  GOD I didn't listen because it ended being a gorgeous set. you have no idea what the claw is made of or how it will feel in your hands. if you wanna say it sucks after you get then fine but not before it hasn't been released unless you aquired some other way migHt that may not EVEN be the real one. look i bought all the blu rays and now i buying this but i don't look at as lost money i get to give my old to my best friend who cant afforfd it and he is so excite that alone is worth it. SO to ALLL the other people reading don't go by what people are saying who haven't even purchased it yet it comes out Dec 2. After people receive them then check out the reviews to better judge or like myseld i don't always go by what people say. its a 124 dollard how much more do they want for that price??

I mean, obviously I didn't buy this for the movies, who hasn't watched all the movies already? Duh? I thought it would be great to add to my ""Everything Hugh Jackman"" collection in my garage.

FIRST, unlike what was described on the box, I DO NOT SEE ANY ADAMANTIUM ANYWHERE. Did I get a dud, or is this a blatant rip-off?? I knew $129 was too good to be true, when an extremely rare metal like adamantium would probably cost more than its weight in gold.

SECOND, after sniffing the claw, I do not smell any of Jackman's sweat. Is this even an authentic Wolverine claw? On close inspection, I did not even find a single strand of body hair or skin flake.

8601968,3,B00E6D4HHO,"Shortcut Review:
The collection set of the original X-Men plus X-Men: First Class, X-Men Origins and The Wolverine, so it's a total of six films in all together. Say what you want about rating each movie based on opinions, but what I care more for what's inside this box set. If I wouldn't be buying this set if I didn't enjoy any of these X-Men films.

Delivery: Bought from Amazon seller, so the package arrived just in time as expected. No damages.
Aesthetics: The box is a glossy, yet highly-artsy with visual graphics, cardboard cover that is slipped onto the blu-ray case. The blu-ray case has the exact print of the cardboard art. The image on the amazon page appears as a hefty book, but the actual set is small. The art on every disc looks amazing: it shows high print quality of every, major mutant like Wolverine and Magneto.

Content & Features: Don't expect too much on bonus features because its close to non-existent. It has the typical content like deleted scenes, behind the scenes, and audio/caption settings. The menu is straight-forward and the interface is easy to use, but the graphics for menu is quite terrible. I mean, we're talking 2013 here and the visual art should at least decent, but it's disappointing.

Summary: In all what it's worth the price of $50 is okay, but I kinda wish there a lot content into this collection set. At the time of purchase, I was willing to look for the ultimate collection and pay the highest premium, but there actually wasn't any around other than X-Men Rogue Collection.",1515110400,3,1532,4.687732342007435
