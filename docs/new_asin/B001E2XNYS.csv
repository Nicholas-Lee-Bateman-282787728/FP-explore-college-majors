8296154,5,B001E2XNYS,"I know that I purchased this collection for an extreme amount of money, but I couldn't be happier.
The collection came promptly within a few days and was exactly as the description was stated. All still in their shrink wrap and untouched.
I have been looking for about ever for this collection and when I saw it, even at the ridiculous price it was at, I knew I had to have it.
I mean, I could have easily just torrented the files, but there is just something about owning the real thing that makes it worth while.
Thank You!",1370649600,,525,4.313131313131313

8296156,5,B001E2XNYS,Chaotic Century was by far my favorite ZOIDS show; I loved it all through middle school.  But I think I'll just wait until I go back home next summer and buy it cheap at the used media store.  $1500 isn't even realistic.,1320019200,7,220,4.214285714285714
8296157,1,B001E2XNYS,"This is one of my favorite shows from childhood, and I know a ton of people are looking to buy these. That being said, no TV series is worth even close to $1000, let alone the price this guy is asking for it. When is this person going to learn no one will buy it?

Especially since ebay single dvds are sometimes as low as $20 a piece? Get a grip, and lower the price already if you ever hope to sell these.",1319241600,18,407,3.9036144578313254
8296158,5,B001E2XNYS,I love zoids and it is one of the series I believe changed the art industry as far as action in an anime goes. Zoids is very colorful and awesome. Great storyline and characters. Just not worth 1300.00 used.,1315008000,3,207,4.333333333333333
