8327520,3,B001NOGPR4,Great Australian series but  struggles a bit after diver dan leaves!!,1424995200,,69,5.2727272727272725
8327521,5,B001NOGPR4,"Quality escapist story telling with a brilliant balance of humour and seriousness, even profundity.  The first series is the best due to the presence of the unbeatably quirky, sexy and lovable Diver Dan played by David Wenham. What can't he do?

But the cast and the writing are uniformly strong and Sigrid Thornton carries the show without flagging.

But all three series of Seachange are still better than most of the stuff out there now and in the 90s.",1289779200,4,555,4.653061224489796

When family scandal forces this corporate lawyer and children to leave for life in a small seaside town, her new job as the local magistrate (judge) puts the main character smack in the middle of another way of being. Adjusting to living her dream brings the new judge into contact with a series of very funny, utterly endearing, outlandish locals who respect the law while doing things their own way.

Why this series has not been shown on cable TV in the USA is a mystery. If you're interested in contemporary life in Australia, or you would simply like to be thoroughly entertained watch ""SeaChange"", it is the beginning of a string of Aussie hits like ""Summer Heights High"", ""Kath and Kim"" and ""Welcome to Woop Woop"". Though the price of the entire 4 series of ""SeaChange"" is a bit if a shock, if you have an all-region DVD player, you can purchase the first series, a 4 DVD box set, for about US$49
