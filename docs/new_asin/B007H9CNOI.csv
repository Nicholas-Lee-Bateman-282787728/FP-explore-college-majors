5085856,5,B007H9CNOI,"I felt like I had to redeem this products honour, since it only had one star from the previous review.

Personally, this was the perfect combination of two products for me. I can see how people sees it as a blasphemous move to put these two products together, but it just worked out.

I had just bought the Chosen Collection with season 1 - 7, and I needed the movie plus the motion comic season 8, so this product worked out perfect for me. Plus it was cheap!

On a final note, it's worth mentioning that Joss Whedon was involved in the 1992 movie, and even though he left in post-production, I feel like it's worth preserving, just for the history of it. So the two products aren't that unrelated after all.",1353456000,26,709,4.356060606060606
5085857,1,B007H9CNOI,"Why would you put these two together? It's an insult to Buffy, Buffy fans and Joss Whedon.

1992 Buffy is not Buffy",1337299200,5,115,4.2272727272727275
5085858,4,B007H9CNOI,"I bought this in particular, cause it's cheaper to bye this set of 2, then separately. So that sold me immediately. The movie is not very good, but it's still a part of the Buffy collection. I feel the same way about the comic, it's more like someone reading to you and showing you the pages. Over-all, buy it to complete your collection, it's a great deal.",1409443200,,357,4.343283582089552
5085859,3,B007H9CNOI,"ALwya ready for more Buffy, but the motion comics don't really pull me into the story like animation, tv, film or comics.  If you want to get the best out of these stories, stick to reading them in their graphic novel formats",1409184000,6,225,4.357142857142857
5085860,2,B007H9CNOI,"The Original Buffy Movie is cool to have in there, love it. The Post Apocalyptic NIGHTMARE in the Season 8 Comics is beyond insane. I don't mind watching the comic version. To me, you save the world, you save the world. ALL Joss Whedon, or pretty much all, stories~series end in this fashion-or they are on their way to. Take Dollhouse: YUP there is a post man-made Armageddon all right. But our Heroine (Eliza Dushku, AKA: Echo~Caroline) leads our Merry Band to fix it. I'm not going to make a whole list. I am usually a fan of, well, Fan Fiction. I don't care for this story line and I don't recommend it. Buy ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" THE MOVIE instead....",1407369600,3,660,4.462809917355372
5085861,2,B007H9CNOI,"My all time favorite tv show is Buffy, so when i found this, season 8 I ordered it. It was a huge disappointment, its hard to watch, its not actually a cartoon, more like a comic book that they put into movie form. i don't recommend it.",1395273600,10,236,4.042553191489362
5085862,5,B007H9CNOI,"Was very happy with the product and service, everything went according to what was promised and the product was actually in better shape then I was promised. I'm very happy with this Company and would buy from them again in the future if I saw a product I liked that they were selling.",1392336000,,285,4.39622641509434
5085863,5,B007H9CNOI,You definetly will go down memory lane with this. Recommended for any joss whedon and buffy fan. I hope the story never ends.,1391040000,3,125,4.478260869565218
5085864,3,B007H9CNOI,"I only got this duel pack because I wanted Buffy Season 8 and it was cheaper to get it as a duel set then by itself.  As a hardcore Buffy fan it was VERY difficult to watch this season.  For several reasons: 1- They did not get the same actors from the series to do the voice acting and the only one who sounded anything similar to the original actor was Faith.  So it was hard to figure out who was talking because of reason 2:  this is NOT a regular cartoon, it is a choppy graphic animation that they put voice acting behind.  I also felt like the continued reintroduction of old villains who were long gone as any potential threat from the TV series was a bit ridiculous.  And making Buffy a coming out lesbian was also stupid.",1374537600,21,731,4.185714285714286
5085865,5,B007H9CNOI,I bought this because i had everything else (video series) from the series and I wanted to complete the run.,1372896000,,108,4.45
5085866,4,B007H9CNOI,"It's buffy so it's wonderful, I just wish it were the whole 8th season and not just the first 8 comic books of the 8th season (which is pretty much only 1/4th of the total season)",1365120000,7,179,4.0
5085867,5,B007H9CNOI,"This was the perfect gift for the Buffy collector.  She is hard to buy for, and this made the perfect final touch to her Christmas.",1358208000,,131,4.24
