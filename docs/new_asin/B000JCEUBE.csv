8150044,4,B000JCEUBE,I rented many DVDs to try and find some exercises I could and would do. This is basic weights and simple movements. So I bought it and have been doing them. That is the trick. Finding one that you will actually do.,1383696000,,214,4.119047619047619
8150045,4,B000JCEUBE,Some of the sound is a little sketchy in this DVD but has great practical advice on how to get back in shape for  older adults.,1362355200,4,127,3.8846153846153846
8150046,4,B000JCEUBE,"No irritating music (none at all), no matching outfits. Just ordinary people in ordinary clothes on a big deck overlooking a lagoon. The instructor talks, but just to explain how to do the moves correctly, what the purpose is, and which one to do next. The DVD cover lamentably identifies him as Dr. Dr., effectively (Dr. Name, PhD, rather than just PhD, as it should be), plus the pacing is quite slow, and he's not a polished presenter, but the DVD would be less appealing if it had the usual trappings, constant meaningless banter, and ""you're doing great!"" idiocy against annoying, cloying music. BUT he needs to lower the price to something commensurate with the topic and quality and other exercise videos: $14.99 (to $19.99, top). Then maybe people would actually buy it.

You can do segments that you select if you're short on time (it's an hour long, otherwise). And the exercises are all just what it says: practical, intended to keep people functionally fit in daily activities. They might keep you out of a nursing home someday, and that's invaluable. Yet they're not those limp, barely useful movements done sitting in chairs that others do for ""older adults"" or ""seniors."" All in all, this one is worth using often until you learn the moves and can do them without the DVD.

The instructor is quite well-qualified, too (from a WCSU faculty bio): Dr. Jeff Schlicht is an Assistant Professor of Health Promotion and Exercise Sciences. He completed his BA degree in Psychology at the University of California in San Diego, his MA degree in Physical Education at San Diego State University, and his Ph. D. degree in Exercise Science at the University of Connecticut (1999). His areas of interest and research include the health benefits associated with physical activity and exercise and gerontology. His past research projects have examined the effect of high- and moderate-intensity strength training programs for older adults, and the risks and benefits of stability ball training for older adult populations.",1288915200,4,2022,5.0148809523809526
