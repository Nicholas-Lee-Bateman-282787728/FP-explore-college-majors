2663154,3,B000IU37SO,"Woody Allen seems to have two personas: one writes and directs works such sensitive works as Matchpoint and Interiors, the other writes and directs himself in silly slapstick movies that only a Woody Allen fan tireless of his old used jokes and self promotion can tolerate, such as Scoop.

This flimsy film seems to have been designed to give Allen screentime for his tired jokes in the company of some very good actors. Splitting his tale between Charon's boat crossing the river Styx with recently departed dead people on board then transferring their conversations about the 'scoop' of revealing a society stud as a Tarot Serial Killer via the machinations of the ridiculous magician entry point into contemporary life, Allen cares little about plot cohesion and more about the quick one-liners.

The good thing about the film is the cast: Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Ian McShane, and  Romola Garai are creative actors who so their best to help Allen pull off this sleeper.  Definitely restricted audience for fans of Woody Allen's whiny humor only.  No wonder it failed in the theaters!  Grady Harp, November 06",1164153600,,1121,5.032432432432432
2663155,3,B000IU37SO,"""Scoop"" is admittedly clever in some respects, but it can get a little redundant and boring.

Woody Allen fans will like and appreciate this latest addition to film. It is classic Woody Allen in writing, style, and cinematography. However, to viewers who have not seen many of Allen's previous works (and therefore don't understand his style) ""Scoop"" might seem kind of weird, off-beat, and a little annoying.

Scarlett Johansson delivers a good performance as a young college journalist desperate to prove herself by investigating the scoop of the decade about the identity of a serial killer that she recieves from a the ghost of a dead journalist. However, her character becomes more than a little annoying in her mannerisms and the short, clipped way in which she speaks/babbles. This is meant to be comedic, I know, but it comes off as irritating.

Hugh Jackman also hands in a great performance as the object of Johansson's investigation. Who doesn't get tired of seeing Hugh Jackman without his shirt? Honestly! It's nice to see Jackman in a role that is far removed from his excellent turn as Wolverine in the X-men films. I love the X-men films, but sometimes you just want to see something different.

All in all, the film was entertaining, but I don't feel it's the ""Best Picture"" that many have been heralding it as. Even so, it's still worth watching.",1164067200,,1364,4.866379310344827
2663156,3,B000IU37SO,"Scoop doesn't try to change the world. Scarlett Johansson did a good job, Hugh Jackman is smooth and Woody Allen is funny as ever with his one liners that often become three liners. 90 minutes of guilt free viewing  and I mention below a few one liners from the film that definitely won't ruin it for you.

Sid Waterman [W.A] : I was born of the Hebrew persuasion, but I converted to narcissism.

----------------------------------------------

Sondra Pransky [S.J] : Oh, you always see the glass half empty.

Sid Waterman [W.A] : No, I always see the glass half full. Of poison!

------------------------------------------------

Sid Waterman : I don't need to work out. My anxiety acts as aerobics.

----

Scarlett doesn't really look quite pretty in this movie. Nonetheless, she acted good. Match Point is a bigger, better film which has no humor but has some kneejerking irony. It's a recommendation incase you haven't...

And oh, it was great to see Woody Allen on screen. He's talkative and as comfortable as ever.",1164067200,,1020,4.982248520710059
2663157,4,B000IU37SO,"Woody Allen seemed to be losing it at the start of the twenty-first century.  The films he released around that time (THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION, SMALL TIME CROOKS, etc.) failed to make a lasting (or for that matter positive) impression on audiences.  In 2004 he enjoyed something of a comeback with MELINDA AND MELINDA before bursting back on the scene with his thrilling masterwork MATCH POINT.  Now he's back to whip up another slice of cinema greatness, and this is a slice considerably sweeter than (though not as classy as) MATCH POINT.  This is SCOOP, one of the most delightful romantic comedies of the year.

SCOOP revolves around Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), an American college student eyeing a career in journalism.  While vacationing in England with a friend, she visits a magic show run by the timid Sid Waterman (Woody Allen).  Sid decides to use Sondra in a magic trick involving a box from which Sondra will supposedly disappear.  Instead of disappearing, Sondra watches as famous - and recently diseased - journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) appears.  Joe gives Sondra a tip on who may be the notorious ""Tarot Card Killer"" before vanishing into thin air.  Now it's up to Sondra, along with incompetent magician Sid, to follow a lead from a dead journalist and investigate the man who may be a vicious serial killer: irresistible (and rich) bachelor Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman).

SCOOP is a compelling and thoroughly entertaining picture.  It's not an unforgettable film, nor one that could be considered a moviemaking milestone.  Much of the film's charm comes from the fact that it doesn't try to be.  What it does try to be is a witty, entertaining, fun and funny mystery film, and that's exactly what it is.  Much of the credit for this should go to Allen's taut, fine-tuned script.  It has laughs a plenty, thrilling mystery, and not a slow spot in sight.

The rest of the credit goes to the cast.  Though most people are accustomed to seeing Johansson portray scalding hot blonde bombshells in films like THE BLACK DAHLIA and MATCH POINT, her performance as a geeky young college student is surprisingly convincing.  Jackman, as always,  shines; he's every bit as charismatic as his character, and then some.  With actors as great as these, it's a little surprising that Allen himself is the highlight of the cast.  Sid the magician's foolishness isn't irking at all; in fact, it's immensely amusing, and Sid winds up as an almost adorable character rather than the bothersome twit he could have been.  As a huge BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER fan, I was also immensely pleased to see Anthony Stewart Head pop up toward the end of the film as a detective.

Ashamed as I am to admit it, as of this writing I have seen only one other Woody Allen film, MATCH POINT.  Thus I can't make any remarks about where SCOOP ranks in comparison to Allen's many previous films.  I can and will say this, however: SCOOP is a delight.  It's not grand, and it doesn't try to be.  It is what it is: a very entertaining, very funny, very fun film, and a great way to spend two hours.",1161388800,46,3094,4.722014925373134
2663158,4,B000IU37SO,"This will bring to mind several other Allen films. Manhatten Murder Mystery, Curse Of the Jade Scorpion, and Broadway Danny Rose (Allen's Character in this draws quite a bit from the former character).

This movie is really a fun experience for the viewer. Scarlett Johansen is great in it as is Hugh Jackman. The script is witty and the action moves briskly along with beautiful shots of London as a bonus.

For Allen fans - this will be a nice return to his comedic form following the much more serious Match Point.",1160006400,9,517,4.608695652173913
2663159,4,B000IU37SO,"The movie theatre I work at in Memphis was the only place to see the film in the city and it attracted steady crowds who seemed to love it. Having seen the bulk of Woody's pre-1995 films, I thought this measured up pretty well with a lot of his better work. I classify it as ""light"" as far as his films go, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. As I told patrons at my theatre who asked if they should see it: if you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll enjoy it, and if you didn't like most of his past works, then you won't. This is a fun comedy that might predominately appeal to the tastes of older generations in its pace and humor, but hey, I'm 30 and really enjoyed it. Yes, it's much like Manhattan Murder Mystery (with a younger appeal, due to the savvy casting of current moviegoer faves, Scarlet Johansson and Hugh Jackman (my only criticism of Johansson is that, like some actors before her, she seems to take on too many of Allen's vocal affectations), but I see nothing wrong with that. Though typical Woody, it was a breath of fresh air amongst many of the other films this past summer. Like I said, if you like Woody...",1159920000,10,1129,4.280373831775701
2663160,5,B000IU37SO,"Sondra Prensky (Scarlett Johansson), a college journalist, encounters big-time journalist Joe Strombel's (Ian McShane) spirit.  He proceeds to giving her information that could mean the biggest scoop of his life, pertaining to aristocrat Peter Lyman(Hugh Jackman) and the Tarot Card murders.  With his advice, and the help of magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), she starts the investigation against Peter, but (predictably) falls in love with him. Is he the Tarot-card killer? Is she in any mortal danger?

I've always been a huge fan of Woody Allen, even though he's been in a little bit of a slump lately which he seems to have gotten out of since Match Point, so this might be biased.
This does resemble some of his earlier work, such as Manhattan Murder Mystery, so it might not seem very original.  But they were done so long ago that putting a modern spin to his genre works.

With that in mind, I absolutely LOVED Scoop. I'd say it was one of the best adult, smart, comedies (although comedy-mystery seems more appropriate) of 2006, joining the ranks of Little Miss Sunshine and Thank You For Smoking.
I thought the casting and the acting was on-pitch. Scarlett Johansson is competely believable as a young (and dare I say sometimes dorky) college journalist. Hugh Jackman was great, as it has come to be expected. And while I've never been huge on Woody Allen acting in his movies, here it works out great and he turns out to be actually quite endearing.  I thought his performance was great and completely in tune with the tone of the movie, and here he's hilarious, and I loved his sense of humor. But I especially liked the beginning when you see him doing magic tricks on stage as Splendini.

This is a movie I'd definitely recommend.  I had a really good time, and I ended up laughing for a great deal of the movie.  It's funny, entertaining, smart, and Woody Allen is one of the best. 5 Stars, no hesitation.",1158969600,38,1923,4.699404761904762

2663162,5,B000IU37SO,"I have to say that I've been avoiding Woody Allen's more dramatic movies lately, so this one was a welcome return to his more funnier style of comedies from his prime years.  And at least he finally had the good sense to cast himself as the older, ""father""-type character (or at least a cheesy, second-rate magician who's been roped into pretending to be the female reporter's father, anyway, which winds up adding a funny level to the story) instead of the much, MUCH too-old ""romantic"" interest with the much younger woman that he kept doing in his later movies for far longer than was believable; this father-daughter dynamic, even it's a pretend conceit for the plot, is much more believable (and much less creepy), and Allen also returns to his fascination with cheesy stage-magic/magicians that we've seen in past movies to good effect.  Although it's not his all-time best, it's still good and amusing and worth watching as an entertaining diversion. Plus his magician character does bear a welcome resemblance to his character in one of my favorites of his, ""Broadway Danny Rose"", in terms of his physical mannerisms and the way he tries to entertain people with his cheesy old-school lounge-act patter (""How old are you darling?  Seriously, you're a beautiful audience...""), which is pretty funny when he tries it on a bunch of upper-class British aristocrats at a manor house lawn party! :)  Recommended for fans of Woody Allen's comedies, or anyone just looking for an amusing & entertaining light comedy.",1432339200,,1516,4.980237154150197

2663172,5,B000IU37SO,"A slight film. Yet, all Woody Allen; and all  good. Allen is  one of the handful of directors in Hollywood (or anywhere else for that matter) who has given us a body of work, distinctive, unique, and entirely Him. He is among the few of whom one does not ask, should I see that one, but rather,  if a movie goer, one says, let us see what Mr. Allen has done this time.
One qualification, of course. You must be attracted to the world of Woody Allen as one had to be attracted to the world of Chaplin, Keaton, Ford or Hitchcock ( to name some of the few in his category). Each has his own identifying hallmarks, different from the others, but running throughout most of their films. If that view of the world, that tilt toward the unique, is not appealing, then you might enjoy this film or that, but overall, the director is not for you.
Woody here plays a small-time Brooklyn magician who is picking up work in England (for no apparent reason except that the production company was there). A young woman in the audience who is brought up to the stage to aid in the performance of the disappearing person trick finds herself confronted by the ghost of a reporter who has picked up a tip about a potentially great story and is passing the tip along to her. Somehow Woody is persuaded to join her in the quest for digging out the story; she is an American college student majoring in journalism  and he becomes her father for purposes of researching the story. From there on it is romance and laughs along with some mystery.
While I knew that the film was several years old when I saw it, still, I figured out beforehand, that Allen would have reached the age at which even Cary Grant knew he could not play a romantic lead opposite a young woman. He managed to handle that problem admirably by assuming the father role.
For those who like Woody Allen films, therefore, I can recommend this for a pleasant, though not WOW!, 96 minutes. The less devoted viewer should find it an amusing offering. Those who have no taste for An Allen picture, though they like some of his award winning ones,  might just want to pass this one by.",1413849600,,2126,4.399491094147582
2663173,4,B000IU37SO,"Another Allen film that was generally dismissed by critics, but for me was worth seeing.  Certainly its hard to argue that this is up there with Allens best work, but it still has a lot of funny bits, and Allen and Scarlett Johansson have a great on-screen rapport as a young aspiring journalist and a slightly pathetic aging magician who team up to try and solve a murder case.

The two Americans have to fake their way into the snooty upper-class world of London, to chase the young aristocrat who a ghostly Ian McShane (a great reporter who died, but got a tip crossing the river Styx, and came back to tell someone) has informed them committed a series of murders.  Allen is very funny in these scenes as he tries to blend in with the lords and ladies, and Hugh Jackman does an excellent job as the suave, likable  is he or isn't he object of their investigations, who, naturally Johannson falls for.

There are weaknesses; some logic problems with the mystery, and a pay-off thats less than one might hope.  But this does a nice job of capturing some of the feel of a witty 1930s comedy. While no masterpiece, if almost anyone else had made this film, it might well have gotten praise as an enjoyable, well made romantic comedy thriller.  It just doesnt quite stand up when compared to the heights Allen is capable of.",1413158400,,1323,4.510460251046025

The selling point of this film would be Allen reviving his classic neurotic character kvetching and whining until the cows come home.  Some may collectively yawn but I found the return of this nebbish a welcome relief.  Allen's spouts out familiar one liners that are vintage but when delivered in his inimitable style feel fresh.  Only debit is the obvious gags about British culture.  The relationship between Allen and Scarlett Johansson has a refreshing Bob Hope-Brooke Shields feel to it.

But then Sondra starts to fall for Peter ...

I rather liked and enjoyed this film.  However, it is only fair to say that I consider most of Woody's films to be abominations, so my tastes are unlikely to match those of fans.  If you are a fan, you might want to check out other reviews (where you may read sentiments such as ""a disappointment after the brilliant MATCH POINT"").

VAGUE SPOILERS FOLLOW

 In Sidney Waterman, Woody plays a character who (thank God) is not quite your standard Woody-played character.  He is not (thank God) Sondra's love interest, and his role usually seems to be that of a fellow who has taken a paternal, benevolent and platonic interest in her wellbeing.  The old persona, however, resurfaces too often.  Sidney's whining and self-absorbtion are excessive to the point where they conflict with his role in the story, causing to viewer to wonder why Sydney is agreeing to help Sondra, why Sondra puts up with Sydney, and how such a person could become sufficiently self-sacrificing and risk-taking to fulfill his role in the plot.  When Sidney declares that he was raised Jewish but converted to Narcissism, it is not funny - just a sad-but-true statement about Woody himself that does not quite fit the role he is playing.

One scene - the ""don't tickle me"" scene - occurs early in the film when Sidney first meets Sondra.  It is creepy in part for the hint that Sidney was secretly groping Sondra with those fast ""nervous"" hands of his, but mainly because of the result when she tells him to stop.  The whole message of the scene seems to be ""If you tell on me, no-one will care and everyone will laugh.""  It has nothing to do with the rest of the film, and one cannot help wondering what it is about and who it is addressed to.

The theme of blackmail or whistle-blowing as a motive for murder resurfaces here, as it has in many prior Woody films, and for once (thank God) the film does not seem to take the side of the killer.  I could not help noticing, though, that the villain's downfall was not that he targeted the blackmailer, but that he unnecessarily and stupidly targeted someone completely loyal to him.  This is not really a complaint about the movie -- just an observation.",1392508800,,2606,4.779017857142857
2663187,3,B000IU37SO,"Good movie, cast is great with the exception of Woody Allen, too much Woody, and his mental problems.  Kinda of a waste of time for Hugh Jackman, who along with Scarlett rise above the material.  Very few surprises.",1389312000,,215,4.631578947368421
2663188,4,B000IU37SO,"Many of Woody Allen's movies are among my favorites, but some (like ""Vicki Christina Barcelona"")...not so much. I didn't know what ""Scoop"" was about at all--if it would be one of the ""good-but-not-always-funny"" ones or not-- and just took a chance on it on a rainy day.

So glad I did! It's charming and fun with Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johanson excellent as the romantic leads (particularly as she starts to suspect--based on a tip from a ghost--that he might be The Tarot Card Killer). The part with the ghost (Ian McShane, another really good actor) added a whimsical surreal touch to an (almost) old style murder mystery with Johanson and her (fake) father in the role of Nick and Nora Charles (well, amateur detectives, at any rate).

I enjoyed Allen's comic acting and the funny connections to his magic act (lame though it was) that moved the plot along--as well as the London scenery and Jackman's opulent lifestyle.

I was a bit bothered by Woody's acting in this movie and perhaps he WAS trying to play an awkward little old Jewish man who couldn't act, but he did it looking like he was an awkward little old Jewish man who couldn't act.  Scarlett's acting was a bit off, too.  She was great in Woody's Barcelona movie but here, she was amateurish.  She didn't convince me of not trying to act.  The acting was what bothered me.  Perhaps two other actors would have had better ownership of their roles and made the movie flow better.

2663208,3,B000IU37SO,"I recently saw Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris and liked it very much.  That inspired me to check out some of his other recent films.  The plot of Scoop sounded good and I like both Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson.  Unfortunately, this film is a bit of a misfire.  The basic idea is excellent:  A dead newspaper reporter has information that a wealthy member of the British aristocracy may be a serial killer.  The reporter escapes from a boat crossing the river Styx long enough to tell a third-rate magician (Allen) and a college student (Johansson) about it.  The execution of this idea is lacking, however.  To begin with, the casting here is a bit off.  I can understand that Allen still wants to appear occasionally in his movies, but he really looks both old and worn out.  I think it would have made more sense to have cast a younger actor in the role, someone who might have been a plausible love interest for Johansson.  Johansson is also a bit miscast as a college student.  I understand her star power, but given her age and the number of films she has been in, casting her as a 20-year old is iffy at best.

The plot could also have been better:  Having the dead reporter make only a handful of appearances and then to say things that aren't very funny and don't advance the plot much seemed to be making poor use of a good idea.  Finally, this is meant to be a comedy, but a fair number of the jokes fall flat and most of the rest are good for a smile at best.  The dialogue is not nearly at the level of some of Allen's better films, including Midnight in Paris.

Allen has cranked out an enormous number of films.  I think he has been on a pace of about one film per year.  I don't know of another director in modern Hollywood who comes close to matching that output.  Because he is writing the scripts -- by himself in recent years -- and directing and (sometimes) acting, he must be under enormous strain.  If he had more time, I think films like Scoop could have been much better.  Granted, he hit a home run with Midnight in Paris, but for ever home run, he has had several strike outs.  In fact, if he hadn't had so many flops, Midnight in Paris would probably have been booked in more theaters and would have the potential to be a major hit.

So, while this film was certainly watchable -- I didn't find myself fast forwarding through it like another reviewer did -- it was definitely a disappointment.  I would recommend it only to die-hard Woody Allen fans.",1310860800,,2485,4.373362445414847

The main characters are flat, stereotypical, and lack development throughout the entire film.  The dialog is stale and there's virtually no chemistry between Johansson and Jackman.  Allen tries to take a comedic lead in this, and while his scenes with Johansson are palatable, any of the scenes where he ""takes the stage"" are cringe-worthy.

I personally had such high hopes for this film, and think it's about time that Hollywood stopped remaking classics that have nothing wrong with them, and instead re-package films like this that could be memorable and fall completely short.  Johansson and Jackmen are great actors and I felt that with some better material that they could've at least made this something worth watching more than once on a dare.",1293840000,,950,5.096774193548387

2663212,4,B000IU37SO,"""Scoop"" is a mystery/comedy/romance written and directed by Woody Allen and released in 2006. Scarlett Johansson stars as Sondra Pransky, a geeky college journalist vacationing in England. She gets a tip from the ghost of a dead newsman (Ian McShane) on the identity of a local serial killer and proceeds to team up with bumbling magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen); the tip leads them to the rich son of a prominent lord, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), with whom Sondra unintentionally starts to fall in love. Is Lyman the notorious killer or isn't he?

Although fantastical and somewhat goofy, ""Scoop"" is first and foremost a mystery and I did enjoy trying to figure out if Peter Lyman is the ""Tarot Card killer."" In the story we perceive Peter Lyman largely through the lens of Sondra, who is falling in love with the guy; hence, the viewer warms up to him and doesn't want him to be a notorious killer.

""Scoop"" is a comedy but not in the laugh-out-loud sense of, say, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective""; it's mildly amusing, witty and fun but generally not knee-slapping funny, so if you're looking for the latter don't bother.

The three stars and their chemistry are a highlight. I enjoyed the team-up of Woody (Sid) & Scarlett (Sondra) and their surrogate father/daughter relationship. I knew when I saw ""The Horse Whisperer"" that Scarlett would grow up to be one of cinema's leading beauties, and so she is! Scarlett was 21 while filming ""Scoop"" and plays against type; and she does it quite well. The film is worth catching solely for her, just don't expect any raunch or t&a exploitation (although she does have a one-piece bathing suit scene and a nightie scene, which are both rather modest).

Hugh Jackman is a great modern masculine actor, of course, and he does fine here, although I couldn't help wondering if long metal claws would suddenly shoot out of his knuckles!

The London and English countryside locations are nice eyecandy.

The runtime is 96 minutes.

FINAL WORD: This is my first Woody Allen film so I'm not familiar with his rpertoire and therefore can't compare ""Scoop"" with his other movies. With this in mind, ""Scoop"" is an enjoyable mystery/comedy highlighted by refreshing originality, a good cast with good chemistry and English locations. I admit that I didn't think I'd like the film during the first 25 minutes or so (I also admit that I mainly bought it for Scarlett Johnansson, who doesn't disappoint), but then I ""caught a grip"" on the vibe of the movie. The interactions between the three main characters, their story and the mounting mystery pulled me in and glued me until the end. I also enjoyed the creative zany elements (e.g. crossing the River Styx with the Grim Reaper and the reappearing ghost reporter) and the film's overall refreshing air.

In fact, for some strange reason I love ""Scoop"".

I watched it last night and almost turned off the movie halfway into it. Scarlett Johansson turns in possibly her worst performance. She is not a great actress by any means. But in this role she came across like an actor in her first college play. She is exposed as being very amateurish; it was embarrassing and somewhat uncomfortable to watch. Especially when contrasted with many of the seasoned and refined British (and Australian, in the case of Jackman) actors with whom she had scenes.

Woody Allen also decided to step out in front of the camera this time, in contrast to Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona. He shouldn't have. His performance is anachronistic. And his stuttering, neurotic persona, which may have worked in the '70s, comes across as sad, lame and entirely out of place. At times the stuttering was so bad that it seemed either he forgot his lines or age had morphed his stammer into a pathological condition.

Again, I love Woody's new direction but you can skip Scoop.",1240272000,,1163,4.747524752475248

2663227,4,B000IU37SO,"I found ""Scoop"" to be a very charming, amusing movie that simultaneously (and ingeniously) combines elements of comedy, suspense, and maturity of script and plot. This is a great film in the tradition of Woody Allen and an excellent way for a new generation to be introduced to his movies.

Scarlett Johanssen plays Sondra Pransky, a college student who pursues a career in journalism after foregoing her former ambition of becoming a dental hygienist. The movie contains a good deal of well-placed comments having to do with teeth and dental hygiene, which I personally found very cute and original (I mean, who doesn't like quirky comments about teeth)? She goes to a magic show where the great ""Splendini"" (Allen) has her help him with a magic trick. She enters a box where she encounters a deceased reporter who gives her a scoop on a well-to-do British man, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). The deceased reporter indicates that he believes Lyman to be the ""Tarot card killer.""

Sondra talks the great ""Splendini"" / Sid Waterman into helping her investigate Lyman, but in the process falls in love with him, and even though there is some mounting evidence against him, neither believes he is the killer. Hugh Jackman, I must say, is very charming in this movie. I would not believe that this adorable man with a British accent would be capable of killing anyone either. Of course, you must watch the movie yourself to find out whether this debonair man is a killer or not!

I therefore highly recommend this movie. You will be in suspense and second-guessing right up until the end. You really can't go wrong with a Woody Allen movie. Have a great day, everyone!

2663228,5,B000IU37SO,"OK, I'll go out on a limb here and say that this is Woody Allen's greatest film since Crimes and Misdemeanors. I have watched it multiple times and believe that its seeming superficiality is intentional. The Scoop in the title is meant to underscore that this film is meant to be as light as a serving of ice cream. It's intended as a treat. I'll even go further and say that this film completes a thematic arc Woody began with Melinda & Melinda, in which competing filmmakers sit around and argue about how to make the same story as either a tragedy or a comedy. Woody himself then went on to make two London-based films about social class and murder, one serious (Match Point) and one trivial (Scoop). It's a reminder that Woody, churning out one film a year, is also a great artist who is developing and reconsidering themes over the course of his ouevre. So, yes, Scoop reminds one of Manhattan Murder Mystery (a funny and underrated Woody film as well), but also betters it, revisiting some of Woody's favourite themes (death, artifice) with a fantastically light touch. This movie seems dumb but isn't, which is part of what tickles me about it. I watch it over and over, and my brain just hums with delight. It's one of the most relaxing DVDs I own. On every level, it works: Scarlett Johansson is the best actress he's found since Diane at delivering his dialogue naturally and easily, and at making it funny, and she looks both fantastic and a little dorky. She's just perfect. And Woody has written himself one of his greatest parts in years as a showbiz hack whose constant riffing on the action is screamingly funny. Last but not least, the film looks fabulous, with lovely photography and production design, so Woody's hit all his marks. Don't be scared away by the negative reviewers.

I totally agree with some of the other reviews, which indicated disappointment in Woody Allen's using the same old shtick for his own character.  But I was also disappointed in Scarlett Johansen's portrayal, as I found it flat and almost uncomfortable.

2663231,4,B000IU37SO,"Even third rate Allen is a few notches funnier than the best dreck Hollywood offers, and all Allen films get better with successive viewings. This tale- a bit over an hour and a half, uses several key themes in the Allen canon- sex, deceit, lies, murder, and magic, and also has much in common with 1993's underrated Manhattan Murder Mystery, his terrific 1984 film, Broadway Danny Rose- perhaps his best straight comedy, and some of 1989's Oedipus Wrecks- from the New York Stories trilogy film Allen did with Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a college student in England who is studying journalism. She is selected out of the audience by the Great Splendini (Allen), whose real name is Sid Waterman. What works well is that Johansson is a very good comedienne, and much more believable in this role than her role as the bitchy siren in Match Point. Unlike many other Woody persona stand-ins of the last twenty years, she handles his humor without aping the Woody persona (see John Cusack in Bullets Over Broadway, Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity, or Will Ferrell in Melinda And Melinda), and may be the best Allen comedienne after Diane Keaton.... So, when you read negative reviews of this film, which might compare it to some of his decidedly lighter weight comedies like Small Time Crooks (which was still funnier than a Wayans family film), do not believe it. Scoop is a good movie- a very good movie, and in her second pairing with Allen, Scarlett Johansson proves that while she may never be the sex symbol/screen siren type in the Angelina Jolie/Halle Berry/Catherine Zeta-Jones mold, she can do comedy the way none of them can. And, since few have ever done comedy equal to or better than Allen, I predict an Oscar for her in the very near future- and, for a change, she may be the rare starlet who'll deserve such kudos.
  As for Allen? Now with his Woody persona killed, one can only hope that the behind the scenes Allen will concentrate more on screenplays in the Match Point vein, and produce a few latter-day gems to bookend such Golden Era fare as Stardust Memories, Radio Days, and Crimes And Misdemeanors. And if Johansson is in a few, so much the better, for an Annie Hall for a younger generation could never be considered a bad thing.",1221609600,,2294,4.7325
2663232,5,B000IU37SO,"It is certainly hard to believe that Woody Allen has been creating films for over a generation - the mind boggles at the extent of his entire body of work. There isn't a filmmaker out there one could say has hit the mark every time, and Allen isn't an exception. His last serious film, Match Point, had mixed reviews as most of Allen's non-comedic films do, however the dialogue was truly excellent and the ending quite ruthless. In a word, one of his latest projects, Scoop, is a gem. The jokes are non-stop which had my friend and I (who isn't an Allen fan) laughing out loud from beginning to end.

It has been said and written many times before that you are either a Woody Allen fan or not...this may be true, though Scoop could just well make a few converts because the film is light, very funny with an entertaining plot, where one can sit back and have a good time without having to think too much.

Scarlett Johansson does an excellent job as the 'student' reporter, called upon by a dead newsman to investigate one of London's most notorious serial killers, the ""Tarot Card Killer"". Scarlett revealed in this film that she is a good, if not great, comedic actor; between Allen and her, each scene gets better and better. Their exchange of lines runs fast (sometimes in staccato fashion) and you have to pay attention to catch the various subtlties - comedy is all about timing, and their timing was close to perfect.

Hugh Jackman (Peter Lyman) as the English aristocrat, was played with charm, and the actor has shown his fans that he can play just about anything he puts his mind to - a great actor.

The ending of the story tied it all up: surprising, funny with a subtle twist.

Scoop is Woody Allen going back to basics - witty and hilarious.

A firm five stars.",1221523200,3,1776,4.4829721362229105
2663233,3,B000IU37SO,"I will attest to the fact that I did not expect anything more than a passing good time walking into `Scoop', although I was hoping for more.  I got what I expected and so for that I am thankful.  Regardless of the bad reviews it received upon it's release, `Scoop' has a lot going for it (not the least of which is Johansson's comedic timing) and while it does not stack up to Allen's previous `Match Point' (how anyone can say that `Match Point' is overrated is beyond me when it's lack of a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars proves it is nothing short of underrated) it offers the audience a fun and quirky good time.

The film follows young aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky who winds up getting the tip of a lifetime from the deceased reporter Joe Strombel while attending a magic show starring the Great Splendini (also known as Sid Waterman).  The dead Strombel proceeds to tell Pransky that a young politician named Peter Lyman may in fact be the feared tarot card serial killer.  This proves to be the big break that Pransky was waiting for, and so with Waterman in toe she proceeds to infiltrate Lyman's life in order to uncover the truth, a truth that becomes more and more difficult for her to see once her infatuation for Lyman starts to blind her better judgment.

`Scoop' suffers in one key area, and that is plot.  In the end the film feels incomplete, like half a movie.  You leave feeling as if Woody forgot a big chuck of the film on the cutting room floor.  The script work, dialog wise, for the most part is pretty strong, but the plot holes ware on the viewer as the film draws to a close.

What it lacks in plot development it makes up for in the sublime casting choices.  Hugh Jackman is superb as Peter Lyman.  He is charming and debonair and extremely handsome (maybe more so than he's ever been since I've never thought him attractive, but he pulls it off here).  His portrayal of Lyman is spot on, making it easy to see why Pransky is falling so hard for him.  Better still is the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Sondra.  Johnasson is proving one film at a time that she has the chops to handle a film all her own, and here she expands her talent to cover comedy as well.  Her bantering with Woody is flawless, and she matches his wit step for step, frame for frame; in fact she out-wits him many times, handling her dialog with crisper, funnier delivery.  Woody Allen works most of the time, but as the film continues onward his character borders on annoying (that whole ""I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I love you, you're a beautiful person"" bit gets old fast).

While Ian McShane does not give a bad performance, I will say that his character is the biggest plot hole.  A film that hinges on a tip given by a ghost you would think would make that ghost seem important or vital but in the end his character is very throwaway and could have ultimately been left out.

Woody needs to work on that.

In then end I will say that `Scoop' met my expectations.  It did not exceed them, but then again not every movie needs to do that.  Scarlett is a revelation as Sondra, funny and witty and charming and she proves that she does not need to rely on her sensuality to sell a film for she tones herself down drastically and plays Pronsky with just as much ease and comfort as she did Nola Rice.  The dialog is sharp (for the most part) and the pacing is brisk, it just suffers from being too light in the end, losing some of its depth in the holes throughout the plot.

If you want a satisfying comedy than `Scoop' may just do the trick, but if you want a more intelligent and tightly woven film then look at Allen's previous effort `Match Point' (or even the tragically under seen `Melinda and Melinda').",1219622400,,3741,4.371387283236994
2663234,2,B000IU37SO,"As a filmmaker, Woody Allen has been in steady decline for 15 years or more. Scoop is not the worst of his latter day movies, but assuredly it is one that will not stand tall among his other productions. At first I hoped it was based on Evelyn Waugh's book of the same title but I soon discovered that it bore no relation to that masterful work. The performances here are acceptable, but the plot itself is weak and features a rather goofy ending (in my view). Hugh Jackman's bad guy was a bit of a stretch, but that's nothing in comparison to Allen's casting of Scarlett Johansson as a mousy college reporter. In no way is she believable in that role. Of course, this is not her fault; it's the director's. Why Woody Allen continues to take the most sought after actors of our day and turn them into androgynous versions of himself for 90 minutes is beyond my reckoning. I've seen it happen many times in the past and he should really allow his characters to drop their neuroses and become people independent of the auteur. Furthermore, Allen's Sid Waterman is a dicey endeavor. He plays Johansson's supposed dad although granddad would be more appropriate. The film would have been better without his character and the jokes he made fell flat. I found his portrayal of England's social structure to be about five decades behind the times. Overall, Scoop is stale and forgettable. This movie will only greatly appeal to those fans who think Woody can do no wrong.",1219104000,2,1464,4.6130268199233715

No, that's not entirely accurate. The production, being set in England, was at least decent to look at.

Take a hint from the cheap looking cover art (that was my first clue but I ignored it) and AVOID this film. There is absolutely ZERO tact, subtlety, and entertainment value. I don't know what movie these other people watched that gave it 3+ stars, because rating it at 1-star is being generous for me.

2663239,4,B000IU37SO,"Frankly, for me Woody Allen had become as pleasure long past his sell by date.  However, I happened to catch this movie when flipping around and watched the rest of it and then caught the whole film at a later viewing.  I liked it!  No, it isn't a great film, but it is a delightful light entertainment.

Scarlett Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young, somewhat ditzy but earnest reporter for her college newspaper.  She is in London visiting a wealth upper crust friend and staying with her family.  We also learn that she has (as Woody Allen's character notes later) a problem with promiscuity.  For example, when trying to get an interview with a big time movie producer who has no intention of telling her anything, all she comes away with is a hangover and an embarrassing story of being outwitted.

We also get to see a barge load of souls headed to the land of the departed engaging in the kind of idle conversation you might expect from the newly dead.  A secretary tells a reporter that she knows who the Tarot Card Killer is.  The reporter, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) asks her how she would know that.  She says that she noticed something about her boss's cufflinks and told someone about it over the phone, but she had hear a click on the line and suspected someone was listening.  She notes that she was dead by that afternoon and suspected poison.  Her boss is the millionaire son of a Lord, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) and Strombel is determined to not let such a story pass and slips off the barge to swim back towards the land of the living.

While attending a magic show by ""The Great Splendini"", Sondra gets selected to enter the ""dematerializer"" so she will disappear and then reappear as her molecules are agitated.  While she is in the box, Strombel materializes and tells her that he knows she is a reporter and gives her the gist of the story before he is taken back.  Sondra is confused, but does a web search of the key elements, goes back to tell the rightly skeptical Splendini (Woody Allen) and wants to get back in his box.  Splendini lets her do it, but notes that he is really just Sid Waterman and he built the ""dematerializer"" and it is just plywood.  Nothing happens while she is in the box, but after she steps out Strombel appears in a way that she and Sid can see and hear.  Sid wants no part of it, but is drawn in.  Sondra is convinced of Lyman's guilt and Sid is equally convinced of his innocence.

The rest of the story is how Sid and Sondra try to determine what is real and what is false about the story.  Strombel makes a couple more short appearances to help a bit, but Sondra is also falling for the handsome and sensitive Peter Lyman and no longer believes he is the bad guy while Sid has flipped to becoming convinced of his guild.

Who is right, who is wrong, and how the story ends you should watch this charming little tale to find out.  The dialogue has some with, charm, and the plot has a couple of nice twists along the way.

2663241,3,B000IU37SO,"""I have a mixed feeling about ""Scoop,"" Woody Allen's contemporary comedy set in London. On the one hand the comedy has very funny moments and provides several nice twists in the story. The performances of the actors are largely good with Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman, plus cameos of respected British veterans like Charles Dance and John Sanding. And you just can't complain about Ms. Johansson in a swimming suit.

On the other hand, however, I couldn't shake off the feeling of ""I have seen this before"" while watching ""Scoop"" which is about Johansson's character American journalism student trying to get a scoop on the serial killer, with Woody Allen's magician in tow. I'm talking about ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" and OK, I know, ""Scoop"" opens differently, with the ghost of recently deceased journalist (Ian McShane) coming back to our world in a hilarious way. Hugh Jackman is also great with menace hidden in his eye, as a billionaire's son and possible murderer of the recent serial killings.

But I seriously miss Diane Keaton and her perfect comic timing that easily made the annoying and officious wife in ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" so endearing. The comparison may not be fair (after all Diane Keaton was, and is, a close friend to Allen), but still I must say something seems missing between Johansson's college student and Allen's nervous magician. Maybe Scarlett Johansson, talented as she is, is too young and beautiful to be delightfully nerdy, reckless and meddling; or maybe Allen is relying too much on his old tricks, his ultra-nervous fast mumbling; or it's just lack of chemistry.

""Scoop"" is a light comedy that delivers laughs. It's not his best, just average, but his average is still above the standard for most of other directors.",1200009600,,1766,5.020477815699659

2663245,4,B000IU37SO,"This version of ""Scoop"", which you won't confuse with the Herbert Lom version from many years ago, is a comic delight that mixes romance, murder, humor and mystery in a nicely-packaged production. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Ian McShane and hunky Hugh Jackman.

Johansson goes against her femme fatale and/or wounded woman type as a college journalims student sleuthing the story of a serial murderer in London. Allen plays his signature comic role as a magician that forges a relationship with Johannson and aids her sleuthery. His script is essentially one liners with his unique spontaneity, as always, some of which leave you laughing while others merely amuse you. McShane, whom you may have seen in HBO's ""Deadwood"", is, ironically, a dead reporter that appears as a ghost from time to time to clue in the pair on how to solve the case. Jackman plays a hunky Brit of royal heritage that woos Johansson during her investigation and plays another role in the overall story.

This film moves quickly and breezily from scene to scene, never meandering or going into tangents, and always going forward in sprightly comic style. Its English scenery, including the neighborhood surrounding London's majestic Royal Albert Hall, where one of the murders takes place, add a lot to the film's aura.

The storyline is weak and cliche-ridden and nothing outside the comic elements of the script does anything to change this. But what most works most against this film is its predictability. There comes a point in the movie where Johansson and ""father"" Allen -- she at one point passes him off as her father -- have used tips and evidence to pin the murders on the obvious perp...but along comes another guy that confesses to them. It's clear to anyone with ears, eyes and a brain that's ever seen one of these movies what's going to transpire in the next 30 minutes and it all transpires just as you'd imagine.

Still, this is an enjoyable foray for an evening that will leave comedy fans feeling good when it's concluded...even if you can't remember anything that went on in the story. My greatest enjoyment was seeing Johansson play comedy, something I'd not seen before from this wonderful actress. She is a remarkably effective foil to Allen's consistently humorous one liners and their scenes together are the best part of this movie. Women will no doubt enjoy the various scenes of Jackman as he romances the female lead.

In the final analysis, this effective comedy transcends mundane material through the magnetism of its stars and the chemistry Johansson and Allen create in their scenes, where they are uniformly wonderful. While hardly a great film with almost no intellectual value, ""Scoop"" is marvelously entertaining and is one of the swiftest-moving comedies I've seen since ""Love Stinks.""

The movie has one of Allen's most outlandish premises since the early seventies.  An American journalism student is a volunteer in a magic show (Allen plays the magician).  During the trick she's contacted by the ghost of a recently deceased newspaper reporter who wants the girl to help him scoop one last headline.

Allen has always made some lighthearted films in between his more serious efforts.  The problem is that this one often feels like a rehash of ""Manhattan Murder Mystery.""  Another problem is that Scarlett Johansson might be a lot prettier than Diane Keaton, but she doesn't come close to replicating Keaton's girlish charm or comic timing.  She seems overwhelmed in this role.  In my opinion she needs to stick with movies like ""Lost in Translation,"" that call for a more low key performance.

The movie isn't without it's moments.  Allen does a great job of playing himself, acting as a bumbling sidekick while Johansson gets herself into a few sticky situations.  There are a few twists and turns so that the ending isn't predictable--it's just the plot isn't entirely original, either, and the execution leaves something to be desired.",1174521600,4,1379,4.817021276595745

Although the camera absolutely adores her in 'Scoop', I thought her acting was also pretty good and it was not her performance which diappointed me, but that of Woody Allen, who abandons his usual laconic, self-deprecating persona in favour of some almost slapstick schtick.

Alas, Allen fails completely to build any sort of tension in the mystery aspect of his story, though he hits the bullseye in the comedic scenes with himself and Johanssen (who is the perfect foil for him).

Hugh Jackman, who is one of the best actors working today, has virtually nothing to do. Is he a serial killer? Is he simply a charming, intelligent, strikingly handsome member of the upper class? Is he both? We know almost nothing about him, even by the end of the film.

It would have been far better had Jackman been cast not as a potential serial killer, but as Johanssen's love interest, working WITH her to attempt to determine whether or not a certain lord's son is a murderer. Had Jackman's character been, say, a friend or acquaintance of the suspect, the film would have been much stronger. He, Johanssen, and Allen would have made a fine comedic trio. Instead, we have a poorly outlined character for Jackman, who deserves much better. And a plot that's full of holes.

As it is, watch the film for Jackman's charm and the comic scenes with the other two leads.",1171497600,2,1171,4.5933014354066986

2663289,4,B000IU37SO,"I saw ""Scoop"" in the theater when it was released and I liked it a lot but I am a Woody's addict, I need to get my fix and I'd be fine until he releases the next movie. I love him, I love his work but my love is not blind. I see that his new film is not original, it is not even secondary. He seems to read and re-read Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" lately and he uses the certain scenes and plot devices of the novel in his London period consistently and constantly. He uses the familiar elements of at least three his own earlier movies (but as he said himself - ""if you have to steal, steal from the best"") - I will not reveal them - there is a murder mystery after all :). Allen's rather sizable presence in the movie as the magician Sidney Waterman who reluctantly agrees to help an American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlet Johansson) to investigate a big story involving a young and attractive aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) who may or may not be a notorious serial killer known as ""Tarot Card Serial Killer"" could be seen as blessing or the failure. For those of us who love Woody not only behind the camera but in front of it, it is certainly the former. I personally was happy to see Allen playing once again the same role he's be doing so well for many years. I loved his one-liners, his physical comedy which is still good even if he looks his age and does not hide it. My love does not stop me from noticing the holes in plot so big that Woody's cute little ""Smart"" could've easily fell in one of them or from admitting that getting crucial information pertaining to investigation from a ghost is not the most elegant plot device but as I mentioned in the summary, ""love means never having to say you're sorry"". I am not sorry that I've seen ""Scoop"" in the theater with Allen's fans that laughed and had fun all along. For these who are not as hard core admirer as I am - here is a DVD.",1170115200,2,1926,4.2506811989100814
2663290,3,B000IU37SO,"If you were a newspaper reporter how far would you go for the headline of your life? Excuse me, to be more accurate, for the headline of your death. In the case of one hard nosed, recently deceased reporter named Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) the possible discovery of a murderer's identity facilitates multiple escape attempts from the Grim Reaper as he journey's across the River Styx.

When the identity of the would-be murderer is supernaturally revealed to Sondra (Scarlett Johansson) during a second rate magic act performed by the great Splendini (Woody Allen) the young college student and journalism major decides to follow the clues provided by the disembodied Strombel and bring the killer to justice.

`Scoop' released in '06 is the latest Woody Allen film boasting a strong cast and excellent production values in this somewhat convoluted comedy/romance/murder mystery. You would think that such a fine cast matched with the comedic writing talent and direction of the legendary Woody Allen this would be a film not to be missed. Unfortunately the only mystery about this movie is why it doesn't deliver the entertainment value one would expect from such a talented ensemble. Something seems to be missing and I just can't quite put my finger on it. It has it brief moments here and there but when the credits finally rolled by I was glad it was over.",1169942400,,1361,4.93886462882096
2663291,4,B000IU37SO,"I'm surprised at the number of people who have trashed ""Scoop"", because I can be rather critical and yet I enjoyed this one. The trouble with evaluating Woody Allen movies is that each film begs comparison to every other one, rather than being permitted a fresh start to stand on its own merits. And Allen fans will seek out his work, while naysayers will avoid it, thereby ruling out the need to critique his movies in the first place, I suppose.

So I'll try to steer away from those pitfalls and just contribute my two cents by stating that ""Scoop"" contains enough wit and fun to be engaging entertainment. Sure, the plot revolving around a ""Tarot card killer"" was somewhat underdeveloped, as was the character of Hugh Jackman, as Peter Lymon. But never mind that - if the mystery/thriller genre is your thing, perhaps you shouldn't be choosing Woody Allen films; that's not really what he's about; DUH. In this case the ""plot"" is just a ruse to showcase the humor in unlikely situations, such as a young journalism student and a magician of recent acquaintance masquerading as father/daughter after she receives an invite to a posh estate. Here Allen as the magician/faux parent gets an opportunity to make us laugh, without being hopelessly crude or juvenile, and that's what it's all about, my friend.

Also worth a mention is the way death is depicted early on in ""Scoop"", giving me a strong intuitive sense that I was in for a treat. HA - let THAT be the mystery for you!",1169856000,,1479,4.662835249042145

Although watching woody's movies is often like experiencing deja vu, what great artist isn't guilty of repetition, we are always glad to return to the comfortable world of intelligent wit and homage to cinema that he has created over the years..

scoop is, if i am not mistaken, woody's second film to take place in great britain - along with the equally charming 'match point'. Allen's comedy translates, surprisingly, well to the city of london..

while we may yawn at the reccurence of themes in his movies and his occasional self-indulgence- as usual he is pitch perfect in his delivery.",1169769600,,658,5.027522935779817
2663293,4,B000IU37SO,"Another from Woody's recent ""English"" period, shot in London with some solid local thespian support, this is an enjoyable and unpretentious film which contains some cracking Allen gags along the way. The Scoop of the title is a tip-off that journalist Scarlett Johansson receives from the ghost of a dead hack about the possible identity of a serial killer, which she then pursues with the help of stage magician Allen. A couple of scenes fall a little flat, as do a couple of Allen's one-liners, but there are plenty of good ones to make up for it. Of course, it's a must for Allen fans, but others may be pleasantly surprised.

PS  I would ideally rate this at 3.5 stars, but as this is not possible I've upped it to 4 rather than underrating it.",1169078400,,748,4.533333333333333

Well, if you thought Match Point was his shedding of comedic genre (yeah, sure) then get Scoop and lighten up.

I laughed loud, chuckled as Woody got back into his vaudevillian homage, a la Danny Rose.

We are also graced to watch Scarlett as his perfect foil. She is not quite the Carole Lombard but she is gorgeous and Allen's lines are funny exiting her lips.

2663296,3,B000IU37SO,"This is good Woody Allen fun...not a thinking picture...nor one of his

comedy highlights.  I vastly preferred his Manhattan Murder Mystery...which takes place in New York City, of course.  Woody has not yet gotten the hang of London, where this movie is filmed.  The beginning is interesting though with its mythical reference to dead souls traveling down the River Styx.  And the idea that a top-notch journalist (who just died) is stuck with giving his ""scoop"" of the identity of the notorious Tarot Card Murderer to a totally inexperienced college journalism student is a nice touch.  Indeed, all the characters take to their roles with aplomb, but the plot is simply too formulaic.  Some good jokes from Woody Allen sparked the film.  For example, Woody tells a rich British crowd that he bought his first Rubens with poker winnings.  ""Wow, you own a Rubens painting?""  ""No, a Reubens sandwich.""  But that's a New York joke.  When you want to view something entertaining but not intellectual,  this might just fit the bill.",1168128000,5,1028,4.941520467836257
2663307,2,B000IU37SO,"'Match Point' was Woody Allen's best film since 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'.  It had an intriguing and involving plot, a great performance from Scarlett Johansson, and it was refreshing for Mr. Allen to shift the focus from Manhattan to London.  I loved the film.  By contrast, 'Scoop' is light and lazy.  Hugh Jackman is completely wasted, and the murder theory is undeveloped. Woody returns playing his neurotic self in a typical role that he is now too old for, and a bespectaled Scarlett Johansson playing private eye just isn't very believable.  As mentioned, the script has many holes in it that Woody was too lazy to fix and the entire project has a rushed and unedited feel to it.  It brings to mind the scenes in 'Ed Wood' where Johnny Depp is directing 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and after each scene, no matter how good it is, he yells ""Cut! And print!!"".

Woody needs to start issuing a film every two-to-three years instead of every year.  His quality output would rise substantially.  As it is, 'Scoop' is not only lightweight, but insubstantial and disappointing.  Skip it.",1168128000,4,1085,4.78494623655914

2663309,3,B000IU37SO,"This is very much minor-league Woody Allen, though it is not without its charms. Set in London the same as his previous film, ""Match Point"", this 2006 mystery comedy also shares the same upper crust ambiance and the same leading lady, the omnipresent Scarlett Johansson. However, the tone is thoroughly lightweight somewhat reminiscent of Allen's more entertaining ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" (1993), and Johansson is not an obsessive femme fatale this time but a jittery Diane Keaton doppelganger as college student and aspiring reporter Sondra Pransky. Attending a show in London with friends, Sondra gets chosen by Catskills-style magician Sid ""Splendini"" Waterman to participate in a magic trick where she disappears in a Chinese box. While in there, a ghost appears - Joe Strombel, a just-deceased journalist who has found out from a fellow spirit  that the ""Tarot Card Killer"" terrorizing young brunette women in London is likely a young old-money aristocrat named Peter Lyman.

Strombel passes the information along to Sondra, who sees this exclusive as her opportunity to make it big in professional journalism. Wrangling Sid to be her cohort, she is able to not only track down Peter but ends up falling in love with him. The inevitable consequences occur as the plot unspools to reveal who the real murderer is. My primary disappointment with the film comes from Allen's lackadaisical screenplay, an unwieldy hodgepodge of contrived Hitchcock-lite mystery elements, paper-thin characters and his endless kvetching. Even though Allen supplies a steady stream of one-liners, some quite funny, it's the lazy plotting that undermines whatever suspense he tries to generate, in particular, the build-up to the disappointing ending. Allen naturally casts himself as Sid, but he provides the character with so much tired schtick that he becomes tiresome.

Even bespectacled, Johansson is an alluring screen presence, a fact obviously not lost on Allen who wrote this script specifically for her. But she seems oddly off-kilter for most of the film, jumping back and forth between her own coolish persona and a bumptious impersonation of Allen's nervous mannerisms. The relationship of their characters never seems particularly believable, but they generate a credible rapport making their comic bantering far more entertaining than the story's romantic angle. As the erudite Lyman, Hugh Jackman cuts the requisite dashing figure, but there is little else to his suspected character, while Ian McShane makes the most of his relatively few scenes as Strombel. What works well unequivocally is the beautiful cinematography from Remi Adefarasin, who makes London and the English countryside look most inviting. As usual for Allen's films, the DVD contains no extras, not even the trailer.",1167436800,3,2786,5.414746543778802

 The worst part is that allen got the hot Scarlett Johansson to basically be him - his only direction to her must have been, ""uh yeah uh yeah yeah uh uh uh BE JUST LIKE ME!  RAMBLE ON LIKE AN IDIOT AND MAKE CHEESY ONE LINER JOKES THAT ARENT FUNNY! YEAH THATS IT!""

But I just had to give it a try...and it was well worth it. It reminded me of Foul Play with Goldie Hawn. It doesn't take itself too seriously but it is full of suspense. Scareltt is very witty and charming and completely believable as a college student on the scoop of her life.

Scarlett plays a young woman who while spending some time with a friend goes to a magican's show run by Woody Allen. While in a box on stage a spirit of a deceased reporter materializes and tells her that Peter Lyman may be the Tarot card killer. What's any reporter to do? While the most reporting Scarlet has done is try to get an interview with a director, and subsequently sleeping with him after he gets her drunk, she jumps at  the oppurtunity and wants to get the story.

What follows is hysterical. Shw tails the mysterious subject, Peter, only to find out that it is not Peter at all. Back to square one. She fakes a drowning to draw his attention out at a posh swimming club so they can meet. But while she continues to investigate Peter she finds herself falling in love. Clever, witty, and moves at a fast pace. Great contribution by Woody Allen and Scarlett, as this role was written specifically for her after their work together in Match Point.

There was one major problem in the plot.  How come the combination worked . . . wasn't that pretty much proof of the entire premise of the story.  And it was never mentioned.

All in all, it was predictable as far as Hugh Jackman's character was concerned, and I was glad when the movie was over.  Woody should stick to New York, or at least to the USA.",1166572800,,610,4.644859813084112
2663313,4,B000IU37SO,"I liked Match Point, but I haven't liked a Woody Allen movie since Deconstructing Harry. Scoop feels like a re-telling of Manhattan Murder Mystery set in London, and it is somewhat light and fluffy, but there are some great, classic Woody Allen moments and lines. (""You're so negative. You always think the glass is half empty."" Allen: ""No, I think the glass is half-full, but of poison."") Woody's magician act is hilarious and kudos to him for finally playing the bumbling old man. It's a new Woody Allen we haven't seen before and it's anxiously endearing. Five years ago, he would have played the girl's lover. Here he pretends to be her father. Woody grew up and it's welcomed.

I normally don't like Hugh Jackman, but he was well-cast and he did something few people do in Woody Allen movies: he didn't act like he was in a Woody Allen movie! The movie loses a star for Scarlett Johannsen. Sorry, I just don't get it. I find her bland and a poor choice as sucessor to the Woody Allen menagerie of leading ladies.

This isn't up the level of the Woody Allen of the late 1970s or early 1980s, but it's better than the stuff he has been doing the last 10 years and just fun to watch.",1166572800,,1185,4.431192660550459

This is the second of back to back Woody movies set it England; featuring Johansson.  This movie is best described as a light and airy comedy, with a bit of murder mystery mixed in.  I am compelled to compare it to Manhatten Murder Mystery.  Therin lies the rub.  From a critic, reviewer, and [the] public's standpoint, Woody Allen is in constant competition with himself.  His body of work is phenomenal.  There are great movies and average movies.  Were Scoop to have been directed by a first time director, I wonder what type of reviews it would have received?  I tend to believe that since Woody is so polarizing, this film is held to a higher standard than most others.  I think this film falls in the 3.5 star range.  To begin with, any film with Scarlett Johannson in it is time well spent.  She is a very good actress and is very easy on the eyes.  Hugh Jackman has proven to be a very versatile actor who does a nice job in this movie, which is a bit of a change of pace for him.  The movie is about a college student from America who majors in journalism.  She is in London when she unearths (scoops) a big story.  She meets with a ghost who provides some information about a London serial killer's identity.  With Woody as her magician friend, Johannson embarks on a romance with Jackman who may or may not be involved in the killings.  This movie is a nice little way to spend a couple of hours watching a light and airy comedy, with a dash of mystery mixed in.
