551818,4,630305885X,"This is a well written story by Douglas Adams. Ward and Baker make a fine showing in this episode which seems, sadly, more interested in showing the BBC's big expense (laugh) at filming in Paris rather than developing the  story further. All in all it has a good plot and even better ending. CHEERS  - Acting, Storyline JEERS - There is no way that Cabbage head fits into the  Human mask!",951091200,,388,4.436619718309859
551819,5,630305885X,"CITY OF DEATH remains one of the few Doctor Who episodes to not be novelized, despite the fact that it is probably one of the most imaginative, funny and even most accessible to new viewers of the series.  It is cheifly written by Douglas Adams, known for his multi-media work THE  HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. (In fact, the plot for Adams' third  HITCHHIKER book was orginally proposed as DOCTOR WHO AND THE KRIKKETMEN,  which was turned down for being too silly.) Genre fans may also recognize  character actor Julian Glover from INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE or  very briefly in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Monty Python's John Cleese and  Eleanor Bron also have cameos. Incidentally, CITY OF DEATH is probably the  strongest example of the on-screen chemistry between Tom Baker and Lalla  Ward. (They were married a little over a year later.) All in all, this is  probably the best post-KEY TO TIME Tom Baker story.",947635200,8,925,4.7974683544303796
551820,4,630305885X,"When one takes the actual concept for the story and makes it stand on its own, City of Death appears very weak.  The Doctor and Romana become involved in the time scheme of the Jaggorath, last of his kind, whose being  has been splintered throughout time.  But when you add in Douglas Adams'  witty script editing, strong performances by Baker and Ward, great location  shooting in Paris and a cameo appearance by John Cleese and you've got a  fun story.  Strongest story of a season of losers.",945993600,2,494,4.609195402298851
551821,3,630305885X,"Saying that this story is the best of the season it appeared in isn't honestly that much of a compliment,since it appeared alongside such horrors as Destiny of the Daleks and the Horns of Nimon. The biggest problem is  that Douglas Adams simply rips off Kurt Vonnegut for his plot -- involving  humanity used as a tool for an alien plot -- and then throws in more of his  brand of silliness, undermining any sort of dramatic tension. Whereas his  comedy writing works great within the Hitchhiker series, in Doctor Who any  sort of self-deprecating humor draws too much attention to certain  inherently ridiculous qualities of the series, which work when allowed to  sit in the background, but ruin it if pushed to the front. Some fine acting  by the supporting cast, but Tom Baker is in full-on ham form, and can  become extremely annoying if you remember his intelligent performances from  his first three seasons. Enjoyable, but there are better. Yes, John Cleese  has a cameo,and no, it doesn't make it any better.",945820800,4,1017,4.787356321839081
551822,5,630305885X,"The Doctor and Romana visit Paris 1979.  Cracks appear in the fabric of time.  Count Scarlioni sells multiple copies of great works of art to finance his time-travel experiments.  A detective (and one-story companion  of sorts) becomes the most bumbling accidental hero since Harry Sullivan.  John Cleese admires a certain police box parked in the Louvre.  Leonardo  DaVinci isn't home when the Doctor visits Italy 1505, but there is another  familiar face there.  And the killer line, delivered by the Doctor, a la  Groucho Marx: ""Well... you're a very attractive woman  probably..."" Douglas Adams wrote Dr Who stories with the same madcap  flair he would soon use for his Hitchhiker's Guide and Dirk Gently  novels... And I also love the Doctor's line when Duggan asks him where he  and Romana are from.  Oh, and it's a bit cheaper than most of the other Dr  Who tapes!

Apart from the great performance by Julian Glover, cameo by John Cleese, and great location shooting (although they do seem to spend  a lot of time running round Paris saying 'look we've got the budget to go  to Paris'), the best part of this story is the script.

552065,5,630305885X,"City of Death is just superb. Doctor Who (in the classic era) is usually a show you have to enjoy ""in spite of"" issues caused mostly by the show's budget leading to stories where Doctor Who's reach exceeds its grasp.

No such problem here. The production values are amazing. There's lots of Paris location shooting and it's absolutely fabulous.  Even the shots of Earth ""400 million years ago"" are far better than a typical Doctor Who landscape. The camera work is inspired with some amazing shots and angles in this one. And then there's the musical score which is just fantastic. It's pure class.

The performances are great with Tom Baker pulling in a usual solid performance in addition to Julian Glover as a superb villain as the Count, and Tom Chadbon as the ever-violent Duggan.

As for the story itself, it sets up a great premise that draws you regarding jumps in time (though strangely enough that doesn't happen after Episode 1) and seven original copies of the Mona Lisa, with the Doctor going back in time to ask Leonardo what's going on. The solution is clever, although the cosmology is silly and it actually contradicts other Doctor Who stories, but the story is pulled off with enough style that that doesn't matter. This remains one of Tom Baker's very best.",1415577600,,1276,4.7342342342342345

552070,4,630305885X,"This is one of those stories, starring Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, where there exists the all-too-common nuance of *lots* of running around here and there to fill in for large segments of script that was either never written or perhaps snipped out. Still, it's a better-than average yarn overall.

THE STORY: An alien (the last of his race) has launched ""shards"" of himself into oblivion when his spaceship explodes long before man's presence on earth. Somehow, these pieces return to exist as entire beings, disguised as humans, throughout various epochs of Earth's history. The alien's objective is to go back to that egregious moment and manipulate history so that his ship doesn't detonate and thus his race can live on. Well, we all know that The Doctor cannot allow such nonsense as that.

Meanwhile, The Doctor's (Baker) and Romana II's (Ward) holiday in contemporary Paris is thus train-wrecked. The enigmatic instant is first detected in a caf&eacute; as the two experience a slight time wrinkle, another more dynamic force occurring while the two view the Mona Lisa, a priceless painting which the alien is about to steal to finance the necessary research and equipment to complete his time machine.

Due to The Doctor's continuing interference with his plans, the disguised alien, (who actually has a greedy human wife who is unaware of his extraterrestrial status!), captures The Doctor, Romana, and a bumbling plain-clothes cop who finds himself on board with helping the pair of time travelers. Lots of running around Paris ensues, The Doctor makes a visit to Leonardo da Vinci, and the alien attempts to commence his hawking of fake Mona Lisas.

This story incorporates plenty of humor which some fans prefer to see maintained at a minimum. David Fisher wrote the original story but the Script Editor, the late Douglas Adams of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hitchhiker-s-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/dp/0345391802/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>&nbsp;fame, altered it so much that the standard script-writer alias, ""David Agnew"", was substituted. One positive caveat: this was probably composer Dudley Simpson's finest moment as his clever incidental music really enhances the story although he did confess to ""borrowing"" some major elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-in-Paris/dp/B003A05TI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American in Paris</a>... and rightfully so. Even Douglas Adams' dear friend, the rascally John Cleese, snags a cameo in this one (more humor) so there's that.

By this point in his career as The Fourth Doctor, Baker was losing some of his dynamism and enthusiasm for the program and unfortunately it shows more than a little. He had become somewhat unmanageable for the Production Nabobs (chiefly causing palpitations for Producer Graham Williams), occasionally improvising his own lines and adding one-liners to the rehearsed script. Baker eventually married Lalla Ward and, from all accounts, it was a turbulent relationship and it certainly did not endure for long. Fortunately they were apparently getting along during this production and much goodwill on the set was also likely attributable to Director Michael Hayes, whose laid-back approach made him popular with Baker and most others. The story having been shot largely on location in Paris augmented the final production's great look.

I should mention that a second supplementary disc manifests pure treasure for Classic Doctor Who fans with a lot of insight devoted to mischievous production happenings, both on the set and off. One dubious entry on this disc entitled ""Eye on Blatchford"" probably conveys a lot more meaning for Brits than it did for me.

There are much better Tom Baker Doctor Who stories and this one cannot compare to the work he achieved with Elisabeth Sladen or Louise Jameson, or even with Mary Tamm, (Romana I), for that matter. Still, this four-episode, (100 minutes), romp is a must for any fan of Tom Baker as The Fourth Doctor.",1410134400,,4091,5.546474358974359

552162,5,630305885X,"While I have heard that the 17th season of Doctor Who is considered by quite a few fans to be one of the worst seasons of the whole franchise, this story is often hailed as one of the best.

552168,5,630305885X,"A narrative that entails main production moves from the UK to the city of Paris France. It was the first Doctor Who serial to be filmed on location outside of the United Kingdom; the production team worked in Paris during April and May 1979. There are plenty reviews here that mulled over the plot lines, so this review will forgo this. For me there were some real highlights. One of these good points - John Cleese and Eleanor Bron were persuaded to make a cameo appearance in a short scene, on the proviso that there was no pre-publicity regarding their appearance. For this viewer it was real treat and whole scene was really very funny. Another thing that really worked in the production was the shots of the Jagaroth spacecraft taking off from the prehistoric Earth - as this aspect of the shoot were overseen by Ian Scoones, a veteran of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds.

For me City of Death was one the best of the seventeenth season. Adams' refined comedy script made it easily the wittiest and most quotable the series ever achieved"". Scarlioni's costume and the mask, at the time really lend themselves to the piece and that mask was truly scary at the time.",1402185600,,1167,4.665048543689321
552169,5,630305885X,"City of Death is a perfect example of classic Doctor Who storytelling at it's best.  With the fantastic Tom Baker at his very best as the Fourth Doctor along with the engaging Lalla Ward as Romana II, the two Time Lords battle the Scaroth played by villainously talented Julian Glover in 1979 Paris with the very existence of life on Earth at stake.  Although the story takes place primarily in Paris, the story's arc spans from 400 millions BCE to Renaissance Florence and the aforementioned Paris in a tightly focused adventure in time.  Tom Chadbon as the human wrecking ball detective Duggan as the human companion to the Doctor and Romana provides moments of light comedic relief and sometimes frustration to both Time Lords.

The camera work featuring the city of Paris was spectacular with wonderful angles on various shots that help gravity to the pieces of art seen throughout the story.  The dialogue, the character interactions, and surprise cameos that are only a bonus on top of a wonderful story make this one of the best Doctor Who stories ever.",1400284800,2,1060,4.834254143646409

At the Louvre, the Doctor observes a mysterious woman scoping out the Mona Lisa, and then he and Romana are followed by a man in a trenchcoat. The coated man turns out to be an English detective named Duggan, who is hot on the trail of the enigmatic Count Scarlioni, who has been selling priceless works of art on the black market.

The three are taken prisoner by some goons and brought to Scarlioni's mansion, where they learn that the woman from the Louvre in the Count's wife, and that the two are planning to steal the Mona Lisa. In the meantime, the Count and a scientist named Professor Kerensky are conducting dangerous time travel experiments in the cellar, which is conveniently where Scarlioni has the Doctor and friends locked up. While trying to escape, they discover a hidden room containing six Mona Lisas... and they're all the original!

The Doctor dispatches Romana and Duggan to try and prevent the Countess and her men from stealing the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, while he uses the TARDIS to travel back in time to 1505 to ask Leonardo Da Vinci why he painted six extra copies of the Mona Lisa... only to be captured by an exact double of Count Scarlioni, who calls himself ""Captain Tancredi,"" and is holding Leonardo prisoner and is the one who forced him to paint duplicates of the portrait.

Back in 1979, Romana and Duggan fail to stop the theft of the ""real"" Mona Lisa and in trying to get it back are captured again. The present day Count Scarlioni reveals what he is attempting to do - go back and time and prevent the extinction of his people, the Jagaroth, during prehistoric times. Scarlioni is an alien! He demands that Romana assist him or else he'll use Kerensky's time machine to trap Paris in a gigantic time bubble and cause everyone in it to die of rapid old age, transforming Paris into a city of death (title drop!). Will Romana cooperate? Can the Doctor escape from the Count's other self in 1505 and make it back to the present to stop him before all of Paris, and maybe even all of human history, is destroyed forever?

At the Count's home he and his wife plan on stealing the Mona Lisa and with it able to fund the expirments going on.
  The Doctor and Romana discover they are being followed and meet with Inspector Duggan. The very man following them.  Duggan has been tracking the Countess for sometime and with links to selling valuable pieces of art work and other items.  What Duggan can't figure out is where is the Count getting all of these items and what is the money from these sales going towards?
  The Count hearing from his wife the chance encounter with the Doctor decides to not take anything to chance and sends his men to capture the Doctor and Romana and see what they know.  The Doctor and Duggan exchanging notes at a cafe are held at gunpoint and brought before the Count and Countess.  The Count thinks the Doctor is clever and wants to keep an eye on him and lock him in an old store room.  While locked up the Doctor discovers six copies of the Mona Lisa. What would the Count want with a seventh copy of the Mona Lisa and what does all of this have to do with the expirements in time? The Doctor has to travel in the past to discover what is going while Romana and Duggan try and figure out what the Count is working on in the present.
  The Doctor finds Leonardo out and leaves him a message only to be stopped by a man who looks like the Count in 1979, but is clearly a man from the rennaisace. This man calling himself Captain Tancerlli. Stranger still this man knows who the Doctor is and wants to know what he is doing in the past of human history.  The Doctor makes a discovery the likes of which none could have seen. The Count from 1979 and Captain Trancerlli are one in the same. In fact several more versions of him live through out human history to further technology to the point in 1979 so that they can go back 400 million years and save themselves from a ship explosion and save his entire race the Jagaroth.  Can the Doctor stop the Count and his dangerous expierments in time? Will the Count succed and stop life from ever starting on Earth?

Instead, I want to rave about the commentary track by Michael hayes (director), Michael Chadbon (Duggan), and Julian Glover (Scaroth).  Having grown up with all these shows on PBS from 1978 through the 80s, I've seen them all dozens of times.  Now I buy the DVDs for nostalgia and the extras, particularly the commentaries.  This show didn't have the main star, the writer, the companion, or the producer commenting--disappointing.  However, these three were all reminiscing as good friends and having a fun afternoon admiring their old work and commenting on the production techniques then and now.  Excellent fun to listen to.

If you're a real nerd, the ""episode production note"" subtitles are full of random facts (Douglas Adams wrote this episode in one alcohol-filled weekend, for example) and quite fun.",1185235200,,366,4.809523809523809
552581,5,630305885X,"Certain storylines of ""Doctor Who"" reverberated as distinct images in my memory during the years between my youthful enthusiasm in the 80's and my somewhat recent rediscovery of this wonderful show. They stood out clearly from the vague nostalgic haze that the many episodes had become in my mind. They were memorable. One of the more powerful of these without a doubt was ""City of Death""--and the decades have done nothing to diminish its power. If anything, like a fine wine it has improved with age.

First off, this story is incredibly well-written, combining an ingeniously creative science fiction concept from Douglas Adams with suspenseful adventure along the lines of a Pink Panther detective tale or else the Da Vinci Code without the mystical edge. Once again Douglas Adams' dry, quirky sense of humor dovetails perfectly with Tom Baker's eccentric characterization of the Doctor, and this humor fits seamlessly into the story either as diversionary tactics by the Doctor in adversity or else simply to offset and counterpoint the enormity of the story's premise: A starship with the last survivors of a planet's race exploding as it attempts to take off in warp from the primitive Earth's surface, killing all but the pilot while sparking life on this planet--meanwhile, the pilot, Scaroth, is split into twelve fragments across the span of human history, where he/they work to impel human civilization forward technologically ultimately so that he can go back to that fateful moment and so undo his race's destruction (retroactively erasing the evolution of life on this planet in the process, of course).

All of that sounds a bit complicated in summary, but the dimensions of the tale unfold gradually and naturally in a finely crafted plotline also involving Scaroth's masterplan to fund his scientific research by selling seven Mona Lisa paintings to private collectors--one stolen from the Louvre, six (genuinely by Da Vinci, no less) in his basement. This in turn allows the writers to cleverly weave into this already masterful tale a subtle meditation on the uses (& misuses) and value of art. And Scaroth is played masterfully by Julian Glover, who brings a sinister sophistication and smooth cruelty to the role along with a wickedly dry sense of humor of his own. He is also a very believable villain whose motivations are understandable if reprehensible to us in their implications. Who wouldn't try to save his own people, after all?

Everything else about ""City of Death"" fits like a glove, too. The location shots in Paris are very nice indeed--sure, it's good to see that the Tardis can go somewhere on modern Earth besides merry ol' England, but the location of France's artistic capital is integral to the story, too, and thus much more than merely a neat but inconsequential backdrop. Lalla Ward's regenerated Romana has a natural rapport and chemistry with Tom Baker's Doctor that Mary Tamm, for all her fine abilities, just fundamentally lacked somehow, and that comes across especially strongly in this storyline. Even the special effects are excellent and 99.99% believable to the eye, and Scaroth's starship is convincingly alien and yet aesthetically cool in design and is utterly a showpiece of model-making on a slim budget. And the cameo appearance of John Cleese pontificating pretentiously on the artistic merits of the ""afunctional"" Tardis is a superb little touch.

In short, ""City of Death"" is a quintessential ""Doctor Who"" masterpiece, an unforgettable classic--why, it's practically a work of art itself.",1180569600,4,3552,5.150779896013865

City Of Death does have a few good things going for it ; it stars the second best assistant in Doctor Who history, Lalla Ward as Romana. Very sexy.  It also has a great story behind it.

552583,5,630305885X,"This is one of the most enjoyable stories from the old series.  Tom Baker's Doctor was already the top of the incarnations (and would remain so) as far as most fans were concerned.  Add his truely alien performance of the title character with the witty, off-the-wall comedy of Douglas Adams; and you get a four parter that's always a joy.  Great dialogue.  Fantastic cast with a John Cleese cameo.  Most importantly, it's something that the whole family can watch and enjoy on their own personal level.

This script shows that Adams was more interested in character and concepts than the actual narrative style.  If you took the time to think about the story, there are many plot holes and jumps; but that's not what Adams was about.  He was about the strange universe and characters romping around in time and space and just what it's all for.  Does art become art because someone can place a monetary value on it?  Or is it art because it is something beautiful and crafted?

If you like Doctor Who or The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, or both, this is the perfect addition to your DVD collection.  Bonuses include interviews with Douglas Adams himself as well as other cast and crew.  A documentary on how the story evolved into one of the most (if not the most) popular episodes in Who history.  Plus, skits with Tom Baker and John Cleese having fun and showing their comedic chops.",1143417600,4,1389,4.639344262295082
552634,5,630305885X,"Is there any chance that the upcoming ""Da Vinci Code"" movie is going to be as fabulous as ""City of Death""?  Both stories tell us that the world we know is a lie, that the mythology on which we have built our lives is based on a carefully fabricated and jealously protected false premise.

In ""City of Death"", those mysteries are uncovered by private eye Tom Chadbon, coincidentally dressed as Tintin, and those same mysteries have been guarded by Julian Glover, who was so suave that he went on to play a bad guy in films from three quintessential action franchise movies in the '80s (Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones).

But in ""The Da Vinci Code"", we just get Tom Hanks again.

This is ""The Big Lebowski"" of ""Doctor Who"" scripts: every line is brilliant; even the bits of dialogue that are supposed to be serious exposition are drop-dead funny.  The all-star cast of Glover and Chadbon, not to mention the brilliant Doctor/companion team of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, takes this hilarious script -- written by Douglas Adams in one weekend while consuming pots and pots of black coffee -- and play every scene dead straight, right down the middle.  The story produced right before ""City"" was ""The Creature From The Pit"", which has since been reduced to a cautionary tale about what happens when you don't play comedy dead straight, right down the middle.

As has been written elsewhere, the story is plotted so tightly you could sing it like an opera.  Scaroth, the last survivor of a vicious reptilian race, is fractured into 12 identical ""splinters"" of himself, set adrift in Earth's history and working to advance the human race to the point where a nebbishy Russian scientist can build him a small time machine.  Scaroth's prior selves have hoarded the great art treasures of humanity: Gutenberg bibles, Gainsborough paintings, and seven original ""Mona Lisa""s, all so that his 1979 self can sell them to buy the technology he needs.  Which he will then use to save his people by preventing the cataclysm that, coincidentally, made life on Earth possible.

Because Julian Glover's villain is so suave and assured, he gets the rare ""Who"" trifecta of getting the final close-up of every cliffhanger.  All right, in Part One it's not really him -- it's his stunt double's nose or chin visible through an aperture in the reptile mask -- but Glover's stern visage ends Part Two, and his smiling photo op self concludes Part Three just as he's killed off the Russian scientist in gruesome fashion.  His line readings are a primer on how to speak the English language properly.

The DVD restoration team pulled out all the stops for the ""City of Death"" extras.  The story itself didn't need a whole lot of work, so instead they've restored 25 minutes of raw camera footage, which had been recorded onto a kind of videotape that was obsolete the day it was recorded and so managed to avoid being wiped by the BBC, or stuffed under a highway like ""The Wicker Man"" film cans.  The DVD also presents the raw film of the story's model effects -- a spaceship taking off and exploding, and five chickens acting the role of a single bird that ages to death inside an unstabilized time field.

The audio commentary doesn't feature Tom or Lalla, but it does have Chadbon and Glover (a huge addition to the DVD, huge), and director Michael Hayes, commenting on the story.  Most prior ""Who"" commentaries feature aging actors and directors kvelling over lame 1970s relics that ""really stand the test of time!"" even when they didn't (Exhibit HHH: ""The Claws of Axos"").  Chadbon, Hayes and Glover are more realistic.  They actually compare this story to the production values and shooting schedule 2005 season of ""Doctor Who""!  They also discuss ""Doctor Who"" conventions at length.  It's great to hear Glover rediscover a role he's not seen in some time; I loved hearing his delight when he realiezd that Kerensky's death scene prefigured his own in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".

My favorite extra is the making of documentary.  This is not just your standard press-kit where talking heads praise the performance of each and every cast and crew member.  You've gotta raise the bar for ""City of Death"".  So DW book author Jonathan Morris, who wrote the dead-on Douglas Adams homage ""Festival of Death"", wrote the script.  Two writers from the 2005 DW series comment on what makes the story work, at the same time that Hayes, Chadbon and Glover tell us why they loved making it so much.  The narration is hilarious, and the reconstruction of David Fisher's original and abandoned script, via pretty color illustrations, is nifty.

We learn how Adams took a complicated, wide-ranging script and, over the course of one weekend, stripped it down into a story that utilized just a few sets, a minimal cast, 13 filmed minutes of actors jogging through Paris -- and turned it into one of ""Doctor Who""'s shining moments, that one story where everything just fit together perfectly.

552637,4,630305885X,"Before Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, the late Douglas Adams (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) re-penned this goofy romp through Paris, history and prehistory. He has the badie planning to steal the Mona Lisa in order to sell fakes that aren't fake at all, then executing said plan in order to fund his secret, posthumous, alien-agenda.

 ""City of Death"", broadcast in 1979 as the second story of season seventeen, is one of the few outstanding story arcs in one of the weakest Tom Baker seasons. Although, the guest cast and cameos are impressive, featuring Julian Glover (Indiana Jone and the Last Crusade) , Catherine Schell and David Graham amongst others, with John Cleese and Eleanor Bron (in episode four). The script full of clever, inspired dialogue and the location filming in Paris, a first for the show, makes the story seem more impressive. Tom Baker's over the top humorous acting does seem to fit the bill here. Lalla Ward as Romana is still finding her character (given her unfortunate choice of outfits in this) in her second story, but the relationship between her and Baker is developing so nicely (in and out-of-character, the couple married later) that the story is a pleasure to watch. Then, the addition of the thick, British detective Duggan provides for a good foil for the pair. There are moment's of classic Adams' Adams' brilliance, like the Doctor writing ""This is a Fake!"" on DaVinci's canvases or his intial scream as thumb-screws are applied to his hands yelling, ""His hands are cold."" This was Adams' last Dr. Who script, ""SHADA"", was abandoned midway through filming due to a BBC strike and he didn't continue as the script editor. Although, had it been completed, ""Shada"" would have proved a better story than ""City.""  What I remember most about seeing ""City of Death"" sticks out now upon a more recent screening as, ""a lot of running around Paris, with some time travel tossed in the mix.""

Normally I love DVD extras, especially on Dr. Who DVDs, this wasn't one of those times. The extras have been added to a second disc, thus raising the cost for what in this case seems like no good reason (unlike ""Curse of Fenric""). Unused studio footage and out-takes from episode one, a look at the locations, a short documentary. These bonuses aren't all that great, they're too long, repeating information already available in the text, the post adventure faux documentary about the alien character's life after the show isn't very good. The commentary is also disappointing, without Baker or Ward (nor the late Douglas Adams) taking part with the job left to the director and the two guest actors, Julian Glover and Tom Chadbon with little to relate about the series as a whole. I'm not clear on the process used for selecting the order that Dr. Who DVDs are being released, but there are better Tom Baker 4th Doctor episodes out there than should be released first.

552639,5,630305885X,"The latest pair of DVD releases from the BBC's Doctor Who archive, the last for 2005, brings together stories from the second season of the third Doctor and the second to last of the fourth. The Claws of Axos and City of Death both came into being due to script problems which caused earlier ideas to fall through, with the latter story being written in one weekend by the production team themselves. Both stories certainly work well, but a lot will depend on how you view Doctor Who overall.

The Claws of Axos is the third story from the eighth season of the show, broadcast in the late winter of 1971. Starring Jon Pertwee in his second season, this was the third consecutive story to feature the Doctor and his U.N.I.T. colleagues facing the renegade Time Lord, The Master, on present day Earth. Even by this early stage, the repetitive use of The Master was beginning to bore, as was the ""The Doctor exiled on Earth"" storyline that had been in place since the start of season seven in 1970. However, there is a twist to this adventure in that The Doctor and The Master do manage to leave Earth briefly in the Doctor's TARDIS to defeat the Axon aliens.

Originally conceived as a seven-part adventure, the writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin who had never written for the show before, struggled with the cuts that were needed to bring the story initially down to five episodes and later to four. Clearly for

the writers, they were somewhat out of their depth; and it shows. Some of the concepts explored in the storyline don't seem to go anywhere as a result of the cuts and the science, particularly the nuclear science, is preposterous. Ignoring the weakness of the plot and script, there is still a lot to enjoy here. The design is truly astounding, particularly the organic Axon spaceship, and the striking lighting is remarkable. The alien costumes are very well executed and the assembled cast certainly put in very impressive performances, with the exception of a British government official who's just plain annoying. It's a simple, enjoyable romp and the commentary provided by producer Barry Letts and two of the show's regular cast, Katy Manning and Richard Franklin (making his DVD debut) provides a genuinely interesting and charming bonus.

In addition to the commentary and on-screen captions, there are also many other goodies to enjoy as bonuses. Unused studio footage and out-takes from episode one, a look at the locations used throughout and a short documentary about the making of the program are all genuinely interesting and entertaining, kept just to the right length. The same cannot be said for the companion release, City of Death, broadcast in 1979 as the second story of season seventeen.

City of Death enjoys exalted status in the Doctor Who canon, as it was penned by possibly the most famous and illustrious writer ever associated with the series, the late Douglas Adams of Hitchhiker's fame. This was the second of three scripts he contributed to the show, albeit in tandem with the show's producer Graham Williams from an aborted script by David Fisher, under the pseudonym, David Agnew. Adams had written one story for the previous season, the popular Pirate Planet and had been appointed the show's script editor as a result. A job, quite frankly, he was not entirely suited for. Indeed, season seventeen is widely regarded to contain some of the weakest scripts in the history of the series. Which is something of a paradox when you consider this season attracted the highest viewing figures in Doctor Who's entire forty plus year history. At this time, the UK only had three TV channels, and the most popular of these, ITV, was off the air due to a strike. With only BBC1 and BBC2 to watch, the BBC's ratings naturally soared and Doctor benefited from this is much as any other programme, with this particular story achieving ratings in excess of fifteen million. But what viewers saw clearly wasn't impressive to them as the ratings plummeted once ITV returned to the airwaves.

City of Death is indeed a very enjoyable and accomplished story, which does stand out in an otherwise dreadful season. The guest cast is highly impressive, featuring Julian Glover, Catherine Schell and David Graham amongst others, with John Cleese and Eleanor Bron making surprise cameo appearances in episode four. The script simply sparkles with wit and clever dialogue and the overseas location filming in Paris, a first for the show, makes the story even more impressive. All rather surprising considering that the scripts had to be written from scratch over one single weekend, with filming due to start the following week. Tom Baker is certainly at the height of his powers, and for once his over the top humorous acting does seem to fit the bill. Lalla Ward as Romana is still finding her way in this, her second story, but their relationship is building nicely and the addition of the British detective Duggan (Tom Chadbon) is a good foil for both characters. As a stand alone story, you probably can't beat this adventure, but in the context of the wider season, it's an oasis in a desert for sure. Adam's next (and last) script was abandoned midway through filming due to a BBC strike and he didn't continue beyond this season as the script editor. Nor was Williams retained as Producer. Why that should be is explained in the documentary bonus that comes on disc two, where pretty much everyone involved in the production admits Adam's limited abilities in this area.

Normally the bonuses are what make the Doctor Who DVD's worth every penny, regardless of the quality of the particular story. In the case of City of Death, this is not the case. For no justifiable reason whatsoever, all the extras for this show have

been added as a second disc, jacking up the price quite unnecessarily. In addition, these bonuses aren't all that great. They're too long in the main and simply repeat information available in the text that accompanies the episodes. Some of the extras completely fall flat, particularly a mock-umentary about the alien character's life after the show. The commentary is also very disappointing, with neither Baker or Ward (nor obviously the late Williams or Adams) taking part with the job left to the director and the two main guest actors, Julian Glover and Tom Chadbon. Both actors think very highly of the show and are clearly delighted to see it again, but their limited Doctor Who experience and knowledge means it's impossible for them to relate to anything other than these four episodes and there are long silences for sure.

All in all, this is a disappointing release, the two disc format being totally unnecessary. The fact that I enjoyed the disc of the weaker, earlier adventure the Claws of Axos more, is quite shocking in many ways. Hopefully the BBC won't get carried away in terms of bonuses for the sake of filling space in the future which mars the otherwise excellent City of Death.",1132185600,4,6956,4.828859060402684

552759,5,630305885X,"This story works best when taken as the light comedy that it's intended to be.  Tom Baker is never more witty.  City of Death has everything:

Location (Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Mona Lisa, and even a stereotypically rude French prick sitting in the cafe sketching Romana.)

Cast (Not only do we have the Doctor and Romana, who share a tremendous chemistry together, but we also enjoy Julian Glover as the sinister Scarlioni/Jagaroth. Add to that Duggan, a bumbling English detective who thinks he is Moe from the Three Stooges (I never thought I'd get Doctor Who and Three Stooges in the same breath!) At one point the Doctor snaps at Duggan, ""That's your philosophy.  If it moves, hit it"".  We won't mention that Duggan's nasty habit of slugging first and asking questions later actually saves the day in the end.  ""Duggan, that may have been the most important punch in Earth's history!""  And who can forget the brief but very effective cameo by John Cleese?)

Plot (All the elements of a well-told story, sprinkled with a touch of humor Tom Baker-style.  We have plot twists that keep the viewer from getting bored. How can you have 7 genuine Mona Lisas?  Watch the story and find out.  City of Death concludes with another possible explanation, albeit fiction, of how life on earth originated.)

Fans of Doctor Who rank City of Death as one of the best, if not the best, Who story.  It certainly justifies inclusion in anyone's top 5 Doctor Who programs, up there with Inferno and Pyramids of Mars",1104969600,2,1513,4.7251908396946565
552760,5,630305885X,"In this memorable story, the time travelers played by Tom Baker and Lalla Ward show chemistry and wit as subtly sly as the smile on the Mona Lisa, which is what they go hunting for after landing in Paris 1979 on a Holiday.  The on-location filming makes excellent use of local Parisian sites, and Dudley Simpson's incidental music (usually used just to dramatize certain moments) sounds as if an entire score were composed just for this story.  The Doctor and Romana gradually become enmeshed in a plot involving sophisticated but devious art dealers, a semi-hard boiled English detective, and curiously advanced time experiments being conducted by a humble Russian scientist.  What ties these threads together makes for a fascinating yarn, woven by well-known British sci-fi author Douglas Adams.  The villians are mysterious, wealthy patrons of art and science: Count Scarlioni (Julian Glover--an imperial officer from the Star Wars films who also appeared in the James Bond film: For Your Eyes Only), and his consort the Countess (Catherine Schell--Lady Litton from The Return of the Pink Panther), an oddly appropriate complement to the somewhat schizophrenic Count, whose connection with an ancient alien being makes him a hinge on which world history turns.  [Look for conceptual similarities in the book Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective agency.]  Along with the trenchcoat-wearing detective Duggan, the Time Lord and Time Lady, who dresses like an English schoolgirl here, spend much of their time gallivanting around Paris trying to save life on Earth from destruction.  Endearingly and cleverly written with a brilliant cast, this is among the best Doctor Who stories.",1094515200,2,1677,5.329545454545454

Then again, most of this season is more or less witty, even Destiny of the Daleks and Craeture from the Pit are witty from time to time. But they're dismissed as rubbish, which they are, but for some reason this is praised to the hilt, probably because this actually looks fairly good with slick production, location filming in Paris and stylish human baddies, one of whom is revealed as an alien. But it's really not much better than the rest of the silly season. If Dr. Who was a light weight comedy show, this would be a giant. But since its a Science Fiction drama, adventure and suspense series, this tale of a masked alien whose head is too big to fit in his mask is overrated beyond belief. It's just another case of, if you're nuts about Tom Baker and assume he's always a genius, you'll love it. If you find him a right bore who lacks the depth of Pertwee, Davison and Troughton, you'll see this pap for what it is!

 and a lot more lines!",1054771200,,308,4.375
552763,3,630305885X,"City of Death is distinguished from the other Tom Baker Who episodes by virtue of two things: 1) it is essentially a comedy, rather than a campy drama with strong tongue-in-cheek humor (like most Who episodes) and 2) there is a definite, quasi-romantic vibe going between Tom Baker and his wife (and ex-wife) to be, Lala Ward. Maybe it was the Paris setting; maybe Tom and Lala were so ga-ga for each other at this point they couldn't hide it; but I can't recall any episode with any female companion where the relationship seems quite so intimate. These two factors make ""City"" a bit of a departure from the norm. I am not as enamored of this episode as many fans are, but it is still very enjoyable. On the downside, I found the long travelogue shots of Paris to be a bit boring and time-consuming, the actor who plays Professor Kirinsky to be a giant ham, and some of the plot elements to be absurd beyond the usual level of absurdity (no one in that cafe seems to care about the goons who keep coming in to stick up the Doctor at gunpoint). Those are, however, pretty weak criticisms. On the plus side, Baker, who was beginning to flag a bit in his enthusiasm for the role at this point in his seven-year run, clearly had a ball with the fast-paced, completely comedic script. His biggest strength as an actor was always his ability to recognize when a plot moment or bit of dialogue was ridiculous, and then use humor to make it fly. In this episode he gets plenty of chances and clearly enjoyed all of them. The Duggan character was hackneyed (nice trenchcoat) but also quite funny as a sort of male Leela who is not terribly bright but terribly keen on breaking things and punching people in the face. His interplay with the Doctor is very good (""Duggan, if you do that again I am going to take very severe measures with you."" ""Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?"" ""I'm going to ask you not to do it again.""), and he works equally well with Romana. Skaroth's polite, homicidal butler is also a huge kick (""Kill those two fools please, Harold,"" says Skarroth. ""With pleasure, sir,"" replies the butler). The brass ring however goes to Julian Glover as Skarroth/Count Scarleoni, who sci-fi fans will always remember as General Veers in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", one of the fortunate imperial officers who Vader does not strangle for ineptitude. Glover has beautifully campy dialogue and he plays it out with relish as a profoundly evil villain who never loses his sense of whimsy or humor (""This is going to be a treat. Please remain here while I bring the instruments of torture."") even when he has to wear the disgusting Jaggeroth costume. The plot seemed thin and somewhat confusing at times as it goes along, but everything ties in very nicely at the end....except for the fact that for such a warlike race, the Jaggeroth don't seem to be able to take a punch very well. I guess that's why they're extinct. Anyway, while I don't regard ""City of Death"" as a classic, it remains a must-have for the true fan's collection.",1051401600,8,3024,4.5504587155963305
552764,5,630305885X,"Not just for fans, City Of Death is for those folks who either have never seen Dr Who or were unfortunate enough to see one of the truly BAD ones and never watched again. I mean, you can't sit them down to just any story. That is why, for Tom Baker's era, I recommend City Of Death as one of the gold list. A great story setting, great performances by cast regulars and supporting actors, an interesting plot that carries through four episodes, a minimum of cheap effects, etcetera, etcetera, and so on. City Of Death shines, especially since that season of stories produces very little classic Who otherwise.",1044835200,,609,4.5963302752293576
552765,5,630305885X,"The Doctor and Romana are on holiday in Paris, 1979, which among the vintage of years, is ""more of a table wine.  Lacks true distinction.""  They become involved in the doings of Count Scarlioni, a filthy rich art collector who has recently attracted attention by selling heretofore presumed lost masterpieces.  He also seems to be selling genuine looking fakes, such as a Gainsborough and a Guttenberg Bible.  Also investigating is Duggan, a dim British detective in beige trenchcoat who mainly likes thumping people.
Time suddenly jumps a groove for a few seconds, and it is the temporally sensitive Time Lords who notice and realize that something funny is going on.  It happens for the second time in the Louvre and while the Doctor is looking at the Mona Lisa.  He snatches an unusual bracelet from a pretty woman.  Question:  what is an Earth woman doing wearing a micromeson scanner, which could be used for detecting the Louvre's alarm system?
The Count is involved in conducting some time experiments with the help of the meek Russian scientist Theodor Nikolai Kerensky.  For a sample of what he's working on, check the scene involving the egg and chicken.
This was the first of three foreign on-location stories, the other two being the Netherlands (Arc Of Infinity) and Spain (The Two Doctors).  The story moves quickly in order to flesh out the Parisian scenery, but it's the snappy and witty dialogue that really uplifts this story.  Example:
Romana:  Shall we take the lift or fly?
Doctor:  Let's not be ostentatious.
Romana:  Let's fly then.
Doctor:  That would look silly.  We'll take the lift.
At least one Who book points out that Duggan sees the Doctor and Romana on the ground so quickly in the end, that from the time they left him, they must have flown from the tower.
More witty dialogue:
Romana:  Where are we going?
Doctor:  Philosophically or geographically?
Romana:  Philosophically
Doctor:  Philosophically, we're going to lunch.
And the first thing Romana says when the Doctor introduces her to the Mona Lisa is ""how come she doesn't have any eyebrows?""  Later, the woman who posed for the Mona Lisa is also described by the Doctor as ""that dreadful woman with no eyebrows who wouldn't sit still.""
The Countess (on the Doctor):  I don't think he's as stupid as he seems.
The Count:  Nobody can be as stupid as he seems.
Then there's John Cleese and Eleanor Bron's cameos in Episode 4, where they think the TARDIS is an objet d'art whose afunctionalism belies the fact that the art lies in the fact that it is here.  When it vanishes, Bron says.  ""Exquisite, simply exquisite.""  Which this story is.
Other things:  the cliffhangers to Episode 1 and 2 are superb.  And well-known guest stars are Julian Glover (the Count) who played Richard Coeur de Lion in the Who story The Crusaders and was General Veers in The Empire Strikes Back.  Catherine Schell (Countess) has two famous siblings:  Maximilian and Maria Schell.
This story got the highest viewing figures for any Who story:  16.3 million viewers for episode 4 and an average of 14.5 million viewers overall!  Episode 3 (15.4 million) broke the record set by Episode 4 of the previous story, Destiny of the Daleks (14.4 million)  Finally, Douglas Adams wrote this story under the pseudonym David Agnew.  Scaroth's ultimate goal was replicated in his novel, Dirk Gently And The Holistic Detective Agency.

Lalla Ward's Romana is a mature character who could have easily carried her own series as a Time Lord if the powers that be decided it.

The concept of an alien splintering in time, thus being rendered into separate beings living in different eras (though psychically linked), is unique.

The John Cleese cameo captures, in (sadly) a few seconds, my opinion of the redundant function of the glitterati.  Julian Glover is a great kelp-head, Renaissance prince, and 20th Century plotter.

So instead of ""I'm the Doctor and this is my companion"" we have ""we're Time Lords"". Plus Tom Baker and Lalla Ward's chemistry shows up on screen (they married a year or two later, sadly it didn't last). They arrive in Paris 1979 (more of a table wine year) and proceed to enjoy the sites and sounds. They go to the Louve to see the Mona Lisa and stumble upon a plot to steal it involving some curiously advanced technology. Enter Scalioni (played by Julian Glover, General Veers in Empire Strike's back and Donovan in Indian Jones and the Last Crusade), a rich count with a secret. In reality he is the alien Scarroth, last of the Jagaroth. His spaceship exploded on the surface of prehistoric earth fragmenting his being into several personas throughout history. He is responsible for most all of man's great advances. Now in his last era, he strives to build a time machine to send himself back in time and warn himself of the explosion. Such a paradox would destroy the existence of man. This story is so enjoyable you don't notice some of the obvious plot holes. Thugs robbing the Doctor and companions at gunpoint in the middle of a crowded cafe. Scalioni on a whim telling his butler to kill the same thugs who later show up perfectly unharmed. Scallioni pulling a bundle of a million francs out of his pocket and waving it in a guys face (I laugh my butt off every time I see this scene). Y'see however, the bulk of this story was written by the late Douglas Adams (under a pen name) and it shows. Tom Baker is such a wonderful comedic actor. And Lalla Ward has some great moments of dry wit too. This is Dr. Who at it's best. Look for a cameo by John Cleese.

552832,5,630305885X,"This Tom Baker adventure is one of the most original and satisfying Doctor Who stories that has ever been my pleasure to enjoy. It looks wonderful, it is obvious the cast are all having fun, and the story has a terrific blend of humour and seriousness. It is co-scripted by Douglas Adams, which is an automatic sign that there is going to be a certain degree of zaniness in the story - which there certainly is, but not as convoluted as his previous Who effort, ""The Pirate Planet"". ""City of Death"" is more down to earth (putting it very loosely!), but it certainly has moments edging on the bizarre, including the central premise, which sees all human learning and endeavour as simply an alien being's means to an end (although not new to Doctor Who - see ""The Daemons"" and ""Image of the Fendahl"" among others - but given a more oblique edge). The chief plot device is the Mona Lisa and the attempts of the alien, Scaroth, to steal it. In my humble opinion, the idea of an alien intending to steal the Mona Lisa in order to achieve his goals (which, incidentally, will result in the human race never having existed) is such a wonderful diversion from the standard ""alien invasion"" plot; in fact, so wonderful that it verges on genius! The Doctor/Romana II combination of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward is at its peak here - in this story it is obvious they are such an ideal team, and probably the best indicator that an off screen relationship was developing between these two actors. The guest list in ""City of Death"" is also astounding. The brilliant Julian Glover excels as the alien Scaroth (and his various segments), especially so as the final chronological segment, Count Scarlioni. The Count is an elegant villain, charming, disarming and not without a sense of humour. This is Glover's second of two performances in Doctor Who (his first was as Richard the Lionheart in the William Hartnell tale ""The Crusade"") - what a pity he did not star more times in the programme! The Countess is portrayed by the beautiful Catherine Schell (of Space 1999 fame), who plays up the role tremendously - a glamorous lover/sidekick to the villain, naively unaware that her husband is an alien (perhaps stretching the plot a bit far, but this is Douglas Adams, after all!) Tom Chadbon's Duggan, the dim-witted but amiable detective who joins up with the Doctor and Romana, is another memorable character. Even the lesser roles, such as Professor Kerensky and the butler Hermann, are distinguished. A cameo appearance from John Cleese and Eleanor Bron at the end is the icing on the cake! The story has the honour of being the first Doctor Who adventure filmed outside of the UK - it was made in Paris, and adds to the glamorous feel. The first episode, to its (slight) detriment, is a bit of a travelogue - the Doctor and Romana's walk through the streets of Paris as Duggan follows them IS overindulgent, but because the story is so wonderful, this can be forgiven. ""City of Death"" is a charming story. It is intelligent, while at the same time enjoyable simply as a great adventure. There are also brilliant moments of dialogue, with many memorable exchanges between the characters. It is certainly a breath of fresh air, and the standout tale from a troubled year of Doctor Who.",988934400,26,3269,4.6869565217391305

Placed firmly in what is argueably one of the worst Dr. Who seasons of all time, ""City of Death"" comes out smelling like roses.  But does that make it a good story?
The short answer is, quite frankly, no.  Don't get me wrong--Douglas Adams creates some unique one-liners and the cast appears to be having a good time on location in Paris. But what the story lacks is the sophistication, intelligence and pure enjoyment that made up the early Tom Baker stories.  Tom Baker's unrestrained performance needs to be roped in a bit and Lalla Ward is a bit too understated in only her second appearance as Romana II.  Throw in a storyline that is far too predictable and never really gains any momentum and you've got a mess disguising itself as a classic story.

552836,5,630305885X,"Of all my Who tapes, this is the one I've watched the most.

 This is a great story by Douglas Adams, and the story doesn't suffer in the least from the comical lines scattered throughout. Tom Baker really plays  up the humor of the Doctor, while still taking seriously his role as hero;  Romana makes for a capable companion and kindred spirit for the 4th Doctor;  and the supporting cast is also excellent.

 The story itself has  some interesting ideas. The count/Scaroth exists in 12 different time  periods, but he seems to be experiencing them all in  parallel relative to  his own lifespan. I thought that was a great concept. I can't say much more  without giving the whole plot away, but Scaroth is trying to go back 400  million years and prevent the accident that caused the creation of life on  earth. Another interesting idea (although from what I remember from my  Biology class, the writer missed the probable date of said creation by  about 3 billion years, give or take half a billion). I liked the  implications of the paradox this would create.

 Though I wouldn't  call it suspenseful or intense, the pace of this episode doesn't slow down  at all. The Doctor and Romana, with the help of the cop Duggan, carry the  adventure through the streets of Paris (for once, the aliens aren't in  England), the Louvre, the Count's estate, and a quiet cafe. The good  location shooting in Paris isn't overdone, as it's such a refreshing change  from the usual featureless corridor or quarry.
