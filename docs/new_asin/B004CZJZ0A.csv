8424136,3,B004CZJZ0A,"When I ordered the dvd's I thoiught they were the documentary that was on tv a week or so ago, so I was a little dissapointed.",1426896000,5,126,3.8846153846153846
8424137,5,B004CZJZ0A,"Absolutely love this. Had seen it on TV and knew I would eventually have to have it, my heritage being 100% italian. From the meals cooked to the character and determination they brought w/ them to america, to the DESIRE to be Americans to the many who changed or modified there name to enter into different arenas of life........truly interesting part of history that is.......slowly dying.

That said, I was disappointed in what the seller called  the 2DVD set......because the 2nd DVD is really nothing more that pullouts from the first one, w/ maybe one or two things, small, added. This was disappointing and I feel contributed to the higher cost of this 'set'. However you could easily do w/o the 2nd DVD.

When all is said and done, would I order it again.....absolutely. And I am sure I will watch it again and again for as long as I am still here........never to forget.......and to be forever grateful.",1390694400,18,912,4.723270440251572
