7902965,3,B000003KAE,"This episode of Star Trek Voyager is enjoyable enough, but I do not see it as one of the more important episodes from Season Two of the show.
The basic plot involves Lt. Tuvok crashing a shuttle on a moon and discovering 3 unattended children there.  The interaction that subsequently takes place between the children and Tuvok is rather humorous, and sometimes even touching.
Certainly this is a great episode for the character of Tuvok, and Tim Russ, as always, does a good job with what he has been given to work with in this script.  At times, however, the writing is rather slow and the children somewhat annoying.
I give this episode 3 stars, but if you are a Tuvok fan, it's certainly worth seeing.  Not a key Season Two episode, but worth a look.",997142400,2,754,4.529411764705882
