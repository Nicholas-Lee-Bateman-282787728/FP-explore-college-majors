3167717,5,B00177Y9WA,"I discovered this DVD in a recent review in the NYT.  They highly recommended it, and so do I. The DVD consists of three unrelated films: The Red Ensign (1935), The Phantom Light (1935), and the Upturned Glass (1947).  All address different subjects.

The first movie, The Red Ensign, tells the tale of a patriotic British shipbuilder, who intends to use his radical new cargo ship design to bolster the declining British shipbuilding industry. Unable to attract the necessary capitol, he funds the building himself and runs into financial ruin and commercial disasters. It is a highly patriotic story, tracing the shipbuilder's willingness to do anything at any cost to achieve his ends.

The Phantom Light is set in Wales (probably North Wales) and in the first few scenes, has authentic characters dressed in native costumes speaking Welsh.  The story centers on the lighthouse and mysterious tales of a second ""phantom light"" from the mountains that lures ships to the rocks and their destruction.  Two lighthouse keepers have died under questionable circumstances, and the arrival of a new lighthouse keeper coincides with two disguised sleuths seeking to solve the mystery.  While not profound, it is an interesting look back into that time period.

It is the third movie which makes this DVD worthwhile.  In the Upturned Glass, a young James Mason stars as a neuro-surgeon who restores a child's eyesight and falls in love with her mother.  The affair ends and the mother mysteriously dies, falling out of a window.  The doctor begins his own investigation into the case, seeking revenge against the killer. The movie is gripping, as good as any modern suspense movie, with an unforgettable and startling ending.",1224979200,10,1719,5.081850533807829
3167718,4,B00177Y9WA,"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

8265171,5,B00177Y9WA,"If you like old British moview...the kind with crooks hiding in lighthouses and girls-next-door who somehow seem always to be running around in high heels and short shorts, you will love this DVD.  Also, particularly the Welsh thriller, provide a visual window in a time not so long ago, but culturally and technologically long past.",1438646400,3,333,5.054545454545455

8265174,5,B00177Y9WA,Very understated and entertaining films from the Brits. Acting talent abounds and these are a pleasure to watch. Stories are compelling.,1397260800,,136,5.523809523809524
8265175,5,B00177Y9WA,"Each of these marvelous entries wonderfully balance madcap comedy, history, and mystery. I'd like to think that whoever decided to place these different themes in a sampler did so wittingly. However, it was done and the set is worth the price and then some.",1392422400,,257,4.863636363636363
8265176,1,B00177Y9WA,I havn't watched the The Upturned Glass yet.  I was so disappointed with the other 2 films.  I LOVE old films but these are wooden performances without interesting story lines or chracter development. The Phantom Light has a couple scenes which are surprisingly scary but I didn't finish looking at it.  Red Ensign is more visual documentry about early 20th century ship building.  A real waste of money.,1357516800,,404,4.897058823529412
8265177,4,B00177Y9WA,"The Upturned Glass was the only really good movie in this collection. The viewer is led to believe that James Mason`s character is the upturned glass and that he is a paranoid madman.  However there is little to support his paranoia throughout the film.  There is another doctor whom I believe was describing himself along with James Mason as the upturned glass.  Dr. Farrell, as he is called, seemed to be a sociopath to my mind with no real social conscience and a total disregard for the hyppocratic oath.  Yet, in a somewhat pious attitude he declares himself as normal and sends Mason over the edge because Mason is suffering from  guilt feelings.  A paranoid person feels a since of persecution but this was not brought out in Mason`s character, unless I suppose he felt persecuted by Kate whom he suspected of killing the woman he loved. This being the case, the evidence was rather flimsy.  Movies tend to over dramatize mental illness and mental institutions for theatrical impact, giving a distorted picture and playing on the prejudice of the general public.  Hitchcock`s Spellbound  gave a more accurate description having consulted psychiatrists before hand.",1341187200,,1171,4.994845360824742
8265178,3,B00177Y9WA,"Bought this collection of 'thrillers' hoping for early British films that are similar to The Third Man but was sorely disappointed.

The Red Ensign is more of a propaganda puff piece for British shipbuilding.  They can get back on top if they only all work together and have faith.  Overly dramatic and poor plot.  Best parts of this film for me was the scenes flying over the shipyards and the ships under construction.

The Phantom Light is a delight in comparison, with lots of intelligent humor, period architecture, and quality writing, with a garbled ending that isn't very satisfying.

The Upturned Glass is likely the best in the bunch with excellent acting, script, plot, and production values.

If giving Red Ensign only one star and Upturned Glass four stars, I feel the average for the collection is three stars.  If looking for actual thrillers recommend The Third Secret, from 1964.  Although much newer it is an excellent example of psychological suspense with top quality performances from all.",1273017600,2,1010,5.0
8265179,1,B00177Y9WA,"The Red Ensign was not what I would call a thriller.  It was slow moving and unengaging.

The Phantom light had its moments- still not a real thriller.

The only highlight was the Upturned Glass.  Once again, not really a thriller but more a psychological study.

On the whole, borrow it from a friend if you have to see it.  It wouldn't be worth the price of renting or buying.",1254096000,,378,4.328571428571428
