The movie, itself is only two stars,but the way they keep you in the movie gives it a five.",1039996800,5,311,4.032258064516129
7828599,1,6302658519,"Have you ever seen a movie so sorry that you actually get a kick out of watching it over and over?  Well that's what you get with this one.  There was no real plot and many of the sequences were so stupid they were almost  unreal.  How can the police buy drugs from a crack house, letting them know  what's going on, yet they can't bust in until the exchange is made with the  supplier?  Ahhhh Hollywood.  Dialogue?  Forget it.  Take away the F word  and half the script is gone.  Feminists would have a field day with the  misogyny in this film, with scenes like Annie being raped, Melissa being  pushed into a scalding shower naked and when BT takes advantage of a drug  dazed Melissa.  In spite of it I find myself watching it again and again  for kicks, like video junk food.",963446400,7,779,4.2620689655172415
