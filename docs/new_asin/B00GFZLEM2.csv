8622698,4,B00GFZLEM2,"Legendary silent film actor Helen Holmes goes with railroad movies like peanut butter goes with jelly. She was the star of the mammoth silent railroad serial ""The Hazards of Helen"" in 1914-15 before branching off with her producer/director husband J. P. McGowen to make their own series of low budget, independent films.

The Helen Holmes DVDs that have been recently released by Alpha Video are all from the mid-1920's period where Helen starred in some short (less than an hour), very low budget programmers.  The DVDs from Alpha so far are: 1. ""The Lost Express;"" 2. ""Webs of Steel;"" 3. ""Perils of the Rail"" and ""Crossed Signals"" (a double feature on one DVD).

Of these three DVDs, ""Webs of Steel"" (1926) is the best as far as picture quality and, for the most part, with story and action. ""Webs of Steel"" centers around Helen, the daughter of a railroad supervisor, and her widowed father who has just made it big with a railroad company. He decides to leave the old, small family home and move into a big mansion.

Helen loves their old house next to the railroad line and wants to renovate it and keep it for herself. After all, she just might need a home of her own one day when she marries. Her father agrees and says she may keep the house.

Later, Helen is barreling along in her car down a country road when she plows into a wagon sitting in a blind curve. The owners of the wagon, a couple of crooks, attempt to rob Helen. Out of nowhere springs handsome, young John Andrews who trounces both men and saves Helen.  John is an out of work train engineer, and Helen asks her father to hire John to work for the railroad company.

John and Helen soon fall in love and want to get married, but one of Helen's former suitors has other plans. He wants to frame John for a railroad accident with another company and to get him fired from his new job.

""Webs of Steel"" contains several amazing stunts, all performed by Helen herself with no help from stunt personnel. In one scene she manages to save beautiful six-year-old child actor Lassie Lou Ahern from an on-coming train.  The child had walked onto a railroad bridge looking for her lost puppy. I won't spoil the rest of this scene by telling you how Helen saved the child, but it's astonishing to watch.

As far as picture quality, while far from being re-mastered, the film is watchable. I would grade it above average in comparison to most of the other Alpha DVDs of silent movies that are currently available, and the soundtrack is passable.

So if you are interested in a railroad adventure that moves along at a very fast 57 minutes starring the amazing Helen Holmes, then you might find this little film of interest.",1386720000,7,2684,4.536231884057971
