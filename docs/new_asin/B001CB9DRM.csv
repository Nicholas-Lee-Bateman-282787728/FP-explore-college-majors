8286428,1,B001CB9DRM,"I PURCHASED THE BOSS BR-600 DIGITAL RECORDER AND FOUND THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL VERY CONFUSING. JUST TO GET STARTED, THE MANUAL JUMPED AROUND, AT TIMES, 30 PAGES OR MORE INSTEAD OF PAGE BY PAGE INSTRUCTIONS, I THEN PURCHASED THE INSTRUCTIONAL CD AND FOUND THE INSTRUCTOR/ NARRATOR DOING THE SAME.  FRUSTRATED, I CONTACTED A TECH AT THE MANUFACTURERS HELP LINE, THE TECH WAS VERY HELPFUL, HE WALKED ME THROUGH THE INFORMATION THAT WAS NEEDED (STEP BY STEP).  THE EQUIPMENT IS GREAT, THE CD AND INSTRUCTION MANUAL NEED TO BE REWRITTEN IN A CONTINUOUS STEP BY STEP MANNER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION EQUIPMENT.

THE CD WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY, BOSS MUST REMEMBER, THIS EQUIPMENT IS USED BY MUSICIANS NOT COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO CALL THE HELP LINE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.

8286429,4,B001CB9DRM,"The Boss BR 600 is a neat (but far from perfect) machine, but if you are a newbie to recording, studio work, etc.  it can get very complicated to understand - also the BR 600's manuals are not great.

Actually the only reason I decided to buy a BR 600 instead of other similar digital recorders, is the availability of this video.  The video is very straight forward, simple and takes you through the BR 600s functions in a very clear and consecutive manner.  Also, the guy hosting this training is a very knowledgeable guy.  Not only does he get into the specifics of the BR 600, but also gives you tips for recording techniques in general.

I didn't give it a 5 star because the video is very specific and clear for the ""recording"" process, however when you get into the ""bouncing"" and ""mastering"" chapters, he rushes through with hardly any detail.  While we spend about 50 minutes in ""recording"" the ""bouncing and mastering"" steps are covered in less than 5 minutes - and these two steps are critical for getting the final product (song) as you want it to be.",1258588800,6,1063,4.505208333333333
