2714894,5,B000LVIZA0,"We recently upgraded from a regular DVD player to Blu Ray and were looking for HD video fireplaces. We had ordered several DVD's from World Nature Video in the past and were thrilled with the quality of the images, sound and variety, so we did not hesitate to order this DVD. We were once again impressed with the quality of the product. There is a very nice variety of fires which can be played consecutively or you can choose your favorite and run it on a loop. All have natural fireplace sounds which we prefer and the picture quality is outstanding. You will be very happy with any purchase you make from them. (Their aquarium DVD's are gorgeous too.)",1293321600,5,655,4.512605042016807
2714895,5,B000LVIZA0,I love fireplace DVD's and I own several. This is probably my favorite. Well filmed with a nice variety of scenes. It's like having a real fireplace in my room. I use a secondary T.V. to create atmosphere while watching movies or programs on another set. This DVD is the most realistic I have seen.,1220832000,4,298,4.4363636363636365
2714896,5,B000LVIZA0,The visual and sound were so realistic we felt like the room was getting warmer....:). No dust  & ashes to clean up. The fireplace DVD made for a cozy Christmas eve in our little condo.,1419638400,,185,4.285714285714286
2714897,5,B000LVIZA0,"This is ""THE ANSWER"" to having a fireplace without having to cut wood.  Couldn't ever talk my parents (or later, my husband) into having a fireplace.  Fireplace TV Jukebox CD has definitely made this 70 year old lady extremely happy.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone.",1417996800,,279,4.8936170212765955
2714898,5,B000LVIZA0,I bought this DVD for my wife. She is always wanting a fire for atmosphere but it is not always feasible. She was so excited about this DVD and has been watching it for years. I like having the crackling sounds in the background. The quality and sound are great.,1414886400,,262,4.26
2714899,5,B000LVIZA0,I absolutely love this Fireplace DVD.  There are so many fireplace scenes to choose from.  I play this disc almost continuously throughout the winter months.  It psychologically seems to make the house feel warmer...watching the flames and listening to the crackling.  I have a wood burning fireplace but rarely use it because it's so messy.  You will not be disappointed.  I would highly recommend this one.,1413936000,,408,5.106060606060606

2714901,5,B000LVIZA0,I bought three DVD's and tried them before ordering this one.  I am very satisfied with the Juke box DVD it looks and sounds very real and everyone who see's it are amazed at the realness of it. I showed it to my daughter who came from out of state to visit me and now she is going to order a copy when she get's back home.,1405468800,,323,3.8208955223880596
2714902,5,B000LVIZA0,"The DVD is great.  Have trouble sleeping sometimes so I put on the DVD and just let it play.  Nice, just like a real fire only no heat!",1394064000,,135,3.7857142857142856
2714903,5,B000LVIZA0,"Most people would agree that fires are equated with romance & relaxation. Thanks to the Ambient Collection from World Nature Vide, we have 2 DVD collections to achieve all the romance without the work. Safer & more accessible than a fire outdoors, sit back on your favorite rug or sofa & get all the benefits of a roaring fire.
 Fireplace Collection features 18 fires in one DVD collection. Although fires are ideal to warm up the body in these cold winter months, the subzero temperatures make it impossible to enjoy a relaxing, outdoor fire. No worries. All you need is a TV & DVD player. You won't worry about gloves or splinters as you choose between a roaring fire, a slow burning fire, or somewhere in the middle. Available via Amazon, this HD film brings not only the fire sights but the delightful, crackling sounds.
 Pick your favorite track to view or use the continuous play option for repetition. This particular Fireplace Collection combines Fireplace Jukebox Volumes 1 &2 in one convenient set.
 If a more scenic fire is what your heart desires, try Campfire on the Beach. From your favorite chair, you can view beautiful beach settings without worrying over whether fire-starting is permitted or whether theres enough dry wood. Enjoy the view from the UNESCO protected beaches of El Nido, Palawan, Philippines. Campfire contains 2 films of majestic sunsets & night scenes with the stars making their first appearances. For 80 tranquil minutes, youll be blessed with palliative waves & the sounds from the burning logs.

 I received the aforementioned products in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are mine.",1390435200,,1631,4.95970695970696

2714905,4,B000LVIZA0,The DVD worked very well.  Too bad I had to use my computer instead of the TV set--not your fault as my DVD played decided to break on New Year's Eve.,1388620800,,150,3.838709677419355
8164486,1,B000LVIZA0,Really loud. Didn't love it.,1496620800,,28,4.8
8164487,5,B000LVIZA0,"This product is super cool, and I love how many options it has for types of fires it produces. I would not recommend this product if you're wanting music to play as well because there isn't an option for that!",1478476800,,209,4.25
8164488,5,B000LVIZA0,Loved it as a way to fall asleep zzzzzzz,1468886400,,40,3.5555555555555554
8164489,4,B000LVIZA0,"Pretty good.  The video detail definition is very good.  One minor disappointment, however:  although there are many slightly different ""fires"" to choose from, most SEEM TO BE ""cropped"" such that what appears on my wide screen - in either direction - is smaller than the opening of whatever fireplace they recorded.
Only in one (1) version does the wood rack have a significant appearance at the bottom of my screen - this is the one that appears ""realistic"" to me, so regardless of other differences - in flame size and amount of crackling sounds - that is the only one I end up using.",1459036800,,586,4.615384615384615
8164490,5,B000LVIZA0,DVD arrived on time as promised. It is ever thing I was looking for. Picture is clear and sounds are delightful. I would recommend the duct and seller.,1448409600,,151,4.428571428571429

8164492,5,B000LVIZA0,"I own both of the Fireplace TV Jukebox DVDs and they are amazing.  Great variety with nine types of fire scenes to choose from.  There is the peaceful fire to the crackling blazing fire...one for any mood or activity from reading a book to providing background for your next party.  Quality sound, loop continuously, colorful realistic HD footage of fireplaces and fires.  Nice use for your television.  Add a fireplace scented candle for a total fireplace experience without the cleanup and carrying the logs.

This is a wonderful, relaxing video with lots of choice from music to sound effects, continuous play to individual track continuous play, to one of nine quality fire scenes.",1431129600,,685,5.017699115044247
