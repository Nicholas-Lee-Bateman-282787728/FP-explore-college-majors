4237685,3,B00402FGMG,"This is an awkward ""musicals"" collection as previous reviewers have noted, but the inclusion of 1989's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, not 2004's version of the Lloyd Webber musical, is downright misleading. The 1989 one in this set is a horror film with Robert Englund (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), made to capitalize on the musical's success in London and Broadway theatres, and the Leroux story's public domain status.",1323302400,21,412,5.073529411764706
4237686,3,B00402FGMG,"The box is okay but some of the disks are two sided and it is hard to read the very small print in the middle of the disk.
But for all that the movies have been remastered as best as they can be as some of them are 60 years old? or more.
All in all a good box set with some hard to find musicals in it.",1311724800,6,302,3.4558823529411766
4237687,1,B00402FGMG,"many of these films are not from mgm/amazons description of 10 dvds is simply wrong /most of the discs were inconveniently double-sided-only saddest music-not a musical, and a chorus line on their own discs/you cant get a worse package than this",1304121600,3,245,5.0
4237688,1,B00402FGMG,"Had I not received this set as a gift I certainly wouldn't be inclinced to purchase it. With everything that MGM has produced it is totally amazing the poor representation of that work collected here. ""A Chorus Line"" is (was) a totally wonderful experience in the theatre and a complete disaster as a movie and the same is true for ""Phantom of the Opera"". And who, in their right mind, would include the Sandra Bernhard movie in any collection let alone one for supposedly great musicals? Review the titles offered in this set and see if you can't purchase individual copies of the ones that you really want to own for less - if not then buy the set and donate the less important titles to the Goodwill.",1292544000,5,703,4.5
4237689,1,B00402FGMG,"With all the Musical movie not yet on DVD, They release the same old trash. Why not ""Athena""""The Merry Widow"", ""RoseMarie""and Mario Lanza films ""The Student Prince""""The Great Caruso""etc. ?

Very Funny

8411666,5,B00402FGMG,I was looking for a copy of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum that would play in Region 1 and that didn't cost a fortune. This fit the bill and I got 9 extra movies to boot.,1390435200,2,186,3.5609756097560976
8411667,5,B00402FGMG,"I wanted ""A Song is Born"" and it was only available from sellers asking an outrageous amount... Bought this for that movie but enjoyed many others on this dvd, too.

I like old movies and this has been a joy to watch. Everyone should get a copy.

8411672,5,B00402FGMG,"You can buy ""A Song is Born"" new here at Amazon for $70.00 and free shipping.  I bought this ten-pack, which included a perfect copy of ""A Song is Born"", and paid $4.99, plus three bucks shipping from an Amazon Seller.

Most of you know this, but ""A Song is Born"" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is essentially a clever, Big Band-era remake of ""Ball of Fire"".  I had ""Ball of Fire"" (which is also very expensive to buy new), but wanted ""A Song is Born"" to round out the ""set"".  Each movie is charming, but perhaps ""Ball of Fire"" is a little better, mostly because of Barbara Stanwyck. Danny Kaye is excellent in ""A Song is Born"" however, and much more aptly cast in the starring role of the lead ""professor"" than Gary Cooper was in ""Ball of Fire"".  Interestingly, Howard Hawks directed BOTH of these movies.

If I never watch any of the other nine features in this set, I'm way ahead of the game.  Just a thought for those of you who weren't born wealthy.  Cheers!",1343001600,15,969,4.344444444444444
