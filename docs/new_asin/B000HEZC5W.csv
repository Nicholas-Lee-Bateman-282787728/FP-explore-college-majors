2637039,5,B000HEZC5W,After watching this with all the kids I would recommend any of the my little ponies dvds. It is something I would feel comfortable about letting the kids watch all the time and I would not have to worry...,1353110400,,205,4.282051282051282
2637040,5,B000HEZC5W,My daughter loves this movie. She is almost 3 and loves my old My Little Ponies. She was so excited when this came in the mail for her. The colors are so bright and beautiful. The story lines are sweet and simple. Nothing scary to skip over!!,1321920000,,242,4.170212765957447
2637041,5,B000HEZC5W,"I grew up watching the older generation MLP, and loved the varied story lines in each episode, with its collection of villains. Unfortunately, my 6.5-year-old does not care for the older MLP shows:( She finds the villains too gross and the ponies do not appeal to her. I think she is attracted to the newer generation ponies because of their cute manga-like features (as seen on the Hub channel).

She did like this DVD though because of its charming storyline. Ponyville is hosting the spring parade and Wysteria is all excited. Then things get even more exciting when Wysteria awakens Spike (who does not look anything like the Spike on the new series, just a little griping from my daughter), a cute little dragon. According to legend, when a dragon is brought out of slumber, a new princess will be crowned, so the question is, who will be the Princess of Ponyville?

The DVD has several extra features:
Pinkie Pie's Lady Bug Jamboree (animated short)
Bonus Episode : A Charming Birthday
Sing-A-Longs - ""Breezie Blossom"" and ""A Princess is in Town""
Five original songs

The show is in full screen format, dolby digital, with English 5.1 surround, and is in color, with a running time of 70 mins.",1317081600,,1199,4.7548076923076925
2637042,5,B000HEZC5W,These movies are wonderful for watching over and over again. My girls just LOVE them!,1285545600,,85,4.733333333333333
2637043,5,B000HEZC5W,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves My Little Pony.  She loves this movie and watches it over and over. It's adorable to hear her singing along.  She also has a Very Minty Christmas and was thrilled that Minty is also in this movie.  I like that it is just a nice, happy movie she can enjoy without being too scary and it does not contain any adult humor or issues.  I did not grow up playing with My Little Pony, but I am glad I have found them for her.",1272240000,,451,3.923076923076923
2637044,5,B000HEZC5W,I couldn't find a my little pony movie anywhere so I was very happy to find it here. My daughter loved it when she opened it for her birthday.,1264377600,,142,3.9310344827586206
2637045,5,B000HEZC5W,My 5 yr old  absolutely loves this movie.  We really need to buy it because we rent it every few weeks and she watches it like a child possessed.  It's definately going on her Christmas list.,1259452800,,191,4.25
2637063,4,B000HEZC5W,"Totally exceeded expectations, instant favorite for my daughter, hard for an adult to sit through, drags a bit.",1255910400,,111,5.222222222222222
2637064,4,B000HEZC5W,"My daughter, who is almost 5, is a big ""MLP"" fan.  She wanted a MLP video for a while and was so excited to receive ""Princess Promenade"".  When I read about the product, I understood that the video was 70 minutes long, and I was under the impression that ""Princess Promenade"" was the only movie on the DVD. It turns out that ""Princess Promenade is only one of two ""episodes"" on the DVD.  There is another video about a Pony Birthday party on the DVD.  Each episode is about 30 minutes long.  There also is a cute short video too.  If your child is a MLP fan, this video will not disappoint.",1252713600,,590,4.223214285714286
2637065,5,B000HEZC5W,"Perfect movie for my 2 and 4 year old daughters who are into everything princess.  I don't mind that they watch movies like this, that are very sweet, no name calling.",1251072000,,167,4.387096774193548
2637066,4,B000HEZC5W,"As an older My Little Pony fan, I'm glad that the next generation can love the new versions as much as I did. This was a gift for a friend's 5 year-old daughter, and I was very pleased that she thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It has kept her entertained time and again.",1250294400,,267,4.153846153846154
2637067,5,B000HEZC5W,This is another great animated My Little Pony Video.  It is well written and has good songs too.  My 3 and 6 year old daughters love watching it.  I think it was money well spent.  I wish they wouldn't have stopped producing these videos.,1236470400,,238,4.340909090909091
2637068,4,B000HEZC5W,"My daughter's favorite video by far. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i cannot stand the pony that says ""dahling"" every 5 seconds. Very annoying to listen to!",1223078400,,170,4.34375
2637069,4,B000HEZC5W,"Surprisingly, the main feature, altho cute, was not the favorite with my 2 year old daugter.  Her favorite was the second feature, A Charming Birthday, with her fav Minty heading up the cast of the Little Ponies search for how to present the perfect b-day present for Kimono! All in all the videos are very enjoyable....the ponies are always fun and their show of love and compassion are always a bonus!!",1217376000,,404,4.690140845070423
2637070,4,B000HEZC5W,My Daughter really enjoyed this for Christmas. It was a big hit.,1168473600,,64,4.416666666666667
2637071,5,B000HEZC5W,MY GRANDAUGHTER COLLECTS MY LITTLE PONIES. THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF MANY SHE HAS AND SHE NEVER TIRES OF WATCHING THEM ALL. NICE MOVIE FOR MY LITTLE PONY FANS,1168473600,,153,4.310344827586207
2637072,5,B000HEZC5W,"These are the first My Little Pony movies that my 4-year-old daughter has seen and she loves them.  Since the ponies are magical, they fit right in with her imagination at this age and the stories also have some morals to them that she can understand.  I am very glad that I purchased the set.",1168387200,,293,4.3090909090909095
2637085,5,B000HEZC5W,"That cover art does not do this movie justice.

Okay, so I went to my neighbor's house to watch his kids for a while so him and his wife could go watch Snakes on a Plane without their daughters freaking out everytime the snake jumps out. (That movie pales in comparision to this, by the way.)

I let them watch one of their DVDs and they put this in and told me I had to watch it. I thought it was going to be one of those campy direct to video things (I must've missed when it was in theaters or something) and the animation just blew me away. Not only that, but there are some great actors in that movie. The story was beautiful and touching and the dialogue is some of the most natural I've heard in a long time.

Do not miss this movie. If it looks like everything is all cutesy, you have the wrong movie. Get the real version. The one that's going to be nominated for practically everything.",1156118400,,896,4.137931034482759
2637086,5,B000HEZC5W,Cute movie my daughter loves to watch this - I enjoyed it too. MAG,1155081600,,66,3.7857142857142856
2637087,3,B000HEZC5W,The video is an excellent addition to someone's little pony collection.  My daughter watched it several times singing along and acting out different parts.,1153267200,,155,5.458333333333333
2637088,3,B000HEZC5W,"My 2-3 year old girl adores this DVD, she loves ponys at the moment and My little Pony Princess Promenade seems to be the only thing she wants to see - even my 4 year old likes it.

There are three stories in one, in ponyville they have discovered a dragon called Spike under the castle - Wysteria has picked the flower he was growing and so she is now the Princess of Ponyville and spike must protect her - or course thereis nothing to protect her from.

Then there is the Princess Promenade - a spring parade where all the ponys build floats.

Finally there is the Birthday where all the pony's make a charm for a charm bracelet (all dependent on the colour and type of pony they are of course.

Kind of innocuous fun - there are songs on it which my girls enjoy. The plot is not at all complex - and although I don't know if the girls really understand the plot anyway, they enjoy the colour, the songs, the simple animation and the simple set up scenes.

As an adult I don't really enjoy this, it is just too innocuous. There is little in here to really enjoy, however if my kids were rating this it would be a solid 5 - for me it is a 3 - they like it, I find it too unstructured and badly written, badly voiced to be a really good movie which we will enjoy for years.",1152403200,,1273,4.076
2637089,5,B000HEZC5W,"When I first tracked down a copy of this film on eBay, I was a bit skeptical. Would the film live up to the hype? Could a film with this many popular voice actors actually be INSPIRED? Would this animated movie, in fact, change the way we'll watch films from now on? Just 10 minutes into the film, I realized the answers to these questions were ""Yes"", ""Yes"", and ""Ultrayes"".

Never before have I seen so much emotion in an animated film.... or even in a live-action film. Finally someone

took advantage of the medium to create a work of art that surpasses the quality, the craftsmanship, and the action-packed beauty of lively live-action films.

There are layers. Indescribable layers of depth. The characters, each change of frame, each bit of dialog, and every aspect of the film seems to be symbolic -- bleeding effortlessly into each other, into the diaphragm of the American Dream. The gong of creativity has been gonged. The beacon has been lit. How much longer will the fiery fires

flame? In the world we live in today, it is important that films such as ""My Little Poney: The Princess Promenade"" are made.

So many others have said it better, yet it seems no one has been able to say it at all. Perhaps it is best to quote the movies final lines?

""We must climb, Florence. We must climb. With the ocean below us, circling like so many memories.... memories of the past. This ocean will engulf our hope, our bodies, our memories of the past, but it'll never engulf our will to climb. So climb we must. Climb into each other.... into the sunset of our dreams. The princess saw it. Mr. Green saw it, too. It is our time, though. And what is time? But a measurement! Climb we must, dear Florence..... Climb we must.""

Beautiful.",1141689600,,1736,4.527156549520766
2637090,5,B000HEZC5W,"I love this movie! Zipzee's sneezes were cute, but at first, one of the Breezies shout that she will sneeze when she smells the flower and be sick! She was not sick during the end like in Sesame Street Kids Favorite Songs 2, the meatball from the ""On Top Of Spaghetti"" song, Elmo almost got flattend by the meatball. The scene where Spike says he'll kiss Pinkie Pie, he says it's like in Snow White and the seven little guys.",1140825600,,425,4.325
2637091,4,B000HEZC5W,"I have been a My Little Pony fan since they first came out in the 80's. And I have been collecting the newest generation of ponies and MLP-themed merchandise to add to my old collection.

I have all the cartoons and movies so far from G3, and the first few were quite corny IMHO, but they got progressively better.

The Princess Promenade has a good story line that kept even me (a 26-year-old woman lol) interested to see what happens next. The animation quality was well-done (except for expected little mistakes here and there) the songs were not annoying like most other cartoon singing, and the characters were very likeable.

The only thing still lacking in the G3 movies is some kind of enemy. My favorite episodes from the 80's were the pilot and special which had very well-done bad guys while still not being 'violent'. I think adding a few darker characters would add alot of contrast and interest to the storylines.

One thing that disappointed me in Princess Promenade was 'Spike the Dragon'. I remember Spike in the 80's as a cute, scruffy-voiced baby dragon with such a great character to him. I do not like the way he was drawn in this film, or his 'proper' personality. I miss the good ol' 80s Spike. So that was why I gave it 4 instead of 5- Spike was a favorite character of mine in the old cartoons, and it was upsetting to see how they changed him. But it was still a great film, and those who are new to MLP won't notice or care about the change.

The previous G3 film 'A Very Minty Christmas' is also very cute, so check that out as well.

I look forward to the next film when we finally have unicorns- especially since that probably means there'll be unicorn MLP toys released as well!",1140134400,,1709,4.444089456869009
2637092,5,B000HEZC5W,"The quality and story line of this DVD overall are MUCH improved over previous G3 animated films. The music was also great!  (there was still the usual pony mix-ups in animation though -- pegasus ponies missing their wings throughout most of the film, etc) But overall it is very enjoyable!

Really looking forward the new upcoming movie ""THE RUNAWAY RAINBOW"" due out Fall 2006, featuring UNICORNS!! ;) There is a preview for the new movie on this DVD.

We bought our DVD at Superstore, it was only $13.00 CDN and came with a free ""Bonus My Little Pony Wrist Wrap"", which is quite adorable!

So, no idea why Amazon.ca is charging so much money for this DVD -- and saying it takes 4-6 weeks is crazy, considering it was released in stores across the city on February 7!!

Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD to any MLP fan, or for children.",1139961600,,839,4.529801324503311
2637093,5,B000HEZC5W,"This is yet another very cute Little Pony production.  It has just about everything little girls love:  rainbow colors, cute ponies with big pretty eyes having parties, exchanging gifts, and playing a lot - my daughter has watched this about five times in the last three days, so, there's proof of its appeal.  I know there will come a time when she no longer watches these, but I hope I always remember how her face looked when she did.",1139702400,,437,4.506329113924051
8139483,4,B000HEZC5W,"This DVD contains ""A Charming Birthday"" and ""The Princess Promenade"", the first and fifth releases in the direct-to-video ""Generation 3"" My Little Pony series.

MLP G3 is set in a world where there is very little danger, and ponies almost always get along with one another; as such it will primarily appeal to very young children. Despite this, the writing is fairly good, with fun characters and a lot of clever dialog. The art is so bright and colorful it may overwhelm some adults, but its also well done.

""A Charming Birthday"" features some very amusing dialog, and some low-key conflict between characters (very unusual for this series). Unfortunately, the plot is often broken up by long-winded introductions to the characters.

""The Princess Promenade"" takes the time to examine the fantasy of becoming a princess, and illustrates in a child-friendly way why being royalty isn't always as fun as one might imagine. The resolution of the story however feels like a bit of a cop-out, and doesn't fully adress the issues raised.

I would reccomend this DVD for very young children, and anyone who likes both bright colors and stories with little conflict.",1442102400,,1160,4.994818652849741

8139491,5,B000HEZC5W,Love this DVD; so does Aubrey.  We watch it over and over. I think I like the old My Little Pony for her age group more than the new My Little Pony shows.  They seem targeted to younger children.,1381104000,,195,3.9743589743589745
