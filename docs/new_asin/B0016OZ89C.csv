3162644,4,B0016OZ89C,"This DVD featuring 10th dan black belt Hirokazu Kanazawa performing much of the Shotokan katas is nothing short of amazing. An inspiration to any karateka studying the forms. Kanazawa really is a great master! However, this particular DVD is in the PAL format ( not readily viewable in the US) and my Toshiba DVD recorder (fairly new) will not play this disk, nor will my JVC or Sony. The only way I could watch it was on my computer. I would have given this DVD 5 stars if not for the format problem. Still worth the purchase to me but this should be sold in the US in the NTSC format as most machines will simply not play it.",1240617600,10,627,4.277310924369748
3162645,1,B0016OZ89C,"I think this series is great. See my review of Kanazawa's 26 Kata DVD in this same series.

So imagine how much I wanted to receive this dvd and watch it.

So imagine how much I was irritated when AMAZON ADVERTISED THIS AS AN NTSC FORMAT DVD and delivered A PAL FORMAT DVD, which won't play on any of my machines.

Amazon has never let me down before. So I returned the dvd and reordered, figuring that they'd send me the correct item.

TWICE.

I'm now looking at the third PAL format dvd that Amazon has sent me and I'm frustrated in the extreme.

And it's clear that Amazon has goofed this up royally, and can't find a way to fix it.

So I'll find some other seller and buy from it.

But BUYER BEWARE on this one. Sadly.

Kanazawa was the winner of the first All-Japan Karate Tournament, and his skills at this point in his life were amazing. His all-26-kata dvd is the best value in Shotokan Kata DVDS, period.

But Amazon has now had three chances to send me the NTSC format version of the Kumite dvd that you're looking at, and they've sent me the PAL version all three times.

UPDATE: I finally ordered this an the companion kihon dvd from Turtle Press. Their PAL format dvds could be played on my computer. Frankly, this series is so good that if you have to play them on your pocket calculator, it's worth having them.

This is the least important dvd in the series, but it's nice for completeness. It teaches the non-freestyle sparring exercises that lead up to freestyle sparring in Shotokan Karate, and you couldn't ask for a better teacher. Obviously, you can't learn Shotokan Karate from a dvd, but this series provides the student or prospective student with a great roadmap of what you'll be doing in class if you study with a realdeal teacher of Shotokan.",1224115200,2,1771,4.4489164086687305
3162646,5,B0016OZ89C,"This dvd is about as good as it gets in the kata department.

This presents all 26 of the Shotokan Kata. But it's not just any presenter. The presenter here is Kanazawa, the winner of the first All-Japan Karate Tournament. He is a legend, and here he's at his physical prime, so his presentation of the kata is robust and precise.
I generally like to say something bad in my reviews, because that give a review a little more appearance of balance.

But...guys! This is ONE dvd. With ALL of the Shotokan Kata. In perfect form and timing! And it costs nickels and dimes! Okay, there's one thing. This dvd doesn't address the bunkai for the kata.

But it's not a bunkai dvd! It's a kata dvd! This one is for sequence of timing and perfection of the techniques. For bunkai, you'll want the series bunkai-jutsu by Iain Abernethy.

If you're a beginner in Shotokan and want to see where you can go if you're very talented, have a great teacher (Nakayama,for instance), and work very hard, this is a combination roadmap and destination signpost.

If you're an experienced Shotokan student of many years standing, you have here a remarkable achievement: a one-stop source for all your kata reference.

In terms of production quality, price to value ratio, quality of content, quality of presenter, and overall great value, this is the single best kata dvd I've ever seen. And I have hundreds of martial arts dvds, with a good number of those devoted to kata.

Putting it a different way, you can always buy twenty or twelve or five dvds to get the same data in a slightly different (and probably inferior) package.

But why would you?",1224115200,3,1626,4.641114982578397

8263827,5,B0016OZ89C,"This DVD is great for practicing your katas at home when you don't have your sensei to correct you. The 17 katas on this DVD are shown twice from different angles and there is a brief demonstration showing how the moves would be used against an opponent. Since the footage is older the quality is not the best, it looks like it was made in the late 1980's or early 1990's, but the content is fantastic so I still have it 5 stars. There were some people in other reviews saying it didn't work in their DVD players I didn't seem to have that problem.

8263834,5,B0016OZ89C,"""Shotokan Karate KATA"" with Kancho Hirokazu Kanazawa 10 Dan (DVD)

Hirokazu Kanazawa is the only living 10th Dan Shotokan Master.  He is undoubtedly one of the greatest Shotokan  masters who, along side Master Masatoshi Nakayama, trained directly under Grandmaster Gichin Funakoshi.  Soke Kanazawa shows excellent technique. Timing, speed and power are superbly seen in his optimal performances of these Kata.  This DVD is  E S S E N T I A L  for all practitioners of Shotokan Karate-Do.  Especially for those beginners needing to achieve the correct form.",1380326400,2,556,5.238636363636363

8263836,4,B0016OZ89C,"This is an excellent video that presents the kata in a very complete and comprehensive way. It is the kind of quality I've come to expect from Kancho Kanazawa's training materials. It's also well produced, and easy to follow. I really like that bunkai is also presented with each kata. The only drawback, and the only reason that I didn't give this video 5 stars is because it does NOT present all 26 katas of the Shotokan cirriculum, it only presents 17 katas. Amazon does not provide this information in the product description, yet has allowed another reviewer to incorrectly state that 26 katas are presented in this video. In my opinion that review should be redacted, or withdrawn by Amazon.com.",1298505600,8,701,4.801652892561983
