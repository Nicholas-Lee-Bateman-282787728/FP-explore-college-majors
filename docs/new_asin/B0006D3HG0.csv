2181969,4,B0006D3HG0,"This was silly fun -- although a bit scary for the younger (3-year-old) set.  What a hoot!  Teri Garr, Adam West, along with ""the gang"" are having fun, and it shows.  Plus, who wouldn't love the Hawaiian backdrop?  My only complaint is that Daphne is turning into Barbie -- the ""it"" girl who can do everything and doesn't need the rest of the gang.  If you can ignore this flagrant disregard of the ensemble genre, you will enjoy finding Velma in the face of the gecko!  Vintage-style silliness with a little extra edge.",1112313600,4,520,4.537634408602151
2181970,1,B0006D3HG0,This Scooby-Doo VHS is ABSOULTY HORRIBLE!! It lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the Scooby-Doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises...too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like....Plus its higher cost I paid 9.95 TRUST ME BUY Scooby-Doo 2 or Scooby-Doo Cyber Chase Those keep the kids glued to the T.V. very exciting Just the way we want Scooby Doo to be!!!,1111881600,,422,4.875
2181971,5,B0006D3HG0,"Huge Scooby Doo fan.  Any Scooby Doo DVD release is heavily anticipated by my kids.  Some of their movie choices are difficult to watch but not this one.

Aloha has a good story and continues to develope the great characters by continuing to  make Daphne smarter and more resourceful rather than the ""dumb,accident-prone, pretty one"" like the 60's show.

Overall a very good addition to the series and our collection.",1109203200,14,417,4.9

2182006,5,B0006D3HG0,"Surf's Up for Scooby and the gang, It's Scooby Doo - how can you go wrong?",1469750400,,74,3.6875
2182007,3,B0006D3HG0,"Released in 2005, ALOHA SCOOBY-DOO is the eighth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the homemarket.

In this adventure, Daphne has won an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii for the gang.  Their paradise turns sour when popular surfing resort Hanahuna is suddenly attacked by the demonic minions of the Wiki-Tiki, an island spirt that seems to have taken offense at a surfing contest that has been recently opened to mainlander contestants.  Scooby-Doo features often bring up ecological issues, and this one may be the most obvious: suspicions fall on a mayor and a real estate agent who seem to be working in tandem to pave paradise and put up, if not a parking lot, at least a time-share type condo.  But how would the very people who are trying to sell out the town of Hanahuna benefit from frightening prospective buyers away?

Scooby-Doo mysteries aren't on the same level as an Agatha Christie novel, but they usually make a better showing than ALOHA SCOOBY-DOO, in which the culprits become very obvious about mid-way through the story.  That aside, however, its all good fun with a song performed by Don Ho and a characters voiced by Teri Garr and Adam West.  ALOHA SCOOBY-DOO may not be the best of the Scooby-Doo featuresit isn't quite as imaginative as the best of the bestbut its still entertaining.  Recommended.

2182162,4,B0006D3HG0,"Since Warner revamped the Scooby-Doo franchise in 1998, the feature length mysteries have been inconsistent. The first few had real monsters, with no rubber masks, but far too many disgustingly PC mommies in America complained and the Brothers Warner folded and went back to the ""guy in a suit to scare away the locals"" stories. A shame.

What a surprise then that Scooby's 2005 adventure is actually quite good, despite its PC shortcomings. This time around the Mystery Inc. gang are in Hawaii, catching some rays and relaxation. Typically, this is the exact moment the local volcano starts brewing over and a big monster called the Wiki-Tiki rears its ugly head, scaring away all of the surfers from the Hanahuna resort and kidnapping a local babe. If you are incredibly sad, like me, you will realize this is a little too much like the 1970 episode, A Tiki Scare Is No Fair.

The usual long list of suspects includes a sleazy real estate agent, an ambitious mayor, and an eccentric holiday rep (Adam West). And just as soon as their mystery-solving begins, the real culprit is immediately noticeable. It's a poorly written whodunit, but what saves it are crazy set pieces and a varied atmosphere, which keep the mystery interesting, if obvious. Or, at least, obvious to a 30-year-old. It may well come as a surprise to an eight-year-old.

Locations, such as the beach, the deep jungle, the catacombs and Auntie Mahina's cabin, are beautifully animated. The best thing about the modern Scooby is that production values are a zillion times what the original 1969 series was. Aloha, Scooby-Doo looks incredibly slick and the eye-popping color schemes would keep you interested no matter how poor the mystery was.

One could accuse the film of being slightly stereotypical in regards to its Hawaiian setting. But it's no worse than the unrealistic Scotland seen in 2004's Scooby-Doo And The Loch Ness Monster.

I was also surprised at how little of it actually relies on Scooby (voiced by Frank Welker, who also does Fred). He barely gets a chance to do his thing. Most of the laughs come from the rest of the gang. But, as it is, Aloha, Scooby-Doo is still loads of fun and proves that while the story quality of modern Scoobys remains inconsistent, the animation just gets better and better.

The Blu Ray features a lovely 1.78:1 1080p picture bursting with colors that pop off the screen and a decent DTS HD-MA soundtrack. Extras are minimal and are in standard definition.",1309910400,4,2475,4.8530805687203795

The volcano god is angry, however, and people start to disappear as a result. Of course, it's all just a scam on the part of the bad guys to scare people off their land so it can be purchased at discount prices because being a surfing champ doesn't pay very well. When the volcano god sends its minions on yet another raid, Scooby and the gang discover that animatronics and rocket science do mix.

This is another in the new animated Scooby-Doo movies and is far superior to the old animated series. It also features music by Don Ho. If you like Scooby-Doo you'll want to add this to your collection. It appeals to kids and adult fans alike.",1191369600,4,789,4.479166666666667

I decided to try Scooby Doo and started with the Aloha one as I live at the beach and knew he could relate somewhat- WOW - was I surprised to see that not only did it keep his attention, he learned new words and phrases that are mindful of children his age, it's full of fun & excitement, and further, he now understands that ""Wickie Tickie"" Monsters are just ""pretend"" as the film explains in the end. This puts an end to the hum-drum videos our children are subjected to just because someone else says certain videos are not ""age appropriate"".  Let your children experience some fun!

2182186,3,B0006D3HG0,"The best way to begin is to show you where I stand. I think ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island"" and ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost"" were the best. In my opinion, ""Scooby Doo and the Alien Invasion"" and ""Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase"" were kind of on the mediocre side. ""Legend of the Vampire"" was a really good return to form. ""Monster of Mexico"" was on the decent side. I couldn't really get into ""Loch Ness Monster."" This 8th chapter was pleasantly surprising. It starts with the gang innocently going to Hawaii on yet another vacation. And AS USUAL they discover another mystery while on vacation. Interestingly, in this one case they have deal with some slight bigotry. ('The mainlanders') Scooby and Shaggy are still ofcourse after any available meal. There is some well placed suspense as well as misleads and comical characters along the way. (Listen for a cameo appearance by Adam West-Batman.) You'll probably also recognize Terri Garr. I can't say too much without spoiling the movie, but I will say in the spirit of Scooby Doo, the surprises behind the 'secret plots' are well placed, and we realize that they make sense upon discovery. And ofcourse, we'll be laughing along the way as well. My only real complaint is that in this chapter Fred's leadership and control of the situation and Velmah's looking at things from the research lab is starting to give way to Daphne handling most of the situation herself. That said, this 8th chapter lacks the power and intensity of ""Scooby Doo on Zombie Island"" and ""The Witch's Ghost."" And I can't quite put it up there with ""Legend of the Vampire."" But all in all, it is a good 8th chapter that has some good laughs and is worth owning.",1112486400,9,1689,4.6521739130434785
