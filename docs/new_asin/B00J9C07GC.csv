6371680,3,B00J9C07GC,"An Excellent demo of how advanced CGI effects can replicate tornados but thats about it.  Cool effects do not make for a good film, but if you are facinated by tornadoes (which I always have been since the OZ tornado) and you like the movie ""Twister"" you will like this movie for sure.  Its more or less a docu drama of what happens to a small town bombarded by tornadoes on graduation day.

Nothing more, nothing less than a showcase for tornadoes and their overwhelming power....",1408233600,,481,4.569767441860465
6371681,4,B00J9C07GC,"The film opens with two subplots. We see the world's worse storm chasers as they haven't been able to film a storm in a year. Running out of funds, they have a chance for one last shoot. While everyone is converging on Riverside, our crew heads to Silverton. In Silverton we see the everyday people being interviewed for a 25 year time capsule at graduation time.

This isn't too hard to figure out as the goal of the storm chaser is to film the eye of an EF-infinity tornado, but in this case they must also warn the town folks that regular storm shelters are going to be ineffective against what is headed their way.

The storm chasers drive two vehicles. The armor piercing proof Titus which uses gallons per mile...and a blue stretch van that might as well be a target. Much of the film is shown through the annoying hand held camera, a cheap way to build character and make me dislike the film. The storm sequences were done rather well. The heavy bass sound vibrated the floor for an added effect. The storm scenes kept the intensity factor high for a long time. Special effects better than the script and actors.

Worth a view if you don't mind watching some home movies too.

6371682,4,B00J9C07GC,"What happens when you combine CGI, ""found footage"" video, and the revival of the disaster film craze that enveloped the cinema during the 1970s? This is where INTO THE STORM comes into play.

Set during a turbulent spring in the Midwest, the film depicts a professional group of storm chasers, led by Matt Walsh and Sarah Wayne Callies, who thus far have had no luck in getting close to any real tornadoes in the previous two years.  This time, though, their ""luck"" changes when they find an extremely violent cold front is barreling through the midsection of the United States, and conditions are forming for a record formation of tornadoes.  The crew hightail it for the small Oklahoma town of Silverton, where they see monstrous super storm cells starting to form over the open plains on all sides of town.  At the same time, however, the town is also seeing off a lot of its kids for graduation at the high school; and unfortunately, the school, the town, and everybody in it are in the sights of these supercells.  Walsh is so desperate to get the footage on film that he will put himself and those around him at risk, something that truly alienates Callies, an experienced meteorologist, no end.  But instead of just merely filming and documenting the twisters, the team find themselves rescuing many townspeople, including the high school vice-principal (Richard Armitage) and the students when six different twisters touch down and ravage much of the town.  And then in the end, they are confronted with a three mile-wide monster tornado with winds in its center approaching a mind-busting three hundred miles per hour.

The entire premise of INTO THE STORM is a good one, given that Midwestern towns like Moore, Oklahoma and Joplin, Missouri were each nearly wiped clean off the map by monstrous tornadoes during the typical season for these storms at the height of spring, when cold, dry air funneling out of Canada collides with the warm, humid air coming northward from the Gulf of Mexico.  If this premise had been followed through with the same kind of care as the creation of the computer-generated twisters had been, what we might have had here was a truly frightening film along the lines of the 1996 Jan DeBont-directed film TWISTER, which this strongly resembles and which it will inevitably be compared to.

But even with all that great CGI on display, there are three things that keep INTO THE STORM from reaching the level of TWISTER.  The first is that not enough time is taken to really draw realistic characters out of the main principals involved, though Callies and Carey (the latter as one of the Silverton teens caught up in the super destruction of the town) do good turns.  The second is the excessive use on the part of both director Steven Quale (FINAL DESTINATION 5) and writer John Swetnam (who wrote, among other things, the screenplay for the 2013 horror film EVIDENCE) to rely on the ""found footage"" and high school student ""time capsule"" things, since it blunts the edge the film might have had over other summer blockbusters.  And I really think the film could have done better without the appearance of a couple of extremely irritating and stereotypical redneck wanna-be storm chasers (Kyle David; Jon Reep).

Absent the aforementioned flaws, the comparisons to TWISTER, which benefited from good performances by Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, would not seem to be quite as unfavorable as this review appears to be.  Still, INTP THE STORM, when it focuses in on the storm chasers, the townspeople, and the super storms themselves, works with almost the same degree of success as TWISTER.  It is a fairly typical summer blockbuster film, of course, relying, perhaps a bit excessively, on creating spectacular disaster scenes instead of giving us more in the way of characters.  But as many other such blockbusters rely even less, or almost not at all, on things as important as plot and character, INTO THE STORM is far from a total bust.",1407974400,,3975,4.847858197932053
6371683,4,B00J9C07GC,"I love disaster movies and I very much enjoyed the movie.  Disaster movies generally start with a good bit of introductory footage, where you learn about the characters, their strengths and weaknesses, and sub-plots going on with a couple of them.  The introductory phase makes you feel like you know the people and ""feel"" for their predicaments and situation, and your emotions are intensified at the end of the movie by sub plots like an estranged couple getting back together, or whatever.  While there was a little bit of sub plot, there just didn't seem to be a whole lot, so the strong emotions were not there as intensely as other disaster movies.

That said, the storms were intense, culminating to a big whopper tornado.  The CGI was great.  The movie was mainly the storms, which I enjoyed.  I just thought the movie needed to touch my heart a little more.",1407801600,38,866,4.695364238410596
6371684,5,B00J9C07GC,"Into The Storm is about a normal day that turns into an extraordinary day in the town of Silverton (I don't recall a state being given). We meet various characters. Some crazy drunks doing videos for YouTube; like attempting jumping across a pool on fire. A group of stormchasers led by meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne-Callies) and ornery Pete (Matt Walsh) who are struggling to catch tornadoes. A high school vice principal Gary (Richard Armitage) and his sons, Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress), and their strained relationship.  You can tell Gary loves his sons but is having a hard time letting them know.  There's also a high school graduation that day as well. It's just a regular day until the tornadoes arrive with almost little warning.

This film is nicely done. I was concerned that the special effects would be cheesy, like the SyFy channel, which is fun to watch sometimes (and no global warming conspiracy theories here - Thank You, Steven Quale!!) but the special effects were very good! The storms looked realistic (I'm from the Midwest and have lived with severe weather; I always enjoy watching the sky, LOL).  Though I'm sure a tornado wouldn't catch fire (this IS a movie after all), the effect was really cool.  There has to be some interesting twists in a movie!

There are touching moments; ie, Donnie' s speech to the camera set off tears among my friends (it couldn't have been an easy scene to shoot and I applaud Max Deacon for nailing it), and another scene where Pete makes the decision to use his stormchaser truck to block the storm drain in order to help save the people hiding in there (that was a cool truck by the way). My favorite scenes are when Gary returns to the high school to warn people to leave the school because it wouldn't stand against the massive twister that was approaching and everyone leaves on the buses and cars (he didn't have to go back to warn them, when he could've just gone to shelter with his sons but he chose to warn them), and the scene with people helping their elderly neighbor.

I definitely want to mention the casting, which was also well done.  Everyone fit their roles. I for one was glad that there weren't hysterical females (the characters of Allison and Kaitlyn were real troopers) and the characters all felt like people you know (yep, even the drunk idiots....who doesn't at least know one or two them?).  A lot of the actors I'm not familiar with; but I have heard of Sarah Wayne-Callies because of The Walking Dead show and I am familiar with Richard Armitage because of the Vicar of Dibley, The Hobbit trilogy, and a few British mysteries.  Hopefully this won't offend them but they blend in and don't overshadow the rest of the cast, you don't see them as Lori Grimes or Thorin Oakenshield - all of the actors were great as regular, ordinary people.

This is a movie worth seeing, especially if you liked Twister or any other disaster movies.  It's almost like a documentary with people using video cameras and seeing it from their POV and then as they abandon their cameras as they realize survival is more important, and the viewer goes along for the ride (except the drunk dudes...who of course love their cellphones, apparently a tornado won't part them from their cellphone, LOL!)  This was a film I'd be happy to see again!",1407628800,71,3324,4.680960548885078
6371685,5,B00J9C07GC,"I actually loved this movie. The way the movie was laid out, you get a glimpse of the movie as a ""documentary"". Normally I don't like when footage in movies is handheld ""actual"" footage, but it was done in such a way it did not leave me feeling sick or irritated. I really liked the characters, the acting was pretty good, and the effects are scary! The attention to detail was really uncanny. When my town experienced a tornado that destroyed our high school, resulting in the deaths of 8 people, I was shocked to see the destruction that was left behind. Things like bark impaling metal was a reality that is not normally seen in movies, even my beloved Twister. This movie brought that kind of detail to life, with one scene showing a tricycle impaled in a van door. To those who have not experienced the aftermath of an actual tornado, that would look fake, but I assure you, it was an accurate detail that a lot of tornado disaster movies leave out. The movie starts with a lot of action, and carries that through most of the movie. Intense is a word I would use, in fact. There are bits of humor, as well. There are a pair of drunken idiots who through the movie see how close they can get to a tornado. Were there bits that were unbelievable, sure. All movies have some degree of unbelievability to it to amp up the action, but overall I think this movie was well done. Finally, I want to mention one little scene where some characters are driving into town and a cow (presumably a plastic or metal one from a building) is thrown across the screen. I know there is no mention of it being a homage or connected to the class tornado movie ""Twister"", but that image immediately brought it to my mind. If you want some scary fun and love natural disaster movies, check this out! If you have been affected by a tornado in real life, you may not want to see this movie. There were scenes that I know people who were in the high school when the tornado hit in my town who won't want to see this as I fear it will bring them bad memories.",1407542400,6,2037,4.293506493506493
6371686,5,B00J9C07GC,absolutely loved it. very suspenseful and great graphics,1407542400,3,56,6.125
6371687,1,B00J9C07GC,"Experiencing an actual tornado may be more pleasant than experiencing Into the Storm, a godawful storm-chasing B movie which cannot hold a candle to Twister, a flawed film itself, but an entertaining one (now almost two decades old).  This picture is partly presented in the hand-held found-footage style, but it tends to abandon the conceit at the drop of the hat, shifting to flatly shot and poorly composed objective images.  It spends an inordinate amount of time establishing a set of characters who are at best uninteresting, at worst toxic.  Most of them have a predictable arc.  There is the brooding and guarded vice principal who has become estranged from and lost the respect of his teenage sons.  (Will the days of tornadoes renew their family?)  There is the meteorologist whose adrenaline-and-spectacle-minded employer, a storm chaser, prefers instinct to science.  (Will they find common ground, and will she prove her value to him?)  Then there are two hillbilly daredevils trying to create the ultimate viral video.  They come and go and are, I suspect, intended as comic relief.  (No predictable arc here.  They are just among the most grating and grotesque film characters in recent memory.)

After a deadly dull half hour watching these characters' morning routines, the tornadoes descend.  There are one or two instances of genuine spectacle, including a death by fiery cyclone and the destruction of an airport as the planes are lifted from the ground and thrown to and fro in the air, a moment shown in every trailer and television spot.  In general, however, nothing raised my pulse.  There is a notable dearth of showmanship and suspense, rendering scenes of extreme weather rote and inert.  This is a bit of an unpleasant surprise, too, considering the director made the disposable, but largely enjoyable Final Destination 5.  The ability to blend the macabre and the playful eludes him here.  To be blunt, there are no grounds on which to recommend Into the Storm.  It is a creative and technical dud.",1407456000,13,2028,5.017964071856287

6371692,5,B00J9C07GC,I actually enjoyed this movie. Not all the actors are famous but they are a great cast of actors who do know how to act and have great talent. This movie was eye catching with amazing special effects and lots of drama a real moving story. It's one of those movies that maybe could it could be a B movie have just been made for TV but it's actually worth watching and keeping you entertained. I give it an A because looks like it was real creative and for a disaster movie i think it's one of the greatest. Music by Brian Tyler is cinematic and epic with a moving orchestral sound and real good for movies like this.,1519171200,,615,4.176470588235294

6371698,1,B00J9C07GC,"The trailer looks promising...the movie itself, however, is so full of bad actors and REALLY unrealistic green screen work that I don't think I lasted 10 minutes, before turning it off.

And when I say unrealistic green screen work, Im not talking about the weather stuffIm talking about things like people in houses, people in vanswhere you see REALLY sharp delineation between them and the room they're in, or the road they're driving down.  Bad, like...oh, way back in the day, on Saturday morning kids shows, kind of bad.  Where the actors are all sharp and crisp and have one kind of post-processing and lighting on themand the background is entirely different.

In this day and age, where even cheap effects on your smartphone look quite goodthis was downright embarassing.  I kept looking at the release date in disbeliefbecause it seemed like something that wouldve been done for 70s tv.

And the acting?  Ugh.  Maybe there ARE some good actors in the show...but it didn't show in the first ten minutes.  :/

So whats with all the good reviews?

Beats me.  I mean, Im a fan of dance movies:  there are a TON of bad dance movies out there, but Ill suffer through the bad acting and hackneyed plot, because, Im basically watching it for the dancing...but I still KNOW they're bad movies!

I also love me some natural disaster movies...but I guess not as much as bad dance movies, because while Ill tolerate a trite plot, as long as the actors and special effects are good, I apparently won't tolerate lousy green screen work or bad acting.

I cant describe the storm special effects, because I didn't get that farbut they did look promising in the trailer, so if you're not picky about acting and green screen work and writing, as long as you get to see cool effectsmaybe youll enjoy this film.

If, on the other hand, you expect a polished package with your special effectsat the very least, some reasonably good actingmove long:  these are not the droids you're looking for!",1515110400,,1982,4.715116279069767

I might have felt cheated if I'd payed more to watch this, but I only paid 99 cents w/ a Cyber Monday discount.

The mix of ages with the main characters intrigued me.  I connected with even the younger high school kids and their relationships with friends and their dad.  The special effects are really what draw me to see a disaster movie and this one  made me feel like I was there. Of course some of that is because I was watching it on a 100"" screen with a 7.2 surround sound system so I saw, heard and felt the booms and bangs as lightning flashed and crackled and things being tossed about hit the ground.

6371770,3,B00J9C07GC,"I love movies and I like watching storm chases. The problem is the writing feels bland and the characters are hard to relate. Almost cookie cutter. The footage is way too consistent and smooth (what Iphone or cheap security cam captures in IMAX-like quality?) to give that found footage feel. The storm chasing aspect feels completely wrong, only getting an internal shot for fame (but then again you got IMAX film director Sean Casey who wanted to do just that) and the family aspect feels more like walking cardboard cutouts.

The only thing I can praise is the special effects. It's rare to get a twister on screen to look that good. I went through a handful of cinema and made-for-TV movies with tornadoes and the only ones that were close to real were Twister, Oz The Great and Powerful, and The Day After Tomorrow. I love the detail put in to make the damage real. It did throw me off to see an airport destruction scene (what's it doing there anyway?) but still, I gotta give props to the CGI team.

It's a decent watch just for entertainment purposes alone. Just don't expect story depth besides a single parent family, fame hungry chasers, and a bunch of drunk rednecks that appear for no apparent reason. And the occasional airborne cow.",1476489600,,1247,4.638009049773756

This movie just fell short for me.... some of the acting was great and good but some of it was just awful. The dude that played the storm chaser driving the Titus.... he was just over acting for me. Was not convincing at all in that roll.

The overall storyline was lacking...the only thing that kept me watching...the special effects were pretty good.

I could have done without the 2 redneck guys they had here and there throughout the movie.

If you have nothing else....and I mean nothing else to watch....then this would be okay. I'm glad I rented it when it was $0.99 instead of whatever it normally rents for.

Into the storm lacks the depth and personality of ""Twister"" (1996) (also from Warner Bros.). It's heavy on the CGI, which should and never is a replacement for character development and substance. Sure it has some decent effects, but that's what CGI is, but there wasn't any reason to care. The acting was flat and predictable.. I felt like I was watching something disposable on the CW...

I also could have done without the ""funny"" part as it really didn't fit into the mood of the movie one bit and was more annoying than actually funny. BUT with that being said, the plot is exciting and it will have you at the edge of your seat the whole way through. It brings any tornado nightmare you've had to life. Imagine escaping a tornado, thinking you're in the clear, only to be faced with yet another tornado. I won't say more because I obviously don't want to ruin anything. But if you can get passed a few cheesey parts, and you can appreciate the fear the writer is trying to instill into the audience, you will like this movie.",1463875200,,716,4.390977443609023

6371864,3,B00J9C07GC,"You know what's interesting is how far we've come concerning our movie viewing expectations.  At one time, like in the mid 90's when Twister came out starring Helen Hunt, special effects in movies were considered groundbreaking back then so a movie like Twister looked really advanced and everyone loved it.  But now, in 2014?  We've grown accustomed to tornado films apparently judging by the many negative reviews you'll find for Into the Storm, so a movie that tries to execute the same outrageous special effects in 2014 doesn't seem so adventurous and exciting nowadays.

With that said, I'm always ready for a good tornado movie regardless how overused and predictable the storytelling has become.  These characters are all generic storm chasers- you know the type.  Constantly driving through small towns, down highways and fields in search of the greatest tornado ever recorded, frantically tracking storms on their computers inside their van... even one of the storm chasers is a typical idiot who cares more about his precious film footage than he does common sense and assuring his crew are safe and sound which means he's willing to take chances that others won't.  Yeah the movie even has one of *those* guys!  And he IS a jerk too.

The writing is so clichd that it could honestly be compared to an adult film in that regard.  After all nobody pays attention to the story in those films... much like nobody should pay attention to the story in a movie like this because you know all how it's going to unfold, and you know how the characters are going to act- they're going to be forgettable and you'll quickly notice they could've been replaced with anyone who's even a halfway decent actor/actress.

In this case you have a typical dad who's never around to take care of his son so the two often feud (so predictable for a storm chaser movie!).  You have a teen nervously approaching a girl he likes and eventually the two become trapped together (predictable alert once again!).  The above mentioned selfish/self-centered storm chaser guy who cares more about the footage than human life.  Let's not forget the last second critical decisions (""You can't stay here!  Come with me!"" *5 seconds later tornado destroys said area*.  Whew, that was a close one!"")  In this case a school filled with children (granted the way the tornado destroys the school was really impressive).  I don't know about anyone else, but when I was a teen I HATED school and sort of looked forward to the idea of a tornado ripping it apart.  Mean maybe, but true.  So I had to laugh a little when the one lady says ""The tornado's headed right for the school!""  Obviously real tornadoes destroying a school is no laughing matter.  But in a movie?  Yes!

Just for added fun the movie throws in some party animals that are so drunk they don't even care if the tornado comes by, picks them up and tosses 'em around.  And of course the party teens who like to jump over burning swimming pools riding their four wheelers adds to more forgettable writing.  Sometimes the locations jump around in an awkward way too.  For example while the storm chasers are staying at a hotel, golf ball-sized hail rains down... then the story shows a high school graduation taking place outside where it's perfectly calm.  I was expecting huge balls of hail to rain down on the students but no.

Now the special effects are fun.  That's the only reason one would watch a movie like this.  I have to be a little picky though.  It's annoying when a tornado is literally destroying a building 100 feet from where the people are standing and *none* of the debris shoots down and hits anybody.  That's really unbelievable.  Also the fact they'd stick around and watch the tornado cause all this destruction without even flinching.  I don't care how professional they are as storm chasers- when a tornado *that* close is causing total destruction, you're going to be running/driving away and hiding as fast as you can.  Also a strange moment in the beginning when the skies are perfectly clear with no detection of tornado activity... and just when the storm chasers are about to give up the weather completely changes and now there's tornados forming everywhere.  Not all the special effects work either.  The ones that show tornadoes forming and gradually lowering to the ground aren't very believable looking and look low budget.

With that said, the most outrageous moment comes at the very end.  The biggest tornado EVER recorded with 300 mph winds lands (just look at the sheer size of that bad boy!) which forces everyone into a ""safe"" area... yeah the area isn't really that safe hence the quotation marks.  You know *some* suspense has to happen after all, because everyone tucked away nice and cutely would be too pleasant for a destructive tornado.  Of course the tornado has to almost follow the people for the purpose of more suspense.  Only in Hollywood.

Oh and the documentary parts?  They're used so subtly that Into the Storm basically plays like a regular tornado adventure movie.  Into the Storm is average because we've seen the same thing a bunch of times and the thrill wears off after a while, but for an hour and a half of entertainment it's not bad.  This movie doesn't really do anything that hasn't already been done before and better.",1452211200,,5324,4.768306010928962

6371869,3,B00J9C07GC,"Oh dear, dear where should I start? Most through the movie I was so freaking annoyed. Why because if you are gonna do some major tornado disaster movie setting in the Midwest especially Oklahoma where thats where tornadoes are....why do you have a high school have their graduation outside let alone that day when you know its coming?!?!?!.....Not only is that so unrealistic because it would be a liability risk but also just plain damn stupid. Whoever freaking wrote the script or whatever sure NOT from the Midwest and than have a girl ask, ""whats that noise?"" when the tornado is coming like you hear that s*** miles away and there has been warnings all day about a storm and you ask that? Ummmm.....stupid. IF you were gonna have this disaster movie in a different state where tornadoes are uncommon and to have the graduation part and the girl ask that question than I can see the story being better....and than theres two drunken idiot, jackass wannabes.....
The graphics are very very good and after awhile you get less annoyed and more into the scene and your heart is racing and start to be like yes this movie is so good.....until the last minute where the drunken idiots are alive in the trees while Pete is dead who was in that tank of a vehicle....how the freak does that work??? again stupid....if they were trying to get some comedic relief with those guys they freaking failed miserably. nothing funny about that.
In all seriousness if you take out the drunken idiots and the unrealistic plot of people in OK seeming to not know a thing about tornadoes and to be stupid and have their graduation and to have it outside on top of it, than its a pretty damn good movie... or if it was set in a different state i think it would have been a lot more better because I know I'm not the only one that will probably be annoyed with it.....
If you can get past the story and be amazed by the graphics and the atmosphere that brings and get into the movie that way, its so much more better and than worth it....thats why its in the middle for me!",1449964800,,2053,4.462765957446808

6371903,4,B00J9C07GC,"I first noticed Richard Armitage in The Hobbit, and I have been steadily working my way through the rest of his filmography, very interested in the diverse roles he's taken and, of course, his rich acting abilities.  I hesitated over this film because it didn't strike me as being much more than a mid-range, quickie-profit film of the style Hollywood so often churns out.

I was really pleasantly surprised.  The film itself didn't descend into cliche, and happily you don't see an ending where the handsome lead (Armitage) inevitably ends up with the other beautiful lead (Callies).  The storms manage to stay front and center, and their impact is well-done - although, having grown up in Tornado Alley, there are certainly plot-holes.  No town in the Midwest is going to make a school a town storm shelter, for example.

I bought this film at the local PX, and although I don't think it quite worth the $20 price, I'll watch it again in the future, probably several times.  It's certainly worth the rental price, and I found it very enjoyable to watch Armitage in a role that's not one of his usual, even if it wasn't a challenge for him.  The film gets your heart rate up but doesn't go overlong or descend into formula.  It's really quite enjoyable, in the end.",1443744000,,1266,4.666666666666667

6371965,4,B00J9C07GC,Good movie.,1436140800,,11,5.0
6371966,1,B00J9C07GC,This movie is an insult to anyone with common sense... Since when does a tornado silently sneak up on you when it's on the ground? Since when can you walk right up to a tornado and video tape it? There are some many things wrong with this movie... Twister did a much better job getting things right with a good story as well... Into The Storm is a complete disaster. no pun intended....,1436054400,,386,4.301369863013699
6371967,3,B00J9C07GC,"Back in 1996, I thought Twister was kind of amazing. A movie about tornadoes that wrecked everything in their path. And the tornadoes looked GOOD. And Helen Hunt looked GOOD. And Bill Paxton was BILL PAXTON. And the score was HANS ZIMMER (or Mark Mancina or Harry Gregson-Williams or whoever the hell wrote it).

Well, it's 2015 and CGI tornadoes aren't enough to impress anyone anymore since CGI just isn't that impressive anymore, and Helen Hunt no longer looks good. Bruce Campbell had his own tornado movie in 1996 called ""Tornado!"" This is a movie about tornadoes made in 2014. They wreck a school and destroy houses and even turn into fire, sucking up some poor sap trying to salvage some quality tornado footage, who subsequently burns alive in 200+ mph winds. But what do I care about him? I just want to see some wanton natural destruction. And this movie makes it so I don't care about most of these dumb characters.

On that front, the movie delivers. This is an excellent mindless action movie. But for an actual film where you dare expect some semblance of quality, it's just okay. Kids nearly drown, other teens are sucked into the vortex of a violent funnel while ""hiding"" in the school hallways and idiots with cameras get their just due (or do they?), but this still boils down to pure average. I don't care about any of these people, even the dude in the tank-truck who's more than willing to sacrifice himself to get that wind data for science. PURE SCIENCE. He's all about the thrill anyway lol. He's no Bill Paxton.

Come to think of it, none of these characters are Bill Paxton. They're not even Bruce Campbell. They're just glorified noise until the tornadoes show up. They should have all died. Three stars because we rarely see this type of movie anymore and I respect the brass of the filmmakers for making a natural disaster flick in 2014.",1435795200,,1866,4.648484848484848

6371974,4,B00J9C07GC,"I love adventure movies of that kind - things out of human's control...and how humans deal with them. I really liked 2012, for example.
This movie I watched while being on a plane (had not heard of it before). I must admit I watched it because I like Richard Armitage, so I gave it a try.

All in all I think it is a pretty good movie. The effects made everything look very real.
The story was ok, not cheesy really (except maybe for the scene where both teenagers were almost about to drown).

The only scene I did not like was the last one...it was supposed to be funny to see the two crazy-stupid storm hunters hanging in a tree - and STILL alive...however, one of the main characters had died and that was tragic...first of all, the two crazies could NOT have survived after the storm had swallowed them - no way. And second of all, if there is a lesson...what is it...that you can be an idiot and will still survive and never pay for being stupid on purpose? Yeah, besides that...it was a good movie and I would watch it again.",1435276800,,1032,4.287179487179487

6371977,2,B00J9C07GC,"Grimacing, cringing, shaking my head throughout the movie.  Unfortunately, it wasn't because of the tornados tearing up the fictional midwestern town.  In short, the screenplay left a swath of unreality through forced, awkward dialogue.  What comes to mind is a puppet theater where the placement is all out of whack, and the conversations go in slow motion, making it tremendously difficult to get past the puppetry.

A few of the actors did as much as they could with the *faux* parts they were handed.  But, much of the acting was atrocious.  Let's just say, it's a twist to go from playing a smarta$$ doctor in The Hangover to being a driver here of one of the worst props in movie history:  Titus (a tank dressed up as a tornado-vortex hunter).  Unfortunately, Dr. Hangover was unable to switch off here the same smirk and tone that played well in the blockbuster comedy.

The special effects were spectacular, and created tension even in the face of the screenwriters' demolition of any sense of credibility or suspension of disbelief.",1435104000,,1041,4.869318181818182

6372058,5,B00J9C07GC,"Into The Storm wasn't one of the most hyped disaster movies ever to be released, and I don't think it was one of the biggest budgeted either, but it does turn out to be one of the best.  A team of professional storm chasers with a custom built, supposedly 'stormproof' armored van (almost tanklike in appearance) has been following weather patterns around hoping to come on an emerging tornado in an attempt to get inside the actual eye and film it.  Their search brings them to the typical small town of Silverton, on the day of high school graduation, but the series of immense tornados that emerge are beyond anything they planned for.  The seige of storms turns the day into a fight for survival for both the storm chasers and the townspeople.  The threat of the storms is authentic feeling and effective because they ramp it up without overdoing it.  It's never depicted as ""oh, this is the storm that's going to end human civilization"", but as a more believable event, if on the upper end of the scale of such things.  And in doing so it's presented as a huge danger to anyone and everyone in the area, without losing credibility.  There's also a passing nod to the idea that while this event isn't completely unprecedented, it is part of a larger pattern - as one character says, what used to be a once-in-a-lifetime storm is getting to be something like once a year.

The movie took the time to let us get to know a number of diverse characters, and has a couple of believable subplots in play before the tornadoes actually hit.  Once they do start touching down, they're very visually effective thanks to great work on the special effects front.  Actually, I think I heard somewhere that the budget (while probably not puny) was on the lower end of budgets for this kind of movie, but you certainly wouldn't be able to tell that from the movie itself.  It looks fantastic.  Well made, well acted, with good interplay between the characters and some pretty dramatic action, this is among the best possible picks if you're looking for a good disaster movie.",1428364800,,2064,4.609289617486339

This has more of a tv movie feel to it, but the characters seem real and the special effects are very good. As far as disaster movies, it doesn't touch The Impossible, or War of the Worlds, but for a low-budget movie on a cold springtime Saturday, grab a blanket and some popcorn, and give it a go.",1428105600,,408,4.527027027027027
6372066,3,B00J9C07GC,Ok movie the effects and filming of the storm were excellent it was just the rest of the movie that really was below par!!,1428105600,,122,4.125
6372067,3,B00J9C07GC,"Let me first say that I love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twister/dp/B003Y5USG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twister</a>, the 1996 film that so obviously inspired the 2014 work ""Into the Storm."" I've owned that movie on VHS for many years and can recite lines from multiple scenes. ""Into the Storm"" is not on the same level of dramatic structure and certainly lacks the intimidating Hollywood budget. Still, this film's portrayal of the deadly nature of tornadoes is far more accurate. It's not fun and games to play with tornadoes to the ear-splitting riffs of Rainbow (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Best-of-Rainbow/dp/B000001EZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Best of Rainbow</a>).

Tornadoes are unimaginably deadly and in fact killed some storm chasers a year ago. This does not mean storm chasers are heroes on the level of New York firefighters, as they are much closer to the comedic pair of ""Jackass"" wannabes of this film. Anyway, having followed a central Texas F5 and seen its chilling destruction where most of the victims' bodies were never found (to include an entire family), it was perhaps one of the greatest rude awakenings of my life. It's akin to soldiers seeing combat for the first time. The reality washes away the romance almost immediately. I liked that aspect of ""Into the Storm.""

There's one unforgettable moment, plausible or not, in which a character is sucked into the sky far above the clouds and soon hurtles back to earth in the most nightmarish rollercoaster one can imagine. I actually re-watched that scene. Director Steven Quale has done a respectable job with this exploitation, but the actors including the talented Richard Armitage (sans beard) and the lovely Sarah Wayne Callies, disappear in a fog of CGI extravaganza. I also dislike hand-held/lost footage films. ""Into the Storm"" mixes that cheap device with traditional footage to include a musical score during dramatic moments. I'm of the belief you can't go both ways.

I've argued the ""global warming"" point with many, essentially stating that weather disasters are more prevalent than ever before because of its effects. Their counterpoint, also valid, is that storms are covered so obsessively in today's social media-video-driven society it creates the perception they are more prevalent. ""Into the Storm"" touches upon this subject, though not enough. The key to a truly great film could have been found there. Maybe.",1428105600,,2509,5.632275132275132

6372101,3,B00J9C07GC,"If you have seen ""Twister,"" then you've already seen this one.  It's really the same movie.

Some storm chasers are out chasing tornadoes and trying to get inside one so they can video tape it and get info about these storms.  They mention other storms that happened recently like Katrina, Sandy, and the Joplin storms in an attempt to show us that this movie is a current film, but it also dates the movie as well.

Then we have two characters named ""Donk,"" and Reevis who are redneck thrill seekers who look like they'd be more at home on an episode of MTV's Jackass than they do in this movie.  And to be perfectly honestly, they are the best part of this entire movie.  They make me laugh and I wanna know what happens to them.  Why couldn't the whole movie have been about them?  Now that would have been a cool movie!

Also I have to wonder about this ""Titus"" vehicle.  With all that armor and extra features, it'd probably have some of the worst gas mileage in the history of motor vehicles.

All in all, it's a movie you've probably already seen.  It's got lots of destruction in it, it's got lots of special effects like cars flying through the air, buildings being destroyed and a tornado catching on fire for no other reason than it looks really cool.  The actors are just okay, the only one who gave a really bad performance was Sarah Wayne Callies.  I hated her in The Walking Dead (Mainly because her character was just so damn annoying), and she was just bad in this one as well.  It's really just mindless destruction and special effects for 90 minutes, and it's honestly not terrible to watch.

Several issues come to mind: it's poorly written; the acting is terrible; and how is it that people who supposedly live in the Midwest could be surprised by a tornado?? Aren't they fairly common back there? Additionally, if you miss hating Lori Grimes from The Walking Dead, you can continue to detest her in this awful flick.

The downside, the story was lame, plot holes big enough to drive a truck into, the ""behind the camera"" mode during certain portions of the plot were silly and lets not forget about the low brow attempt of humor with the escapades of the twin redneck, YouTube posting newbie storm chasers,  the end segments simply provided a way for this movie to lose any remaining credibility.",1425081600,,744,4.707692307692308

The characters for the most part did everything within the realm of poor thinking. Many times in the film they did the worst things that they could have done in a tornado.

The presence of multi-funnel tornados and finally an F5 tornado had good special effects and this is about all that made the film worth watching. Even then there was a fire twister that stood in the same spot for 5 minutes, come on man. Tornados move and many move very quickly.

This film had a medium grade script, medium grade actors and a weak story line. I rated it as 3 stars for mildly entertaining but not a movie that you would want to buy the DVD.",1424476800,,793,4.351351351351352

Into the Storm is another of those dreadful `found-footage hand-held camera' flicks.  It literally depicts idiots filming idiots filming a few FX shots.  These dopey camera operators are unevenly divided between three groups of people filming themselves for vanity sake.  There's a bunch of yahoos doing stunts for the Internet.  There are a couple of dopey kids shooting footage for graduation.  And there's a film crew/storm chasers trying to get footage for fame and fortune.  There is nothing particularly fascinating about any of these people and their dopey endeavors.  They are stock characters shooting stock footage for their own amusement.  There is nothing more obnoxious than people filming themselves while uttering banal sentiments.  None of these people should ever have access to cameras.

Yes, the special effects are outstanding.  But you can't have just that and nothing else.  The story is limited in scope.  It concerns people chasing storms and people getting out of the way of these storms.  These people had no depth; they were just props to be maneuvered about as the inadequate plot dictated.  I was only impressed by one FX shot of planes being lifted in the storm.  Otherwise, eh.  Not something I'd ever care to watch again.",1423180800,,1423,5.004273504273504

The acting was somewhat mediocre with what seemed at times like it was casted with amateur actors, some even seeming as though they were reading from cue cards. As for the graphic nature of the movie itself, it was ""okay."" Some of the scenes were a bit campy with incoming tornadoes but others were pretty good. I guess I may have been over anticipating the storms to seem more real to life. I believe that a better look at movies such as Twister should have been a sort of baseline for ideas and then improve upon it. Other than the story line of the tornado outbreak, the sub-stories of the boy wants girl and the father-son relationship were just sort of typical and nothing new.
Overall, I guess the movie was just ""okay."" I wish I would have waited for Netflix to offer it for free streaming but oh well.",1422748800,,921,4.2988505747126435

The actors in this movie were terrible and it could have totally went straight to DVD. However I did like the special effects at the end of the movie when they were inside the eye of the storm that was really good but other than that I'll give this movie a two because of that.

6372313,4,B00J9C07GC,"Many people say that Into The Storm was too much like Twister, but that is only partially correct. Twister was the story of storm chasers, trying to beat another team to the punch in getting data from inside a tornado. Into The Storm also has storm chasers, but they're only a part of the story, as it also features the town caught in a super storm, and a family caught in the middle. If you want to compare this film to twister, simply because of tornadoes and storm chasers you can, but Into The Storm still wins, as it features a better background story, better special effects, and is overall much more intense. Richard Armitage stars as the High School's assistant principle, that goes into the storm to find his missing son, and save other people in the path. While the British Actor isn't known for anything more than The Hobbit, he showed real intensity and fortitude, making the film so much more exciting. He's paired with storm chaser turned rescuer, Sarah Wayne Callies, best known for her roles in Prison Break and The Walking Dead. Callies usual plays the strong female character with great ideas, the leaders right hand if you will. In this film however she is little more than a follower, leading to a performance that wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. When you have a film with the popularity of Twister, anything else that features anything even remotely similar is going to be compared to that film and ultimately called a rip off, and parts of it could be considered that. When watching the film and now reflecting on it, I prefer to think of it as updating a great idea with a new cast, story, and effects. You are free to disagree and if you're one of those people who think of it as just another rip off, I'd still recommend seeing it for the special effects, if nothing else.",1420934400,,1813,4.513677811550152

6372316,2,B00J9C07GC,"While the special effects and twisters were fun to watch, ultimately I found this flick to be a lesson in narcissism. The intent of all characters is to get the storm footage at any cost - from the high school kids, and  drunk rednecks, to the storm chasers themselves. Personally, if I was about to drown, l'd be looking for a way out, not filming my goodbyes. Even to the end - their town is demolished, but they have to finish their commentary.

But it needed a better storyline because I honestly didn't really care about what happened to the characters, they had so little personality. Needed a better writer, I loved ""Twister"" and hold all other such movies to their high quality when it comes to it. As a matter of fact, I sat down and watched ""Twister"" again right after viewing ""Into the Storm"" since it made me nostalgic for a good storyline for this genre.

While the CGI was passable, the story line in which it was used stretched reality to the point where it became humorous to see what catastrophic events could be contrived next.

6372474,2,B00J9C07GC,Decent acting but not great. Tornados looked fake. I figured 18 years after Twister came out they would look more realistic. They seemed to have taken a step backwards with this movies budget. Also how many tornadoes hit the one town in this movie??? Like 20? So unrealistic. Lastly tornadoes do not spawn and become so violent within 2 seconds like they do in this movie. I'm no meteorologist but I think most Americans especially those in the heart of the country know this.

6372493,1,B00J9C07GC,"Being a third-rate knockoff of Discovery's Storm Chasers TV series (cancelled in 2012), this flick should have been converted into a documentary about the wonders of CGI circa 2014. Maybe then (and that's a strong ""maybe"") it might have garnered some positive comments from this reviewer.

I can't quote the line exactly now, but the shot where the brilliant young meteorologist Allison Stone, played by actress Sarah Wayne Callies, considers Katrina and Joplin THE harbingers of a man-made climate changed whacked future---a time when tornadoes will devastate places like Los Angeles (I was anxiously awaiting her prediction that a new category of storm named ""EF6"" will emerge) was the high point of the film.

Take notes now. If you make it to the credits then you will have witnessed every trick in the book used by B movie makers to keep the soft drinks and candy flowing. Consequently, my advice is to throw a bag of popcorn in the microwave and watch a WW1 documentary on youtube instead. At least then you will have learned something about an actual historical event (no CGI necessary).

To summarize: This movie blows! Literally.",1419552000,,1138,4.978947368421053

6372584,3,B00J9C07GC,"I wanted to like this. I liked the 90s movie, Twister. I am from the midwest and have a lot of moments of crouching down underneath the stairs when the tornado alarms go off. Unfortunately, this movie has little resemblance to the original storm chaser movie, Twister, nor a real life tornado. It's got horrible writing, bad acting, and a really poor storyline holding it all together.

So, why 3 stars instead of 1? Two reasons: special effects and Richard Armitage. The special effects are incredible. I have no idea how all the flying cars, houses being torn apart, and wind funnels was done, but it looks convincingly real to me. Very impressive. There are a couple of scenes that are worth the other 90 minutes of dead air. I think you'll like those.

I was really intrigued to see RArmitage do an American accent. He pulls it off. Not only that, but it's a MIDWEST accent. Well done. He doesn't have a lot to do so don't expect a too much, but then again, neither does anyone else. It's light on relationship, dialog, and plot. The special effects are the star of the show.

6372589,3,B00J9C07GC,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Into the Storm""  (USA, 2014)

1. This movie has some pretty spectacular storm effects. It's probably the best disaster porn I've ever seen.

2. The rest of the movie is one of the worst films of 2014.
  And if you combine these two things together, you get absolute magic.

3. For some reason, they decided to make this a ""found footage"" film. All the characters run around filming everything. It's kind of like ""Paranormal Activity"", but they see tornadoes instead of ghosts.

4. There are three separate mini-plots in the film, and the movie jumps from camera to camera, plot to plot. And sometimes it turns into a regular movie. But you can't tell really when that is, because all the cameras in the town are the same quality, whether they are high-end professional equipment, or cell phones.

5. I love the scene when the dad is standing in torrential winds and rain, looking in horror at something, but his hair and clothes are perfectly dry and still, like there was one spot of clear weather right above his head.

6. I also love the emotional, melodramatic scene where two teenagers are about to die so they film a goodbye to their parents. The girl tells her parents that she's dying next to a sweet boy that she hardly knows, ""so it's kind of OK"". And the boy tells his brother to stay awesome. And then the boy and girl hug each other, and I noticed that neither one of them is holding a camera.

7. But my favorite scene is about the amateur storm chaser. He's terrified of bad weather, and keeps wanting to go home. But when he sees a tornado made of fire, he grabs the camera and basically runs right into it.

8. Oh man, I can't even talk about the white-trash rednecks.

9. The script is clumsy, the dialogue is awkward and sometimes nonsensical. The ""suspense"" is built on laughable situations. And the only real purpose of the movie is to watch the destruction of a town that's so small it has one high school, but also has a big airport.
So what I'm saying is, this is a pretty great bad movie. I'm gonna be buying this one.",1418860800,5,2072,4.437994722955145

6372717,2,B00J9C07GC,"A two-star rating is warranted, only for the special effects being the most top-notch and fantastical in any cinematic depiction of a tornado to-date.

In 2014's biggest cliche'd installment (from the title to the characters you care nothing for), this is only a showcase of ""look-at-what-we-can-do-now-with-CGI."" All else is hustled, thin, uninteresting and distractingly annoying.  But that's what is supposed to be, right? Given the fact the tornadoes are the centerpieces.  Even then, much science has to be suspended to have the plot (expected).  Any storm-chasing aficionado will see the parallels between the Discovery series, et al.  (It should also pay respects to Cloverfield for having stolen some elements from it).  It is refreshing in that some scenes provide some laughability, though probably in spots it wasn't intended.

If you're a weather buff, it's the kind of film that you know you can't turn away from, and will feel guilty for not having watched, but having watched it 3/4 of the way through, (if  you last that long), you lament the loss of the rental fee.

Pros. : Good special effects.
Cons. : The movie starts with a good premise, people who are professional storm chasers.
However the story becomes a convoluted mess of so many typical movies today of teenager in love and not understood by parents.
Toss in local hicks with marginal acting skills who also chase storms then completely ruin movie with P.O.V., point of view camera work thru the actors eyes combine it with shaky footage and you have a train wreck of a movie.
Usually I'm more understanding and forgiving of action/disaster movies because of their limited budget but that was not the case here.
You had a large budget production with veteran actors so the fault lies with the director, story writer and producer.
Bottom line ... save your money and watch the movie when it's shown on cable TV if your inclined to see it.",1417824000,,953,4.678571428571429

It's worth watching if you enjoy making fun of bad disaster movies (I do, so I did). Spoiler alert! Oh, wait I said predictable, right? A storm chaser actually walks right up to a twister to film it and gets sucked in -- ever hear of a zoom lense? It's not a pigmy mouse, it's a 200 ft high tornado -- take a few steps back, dude!

I love disaster movies and appreciate ""movie disasters"". I saw the previews and had high hopes this was gonna be one of the former. I should have had kept my expectations low, then I would've been pleasantly surprised. I just want to know what I'm in store for so I can mentally prepare, load my satirical-criticism gun and microwave the cheap, flavorless popcorn for full-frontal screen assaults. I'd offer another spoiler for the review but the film takes care of that itself -- unless this is your first tornado disaster movie, in which case I'll change my review to say its original, thrilling, non-stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat. So, two thumbs up & enjoy!

I'm sure the graphics were amazing, but I could hardly make them out, even in HD format, due to Amazon's lousy, dark, pixel-riddled download. I use and love Amazon's Instant Video, and I've been a loyal, long-term Prime Member (you're welcome, Amazon), but this is my first (and last) purchase. Save your hard-earned money & Redbox this one. You probably won't watch it twice anyway unless you're trapped with your boring relatives and parasitic neighbors in a storm shelter waiting for a tornado to pass you by while secretly hoping it will suck the DVD player out the shelter door along with your weird uncle who eats cheese balls out of his navel.",1417824000,2,1823,4.571865443425076

6372765,3,B00J9C07GC,"The story is told from a couple of angles that end up merging together as a massive storm cell produces multiple tornados in a ten mile area. We follow a group of storm chasers working on a documentary that hasn't seen any tornado activity in a year and needs to do so fast. We also follow a father and his two teenage sons. We get to know some of the other characters mostly through video everyone is taking of either footage for a video time capsule, or the antics of two drunk men who will do anything outrageous to post on youtube.

The special effects are definitely good and we do get relationship building between the father and sons. Plenty of drama. Other than that, the tornados are the big focus and you get more here than with the movie, Twister. The story itself leaves something to be desired and there are a number of places that youll need to suspend logic. A few entertaining scenes and a couple of them will make you feel good.

By the end of the movie, we were rooting for the tornadoes.  Skip this movie and watch an episode of ""Tornado Chasers"" instead.",1417478400,2,420,4.56

The climax, obviously paying homage to the dedicated storm chasers who died in the 2013 El Reno, OK, tornado, was insulting.

Very tough on movies in general and tend to lean toward the action type movies. This movie had everything you could want in a disaster movie and then some.

I'll keep it simple. Whoever wrote this screenplay was mainly interested in action/special effects. His understanding of people in disasters is extremely immature, shallow, insensitive and just plain not realistic. He obviously knows nothing about the the real people who live in these dangerous areas. I have lived in Kansas so I do have some experience. I would say that many people have a belief in God and have faith when disaster and its aftermath occurs. But once again, as with our modern secular era. references to religion and spirituality have been almost completely left out (except one scene in a church where nobody says the three letter word ""God"" or any type of prayer.

First clue was the signature line of dialogue that you'll hear in every SyFy disaster movie, ""whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, you mean to tell me _____"". Then there's the bad acting, the female lead who makes sanctimonious bad decisions based on her misplaced compassion and the take charge character who has no inkling of what to do in the emergency they're saving everybody from... ""the tornado is going to hit this designated shelter in a minute, everyone get to the busses"". Of course in the context of the writer's mind, that works to a degree but c'mon man.

Semi-decent graphics on a couple of the twisters were the only saving grace of this horrible flick. The acting, for the most part, was cheesy. I developed no interest in any of the characters, despite their attempts at pulling at my heartstrings. The real killer here is the incredulous situations. Despite being in an F5 with winds of over 300 mps, the leading lady is able to stand up straight in the storm drain with barely a hair out of place, and the next moment 2 guys are being slammed against the storm grate with full-force! And on and on. This movie is nothing like the real 4.5 star tornado movie Twister because of scenes like that.

6373056,2,B00J9C07GC,"The main detractors for the movies, in my opinion, are poor acting and a silly premise that, unfortunately will be believed by many viewers.  While the producers try to stay away from playing the human-blame game for the storms, they could not resist making a declaration that an unrealistic quantity of super cells that produce tornadoes in the same general area over a one-day period of time were to be expected.  Why? Because of Katrina, which many people think was caused by the actions of human beings. Also, the scientist who holds a PhD and has dedicated her life to chasing tornadoes, suddenly gets cold feet when she meets a tornado and wishes she was home with her little girl. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. The effects were good, however.",1416787200,,764,4.610294117647059

6373058,3,B00J9C07GC,"Into the Storm is a disaster film that often plays like nightly news coverage. Weve all seen extreme weather over the past two years, so the movie plays almost like a docudrama or cautionary tale. It takes place in the small town of Silverton, where the school year is winding down. In typical disaster movie fashion, we are introduced to a small group of folks who will soon find themselves trying to survive a series of tornadoes that descend on the town. Thats right, not one tornado, but several. The special effects team have a field day as the cyclones wreak havoc on people, buildings, vehicles, and the overall landscape.

Theres little character development. The film is a dazzle dazzle collection of computer-generated mayhem.

The Blu-ray/DVD edition contains a digital HD copy, featurettes on the scientific conditions behind destructive windstorms, the design of a high-tech storm-chasing tank built from an ordinary car, and the on-set recreation of brutal winds.",1416787200,,977,5.138364779874214

6373060,5,B00J9C07GC,It is what it promises. Some might not be into disaster movies and I think that's where you get some bad reviews. It's not a cheap sci-fi channel production and none of the actors ham it up either.  There's emotions but nothing overly sappy.  I'd compare it to Twister & Cloverfield. Into The Storm does a nice job of character development before the tornadoes occur.  It's refreshing to see CGI used for something other than robots.  Planes being sucked into the air... come on.  Plenty of scares and tension thrown in to keep you on edge too. Nothing draggy or unneeded.,1416787200,,572,4.623762376237623

around crappy storm chasers and smart mouth kids.  Much of the film was from the kids video cameras, with the pictures bouncing
around like a LA earthquake.  But the visuals were state of the art with lots and lots of tornados of various types.  The finale tornado
however looks kind of phony.  Still most of the scenes were quite well done and creepy.  Its ok to watch as long as you don't take
the actors seriously.  The wobbly camera shots were reminiscent of CLOVERFIELD but that movie had a better story line.  I give this
""masterpiece"" three stars for the fine special effects; a good story would have gotten it 4 or 5 stars because I am fascinated by
tornados growing up in the Mid West.  I never saw one though my family members did.  So enjoy the effects and heck with the rest.

6373129,3,B00J9C07GC,"Into The Storm is basically a thrill ride of special effects. Once the action starts, you get to see some awesome tornados (Into The Night has the firenado). Although the storyline is mediocre at best, it really doesn't matter. There's not a lot of lines being delivered through a constant barrage of tornadoes other than, ""HOLD ON!"" It's mostly characters yelling at each other over the storm sounds. The storyline is basically background noise. I cannot remember any of the characters' names and the only other thing I remember is the local high school was making a time capsule. No interesting story at all. However, It's a decent 3 star movie for the non-stop tornado ride (maybe it's a guy thing).

Some reviewers stated the movie is like a documentary or POV/hand held filmed type of movie, it's not. It's a regular movie. It's also not what I would consider low budget nor a ""B"" type movie. One of the kids is constantly trying to video the tornadoes but we never see the action from his video viewpoint. Another reviewer mentioned poor character development. There is a background story, but after the tornadoes start, how much dialogue, character building and conflict resolution can you have? The makers try to keep the story going throughout the movie but it's not anything really interesting. It's not easy to have a meaningful conversation while running from one tornado after another. It's a visual action/thriller with a minor background story.

If you have never seen Twister, rent it. Totally worthy of 5 stars. Helen Hunt is great. Twister has much better writing, actors, acting and a storyline ... and some great twisters (Twister has the cownado). Into The Storm has a lot more special effects but Twister is visually rich with higher quality effects and filming.",1416441600,9,1784,4.903973509933775

This is definitely a step up from the classic Twister movie in terms of how crazy and out of control these tornadoes get (with the help of modern day advances in CGI and green screen). Three words: FIRE FREAKING TORNADO!!! While I did get the sense of an environmental agenda (global warming, storm of the century, references to actual devastating tornadoes), I chose to overlook that due to the fact that I am here for some fan-freaking-tastic tornado action. I came, I saw, and I enjoyed the twists and turns of this roller coaster ride so much so that I have watched this movie like 4 times in the past week.",1416355200,,839,4.562913907284768

It's just going to get worse.""  And then they have rednecks riding around on a 4 wheeler and in a Toyota Pickup which says ""Twista Hunterz"" on the back.

Stock characters, the vice principal of the school who lost his wife and his 2 sons that he adores but doesn't know how to be around them. The stormchasers, the leader just barks and scares his crew. Other minor appearances. The effects are pretty good and I say that with confidence.  the actors are all pretty good, too. This is just an action movie with no need for real stories and you don't get them. I would say not having any big names, they could put the budget to the effects. The 2 real acting standouts...there are 2, yes there are, the 2 young men playing the vice principals sons, Donnie played by Max Deacon and Trey played by Nathan Kress....both of these young men rose above and should be around for a bright future.

The best part about the movie was watching the tornadoes as they begin tearing everything up.  The special effects are very well done, and the EF 6 or 10 twister was very good!  I like this movie specifically for the tornadoes and the action of the actors who try to survive.  I will definitely be buying this movie either from Amazon.com, or from the store.

It is NOT a remake of Twister, as there was only one storm-chasing team, and they were more interested in cameras than gathering any useful weather data.  The main character was a high-school principal who wanted to rescue his son, the principal was played by Richard Armitage.  His acting was the best, I can't wait to see him in other things!  He was definitely the OTHER reason to watch this!  The script admittedly was so-so, but like I said you watch a movie like this for the action & special effects (and in my case, Richard!).",1416182400,,628,4.612612612612613

Too many times I read reviews of people that try to find plot holes, and this one has them... so many you'd think a tornado ripped through the plot. With these kind of movies, I like to go in, set down, and turn my mind off and just enjoy the thought (what if), enjoy the moment, and have fun for what the movie is and what the writer wanted you to see. If Twister hadn't came out years ago and spoiled us, made us look down on every tornado disaster movie since then... this would have been a great movie. So yeah... Twister it's not, but its a fun romp ""into the storm"" anyway.

The only reason i would give it a 4 is u really cant survive a storm like that; a bus full of people, and 2 drunk guys did. All they did was hide in a storm drain and block both ends off with a tractor trailer and a tank ""Storm Chaser"".

I also like the little references and similarities to Twister from 1996, which include the multiple vorticies encircling the cast, the tornado in the beginning taking place at night and is barely seen, the large F-5 tornado at the end, and one that I missed the first couple times I watched it: when the view changes from the news feed of the two massive tornadoes converging, and after Pete says, ""This is the largest tornado I've ever seen,"" and when it shows the tornado tossing debris ahead of them, you can see a fake cow come flying off  of the roof of what I assume is a dairy product manufacturing building. However, nothing will ever be better than Twister.

Although I didn't know any of the actors, I thought the casting was excellent.

The one weak spot was the inevitable single mother/drop-dead-gorgeous tornado  scientist; I could have done without that clich.  But the movie is so fast-paced, I didn't have time to dwell on negatives; I was completely caught up in the spectacle.

6373228,3,B00J9C07GC,"Pretend you didn't see ""Twister"" in 1996.

The producers of this movie are counting on it, since this is essentially the same screenplay minus the comedic elements.

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes a fresh re-envisioning can produce superior results. A recent example is the Nolan/Bale reboot of Batman - pulled from the wreckage that was George Clooney's ""nipples"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-atrocious-direction-of-Joel-Schumacher/dp/B001XVBGGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the atrocious direction of Joel Schumacher</a>.

For its time, Twister was a fantastic action/thriller, a major summer box office winner, and a very enjoyable popcorn-muncher. So tracing over that work should render a reasonable facsimile.

And that's exactly how I would define this movie - a very decent copy.

Follows the story of a research team, a.k.a Storm Chasers, that are about to experience a wholly unprecedented event - multiple storm fronts producing multiple F5 tornadoes. In the script, this would be the very first time this has happened since the United States started charting tornado activity in the mid-19th century.

Unfortunately, sitting dead center of the ""X"" of this bizarre meteorological convergence is a small city filled with families, homes, schools, businesses, and a main transportation hub for several airlines.

Will the team figure out what's happening in time to save the people - while still fulfilling their research goal of getting their specialized tornado-proof tank into the path of destruction?

Given the intense stress felt during several of the action sequences, I'm very tempted to go with a low four. But the fact that the filmmakers didn't incorporate one scintilla of a smile or an original plot - I'm going with a high three for the pure adrenaline rush.

Personal Note:

- I was stunned at the advertising budget for this flick.  A national tv campaign? That alone must've been $10-15 million bucks by itself. Unheard of for less than an expected blockbuster with A-list stars.

Impressed.

Of course, a major marketing campaign isn't necessarily a guaranteed ticket to blockbuster money - but impressed that a movie made up of mostly second-tier performers would rate this kind of effort.",1414195200,,2288,5.597101449275362
6373229,1,B00J9C07GC,"Ten minutes into Steven Quales Into the Storm, I came to the conclusion that found-footage films are cinemas answer to reality television - a cheap and easy sure buck designed to please the lowest common denominator audience, and nobody else. Luckily for filmmakers, the lowest common denominator audience is a big market.

When I walked into the theater, I had no idea this was a found-footage movie. I thought it was some kind of B-movie update on Twister, except Jan De Bont made Twister. Even that wasn't that great of a movie to begin with, but it did have a few things that worked.

""Into the Storm"" follows a widowed father and his two annoying teenage children, and a group of storm-catchers who document insane inclement weather for a living, and seem to have made some money at it. At a high school graduation, a terrifying storm involving the largest tornado youve likely ever seen arises and threatens the lives of everyone.

Some of the unknown actors look like better-known and better actors, but nobody gives a particularly good performance. Some of the acting is so bad, that it inspires unintended laughter. The characters are also paper-thin. There is absolutely nothing to them. No originality or depth to be found here. The characters are so uninspired that you almost find yourself rooting for the tornado to kill them all.

The one thing Into the Storm gets very right is the special effects. The largest tornado ever to be seen on film is absolutely gorgeous and terrifying. It feels like the filmmakers spent the proper amount of time editing the effects on this movie, but spent about a day writing the script and casting the movie.

So, in the end, if you're willing to go into a movie theater, and turn your brain off for an hour and a half, I suppose you could do worse than Into the Storm. You could, after all, see a Transformers movie. But if you like a little storytelling meat in your movies, stay away from this one. Maybe watch it for free on television, or take the DVD out of your local library like I should have. Its basically an ever so slightly more sophisticated Sharknado.

6373231,3,B00J9C07GC,"When you go to a film like ""Into the Storm"", you probably have some idea of what you are in for. The movie is marketed to highlight the special effects. That is your first clue that this is not a film that will be filled with Oscar caliber acting. It is a film sold on concept and because the filmmakers wanted show off the special effects they could conjure.

You, dear thornie (I feel I can call you that, devoted reader) might ask ""thornhill, didn't we already see this film when it was called ""Twister""?""

Yes. Yes, you did, dear thornie. In this day and age of almost constant remakes and reboots, I'm honestly surprised they didn't just call it ""Twister"", but I guess we can be grateful for the small things once in a while.

I have a special fondness for disaster films. When I used to work at a video store, I plowed through all of the Irwin Allen films that were available. Recently, I tried Warner Instant Archive, an online Warner Bros. archive containing many obscure films and television shows. The streaming service contains a couple of Irwin Allen television movies. The best thing about the entire canon of Allen's films? The numerous stars he lured to participate in these films. I was forever changed by watching a lava flow threaten Jaqueline Bisset in When Time Ran Out. He also subjected Fred Astaire to The Towering Inferno. All of his films are cookie cutter; a greedy person has done something that will threaten the ranks of B and C-list stars hired to fill out the ranks of the people who will soon die  they have built a cruise ship that is too big, a skyscraper that is too tall, a resort on an active volcanic island. Nothing is ready,but he wants to go ahead with the grand opening. Mr. Greedy always has a former second-in-command who quit because he knew trouble was coming. And that second-in-command is always in love with Mr. Greedys daughter. The fact they are so cookie cutter is part of their campy charm.

 When a new disaster film is released, you can pretty much count on finding me in the theater on opening weekend. And ""Into the Storm"" was no exception.

Directed by Steven Quale (""Final Destination 5"") and written by John Sweetman, ""Storm"" hits Silverton, a small town in Oklahoma. Gary (Richard Armitage, ""The Hobbit"", BBC's ""Robin Hood""), a recent widower and the Vice Principal of Silverton High School, has a lot on his plate getting everything ready for graduation. His two sons, Donnie (Max Deacon), a junior, and Trey (Nathan Kress), a sophomore, have been enlisted to video the ceremony and put together a tape of highlights. The relationship between father and sons is, shall we say, strained. Gary is also anxious because it doesn't look like the weather will hold out for the ceremony.

Meanwhile, a troop of storm chasers is getting desperate. They keep missing storms and their backer is threatening to pull out. This is making Pete (Matt Walsh), the director of the potential documentary, anxious and he is looking for his meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies, TV's ""The Walking Dead"") to work her magic and get them into the middle of a storm, so his multiple cameras and cameramen (stock characters all) will capture some amazing footage. Allison soon spots the storm headed for Silverton.

Movies like ""Into the Storm"" are nothing if not predictable. You know that going in, so the reason to go to a film like this is because of the effects. Storm is like ""Twister"" on speed. A lot of this is credited to the natural evolution of special effects, which can be more elaborate than they were ten years ago. Forget about cows flying through the air, ""Storm"" brews up just about every imaginable vehicle and throws them up, making them weapons. If you have seen the trailer, you know that the twisters eventually attack an airport and jets begin to twist and float into the air. There is a natural progression in a suspense film, and disaster films like this are really an extension of the suspense genre. They aren't going to start with the planes, they are going to start smaller and increase the danger, and suspense, to keep the viewer engaged.

It is also necessary to give the disaster elements a 'life', to make them a character. In ""Jurassic Park"", some of the dinosaurs are nice, others are very mean. You don't meet the mean creatures in the beginning and the nice beasts at the end. ""Into the Storm"", just like ""Twister"" before it, needs to make the tornadoes into characters. Because of the way Sarah Wayne Callies refers to them, they almost take on a more human feeling  Its moving, It should hit, Its gaining strength. And like any good villain, they are going to save the best stuff for last. Quale teases us with a storm that hits at night and builds the size and severity of the storm as the story continues. Soon, the twister breaks into four, one of them centers over a gas fire, sucking the flames up the entire length of the twister, etc.

In a film like this, you can also pretty much guess who will and who won't be killed and  in what order. You can also guess what sort of danger some of the characters will experience and who will be challenged to rescue them.

Like I said, you don't go to a film like this for anything but the special effects. And the special effects are good. There are a couple of moments when you feel like you are in the middle of the action. A few times, the special effects actually draw you out of the suspense, the fire up the tornado's length is a good example, because if a tornado is going to suck up some fire, it is also going to suck up one of the stock characters. When the guy comes into contact with the flames, it just isn't believable enough, which is surprising because you would expect all of the effects to be beyond critique.

The acting is also passable. Richard Armitage, a veteran of a lot of British television and ""The Hobbit"" films, is looking to become a leading man. ""Storm"" is an adequate showcase for his talents. Gary is a widower raising two teenage boys who are in the rebellious phase of their youth. He is naturally pretty glum and upset most of the time. I usually want to see a character arc in any film, but if Gary became more happy as the tornadoes begin to rip apart Silverton, it wouldn't seem natural. Sarah Wayne Callies has a little more material to work with. She has left her little daughter at home, so we witness a tearful conversation with the young girl. Her boss is also giving her a hard time and threatens to fire her. Both of these moments give her personal obstacles. The rest of the cast is made up of high-school kids, all pretty common stereotypes, and people on the storm chaser crew, all pretty common stereotypes.

The film also tries to make the actual framework of the story a little more interesting by making it a documentary. Because Gary's two sons are around, he has assigned them to make a video time capsule, interviewing their friends and getting their thoughts. They are also charged with taping the high school graduation and putting clips online. The storm chasers also have a plethora of cameras. A crew of ""Jackass"" wannabes are also trying to capture video of their high jinks and the tornado. The film uses all of this footage, interjecting a talking head here and there. I supposed this was done to capitalize on the now-passing success of the 'found footage' horror genre (""Paranormal Activity 1 - 100""). In ""Storm"", it is presented in a more polished way. It still takes some adjusting, but it does seem to fit the overall feel of the film.

Will ""Into the Storm"" make any '10 Best' lists? No. But it is fun in a corny, predictable way.",1412208000,5,7632,4.575402635431918
6373232,2,B00J9C07GC,"The idea of a disaster movie from the perspective of a set of camera--in much the same technique as a found footage movie--intrigued me enough to coerce me to a theater for a matinee showing of this middle profile flick that, for all extensive purposes, looked like a more expensive version of SyFy original movies like ""NYC: Tornado Terror"" or ""Icepocalypse: After Hell Freezes Over"".

Unfortunately, the idea of seeing a major natural disaster through the restricted eyes of various cameras is not used well through most of the film; when the film gets it's big moments, the camera gimmick is abandoned. Still, there's ample destruction, so if you're a disaster movie junkie like I am, this will ring your bell just fine during its brief run time.

The real problem here is the cast of characters we're forced to endure during all of this. If it isn't the high school kids that are still mourning a dead parent and rebelling against the other, the young girl who falls unexpectedly in love, the mother that feels inadequate as a parent, the two goofy redneck idiots, the inscrutable professional that only wants results no matter the cost or any of the other insufferable characters, it's an array of God awful side characters that do little more than scream and panic unintelligibly.

Considering this is the first major picture film that revolves around tornadoes since 1996's ""Twister"" and for the past 5 to 6 years the only natural disaster movies I have seen involving tornadoes were the ""not so good"" ones that air on SYFY. So I decided to go to the movies and give it a chance and boy...........I LOVED IT!!! I was so amazed with the graphics and the realism of the tornadoes and the realism of the sound of tornadoes and the realism of the damage just amazed me. ""Into The Storm"" kind of reminded me of Discovery channel's ""Storm Chasers"" cause the movie portray's some of the same mannerisms, some of the same objectives and some of the same equipment as the show.

You already know what's going to happen.

Anyway, ""Into The Storm"" delivers a decent story (but nothing we have already seen), good performances (LOVED Sarah Wayne Callies) and amazing special effects. It's just another disaster movie that follows the formula and it does okay.

 Thrill seekers searching for their adrenaline fix are watching the tornado flick Into the
Storm.  In it's structure Into the Storm follows tornado flick tradition.  The film's main characters video tape images of tornadoes for a living, storm chasers if you will.  A subplot involves a high school graduation ceremony that happens to be directly in the path of the storm.
 Richard Armitage plays Gary, the High School principal and father of two teenage boys.  We remember him from the two recent Hobbit movies.  The Doctor of Stromology among the storm chasers is played by Sarah Wayne Callies.  Fans will remember her from the hit TV show Walking Dead and regret along with me her screen death by hungry Zombies. The head of the storm chasers is a focused, ambitious and often heartless boss man played by Matt Walsh.  We know Walsh from his role as a staffer in the TV comedy Veep.  His role in Into the Storm has nothing comic about it.
 The young people in the film have yet to make their headlines but Alycia Debnam Carey, Max Deacon and Nathan Kress are attractive are show promise.  Kress as a very young actor voiced a puppy  in the charming 1998 film Babe: Pig in the City.
 Steven Quale directs on a script by John Swetnam.  Quale also directed the forgettable 2011 Final Destination 5.  Swetnam now has five writing credits on his sheet, none famous.
 Ho hum, you might think.  Think again.  The special effects are up to the latest high tech standards and are the best reason to see the film.  Even the sound, the strange noises created by the storm are outstanding.  Things bounce and fly around, thrown by the wind in terrifying realism.  We do have just enough character development to care if our on screen friends get blown to Oz or not, which is all we ask.  The director generously give us a transcendentally beautiful scene, a view literally over the top of the storm that he filmed with such subtle craft that it really made the whole film for me.  It lasted maybe 15 seconds.  Bravo Mr. Quale.
 This average three saw blade disaster flick carries a PG-13 rating for teens in multiple life threatening situations and various deaths by storm.  The dead people just die and do not suffer close ups of ruptured organs or other modern excesses.  I count Noah as a disaster film which if added to Into the Storm gives us only two in that genre this year.  Two is probably enough.  I don't remember any bad words but all the people kept their clothes on through out the film.
 Into the Storm lasts one hour and 29 minutes and when it was over I wanted to follow the characters a bit longer in their lives, a good sign.  Worldwide the film has taken in around $26 million of an ambitious budget of $50 million.  The film needs, by conventional rule of thumb, about $100 million to break even.  The producers must be feeling a little nervous.
 Do not compare this film to the 1996  Oscar nominated Twister with its brilliant cast and terrific script by Michael Crichton.
 They filmed Into the Storm in Michigan.  I have always been a bit afraid of tornadoes and blame the fear on the flickers.

6373243,4,B00J9C07GC,"Into the Storm is in a nutshell Twister updated for the YouTube generation. Like Jan de Bonts 1996 disaster action drama, Into the Storm features intense tornadoes, and in the new film you will see them hitting the fictional town of Silverton, Oklahoma. And this time the storm is much bigger, with more than one EF4 (and 5) tornado.

But don't expect anything new in the story. The characters are largely cardboard stereotypes, including the vice-principal of the local high school Gary Morris (Richard Armitage) with his two sons Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress), plus a veteran storm chaser Pete (Matt Walsh) and a meteorology expert Dr. Allison Stone (Sarah Wayne Callies) who assists him. Also, there are two thrill seekers, or sort of comic relief, without which the film would be even better.

The strongest part of the film is not surprisingly the thrilling tornado scenes. Director Steven Quale (Final Destination 5) knows how to rivet the audience's attention with the stunning visuals and slick editing. Into the Storm employs the overused device of found footage, but the film cleverly avoids using the shaky camera, keeping the thrills intact.
