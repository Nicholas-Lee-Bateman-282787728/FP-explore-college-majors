5893657,5,B00E6PUYUG,"I bought this for a gift and was able to view it also. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting to continue watching. It is based on the depression era which is why I thought it would be good. It is just the everday struggles common people live through, hopes, dreams. The period of time we are in now for most common people looking for work.",1393286400,5,351,4.0285714285714285
5893658,5,B00E6PUYUG,"Yes, love it.",1482624000,,13,3.6666666666666665
5893659,5,B00E6PUYUG,Wind at my Back is a fantastic series to watch with the entire family.  My family enjoyed watching this series on TV.  We decided to add the complete series set to our collection of DVDs so we could watch it at our leisure over and over again.,1481068800,,243,4.148936170212766
5893660,5,B00E6PUYUG,It portrays the problems and family life that exists today.  I will definitely recommend it.,1478304000,,92,5.133333333333334
5893661,5,B00E6PUYUG,"Holy cow, I got just as involved with characters as with the Anne series. 5 star. It is a different time, so be patient after watching Avonlea series. Characters really grow on you. Big kudos to Sullivan.  I really enjoyed kevin discussing each season on the 1st DVD of each of 5 seasons. Really great.",1477094400,3,302,4.490909090909091
5893662,5,B00E6PUYUG,"LOVE, LOVE LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!! DVD's are brand new,  awesome quality, fast shipping!",1476230400,,84,5.461538461538462
5893663,4,B00E6PUYUG,"This is the kinda high quality stuff you expect from the Sullivan company. Interesting stories, drama, wit and humor, sweet romance, and lots of fiesty old ladies. It's basically a more depressing, more annoying 1930s version of the Avonlea show. With really dumb names like Fat and Toppy.
The first 3 seasons are definitely the strongest. But the only season I really didn't like was the last one. Honey became rude and unreasonable, much less likeable than previously, and for some odd reason the writers decided to have Grace rush into a miserable marriage with a con artist instead of marrying Jim Flett ( the only really appealing boyfriend she'd ever had). That seriously annoyed me. Plus they needed to finish off the show quickly so we don't even see all the plot lines concluded.
The 2 most unlikeable characters were Del and Alice. Del was very realistic and not shown too sentimentally so episodes featuring him are pretty good. Alice episodes are weaker-- her life story is a sad one, but she still comes across as a selfish brat with huge, dated 1990s lips. Hub could do so much better. Very thankful they didn't end up married.
Recommended. Just pretend Grace married Jim Flett.",1474070400,,1192,4.819512195121951
5893664,5,B00E6PUYUG,I love these series even if it old but oldies are the best!!,1471305600,,60,3.6923076923076925
5893665,5,B00E6PUYUG,"This show is a classic!!!! It shows how family and love even in the worst of times can carry us through. I wish there more stories like this on tv for people to watch and to understand how hard life has been in the past. It helps to put our own lives in perspective. No generation has ever had it easy but as long as we are willing to keep trying, in the end no matter where we find ourselves, we will be stronger for experience. Love the characters as they develop with each show.",1466985600,2,481,4.073684210526316
5893666,5,B00E6PUYUG,"I think this rivaled the happiest day of my life (seriously) to be able to enjoy this wonderful series that has gotten a short shrift on our American airways.  Yes,it's a Canadian import, but at no expense to actor's ability (the great Shirley Douglas ((mother of Keifer Sutherland)) the wonderfully written scripts, but be forewarned, it pulls at all your heartstrings.  Amazing acting by the young people (Dylan Provencher and Tyrone Savage) makes you wish they were your grandchildren!  And it's not short in the romance department with Max Sutton and Honey Bailey and his brother Del (Hearthrobbingly played by Ron Lea) and Grace Bailey!  Now I can enjoy this whenever and not depend on a station to run parts of it, jump from one season to another!",1464998400,6,753,4.859375

5893668,5,B00E6PUYUG,Watching this one is like reading a good book. You just want to watch the next episode right away.  6/5* for me. The Matriarch is a love to hate character that really makes it interesting in the story.,1462838400,,201,4.2894736842105265

5893673,5,B00E6PUYUG,This is a wonderful series that is family friendly and worth buying and watching but I would recommend buying all 5 seasons separately because you will save yourself a little over $50.,1441670400,5,184,4.78125

8602184,5,B00E6PUYUG,Wonderful family series set in one of the most interesting historical periods of Canada/America.  Sorry that it ended too soon as we will never find out what happened to the characters that we grew to love.  Hope that the film industry sits up and takes note that people are tired of the senseless movies and sitcoms that portray the family in a degrading manner - we need more series like Wind At My Back!,1507593600,,406,4.472972972972973
