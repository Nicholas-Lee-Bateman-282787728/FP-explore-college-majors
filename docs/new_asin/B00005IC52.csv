1426461,5,B00005IC52,this has to be the BEST horror movie ever ...I saw it years ago and never did forget it...I have seen about every horror movie there is!...and there is nothing that will scare you more than this one!.....make sure your not alone when you watch it!...get the 25th Ann.

1426462,3,B00005IC52,"The film is a classic...but this is just to note that this version of the DVD is apparently the EXACT same disc as the Canadian import that is available, just re-distributed. It was reported months ago that this would be a widescreen presentation release from Music Video Distributors, but sadly, it is not. Hopefully this film will one day get the release on DVD it deserves.",1007078400,5,376,4.712121212121212
1426463,5,B00005IC52,"Oh man, where do I start?  This film is one of my favorite horror films.  It has the right mixture of horror, suspense, and comedy.  It also has small amounts of gore (well, by today's standards) which is a good thing to some viewers.
The plot of the film is simple.  It takes place at a sorority house/boarding school around Christmas time.  A crazed killer finds his way into the attic of the house and starts making obscene phone calls from the second phone line.  Then, he starts offing the inhabitants of the house one by one.  Olivia Hussey stars as the film's heroine and Keir Dullea co-stars as her misunderstood love interest... but Margot Kidder steals the show as Hussey's drunken, foul mouthed friend.  A very young Andrea Martin (of SCTV fame) is also in the film.
This film inspired elements of the Scream movies, When A Stranger Calls, and countless others.  I recommend it to anyone who loves a good scary movie.",1004140800,14,928,4.609756097560975
1426464,5,B00005IC52,"GREAT MOVIE! ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER! IF YOU LIKED THIS, YOU MUST SEE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS-STARRING SALLY FIELDS.AWESOME!",1003363200,2,133,5.090909090909091
1426465,5,B00005IC52,"Probably one of the best thrillers of this type I've ever seen, and unfortunately, one of the more obscure films of the 70's. It involves a sorority house and a killer that's crept up into the attic. The only girls left in the house are the ones that haven't departed for the holidays, and eventually they regret that decision. Initially, the campaign of terror begins with a series of ghoulish prank calls. The caller, speaking in about twenty different voices---or identities---is absolutely koo-koo for Coco Puffs; the calls vary between filth and death threats. This inevitably leads to the horror formula where the killer is ""calling from inside the house"" which remains a kind of creepy medium even after thirty years. As it moves on at a reasonably fast pace, the movie of course points you towards probable suspects. In the meanwhile, the bodies are piling up. Eventually, the in-house protagonist list gets streamlined down to the prettiest of the girls, who has yet to realize that most of her friends are dead upstairs. Specific comments made during the prank calls soon convince her that the killer is her own jilted boyfriend, who seems a likely enough suspect. Underlying everything is a morbid sense of humor, that slanted kind of Chainsaw Massacre humor. I don't want to ruin the movie for any first-timers, so without hinting at the nature or identity of the killer, I'll just say that I recommend this movie highly. In years to come, this kind of film became most frequently replaced by straight out slasher movies with little or no suspense behind them. Dark thrillers such as Black Chistmas should be enjoyed for the rarities they are.",998956800,4,1655,4.893238434163701
1426466,5,B00005IC52,"I first saw Black Christmas in 1984.  I was a fan of horror movies but had no idea that they came as good as this.  the atmosphere it creates is overwhelming.  It is as much horrifying as it is eeeeeeerie.  It is without a doubt in my mind the most brillaint horror film I have seen.  Sure, Halloween has special moments too, but this movie is so much more - why?  It doesnt contain those stereo-type boogie men.  Sure there is a killer but he isn't wlaking around with a mask on.  Black Christmas succeeds in that it makes the viewer hang on to the edge of the seat.  All you want to do is yell at those people to get out of the house. I promise you, you will love this movie.  I have had no luck locating it in video hire shops (out of print), so will buy my own copy. Watch it in the dark!",992995200,,792,3.9556962025316458
1426467,5,B00005IC52,"This is a great horror movie. When watching it remember it was done before Halloween and the slasher films of the 80's. I am 38 and remember this movie and was thrilled to see it on DVD. The story(original at the time) still holds up, the atmosphere is creepy as hell and the acting is pretty good, especially Margot Kidder. Has some slow spots but the last part is really well paced and the ending is disturbing,if not predictable. Overall a very good movie,watch it with When A Stranger Calls for a decent theme night.",992217600,,520,4.484210526315789
1426468,5,B00005IC52,"I have searched 15 years for a decent print of this great movie. It is absolutely astonishing how Bob Clark's truly terrifying masterpiece Black Christmas - a pioneering horror flick - has faded from the minds of moviegoers. A suspense sensation on its initial release in the early 1970s, Black Christmas is without doubt a must-have for all horror movie collectors. Starring cutie pie Olivia Hussey - fresh from her success in Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet - and a groovy Margot Kidder - fresh from her horror success in De Palma's Sisters, Black Christmas is the forgotten forerunner of the slasher genre that would spawn later classics like Halloween and Scream...But the staple conventions of the slasher movie: virginal heroine; promiscuous victims; psychopathic stalker; subjective camera; ambiguous ending are all established in THIS movie...And as for the ""harassment by phone / caller is in the house"" scenario that everyone thinks comes from When a Stranger Calls - it all started here. As a fan of all these movies, I can tell you Black Christmas is definitely the scariest of the lot. The story of a demented madman stalking the sisters of a college sorority house, the movie quickly ratchets up to 10 on the suspense-o-meter and sustains it to the end with a series of truly evil murders and unforgettable horror images. From the eye in the door crack; the plastic-bagged corpse; the rocking chair; the house mother yanked off her feet into the ceiling; Bob Clarke hits all the right notes to seal his place as a one-hit wonder of the genre. But what a hit it is. Pure, efficient terror at its most extreme. A great, scary date movie you will not watch alone, I rate it as one of the five scariest movies of all time...I guarantee you'll be watching it over and over to share it terrors with friends and family out for a real scare. Suspense brilliance that has rarely been equalled. Respect!",987724800,5,1905,4.810975609756097

1426505,5,B00005IC52,"NOTE: This is for the Scream Factory Collector's Edition, released in 2016/2017. Look under the reviewer name to see what version they are reviewing, or go to verified purchases and set what you want. Otherwise, you are looking at every release ever and people's thoughts on them, plus random commentary on the movie itself.

This is not a movie review, you can find plenty of them, but more commentary on the new release.

Shout/Scream Factory is the best thing to happen to horror movies. Really, without them, we would be missing so many movies outright, and their transfers are phenomenal. That is the bright point with Black Christmas; in the past, watching this movie meant tuning into really dark darks and blurry compositions, which hurt the movie in the eyes of a lot of people. I had, for example, shown it to people and their takeaway was impacted by the older transfer's lack of quality. Scream Factory fixes that with this 2K scan from the negative itself.

On the two-disc Collector's edition, you have the normal addition of the reversible slipcover, which allows the newer cover art of their commissioned picture. Personally, I like them both and I always like seeing how they display the movie years after-the-fact. Aside from the 2K scan (which I cannot say enough about, because it remedies so many darkness issues), the first disc includes 3 audio tracks (producer/director Bob Clark, actors Keir Dullea and John Saxon, and Nick Mancuso as Billy). I always like those, because they give you a feel about movies from before everything was cataloged. Disc Two includes an interview with Art Hindle, The 12 Days of Black Christmas documentary, Black Christmas Revisited, Black Christmas Legacy, On Screen: Black Christmas, Archival interviews, the theatrical trailer, tv and radio spots, and more.

Scream Factory gives you a LOT on their movies (their release of The Thing, for example, is the best movie I have ever seen when it comes to extras), and I think they did a lot with this. The 2K scan alone makes it well worth considering.",1489363200,16,2054,4.910662824207493

I held off on reviewing this Blu-Ray release until Shout Factory fixed the audio issues on the mono track, but now that I have received the replacement disc, I am excited to recommend this outstanding restoration of one of the seminal slasher movies.  I especially love those gaudy 1970s Christmas lights in the excellent 2K rendering of this superlative horror film.

1426552,5,B00005IC52,"Christmas break is coming up at a university and a certain sorority house has an unwelcome visitor. The young women are busy with their Christmas parties and packing up to visit family. Their festivities are interrupted by the disappearance of one of the sorority sisters named Clare and numerous anonymous obscene phone calls. The women try to go to the police, but no one listens to them. When a young girl is found murdered near the school, the police finally take them seriously and consider that the events are all related. Is it too late to save the rest of the sorority sisters?

Black Christmas is credited as the first American slasher film, a full four years before Halloween that is usually seen as the first. Black Christmas has many aspects in common with slasher films, but some with a different spin than usual like the victims, the killer, and the resolution. The group of women being stalked are older than the usual high school students. These women are more self assured, more intelligent, and much less naive. The stereotypical final girl is virginal, sweet, and does almost nothing wrong. Clare would be the final girl in any other slasher with her virginal innocence, but she's the first to die. The other women can be quite crass, sexually active, and unapologetic about their decisions, which is a refreshing change from the usual ditzy high schoolers. They all are genuine friends which is shown in quiet moments of caring between the women. It was nice to see women I could cheer for instead of ones I cheered the slasher for murdering.

My two favorite characters are Barbara and Jess. Barbara, portrayed by Margot Kidder, has a spiky exterior. She tells things like it is and isn't afraid to clap back at people with sarcasm or cruelty. I love her interaction with the dismissive police officer that offered some much needed comic relief. Her life is much more painful than she lets on, shown in a phone conversation where her mother doesn't want to spend the holidays with her. Barbara is flawed, but strong. Jess is just as strong with a lot more tact. She takes care of her friends but also stands firm in the face of oppostion. She recently found out she was pregnant by her boyfriend Peter and already firmly decided to have an abortion. When her boyfriend goes from incredulous to angry, her decision stands firm because she has her own hopes and dreams that she doesn't want to give up no matter how many times her pleads or threatens. Even now, this portrayal of Jess's unapologetic decision to abort is a rarity that should be seen much more often after 40 years. Both women are flawed but strong individuals that I hoped would survive the film.

The men in the film treat the sorority sisters with disdain and dismissiveness. Peter is the worse offender as he tries to pressure Jess into keeping her baby and marrying him. His behavior is disgusting and abusive. He threatens her, insults her, pleads with her, and then decides they should get married. He tells her he is leaving the conservatory and they will get married. No asking, just telling. This occurs after he destroys a beautiful piano belonging to the school. The police are slightly better, but that's not saying much. They don't take a missing girl or obscene phone calls seriously even though it might be tied to another local girl missing. The only decent man in the film is Lt. Kenneth Fuller who sees the connection between all the suspicious events and calls on Jess to help catch the killer.

The killer in this film is interesting. He is never seen clearly. An eye is shown through a crack in the door, his shadow and hands are seen, and his voice is heard. Most of his action are shown through a first person camera from his perspective, allowing us to see through his eyes. He's a disturbing figure for a number of reasons. Not only is he a murderer, but the way he rocks and sings to Clare's body is incredibly disturbing. His ravings and different voices (possibly suggesting multiple personalities) are chilling to listen to as he shouts, squeals, tantrums, and sings. He stays inside the house right from the first scene of the film and the girls have no idea. He stores bodies in the attic and they are never discovered despite not bothering to hide them. There's no logical reason for him to be targeting these women like in other slashers. It's a completely random series of crimes that could happen to anyone which conceptually is more frightening than the reasons for other slashers.

While Halloween stays firm on the top of my list of favorite films, Black Christmas proves itself to be a hidden gem that goes largely unrecognized for its merits. I find it interesting that even before conventions were in place for this genre, this film went in the opposite direction. The main characters are older, more established women. The killer isn't an iconic figure, but someone hidden and raving. The ending is incredibly bleak that makes this film all the more chilling. My only issues with the film are some bad decisions made by Jess and the police that were uncharacteristic near the end and the lackluster music. Black Christmas will definitely be in my rotation of yearly Christmas films because of the incredible characters, insanely scary villain, and unexpected ending.",1482969600,2,5294,4.756256800870512

more of a Psychological thriller than an actual Horror/slasher film there's hardly no Blood or Gore in the film
so it's more suspense thriller with some kill scenes in it basically & the kill scenes are more for shock thrill no Blood or Gore
 so don't believe the Hype that the film is a big slasher film cause it definitely isn't
well Anchor bay reissued the film on blu-ray about 1 year ago as Seasons Grievings edition
Anchor bay didn't give the film a new HD transfer they just recycled the old 2008 Transfer which looks terrible
so Scream factory now have got the rights and reissued the film with new 2k HD scan over a 2 Disc blu-ray set
and i tell you the 1:85:1 2k scan looks beautiful no Grain no Dirt very nice colour restoration the best the film has ever looked
much better transfer than the Anchor bay blu-ray anyday
the sound quality is the same 5.1 master mix here's the Details
Disc 1 has the new 1:85:1 2k HD transfer & the 5.1 master mix
plus the usual 3 Commentary tracks carried over from the old Anchor bay release
Disc 2 has the 2006 Critical mass HD master in 1:78:1 ratio with 5.1 master audio mix
with the rest of the extras
new interview with Actor Art Hindle, new interview with Actress Lynne Griffin

1426571,5,B00005IC52,"Seeing how this is meant to be a review for the latest Scream Factory Blu-ray of Black Christmas, I should probably tackle the biggest issue that is rearing its ugly head right now: the Mono soundtrack. It didn't take long for people to notice an issue in the mono track, which Ill admit is very noticeable. Anytime someone says something with an S word, the audio hisses pretty badly. Scream Factory has responded to the complaints, citing the issue was in the optical track they received. Nevertheless, others have pointed out that issue didn't exist in past releases that used the mono track.

Okay, so it definitely is a problem for people that want to experience the movie in original Mono. Scream Factory, however, has added a DTS Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0 track. Unfortunately, many people think they are terrible. You see, the new 5.1/2.0 tracks have added in modern sounds like stabbings, door opening sounds and door banging. Terrible, terrible stuff I guess. You see, when I started up the movie, I listened to the Mono track and thanks to the people that complained, I couldn't help but not hear the hissing sounds. To fix it, I switched over to the 5.1 track and lo and behold, the track did not bother me in the least bit. In fact, I loved it. I did go back and compare the two tracks to see the differences and yes, there has been changes done to the sound effects, but nothing that ruins my enjoyment of this classic holiday slasher.

Having said all that, Im going to stop right there for now and switch this review over to the movie and Ill get back to the Blu-ray once Im done that.

Movie Review

Raise your hand if you haven't seen Bob Clarks Canadian cult classic Black Christmas. If you happened to raise your hand; shame! Shame! Shame! Black Christmas, released in 1974, is the precursor to that other cult classic slasher Halloween.  Sure, Mario Bava was already doing some slasher/Giallo stuff over in Italy, but so far in North America, we didn't have much POV slasher mayhem going around (do we count Psycho?). It took Bob Clark to come along and direct a slasher masterpiece taking place around some peoples most favourite time of the year to get things moving.

Its Christmas time at a sorority house and the lucky ones have gone home for the holidays. There are only a few that have stayed around and unlucky for them, there is a killer hiding in their attic, who loves to call them up and make obscene phone calls. As the girls get knocked off one by one, the only victim left is Jess (Olivia Hussey,) who is hoping the police, led by John Saxon, will figure out exactly who is making these phone calls (they still don't know anyone is dead). As the night goes on and the calls keep coming, Jess fears she may not see another Christmas again.

If you're a fan of open ended movies, youll fall in love with this one.

Black Christmas has all the right ingredients for a classic slasher flick, even if Director Bob Clark saw this movie as more of a psychological thriller instead. Its got the mysterious killer stalking the hallways and attic. Its got some pretty cool kills and plenty of creepy moments to give you goosebumps (that eye in the door jamb scene is truly hair-raising). The subtle music by Carl Zittrer keeps things low key and tense, never making the soundtrack go overly bombastic, which allows the films tension to breathe and rely on subtle creaks and whispers in the shadows to keep the dread running high.

Olivia Hussey also plays the last woman standing with great gusto. Her screams fill the speakers and she really sells the fear at the end. We also get to enjoy some light brevity at the police station with John Saxons character lamenting the choices in police officers working there. And if the phone tracking scenes with their outdated technology don't have you on the edge of your seat, you better check your pulse.

Is there anything to not like in Black Christmas? Personally, I find the film to be near perfect. As previously mentioned, people may not like the ending, but I found it absolutely brilliant.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Do I need to mention the audio issues again? Scream Factory is taking a beating with this one, with people demanding a recall and replacement program. I just going to shake my head and enjoy my copy. Im not going to judge the people that want perfection, but to spend money on a replacement program is lunacy.

I want you to step back and look at exactly what Scream Factory has done for this Blu-ray release. They have provided not one, but two transfers. The first is the absolutely stunning new 2K transfer that is mind blowing in how cleaned up the film looks. There are obviously still issues here and there, but when comparing it to all other past releases, especially the included Critical Mass transfer, this one stands above the rest.

I haven't even got to the special features, with a second disc jammed full of them. Yes, there are only two new interviews included, but they are enjoyable. The real highlight here, though, is the inclusion of all past special features. Im talking multiple commentaries, featurettes, interviews and trailers. This is one release where you can sit back and bask in the glory of how Black Christmas came to be and how its legacy lives on.

VERDICT

Black Christmas, the cult classic slasher that really did inspire Halloween. The ending, if you enjoyed it, will stick with you for a very long time and will still have you asking the question of who exactly was Billy. Scream Factory spent a lot of time and money on getting this release out to the masses. They have gone above and beyond in my personal opinion and in the end, I say forgive the Mono track issue and buy this damn Blu-ray.",1481760000,,5716,4.594700686947988
1426572,5,B00005IC52,"Scream Factory has done a terrific transfer. The picture and sound are great. Blacks are black, not near as washed out and grainy as the previous release. I think they covered all the previous extras along with a couple new interviews. Finally, I would say this is the definitive edition. I have had issues with previous Scream (Shout!) Factory releases- Piranha (wanted 5.1 DTS HD MA), Halloween II & The Howling & The Fog (would've liked a 2K scan or at least better restored blacks), Carrie (with a 4K scan I was expecting PQ closer to Jaws or the recent Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan BD), The Exorcist III (a better director's cut or maybe just a different cut including the cut f/x shots- the beheaded priest in the confessional and the morphing head of patient X going from Father Karras to the Gemini killer to the demon or Satan.) But, I am really happy with Psycho II, Child's Play, and now Black Christmas with no complaints. And even though some minor gripes about the aforementioned titles, overall satisfied with them. Now, they need to come out with a CE of Jaws 2 in 5.1 DTS HD MA. Hopefully in 2017. Oh, and a restored 5.1 DTS HD MA 4K scan of 1986's The Hitcher and I'll be set as far as my favorite older horror films.",1481587200,,1238,4.4104803493449785
1426573,5,B00005IC52,"Scream Factory has gotten a lot of flack for this Black Christmas collector's edition Blu-Ray despite the fact they've included two different versions of the film in a double-disc package, one of them being a new 2k scan of the film. I'll address the new video, and we'll move on to the controversy surrounding the release.

The new 2k scan frankly looks amazing, and Scream Factory has done an excellent job with the new transfer. A title card at the beginning of the film describes the process, noting that there has been no digital enhancement of the image; the heavier grain has been left intact, which means that some scenes - especially dark ones - have a slightly noisy look to them which is authentic to the film itself, which has sustained damage over the years. However, even with some heavy grain presence, the film has never looked better. The red colors especially pop from the picture, most noticeable on Jess' red scarf or Mrs. Mac's nails. There's much better contrast in darker scenes, and details are much more prevalent in the picture. The aspect ratio has been corrected as well, offering a 1.85:1 picture that looks fantastic. One can compare this new scan to the Critical Mass one done in 2006 thanks to Scream Factory's inclusion of that release on the special features Blu-Ray disc; the difference is enormous in some scenes.

But the video isn't the problem on this disc; rather, it's the audio. Scream Factory has given viewers three different audio options (not counting the four audio commentary tracks) for their listening experience; one is a 5.1 track that is the same reconstructed track featured on the Critical Mass release, which was problematic for many fans because of changes to the sound effects and music cues. For this reviewer, I don't have a problem with the 5.1 mix at all - honestly, I think it sounds rather good in stereo - but I certainly do see the issue that fans have with the subtle changes to the track.

There's also a 2.0 track which is the same as the 5.1, offering the same reconstructed sounds. That one's probably going to have very few fans, because in general most will opt for the 5.1 or go for this disc's most controversial offering: the original mono track. Now, most people would probably not care about a regular mono track on many releases, but for Black Christmas the mono track is important because it maintains the original sound effects unaltered like the 5.1 track. However, Scream Factory's mono track features some sibilant problems, with a static swoosh whenever actors speak any S words. This is most apparent in chapter 2 during a series of sibilant sounds.

Scream Factory has come under fire for this mono track since fans were really looking forward to hearing the original mono. This reviewer totally gets the frustration - the hissing static is certainly a problem. However, it is absolutely not ""unlistenable"" as I have heard some people describe this mono track; in most scenes, it's relatively unnoticeable. This is a case of some fans making a mountain out of a molehill, and I would be sincerely disappointed to see ""fans"" of the film canceling their orders because of a small, but admittedly problematic, mono track. Does this require Scream Factory to issue new discs correcting the issue? Probably not. Rather a simple explanation - which they have already discussed - is all that's needed.

It's easy to overlook this flaw because the rest of the release is so excellent. Scream Factory has worked very hard to include all extras from previous releases, including archival interviews, various documentaries, the aforementioned four audio commentary tracks, two new scenes featuring slightly altered audio, and even two new interviews with Art Hindle and Lynn Griffin. It's an immense package, especially with the two different film versions, and ultimately this collector's edition offers hours of extras packed onto two discs. It is simply a must-have item for fans and collectors; and if the mono bothers you to the point where you won't order this, then I think you need to reassess your fanaticism for the film.",1481500800,3,4107,4.886657101865136

1426614,5,B00005IC52,"This is a classic movie.  Most folks would refer to it as a ""cult"" classic because of it's low budget but it's nothing more than a very good mystery well directed with wonderful acting.  I would put this movie up there with Psycho in that it was the first of it's type and started a new genre of films, the ""slasher"" movies, which showed gore to enhance the drama.  The reality is, the actual gore only takes place one time and it's during one of the best ever directed scenes in cinema, in my opinion.

Whenever there is a successful movie, you will see tons of imitations come onto the scene to cash in on the success.  Black Christmas is that movie that started the whole genre of ""scream queen"" movies.  But not only was it a first modern ""scary"" movie, it was also well directed with a logical storyline and good foreshadowing without being too obvious.  The ambiguities deliberately fit the storyline rather than being poor story telling.

The plot is fairly simple.  At Christmas break, a sorority college student goes missing and, at the same time, the sorority house is receiving prank phone calls.  The viewers know she has been murdered but the question is by whom.  Because most people are leaving the school over the Christmas break, when someone disappears it it assumed they simply went to visit family.

The actors are well accomplished:  Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin.  It's a shame that many people will half pay attention to this while watching because every line and every scene adds something to the plot that helps clue you in to what is happening.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a convoluted plot, but it does need to be followed closely to get the most out of the story.

When I first heard of this movie it was titled ""Stranger in the House"" and I continue to put this in the top five of all time thrillers.  Psycho, The Ring are a couple others that come to mind.",1451433600,,1933,4.524495677233429
1426615,3,B00005IC52,"The characters in Black Christmas annoyed me. The characters appeared as stupid and obnoxious. After the harassing phone calls, tapping the phone wires, and the investigation, no one caught the serial killer, Billy.

The movie trailer, phone calls, music, the red herring character (Jess' boyfriend Peter), Billy's Doberman colored eyes peeping through the door, his hidden appearance, and the camera angles, pans, and zooms were creepy. Otherwise, Black Christmas didn't frighten me. I was highly disappointed. I guess ""my skin IS on too tight.""

1426618,5,B00005IC52,"I admit that I was a latecomer to this 1974 Christmas horror/slasher classic.  I first saw it nearly 10 years ago as I rented it at a Blockbuster Video store.  At first, let's just say that this movie and its merits didn't quite sink in right away, but over time I have learned to embrace it for all that it has to offer.

For the newcomer(s); the basic gist is this: Black Christmas(aka Stop Me,aka Silent Night, Evil Night,  aka Stranger in the House) is a Canadian psychological horror/Christmas slasher.  It stars such familiar faces such as John Saxon(Enter the Dragon, Tenebrae, A Nightmare on Elm Street), Margot Kidder[Superman's 1-4(1978-1987) Amityville Horror(1979)] Olivia Hussey(Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet(1968) Psycho IV: The Beginning, Stephen King's It) and Andrea Martin(Tv's Saturday Night Live).  Also,it was directed by Bob Clark(A Christmas Story, Poky's, Porky's II, From the Hip, Baby Genuises 1&2).
The movie centers around a group of sorority sisters who are having a Christmas party as they receive a series of phone calls both obscene and freakishly eerie, from a mysterious psycho named Billy of whom hides in their attic intermittently killing random victims of his choosing.

Some Facts about the Movie:  It was released in theaters in Canada on October 11, 1974 and on December 20, 1974 in American theaters.  It's budget was $620,000.  It grossed $4,053,000 in the box office.  Besides being the director Bob Clark also was the producer of this film as well.  The music was by Carl Zittrer. It was distributed by Ambassador Film Distributers in Canada and Warner Bros. in the U.S..  The cinematography was done by Reginald H. Morris.  Both Nick Mancuso and Bob Clark play the prowler intended as Billy and also they both are Billy's phone voice.  Finally,It was shot on location over an eight week period in Toronto, Ontario.

This movie is one creepy and just plain frightening horror/slasher.  The POV shots[later used for Friday the 13th(1980) and often used by Dario Argento] were effectively frightening as they were one thing to keep Billy's identity well hid.  Also, that camera method has an effective way of making the viewer feel as though their the killer.  The atmosphere is quite grim the way that it's snowy and the college town that it takes place in seems to be out in the middle of nowhere.  The night scenes are beautifully shot and with this new transfer are easier to make out.  The day scenes are beautifully shot also.  The way that the sorority girls are completely vulnerable in and not at all safe in their sorority house is one very frightening concept.  Especially since they have no idea as to who Billy is, the fact that he's hiding in the attic, let alone when he'll strike next.  The whole psychological terror element is brilliantly handled to the total feeling of unease throughout.  The cops are baffled, their house mother is a lowly alcoholic, and furthermore some of the sorority girls have personal problems that conflict with one another.  Given all of that their struggles are many.

The whole Christmas horror sub-genre had not been done a lot with so this movie was quite special in further developing it further.  Billy's voice(s) over the phone proved very chilling to the bone scary.  While there's not much gore in this movie, the kill scenes proved quite different and classically done all in all.  The favorite kill is definitely the stabbing with a crystal unicorn statue.

Sexy actresses Margot Kidder and Olivia Hussey made for great eye-candy and showed pleasing sex appeal. Furthermore they definitely put in some intriguing performances.  Unfortunately there's no nudity.

John Saxon was great as Lt. Kenneth Fuller.  It was interesting to see him play a cop 10 years before he did in A Nightmare on Elm Street, also.  Sergeant Nash(Doug McGrath) made for some pretty good comic relief since he such an idiot cop.

Overall, while this isn't a particularly gory slasher, what it does provide the audience with is some brilliantly creepy first person camera POV, some interesting kill scenes, a little comic relief, a dreary and isolating atmosphere with its snow and it being in a small college town, no predictable moments, attractive people, suspense that's slow at first but is effectively nerve-racking, a freakishly frightening killer who's completely mysterious, and above all Billy has neither a particular pattern to whom he'll kill nor when.  If you're into psychological horror, Christmas horror/slashers,  creepy atmosphere,  and clever killers that can elude anyone even the cops, than this movie is definitely for you.
P.S. It's awesome to have this on Blu-ray finally.",1449964800,4,4677,5.024675324675325

In some ways, this movie reminds me of the Halloween 1978 movie, as the telephone is a prominent feature. Furthermore, it has the teenybopper/young adult element. This movie also has a few notable actors (Margot Kidder and Keir Dullea) who bring some balance and credibility. Casting Dullea seems Keir-oius, as it's a bit surprising that he would accept a role in a B type of movie after he found mainstream success in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If anything, it's noble that he didn't think that being in this movie was beneath him.

After watching it again several days ago for some reason I came to the conclusion that there were actually two killers in the house, one unknown and then Peter who snapped because Jess wanted an abortion and didn't want to get married. Phone calls were all from the first who picked up on information discussed in the house. The child's murder in town is a coincidence and unrelated. I had to watch it again to really see how plausible this two-murderer theory could be, but it really doesn't hold up. The ""clues"" do seem to point to Peter -- ie. specific reference to the abortion by the caller, the deadpan comment about Claire being fine, the fact that Peter knew that Jess was in the basement and showed up right after the killer left. On the other hand, supposedly having just viciously stabbed someone, apparently no blood on him. Unfortunately, the ending is kind of weak -- even small town police forces in the 70s couldn't be so incompetent not to search the house entirely and to leave a traumatized person alone in a house where two known brutal murders took place.

Except for the ending, which did surprise me, it was a somewhat predictable horror film. Overall I thought the movie was slow, but it did have a few (not many) moments of suspense. Overall the acting was fine, although Olivia Hussey got on my nerves and at times I was hopping the killer would get her.
 SPOILER ALERT. At the end, Olivia's boyfriend is believed to be the killer and Olivia, thinking she is going to be the next victim, kills him with a poker. Later Olivia is sleeping in her room, the police and everyone else has left her alone. There does appear to be 1 person outside of the house guarding the front door. The real killer (who you never see except for his hands and eyes) re-enters the attic where 2 of his victims are still where he left them. I don't have a problem with them not telling you who the real killer is. But I did find it odd that the police wouldn't have searched the attic where they would have found 2 of the murder victims and leaving Olivia alone.

I finally bought this on bluray a week ago and loved it just as I had every other time I had watched it.

Ive seen this movie about 3 times already its just so well written well done and genuinely creepy and suspenseful too boot.

The end leaves it up too interpretation as too what happens and I won't spoil it for those who have never seen this film.

Suffice it to say the killer is freaky the first time I heard his voice on that phone put a chill up my spine.

The acting was also top notch from Olivia Hussey Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin.

One of my favorite characters in this movie was the den mother hilarious and likeable at the same time.

That's another thing I loved about this film is that although its supposed too be terrifying and unsettling its also hilarious and has some really well done dark humor.

Highly recommended cant say that enough this a true classic horror movie and a perfect movie for the holidays for you horror lovers out there.

The movie also in closing does not have much violence which I also enjoyed .

1426726,5,B00005IC52,"For generations, the media has made movies about females being stalked, attacked, kidnapped, raped, or murdered by psychopathic men and Black Christmas manages to take all those and roll them into one to make this sadistic, dark horror Christmas tale.

Black Christmas focuses on a group of sorority sisters who are on the hit list of a psychotic man during the Christmas season. The movie opens with viewers getting a bit of a POV shot of this killer who climbs into the attic of the sorority house one night, while the sisters are throwing a party downstairs. Once inside, he makes creepy phone calls from inside the house (sorry Scream, it seems Black Christmas did it first), whispering degenerative things at the girls and playing what sounds like a recording of a woman being raped and killed.

The obnoxious would-be leader of the house, Barb provokes the caller by threatening to kill him before getting into a confrontation with sorority sister, Claire Harrison. Claire, feeling hurt and offended by what Barb said to her, strays from the party and goes to her room to pack her bags for a trip home for the Christmas holiday. However, in the midst of packing, she's attacked by the stalker who suffocates her to death with saran wrap. He then places her body in a rocking chair in the attic before making his escape.

When Claire's father arrives the the next day to pick Claire up but realizes she didn't show up to a scheduled timed meeting they made, he goes to the sorority house and from there goes to the police station with Barb and another sister, Phyllis, to file a missing person claim. As the police investigation widens, the body count gets higher and higher. With each phone call this mysterious demented creep makes, a new sorority sister will be slaughtered. They won't know when, they won't know where, and no one will see it coming.

Overall: What a movie! The 70s was arguably the greatest generation for horror movies to be made and Black Christmas is one of the reasons why. The plot is just creepy. Put yourself in the shoes of these characters and imagine it happening to you. There's nothing creepier than a psychotic killer on the loose in town who's just so happened to stumble into your house and kill of the residents of it one at a time. Of course many horror fans may consider Scream to be the first horror movie to feature a movie about a killer who hides in the homes of their soon to be victims and makes creepy phone calls to them within the house--or at least the first to truly expand on the plot. But really, Black Christmas was probably the first. I don't find this movie scary but it is creepy. Watch it in the dark and alone with the volume turned up and there's a possibility you may get scared. Everything about Black Christmas makes it a gem; and possibly an underrated one at that. Make this film the next one to add to your horror collection",1419465600,2,2894,4.581081081081081
1426727,5,B00005IC52,"LOVED it! nice and slow and oozing with atmosphere, black christmas captures the christmas spirit, and then asphyxiates the life out of it. it's especially groovy to see, when stood next bob clark's other yuletide classic, a christmas story, how in command of december mood establishing clark is. olivia hussey was great as the final girl, more than up to the challenge, and not the same easy mark as her sorority sisters. margot kidder was also a lot of fun as sad drunkard barb, and it was a hoot seeing john saxon as a more reactive police officer; donald thompson could have taken some tips on the right way to be cop (i mean, other than failing to search the house or not really wondering why the first vic disappeared with a half-packed suitcase on her bed) from saxon's lt. fuller.

bob clark just makes an absolutely beautiful movie, and the use throughout the house of dark browns and oak paneling, combined with the tudor architecture, really makes it feel christmas-y. The low-lit hallways and bedrooms add to the movies creep factor, which goes through the roof with each creaking floorboard. throw in the loud and unpleasant crank calls and some tense moments of procedural work over at the telephone company, and black christmas totally jingle bell rocks.",1419206400,2,1269,4.821100917431193

A lot of people would recognize the lead actors and actresses in this movie, some were already well known and some later to be. I particularly have always loved Olivia Hussey, one of the most beautiful actresses of all time. She has sure been in a strange mix of movies in her career, like this one. Later she was Mary in Jesus of Nazareth. She has the largest role, followed by girls like Margot Kidder, who is outrageous in this movie. In addition to being a well written horror thriller, there is comedy in this movie. They knew how to do this appropriately back then, a lost art today, as is most movie making today. Some of the dialogue in the first half of this movie is hilarious, as well as some of the posters we see on the walls of the rooms in the girls dorm. A true thriller classic. Glad there's a blu-ray with lots of extras on it now.",1419120000,2,1156,4.235294117647059
1426739,5,B00005IC52,"I've got to say, the only way I found out about this movie is through its 2006 remake. To be honest, if it weren't for the remake, I probably would never have heard about this movie until it would be too late. So there IS a bright side to remakes: They lead these new generations to the original movies, and they'll figure out to appreciate those movies even more. The same thing happen to me on Star Trek when I've seen the 2009 reboot.

So to put simply, I'm really happy to buy this movie from Amazon. They're the best website to ever go to. I give them 15 stars out of 10. But anyway, this movie's edition's picture and audio quality is really good, it helps for my flat-screen TV. It was truly a shock to me when I found out that the man who directed this movie, Bob Clark, was the same guy who directed the 1983 legendary/classic holiday comedy 'A Christmas Story' (or 'Shoot Your Eye Out', as me and my Pops would call it). It's ironic. But to say, this movie is a really scary, and well thought-out whodunit slasher-thriller. I love how we are NEVER told or shown the killer's true identity, he's just Billy and he's psycho, that's it; and it's perfect that way. ;)  I also love how it's a bit of a murder mystery, with one of the sorority girls being killed off in the first several minutes of the movie, and the rest of the film follows her friends, her father, and the police attempting to investigate her sudden ""disappearance"".

That whole ""Fellatio 20880"" joke; When I first watched that whole joke, I honestly did not know what fellatio meant (I was as dumbfounded as that cop Sgt. Nash), until I read about; (LMAO :D) It's just hilarious; Nash is in way over his head not knowing what fellatio meant.

But on an end-note, this movie is really great, still a timeless classic. It's perfect to watch this and 'Halloween' back-to-back together on one late night, or Halloween, or Christmas Eve. I think it deserves to be released on video by either The Criterion Collection or Shout! Factory; they would do the movie justice. But, please check out this movie, you won't be disappointed.

It all begins as a little joke until the phone calls becomes worse and one of the girls by the name of Clare Harrison(Lynne Griffin) disappears.-summary

Recognized as the father of the slasher genre for breaking new ground. Black Christmas(1974) directed by Bob Clark is hailed as a horror/slasher masterpiece. It actually laid out the blueprint to produce a superb slasher utilizing its atmosphere to instill fear in the viewer. One can easily detect the fingerprints of Black Christmas all over classics such as John Carpenter's Halloween(1978) and When a Stranger Calls(1979) directed by Fred Walton. However, I'm not here to judge this film on its influence but as a horror film. In my view, the film still holds up and provides a breath of fresh air for the sophisticated horror fan in the process, whom has binged on too many mediocre slashers as of late.

For the record, although they can be very redundant, slashers are my favorite of the horror genre and once in a while something will standout. They're not my favorite because I like to see brutal killings. When done right and from a realistic perspective, an excellent slasher can leave a lasting impression. Like it or not, serial killers are real and they are among us, and I feel Black Christmas is another one of those films that shows us what a truly mentally disturbed person is capable of.

Black Christmas is truly one of the greats and this style of horror is rare these days. Today, many horror film directors seek to instill fear by shocking the audience. They carry out this style of thoughtless horror, by adding very large body counts through death in the most disturbing, and sometimes in the clumsiest of ways. For a perfect example, see Black Christmas(2006) directed by Glen Morgan. This style of horror can be entertaining to a certain degree, but for me and many others it lacks soul. When watching a horror film, I want to experience fear in its true form through suspense, atmosphere, and tense build up. For the most part, I need to see pure horror that can stimulate my imagination. This is one of the few that grants my wish.

The direction is very good. Bob Clark indeed had a vision, and that vision was to give the viewer a close up on madness. The killer who enters the house is everything a madman would be. He's completely irrational, mentally he's on another planet, but above all else he is dangerous. I have never been a victim of prank calls, but I can only imagine the feeling of a person being delivered lines from someone who sounds completely disturbed.

The superb camera work is pretty much the backbone of the film. The viewer is watching some of the events through the eyes of the killer. This is what triggers the fear in the film. The girls are in the house carrying on with their forms of entertainment, while the killer is only on one floor above them watching. He moves through the house quietly and at will. The killer who goes by the name of ""Billy"" only continues to become more of a terrifying character. The eerie music score which is used at the right times receives credit for this as well. It helps in a great deal to build the tension and suspense.

Where I feel the horror works its edge with the viewer, is through the fear of the unknown. While watching the film, we all know the girls of the sorority house are in danger. However, they have no clue of the immediate danger which is literally above them. This film can definitely give a paranoid person whom lives alone something to think about. The film has solid acting, which is most notable by Jess(Olivia Hussey) and Barb(Margot Kidder). The characters have realistic and diverse personalities. Those who get a good amount of screen time are pretty well developed.

Although this is a very good film it does have flaws. The film is slow which isn't really a bad thing, but there's too many scenes that really don't go anywhere. Especially, the scenes involving the sorority house mother. They add a bit of comedy, but I really didn't need to be reminded of her habit. Valuable screen time was wasted when it could have been used on making the death scenes more detailed. The kills are somewhat disturbing but they won't satisfy the gore hounds.

Black Christmas has a lot going for it but I do believe it's an acquired taste. This film more than likely will not appeal to those who enjoy their horror fast paced, explanations for everything, or containing bucket loads of gore. I would love to give more detail but huge spoilers would be hard to avoid and I refuse to go that route.

I'm not going to say ""true"" horror fans are the only ones who will appreciate this. I can't define a ""true"" horror fan; people just have different taste and I can understand anyone who comes away from this wondering what all the fuss was about. If you're the type that appreciates a horror film that works through building tension, suspense, atmosphere, and is thought provoking. Then I recommend this to you.

Pros: Realistic, atmospheric, great tension build up, suspense

Cons: Slow paced for some, may not appeal to""shock"" and ""dark comedy"" audience, unnecessary scenes",1412553600,3,5386,4.6768743400211195

This is one of the most frightening horror films ever made. The killer's POV shots cause a strongly intensifies the scenes as we see him stalk the girls. Not only is that scary but those phone calls are destined to make your skin crawl. They consist of screaming child-like voices, an upset mother, a harrowing laughter- scared, huh?

The kills are also very good and one is rather unique. While it doesn't focus on the gore, there are scenes that are violent in nature.

The acting in this is superb! The lead actress Olivia Hussey(Romeo and Juliet) does an amazing job as the more caring of the sisters. However the one that stands out is Margrot Kidder's(The Amityville Horror and SuperMan 1&2) as the hilarious alcoholic Barb. Her performance is excellent and one of her best scenes involves a hilarious ""fact"" about turtles.

The police in this film are actually not that stupid. Most horror films have IDIOTIC police officers however a part from the ending and one officer, they were rather good.

One of the most effective and underrated horror films EVER, Black Christmas is destined to have your skin tear out of your body and walk away in fear. 10/10",1404172800,,1324,4.7894736842105265

After the others slowly get killed all in different unique was. And every time the killer goes back in the attic with no one noticing.

The movie has some witty dialogue at times so it isn't always serous. So that keeps the movie from getting stale, you actually care for the characters because of that.

It stars Margot Kidder who I remember from SUPERMAN; there is Olivia Hussey who I saw in ROMEO AND JULIET and JESUS OF NAZARETH; and I noticed the policeman at the desk was a laughing coach in another Bob Clark movie, PORKYS;  and I even noticed a guy in this movie who sold Christmas trees in A CHRISTMAS STORY . . . The one who tells Ralphie's mother ""no, that's them balsams"" when she asks, ""this isn't one of those trees where all the needles fall off?""  You know the guy.  Well, he has a part in this film too.

It was similar to HALLOWEEN in suspense and the story reminds me of that movie.  Same horror, different holiday.  I'm surprised I didn't hear more about it or see it as often as they show HALLOWEEN on TV.  No special effects, the terror is mostly derived from your own imagination.

In fact, until the remake came along in 2006, Id never heard anyone mention this.  Yes, it is a cult classic of the genre and actually has some devoted fans, but they are quieter and usually overtaken by fans of more populous choices.

Black Christmas, for as abrasive in nature the cover may seem, is actually a pretty subdued horror film.

The killings, for the most part, appear off screen (or obscured in some way) and most of the action is centered on uncovering the whereabouts of a missing person and not so much dealing with the actual killer himself.  The scariest moments center around a phone and so this can damped some of the actual thrills, even if it manages to be thrilling.  The bottom line for me though is that Black Christmas just isn't all that memorable.  Besides a deliciously evil score, the film just fails to make much of an impact, and the finale, while unnerving to a degree, is ultimately lost on a film that failed to make much of that build up.  It comes off slightly redundant in parts, regurgitating the same scenario and never really taking us where we need to go.  The acting is also very shaky, and the film becomes so preoccupied with a sub-plot concerning a pregnancy that it derails the actual film, even if it thinks its building a case for a killer (which it isn't and never really feels like it is).

The film just feels flat for the most part, and about as un-horror like as a horror film can get.",1389052800,2,1663,4.458745874587459

Historical significance notwithstanding, even as a template for future slasher flicks, it is at most just an interesting exercise in mood enhancement (thanks in large part to a fabulous score).  The pace is deliberate (some might say slow).  The murders are oddly restrained and few in number (for the most part just implied).  The scariest thing about this film is the phone calls.  The cast, for the most part, serves the story well (with the obvious exception of a strangely flat performance by Olivia Hussey).  The best of the lot are Marian Waldman as the slightly daffy sorority housemother with booze hidden everywhere and Margot Kidder as Barb.  The shortcomings involve an unsatisfying non-ending and a killer who's never seen, never identified.

It's the total opposite of White Christmas.  This movie should have been called Halloween Hell.  Sometimes I wonder what goes through the minds of these screenwriters.

The movie begins with the camera focusing on the five-pointed stars on the building and on the building number which is 6. Put the 2 stars and the number together and what do you get?  The movie also gave screen time to drunkenness, sexual graphics and expressions.  The sicko in the film speaks in different nerve-racking voices; so, you also have possession in this freak flick.

Another thing you may want to know is that there is an underlying theme: abortion.  This film was released in 1974, a year after abortion was legalized.  It focuses on the right of the woman to have an abortion regardless of what the man thinks, wants or what is right.  And in very deadly terms it states that if you're against abortion you deserve to die.

These are all unsettling and purposely crafted messages within an inhuman movie.  It's not to be watched during the Christmas season especially with loved ones and family.  In fact, if you can avoid it, it's not to be watched at all; but, if you're disposed to watch it, not without a high degree of perturbation, nausea and an inclination to jettison the entire contents of your stomach and intestines.

1426828,5,B00005IC52,"The girls of the Pi Kappa Sigma sorority are receiving threatening phone calls on Christmas Eve, but little do they know that they are coming from a killer that is hiding inside the house! Unappreciated in its time and still surprisingly unseen by many, BLACK CHRISTMAS nevertheless remains one of the most influential films in the pre-Slasher cycle, and an unsung classic of modern Horror. Calls coming from within the house, a faceless, motiveless killer, an auspicious holiday setting, a house filled with terrified co-eds, the chilling first-person perspective of the killer. Many of these defining characteristics first appeared in BLACK CHRISTMAS, a full four years before John Carpenter would release HALLOWEEN.

BLACK CHRISTMAS introduces us to an excellent cast of characters who, though conventional, show a great deal of personal identity. We have Margot Kidder who plays an all-too-convincing drunken bitch, a bumbling and smart-mouthed house mother Mrs. Mack, the beautiful Olivia Hussey in the lead, and film legend John Saxon as the cunning police chief who is out to stop the killer. The actors help to balance the even blend of dark humor and horror that Bob Clark has written in to each of their lines. No character is ever 'offed' in any simple manner; each of their deaths are as violent as they are unique and memorable. Clare's asphyxiation atop the rocking chair holds the same impact and horror as Argento's opening strangulation in SUSPIRIA.

Bob Clark instills a constant sense of dread despite the cheerful holiday setting. The old, dark house provides an ominous setting for his characters to roam, as the camera effortlessly floats through its hallways with all of the style and grace of the great Mario Bava. The suspense never ends in BLACK CHRISTMAS, and neither does the mystery. The audience is left guessing as to the identity of the killer all the way to the very end. There is no safety or solace to be found in the closing scene; in fact, the night has just begun for poor Jess! Though many are killed throughout the film, very little is actually shown. Instead, Clark tastefully alludes to the extreme acts of violence off-camera. This would be reversed in the 2006 remake. Utterly.

Before his tragic death in 2007, Bob Clark revealed that an ambitious film student once asked him what he would do if he were to ever make a sequel to BLACK CHRISTMAS. Clark stated that he would set it one year later in the same house. The killer was caught, but has escaped from the mental institute to resume killing. He would call it HALLOWEEN. Who else would ask but a young John Carpenter, the known opportunist who would go on to make the similarly titled (and themed) Horror classic. Whether Carpenter truly stole his ideas from here or not is largely irrelevant at this point, but BLACK CHRISTMAS deserves rightful recognition for establishing many key elements of the Slasher genre that are commonly ascribed to HALLOWEEN. It is a wonderfully dark and brooding film that should be at the top of every Horror fan's list!

The killer is very well played. This film is deservedly cult horror classic status material. To me, the remake isn't bad either-though it has been awhile since I've watched it. This one seems to have a much more ominious feeling of dread and terror though, if you haven't seen it and you're a slasher/horror film fan, you may want to check it out.

1426840,5,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas tells the story of a psychotic serial killer stalking and disturbing a group of college students at a sorority house. Black Christmas is a creepy, unsettling, and atmospheric slasher.

The story in this film is creepy, although recognizable; if you're familiar with urban legends, you'll probably be able to guess some of the twists and scenes in this movie; I won't go into detail, so I can avoid spoilers. My favorite scenes in this film involved the creepy and unsettling phone calls; these phone calls are extremely disturbing because of how well-done they are. The wicked, unforgettable voice was truly chilling. This film also effectively uses suspense, especially in the scenes where our disturbed killer is stalking. There is a scene that does follow the same horror formula that some people get mad at; a main character is told to do something by the police (logical), she does the opposite (illogical). This scene didn't really hurt the film because it leads to a suspenseful ending and an amazing ""eye"" scene, that I won't spoil any further. It also has some humorous scenes that actually work. The film moves at a fast pace, and had great acting and music.

I own the Blu-Ray of this film. The picture and sound quality has definitely been updated from previous versions, so you will see a difference. However, it's not the best upgrade, so don't expect something like the ""Blade Runner"" release. It does have some special features like trailers and a few interviews.

Overall, Black Christmas is an exceptional slasher; it has has the suspense and brutality you'd expect in a slasher, and has extremely disturbed villain. I highly recommend a purchase.

Black Christmas has strong violence and blood, no sex or nudity.",1357603200,,1747,4.972602739726027
1426841,2,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas is a 1974 slasher film (widely regarded as the first slasher film). You may never have heard of this neglected horror film, and if so it is definitely worth a watch. This film was the first to take the stalker dynamic and update it for modern audiences. Many horror films such as Friday the 13th borrowed elements from this.

While it is heralded for being the first slasher flick, the film suffers from pacing issues. Pacing in horror films is often slower to build suspense, but this film is particularly long-winded. The plot is simple enough, a bloodthirsty psycho invades a sorority house in Canada and hides in the attic, systematically killing its residents one by one. Meanwhile a series of obscene phone calls plague the house as well. The police get involved and by the end of the film it is realized that the calls are coming from inside the house. Great concept, not so good execution. It simply takes too long for things to happen. Most of the murders are implied but there is one scene where Margot Kidder's character, Barbara, is stabbed multiple times with a sharp piece of crystal glass that is rather effective.

In the end, I prefer Halloween, but I regret not seeing this movie sooner as it belongs in any horror fan's collection.

1426860,5,B00005IC52,"Although its debatable what was truly the first ever slasher film (1960's ""Peeping Tom"" gave the perspective of the murderer, and 1963's ""Blood Feast"" had the gory serial killings), ""Black Christmas"" is certainly up there with the big daddies of early horror films that influenced generations and generations of horror movies. I guess there is no real ONE film that created or perfected the slasher genre, but ""Black Christmas"" is an entertaining and chilling claustrophobic film that helped set the stage for many films to follow.

One thing very interesting about the movie is how it works with so much minimalism. There is hardly a drop of blood throughout the movie, and (SPOILER!!!!) you don't find out who the killer is, but the way it combines the setting, atmosphere, acting and series of events so consistent makes it very watchable and enjoyable.

I thought it was excellent, mostly because it wasn't focused on a bunch of sex-crazed teens getting brutally murdered! Like Barb, for example, is hilarious!

1426863,4,B00005IC52,"Really, it can be.  Think about it.  People act really crazy around the holidays.  They camp outside of stores in the freezing cold hours before the store opens so they can buy the latest video game system.  When the doors open, they stampede inside and literally run to the product they want.  They fight with other customers over who gets the last remaining item in stock.  People get loaded around the holidays.  When that happens, look out.  Who knows what people are capable of once they get some drinks in them.  Road rage is rampant.  The kids are excited.  The relatives are coming over.  Cookies need to be baked.  The tree needs to go up and be trimmed.  The trees and shrubs outside need some Christmas lights.  The snow needs to be shoveled.  The gifts need to be purchased.  The gifts need to be wrapped.  The CD player needs some Christmas music.  Party trays need to be purchased along with ice cream, cake, beer, wine, etc.

So, calm down everybody.  Take it easy.  Unwind.  Sit down and watch a Christmas classic.  You know, Santa Claus Is Comi......wait, I mean, it's called Black Christmas.  Just when you thought you could escape from the stress of dealing with everything described above, I recommend this Christmas horror classic.  That's right - a HORROR movie.  If the above described things associated with Christmas stress you out and make you miserable, then you might as well prolong the misery.  Really, what's the difference?  You're already miserable, you might as well top it off with a scary Christmas movie.  Seriously though, I think watching horror movies during the holiday season actually helps deal with stress and helps one to escape for a few hours.  They work.  Sit in a dark room and be taken into another world for a few hours.  Watch Black Christmas, this original version from 1974.

This Canadian horror movie basically is about a sorority house in a college town that is terrorized by a psychotic killer who makes many obscene phone calls.  The suspense slowly builds as the movie progresses, but the movie is never boring.

This movie stars Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin, and John Saxon.  This movie was really the first modern slasher horror movie.  This movie has been influential to many horror movie makers, especially John Carpenter.  You'll see similarities between Halloween and Black Christmas.  The first-person point-of-view camera technique is the main thing you'll notice.  Also, what is it with these two movies?  The phone rings off the hook!

The movie is 98 minutes long.  The extras on the DVD are good, which include The 12 Days of Black Christmas, a documentary on the making of the movie, including interviews.  There are also interviews with Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder.  Also included is Midnight Screening Q & A session and two newly discovered original scenes.

1426864,5,B00005IC52,"It's Christmas time, and the sorority sisters of an unnamed college (re: filmed in Canada) are partying before they return home for the holidays.  Meanwhile, an unseen lunatic/psycho/madman enters the house to do bad things.  As the police investigate a missing girl in town, they learn about the obscene phone calls being made to the sorority house and try tracing them...

Black Christmas is sometimes credited as ""the first slasher movie"", but let's put it up there with Bava's earlier Twitch of the Death Nerve, say they both ""created"" or popularized the genre, and call it a day.  These days, having been through literally decades of ""slasher"" movies, and then Saw, and all manner of onscreen nastiness, Black Christmas a) should be viewed in context and appreciated for its time and ::gasp:: originality, and b) is still creepy and demented enough for today's fans to enjoy.

The film also created or least popularized some of the most dependable elements (now clichs) of horror movies:

 - ""College"" students played by people well out of college (including Keir Dullea / Bizarro Joe Montana)
 - Unspeakable horror during a holiday
 - The killer's point of view shot / heavy breathing
 - The obscene, creepy phone calls
 - The phone calls coming from within the house(!)
 - The killer sometimes ""hiding"" in plain sight (because the cast is blind)
 - The cops as complete idiots

Using the ""less is more"" approach, Black Christmas eschews gore for suspense and just general creepiness.  There's some blood, but nothing like its successors.  Director Bob Clark has a nice touch when, during a scene where a town search party looks for a lost girl, they come upon what we can only assume is her dead body...but it's never shown, and we hear only the barking of the hounds.  The restraint is old-fashioned compared to today.  Clark fought to keep the gore minimal and the ending ambiguous when---surprise!---the studio wanted more explicit material.  John Carpenter cites it as a big influence on Halloween (often credited for being the first slasher), and rumor has it that Halloween actually came out of early ideas for a Black Christmas sequel.  (Halloween is great on its own, and there never was a Black Christmas sequel.)

The film holds up well, though some weaned on not-scary gore zone freak shows may not get as excited.  Horror fans will appreciate a horror movie that lets the audience's (depraved) imagination fill in the blanks.  Remade in 2006, when---surprise!---the gore was far more explicit, and they went through the trouble of thoroughly explaining the killer and his motivations.

The film looks great on DVD, and I'm sure it's even sharper on BluRay, though there must be limitations to how sharp it can appear given the source material and age.  Fans will love the photography, how the cheerily decorated sorority house takes on a creepy feeling, how the Christmas lights start to look...eerie.  The extras include making-of and behind-the-scenes material, very welcome for this cult flick.  Oddly, no trailers?

Highly recommended on DVD or BluRay, it's still seems like an underrated classic, and definitely a keeper.  Not recommended to those who have a problem with horror movies set during Christmas.",1296864000,4,3231,5.0206766917293235
1426865,5,B00005IC52,"When I first purchased ""Black Christmas"", I did not immediately watch it.  I was intrigued from reviews and have been a consistent fan of the horror genre.  When I first watched it, it seemed slow.  I did not pay much attention and wrote it off as an ""alright"" DVD.  I was very wrong.  When I watched it a second time one winter night in December, I was scared out of my wits.  If you've watched this movie and found it slow-moving, WATCH IT AGAIN.  It is truly a gem.

The opening scene depicts a Tudor-style sorority house blanketed in snow and Christmas lights.  ""Silent Night, Holy Night"" is playing in the background and you see the main character Jess (played by Olivia Hussey from 1968's 'Romeo & Juliet' fame) entering the front door of the house.  The camera pans above the front door to see that it is framed by the old, Charlie Brown-type multi-colored Christmas lights (the film was made in 1974 afterall) and we see the bustle inside as the camera moves from window to window, decorated with red, blue, & green stars.  Everyone in the sorority house is getting ready for the Christmas recess and it is busy with the girls preparing to leave.  We also see an ""unknown"" stranger from his POV (ripped off by John Carpenter for 'Halloween') climb an outside trellis attached to the house and enter an attic window.

The suspense of the movie slowly builds with the periodic prank calls from a stranger that the girls nickname ""The Moaner"".  The calls are juvenile, obsene, and profanity-laced with the caller coming off as disturbingly insane.  One-by-one girls start to go missing and we see them being murdered by the unseen stranger in the attic.  When ""good girl"" Claire (played by Lynne Griffin who also has another small, memorable role in 'The Amateur') is suffocated in plastic wrap, the viewer finds themselves in rapt attention.  Each time the phone rings, your heart quickens.

Throughout the film, the characters are defined and interlaced with the suspense.  Olivia Hussey's Jess comes across as a quiet, kind girl that seems to maintain great composure and control in the face of a terrifying situation.  A young Margot Kidder (pre-'Superman') is the wise-cracking party girl Barb and Andrea Martin (SCTV fame) is the nerdy sweet Phyl.  Mrs. Mac adds humor as the closet drunk housemother, but does come off as a bit annoying and lacking credibility as a housemother.  John Saxon is wonderful as the police officer assigned to the case and Keir Dullea does a fine turn as Jess' eccentric pianist boyfriend.

""Black Christmas"" will quickly become a viewing Christmas tradition that will put a twist in your holiday season.  As the tagline says ""And all through the house a creature was stirring....""  INDEED.",1293408000,3,2730,4.8068669527897
1426866,5,B00005IC52,"At Christmas time I like to watch White Christmas and I like to watch Black Christmas.  Actors Andrea Martin, Olivia Hussey, and Margot Kidder really do interact like a trio of sorority sisters and, when Hussey ignores the policeman on the phone and begins to mount the stairs towards the end of the picture, for once you don't start shouting at her, you understand why she would be reluctant to walk out of a house without her two friends.  (Irony!)  I don't know how much they paid Olivia Hussey to make this film, and from what Bob Clark said she only did it on the advice of a psychic, but they didn't pay her enough--she is far from the greatest actress in the world, but she really holds the movie together.  Her quiet strength and her compassion give the movie more warmth than its alhebraic plot (one character disappears every 10 minutes) actually has room for.  I always love the scene when carolers come and sing ""Adeste Fidelis,"" and Olivia Hussey looks entranced throughout the whole thing, and then, even in the middle of the panic about the murders, she remembers to run out to the kids and give the female coach some money (as a tip?)--now, that's classy!

She looks genuinely moved at the music.  I relate this to the fact that Olivia Hussey also was later to play the Virgin Mary in the Zeffirelli version of Jesus of Nazareth.  Altogether she has had a much more varied screen career than her detractors would have one believe.  She has to do a lot of heavy lifting, as it were, to make her scenes with Peter work.  They just don't seem like they were ever a good couple, she's annoyed with him from the get go and he's a mess, although he gets to wear a splendid green, yellow, gray, black and brown houndstooth jacket when he gives his all-important piano recital.  Keir Dullea is of course a legendary presence in the 60s and 70s cinema, and every time he comes onscreen he brings with him the rags and tatters of all his famous roles.  Did you know he could really play the piano, and was a favorite student of Glenn Gould's (the two spent the off hours of Black Christmas hanging out in Toronto and attempting to rehearse Peter's shattering solo) and that the jacket in question was actually borrowed from Gould as a good luck charm?  Well, it worked.  Today listening to Peter's recital it is probably the most impressive segment of a really great score....  Keir Dullea grimaces when he hits a note by mistake...  or is that what his face is saying, because it sounds killer to me.

Until the collectors edition DVD I never really understood the disconnect between what Billy says on the phone and the expressions on the actresses' faces when they react.  He says the most vile things and they just stand there po-faced, and then when he says something innocuous they let him have it!  Well, apparently the actualy Billy dialogue was recorded later and during the time of filming, Hussey, Kidder and Martin were just listening to a silent phone and prompted to react at different moments of the clock.  Although I don't know how they worked this out during the infamous ""wart"" phone call that upsets our heroine so.  Maybe that was one time in which she actually knew what was being said on the other end of the conversation.

Is Black Christmas actually better than White Christmas?  Well, neither are high art type pictures, are they, but watched in rapid succession you might convince yourself that this really is the ""most wonderful time of the year.""",1293062400,,3481,4.597087378640777

Since there was a good hour and a half before kickoff on Sunday we figured why not participate in one more holiday review and get ourselves off the naught list by Spreading Joy (oh yeah oh yeah I think you will like it). As our second entry we decided to go with the cult classic 1974 legit horror Black Christmas. Despite it being legit it was still brimming with B, and the fact that it's a very overlooked horror film only adds a lot of allure for the Sid brothers.

The film takes place almost entirely in a sorority house that's plagued by some really creepy phone pranks. Now these aren't the harmless type Arnold or Hansen type soundboard pranks that everybody (except the Rubenator) just can't get enough of, these a full blown perved out pranks. IT sounded like short studd was on the other end of this phone telling these chicks to get down on the floor. However the calls are only the beginning of the trouble for this house on unshaven 70's foxes. Turns out this freakshow is hiding in their attic looking to pick them off one by one. Yeah that's some serious stuff right there.

On a serious not Black Christmas was a really creepy horror flick for the most part. Sure there were some lulls where you just wanted to speed things up a bit, but we get they're trying to build the suspense. It was probably the first movie to use the old ""the killer is calling from inside your house"" routine which probably blew peoples giant 70's mustaches off back then. It seems a bit morbid to watch a Christmas movie that's all about some freakshow serial killer, but we do it for the love of B. We know the old boy Santa won't think any less of us since viewing all genres of B is in our job description. So if you're looking for a break from the typical yule tide cheer then pop in Black Christmas and remember what we use to do to you.",1292716800,,2164,4.7071240105540895
1426868,5,B00005IC52,"The movie Halloween(1978) by John Carpenter is usually regarded as the grandaddy of all the slasher films. The reality is that Halloween borrowed a lot from this Canadian classic. Everyone look at the opening scenes of Black Christmas and compare them to Halloween. The camera is placed on the killer, we get the killer's pov. In Black Christmas we see the killer ""Billy"" climbing up the wall and finding his way into the sorority house. Much the same way that we see the killer's pov in the opening of Halloween. In fact the beginning AND ending of both films are almost EXACTLY the same. I've talked about the beginning, now the ending. In both movies the endings have open-ended endings where the killer is still around, still intact after the entire movie is over, alive to kill another day and in another movie.

Halloween went on to become a franchise but Black Christmas was for the most part forgotten. It has gotten more credit recently and there was even an unnecessary remake in 2006. But the original from 1974 remains one of the best horror movies ever made. This movie is great due to its plot, direction and cast. The cast includes a young Olivia Hussey and a young Margot Kidder as sorority sisters. The cast includes the rest of the sisters as well as some of their boyfriends and their hilarious sorority mom. The sorority mom, Mrs Mac(played by Marian Waldman), is a wonderful character. She is a foul-mouthed alcoholic mom who runs a pretty loose ship. But the sisters seem to love her anyway! The sorority girls have a lot in common with Mrs Mac especially Margot Kidder's character, Barb, Barb is also an obscene drunk. She goes to a police station and fools a dimwitted cop into writing a sexually explicit word into his report. Barb also gives alcohol to a little kid that the sisters have agreed to host for a Christmas party! Olivia Hussey's character is the straight-laced Jess, who has problems of her own. Jess is pregnant, her boyfriend is a wannabe concert pianist who seems a little un-hinged. For a while it looks like he is our killer ""Billy"".

Black Christmas does a great job of developing its killer Billy. Billy is deeply disturbed and he shows it by constantly calling the sorority house and making bizarre obscene calls. Billy is much more frightening than the slashers who came later like Michael Myers and Jason from Friday the 13th. Billy is very believable. There is nothing really supernatural about him. What's really scary about Billy is that he seems as smart as he is crazy! He brazenly kills women right in front of the cops' collective noses, yet they are helpless to stop him.

Black Christmas is the Grandaddy of All Slasher Films. It is a much scarier movie than all the slasher films that came after it too. It is a very creepy and atmospheric movie  that is good for multiple viewings. In fact you want to get a copy of this film in the format of your choice just as soon as you can.

Who knew that such an old movie would be refreshing?

  If you are a gore-hound..this is probably not for you. However, if you are interested in good acting and a good plot, then this is perfect! This movie does what a lot of horror films from today don't do; it actually tells a story and allows the viewer to get to know the characters..instead of the typical 4 high school or college student gore porn. There was no nudity..which would not be if this movie were made today (especially since it was in a sorority house). I appreciated that it felt like a real sorority house...like real college girls...not a bunch of porn stars bending over into the camera every two seconds...

  Another great thing about this movie is that you never see the killer! Maybe an eye here...or hands...or shadow..but never his face, which is even more terrifying because you don't know what you're dealing with...you have to use your imagination...The closing credits, to me, were so haunting..all you could hear was the ringing of the telephone..which, after this movie...will make your spine tingle!

But enough about that. The blu ray version vs. the dvd version. I purchased the blu ray version of black christmas because it was cheaper than the dvd version. Go figure, right? So the extras on the two versions are the same. So it comes down to picture quality. And that is where this movie falls short. Since it was shot in like 73 it was on old film. Not ever with the expectations of high definition. The problem is that the blu ray is so clear that it shows all the imperfections in the movie and you end up getting a slight grain on the screen. It really isn't a big deal, but I wasn't expecting much anyway because of how old it is. So the bottom line is which one is better.

The late Bob Clark's OTHER Christmas movie, 1974's ""Black Christmas"", has been credited for being the inspiration for films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, and the like, with its girl-stalking madman and ominous phone calls, but this one has an ending unlike those we usually see in such films.  It's the kind of ending you love or you hate, but very unique to be sure. The ensemble cast is fantastic, with Romeo and Juliet's Olivia Hussey as the star sorority girl, Keir Dullea as her troubled musician boyfriend, Margot Kidder as a sorority sister with a wild streak, Andrea Martin as another sister of the row, and John Saxon as determined Lt. Fuller. I wouldn't call ""Black Christmas"" a gory film, but it's still got some really disturbing deaths in it. The plot is clearly not very complicated, but the details given to the events can certainly make it seem more intense. Over all, a very satisfying film if you are able to like the unexpected ending, and much better than the recent remake, which I can't even remember anymore, despite having some of my favorite girls in the cast.

This Blu-Ray release for ""Black Christmas"" has been panned quite a bit already. There are no commentaries and the audio for the surround sound is said to be out of synch (not sure since I watched it in mono). Plus, there are complaints about a grainy picture, but for a film like this, that's to be expected. Over all, it looks good and there are still some nice extras, despite not having a commentary. Both an English and a French trailer for the film are included, as well as a nice, short featurette and a post rerelease Q&A session. Also included are found clips with alternate audio (2 of them) and interviews with three of the film's stars, Hussey, Kidder, and Art Hindle (who played boyfriend to one of the sorority sisters). If you're a fan of this film, the Blu-Ray is still well worth getting, and if you've never seen it, be sure to check it out for a genuinely creepy killer and a very different holiday viewing experience!",1263081600,2,2360,4.709443099273607
1426888,4,B00005IC52,"This is the classic 'black christmas""  the new version just couldn't hold a candle to this one at all.  This one had the excellent talents of director Bob Clark (rip), actresses Margot Kidder, Olivia  hussy, andrea martin , excellent acting from john saxon, art hindle and the rest of the supporting cast too.  It has a eerie movie that still shines all these years later and it's was highly influential to what would come later.  It's not as gory as movies that in five years time would be unleashed on the world; but it's still atmospheric and creepy as hell.  This isn't a superfast moving slasher flick , it has strong character buildup and is not a body county movie either. Those types of movies are fine though.  The transfer needed some work but I had no synch problems at all. The vocals matched completely and are not a problem.  The films natural grain is really brought forth and the print needed some color restoration work particularily on black scenes.  Still there are no lines, cuts or specks.  But in comparison to many horror movies from that era that look spiced and diced this print is very decent.  Some grain and off coloring is nothing in comparison to the hideously destroyed prints that many dvd's have of movies released from the seventies.  All in all I would recommend this blu ray version if you accept that the hd process is going to bring out the grain really highly. It does this on any movie though; even 24 season 7 in dark scenes on blu ray the grainy film effect is amplified.  However I am glad I got to see this classic horror movie on blu.  That being said they STILL need to remaster this one and lower the grain in some scenes.  ( I doubt this will ever be done though whcih is a shame, they could color restore it too) ANd the director of this was killed in a car accident so that doesn't help either in that regard.",1262476800,,1859,4.426470588235294

The story starts out very promising and gives us a very eerie setting. The acting is above average, but there are numerous scenes of silly chatter that slow the film down. The film really gets going towards the end, but some plot holes kept me from being totally immersed in the horror. One in particular, how did Peter know Jess was in the basement?...and why did he break the window for that matter. I know why the director had this happen, but it makes no sense at all. That aside, the film does have a creepy quality and the ending is particularly chilling. I recorded this off of an HD channel, so I'm not sure how the DVD transfer is or anything about the new release. It is a well made chiller, but hardly the best horror film ever made in my eyes. I give it props for being an early film of this nature, but the script could have used a little tweaking.",1257206400,,977,4.229946524064171

The grain is worse than my old DVD.  I looks like it was filmed through a silk screen.  To make matters ever worse, the audio is not synced.  Impossible to watch.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

I was asked to upgrade my rating for this film and I agree............. in tribute to my belief that this is one of the best crafted horror movies I have ever seen.  Just be aware that I still believe that the Blu Ray is not a upgrade from the original DVD.  I have both and it is NOT better from the fans aspect IMHO.

1426904,4,B00005IC52,"There is a reason why Black Christmas has lasted so long.  It predates Halloween and Friday the 13th by several years as it is an early inspiration for the later rise of  ""slasher"" films.  It uses innovative camera tricks and gives us the killer's POV.  And it takes the sacred holiday of Christmas and interjects it with real-life morality conflicts of its characters.

The transfer on this edition is decent, and is coupled with some great features.  A 20-minute candid interview with Margot Kidder stands out.  Also, a documentary featuring remembrances from the cast and crew is quite informative.  Top it off with a new 5.1 mix, and you have a nice blu-ray bundle.  Great to add to your collection!",1244505600,4,703,4.791666666666667
1426905,4,B00005IC52,"Many people think that Halloween was the first slasher movie, but Black Christmas was made four years earlier and is the first proper slasher movie that was made. There were a few gore movies in the sixties which featured death scenes throughout and of course ""Psycho"" and ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"" was made in 1972, but none of these movies properly followed the slasher movie forumla untill Black Christmas. So I think that this movie deserves credit for being (arguably) the first one of its kind out there.

A bunch of girls (aged somewhere between 18 and 22) in a college sorority house receive series of prank phone calls, which aren't so much threatening as disturbing and then start getting killed off. These phone calls are the scariest part of the movie, in my opinion, the are REALLY creepy and disturbing. The movie relies on suspence and its creepiness rather than violence and the deaths (of which there are only a few) have almost no gore. Another element which adds to the suspence of the movie is that we know from very early on in the movie that the killer was in the house with the girls so one of them could be killed at any time.

The Good things about the movie are that the phone calls are genuinely creepy and there is quite a lot of suspence throughout, and it was the first movie of its kind.

The Bad things are that therent aren't many death scenes or much gore in the movie and also, even before the girls start to dissappear, all of the charactors seem to be clinically depressed, in a few scenes the main protagonist, Jess, looks as though she may burst into tears (although to be fair we later find out that she is planning on having an abortion) which made me feel sorry for them. The end is rather confusing too - it might just be me thing thick but after finishing the movie Im still not really sure who the killer was.

Overall quite a good slasher which I would reccomend viewing because of its at-the-time origionality and because its very creepy and suspenceful. Deffinately worth a watch.",1237593600,,2030,4.523160762942779
1426906,4,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas has always sat on my list of must-see movies. Granted, I saw the remake when it originally came out, and that peaked my interest just a bit, yet I still never got around to it. It wasn't until a friend of mine whose critical mind I respect told me to finally sit and watch it that I did just that.

 I was pleasantly surprised. It is the total and complete opposite of it's remake. There is no outlandish gore, no silly incoherent back story, no ... well, the only thing to two have in common are the title, the setting, and some character names.

 Most know the story; a sorority house is constantly plagued with sexually crazed & threatening phone calls from ""Billy."" Not thinking much about them, they go on about their daily routines. It's not until a few sisters begin disappearing that they take note of what's going on.

 It was stated in the films extras and in many reviews of the film that classic slashes such as Halloween & When A Stranger Calls took many vices from this film. Black Christmas is the start-all of the slasher genre. I'd say that it a respectful title for the film.

 I was actually surprised that there were a few moments when I jumped at a scare or two (possibly three), and that some of Billy's phone antics actually gave me chills. It's been a while that movie has been able to do that. It's silly to think that Bob Clark, director, went on to be the one to direct Baby Geniuses 2. He handled all aspects of his film with grace, and showed what a true horror film should be right up until the ominous ending. And thankfully, writer Roy Moore didn't give us a motive as to Billy's doings. Billy was just a figure whose identity is never given nor shown (making him an even creepier substance) and whose motives are never thrown into our face. He's just there, and one had hope he isn't.

 The performances here aren't Grade A performances, but they worked. Olivia Hussey is a beauty. She's about as real as one can get (Laurie Strode competitor? Possibly). Her ""Hello""s did nerve me a bit. She got so demanding when she answers the phone, even if she doesn't know if it's Billy. Margot Kidder is amazing, and the lines she had are classic. Marian Waldman (rest in peace) - Mrs. Mac - is just as classic. The alone moments with Ms. Mac had me loving the lady each time. And seeing John Saxon in a police jackets gets me every time. The rest of the cast (oh, Andrea Martin, I love you and your slight fro') deliver exactly what needed to be delivered.

 It sort of saddens me that I'm having to compare the original to the remake as opposed to having to compare the remake to the original, but I believe it has made me appreciate the original so much more.",1235865600,,2701,4.38

The storyline was kind of slow and not very exciting, the acting was really bad at times and the film wasn't restored as good as I could have expected after seeing the restoration jobs on films like Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don't like how you never really discover much about the killer, it doesn't make it scarier, just more boring. This film however, had some real gem moments. Sme of the killings and some scenes are pretty groundbreaking. There is suspense and all in all it's a cult classic. I just think it's slightly overrated. It is a solid film though, and every horror fan needs to see this to check out how this paved the directional way of later films in the genre.",1235865600,3,845,4.3544303797468356

1426909,3,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas is a fun, old slasher pic. One that eschews most of the slasher film formulas for the better (not surprising since this was done before there was a 'slasher film' genre). The characters behave realisticly and they respond to threats in ways that won't make you angry.

The movie has a nicely creepy opening and a terrific half hour of an ending. The problem is that there's forty minutes or so in the middle that is sorta draggy. It isn't wasted time or anything, but maybe shoul have been paced better.

Still, 'Billy' is genuinely scary. The obscene calls will make your flesh crawl and that 'eye behind the door' shot really haunts me. Easily worth watching (and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-remake/dp/B000MM0LIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the remake</a>&nbsp;isn't as bad as you've heard either).",1230508800,4,866,5.653846153846154
1426910,5,B00005IC52,"""Black Christmas"" is an original, innovative holiday slasher flick that influenced countless imitations, including John Carpenter and Debra Hill's highly successful ""Halloween.""  Directed by the versatile Bob Clark (director of the zombie horror hit ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" as well as the heartwarming family comedy ""A Christmas Story""), ""Black Christmas"" is a  Canadian horror gem that has its own cult following and a website:  ItsMeBilly.com.  Though it never spawned a sequel, a successful remake was released in 2006.

  The plot is chilling, suspenseful, and realistic.  A few days before Christmas, an unknown psychopath sneaks into the attic of a sorority house.  He makes obscene phone calls that terrify the residents.  One girl (Claire Harrison played by Lynne Griffin of ""Curtains"") is suffocated with a dry cleaning bag and her corpse seated in a rocking chair in the attic.  She remains there throughout the storyline, unknown to those below.

  The viewer never sees the killer's face.  All we learn about him is that his name is Billy and he had a sister named Agnes.  He may have killed her.  Before killing a victim, he refers to her as ""Agnes.""

  The cast is great.  John Saxon (""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") is Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller who is investigating Claire's disappearance.  Olivia Hussey (""Psycho IV"") is the pregnant heroine, Jessica Bradford, who is terrorized by her angry boyfriend, Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea).  Seventies scream queen Margot Kidder (""Sisters"" and ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"") is the depressed alcoholic student, Barb Coard.  Art Hindle (of David Cronenberg`s ""The Brood"") is Claire's worried boyfriend, Chris Hayden.  Andrea Martin (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") is the only actor to star in the 2006 remake.  Playing a student, Phyllis Carlson, in the original, Martin returns in the remake as the sorority housemother.

  ""Black Christmas"" is a creepy, atmospheric horror slasher with a downbeat, open ending; it reminded me of the ending in ""The House on Sorority Row.""  ""Black Christmas"" is a must see for fans of holiday slasher fare and slasher flicks in general.  It is definitely a holiday horror classic.  Watch it back to back with the remake for an interesting perspective on how horror films have evolved over the past thirty years.

I like Black Christmas for the most part because you never get to see the killer; you only hear his creepy, crackling, high pitched screams on the other end of the telephone.

The transfer and sound are great. There are still some traces of foreign matter visible from the print used, but this is the nicest copy you'll probably ever see on a home edition. I believe it is the same transfer used for the Special Edition in 2006.

The features are identical to the Special Edition release:
- 12 Days of Black Christmas featurette
- Midniht Q&A
- Interviews ( Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Art Hindle)
- 'Uncovered' Sound scenes

My only complaint is the lack of subtitles or commentaries, and for that reason I only give 4 stars. Apparently space limitations were the problem on the Special Edition. That would not be a problem on blu ray. It seems the rights to the commentaries from the 2002 Collector's Edition are owned by another company so those were not available, but it seems that new actor commentaries might have been obtained for this edition.

Sadly, Bob Clark was killed by a drunk driver in 2007. For fans wanting the director's commentary, the collector's edition is the only option and will become increasingly harder to obtain.

If you have the Special Edition and an upconvert dvd player you might give this one a miss, as there are no new features to speak of. If you have a blu ray player and don't already own the special edition, the Blu-ray edition is the way to go. Of course, you can hold out for a ""Definitive Edition"".

Black Christmas is the first movie to use the old ""The calls are coming from inside the house"" clich.  This oversight is also consistent with my overlooking Black Christmas as creating the template for slasher movies, and instead giving sole credit to the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>, which was made years later.  So, Black Christmas was unquestionably crucial in the development of horror films in the years to come.  It is monumental in that sense several times over, but it also happens to be a film that possesses both schocking and creepy moments, and an outstanding horror atmosphere that is strongly assisted by unique camerawork and a great score.  This really is a hugely significant movie for those of us who care about horror films.

Black Christmas is directed by Bob Clark, who, ironically perhaps, directed the Christmas movie standard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Story/dp/B001CFLGMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Story</a>.

I remember Hussey fondly from seeing her as Juliet in the 1968 film version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Juliet/dp/0792165055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo & Juliet</a>.  I've always thought that she could very well be one of the most attractive women to ever exist.  It also stars Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin before anyone knew who they were.

The story is supposedly based on some real-life events that took place in Montreal around Christmas.  A sorority house begins getting random obscene calls that get more and more obscene, and eventually descend to bizarre madness and threats of murder.  People go missing and the calls continue.  This is paralleled with a side story of Jessica's (Hussey) relationship with Peter (Keir Dullea) that eventually works effectively toward the movie's climax.

The film ends mysteriously and with subtle despair.  It was more than appropriate and actually quite terrifying.  This is an important movie that will scare you.  It is also a welcome change of pace from the many sappy holiday films we might see this time of year.  I highly recommend this classic.",1229644800,2,2861,6.535809018567639
1426924,4,B00005IC52,"Finally seeing it after all too long, I was glad to see that Black Christmas really holds up. The story of a regular group of sorority girls stalked and murdered by a madman is very much a chilling, suspenseful and engrossing tale. What really works best is how the killer, who is perhaps called Billy, is kept entirely a mystery. We don't know where he comes from, why he does what he does, and often see things from his perspective up in the dark attic. His rants, screams, whispers, glances and shadow is what makes for a really frightening film to this very day.

There are weaker parts to the film though. Margot Kidder is at the forefront of weak sex jokes, and there's also a lot of goofing off with police detectives trying to crack the case.

Overall, I can highly recommend Black Christmas. But this is a case where the original and remake is night and day, so make sure you see the original film. It will give you shivers just in time for a cozy Christmas night, when you're not sure who is coming to visit at night..",1226016000,2,1028,4.37696335078534

Its not a bad movie, just not as great as many of the reviews I see glorifying it. You will have to decide on your own about whether its worth a purchase or not.

1426931,4,B00005IC52,"Most of you know Bob Clark's famous movie ""A Christmas Story,"" which was released Christmas 1984, but ten years earlier, Mr. Clark tried his hand at a different type of ""Christmas"" storytelling, and it doesn't require a prococious narrator to get the message across. Forget the silly remake that was released on Christmas Day a couple of years ago, this 1974 shocker is the one to watch. First of all, it doesn't rely on gore and blood to fill in for the lack of script. Partly the reason why remakes usually are inferior (Planet of the Apes, Psycho, Willy Wonka, Halloween), is there determination to make an already great film better, which is nearly impossible. None of the above mentioned films needed to be improved upon, and Black Christmas can be added to that list.

Black Christmas predates John Carpenter's Halloween by four years, but it provides every thrill of that film, plus its characters are witty and more intelligent. Clark makes good use of POV (point of view) shooting to allow viewers to survey the mayhen through the stalker's eyes. The fact that there are so many things unclear about the character makes us watch and listen more intently. The phone calls are truly creepy, and although Kidder handles the perverted caller flippantly, we are genuinely afraid for her and the other soriety girls. As a bonus, the film also includes Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet, It). I always found her to be an underrated beauty.

Suspenseful and masterful psychological horror slasher thriller is a true masterpiece of the horror genre and is the 70's questinnel slasher movie besides ""Halloween"" and Mario Bava's ""Bay of Blood"" but this was before John Carpenter's classic movie ""Halloween"" ever came to the big screen 4 years later. co-starring John Saxon, this movie from writer-director Bob Clark (who later went on to do ""Porky's"" and ""A Christmas Story"") is a chilling and scary skincrawler that will make you keep guessing till the very end on who is the killer. Unlike many slasher movies that needs extreme gore, this one focuses on characterizations and genuine suspense without being over the top gory, it's one horror movie that deserves it's cult following and is a must see for fans of the genre as it paved the way for major slasher films for years to come such as ""Halloween"", ""Friday The 13th"", ""Sleepaway Camp"", ""Scream"", ""Silent Night DeadlY Night"", ""Maniac"", ""The Burning"", ""Saw"" etc. and a must own as it definitely ranks with ""Psycho"".

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with good extras like a Documentary, seperate interview segments with the stars and midnight screening Q&A with Margot Kidder, Bob Clark and John Saxton.",1198108800,3,1766,4.942760942760943

1426957,5,B00005IC52,"I do like some horror films--like ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Stepford Wives""--nothing too bloody and gory.  And the original 1974 ""Black Christmas"" (directed--surprisingly enough--by Bob ""A Christmas Story"" Clark) is not that bloody and gory.  But it is effectively creepy--and very entertaining.

A brief synopsis: A psychotic intruder decides to live in the attic of a sorority house during the holiday season and begins to kill people right and left.  That's it.  Pretty simple plot.  But it's so well-executed by the director, writer and especially the wonderful cast.

Margot Kidder (before she became Superman's Lois Lane) stars as the alcoholic foul-mouthed sorority sister--and she's a hoot and a half.  Andrea Martin (who would later gain fame on ""SCTV"" and is currently starring in the new Mel Brooks' musical of ""Young Frankenstein"") is the intelligent, voice of reason sister.  And the lovely Olivia Hussey plays the heroine who has a troubled personal life.  Keir Dullea, John Saxon and a hilarious Marian Waldman (as the house mother) also give great performances.  I just Googled Ms. Waldman because I was curious to see what else she starred in.  It seems most of her career was on the stage in Canada--and her nickname was ""Pookie""--and she sadly passed away in 1985.  But I would recommend this film just for her performance--she's that good.  A terrific comic performance, which one wouldn't expect from a film called ""Black Christmas"".

It's funny.  However, I didn't care for the ending when I first saw it years ago.  I won't give it away but I found it unsatisfying--and disturbing.  But having just watched the film again last night and listened to the new interviews with Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder, I now appreciate the ending--and I think it's perfect--but still disturbing.  And speaking of the interviews, this Special Edition DVD is great.  There's also an all-new documentary on the film and a midnight screening Q&A session with director Bob Clark and actor John Saxon.  All of these extras are quite interesting--and add to the overall enjoyment of the film.

So if you're in the mood for a creepy but very amusing little film, check out the original ""Black Christmas"".  It's widely acknowledged as the first modern slasher film--four years before the original ""Halloween"" came out--but it's not too bloody and gory for those of us who just prefer our horror flicks to be scary--with a bit of dark humor thrown in to the mix.  I think you might be surprised at how good this film is.  I know I was--and that's why I've given it 5 stars.  I know it doesn't rank up there with Altman's ""Nashville"" or Allen's ""Annie Hall"" or even the wonderful ""Bringing Up Baby"", but in the genre of horror, ""Black Christmas"" deserves its 5 stars.",1190419200,2,2767,4.947939262472885
1426958,4,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas (Bob Clark, 1974)

""[censored] 5-4429."" Margot Kidder's deadpan recital of a fake phone number to a numbskull cop has stuck with me as one of the best setups in movie history for the past twenty-five years. It's more impressive because, at the time, I had about as much knowledge of what she was on about as the cop (who ends up with an ""aw, it's somethin' dirty, innit?"" when the rest of the boys in the squad room break down in hysterics at his confused expression). For that matter, I was born at that odd time between the death of actual two-letter exchanges and their fading out in the movies, so when I saw Black Christmas, I didn't even know what a two-letter exchange was. And it was still awesome. I remembered nothing else about the movie, though, until I sat down to watch it again last weekend.

While the late Bob Clark is probably more remembered for his stupid teen sex comedies these days (Clark was the man behind Porky's), he started out his career with a trio of grimly humorous horror/suspense films that have, for better or worse, etched themselves deep into the public consciousness. Pieces of dialogue from them have become cliches, while scenes have been imitated endlessly in other, lesser horror films (Black Christmas even earned itself a bland remake in 2006). Black Christmas is the best of the lot, and stands as the first true North American slasher film (America would follow along a couple of years later with Alice, Sweet Alice).

The plot: at the start of the Christmas holidays, the members of a sorority house are stalked by a deranged killer who identifies himself as Billy. When house residents start disappearing, a loose alliance forms between the local lieutenant (John Saxon), a young activist musician (Keir Dullea), his girlfriend (Olivia Hussey), and an abrasive, drunk sorority sister (Margot Kidder) to try and figure out what's going on. As is to be expected with such an investigative team, if they're going to catch the guy, they're going to do it by accident. Things get worse when the lieutenant starts suspecting the musician.

[NOTE: the next paragraph contains what could be construed as spoilers. If you're planning on seeing the movie, do not read anything from here until the final paragraph.]

The genius of this movie (something Clark recognized enough to steadfastly refuse where the distribution company ordered him to reshoot the ending and make it less ambiguous) is that the incompetent nature of the onscreen detectives allows Clark to follow their lead even when the camera is set for an omniscient point of view; we never learn anything more than the characters do. It's simple, and it's brilliant, and the big twist at the end of Halloween looks cheap and tawdry in comparison. (In fact, the ending that it most resembles, to me, is that of Session 9.)

If you're a fan of the slasher film, this is a definite must, as much as any of the foreign slasher films that preceded it. It is from here that the North American movie machine took its twist on the slasher film, and anyone who's seen any of the good ones (or most of the bad ones) will recognize a great deal of this. However, more importantly, it has a number of things that a lot of slasher films were missing during the golden years (and almost all of the new breed lack): subtlety, characterization, subplots, humor that's actually funny, etc. Holds up exceptionally well after more than thirty years. ****",1189987200,,3452,4.773869346733668
1426959,4,B00005IC52,"I had heard of this film, but had never watched it, and decided to watch the remake of Black Christmas that came out last year. That re-make is a piece of garbage, and I knew that there was no way this film, that has been deemed a classic horror masterpiece, could be that bad. And I'm happy to say that I was absolutely right! I really don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said about this really good horror film. Yes, this film pre-dates Halloween by about 4 years, and you can tell that are some elements of Halloween that had already been done in this movie. The biggest similarity to me, would be the Point of View camera work, where we see the house through the ""eyes"" of Billy as he hides in the attic or in the closet, or wherever. Just watch the first 5 minutes of Halloween, and you'll see that same technique. Anyway, the movie itself has a great story to it. I won't bother explaining it again, other reviewers have already done a much better job of doing that than I could do. But what I will say is that this movie has great suspense and horror elements in it. And it pretty much does it without much actual on-screen blood or violence. The obscene phone calls made by the killer throughout the film are done brilliantly, and really do sound creepy. Also, as one review mentioned, I love the way the movie is left open-ended. Without the audience finding out who exactly Billy is, where he came from, who Agnes was..all that stuff. This was one of the many problems with the crappy remake to this film. It tried to tell the whole backstory of the killer with a series of flashbacks, which was stupid as hell, to say the least. So if you're looking at a good suspenseful horror film, with a good story and decent acting,(John Saxson is great, though the sorority house mother is a bit over-the-top), then I suggest you pick this up. And don't forgot...before Michael Myers or Jason or Freddy ever showed up..there was Billy!!!!",1189468800,2,1954,4.430555555555555
1426960,4,B00005IC52,I thought the movie did a pretty good job. The phone calls always gave me chills and I liked that the killer was rarely seen. I always felt like I was trapped in the house with the killer and tried to get out. The middle does drag a little and I didn't like the ending all to much. There is not alot of gore but it was still well done. I highly recommend it to people who love horror movies.,1189209600,,391,3.9

1426984,5,B00005IC52,"Bob Clark directed this 70s slasher gem and also directed the Christmas classic A Christmas story, along with other notable horror and comedies.  In this movie we know very little of the killer, allot of reviewers point out this adds to the mystery and the effectiveness and i would agree.  The 2006 remake fills in a back story of the killer and adds depth, but I, like most prefer this and my own imagination.  Perhaps this killer didn't get that proverbially red rider bee bee gun for Christmas and angered and unable to take out his frustrations with said gun he becomes a deranged killer.
Bad joke.
I consider myself a horror buff but this title for whatever reason has eluded me and I'm seeing it for the first time,(though if i review i watch the movie fresh anyhow) so I miss out on the effect it might have had on me as a younger kid.  Most horror films that are the scariest to us I believe stems from what we saw at a young and impressionable age, when our imaginations were at their peak.  However seeing this at 29 years old it still is a terrifying movie.  For me the part that grabbed me is when the older woman in charge of the girls says goodbye as they are going off with a search party leaving the old woman alone.  As viewers we know who is in that house, and I for a moment  thought of any late ominous night i had said goodbye to friends and was alone, leaves you with an eerie feeling.  In this horror film the killer isn't trying to get in to get you, he's already there so for us the scary part isn't don't go in the woods or who would go there it is when someone goes to bed, or friends leave then we feel the terror, I think we can relate to that terror.  For example think back to when your a child and you saw a horror movie, you really wanted to, you told your parents it's fine and it was.  Now it's dark out, soon it will be bedtime and we can't get those horror movie images out of our heads and we panic.  Maybe we have some friends over for a sleep over and we watch horror films all night, no big deal, then the next night there gone and were alone now those movies are scary, or even if it's daytime and we have to go into the basement alone to do laundry, maybe we sing aloud la la la calmly walking to put the laundry in then as if were tricking said ghosts we bolt for the upstairs.  That's the brief familiar feeling i got when they left for the search party leaving that woman in the house alone, that is where the movie for me got freaky and then didn't let up.
Some have pointed out how Halloween got some of it's ideas from Black Christmas, and that Halloween not Black Christmas is considered such a classic.  I would agree Black Christmas could've very well influenced Halloween, but i wouldn't say steal, Halloween is a classic and deservedly so and Black Christmas in any horror forum or discussion is also considered one by most.  However i would like to point out a movie i felt did directly take from this that i have not heard mentioned, When a Stranger Calls (1979).  Creepy phone calls, a traced call from police, and calls are coming from a second line in the house.  I mean now that is pretty specific, almost makes me like When a Stranger Calls less.
Also some things i thought noteworthy, the calls that come are very freaky the voice is reminiscent of the voices Regan would make from The Exorcist in one of her devilish outbursts.  Olivia Hussey is one of the sexiest sleepers.  The ending is top notch as well.  The only hole i wanted to say something about was the fact this guy is on a phone line upstairs screaming but nobody hears him in the house, however the good heavily outweighs the bad, this is a great horror film with good character development, this movie could even spark up a pro life debate.

The real horror is that Bob Clark and his son were killed by a drunk driver earlier this year April 4, 2007. R.I.P

I guess I was too excited because of all the hype the movie had gotten.
Don't get me wrong though, I am not all disappointed I purchased it, and it's a masterpiece compared to the remake. I was just hoping for a more shocking film, I suppose.
P.S.-The remake is ok, but that back story is gross....",1185408000,,432,4.216867469879518
1426986,4,B00005IC52,"This early 70s gem was ripped off by more popular horror films of the late 70s and early 80s, and its a shame becuase it outshines all of them.

I had always maintained that the first half hour of the ORIGINAL ""When a Stranger Calls"" is one of the scariest pieces of film I'd ever viewed. That was before I saw Black Christmas (which, by the way, predates When a Stranger Calls). When a Stranger Calls starts off very strong and quickly goes down hill whereas Black Christmas goes above and beyond and is consistently creepy without the huge let down at the ending that is typical for many horror films.

There are a few things I didn't like, however. The story isn't completely hole-proof (but is very good for the era). The music/score in times of suspense was annoying as it sounded like someone carelessly pounding on a piano. It was a bit overused. The mumbling/moaning of the killer and his phone calls were like finger nails scratched down a chalk board. These are relatively minor details that do not hamper the effectiveness of this film sending chills down the viewer's spine!",1184803200,,1086,4.6217616580310885
1426987,4,B00005IC52,"This is easily one of the most fun horror movies ever, and one of the most frightening. I would have difficulty watching this alone in the dark. I am fine with ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""Alien"", and ""Halloween"". But not this one. The killer in this movie is too scary. And you hardly ever see him.

It's been referred to as the first true ""slasher"" movie, although there are more interesting methods of killing here than mere slashing! You can tell that the director really had a good time making this. It shows.
It was so innovative, and so influential on the horror movie genre; you've seen it all before in horror films of the 70's, 80's, and 90's... but those movies all copied from this film.
""Black Christmas"" includes techniques and concepts that have since become cliche but were original back in 1974: the unseen maniac hiding in the house, camera angles from his point of view, the disturbing phone calls, very minimal but very effective use of creepy background music, and the solitary female survivor who must try to outwit/escape the bloodthirsty, unhinged psychopath.

There are some truly scary moments (including those really horrifying schizophrenic phone calls about Agnes), but then there are comedy bits peppered throughout. Today's movie audience might not like this original version because it takes its sweet time, relishing and savoring the dread and suspense until the taut climax.

Margot Kidder (Barb) really hams it up playing the brassy, common, boozy, chainsmoking girl. Olivia Hussey (Jess) gives a nice performance. And as her tense pianist boyfriend, Keir Dullea plays the most tempermental musician you'd ever want to meet. I'd never want to be late for an appointment with Peter.

The most exciting moment for me is when the cop on the phone tells Jess to just walk out the front door. That's all she has to do. Just take a few steps and escape. (I will write no further, so the ending won't be ruined for those who haven't seen it yet.)

1426988,5,B00005IC52,"I saw this movie on HBO in the late 1970's, as a kid, under the above listed title.  This one is well worth the watch.  I have watched horror movies my whole life and can honestly say that very few genuinely scared me as much as this one.  (Yes, Halloween and The Exorcist were also very scary the first go 'round, but this movie affected as much as either of these movies).  It may be that nowadays the plot has been repeated ad nauseam but I still feel that the impact of this movie is  viable.  You will not see gore, so you will have to use your imagination. That is a good thing.  Your imagination is far more disturbing than any gore onscreen.  The antagonist, whoever did the voice, is fantastic.  He really sounds crazy, and not in a good way, either.",1179446400,2,759,4.251748251748252
1426989,5,B00005IC52,"The first time I saw it was a year or two after it came out.  I was a teenager and had never seen anything that scary.  This was, remember, several years before the genre of the teenage slasher flick first appeared.

One of the creepiest and most effective things about this movie is that you never got to see the face of the killer.  There was never a reason given for what he did, and you had no idea who he was.  It was just some lunatic who got into the house through a window,  No other explanation given.  Not many scripts or stories have the guts to pull this off.

Once the maniac gets in, he begins a series of chilling, sickening and utterly terrifying phone calls to the sorority girls in the house, who are in the midst of a Christmas party.  You realize, when listening to this psycho, that whatever is wrong with him is beyond a prank, beyond mental illness.  This person is unbelievably twisted and deranged.  The ability he has to shift his voice patterns and imitations, not to mention his hoarse, guttural and violent thrusts when he shouts are what let you know how unspeakably horrifying it is going to be for the parties involved.

The girls have a range of emotions, from frightened, amused, and, provocation, which is a mistake.

A side story of a missing, later found murdered child in a park lends to the growing terror.  A race against time while police try and track the calls from inside the house adds to the tension.

There is no satisfying, feel-good ending.

The great touches in this movie come fom everything you do not see, but from what is inferred.  There is almost no blood in the movie.  You do get to see several murders, but the murders themselves are almost beside the point.  Its the heart-pounding fear leading up to it that makes the movie worth seeing.  None of the slasher movies that followed can touch this one.  What a forgotten piece of work.

Hands down one of the best scary movies ever.",1178755200,3,1940,4.451704545454546

It's that simple and that great. Bob ""Porky's"" Clark take the plot and makes the most of it and although both films are different, just like ""A Christmas Story"", has made a classic that still works after all these years. Now don't get mad at that statement, I just mean that just as that movie has proved to be a classic of movie history so this movie should be thought of also.

Black Christmas introduces the idea of the first person camera killer shot that we see used by John Carpenter in the opening scene of Halloween. And it uses this effect very effectively as we watch a man climbing the trellis of a sorority house into the attic.

The film is paced very slowly, with the killer making phone calls in between murders to speak incoherently and scream into the phone. Everything coming out of the phone is clearly from the mind of a mad man, and leaves the recipient of the call, as well as the viewer, with goosebumps crawling over their skin.

With each murder, the tension grows as the audience wonders when the killer will be discovered. With the momentum that the film starts out with, it's hard to fathom that it can maintain its pace, but it does so and it does so very very effectively.

Black Christmas is a horror classic of the highest rank; it's the kind of horror movie that made the slasher genre so popular, before franchises like Friday the 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, and even Halloween now, turned the genre into dumbed-down presentations of gore, nudity, and one-liners. While those franchises still hold special places in horror-buffs hearts, Black Christmas is the kind of film that brings back what makes horror films work.

The special features are a bit boring, but it's still interesting to hear what some of the actors have to say 30 years later, as well as some Q & A by the director. If you haven't seen Black Christmas yet, and you're a fan of horror movies, definitely check it out.",1175472000,5,1740,4.581993569131833

It was not a gorefest and didn't have any sex scenes that were common to 70's horror, but the psycho in this movie is SO DISTURBING. All of his little voices and things really freaked me out! I thought it was a perfect plot, with perfect execution and a perfect ending that was common to many of the 70's classic horror movie genre. As others have said, it was the predecessor to Halloween and many other scary movies, so they all took bits and pieces from this awesome and underrated movie.

Certainly the birth of the sorority slasher. They didn't have to rely on gore to scare or shock you.

The voice of the phantom caller was enough to make your skin crawl and the character of Billy was so frighteningly genius That just a look at one  eye leering through a peep hole freaked me out for weeks.

That this was made in 1974 is truly amazing.

1427018,4,B00005IC52,"Bob Clark has directed a number of horror films, which, for whatever reason, have found themselves lost or overlooked in the dusty, cobweb filled catacombs of horror history. His excellent satires of the Vietnam conflict and the counter-culture in ""Death Dream"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" respectively, often get overlooked. The same can be said for his prototype slasher film ""Black Christmas"". The credit tends to be given to ""Halloween"", although a superior film, Carpenter's effort steals wholesale a number of motifs from Clark's film which went on to define the slasher film (point of view shots from the killer's perspective, a seasonal connection, sexually precocious teenagers etc). Where Clark's film differs is in its implied nastiness. The killer, judging from his vitriolic phone manner is one of cinema's true enigmas. Never glimpsed, Clark does stretch things somewhat by having the psycho live in the sorority house. We only get tantalising hints as to the killers mixed up mental state. The reason Clark is able to leave his film so open-ended and so riddled with more questions than answers is because it was an independent production, and this probably explains its disappearance into the mists of film history. Nevertheless the film has some notable actors (Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Margot Kidder), which have helped to ensure it has something of a cult following. ""Black Christmas"" is an essential stepping stone in the development of 1970's horror and must be rewritten into the canon of key horror works.",1173225600,3,1547,5.216867469879518

This is quite possibly the worst horror movie ever made with the exception of 28 Days Later and the first Sleepaway Camp. It is so slow its pathetic to the point of going to sleep but i finished it anyway because i wasted my money on it. You know most horror movies start out slow and pick up in the middle but thats not the case here. Its fine not to kill the killer but at least let me see who he is or something. Is that supposed to do something for me because he's still a mystery or what? In summary this movie may have scared me 25 years ago when i was three, but now it just makes me not want to watch horror films anymore.

I've always been interested in seeing it because of the praise it reaps, and I love seventies horror films as much as the next horror fan. Plus its a classic that not a whole lot of people know about except those who are fans of the genre. If I had to say one thing that kept me from viewing it, I've always been turned off by the fact that its a Bob Clark film. Clark of the Baby Genius and Karate Dog ilk is a director I avoid at all costs. I have to say after viewing this its a shame He doesn't have another go at the horror genre making another quiet and dark film like this.

Maybe its because I'm tired of all the modern horror films being Asian influenced (badly) or suplementing suspense with gore and brutaility but I was impressed greatly with this film. It was nice dark and sinister film with a good cast led by Olivia Hussey and John Saxon and a villain Clark smartly never reveals except in a few shadowy reveals during attacks. The killers phone calls were well done and sinister and a couple of P.O.V. shots (especially one where he goes ape and tears apart the attic where he's hiding) added to the character. Everything in this was classy and one of the main things I loved of the genre. If only one thing didn't work, it was little of that lame humor that characterizes Clarks comedies. Humor like horror is different for the viewer I say, but here it just didn't work for me.

1427043,5,B00005IC52,"This sleeper/cult film is a true gem to those who like thrillers. It has survived over 30 years and is still going strong. That is indeed the trademark of a classic.

When this film was released in 1974 it didn't do well. There was a film released back in '63 that was also a good little slasher film, but with a different type of story called 'Dementia 13'. One thing I can see this film borrowing from that one is where the camera is sometimes shot from the view of the killer. But in Black Christmas the killer is never revealed.

It is also easy to see where following films borrowed, and may have added, from this one. Halloween certainly did borrow and added the music. Friday the 13th also borrowed the gathering of young people and the slashing.

Two others that I believe have borrowed are the original 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Scream'. The scenes where the telephone becomes the instrument with which to terrorize are directly from this one.

So... in a number of ways this film set many standards of thrilling and chilling.

After seeing this movie for the first time after about 25 years I began to realize all of this. This film also has enough humor to balance the fright, simple sets, simplistic acting, direct lines and great sets. It really does have it all.

1427074,5,B00005IC52,"I'm ashamed of myself. I'm a big horror/scary movie fan, but this is the first time I have ever seen the quiet little gem that is Black Christmas. Where have I been and what can I do to make up for the loss?. Watch it dozens of times this holiday season?. Okay!. Director Bob Clark's film is a beautiful movie. But more on that later. Widely reported that the film is similar in ways to Halloween, but Halloween came out 4 years later, is true. A few girls stalked by a maniacal killer in a big house on a holiday. Okay. POV shots of the killer's vision. Check. Nothing will overcome my undying love for Carpenter's film. Black Christmas is a great movie, but not as great as Halloween. But who cares. It's wonderful all on it's own. The movie takes places in Bedford(get it?), during the Christmas holiday. A few sorority girls are staying behind at their sorority house for the holidays. Jess(Olivia Hussey), Barb(Margot Kidder), and Phyl(Andrea Martin), are among those few. Unbeknownst to them, a strange sicko has climbed into the attic and plays his maniacal game with the young ladies. He harasses them with obscene calls, and then starts taking them out one by one. It seems simple, as it is, but is incredibly effective. Just like Halloween was. Bob Clark crafts a film that is obviously, and wonderfully, in the 70's, and that's what gives these older films character and ambiance. The film looks good, and Clark infuses the film with the right feel and tone of the season, while something dastardly is going on. Knowing what's going on(and what is to come)while hearing the haunting echos of ""Silent Night"" or any other Christmas tune in the background is haunting and eerie. Like Halloween, the movie is all about tone, fear, suspense, and utter terror. Light on the blood and overly photogrpahed death scenes, the movie builds on it's suspense as the minutes tick by. Just like...well, you know. I was surprised with how funny the film was too. The housemother, Ms. Mack, is a hoot!. The rest of the cast is good too. Olivia Hussey is engaging as Jess, our heroine. Lovely, sweet, but can take care of herself if need be. Margot Kidder played her character Barb wonderfully as well. John Saxon also appears in the film. And then there is our killer. But who is he?. Billy. We never really get to see the killer(part of the film's charm and one of their clever tricks), and we are left at the end not knowing anything more than when the film started. Bad ending?. No. It's great. It leaves you with unanswered questions, and sometimes leaving them unanswered is far more interesting and creepy than having everything explained. The extras here are okay, but nothing special. Some of the interviews(mainly the seperate ones with Hussey and Kidder)seem cheap and amateurish. You can't really hear the questions they are being asked either. In the end, Black Christmas is a tightly packaged scare ride with great atmosphere, mood, suspense, and scares.

1427076,4,B00005IC52,"Released several years before the original ""Halloween"", ""When a Stranger Calls"" and ""Friday the 13th"", this overlooked and under-rated horror film isn't as famous as its imitators but is superior in almost all aspects with the sole exception of Carpenter's ""Halloween"". Like ""Halloween"", this film has a low body count and is low on gore but offers loads of thrills, some spills and suspense.

The story involves sorority sisters Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin, who are terrorized on Christmas Eve by a homicidal maniac. The killer has made his way inside the Sorority house (not a spoiler since this is shown in the first couple of minutes in the film) and takes refuge in the attic. By using their telephone, he manages to call the helpless victims and torture them mentally with some really nasty phone calls. The unsuspecting girls are unaware that the calls are coming from within the house and several of them fall victim to the caller's homicidal tendencies. Although we never get to see the lurking killer, we do get to hear him and his phone calls are grisly and excruciatingly chilling.

""Black Christmas"", in my opinion, is one of the best films of the genre. It's definitely one of the best ""slasher"" films and on the same level as the classic ""Halloween"". It offers good performances (Margot Kidder is especially delightful), a great cast (along with the 3 leading female stars, John Saxon and Keir Dullea also turn in good performances), loads of suspense and it moves along at a pretty good pace. Unlike the later less ingenious but gorier films of its kind, ""Black Christmas"" is executed so brilliantly that there is no need to throw in buckets of blood in order to shock and to make its point. You will be squirming with tension and fear as you see Hussey try to stay calm and collected as she listens to the vulgarly offensive ramblings of the insane caller. This is definitely one of those films that will have you saying ""don't go in there!"" or ""hurry up and get out of there!"". It is a shame that this clever little shocker went unnoticed for so many years considering that its light years ahead of the more famous films it inspired. ""Black Christmas"" is shocking, skillfully constructed and innovative (for it's time). It needs to be in every horror film fans DVD collection. Let's just hope the remake (which will be released shortly) doesn't manage to screw it up; highly recommended.

1427077,5,B00005IC52,"I am 35 years old and I remember when this first came out on HBO back in the early 80's.  I believe I was either ten or eleven when I first saw it.  My parents went to sleep right before it came on and I stayed up to watch it (which they wouldn't have let me in any way if they knew this movie!).  This was the movie that put a deep dread AND fascination in me for horror movies and suspense/thrillers.  It terrified me beyond words, yet as good horror movies do they take you for a ride that thrills you to your core.  Man, I remember the unbelievable dread at the end of the movie and after it was over I remember saying to myself ""That was the most scared I've ever been"".

There have been times as an adult that took me back to the horror that this movie implanted in me as a child....One night, sleeping in my apartment alone, I was suddenly awoken by my door opening.  I slept in almost complete darkness at the time.  I jumped into the ""fight or flight"" mode and the flight took control...I screamed and screamed like a little girl throwing my pillow at the unseen attacker!  I was able to turn on the lights and I came to find out that the wind (during the summer with windows open) was responsible for pushing my door open when it wasn't shut all the way.  I woke up my neighbors with the screams and commotion I made and they called the cops thinking I was being murdered!  LOL  Man was I embarrassed!  But after it was over I remembered that that fear I felt was  so similar to the fear I first felt when I watched Black Christmas all those years before.

Another instance when, I was a teen, I remember watching a news broadcast which told of a stranger living in the basement of a family's house for several months before the family found out.  I believe the man was insane and would come upstairs in the dead of night to sneak food and use the bathroom.  Apparently he would go upstairs while everyone slept and watch them.  He didn't hurt them, but MAN!  That gave me the same creeps that this movie did.  It made me search every square inch of my house, during the day with a shotgun!  I guess it just goes to show that a truly good scary movie like this one can really get under your skin!

Some folks give this movie a four, three and even two star rating, which amazes me.  There really is no film that compares with this one for the creepiness and dread.  I think that the younger folks who are more used to the modern horror movies just can't appreciate, I believe, the genius of the suspense, dread and insane-ness of this movie.  We will see the same reaction with the new re-make of this movie coming out in theaters this Christmas (2006).  I've seen the few teasers and trailers for the new movie and it looks awful compared to the original.  They have to include such gore and what I call ""flesh shock"" to try to make something out of the new movie which tells me that the terror isn't there.  Movies like Black Christmas, Halloween and TCM never relied on blood or gore for its horror, and I believe movies that do, generally speaking, just aren't good horror movies.  Its the psychological horror that counts, not the blood or gore.

If you are twenty five and younger, try watching this movie by yourself, alone in the dark of night.  You'll then understand that feeling of deep dread and ""creepiness"" that will make you stop the movie, turn on all the lights and re-check the windows and doors and the closets and under the bed...and maybe even the attic if you have the strength to do so!",1166313600,90,3519,4.286363636363636

Being the more youthful horror buff that Hollywood seems to try to cater to, I am happy to say that this film manages to make many of the modern slasher flicks seem tame.

Yes, this film is an older one... and yes, some of the acting mimics that time (which seemed mostly follwing the addage ""let the clothes and hair act for you..."") but this film had some rather decent and jarring moments.

The first obscene phone call is one of those highlights as it gets nasty and the ""girls"" all seem facinated yet mortified by what is being said. Then there is a scene later when one of the girls gets a ""frightening"" glimpse of the killer that not only scared her but scared me as well. That eye, man... it was that freaky eye.

I am glad I finally broke down and bought this thrilling number and I can tell you right now that the upcomming remake will undoubtedly fail at comming close to matching the thrills and chills of this gem. (I'll still see it though... but I'm wary)

I've had the Black Christmas 25th Anniversary Edition (with standard aspect ratio), so when I heard about a new Widescreen Special Edition, I pre-ordered it.  I received it yesterday and viewed it on my 26"" widescreen LCD TV.  Expecting not only more image (on the sides from the widescreen aspect ratio), but also a better picture from the new digital transfer (according to the DVD), I was disappointed to find neither!  The picture was much grainier than the 25th Anniversary Edition, which surprised me.

Since I have a second standard aspect ratio LCD TV (a little smaller, but same manufacturer - Panasonic), which sits next to my widescreen TV, I decided to do a head-to-head comparison.  Simultaneously, I viewed the 25th Anniversary Edition and the new Widescreen Special Edition.  Not only was the Widescreen Special Edition image not as clear as the 25th Anniversary Edition image, but there wasn't any additional image on the sides compared to the standard aspect edition.  As a matter of fact, there was LESS IMAGE at the top and bottom on the widescreen edition.  Ah ha...now I get it.  I concluded that they must have taken a film originally made with a standard aspect ratio and resized it for widescreen viewing.  Sort of like viewing a standard aspect ratio picture in zoom mode on a widescreen set.  You lose image top and bottom and the picture becomes grainier, but it fills the widescreen image area.  I even viewed the standard aspect 25th Anniversary Edition on my widescreen set (in normal mode - with the black side bars) to confirm that the image was crisper on that version on both TV sets, and it was.

I'm no expert at this stuff, but it makes sense to me.  Of course most films made for the theatre have been shot in widescreen since the mid-fifties, but maybe they filmed it in standard to position it for TV viewing.

So in conclusion, if you want the best (and most complete) image and don't mind a standard aspect ratio, I recommend the 25th Anniversary Edition.  That's the one I'll be viewing...Have a Merry Black Christmas Everyone!",1165536000,12,2143,4.748648648648649
1427102,5,B00005IC52,"Before you pine for an ""old fashioned"" Christmas, back in the ""good old days"", remember that back in the 70's (and before) we did not have caller ID, and tracing a phone call to it's point of origin was a difficult and lenghly process. Why the history lesson?? Simple as it lays an important groundwork for this fright fest.

The setting for this movie is pre-Chritmas at a sorority house set at a New England college campus. The sisters are all planning for their trips home for Christmas, and things at the house are winding down. The wiskey ladden house mother, and her charges are a typical lot of coeds. We have a lush, a virgin, and assorted other sorority types.  However we learn that the someone who climbed the treelace into the attic was not in search of shelter, but rather fresh victims, and the coeds start to fall one by one.

Through is all the house is subject to a constant stream of annoying sometimes obsence phone calls.

Little does anyone know where the calls are really coming from (see my opening notes). This is a true horror movie, it is not long on gore, but very long on fright and horror. The viewer knows just what is happening, but not the coeds.  Does this tale have a happy ending?, no, and that is perhaps the best part.

Strong performances are turned in by Margo Kidder, as the lush of the house, and no she did not play the House Mother, Olivia Hussey as a fellow coed who is pregnant, and her VERY creepy boyfriend, Keir Dullea.

1427104,5,B00005IC52,"This film is an underrated classic. The suspense it builds is so creepy. It has probably THE most crazy psycho in film history. The actors are all good and believable. This and Superman are Margot Kidder's best films. The most original ending for a slasher film I've ever seen. The picture still has some grain. It should have been restored or at least remastered in THX. Look how good ""Halloween"" and other old, low budget films from the time look on dvd. However, at least it's finally in anamorphic widescreen which is great. The new 5.1 surround really improves the film although it seemed a little on the quiet end, so I turned it up a little louder than usual. I heard musical details and dialogue I'd never noticed before, it made it creepier. The interviews on this dvd again suffer from some poor audio, as in previous dvd versions. It's hard to hear the questions the interviewer is asking, but otherwise the new interviews were great. The 2 scenes with a different sound mix were no big deal. I wish it had a commentary(preferably a new one, and not a recycling from previous releases), trailer, and was subtitled for dialogue that's hard to understand. Alas, this is the best presentation of the film on dvd so far and definately worth buying if you're a hardcore fan. I give 5 stars for the film and 3 stars for this dvd version, 2 stars for the previous collector's edition, and 1 star for the first dvd version(25th Anniversary edition). There will probably be at least 2 more versions before they FINALLY get it right",1162944000,12,1533,4.619047619047619
1427105,4,B00005IC52,"In the 70's, nobody wanted to see THE SOUND OF MUSIC or WEST SIDE STORY anymore. They wanted to see JAWS, more films like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, cheap and potent violence like THE HILLS HAVE EYES, THE TEXAS CHEINSAW MASSACRE and THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT... and DEATH WISH...

Those were the times...

BLACK CHRISTMAS was one of those films that helped drive the audience towards that new genre that was just emerging: cheap, violent, nasty, urban terror where mass murderers would go bolder and bolder until the 80's came bringing those countless sequels. (laughs)

It's time for Christmas and all the girls at the sorority make plans for the holiday... except Jessica who is left behind with her own problems (she is thinking about an abortion and fighting her boyfriend who is againt is). Suddenly, strange anonymous phone calls are beginning to put them on edge. When Clare disappears, they contact the police, who don't express much concern. A girl if found dead in the park. They set up a wiretap to the sorority house and Jessica agrees to play the part...

...but the killer has been inside the house all this time doing what he does best. Kill.

Obviously this film is quite an interesting entry in the 70's typical slasher movie. And a very good one. And it is sad that nobody today even remembers about all the stir it caused back then.

It is not as violent as today's slashers and... if we think about it... none of those 70's films are. But thirty years after... they still got the goods and many of us cann still feel the ""magic"" those audiences felt back then.

BLACK CHRISTMAS is a good example and should be given a look.

Those who were alive back then (even the younger ones like me who weren't allowed to see them) and caught most of these films when they were fresh will agree with me... there's something about those films that is missing today... a flavour, perhaps... I don't know...  :P",1162166400,10,1916,4.578947368421052

This movie is set around Christmas time and has a crazed psycho tormenting a group of soriroty sisters. From the opening credits you see him sneak into the attic and it is just plain frightening.

This movie doesnt rely on gore, or nudity. Actually our hero is thinking about an abortion. The film relies on suspense and vivid murder sequences. I know I'll never have a unicorn in my home again.

After recieving my review copy in the mail, I was pleasently suprised. The anamorphic HD transfer looks amazing, very little dust and debris is shown. The commentary is very fun and gives us a look into production of this little Canadian masterpiece. My review copy had none of the other features included.

I am actually impressed as to how this movie turned out the way it did. Bob Clark is most famous for Porky's and A Christmas Story! In a way it is fun to know this fact. Try watching BC and ACS one after another and see what happens.

Period. Not high on blood, but very high on suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended.",1161820800,2,925,5.430555555555555
1427108,4,B00005IC52,"This is one of those movies that will likely stay with you for one reason or another a while after viewing it. Initially for me, the ending left too many unanswered questions, such as: who is Billy and why is he terrorizing and killing these young women? The ambiguity didn't set very well with me at first, though the more I thought about it, the more I came to regard it as more positive than negative. I am weary of horror/mystery movies trying to introduce several possible killers and motives, only to clumsily force it all together at the climax. That is usually either too contrived to be effective or too obvious to make it worth the time we spend watching it. *Possible spoilers* ""Black Christmas"" doesn't offer a motive or even tell us who the killer is, which leaves a very chilling effect on the viewer. The unknown is always more frightening than what is known, which is why this film is effective. Sorority sisters regard obscene phone calls as a prank, at least until a local thirteen-year-old girl is found murdered. Suddenly the disappearance of fellow sister, Clare, seems much more ominous than it had previously. The police begin surveillance of the sorority house and tap the phones in an attempt to trace the calls. Will their efforts prove successful? The cast, especially Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and John Saxon, is quite good. The writing, direction and above all the inventive cinematography are all wonderful.

1427109,5,B00005IC52,"This is the scariest movie I've ever seen - more terrifying even than ""Psycho."" It deserves to be better known.

The only element that detracts from the impact of this film is the characters' gratuitous unpleasantness towards each other. ""Black Christmas"" is ahead of its time in substituting japing for real dramatic interaction. The sorority housemother is especially over-the-top offensive. When a father comes looking for his mysteriously missing daughter who hasn't come home for Christmas break - this housemother is so sloppily rude to him - you can't help but wish whatever menace is lurking around the place will take her out next.

But the actors all do the best with the limited range scripted for their characters. Olivia Hussey provides something of a more sympathetic, leavening influence in this wasp's nest. Margot Kidder is perfect as the flip coed who injects a note of humor when she takes advantage of a police officer's limited sexual vocabulary. Keir Dullea poses a convincing threat as a moody, angry music student at the university.

But whatever the movie may lack in character development, it more than makes up for with sheer suspense. I have re-run this film roughly once every two years since it came out in the 70s. Even though I now know exactly what's going to happen next, I still can't bear to watch the screen sometimes. This movie is that FRIGHTENING!",1159574400,2,1387,4.944206008583691

With repeated viewings I have come to see what a masterpiece it really is. There are no plotholes; everything works together perfectly. The unique camera direction throughout leads to a genuine sense of urgency. Your heart rate quickens and your eyes go without blinking for minutes at a time. It's one of those where you want to scream at the character to not go in there (yet you realize that you'd probably end up doing the same thing).",1159574400,3,750,4.646616541353383

It's a plot you've no doubt heard before, but Black Christmas did it earlier and better than all after it, and the performances by Hussey and bad girl Kidder are utterly believable.  Look for strong turns from 2001: A Space Odyssey's Keir Dullea, and B-movie god John Saxon as well.

There are some truly frightening moments in this film, and not the jump-at-you scares found so often in today's horror, but the slow build, tension filled kind of terror all but lost in today's flicks. If you are a fan of horror, no matter what era, YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS MOVIE!!!! Sure, some of the 70's hair-styles and fashions are tough to look at, but once you get beyond that you are going to find a gem of a horror film.

I heard it was a slasher film as slasher films now a days suck like hell, but this was made before Halloween and Friday the 13th, which kept me interested. It took me a long time to find it, but when I did I could see that this is more than your average slasher.

The film is based around Christmas. Sorority girls are planning to take a holiday break. But a stranger who makes frightning phone calls leads to a more psychotic event that night.

We are introduced to the killer through first person perspective as this is the way we always see him. This isn't your typical slasher movie with typical hack'n'slash death scenes of blood and gore but instead gives us a great amount of dark eerie events of intense psychological horror within these killings. Again, another horror film that shows horror doesn't require bloodshed.

Although Black Christmas doesn't exactly contain truly terrifying scenes but instead contains a great creepy effect of silence throughout the sorority house and with probably the most creepy annonymous phone calls ever in a film. The tension and eerieness builds up brilliantly with great replacements of light, shadow and sound, leaving us to the end, with a creepy essence of dark atmosphere, with some things unanswered.

And while Black Christmas contains no cheap attempts of modern day jump frights, this is a great horror film of its kind. Totally recommended.",1151107200,2,1451,4.792
1427139,5,B00005IC52,"In a time when the average horror movie is a bad remake of a classic, based on a video game or just a pathetic excuse to indulge in special effects, films like ""Black Christmas"" makes one realize that horror doesn't mean graphic, too clever for words or necessarily outlandish tactics.  Films such as this one, ""Halloween"" and countless other great horror flicks are effective primarily because they take the every day and fill it with an unnerving sense of terror and vulnerability.  I saw this baby back in when it was first released and it scared me as much today as it did back in `74.  The killer inside the house premise that was explored with equal success in the fantastic ""When a Stranger Calls"" (the original) is so terrifying because unlike ""When a Stranger..."" in the end, he is never caught but rather is still lurking somewhere inside the house, waiting.  Most people consider their homes a sanctuary and what is more unsettling than knowing that it no longer is, that unbeknownst to you it has, in fact, become a death trap and that with every passing minute peril inches closer?  This fantastic example of modern horror relies, like most of the fine films that emerged during the horror heydays of the 70's and early 80's, on tension, atmosphere, ingenious use of sound and silence, light and shadow.  I don't scare easily and having seen all of the ""great"" horror movies, I still count this one among the creepiest and unsettling.  BTW - everyone was great with Margot Kidder having a seemingly great time as the foul-mouthed, tough talking, hard driking sorority girl.  Olivia Hussey in the more demure and complex role was equally good.  It's a very well made little gem and it shouldn't be overlooked if you love horror.  Don't pay too much notice to those nay sayers below, because ""Black Christmas"" is true horror and not that visual and sonic schlock that tries to pass for it nowadays.  If you were born in the age of excess (post-1975), chances are that you wouldn't know good horror if it bit you on the rump.",1150848000,4,2035,4.6722689075630255

I did for quite a while, and, don't get me wrong, Halloween is a classic of massive proportions.  However, Black Christmas is somehow constantly overlooked.  Even I, a devoted horror fan, had somehow never seen this movie, even though I claim to be an expert on all things horror cinema.

After finally watching this film, I am not disappointed at all, and it frustrates me even more that it can be so ignored by most horror fans.  The plot of Black Christmas is really simple: a group of sorority sisters are getting ready to all head home for Christmas break, and on the last night together on campus, they start to receive weird, disturbing, perverted phone calls.  Soon after the film starts, we are introduced to the killer through a first-person view as he climbs into the attic.  The film starts out fairly slow and unfocused.  We are introduced to a few characters who seem as if they are going to be important but never really pan out.  Once the film ""slims down"" its cast, it gains much more tension and ability to actually scare the viewer.  Jess, the main character, is actually a pretty good actress, and, while she does buy into some stupid horror cliches, she is a very believable and sympathetic character that we have to root for.

The film obviously wasn't trying to win any awards for screenplay or acting, but the film succeeds on almost every level that a horror movie strives for.  It achieves a large amount of tension, a good number of genuine scares, and it makes the viewer grit their teeth even though it avoids most gore throughout the entire film.  While the film may feel a little choppy, and it seems like  it doesn't make very good use out of its limited run time, you have to give it major credit for being the first movie to jump into this genre and do it without fear.

Those phone calls!  They are disturbing to hear today as they were to listen to years ago when ""Black Christmas"" was first released.  The rage and violence of the killer's voice is so explosive, so disturbing, that it elevates the typical formula of the movie (sorority house, isolated chicks being picked off by a psycho killer, clumsy cops) into the genuine ""cult"" zone. ""Black Christmas""deserves its reputation not so much because of anything new or groundbreaking as far as thrillers go - but because it remembers the one thing you need in such a movie (with all its limitations): a truly frightening killer.

Black Christmas came out in the mid 70s and it pioneered the way for so many other slasher films of the later 70s - present day, hence they are remaking this movie as we speak.  I just hope that they do not screw it up.  I always get a little scared when Hollywood decides to fix something that is not broken to begin with.

The story is set in a sorority house during Christmas time and most of the sorority girls are leaving for the holidays, but a handful of girls stay behind along with their housemother for the break.  A psycho climbs the outside of the house and into the attic of the home, and from that point on chaos ensues.

The cops are bumbling idiots, the scares are few and far between (although the eye peering through the door crack totally creeped me out) and why doesn't anyone check the attic or at least look in the window? I'm sorry, but when the killer throws a tantrum in the attic NOBODY hears him?  Come on. It's worth a watch to see a pre-Lois Lane Margot Kidder as the potty mouth, chain smoking alcoholic (although she is much better in Brian DePalma's creepy Sisters which came out a year before this) and John Saxon pretty much plays the same role he did in A Nightmare On Elm Street.

The movie delivered some pretty good gore, which in my opinion was pretty few and far between for the first hour, but then got going in a very climatic ending sequence. The characters were great, and the plot was very unique and well executed. From the mid point on to the end, this movie is very close to a masterpiece. However, getting to that climatic point, for me at least, was a task.

I personally felt this movie started off slow, and in a way it helps and in a way it fails. The slowness makes the ending climax very powerful, but makes about 20 minutes of the movie very hard to watch. I still don't know why so many people put thi film in their top ten. It isn't at all a bad film, but it really isn't great either. It has a lot, but what it lacks sort of evens it out to a marginally good film.

Directed by Bob Clark, best known for his other Christmas movie ""A Christmas Story"", but the two movies couldn't be more different. Definitely his best movie, and Black Christmas was one of the better movies of the 1970's. Watching the movie it is very obvious that other movies that came later took a lot from this. Movies like When A Stranger Calls, Unhinged, Halloween and The House On Sorority Row were all great films that seemed to have nods to Black Christmas. It's not your typical Christmas movie.

1427192,5,B00005IC52,"""Black Christmas"" is probably the best film among the slasher genre that I have ever seen. I'm absolutely amazed that this film is not more widely known. ""Black Christmas"" is permeated throughout with one of the eeriest, creepiest atmospheres ever seen in any film before as well as one of the most disturbing twists at the ending. This movie makes Carpenter's ""Halloween"" look like a film made for children. Definitely worth watching for any fan of horror films, I  rate this one up with better known classics such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" A truly frightening film.",1132012800,5,575,4.927835051546392

After watching this movie I realize how many horror movies that came after it that copied this classic. One of the things I like about older horror movies is the fact they provide ""mystery"" to the movie. Unlike with movies now that have an ""happy"" ending. Movies like this leave u wondering who was the killer? Definatly a buy for those that love classic horror movies.",1130284800,,491,4.52808988764045
1427195,4,B00005IC52,"This is a nasty little piece of work. If you are looking to pay money in exchange for a sleepless night, you couldn't do much better than ""Black Christmas"", a film which hasn't lost its ability to scare the crap out of you thirty years after it was shot.

This film, from the 'less is more' school of horror movies, serves notice in the first 30 seconds that it means you and its characters a lot of harm. It begins with a decorous shot of a big, festively lit and suspiciously isolated sorority house; immediately it switches to the POV shot of a mouth-breathing and univited guest, who promptly climbs a latticework up into the attic and makes himself comfortable there....unbenknownst to the residents. We don't know who the intruder is, but it sure as hell ain't Santa Claus.

Inside the party the film wastes no time establishing its female leads: hard-drinking, abraisive city-girl Barb (Margot Kidder, delightful as a queen bitch), ""professional virgin"" Claire, nerdily charming Phyl, coldly self-absorbed Olivia Hussey, and closet drunk house mother Mrs. Mack. It makes no effort to establish who the ""main character"" is, and by doing so leaves you with the distinct (and correct) impression that no one is safe.

In addition to the gals, there are three boyfriends, a fat guy with a ridiculous 70s-era afro, thrown in for comic relief; a cool hockey player named Chris (complete with goalie mask)who wears a Joe Namath fur pimp coat, and a high-strung aspiring concert pianist, Peter, who fulfills the the ""is he or isn't he the killer"" role very nicely.

What follows could be called your standard ""ten little Indians"" scenario, as the sorority girls, who are in the process of packing up for Christmas break, are stalked and eliminated by the gibbering lunatic hiding in the attic. As is often the case in horror movies, the ladies don't know there's a killer amongst them until it's way past too late, busy as they are with their personal problems, petty rivalries, and a series of increasingly bothersome obscene phone calls. And even when they finally get the word, both they and the police (represented by the fine John Saxon) can't quite seem to grasp that the important thing is not so much who the killer is, but where he is....

""Black Christmas"" achieves its terror the old fashioned way: by providing us with well-drawn, well-acted characters that we care about, rather than the usual acting-skool dropout slasher fodder; by clever and skillfull camerawork that takes us deep into a truly disturbing mind; by clever misdirection and a lot of unanswered questions; and by skimping on the gore in favor of letting the audience's imaginations run bloody riot. In addition, the obscene phone calls, which consist of a combination of gibberish, giggling, screaming, squealing, breathing, and X-rated profanity, are so disturbing that as the film wears on, every ring of the telephone has the viewer feeling more and more like upchucking the spicy Chinese food he was stupid enough to eat while watching. And I won't even get into the horrible ""plastic wrap"" posing the corpse thing in the attic. That is truly the stuff nightmares are made of.

Like all horror films it has some flaws, most notably in the logic department, and the ""unanswered questions"" approach, while very effective, is also occasionally annoying. One might accuse the screenwriter of using this approach so as to be able to cheerfully ignore closing some gaping plot holes. There is also a grotesque piece of foreshadowing when Mrs. Mack complains that a certain crucial door has a tendency to stick. Gee, wonder if it will stick later, when a certain sorority girl REALLY needs it to open? But overall these are minor bones to pick. It's a good script, and was very well-executed.

If you are a fan of intelligent horror flicks that rely on brain rather than blood 'n brawn, ""Black Christmas"" is for you. Just don't expect to get a lot of sleep afterwards.

----end of review/beginning of SPOILERS!!! or rather some things people who haven't seen the movie shouldn't read--------

Some questions & surmises I have after watching the flick:

1) Who killed the girl in the park? Was this the work of the killer before he went into the house, or is this the work of somebody else, perhaps Peter? Or is it just misdirection?

2) Who killed the cop outside the house? It seems unlikely the killer could climb out of the attic, sneak up on the cop, open the door, slit his throat, and get back in the house unnoticed. He sure as hell didn't go out the front door. Did the ""other"" killer get him? Was it Peter?

3) Who the F are Agnes and Billy? My guess would be that they once had a child together, possibly in that very same house, but either she had an abortion (and so he killed her and went insane afterwards) or they killed the child together (""Pssst, Agnes, it's me....Billy. Don't tell them what we did!"") and this drove Billy bonkers.

Questions to ponder as I watch the film again and forfeit yet another good night's sleep.",1130025600,2,5016,4.771626297577854
1427196,5,B00005IC52,"When I got my hands on this DVD then saw it for the first time, it was unbelievable that the same guy who made that funny little ditty of a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY made this dark, menacing horror-thriller. It also has one of the best endings of a horror film in years, and was pre-Halloween. I do have to agree that Carpenter did take some of this movie as, at the very least, an inspiration. But these are two different directors doing to big films that have both become, in their own right, classics.

The story revolves around a group of sorority girls who are staying at a sorority house over Christmas break. None of them have any idea that there's something...somebody in the attic. All of the actors here are in fine form, with Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and John Saxon leading the way. I really liked the fact that Margot Kidder did not play an innocent girl like Lois Lane was in the later SUPERMAN movies. I think I relished her more in the drunk now, sleep later woman. It's clumsy but it's so believable and great. The best part of this movie is that you never see the killer, but you do see his shadow and an eye, but that's all you get...you will never find out who the killer is in the movie. It's actually better that way, it leaves you hungering for more. John Saxon never wastes and scenes here...he chews up his scenery with grace and poise. Good man! The one death in the movie that was so surreal was the glad wrap killing, where the girl was suffocated, then propped up in the attic in the chair where no one finds her, and the insane killer has his way. That one scene where he goes crazy up there has to be terrifying...no one would want to find a crazy, even a monster like this, up in their attic. And who can forget the ending, which leaves nothing discovered and everything left wide open (sadly, Bob Clark never made a sequel...it would have been interesting to see what happens next).

As it stands alone, BLACK CHRISTMAS is a cult classic. It's scary, creepy, terrifying, and downright splendid. Never seeing the face of the killer or who it is ultimately adds to the unbearable suspense you will feel in certain places throughout the movie. A classic in its own right, you won't be feeling very good after seeing this 'CHRISTMAS'. By the way, is anyone going up to the attic?",1129766400,2,2310,4.42018779342723
1427197,4,B00005IC52,i really enjoyed this movie. it kept me guessing until the end but the surprise ending was not what i expected.  all you horror movie buffs this is a must have for your collection.,1129680000,,180,4.294117647058823
1427198,4,B00005IC52,"A slasher film to be appreciated. While you only see 2 murders ( 1 a smothering and the other a stabbing, which is pretty brutally done ), the others are all there and you know, and although they don't show the murders, this movie keeps you in suspense. A well done plot and very creepy feeling to the moviE.

Basically a sorority house full of young ladies start getting very menacing and threating perverted phone calls, only to find out that the stalker is making the calls from inside the house and trying to kill them off one by one.

While this movie lacks in gore extremely, it doesnt lack in anything else. The acting is fine, the directing/edioting is fine,  the feel of suspense and terror is very much so there. When you are done you will appreciate this for what it is and thats a top of the line slasher flick that does not have to use tons of vi=ewable gore and violence to make the film good just the feeling of knowing what is going on, truly  one of the best slasher films ever made.

It took me a second time of watching to truly appreciate this and realize it was made on intelligence and thrived on a very good story line and very EERIE feeling than anyything else a sup[erb money worth getting and with no question a classic.

I found this in a local DVD store for a bit pricey at about 30$, and being I never saw it took a big chance cause I don't like spending that much unless I know what im definitly gettinmg. Like I said pricey but definitly worth it. They have the cheaper regular edition here so for those who never saw it and want to take a chance get the cheap one, you may like it enough toto buy the special edition. But this movie is worth the purchase I had it for about 12 months now and have watched it numerous times very good and enjoyable one of the best slasher flicks to ever be made. IMO atleast.",1129334400,3,1839,4.2250712250712255
1427199,4,B00005IC52,"I watched this for the first time late last night after reading all the glowing reviews. I wasn't disappointed but I was terrified! Afterwards I had to go to the bathroom at around 4am and this meant I had to pass the attic...

The scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face. It's more unnerving than it is frightening and the film is paced somewhat slowly. If you prefer horror films with alot of action, you best look somewhere else. Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in bright exuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors. In this regard it reminds me very much of Dario Argento's horror masterpiece ""Suspiria"". It's a beautiful looking film. The atmosphere is also second to none and the first person view from the killer only compliments this.

There are moments where you have to suspend belief, I won't mention them as they are probable spoilers, but one I can is the cops didn't even think to check the attic out near the end. Or the rest of the house for that matter. They would inevitably have come back, but despite being certain they had the killer, they left a traumatised young woman on her own!

The director himself later admitted he would have preferred to have dropped the open ending, and I would normally tend to agree. I usually hate open ended films and would much rather know the who, what and why. However, in this film it works. You will be left thinking about it for days and I imagine it will remain in your mind alot longer than if we knew everything.

On a side note, I'm 22 now but I wish I was born in the 50s so I could have asked Olivia Hussey (Jessica Bradford) out! She looks stunning in this movie.

I can't tell you how many times I searched for this movie in bad video stores, online, etc. and kept coming up only with that Santa Claus slasher film. Finding out it was actually called Black Christmas and getting it on Amazon was thrilling but on second viewing all these years later, I have to say I was disappointed. I didn't recall knowing the killer was living in the attic so soon in the film and would have found it much scarier not to know where he was exactly until the very last scene. The obscene phonecalls are GREAT and CHILLING but confusing as his words are sometimes inaudible. I would have liked to have seen a lot more of these phonecalls and less about that annoying house mother. What I really do like about this film in retrospect, is that you never see the killer, never learn anything about him or his motives and all you're left with is knowing that a very insane, very psychotic monster with a mother complex and affection for animal noises will live in this attic a long, long time and will cause a lot more mayhem long after the credits have rolled.

Black Christmas is one of those rare slashers that puts the accent on tension and athmosphere.  There's no real blood to speak of here, rather through mood and lighting the film reaches near unbearable tension.

It's great to see some classic elements from the horror genre presented here for the first time.  The obscene phone calls coming from upstairs (later utilized to brilliant effect in When a Stranger Calls) and it looks like Halloween may have had some inspiration from this little gem. Bob Clark's direction is nothing but superb, he had the feel for the genre, most definately.  God only know why he opted to leave it completely.

1427253,1,B00005IC52,"This is one of the worst movies of any genre I've ever seen; and I've seen a lot of junk. The characters are unmotivated in their actions, not just simple stuff, like going into a room so the audience can shout ""Don't go in there!"" But police spending huge energy with a child murder loose on a obscene phone call. The father of the missing girl spending the entire movie expressionless, more interested in being a prude than a worried parent, only to faint (off camera!) at some unmotivated, forgettable remark.

The ending was ludicrous, totally disappointing and incomprehensibly unsatisfying. The direction was awful, from camera angles that spend time on people's backs, to horrific action that happens OFFSTAGE and thus, completely UNterrifying. The acting was mostly bad but for Andrea Martin, and the script was pure, unadulterated junk. It was badly structured, badly paced (director and/or writer can share blame), ludicrously undermotivated (people did things not because that's what their character would do, but becasue the script said to) and bafflingly bad. Why was this movie even made with a script so completely awful and lacking in craft?

The answer can be that this waste of film stock was obviously an attempt by Canada to launch a fledgling movie industry and was thus bankable first, and good last. Teen horror movies then, and now, were sure fire money makers, even if they were terrible and shamefully lacking in craft as this one was. Even the off cmaera Sound FX track was not only irritating, but senseless. The howling wind inside the sorority made as little sense as possible.

And Peter was totally without organic motivation. He was a right to lifer with passion and stupidly unrealistic sobbing because he was a piano player? If that was important, then why not make him a medical student commited to saving life, all life? His concert studies were completely unrelated to the rest of the movie. And he was such a chauvinistic pig that he stretched credulity to the breaking point. And made Hussey's character look moronic.

As a side note, while the idea of a killer creeping around and into the sanctuary of a college sorority in '74 was a good idea, why not make the sorority a reasonable victim of it's own imaturity, or past errors of judgement, or something organic?

Without any reason, then the entire foundation is viable only in a cinematic environment where people don't have to behave with any reason. Yes, yes. I know. Killers who slaughter young girls aren't reasonable. But if the young girls had done something to provoke him, the story would have been tighter and more plausible and therefore, more frightening to the audience. (Don't make fun of the wierd guy, he could come back and kill you and all your friends.) Bah. Humbug. Pure, unadulterated *&^*&^.

I don't want to insult anyone here, but the preponderance of reviews in the positive are a total mystery to me. I would recommend this movie only to people I detest or anyone with insomnia. These people should have been prevented from any further attempts at mass entertainment as they have demonstrated neither the craft or imagination to attempt it.",1119139200,7,3161,4.899065420560747

1427258,5,B00005IC52,"""...it's on to tight.""  Just seeing this movie for the first time in a few years, it still gave me the willies.  The thing that makes this movie so scary is probably the atmosphere.  The amount of creepy atmosphere in this movie is staggering.  This actually felt like it could really happen.  Many believe Halloween to be the first slasher.  I consider this to be, as it is just as good as Halloween.  This movie even has many similarities to Halloween, and was made four years before.  Oh, and the ""killer in the house thing"" was first done in Black Christmas, not When a Stranger Calls.  Halloween and When a Stranger Calls owe a lot to this movie (and so does basically every other slasher).

  This movie is one of the scariest ever made, in my opinion.  The bleak winter atmosphere helps.  The killer POV shots are very scary (especially when the killer toys with his victims).  Oh, I also have to mention the phone calls.  The phone calls in this movie are the scariest phone calls ever (even better than the phone calls in When a Stranger Calls, even though those are pretty scary too).  You hear the killer take on different voices, such as a woman, baby, pig, etc.  The killer also learns frightening facts about the sorority girls and says them on the phone (very scary considering he's only upstairs in the attic).  The killer is one of the most maniacal I've ever seen.  The way he kills his victims (low on gore, high on brutality) and sets them up is downright creepy (the girl with the plastic on her head in the chair brrrr).  This movie also has a good blend of comedy, drama, and horror.  The comedy and drama aspects help you to feel for the characters, making their deaths more shocking.  Also, the very scary eyeball shot (you will know when you see it, trust me) is terrifying!  I also liked the ending, even though many people don't.  Not knowing about the killer makes him that more frightening.  If we found out his background info, and such, he wouldn't be as scary.  This isn't a type of killer like Michael Myers and Jason, who need a reason to kill.  The killer in BC doesn't need a reason to kill because he is like a real-life killer.  Real-life killers never have a motive to kill, you'll just hear about them walking into someone's house and stabbing them, and stuff like that.  This makes the killer seem more real, therefore making it feel this could really happen.  Anyway, this is the first (and best) slasher of all time.  It's also one of the best and scariest horror movies of all time.  Any horror fan who hasn't seen this movie yet (many people haven't ever heard of it), owes it to themseleves to check out this forgotten, criminally underrated flick.",1111795200,3,2695,4.513457556935818

It was on HBO the first night I saw it. I was babysitting my youngest brother, had all the lights turned out...when I noticed a flash of light upstairs, by the attic. Needless to say, my heart raced faster than a formula one car and found a baseball bat to clobber my would be attacker. I went upstairs slowly and as I got closer to the attic, the hall light flashed on again, scaring the everliving s**t out of me. When my parents came home, I found out that my Dad had put a new light switch in...the kind that flashes when it isn't completely shut off.

I was eighteen at the time and had never been that scared (before or since). The reason was because the movie made you think that it could happen. I still get the creeps thinking about that movie. Now that I have found this movie again, I'm not even sure I want to see it. It has stayed with me this long (I'm 44, at the time of this writing).

So if you truly want a scary movie, then this is the one to get.

1427285,5,B00005IC52,"In the late 1970's(about the time the first Superman movie came out), I remember watching a movie on HBO called, 'Stranger in the House' with Margot Kidder.  For years I tried to find that movie on video or dvd without any luck.  A few months ago I was surfing the Amazon web site and read several positive reviews of a movie called 'Black Christmas' starring Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder.  I began reading the description and was amazed by the similarities. My search was over.  This was indeed the same movie....but why did I remember it under another name?

I immediately ordered the special edition of the movie.  Mystery solved!  The special features included two alternate openings; one showing the movie as I remember it with the 'Stranger In The House' title, as well as another one showing a third title, 'Silent Night, Evil Night.' It has a really great featurette on the making of the movie, but still no explanation as to why three different titles were used.[If anyone knows the answer to this, please email me with it.]

Let me give you a scenario to help describe how scary this movie is.  I remember going to my mother the night I watched it and asking her if the attic in our house was large enough for someone be in. Thankfully, it wasn't. She even had my father get a ladder and show me that the inside of our attic was barely tall enough for anyone to stand in, just so I could sleep that night.  Of course, I was only eight or nine years old at the time.  However, I'm now 35 now and it still gave me the creeps!  Needless to say, I was not disappointed, nor will you be!  The fact that you never actually see the killer makes it even more terrifying and mysterious.  I wish newer horror movies would go back to this technique of 'using the camera as the killer.'Also, this movie has some of the most creative death scenes I have seen to this day.(Remember, the house mother peaking into the attic?)

I highly recommend the Special Edition for true horror movie collectors, even though the sound quality is poor on portions of the featurette.  Still, it was really interesting to be given a tour of the infamous house 30 years later.",1101600000,6,2157,4.492307692307692

To a man or woman the response is the same - ""it scared the hell out of me"".

  Its' hard to believe that Bob Clark made this film as well as the Porky's trilogy- but hey, comedy and horror both take talent.

  Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth, Nightmare on Elmstreet,et al, all copy elements contained in this truly frightening film.

  It takes place at a off-campus house over Christmas break. It involves a group of young college women who, unbeknownst to them, have a visitor. That's all I'll say. I've never forgotten this film.

  Even after buying the DVD (and its' great with lots of extras), and having Bob Clark explain exactly how he made this film, it still scares me. Hardly any blood or gore -just incredibly imaginative, intense, film making. Just try watching it alone.

  As the saying goes ""you won't sleep through it"", in fact you might have a hard time ever sleeping again, at least if you're sleeping in a house... with a large attic in it.

I just got down watching this obscure little film and i give it merit for contributing to the horror genre and starting it off but as far as this being good or scary i disagree. Alot on this site are saying its the best horror film and the scariest. Its not. They are saying don't watch it with the lights off- the calls made by the killer were freaky but they wernt scary to me. The story revolves around a sorority house and a killer hiding in the house killing each girl off one by one , he is making obsene and crazy phone calls from the upstairs attic without the girls knowing hes in the house. The killings didn't scare me or surpise me. There was little gore and the killers face is never shown , only his eye so we don't know who the killer is, even at the end. We are led to beleive its the boyfriend at first but at the end it is obvious it isnt. John Saxon (nightmare on elm street) plays the detective trying to trace the calls and investigate and find out who the killer is. The end of the film the cops don't even search the attic and the killer is still there. Never even get to know who did it. The only half likeable characters in the film are the detective and olivia hussey. She sounds foreign and the voice can get annoying. But other than that this is a so so film, maybe it was good for its time but texas chainsaw massacre and psycho outdo this. Ive seen better.

1427303,4,B00005IC52,"Director:  Bob Clark
Cast:  Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon.
Running Time:  98 minutes.
Rated R for violence and profanity, yet by today's horror standards would more likely fall into the PG-13 category.
Seemingly a forgotten horror tale due to the over-publicized ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Exorcist"", the brilliance of ""Halloween"", and the development of the summer blockbuster (""Jaws""), this thrill-a-minute chiller is just as original as any horror/slasher film ever made.
The basic premise of the film revolves around a sorority house/college dormatory that is mysteriously being tormented by an obscene phone caller.  At first, the girls think that the guy is just a prank caller and will eventually goes away, but dead bodies start to turn up.  Olivia Hussey stars as the main female squeeze, who suspects that the killer may be her boyfriend Dullea, who has been acting stranger and stranger throughout the events.  John Saxon is good as the police detective investigating the abnormal case, while Margot Kidder (who would later play Lois Lane in the 1978 action classic ""Superman"") is excellent as the profane, alcohlic college girl who is stricken with asthma.
""Black Christmas"" is shot brilliantly by director Bob Clark, using many elements of foreshadowing and using a fine musical score to add to the tension.  The first half of the film slightly drags, but the finale is superb as Hussey confronts the evil stalker.  A must-see for those who respect the horror genre and are fans of the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.  Does not receive the praise or recognition it deserves; ""Black Christmas"" is a superb suspense piece.",1085443200,4,1675,5.174074074074074
1427304,5,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas is a movie about a killer who hides in the attic of a sorority house on Christmas and kills people one by one in typical slasher horror movie style.  Besides the fact that Black Christmas was one of the first slasher movies and set the standard for the rest, you might ask yourself why Black Christmas is even worth a viewing.  There are two reasons in particular.  First, everything that happens in the movie is completely realistic.  The killer is not invincible like Freddy or Jason, he is just well-hidden.  We are spared the usual ""wait, he was shot, stabbed, and thrown from a window, how can he still be alive?"".  When sisters begin disappearing, there is a completely logical explanation (""she went to meet her father, remember?"" or ""she must have left for home a few hours earlier than she had told us"").  Second, there is a large amount of mystery surrounding the events of the movie, which makes it seem that much more realistic.  The killer is never revealed, and the baby of which the killer speaks in some of his obscene phone calls is never explained.  Black Christmas comes highly reccommended, especially if you are sick of the typical slasher fare.",1085184000,2,1182,4.699029126213592
1427305,5,B00005IC52,"The first time I saw this movie was in the 80's.  I had already been subjected to Freddy, Jason and Michael, and this scared me more than the three of them combined.  Don't get me wrong, Nightmare, Friday and Halloween were, and still are, very scary movies.  I went into it expecting the worst and came out of it wanting to go back to a time before I had witnessed it.  It scared me soooo bad that I had to sleep with the lights on for weeks afterwards.  Every time the phone rang I sank inside from fear.
Now I am older, wiser and more mature......... I am no longer a teen as I was when I watched this the first time.  I have been subjected to things much worse and more horrifying over the past 20 years...........  or so I thought......
I thought that the padding of time and the advancements of movies and cinema would cushion me.....
I was wrong.
I watched this movie again with some friends who had not seen it, yet alone even heard of it.
I watched in horror as every feeling came rushing back.  I watched in amusement as my friends lost every ounce of cool.  I watched in sheer delight as I witnessed, once again, one of the most terrifying movies ever made tear me and my friends to shreds of useless nothing.  Even with all the camp that is now visible in the movie, it does not let loose of its horrifying grip.
The premise is that there is a killer loose.  It appears that he has chosen the attic of the sorrority house to hold up in.  He uses the phone to do some of his or her terrorizing.  One by one the sorrority sisters and housemother are picked off.  And one by one the list of suspects grows until the climax at the end when everything is solved... or is it?
I could go on about the plot, but others have already done so.
If you watch this with the knowledge that this is one of the originals, not a knock off, then you will have more appreciation for it.
Sure, the acting is questionable, as is the directing, camera work and editing.
But, this is the real deal..  this is what other movies have molded themselves after.  This is the movie that deserves all the credit that others get.
Watch this and see if you feel the same way about unicorns that you did before you saw it.

1427306,4,B00005IC52,"Ever wondered where films such as Friday the 13th, Scream, and all those obnoxious late night horrors got their ideas? Specifically the hidden, knife weilding psychos. Black Christmas is the correct 2-word answer.
It starts when a person (seen from his POV) sneaks into a sorority house. When I first heard this I thought of the slasher/cheerleader/sorority house movies (very bad) and cringed. But Black Christmas turned out to be anything but.
Black Christmas made no big splash when it first came out, but now a days its considered a significant part of horror cinematic history, because more than a few big time horror flicks have used some of the fear inducing elements of this film. When me and my boyfriend watched it we kept saying, ""Oh I recognize that!"" and it was very fun to see the untamed original form of some of these devices.
The film lets you get to know the characters though (unlike modern slasher flicks)  - from the pregnant Jess who is considering abortion, to the foul mouthed, alcoholic sorority matron. Quite a few interesting characters live in this sorority house. And then BAMN, they begin to get killed off, with the viewer rarely expecting the next victim,
A LIL SOILER ALERT
Black Christmas is one of the first ""mainstream"" slasher films. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" came out the same year, but awhile before both came Mario Brava's ""Reazione A Catenea"". This was (debatably) the first slasher movie, and the friday the 13th series was based upon it. Black Christmas adds a depth of mystery - you never do find out who the killer is, or what his motives are. For some viewers this adds freakiness. Unlike newer slasher movies, where at the end the killer is revealed (and usually) dealt with.
Remember those movies with the stranger calling and uttering obscene things into the phone with a dangerous altered voice? That part is a direct take off from Black Christmas - the first (horror) movie to use the phone as a method of terrorization. Part of the horror of the film is included in the strange phone calls. Just when you think everything is safe.... the phone rings. In the DVD version I've seen, some of the obscenities and lewdness of the calls are edited out (compared to the version I saw a long time ago). I've read on numerous websites that this was to make the film ""less offending"".
Overall, it's an enjoyable watch. While it isn't superbly good and unsurpassable, its great to see the foundations of modern slashers. Be prepared for something a bit more serious and with a more refined style than your usual slasher. I only wish the ending had been more.... realistic. I never did understand why the police didn't search the attic....",1077062400,,2683,4.769892473118279

A creepy pervert keeps calling their sorority house, making threats and odd noises. The house is getting ready to empty out for the holidays with a big christmas bash. The phone-freak calls again, right after we see a man climb a trellis and slip into an attic window. Barb yells at him and says some choice words of her own. This offends one of the other girls present, who goes upstairs to pack. She is met with sudden death at the hands of the unknown psycho, who now has the run of the house! Bob Clark (Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things) has directed a tense, terrifying, should-be classic here! Keir Delea (2001: A Space Odyssey / Bunny Lake Is Missing) is excellent as the driven, possibly unbalanced boyfriend of Jess. They've just had a big fight over her desire to get an abortion. Has this got anything to do with the horrors that await our sorority sisters, or just another red herring? Margot Kidder steals every scene she's in. She's tough, obnoxious, and unafraid of anything. Barb, Jess, and Phyl (Andrea Martin) end up as the only ones staying in the house for christmas. Their house-mother has suffered an untimely demise in the attic. Of course, the girls just think she went home.

1427308,5,B00005IC52,"BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of the best of the horror genre and HALLOWEEN, although a great film itself, borrows much from this film - John Carpenter was friends with Bob Clark and even had asked Clark if he was going to do a sequel. Bob Clark, director of the excellent CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and DEATHDREAM, told Carpenter that he was not going to do a sequel, but, if he was, it would be called HALLOWEEN. Carpenter's opening is very similar in style to Clark's opening, as if the killer POV camera work and the killer lurking out of the frame. Olivia Hussey is not the virginal heroine (her character is pregnant and determined to abort the baby) and a lot of film books and reviews incorrectly identify Keir Dullea as the killer when he is obviously not. I have heard complaints regarding the ending and the unknown identity of the killer because most viewers have been conditioned to have everything explained to them & tied up in a neat little package, a la the ending of PSYCHO, but that only makes the film more unique. It was one of the first and the acting is superb for this type of effort. In a fair world it would be every bit as popular as HALLOWEEN, but given the amount of posts for this film, it shows that BLACK CHRISTMAS is very much appreciated by horror fans. I read an interview with Bob Clark on FANGORIA'S web site that a remake of BLACK CHRISTMAS is in the works, as well as a remake of DEATHDREAM and either a remake or sequel to CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. Another great Bob Clark film worth checking out is MURDER BY DECREE, in which Sherlock Holmes takes on the Jack the Ripper slayings. It's a shame that Clark turned his back on the horror genre after BLACK CHRISTMAS and directed crap like the PORKY'S movies and LOOSE CANNONS.

There's plot and story going on around the killings.  Many people found this boring, but to me it's realistic.  The phone tracing, the neighborhood watch, it all made it seem real.  What else?

1427310,5,B00005IC52,"This 1974 Canadian flick is one of the creepiest you'll ever see. Bob Clark (Porky's) directed this early slasher with much skill and a bit of humor. The setting is a Canadian sorrority house, a couple of days before Christmas.  Since everyone is going home for vacation, no one is suspicious when the students disappear. The stalker/obscene phone caller's voice is chilling. There is a lot of suspence and very little blood in the attack scenes.

Many films ""borrowed"" from Black Christmas, most blatantly ""When a Stranger Calls"".  But over the years, thanks to cable TV and video, this cult film is gaining popularity rather quickly.

Fans of this film will want this edition of the DVD, which instantly outclasses all previous editions. It contains a lengthy new documentary, two commentaries (the first by Bob Clark), interviews, trailers, stills and posters.  It also contains a reversable cover sleave that has the original 1974 movie poster on one side (containing the movie's most famous image of the first victim covered in plastic). Horror fans as well as fans of good solid thrillers will be pleased.

Addition to my first review: I thought Amazonians would enjoy a little history: This film was a big hit in Canada, but was mostly ignored by American movie patrons. Warner Brothers bought the film for distribution in America, but didn't like the ambiguous ending.  Not wanting to spend money to change it, they instead decided to change the title to ""Silent Night, Evil Night"". Black Christmas seemed like a blaxploitation title akin to ""Shaft's Christmas"" according to Warner execs. The change didn't help, and Warner lost faith in the film and cut the advertising budget.  The film quietly faded away.
3 years later, NBC expressed interest in broadcasting the flick on it's Saturday Night at the Movies. At the last minute, NBC pulled the plug, deeming the movie too intense for network tv.
In the early eighties, Warner thought they might try to sell the film to cable (which was finally catching on).  HBO agreed to broadcast the film, but they didn't like EITHER of the previous two titles. They chose ""Stranger in the House"". Quite a few people saw it on cable, but those who caught Black Christmas in the 70's and wanted to see it again were not aware of the name change. They thought the movie was lost forever. A few years later, the film was edited and sold to basic cable stations like USA, still called ""Stranger in the House"".
In 1986 Warner released the film to home video for rental.  Old fans were finally reunited with the chiller, as ""Black Christmas"" was reinstated as the title (probably because the uncut print contained this title). The film gained new fans, and a cult was growing. The rental was so popular, Warner rereleased the video as a sell through for $19.99 or less in the 90's. It also hit laserdisc around this time.
In 2001, 2004 and again in 2006, Black Christmas was release to DVD in three different editions.  Each edition contains more extras, the first being the weakest.  And of course, this Christmas Day, the REMAKE of Black Christmas will hit, with the blessing of original director Bob Clark. Will it chill 21st century audiences as the original did back in the 70's?

Having seen When a Stranger calls the previous year, I could almost marry the 2 films together. The legacy about 70's horrors was it's haunting film scores. Lalo Schifrin did a brilliant job on Amityville Horror, as did John Carpenter with the Halloween movies. My memories of the film brings me back to the girl with the clingwrap plastic over her face in the rocking chair - also the hook coming through the attic door and pulling the victim up at the throat (The only scene to top this one was in Friday the 13th part 2 when, the guy does a handstand up the staircase and ol' Jason axes him between the nuts!!!!!). The attic door in our house was in the bathroom - damn I was scared to splash with the door locked. I'm hoping to get my hands on a DVD copy soon.

1427323,2,B00005IC52,"** CORRECTION: I have honestly grown to love this movie, and it goes with my other top fave movies. **

I think I was so disappointed because I was expecting too much out of the film, because it was held in such high regards. I had to watch it again for myself to appreciate it. I would changed my 2 star rating to a 4 star rating. Still, I have to leave my old review:

Am I missing out? I think I have the same DVD that everyone else has. Covers sure are decieving these days. This movie was far from ""scary as hell"". Only a short list of 70's horror is considered great, and this is not one of them. I guess I am the only one that picked up this DVD and was greatly disappointed. It got such great reviews, as you can see here, but I was the least bit scared. I actually laughed through out pretty much of the film. I must admit though, that ending was a good one. I wasn't expecting it. All in all though, if you score it cheap, like I did. I picked this baby up at a Flea-Market for $5, then the loss isn't that great. Lastly, I guess this movie is loved for its cinemegraphic style, and the boundaries it seem to break for a 70's movie. I like the vulgarity of it, also.",1067731200,2,1176,4.0
1427324,5,B00005IC52,"There are a large number of horror films relying on graphic violence and cheap thrills in order to lure in viewers such as myself, and then there are films like Bob Clark's 1974 psychological tour de force ""Black Christmas."" Foregoing hockey masked serial killers or shambling, meat eating zombies, Canadian director Clark rivets the viewer to the screen with this crackling tale about a college sorority house and a demented psychotic relentlessly hunting its denizens down. The director of this film has often moved freely amongst different film genres during his career, from bawdy comedy (Porky's) to Sherlock Holmes (Murder by Decree) to super intelligent infants (Baby Geniuses). We should all thank the horror gods that he made this film, however, because ""Black Christmas"" might just rank as one of the creepiest pictures ever made. After viewing this blockbuster, it quickly became apparent that many subsequent films cribbed shamelessly from Clark's objet d'art. If you haven't done so already, you need to hustle out and pick up a copy of this one soon.
""Black Christmas"" takes place, predictably, around the Christmas season in a sorority house at a large university. The girls at the house all have their own nasty little secrets, little vices both major and minor that eventually emerge as the evening's madness progresses. The only hint of potential trouble at the start is a weird phone call the girls get from some guy screeching and squawking like a madman, which doesn't really concern them all that much because this guy has called before. The phone call did disturb me because it is as eerie as you could possibly imagine. Subsequent phone calls, where this guy screeches out a woman's name that the film never elaborates on adds additional chills. Who is this guy and what does he want from these young women? Sorority sister Claire is the first girl to go missing, causing her father to arrive on the scene and setting into motion a chain of events that rapidly claims the lives of several principal characters. The cops enter into the picture, and soon place a tap on that pesky phone in an effort to understand what's going on at the house. You can take it from here, but I will say the best thing about watching this movie on a DVD is that it lays to rest once and for all who it is making those crazy phone calls. If you have a pause or slow button on your remote, you can see the murderer's face. Moreover, the disc provides information about an alternate ending that leaves no doubt as to the killer's identity. The sound of a ringing phone over the closing credits was a nice touch.
""Black Christmas"" does an excellent job establishing its characters. The primary sorority girl is Jessica Bradford, played by the delightfully beautiful Olivia Hussey, who soon reveals an unfortunate secret involving her temperamental yet musically gifted boyfriend Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea). Jessica's sorority sisters consist of Barb, a wonderfully foul-mouthed alcoholic played by Margot Kidder at the height of her beauty and SCTV member Andrea Martin as the homely looking Phyllis, a no nonsense young lady who can put even the obnoxious Barb in her place with a mere word. The sorority house also has a landlady of sorts, Mrs. MacHenry, a closet drinker with a flip attitude. John Saxon makes an eventual appearance as a cop, and Art Hindle appears as the boyfriend of quickly disappearing sorority sister Claire. There are quite a few recognizable faces in this film, which gives the movie a sort of instant familiarity. All of the actors do a great job here, with Kidder and the lady who plays MacHenry turning in the best performances. Clark works wonders with this stellar cast, often illuminating a specific character trait by relying upon a quick look or a single word. Watch the scene where a drunken Barb receives a brow beating from Phyllis as proof of the director's ability to sketch out his characters.
What I appreciated most about ""Black Christmas"" was the pervasive atmosphere of impending doom wending its way through the film. Six years before Stanley Kubrick used extended camera shots of the creepy interior of the Overlook Hotel in ""The Shining,"" Clark accomplished the same effect in ""Black Christmas."" Those lingering shots of the empty hallways and staircases inside the sorority house instill a deeply disturbing sense that something ominous is just around the corner. Moreover, Clark made his film about as bloodless as possible, a rare occurrence in what is essentially a stalk and slash picture. Murders rarely appear in gory detail, but instead show up through quick editing cuts and by implication. Perhaps a rather tame film in terms of gore and an effort to slow down the pace in order to increase the suspense might not appeal to many modern horror fans, but I will take a film like ""Black Christmas"" over your typical slasher movie any day.
There are two DVD versions of this film floating around on the market right now, and unfortunately I watched the one with little in the way of extras. Make sure to look for the one with commentary tracks from Clark and Saxon on it. ""Black Christmas"" is a classic, although generally forgotten, horror film that belongs in the collection of every serious fan of the cinematic macabre. Besides, even if you don't appreciate the film, you can still learn the proper way to give a cop your new telephone area code!",1067385600,5,5404,4.868621064060804
1427325,3,B00005IC52,"Even though this film doesn't even come close to ""Halloween"", it was the original POV (point of view) hand-held camera stalker movie... you know.... where the camera acts like it is the eyes of the killer.
Anyway the plot is pretty much your run-of-the-mill deranged serial killer on the loose stalking girls in a university sorority house type horror movie, but it does boast some inventive camera shots, lighting and scares. Even though the film does not have the same kind of impact now, it was certainly a very frightening movie for its time.
A girl from the sorority house goes missing, a killer moves into the attic upstairs, strange phone calls are made to the house, a child is found murdered in the park and one of the girls has strange thoughts about an abortion as her boyfriend pianist begins to loose his mind.
The acting is pretty tacky but you will find actors like Keir Dullea (2001: A space Odyssey) playing a lead role in this movie. There are also a few other actors who went on to do better things - Margot Kidder (Superman) and John Saxon (Nightmare on Elm Street).
Overall there are a lot worse ""slasher"" movies out there but there are also a lot of better ones. Anyhow, you might as well see the original POV ""slasher"" movie if you haven't already. It is not that bad ... but it is not that good either. Sort of middle-ground horror hokum.",1066089600,,1362,4.540650406504065
1427326,3,B00005IC52,"For its time, Black Christmas would have been a highly original and frightening experience. This 1974 slasher film was indeed quite creepy, but I found some scenes were always going on forever. Olivia Hussey's performance was fair, but it was Margot Kidder who brought this film a very high quality. The unknown killer is very disturbing, always saying his name is Billy and calling out for a person named Agnes. Overall, this film was pretty scary, but even if it was the first of its kind, it wasn't the best film ever made. Pretty good I guess.",1065916800,,547,4.649484536082475
1427327,5,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas is without a doubt the greatest horror film you've probably never seen. I hadn't heard anything about it myself until I noticed it cropping up on a lot of people's favourite horror film lists, so decided it was about time I saw what all the fuss was about. The film centres around a Sorority house in the Christmas holiday season, where the girls begin receiving a series of disturbing phone calls from an unknown source. It soon becomes apparent that a faceless killer is stalking them, a killer who has snuck in through an open window and is inhabiting their attic... Pre-dating all of the classic horror films of the late 70s and 80s, Black Christmas is a stark, stylish and creepy film that boasts some chilling moments and some great performances. The genius of the film lies in it's ability to evoke an intense atmosphere of forboding which leaves you constantly unsettled and totally immersed which it does without the need for special effects, gore, or cheap scares. The direction, framing, POV shots, and lighting all work toegther seemlessly to provide moments that really leave you cold (especially the eye through the crack of the door). The script deserves a mention too, because it really is superb. There are some great characters, some good threads of drama and even comedy, but these are brilliantly and appropriately contained within their scenes without detracting from the menacing atmosphere and overall theme of the film. The phone calls are one of the high points, containing shades of Reagan's multi-voice outbursts in the Exorcist but with overtones of despair and confusion which give an insight into the psychological state of the deranged killer. All in all, if you are a fan of horror, and looking for something more than the slick disposable dime a dozen slasher films of recent years, you simply have to own this little gem.",1062720000,4,1871,4.905362776025236
1427328,5,B00005IC52,"This is one of those movies that I remembered from a sneaky late night, parents are asleep, stay up past bedtime, then regret that for the next month when you jump every time the phone rings.  I had always remembered that this was a terrifying film but did not remember the title,  so was very happy when I finally redicovered it.  Although we have seen many imitators of this little canadian film it still holds its own.  Set in a partially deserted sorority house right before christmass the film moves smoothly from one scene of suspense, a person POSSIBLY sneaking into the house, to relaxing scenes of the girls leaving for winter vacation.  This in turn is the reason why, as some girls are getting attacked their dissappearences are not noticed.  The director manages to keep suspense at nail-biting tension.  The psycho is not seen, as in Nightmare on Elm Street, where Freddy became more of a Shekky Green spouting one liners, nor as in Hallowwen where Michael Myers became an unkillable otherwordly demon.  This person is human, and all the more frightening for that reason.  AS the movie builds towards the climax with the still unsuspecting, last women in the house, you get to hear the famous line, probably the first time it was ever used in a teen horror movie.......The CAlls are coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE!  This is the origional, before these movies became targets for camp or self paradies.  Watch it with the lights on!

i still like it and it still dose raise some hairs on my head. the phone calls added so much to this film. the murders were pretty decent. the killer is pretty cool. the voices he dose are pretty creepy. they didn't go gore crazy which is a plus when it comes to what i like about horror movies. this movie was made to give you the creeps and it did what it said it would do in the trailer.
if your into good scares? this ones for you! if your into total needles gore? then look elswhere. I gave this movie 4 stars for a few reasons. the director tries to scare you instead of trying to make you puke.

I didn't realize that this film basically started the whole genre, pre-dating much of the well-known horror ""There's a killer on the loose"" classics. This movie will get under your skin, primarily due to all those psychotic phone calls. After having watched it, I can easily say that no other film of this type has left such a creepy impression on me. I wouldn't watch this film at night before going to bed, nightmares would be a given.
Mind you, if you need blood and guts a'plenty, slashin' to and fro, then this movie may not be the one for you. Still, the insane, madman psycho in this will make you want to sleep with the lights on for a few weeks and double lock your doors. The film moves along well, with not a high count of murders occurring that frequently either. But those crazy phone calls just keep on coming. All the more to set you on your very last nerve. You'll be very surprised by the ending, it left me with  just one question - what ever happened to Claude the cat??
  The picture and sound quality is excellent on this DVD version and comes with a special features section. However, the documentary with two stars from the film gets a little too silly if you ask me. Also included is commentary from director Bob Clark and actor John Saxon, but it is pretty much a rehash of what's already been spoken of in the documentary.

The DVD also features Interviews, Alternate credit openings, Trailers, TV spots, Radio spots, Still gallery, etc... There are two full-length commentaries, the first is with director Bob Clark and the second is with actors John Saxon and Keir Dullea. Both commentaries provide some interesting tidbits.

There is also a hidden easter egg which allows you to pop the disc into a DVD-ROM drive and access the bonus full script and various press releases. I won't give away exactly how you can find the easter egg, but it's not very difficult to locate!

And phone-answering plays a pretty important part in this movie. Black Christmas was the very first slasher film, made all the way back in 1974. While it may not be the precise blueprint for all subsequent slasher movies to follow ( Halloween comes closer to this. It had a chain of sequels, too, which is an important part of any slasher movie franchise ). Black Christmas, while it may not be terrifying, is a neat, tight little gem. Its game is mainly suspense, with only a few smears of blood to scare us with otherwise... and those obscene telephone calls the girls keep getting. If you like horror movies, check Black Christmas out. I think it's telling when almost everyone who remembers this movie remembers it fondly... and with goosebumps rippling up and down their arms.

Or are they? They are menaced by some of the most terrifying and bizarre phone calls I've ever heard in this type of film. The atmosphere is heavy with cold and snow (you can FEEL it) and even the Christmas lights look forlorn and dreary. The carolers that come to bring songs are interrupted and sent home because of the news of a murder in the park behind them---further isolating the girls from the outside. But the worst is yet to come as they begin to realize how sick the caller is and that he's closer than they think. Moments of humor do not distract from or diminish the terror that engulfs the girls as well as the audience as the film builds to a crescendo and then ends on a frustrating note.

Also you can definitely see the difference between this movie (made in 1974) and a typical 80's slasher film. No T & A and not much gore but it takes nothing away from the movie at all.

DVD EVALUATION:
There are 2 DVD's floating around.  The first one is the 25th ANNIVERSARY Copy which boasts a digitally remastered print.  The film was never shot in widescreen so you get it in full screen. The 25th Anniversary only contains mono soundtrack, but features wise, includes two interviews with John Saxton, and a theatrical trailer.
The second DVD available is the SPECIAL EDITION which came out in late 2002.  The picture quality has been further improved on the 25th Anniversary copy, but is only a marginal difference.  However, they have tried to make it look widescreen by chopping the top and bottom off of the original film and putting black bars. This gives the impression of widescreen, but as mentioned above, the film was originally shot full screen.  The Special Edition boasts a documentary, more interviews, a theatrical trailer, better sound ... and much more.
So which copy to get?  If you are a die-hard fan of the film, it's wise to get the 25th ANNIVERSARY copy because you get the full uncropped image of the film.  Sure, all the extras features on the new SPECIAL EDITION are a  bonus, but you can probably live without them.  Like most DVD extras, they often only get looked at once or twice ....",1021075200,6,1500,4.775193798449612
1427372,5,B00005IC52,"I'm old enough to remember when Black Christmas first came out in 1974. It caused quite a stir with the young people. As a child then....I'm 34 now....I'd heard about it's shocking elements like this chiller's  scene where the housemother is pulled off a ladder by a hook and rope that lifts her out of the view of the audience never to be seen alive again or when the murdered child is found in the park by the search party. As a fan of well made horror films,I'm very surprised that this went out of print because it is an excellent chiller that puts films like Scream and it's sequels to shame. Until I found this classic for sale on Amazon. Com(I spent several years trying to find it)...searching for it in videostores was a lost cause. This like Psycho and the original Halloween is a groundbreaking film in the madkiller genre. Ironically enough I found this gem shortly before this last Xmas and although I'd never seen it,but I'd long heard about it's very effective elements and plot that have been overused by other horror films with a great degree of nonsuccess. I had never seen this film but had heard about it for so long that I felt it was a lucrative investment. When it came and I finally watched this film I knew that I'd made a winning choice. As I watched this movie from 1974,I kept saying to myself""I've never seen anything like this movie!""It has long been out of print and overlooked by too many people because the folk that love a good fright film would love this classic. This movie was made in Canada by Bob Clark and it stars Olivia Hussey,Keir Dullea,Margot Kidder and John Saxon. How ironic that Bob Clark would make the ultimate Xmas chiller(the killer isn't dressed as Santa Claus as or any other holiday character for that matter) would also go on to make a classic Xmas family film called A Christmas Story....that's versatility! By the way,this is scary movie and it still has all it's power in 2002!",1019606400,2,1936,4.531428571428571
1427383,4,B00005IC52,"Directed by Bob Clark of ""Porky's"" fame this 1974 horror-tale take's place in a girl's sorority house during a bitter winter pre-christmas setting filmed independetly in Canada.
Series of bizarre obscene phone-call's and numerous slaying's make this watchable taught suspense-thriller a joy given an excellent ensemble cast of Margot Kidder(scene stealing) foul-mouthed drunk,Keir Dullea as an unhinged pianist boyfriend to lead heroine Jess(Olivia Hussey).
Rounding out the player's are Andrea Martin as a sorority-sister and John Saxon as the detective-cop following the trail of murder's and traces of the call's to the house.
Finale still leave's one guessing was it Peter or the crazed individual still remaining in the attic.
Mrs. Mack the house-mother is hysterical and deserved of mention.
A very good movie given reasonable transfer to DVD, color's and cleaner picture far imroved over the VHS tape's. Include's a trailer and cast bio's with oddly about only five-min interview with John Saxon.
Unfortunately isn't presented in widescreen but a remastering for sharper picture and re-mixed sound could've elevated this film to much deserved higher standard.

1427384,4,B00005IC52,"A madman sneaks into a seriority house and terrorizes the people inside.
Great movie! I heard this movie was one of the movies to first use the ""The call is coming from inside the house"" bit; if it did, the movie's filmmakers pulled it off the bit brilliantly.
What I really liked about the movie was that the audience was prevented from seeing the killer's face; this left the audience guessing as to who the killer really was. In one scene, the camera is in front of the killer, but the killer's face is hidden in the dark; the only thing we really get a good look on are the killer's eyes (we would later see these eyes again later in the movie).
Probably the best part about this movie is the ending. The ending kind of makes you want a sequel.",1018656000,,748,4.274647887323944
1427385,2,B00005IC52,"Black Christmas is another one of those movies that seems to have gained a reputation of being better than it actually is.
At a certain holiday (I won't spoil it for you) a group of sorority sisters is killed off one-by-one by a maniac who calls and breaths heavily into the phone.  Both Halloween and When a Stranger Calls took elements from this movie.  I'd rank this movie somewhere above Stranger and well below Halloween.
The one thing that separates Black Christmas from all the slashers that followed Halloween is the fact that these girls have a lot of depth.  They are not just given problems for the sake of having something to talk about.  The problems actually build character and figure into the main story.
The murders (the benchmark of all slasher movies) are creative if not suspenseful.  And the killer has as good a reason as any other I've heard for killing in these movies.
The Canadian DVD apparently has some things that the U.S. DVD doesn't, so if you really like the movie and want to make the extra effort try to find it instead.
Mildly recommended for historical value and Margot Kidder's performance.",1018483200,4,1127,4.700507614213198
1427386,5,B00005IC52,"I got this video a week ago and this is the best horror movie I have seen in a while.  The bizarre telefone calls are frightening.  There is great acting especially by Olivia Hussey as the heroine and a great performance by Margot Kidder. The movie is about a sorority house that is getting chilling phone calls from a crazy psycho. The killer goes bolistic and kills sorority sisters one by one. The prime suspect is Jesse's (Olivia Hussey)boyfriend Peter. Is Peter the killer? Little do the sorority sisters know that the killer is right above them in their attic. The movie might drag the plot a little but that will be made up for its great and creepy ending. This movie came out before Halloween by 4 years.  This is a movie that will make you stay up all night.  This maybe a hard movie to get, but when you finally get it, it was worth the wait.  Bob Clark did a great job setting the frightning mood in the story. Black Christmas is one of the best horror films in a while and they don't seem to make them like this anymore.",1017446400,,1032,4.298969072164948
1427387,4,B00005IC52,"I've been watching horror flicks since I could form whole sentences, so nothing really surprises me anymore. Where others are cowering behind couches and covering their eyes, I'm like, ""Please, that isn't even remotely scary."" Well, if I were to show ""Black Christmas"" to those fools, they'd probably die outright of fright.  I finally saw it last year, and let me tell you, that was the first time in my life I actually looked into the closet to make sure no one was hiding behind the door.
The plot in a nutshell goes like this: a sorority house is emptying as Christmas break approaches.  A few sisters are staying a few extra days.  Little do they know, someone has climbed into the attic (someone clearly warped and insane), and begins to pick them off one by one.  Oh, and he makes threatening phone class (scary as heck) to them before he kills them.  Not until there's only one girl left are the calls traced to the room upstairs.  If you're thinking this is all pretty standard so far, remember this: BLACK CHRISTMAS was made a full four years before HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.  While HALLOWEEN is probably the more exciting of the two, BLACK CHRISTMAS is the scarier one, and pretty much set the stage and the standard for the all the clones that would follow.  It's chills and frights are not based on BOO! moments but escalating dread and and oppressive atmosphere.  The cast does pretty well:  Olivia Hussey as the kind but tough heroine, Margot Kidder as the foulmouthed alcoholic in the house, Andrea Martin as the wry but vulnerable sister. And you just don't find endings like this one in recent slasher pics.  SCREAM, while entertaining, is not about true fear. BLACK CHRISTMAS is.
Bottom line: This movie isn't perfect, but it comes close. It knows exactly how to scare: by focusing on what we don't see, by imagining what is happening just beyond our line of sight.  And that's a hundred times scarier than a lame killer in a ghostface mask and a cell phone who trips every time he chases someone.  There's no ""cutesy"" horror in BLACK CHRISTMAS.  See SCREAM/URBAN LEGEND/I KNOW WHAT YOU DID/etc. for that vapid stuff.",1017273600,4,2147,4.675531914893617
1427388,5,B00005IC52,"I am an extreme horror collector.  I have been viewing, collecting, and building my 20 best horror films of all time.  Well, after finally locating this masterpiece after many years I have finally found my number one.  To all of you doubters, understand what this first and best slasher move has to offer...
1.  The all-time scariest maniac, ""Billy"" -- Just because he is so freaky and unpredictable.  He runs instead of walking, knocks stuff over, uses several weapons, talks to his prey, plays with his dead prey, tells his prey what he is going to do to them, has at least three personalities, goes into rages, and sings songs.  Top that Jason or Freddy.
2.  Now familiar settings that just seem fresh.  I know that its hard to believe that a frat house could ever be fresh, but it is in this movie.  Amazing!
3.  Comedy!  Yes, all great horror movies need to have at least a little comedy in them.  And B.C. has it fair share.  Not too much but enough for you to let your guard down.
4.  Intensity.  When the killer ""Billy"" stalks a victim, you feel like you are being chased also.  You can see kills coming but they still make you jump.
5.  Last but not least - One killer eye scene that will make you scream like a little girl!
I just can't go on enough about this film.  It has everything.  You have to see this movie to understand how many other films have ripped it off.  It is so great that this masterpiece is finally getting some of the credit it deserves.  Buy it Now!!!",1016928000,7,1483,4.339416058394161
1427389,5,B00005IC52,"These ordinary mundane words will chill your blood after one viewing of ""Black Christmas"", certainly among the finest horror films ever made.
Starring Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin,
the film begins as an urban legend come to life: the old standby of the psycho stalking the college sorority house. The thing about urban legends though is that they usually stem from a grain of truth.  While this film was released way back in 1974, I believe it's still as timely as ever in our violent and  repressive society.
Inspiring a host of imitators, including horror standards such as Halloween & When a Stranger Calls, as well as lesser knowns like Don't Answer the Phone & Don't Look in the Basement, Black Christmas was one of the first to bring the terror home.  The villain stalks his prey in the one place where they feel safest - their own home.  Many viewers of my generation still shudder upon hearing that famous quote, ""He's calling from inside of the house - get out of the house!"" (When a Stranger Calls) But BC had already been there and done that in a big way.
While the film works famously on all levels for any horror audience, I think it resonates most deeply with young women who will soon be facing adulthood, and moving away from home and familiarity. This is the *ideal*  horror movie for a slumber or Halloween party.
The best recommendation I can give the film is this: It's been almost 20 years since I've set eyes on it and I'm giddy with the anticipation of seeing it again.  I could go on and on but I need to log off and clear the line - I'm expecting a phone call...",1016582400,,1605,4.47945205479452
1427390,5,B00005IC52,"Although the film looks dated,""Black Christmas"",is easily one of the most unnerving,chilling,and horrific cinematic experiences ever created. It strikes at the core of what terrifies us the most,being terrorized in our own homes or dwellings,our last refuge from the evils of the world. To add to the terror and intensity,the homicidal maniac stalking the young ladies in the sorrority has multiple personality disorder,shifting abruptly between sorrow,anger,hatred,sexual excitement,fear,and pure rage. The phone calls he makes illustrate how deep his psychosis is,it's obvious he's not recovering anytime soon,and the only way he feels he can relieve the pain is to destroy the hate object,which in this film is Women. This is the rare film that gets under your skin and stays there long after it's conclusion. I saw this on television in 1976,and it still gives me chills,i still have this intense feeling of dread with regards to attics,and i'm sure you will too after seeing this. Much has been said about Margot Kidder's performance,and although it is effective,Olivia Hussey is the real foundation to the film. As the independent,intelligent,courageous,mature young woman she's the xcellent counterpoint to the sexual repressed,immature,childlike,developmentally disabled homicidal maniac. I highly recommend this classic of the Horror/Suspense/Thriller genre,but i would also suggest waiting to see if Anchor Bay will be releasing this in a special edition with extras. From the edition details it seems the DVD only consists of the film itself.",1010275200,2,1553,5.641025641025641
