2116891,5,B0002S64E6,"The quality is so good that you will think you are watching brand new prints in the best theater on Main Street in the 1940s. Actually it's probably better than that. The intro says these digital re-masters were done by a company named ""US Television Office, Inc."". For goodness sake, every person or studio who has old prints TAKE THEM TO ""US TELEVISION OFFICE, INC."" AND GET THEM RE-MASTERED. Platinum has released 8 volumes of these Hoppy feature films and I own all 8. But for some strange reason, probably only known to some ""power lunch"" executive, they did not number the volumes...so you will just have to tell the difference by the numbers Amazon gives them. They are worth twice or 3 times the price. There were 66 Hopalong Cassidy films made starring William Boyd, and you can own 40 of them with these 8 volumes at a slim price.",1170028800,3,840,4.569536423841059
2116892,5,B0002S64E6,"Always up for movies that Bill Boyd stared in and these 5 cover a range of years; so a host of different characters, sidekicks and villains come into play. They are totally entertaining and the message they give is still important now as it was then. I highly recommend them to anyone that likes stories of the old west.",1162598400,2,320,4.440677966101695
2116893,5,B0002S64E6,"The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy ... The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ... William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment ... Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films ... a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of his films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys ... just the way we like 'em.",1162252800,,4100,5.317901234567901
2116894,5,B0002S64E6,after buying volume one I ordered this one as well and I wasn't disappointed- excellent product on every level. Strongly recommended!,1123804800,7,133,5.380952380952381
2116895,4,B0002S64E6,"Anyone who is an early western and especially a Hopalong Cassidy fan will enjoy this 5 movie treat.  California Carlson is one of the best side kicks to have ever played in the early westerns.  His comedy is unique and his is timing perfect.  Hopalong is at his best in these adventures.  Anyone who is tired of the stuff churned out on today's TV choices can relax with these movies that contain not only lots of action and horseback chases, but comedy and intrigue.  Be a kid again, or if you are still a kid discover why Hopalong Cassidy movies will always be in demand.

These movies are great for the whole family.  They contain mild violence, only the good guys win, they are funny and full of adventure.  Hoppy never drinks or smokes and provides morals and principles that we wish all kids could see and copy.  If you want good movies for your kids (or grandkids) to watch, Hopalong Cassidy should always be on top of the list.",1121126400,11,935,4.452941176470588

2116902,5,B0002S64E6,"What you have to remember is that the Paramount films from the 1930s and 40s were superb in every detail, but the earliest were already released through Image Entertainment as double features (those are also on Amazon for purchase). These are the second best, ignoring the last twelve that William Boyd produced himself, which drag and are very slooo[...] So slow in fact that when he edited them into TV features in the 1950s, they work better as 25 minute episodes. But overall, the picture quality is superb and so is the sound. These used to sell on VHS as single features at $14.95 each so five of them for a little more than a buck a piece is a bargain and worth the price. This company released eight DVDs, by the way, for a total of 40 of the 66 movies. I recommend you buy all eight of them.",1329955200,,800,4.34
2116903,5,B0002S64E6,"I have watched several of these DVD's of the Hopalong Cassidy series and have to say the quality is very good as they have been Digital Remastered in 2000, so they are quite
up to date for watching.  I don't know what I'll do when I get them all watched??  I streamed some different Hopalong Cassidy movies on Netflix with the quality acceptable but
not quite as good as these.",1327795200,,377,4.371428571428571
2116904,4,B0002S64E6,"This is a review for the second Platinum Disc collection of five
Hopalong Cassidy films.  These films were originally released between
1941 and 1948 for either Paramount Pictures or United Artists.

Here are the five films contained in this box set:

PIRATES ON HORSEBACK (1941) California Carlson. Hoppy's longtime sidekick, discovers that a relative was murdered because he wouldn't reveal the location of his hidden gold mine.  Hoppy, California and Lucky decide to investigate. With Andy Clyde, Russell Hayden, Eleanor Stewart, Morris Ankrum, Dennis Moore.

BORROWED TROUBLE (1948) Hoppy, California and Lucky are caught in the middle of a feud between two rival saloon owners and a feisty school marm. With Andy Clyde, Rand Brooks,
Anne O'Neal, Helen Chapman, John Parrish, Cliff Clark.

DANGEROUS VENTURE (1947) Hoppy and his pals have to  contend with an ancient Aztec curse as well as battle  a scheming, crooked rancher all of which cause plenty of trouble for everyone involved. With Andy Clyde, Rand Brooks, Fritz Leiber, Harry Cording, Douglas Evans, Betty Alexander.

FALSE COLORS (1943) One of Hoppy's younger cowboys is murdered after making Hoppy, California and Jimmy partners in his inherited portion of a ranch. With Andy Clyde,
Jimmy Rogers, Douglas Dumbrille, Claudia Drake, ""Bob"" Mitchum, Glenn Strange.

THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND (1946) A rugged canyon called ""The Devil's Playground"" may be the location of hidden gold as well as mayhem and murder.  With  Andy Clyde, Rand Brooks, Elaine Reilly, Robert Elliott.

So here are five more pretty straightforward western adventures starring William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy with his colorful sidekicks entertainingly played by Andy Clyde with Rand Brooks and Russell Haydon. As in the first set of Hopalong Cassidy films, these are very good video and sound quality and for the price that they are being sold
for they are quite a  bargain.  Four Stars for fun and the nostalgia factor as well as
plainn old fashioned entertainment value.",1273363200,2,2003,5.274447949526814
