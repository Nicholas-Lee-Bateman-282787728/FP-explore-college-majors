7009793,3,B00TI5RPTW,"Alien Battlefield has an arc-story background and other elements that fans of the X-Files will find familiar, and I surmise that this movie took it's ideas from there. It's obviously a shorter-length and budget version of course.  So, as a fan of X-files, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed watching this move, once.  However, as I expected, this movie has plenty of cheesy and ridiculous B-movie scenes which really cheapen it's feel, and overall the production quality I'd rate as grade C.  Both cover photo and title is downright wrongfully misleading; this movie isn't about alien battles or spaceships, but follows some behind-the-scenes players as they're trying to find the truth (sounds familiar?)",1434153600,,709,5.256637168141593

7009795,1,B00TI5RPTW,"Another attempt to make the Roswell incident into a good movie. Unfortunately, this falls flat with long, boring monologue and the chorus in the sound track sang the same notes repeatedly.  The actors didn't even interest me. The script was weak, the movie just a rerun of an old plot. I'm glad I watched this with a friend, who bought it on Amazon. He's the one who paid for this joke.",1433289600,9,386,4.436619718309859
7009796,5,B00TI5RPTW,"The special effects are AWESOME. This is a really cool Sci-Fi espionage film. This reminds me of ""Alias"". I could see this as a TV series.",1433030400,,138,4.346153846153846
7009797,2,B00TI5RPTW,"Marianna (Maria Aceves) gets a phone call about her kidnapped brother. She needs to pick up a ""package"" at the 444 marker on Route 66, which seems significant, but isn't. We discover a guy is missing from ""the base"" and a drunk (Joshua DesRoches) gets a phone call and turns into a Manchurian assassin. The ""package"" turns out to be John, you can call me Chris, (Clint Glenn Hummel) who is light on memory. We also get glimpses of a man ( Josiah D. Lee) wearing a plastic face shield with lights who goes inside people's heads and communicates with them....some people...and he also tracks GPS stuff. Michael Madsen rides around in a stretch limo using the phone, taking about the coven. There is a guy called Rook (Vince Lozano) who calls John on the phone, whomsoever phone he happens to be nearby.

The film has a number of flaws. First off it is low budget and suffers from every aspect of a low budget. I have no idea what that stuff is on the DVD cover. The acting was very bad. Maria Aceves was laughable. The direction and editing was haphazard. You get half an idea what is going on half way through the film, a full explanation at the end, almost. It wants to be a mystery yet the title could be considered a plot spoiler. The film was released originally as "" Nomad. The Beginning"" in 2013 in Japan and appears to be the first in a low budget series, one that looks like it is not going to be made unless a bunch of people buy or rent this stinker.

Now the premise behind the film is good and would appeal to Roswell conspiracy buffs had the production had just one good redeeming quality to write about other than a bunch of people traveling on the road looking for an acting school. The film takes place in New Mexico, yet Marianna drives around in a Chevy Blazer with Pennsylvania plates. What was that all about? I mean how much can a New Mexico plate cost?

1 1/2 stars

7009814,2,B00TI5RPTW,"A good screenplay is the only reason I give two stars. The director, however, put up a lot of effort to screw the script up, it seems. Incredibly lame dialogues, inept actor play and half-decent cinematography is all there is to this movie. Little logic in development, un-believable saves of main characters in all dangerous situations - all stock, no art.

Andreas Lyon is cute, granted, and acts half-convincing at times. Is it enough to justify the wasted hour and a half of my life?... Probably not.

The screen play IS good; not entirely original, but full of potential being a ""Jason Bourne vs. aliens"" kind of thing; could have been entertaining if not the low budget movie making that killed it. Hey big movie shots, anyone listening?..",1476576000,2,745,4.8125

7009854,3,B00TI5RPTW,"This production is not the lowest of the low budget so it has a few things going for it.  They have decent actors and special effects.

The lead actors are good.  I was just waiting for the characters to evolve. There were simply too many characters without a motive for doing the things that they do in this movie.  Sometimes the camera stayed on the actor's performance for too long, making it seem a little stiff or dry.  A little snip in the editing room could have helped... but it seemed they were struggling to stretch this out to 90 minutes to make a feature.

Where this movie suffers the most is from the title and the cover art, which you wouldn't think would hurt a movie.  This kind of deception is completely misleading and upsetting!  Based on the cover art, I was expecting something like Starship Troopers.  Just look at it!  Where were the action-packed battlefields?!  Where are the alien attack ships and military guys with blasters?!  That's what I wanted to see.  It was as if the makers of this movie realized that the premise of this movie had no attraction, so they outright deceived viewers with a different movie's cover art and name.

This movie should have been called something like ""Alien Mission"".  And the cover art could have been just a snapshot of the last scene in this movie, wherein you see the villain's eyes reveal that he is not human.  Simple.  It's not so hard to take a photo of a scene in the film and actually use it in the  cover art.  (Sorry to rant on this.)

The action scenes were a little lack luster.  One such scenes, an experienced agent / henchman is incapacitated by a small rock. Uhm... No!
