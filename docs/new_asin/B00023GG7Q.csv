2059508,5,B00023GG7Q,"absolutely wonderful, pity this was not sold in south africa before. from the openig scene right to the last, one is gripped. hip hop has truly come a long way. this was recorded just before the east coast/ west coast rubbish exploded. i highly recommend this dvd to hip hop fans, young and old.",1297209600,2,295,4.481481481481482
2059509,5,B00023GG7Q,"What can I say about the Show? Well I saw it in the theater when I was 20 years old, stationed in San Diego and listening to a lot of rap music. I remember being confused by the film at first because it seemed to both have zero plot and it refused to take sides in the east coast west coast bs that ruled the day. I was a fan of both coasts and in the end I resolved to just enjoy the movie as the snapshot of hip hop that it seemed to be. I remember the Wu-Tang part pretty well and it shows their impact on the world which was something I was already pretty aware of having just returned from a West Pac cruise.

Flash forward 15 years and I popped the dvd in last week for the first time since I saw it in the theater just for the heck of it. I was immediately blown away by how great it is. It's a total snapshot of hip hop circa 1995, from old school to backpack to gansta... it's all there warts and all. The Show even has plenty of footage of Biggie doing what he did best: moving the crowd.

The Show is flawed, sure, but it holds up really well and I feel that it would make an excellent Blu-Ray. This dvd is a must see for any rap fan who is curious about the era. For anyone wondering where is Tupac? My answer is who cares. I lived through his prime and he was really annoying, like an overrated s-talker, trust me.",1272758400,,1327,3.929368029739777

8021413,3,B00023GG7Q,"In a twisted society with an audience bent for real life misery and torture much like They Shoot Horses, Don't They? an emcee guides them into a world of self sacrifice for the dollar bill in ratings only to have his concept destroyed by the second season finale contestant being his own next of kin and a has been janitor. The real mystery is how such a well groomed employee such as honorable Mason is unable to find a job with his basic skills & aptitude. Stunner.",1525564800,,467,4.379310344827586
8021414,5,B00023GG7Q,"We turn our blinders on to the ugliness of this world for there is so much ugliness.  The news is a barrage of horrific tales.  The internet is infinite with fact and fiction.  Games and Apps claim our minds, throwing the white wool over our eyes to distract us, but the scars remain.  And we are angry.  We are hurt, broken, and mortified at the society that we live in today, and we want escape, an outlet to take us away.  But the golden age of television is long dead and burnt to an ugly crisp, and Reality Television is king, shedding light on corners of life that maybe are better never to be known at all.  But we got a taste for it now.

Our attention spans have shrunken down to the size of dimes, and we may only remember yesterday.  But days long ago, ugly videos have crept across the internet, showing horrific scenes of death.  In the late nineties, there was a series called, Faces of Death, and even Saddam Husseins execution was live and viral.  Some of us didn't turn away.  We watched instead as the lights went out and blood was shed, and maybe we even told ourselves that this was entertainment.  But how hard have we fallen to become primal once again, bent on other peoples misery and even their death?

The sad truth is that we are numb to misery and death.  It is no longer fiction.  It is entertainment from shows such as Scare Tactics to Ridiculousness to Law & Order True Crime.  We have a taste for it.  We need it to forget our own ugliness, our own scars and lose ourselves in the lives of others, but what if those others took their lives right before us?  Would we look away?  Would we feel something, or would we want more, maybe even believing that their death would be justified by a kind deed or promise of a better future?  But what kind of future awaits us, if we treat death as nothing but a circus act?  The road to hell is paved with good intentions, a hard lesson learned for one, who has spun death around and around like a wheel of fortune, only to have it stop on anothers fate, but in the face of death, he could not let go.  And in that sacrifice for life did our numbness break for we are not barbarians.  We are human, and we feel.  And we hate to feel for there is too much ugliness to this life, but sometimes, we need a strong dose of reality to bring us back from the brink.  And like with Disconnect and Trust comes The Show, another blunt movie to peel back the layers of society and make us question who we are.",1512777600,,2469,4.211087420042644
