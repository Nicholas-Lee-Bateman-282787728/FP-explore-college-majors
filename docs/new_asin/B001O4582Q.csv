8329461,5,B001O4582Q,"Eighty two years after ""Metropolis"", twenty years after ""1984"" and seventeen years after ""Zentropa"", this smart director brings us a powerful nightmare, a demolishing satire (which would seem to emerge from Ray Bradbury's mind) about the silenced voices of a city by a ruthless personage - Mr. TV - who patiently has waited for the day the feelings, sensations and images of the quotidian objects be removed from the collective memory with the abominable purpose to control their lives.

But as you may expect, these plans will be ruined. The transcendence of the anecdote will be surpassed for the marvelous homage to Mellies brothers, the recurrent images of Metropolis and the relentless Big brother's eye just at one side of every TV.

Filmed in glorious black and white, the film must be seen under the perspectives of a viewer of the far thirties, when the sound in the cinema was still an utopia. The employment of the iris, the excess of the required close ups and the use of the camera-eye will conform the rest of this imaginative cult movie from Latin America.

A brutal warning!",1230940800,2,1090,4.849462365591398
