8085709,1,B000BF0CES,Not at all what I would expect from a film that Quentin Tarantino directed!!! I was VERY disappointed!  A Total Waste of time! I would highly not recommend this movie even to my worst enemy!,1432166400,,190,4.428571428571429

8085711,1,B000BF0CES,"I completely agree with the previous two reviews.  If all the synopsis' are kept the same how are we meant to tell what each product contains?!  One other thing, the episode at the end of season five was 'grave DANGER', not digger.",1137628800,6,231,4.476190476190476
8085712,1,B000BF0CES,"I wish J. Hrinsin-Harris's comment had been here when I ordered. I agree completely, I was expecting a DVD of the entire series. This was to be a Christmas gift so now I get to do some more shopping.",1135209600,9,199,4.128205128205129
8085713,1,B000BF0CES,"THIS IS NOT A BOX SET OR MOVIE OF THE CBS #1 SHOW!!! If you look at the larger image of the box, you will see that it says ""Grave Digger"". ""Grave Digger"" was the last episode in Season 5 that had 2 parts. The descripition above is completely misleading and doesn't say a thing about what this really is. Hope that this helps!!",1133740800,32,326,4.109375
