6347175,4,B00J9IP7NO,"Hachiman Hikigaya is a realist. He knows that life is unfair and everyone is a liar. He has learned to deal with it: avoid people as much as possible and if necessary, ward them off with painfully cutting remarks. But after one pessimistic essay about his high school life, his teacher forces him to join the Service Club in an attempt to improve his personalty. There is only other member of the club: Yukino Yukinoshita, the schools prettiest girl, though it turns out she has plenty of problems of her own.

The humor is this series is pessimistic, wry, and pretty darn entertaining if you like that sort of thing. Hikigaya is a great character, full of down to earth pessimism and a sharp tongue. He is also fairly good at understanding people and how to deal with them, but due to his antisocial attitude, he simply uses that ability keep people away from him. This is both amusing and a little sad. Yukino is surprisingly likable despite her superior attitude. Partly because she is as pretty and as smart as she thinks she is. It can be annoying, but if it is true, why try to deny it? The other characters have their own quirks and appeal. There is the nice girl who is forced to deal with her try-to-please-everyone attitude, the nice guy who is really as nice as he seems, the guy who looks like a girl from a shojo series, and assorted others.

The series is formatted into short story arcs with a little bit of a overarching story involving a car accident. One friend I watched this with complained that nothing had happened by the end of the series and this is mostly correct. Characters' relationships evolve, but not to any major levels. Hikigaya is never cured of his attitude problem. But it is the journey that is entertaining. Plus, a second season of Snafu was recently announced, though it wasn't said when it would air. So there is more Hikigaya goodness to look forward to!",1398038400,12,1896,4.557184750733138

6347177,5,B00J9IP7NO,"SNAFU's Hachiman is definitely one of the most interesting anime/LN protagonists we've seen in a while. I think every one of us can see a part of us reflected in him, and without being too broad, he's a very engaging and competently written character. Most of us love him for his faults and I believe he will be remembered as a very standout MC in the collective unconscious of anime fans.

Our heroine Yukinon is in my opinion one of the strongest female leads I've ever seen, and it's especially surprising considering that this is a harem! (Although, to be precise, its more harem-y elements don't come into play until the second season.) She's very bold, graceful, and in a way kind of ruthless. Her no BS-approach to the series's conflicts is very interesting. Her chemistry with Hachiman is gold and it's always a delight to see them interacting.

These two characters make the show for me, but it's not as if everyone else is crappy. It's basically high school politics: the anime but with some lighthearted shenanigans.",1435708800,2,1027,4.764044943820225
6347178,5,B00J9IP7NO,"I watched this on Crunchyroll and had to buy it. Since the description of what you actually get is incomplete, I thought I would add to it here.

The discs cover all of season 1. Season 2 is still showing in Japan, but I have been watching it too on Crunchyroll, and it's excellent as well (so I will purchase it when it comes out on DVD).
There is no paper insert, just 3 discs, region 1 (USA player OK). Menu is in English. Episodes are Japanese, with English subtitles (no English dub, but honestly, the voice actors were great for me.) Made in USA.

Disc 1: Episode 1: And so their mistaken youth begins; 2: Surely everyone has their fair share of troubles; 3: Sometimes the God of rom-coms does nice things; 4: In other words, he doesn't have many friends. Special features: Also available from Sentai Filmworks (previews or opening songs with animation for Dog and Scissors, Busou Shinki, Henneko ~ Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat, Devil Survivor 2, plus disc credits)
Disc 2: Episode 5: One again he turns back to the path from whence he came; 6: His beginning with her finally ends; 7: Anyway, getting no rest, even though it's summer break, just isn't right; 8: One day, they will learn the truth; 9: For the third time he turns back to the path from whence he came.
Disc 3: Episode 10: The distance between them remains unchanged as the festival becomes a carnival; 11: And so the curtain on each stage rises, and the festival is festivaling its very best; 12: Thus, his and her and her youth continues to be wrong; 13: And so, their festival will never end. Special features: Clean opening animation; clean closing animations.

The dialogue is smart and funny. The main three characters are all interesting, and I like them all very much. The boy (Hachiman Hikigaya) is very compelling, and though he is a loner with a pessimistic view on youth and relationships, he has a Sherlockian sense about others' feelings and inner thoughts. Thankfully, he uses this sense for good rather then evil. And even though others don't always agree with how he goes about solving others' problems they can't argue with the results.

A little about me: 49 year old woman from New England (USA) with 15 year old son, who also likes the show.",1434240000,5,2235,4.58
6347179,5,B00J9IP7NO,"Hachiman the lead of the series is not necessarily a pessimist but a realist. Thus this becomes an unraveling of the superficiality of social interactions as well as revealing truths of how very harsh and critical youths can be to each other. Though it also examines human relationships too.

There is a use of monologuing by the main character which is witty. Kind of reminds one of Bakemonogatori though less over the top.
My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU as it has now been dubbed in North America is originally based off the light novels by Wataru Watari.",1427068800,,556,4.731958762886598

6347183,5,B00J9IP7NO,"Great story about a socially inept teen and learning about the growing pains that typically occur during the high school years. This anime gives a main character without any unexplained adulation from females that seems to be the norm in most of the shoes popping up today. I've watched the series about 5 times and is one of my favorites, bought the dvd to thank the makers in a way.",1412380800,3,384,4.5

8649044,5,B00J9IP7NO,"This romantic comedy is interesting because it is like the mystery romantic and friendship novel in the point of their suggestive word, dialogue and conversation.
There are three main characters who are a high school guy, Hachiman Hikigaya, and two high school lady, Yukino Yukinoshita and Yui Yuigahama.
Three person has the same characteristic that they are actually lonely. Such people are called ""BOTCHI"" nowadays in Japan.

Hachiman is smart and often has a too venomous tongue, and not handsome, so he is always alone. Yukino is one of the smartest lady and the most beautiful girl in the school and so much talented other than study. She is the beauty but also often remarks too frankly, so has few friends. Yui is a bit scatterbrain, but beautiful, kind and good-natured lady. She looks like to have some friends but no one is real actually because she is always gauge other ones feeling and cannot say her real mind. So, indeed, Yui is also alone.

The word ""BOTCHI"" is so often used in this story in the sense of lonely, isolated person. I think that one of the theme is how ""BOTCHI"" would be able to form the friendship and the love each other.

Their word or conversation is always suggestive. For example, Hachiman is usually called ""HIKITANI"" by the wrong last name but the few uses the correct ""HIKIGAYA"" to distinguish of the two word for the special meaning.

These three special characterized students belong to volunteer club. They give advices and cooperate to solve the problems in the high school. Hachinan has tendency to use too venomous tongue and has often been misunderstood to be cruel. Yukino also has sharp tongue, but on the other hand, she tries to solve by the smart way.

Yukino and Yui does not like Hachiman at first, but they become to understand his venomous tongues are good way to solve the problems without problems on the other than Hachiman himself and always he sacrifices himself and nobody has unpleasant feeling. Though Yukino and Yui does not recognize, but a bit romantic emotion has been occurring in the minds of Yukino and Yui. Also, Yukino and Hachiman or Yui and Hachiman has the opportunities to go out with but they are not real dates. In this series, Yukino and Yui gradually devote themselves to Hachiman. Yui shows the honest emotion to Hachiman, but Yukino subdue her favor to him.

The high school life are described vividly through the activities and relationship with the other student. For example, Yui are about to lose the tennis game with rival, but Yukino plays the game-changing role and advantageously promotes the tennis game and finaly, Hachiman comes from behind for victory. The highlight is the volunteer club work of high school festival. In fact, the vice chairwoman of the committee, Yukino is the real chairman and she accomplishes the works smartly. On the other hand, Hachiman also cooperates by his way and he is misunderstood to be the villain. Though Yukino and Yui does not like his way, but they get to understand he cooperates as their best buddies. I guess that this is the onset of true romantic comedy between Yukino, Yui and Hachiman. The problem to be solved is which lady Hachiman would love in the future.

The storys title includes the word romantic, but their relationship is ambiguous in this first season.

In Japan, 2nd season was broadcast from this spring to summer. In it, the story become somehow more romantic. Please note that this DVD does not contain the 2nd season's stories.",1447372800,,3483,4.803005008347245
8649045,4,B00J9IP7NO,"The delivery was fast and packaged well. However, what I didn't like was just sentai filmworks not making a dub on this anime. I think this anime is pretty good and I wished it didn't just have subtitles, but an english dub and subtitles. However, this work is still good.",1447200000,,272,4.46
8649046,5,B00J9IP7NO,"The first season of SNAFU is required in order to understand the second season, which is a near masterpiece and a day one purchase when it comes out. On it's own, SNAFU season 1 is still very solid. The main character has a unique antisocial personality that results in interesting social interactions, the main girls are interesting, cute, and well-developed, there is a good amount of sociological and psychological commentary, and a bit of romance.",1444953600,,451,5.026666666666666
8649047,4,B00J9IP7NO,"The subtitles aren't the most attractive to look at.  A little low quality and they aren't the traditional white words with black borders, they are yellow words with black borders.",1442361600,,180,5.0
