8031263,4,B0002SCOMC,"Although the cliffhangers consist of way too many hero-wakes-up-and-rolls-out-of-the-way situations, this is a surprisingly good Western.  In many ways it has more the feel of a feature B-Western than a serial.

The late 1940's was a period of decline in the serial genre, and perhaps Republic was reaching when they felt the need to attract an audience by making serials about Jesse and Frank James.  They couldn't very well have criminals as heroes, so they made them reform and help others face down the bad guys--in fact this was the third and last of the Jesse James serials.  Keith Richards and Robert Bice were bit players in lots of B-Westerns, surprisingly elevated to star status as the leads.  They underplay their parts admirably, and though they didn't have much of a pedigree they seem to develop a little charisma as they go along.  Keith Richards especially, as Jesse, grows into the part as the plot develops.

Roy Barcroft, perhaps the most beloved B-Western baddie of all time, is at his best here.  Noel Neill's cutesy presence worked well when she played Lois Lane in the ""Superman"" serials, but she doesn't seem quite right in the role of a frontier heroine.  Dale Van Sickle and Tom Steele were given credits for roles as minor thugs, so you can bet they did a lot of the stunt doubling--as did David Sharpe, though uncredited.

The plot is a rather interesting treatment of the James Brothers' attempts to go straight.  It gets better as it goes along, and the last few chapters are actually rather exciting.  I steadily increased my rating as the chapters proceeded.  By the end, I found myself enjoying it far more than I had expected to.",1151366400,,1664,4.776223776223776
