8258428,4,B0015H0MAA,"Pretty good precursor to the El Santo films.  Spanish-language, Mexican-made.  Very long though, just over two hours.  The plot involves El Enmascarado de Plata (The Silver Mask), who is a bad guy, squaring off against El Medico Asesino (The Medic Assassin), who is a good guy.  The bad guy and his henchmen spends most of the movie kidnapping and threatening a man and his niece over and over again, and the good guy rescuing them over and over again.  At one point the bad guy changes masks and changes his alias to El Tigre (The Tiger).  The good guy spends his time in hospital scrubs.  The quality is of the DVD is very good.  Recommended for wrestling hero fans.",1398038400,,668,4.554621848739496
