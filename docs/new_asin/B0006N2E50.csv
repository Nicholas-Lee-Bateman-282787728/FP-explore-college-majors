8041879,3,B0006N2E50,"Films like these used to be made all the time in Mexico and then shown on late-night Spanish TV well into the early 1990s. Both the films on this DVD are from the mid-to-late 1970s, well past the prime of the lucha libre movie genre, but they are still good clean fun.

The ""Bermuda Triangle"" one is probably of the most interest to casual fans who've never seen a lucha libre film before, because it stars Santo, Blue Demon, and Mil Mascaras - three of the most-famous Mexican wrestlers of the 20th Century. On the positive side, all three wrestlers have distinct personalities and senses of humor about themselves, which is a very good thing. Unfortunately, the story is very disjointed and there isn't a lot of actual wrestling to be seen. Santo was quite old when he made this film and in some scenes it definitely shows. Still, if you'd like to see what the original Santo and Blue Demon (as opposed to their wresting heirs El Hijo del Santo y Blue Demon Jr)were like this isn't a bad place to start.

The ""Mummies"" film is misleading in that there's really no castle, Zulma Faiad never wears a sexy dress that looks like the one on the movie poster, the mummies are really zombies, and the movie takes place in Guatemala, not Guanajuato. On the other hand, this is one of the campier of the genre with villainy and scenes almost out of an Adam West ""Batman"" episode. If you've got the right sense of humor, there are plenty of laughs. Of the three leads, only Tineblas is recognized as a superior wrestler and this is obvious in the many action sequences. I know that a lot of fans who know much more about this genre than I do can't stand this film, but I enjoyed it. I think you might too. To me, a movie such as this is what a Republic movie serial made in the 1970s might have looked like.

Judging this as a late-night double feature, this isn't bad entertainment at all if you like lucha libre films. There are both better and worse examples of lucha libre movies out there.",1287619200,,1986,4.420765027322404
8041880,5,B0006N2E50,"I'm a huge fan of lucha libre and its sacred traditions, so I'm very partial to this double feature with El Santo, Blue Demon, and Mil Mascaras.  When these three Mexican legends are put in one movie, you buy it.

The story is silly and the productions values are wanting, but the campy story is a ton of fun.  Vintage automobiles and clothes abound, along with some great lucha action in ring and out.  Mil Mascaras getting jumped at the docks while carrying home groceries is a great moment in the movie.  Gringos be advised, it is in spanish with no subtitles, so be ready for that.  It's a lot of fun even if you can't understand the words.

Seriously, buy it used or new.  You've come to this page to look at the video and read the reviews.  Just buy it.",1198800000,4,759,4.288732394366197
8041881,3,B0006N2E50,"I saw this flick in a film class with English subtitles. I found it on Amazon advertising subtitles. However, there aren't any subtitles. (Okay, I guess if you speak Spanish or want it just for the macho bizarro visuals...personally I am pretty disappointed.)",1184976000,2,259,5.046511627906977
8041882,4,B0006N2E50,"These movies are super rare and hard to find. Thank goodness for this distributor, and thank Amazon.com for its truly efficient shipping system. This disc contains one cult classic and one sequel to a cult classic.
""El Castillo...Guanajuato"" is not really a sequel but it shares the same title with an earlier film, ""Las Momias de Guanajuato"" (a true classic of this genre).
""Misterio en las Bermudas"" is a must-have for any real fan of ""Luchadores Enmascarados"". It was the last time that the big three (Santo, Blue Demon, Mil Mascaras) would ever share the screen.
The story is very good, but the plot is a bit muddled. The quality of picture is very good. I now have three copies of this film and this one is the best. There are no English subtitles, though.
The story concerns  the attempted kidnapping and assassination of a certain Iranian princess who happens to be a Karate champ. The Vizier of Iran is in business with the Mexican government and hires the three wrestlers to protect his daughter.
There is also an odd sub-plot involving one of the bad guys girls. Apparently the girl has become remorseful and joined some otherworldly group of guys wearing silver outfits. These guys, I assume, are extraterrestrials and have discovered the secret of immortality. I assume because like I wrote earlier, the plot is a bit muddled. Anyway, these guys are the ones responsible for the disappearances in the Bermuda triangle.
The second movie on this disc, ""El Castillo...Guanajuato"" is pretty good, but not as good as those starring the Big Three (Santo, Blue Demon, Mil Mascaras). Instead this movie stars three wrestlers that had a limited following in Mexico, but failed to reach international status. Superzan and Tinieblas went on to star in a series of films on their own, usually alongside a host of other wrestler-types.
This one is okay. It's a rehash of the old formula : Mad Scientist creates zombie-mummies, kidnap women, and are stopped by three masked men in tights. On the plus side their costumes are pretty cool. Tinieblas' outfit resembles videogame ninjas ala Mortal Kombat, and they wear shiny, flowing capes and plastic gloves like Captain America. The third wrestler, Blue Angel, wears a mask that looks almost exactly like Captain America's. He is obviously an alternate version of Blue Demon. The Big Three were not available for this movie for many reasons. One reason was that Santo, Blue Demon, and Mil were off doing ""Misterio...Bermudas"" (a much better film).
""Misterio...Bermudas"" was made at the peak of public interest in the genre and it was meant to be a final installment in the series. They would end it on a high note. Several copy-cat sequels followed nonetheless. ""El Castillo....Guanajuato"" was made the same year as ""Misterio..."". Unfortunately it exhibits all of the worst aspects of a sequel of this variety - Formulaic plot, bad acting, and clumsy fight scenes.
The worst part of it all is the use of wrestlers other than the Big Three. It is almost as if the Producers of these movies began to see a profit, but misjudged the root of that profit, which was the charisma and real-life professionalism of its stars, Santo, Blue Demon, and Mil Mascaras.
With ""El Castillo...Guanajuato"" the genre begins to show its age. Find a copy of ""Las Momias De Guanajuato"" to see the genre at its peak, or just flip the dual sided disc and watch ""Misterio en las Bermudas"" to see how it all ends.",1114041600,13,3433,4.8483816013628624
