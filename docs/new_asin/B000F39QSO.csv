2550128,5,B000F39QSO,"This review applies to both volumes (Hot Salsa Lessons vol. 1 & 2). These are excellent salsa instructional DVDs for the following reasons:

I have seen 2 other top instructional salsa DVD series from two different but highly respected salsa instructors but by far Ken Baldwin explaines in such careful detail each aspect of each basic step, drill, salsa pattern or styling move that he teaches.

These other teachers tend to show you the moves or patterns rather quickly, and the way they teach/demonstrate the moves often has you wondering ""How did they do that?"" or ""I don't get it"" or ""How do my feet move again?"" or ""What do I do with my hands again?"" etc. I find myself having to replay them over and over again to try and figure out the moves mostly by obsevation.

But Ken Baldwin teaches in much more depth and shows that he cares by being serious in what he teaches. Foot-cam close ups, salsa patterns shown at regular AND slow-motion speed, original salsa music to practice to (Vol 2) are just a few of the many features and bonuses on these DVDs.

Although serious and professional in teaching, there is also an enjoyable light-hearted aspect as well and both volumes include some very humorous moments. I found myself laughing quite a few times. They are fun to watch and a great learning tool.

I highly recommend.",1151798400,8,1328,4.6581196581196584
2550129,5,B000F39QSO,after veiwing ken's first dvd I couldn't wait for this second dvd to come out and continue this great series in salsa dancing. The main reason I liked the first dvd was the simple and clear way the moves were explained and presented and broken down. I was very happy to see that this second dvd continues this exellent way of teaching and smoothly brings you up from begginner to intermediate level.another bonous in this dvd is the fantastic salsa music that can be played seperatly for practice. This dvd was worth every penny I spent for it and I'm all hope that this isn't the last one in this series.,1150416000,4,605,4.45945945945946

8116748,5,B000F39QSO,"I actually own the two-disc set that includes this Volume 2 DVD.  That set is apparently now out of print. If you need to learn Salsa I HIGHLY recommend you pick up this DVD as well as Volume 1, both of which are still available at good prices here on Amazon.  Ken Baldwin's teaching style is the best I have seen and this DVD is even better than Volume 1, which I rated highly in my review of that in 2006 here on Amazon.

Enough said.  Buy it already. :)",1404432000,,456,4.033333333333333
8116749,5,B000F39QSO,"I am a great fan of Ken Baldwin's Hot Salsa. I bought volume 1 and then bid for volume 2 for a long time before I was able to buy it. Ken Baldwin's absence is a great loss for Salsa dance lovers and quite frankly for him too. We need for him to come back to the Salsa scene where he belongs. His lessons are insightful and he is a delight to watch. In other words, Ken is a natural that stands out among the crowd. His dvd is much more interesting than the majority of Salsa dance dvds.
When he realizes that he still has much more to offer and decides that he must not give up on his goals, we will all be better off as a result.

8116750,5,B000F39QSO,Ken Baldwin is very good video instructer. Easy to follow and understand. Very good purchase for instruction.,1175731200,,109,5.470588235294118
8116751,4,B000F39QSO,If you are a beginner much like myself or somewhat more advanced there is useful stuff in this dvd.  My wife and I both recommend this dvd to anyone looking to add to the learning experience or if you're just looking to add a new spin on your style.,1162684800,2,249,4.081632653061225
8116752,5,B000F39QSO,"Within the plethora of Salsa dance instruction DVDs and videos, one series shines bright, Hot Salsa Lessons by Ken Baldwin.  Ken's love of his craft resonates in his new Volume 2 DVD where he builds on lessons learned in his earlier edition.  What sets Ken's instruction apart is his ability to teach Salsa dance in a way that is both clear and detailed without being lengthy and hard to memorize.  Ken first shows you what the step or pattern looks like, again in slow motion, then breaks it down into easily digestible pieces for both the men's and ladies steps.  In addition to the mechanics of the dance, Ken teaches you how to dance with style so that you'll look great, confident and not like you're executing a series of pattern steps painted on the dance floor.  The last and, in my opinion, the most important thing imparted from Hot Salsa Lessons, Volume 1 & 2 and especially in Volume 2, is the joy of Salsa dancing.  Ken will infuse you with the passion and excitement of Salsa dance and give you the know how and confidence to do so; it will show on your feet, your body and the smile on your face every time you're on the dance floor for all to see.",1157328000,5,1163,4.386046511627907
8116753,5,B000F39QSO,"Ken Baldwin's Hot Salsa Lessons, Vol. 2 is a ""must have"" for every salsa dancer. I've been fortunate to have taken several of Ken's classes in person and I think he is one of the smoothest dancers around. His techniques and patterns are fun and easy to learn. His instructions are clear and simple.

In Ken's latest video, he reviews that basics (very important) then goes on to show different variations of the men's open break and cross body. He covers a little bit of styling for both men and women. He introduces 5 new patterns including the very important ""dip"" (the ladies love this). Another reason I enjoyed this video is the clips of Ken dancing socially. He has several of this clips strategically placed between chapters and various sections. The clips are fun to watch and you can actually pick up additional patterns from them. The choice of music is awesome and Ken actually has the full 3 songs as a part of this video.  Lastly, Vanessa, Ken's dance partner in the video, is the soooo fine. Together, they make a wonderful dance couple. Both are exceptional dancers and so much fun to watch.

I've been dancing salsa for over a year and a half and have incorporated a lot of Ken's moves and styling into my own style. I've actually received a lot of positive feedback from the ladies. I hope you will enjoy Ken's video just as much as I have. Thanks and ""chevere..."".",1156464000,5,1382,4.564516129032258
8116754,5,B000F39QSO,"Outstanding!! Please come out with more DVDs! This instructor is the best I've come across. He gives you the technique and insights of a master dancer. (especially from the leaders perspective) Good technique is  essential to dancing well and worth hundreds of dollars in private instruction. There are DVDs with more patterns but they are ""fools gold"" for rank beginners who are misled in what they need to dance well. They are badly taught by rushed and incompetant  instructors, who emphasize no technique or style. They make the leader and follower look like a comedy act on the dance floor. Without technique you can't lead or do the dance with anyone, well that is.",1154649600,5,671,4.87719298245614
8116755,5,B000F39QSO,"After viewing tons of different beginner and intermediate salsa videos, I believe that this volume 2 of Hot Salsa is a great and uniquely organized instructional DVD. There was an attention to detail that I found helpful (particularly for those that are transitioning from beginner to an intermediate level); he managed to do this without dragging it to long like some other videos do. In addition, my partner and I really liked how he worked in variations; for example, he taught variations for open breaks and for cross body leads. Although they are not different patterns in of themselves, they are simple and easy to learn moves that add variety to one's dance, especially for beginners who have a limited number of patterns to work with. One thing that was also different that I liked about this video was that he included a section with music (very good music too). Therefore, instead of practicing when they practice, you have the ability to just select your music on the DVD and practice with your partner. The only thing that I would have liked in this video are more patterns; however, if you include the patterns taught in his first DVD, with that of his second, and include his variations, one actually has a decent amount of material to work with on the dance floor. For a long standing intermediate salsa dancer myself, I am looking forward to seeing what he can put forth in his advanced videos.",1154390400,9,1410,4.735772357723577
8116756,5,B000F39QSO,"Hello, my name is David and Im a 'Salsaholic'.I own over twenty instructional DVD's, but I can stop buying them any time I like. At least that's what I tell myself.

  Ken's DVD's are at the very top of my most watched. You really get alot packed into this one. He spends alot of time with the small simple stuff which makes you a much more stylish dancer, (It's the small moves that get you noticed).

  If you want fifteen complex patterns and not much else, this really isn't for you.(there are five cool ones at the end though).

  I have to mention the music in this one,it's so fresh and will stay in your head for days after you first hear it.

  If there is anyone who loves dancing & teaching Salsa more than Ken, I've not come across him. (although the dude from ""the learn to dance salsa series"" comes a close second)  VIVA LA SALSA",1152576000,7,843,4.2594936708860756
