5891019,5,B00E58EAJ0,"Loved this. Completely unpredictable up until the last minute! Actors delivered great performances for such a low budget film. Lots of scary moments, yet lots of comedic relief as well. I found myself laughing and screaming throughout. And the way the suspense builds, without all the usual gore/sex/language usually found in teenage thrillers... kudos to the director for creating such a unique film that is genuinely scary, yet family-friendly! (But I wouldn't take a child under 13, since it IS pretty scary).

On top of that, they continued to go deeper into the cave, it made absolutely no sense. I always hate it when people do the total opposite of what makes sense, even if it's a movie.

5891070,2,B00E58EAJ0,"Horror movies have a fairly high bar to reach just because there have been many, extremely good, horror movies.  On the plus side, this movie tries to bring a little something new to the genre.  On the negative side, this movie struggles to go into full-on scare mode.  In total, this movie fails to make a solid horror-movie grade.

The basic story is right out of the teenage horror movie manual.  A group of friends go visit an abandoned mine where people have died, on Halloween night, during a full moon.  You know something horrible has to happen, right?

At first, it appears that this movie is more about a bunch of dumb teenagers, as they manage to get themselves trapped in the mine (oh, unexpected shock, yawn).  Then one of the teenagers appears to have died in a horrible way.  The level of tension ramps up, and I was prepared for a full-on scare as another person seems to fall victim to some unknown horror.

The only problem is that the horror failed to go to the next level.  If there was a monster, why did the monster fail to make an appearance?  If there was a ghost, why no visions of the ghost in conjunction with the terrible deaths and injuries?  There is an answer to these questions, which I will not tell you because I am not out to spoil the plot.  At a certain point in a horror movie, a director has to ""seal the deal"" to clinch the true horror of the movie.  The ""clincher"" here develops so slowly that you see it coming from too far away.  When the alleged ""shocking moment"" is revealed, I was starting to root for the moment to happen just to end the movie.  SOMEBODY PLEASE GET ME OUT OF THIS MOVIE!

I have to give this movie a few points, or a star, for trying to bring a new twist to the horror movie genre.  The problem is that trying and succeeding are two different things.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a somewhat family friendly horror movie, i.e., minimal real blood and gore, no nudity, and the barest modicum of sexual tension, then this movie is one way to introduce novices to the horror movie genre.  The problem is, of course, is that an introduction is hardly a substitute for the real thing.

The bottom line is that this movie has an interesting concept that the director misses pulling off.  Young children might find this movie relatively scary, but only because they are unlikely to have been exposed to good, classic, serious horror.  Experienced horror film fans will likely be intrigued at first, but any initial interest will eventually devolve into boredom, and the realization that the movie promises far more than it delivers.

Good luck!",1425772800,,2614,4.487288135593221

5891096,2,B00E58EAJ0,"Well you know when the DVD cover image has a dark haired girl on it, and there are no dark haired girls (just two blondes) who are part of the group of five teens who go into an abandoned and supposedly haunted mine, that it's pretty much amateur hour (well hour and a half) on your TV screen.  The acting by the male actors is terrible, it's like the girls are acting students and need a portfolio of work to get into a particular university or are about to graduate an acting course and need to get an agent so just grabbed a couple of guys they knew to play the other roles.  Well Alexa Vega was in the Spy Kid franchise so that's not obviously the case but that is what the viewing experience of this film feels like.  She had dark hair then so perhaps they took the cover shot when in that or another dark haired role. The cover image only has a vague resemblance to three of the characters anyway, so it's possibly not even them, and five teens go into the mine so why only three anyway? Whatever happened the cover image stuff up shows the professional effort put into this film, that one it happened, and two no one noticed it.  The script was poor and there are some ridiculous editing decisions. Why show some sort of found footage spliced in between recording live with helmet cam viewing experience?  This just gives away what will happen before we the viewer even get there.

Vega does a pretty good job in this one, I'll give the film that, and I hope her career isn't derailed by this disaster, but she's just let down by the male actors' ability and a pretty weak script. Saige Thompson who plays the other female Laurie, does an all right job and initially plays a strong character but the writing for her to act out just got stupid as the film went on.  The Indian guy, what was that all about?  Did the investors just go, well the Big Band Theory and a couple of other popular shows at the moment have an Indian guy in them who fans like, so we want one in ours too. Were they hoping this film would be big in India?  Of course those shows have good writers, that's what they forgot.  This film's Indian character just brought nothing to the small town characters set up, somehow he had an expert knowledge of the working of mines, how the air tunnels are built and other stuff it's pretty implausible he'd know.  He tries to make fun of his Indian heritage but it just doesn't work and even comes across as a little racist.

For a supposedly scary film, there's also no scary scenes at all.",1416355200,2,2510,4.305732484076433

The kids make some references to ghost possessions of a humans body, but thats about it until one gets possessed and #$%@$ one of the friends. Then we have the weird ending with a funeral and the possessed staring off in nevernever land The End!!!

5891101,2,B00E58EAJ0,"I was looking for a movie to watch on Halloween night, and I somehow ended up in this Abandoned Mine.  Its about five young people going on a Halloween night adventure, so I figured I would just go with it.  There were some warning signs early on.  First, the opening credits reveal that the film was written, directed, and produced by one person (Jeff Chamberlain)  and that almost never leads to a good outcome.  Then were hit with some quick snippets of bad things to come, long before the story premise even establishes itself.  Why do filmmakers do this?  Its incredibly annoying.  So we finally get the five main characters established, and it just doesnt feel right.  You have Brad (Reiley McClendon), his girlfriend Sharon (the very attractive Alexa Vega), Brads ex-girlfriend and Sharons good friend Laurie (Saige Thompson), Brads generic jock sidekick Jimmy (Adam Hendershott), and Lauries friend Ethan (Charan Prabhakar).  From the start, I felt that there was just something off about Brad and Laurie, especially Laurie, whose sketchy backstory ends up being pretty much of no importance.  Thank goodness for the India-born Ethan, as his personality serves to at least make the movie somewhat enjoyable.  The other characters are just sort of there for the ride.

So the gang accompanies Brad to a haunted mine.  For some reason, they all seem to think they're going to some other haunted mine and not the locally infamous Jarvis Mine, where a man and his two daughters were supposedly buried alive (intentionally) a century ago  and where several people have gone missing over the years.  Of course, despite all of their reluctance to actually enter a dangerous and supposedly haunted mine, they have few qualms about shimmying twenty feet down into it with a rope and  you guessed it  getting stuck down there.  Its pretty hard for me to care about anyone stupid enough to do that sort of thing,

The film does manage to drag out the answer as to whether or not the mine is actually haunted, but no real surprises await the viewer.  Actually, things get a little silly toward the end, resulting in an ending that fails to impress.  Nothing in this entire film really engaged me, not even the claustrophobic scenes of these young people crawling through tiny shafts.

5891104,2,B00E58EAJ0,"Abandoned Mine (Jeff Chamberlain, 2013)

Abandoned Mine started off with a bangthere are some nifty filmmaking techniques that make it seem like you're going to get something much more than you are from this low-budget horrorfest. For some reason, however, Chamberlain abandons the pretense to the avant-garde once things get rolling, and we end up with a straightforward haunted-mine tale, mediocre but watchable.

Plot: Brad (Pearl Harbor's Reiley McClendon) is a post-high-school layabout in a small rural town, bored out of his skull. His ex-girlfriend Laurie (Reservations' Saige Thompson) is back in town, so he cooks up an ideathe two of them, Brad's current girlfriend Sharon (Spy Kids' Alexa PenaVega), Laurie's schoolmate Ethan (High School Musical 2's Charan Prabhakar), and Brad's best friend Jim (Radio Flyer's Adam Hendershott), will spend the night near the mouth of the legendary Jarvis Mine, supposedly haunted by the family of the Jarvis that the mine is named for. A thunderstorm drives them inside, and weird things start happening...

Unfortunately, none of those weird things are terribly unpredictable; you should be on the right track relatively soon, and from there, aside from some appealing ambiguity as to what's really going on with one of the characters, it unfolds in paint-by-numbers fashion. This has a surprisingly high-powered cast for such a shoestring affair, and despite being stereotypes, the characters are at least affable (I waffled the whole movie on whether Ethan was offensive or the best character in the entire movie). I've seen far worse movies this year, but I've seen far better as well. **",1410220800,,1640,5.3

A group of friends gets together for Halloween and camp out in front of a mine with a spooky past. A big rain storm comes and they have to venture in the mine. The ring leader, who was the high school football star, convinces his friends to do a little exploring.

I didn't know what direction this movie was going and kept thinking to myself while watching it I'm so freaked out by what's probably going to happen and This is probably one of the best scary movies I've seen. I was literally excited to own this movie while watching it. haha And then . . . the second half of the movie happened. I feel like the director started out with this great idea and just didn't know where to go with it. Everything about the second half was so weak in comparison to the first half. There were so many other (better) directions this movie could have gone to make it amazing. It's extremely clean for a scary movie. I think it's still worth checking out, especially for the first half. Make sure the lights are off to help set the mood. It'll probably be better too if you watch it with someone who gets scared easily. lol I'm buying it since I love Halloween and any scary/spookie movies PG-13 and under.

Sure, the acting isn't perfect and this wasn't a blockbuster film, but it definitely has some strong points. First, you can watch it with your whole family without being embarrassed. That can be hard to do nowadays! Second, the plot twists keep this interesting to the very end. I wouldn't call this a ""horror"" film -- I would call it paranormal suspense with horror elements (think Blair Witch Project). I think it's a great movie for Halloween and would definitely recommend it to family and friends. Also, I loved the Indian Jones character. He provided some nice comic relief.",1382918400,,710,4.925
5891120,1,B00E58EAJ0,"I rented this movie based off of a glance at the trailer and the average rating on Amazon. It's about Halloween, so I wasn't looking for anything great--just a decent popcorn horror movie. My wife and I are huge horror fans, so we're used to finding little things in otherwise mediocre movies to enjoy.

Big mistake. It really doesn't have anything going for it--the script is weak, and at times barely coherent. The cinematography is amateurish, while the editing is often confusing during action scenes. The actors aren't offensive, but it's hard to gauge their talent, as they really don't have a lot to work with. I was excited to see a South Asian actor get screen time in an American movie, as that's a pretty rare thing, but he was wasted as comic relief. The movie, unusual for the genre, is also bloodless both literally and figuratively. That's not a deal-breaker, but going that route amps up the difficulty for any filmmaker, and I just don't think that Jeff Chamberlain could deliver here. It requires subtlety, but Abandoned Mine is more boring than anything else.

After watching this, I went back and checked out the positive reviews. There are a lot of them. Why? I searched for a little more info on the movie, and found that it had been originally targeted at LDS folks as a family-friendly horror option. That makes sense--I'd imagine there's a dearth of LDS horror out there, so I can understand being excited to have *anything* out there to watch at all if you're a Mormon family who likes spooky movies.

I'm not against horror that's appropriate for a wide age range and conservative tastes (I liked Signs), but I think that when you're making niche movies, you really need to respect your audience, and not just pump out a product that you know will be consumed because there's nowhere else for people to go. Being a fan of good found-footage movies, I can recognize that sort of cynicism when I see it. Think hard before you spend your money on this one.

If you're a typical genre fan: skip this.
If you're desperate for subterranean horror: check out ""The Descent"" or maybe the original ""My Bloody Valentine.""
If you want horror appropriate for the whole family: Try ""Signs."" I'd also honestly recommend digging up some of Nickelodeon's ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" episodes over this film.",1382832000,14,2319,4.732673267326732

5891126,1,B00E58EAJ0,"When I was a kind in summer camp, I once tried to tell my roommates scary story based on a Twilight Zone episode. I screwed up the timing, mangled the plot, and left out most of the bits that made it work.

This movie was worse.

Others have talked about the low quality of the acting, script, and direction. I agree with them. In addition, several have mentioned the lot twist ending. And yes, it has a twist ending of a sort, but the twist is heavily telegraphed starting from a very early scene. There was a sliver of a moment towards the end when the plot could have redeemed itself just a little bit by pulling a highly unlikely but at least vaguely amusing rabbit out of its hat - but it didn't. Instead the ending was almost incomprehensible - a kind oh, ""Oh, okay. So I guess the ghost was [redacted]. I guess that sort of makes sense ... Maybe? Not really?""

But the movie's biggest sin by far: It's boring. And not because there's no death on-screen, not because there's no gore - but because there's no real tension. The best scene in the movie happens early on when [minor spoiler] the big guy freaks out in a small tunnel because he is claustrophobic. I would say that everything else is ruined by the camera-work or dialogue, but in fact I don't think the script itself had a whole lot of tension in it.

I talked my partner into watching this with me based on the Amazon reviews from about a week ago. In the future, I am going to be much more careful about obviously astro-turfed reviews. Otherwise he may bever watch a movie with me again.",1380758400,5,1556,4.3367697594501715

As a parent, here's how I see it. If you're ADHD-challenged, looking for gruesome horror, sprinkled with sex by hot teens who are of the Reality TV and Twitter culture, you will likely be disappointed.

If you're looking for a fresh alternative to all this, you could easily find the movie an entertaining departure from Hollywood's horror formula. In fact, its not really horror. Its more of a mystery/suspense drama told through the eyes of small-town teens living in a somewhat mythical culture referred to as ""Happy Valley."" Yes, the characters and situation appear very broad at first - even stereotypical. But you soon realize this is intentional and allows two different audiences to easily connect with the story - teens with the terrifying PG-13 survival story, and adults with the added layer of the filmmaker's understated social commentary.
