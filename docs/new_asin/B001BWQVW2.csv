3499654,5,B001BWQVW2,Jonas Kaufmann is a tenor without equal in my opinion and this DVD shows his unique artistry at its best.  I cannot get enough of this lively performance; I watch it over and over.,1232323200,5,180,4.294117647058823
3499655,5,B001BWQVW2,"If they give awards for opera performances, Anna Caterina Antonacci as Carmen and Jonas Kaufmann as Don Jose are surely both deserving of the highest honors.  The singing, acting and sizzling passion between them in this production is extraordinary!  I am a big admirer of Jonas Kaufmann and he was simply wonderful in this role.  But, I've got to say, I was unexpectedly blown away by Anna Caterina Antonacci!  I've seen her sing and act very expressively in a few Don Giovanni productions as Elvira, but I guess a role like Carmen is required in order to truly cut loose.  And she did.  Jonas Kaufmann I've compared to Placido Domingo before and here he sounds just as powerful and promising.  The energy expended in the final act between these two was explosive.

Ildebrando D'Arcangelo was a gorgeous Escamillo entering on a gorgeous black horse.  He was a perfect foil for Jonas Kaufmann.  Norah Amsellem is a powerful singer with the intensity of an Isolde or a Brunnhilde, so to hear her cast as the shy, village girl Micaela is a little disconcerting.  She has enough power and presence to be Carmen.  But, I'm not complaining; she was excellent.

The supporting cast and chorus were terrific.  The orchestra was perfect.

This is a marvelous Carmen.  You'll love it!",1229040000,20,1275,4.806451612903226
3499656,5,B001BWQVW2,"In plain English, Jonas Kaufmann steals the show.  Not that everyone else is not good, but he is so intense in his singing and acting that the performance becomes exciting and electrifying when he is on stage.  Buy it--you'll like it.",1228262400,11,234,4.682926829268292
3499657,5,B001BWQVW2,"Oh, yes, the conductor had a few 'mishaps' in certain places, and the supporting cast of Micaela and Escamillo are not nearly as good as the leading roles of Carmen and Jose, but overall, this production is about the most entertaining and riveting available on DVD so far, and the 'smaller' roles of the Gipsy camp, are in fact nearly as good as the two leading ones.
Antonacci is a 'soprano' Carmen - this is the first time I see and hear about her, and the impression is not as bad as some critics would allege. Though she is no Berganza, Baltsa, Kasarova, Borodina..., she is every bit as good as Grace Bumbry (with Jon Vickers), and tons better than Julie Migens (with Domingo).
Then Kaufmann's Jose is nothing short of a revelation. I don't see why an opera singer would need to do funny things on stage in order to attract attention or 'upgrade' his/her performance. Kaufmann chiefly 'park and bark', as one diva says and claims that it would not work for modern day opera singing. HOWEVER, Kaufmann's way of 'parking' and 'barking' is intrinsically linked with the role that he is singing. There is absolutely no need for a singer to dance around the stage, or doing all sorts of 'funny' things like twisting of body truncks, throwing up of limbs, or grimacing of features, or dressing up in outrages outfits.  No - none of such nonesense. Mr. Kaufmann teaches opera singers what ACTING is. I wonder if he has been to a drama school, but would not be surprised if he is being honored by such an institution for his superb stagecraft. And these are on top of his absolutely wonderful voice and singing.
Oh, yes, you will definitely regret if you miss this DVD.",1227744000,13,1666,4.5719063545150505
3499658,5,B001BWQVW2,"This production in a way is a major breakthrough for the male protagonist - Don Jose.
Soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci is a very competent Carmen - in fact, in terms of acting, among the best available.
Other supporting roles like Escamillo and Micaela, however, are not much of a big deal by comparison.
So you would see that this production is unconventional in the sense that the star of the show shifts to Don Jose. And luckily his Carmen is both vocally and dramatically competent as his big 'supporting role'.
This is not a bad idea, either. If hitherto nobody holds much interest or pays much sympathy to this 'mama boy' Jose in Bizet's Carmen, Jonas Kaufmann managed to turn the tables around thoroughly.
His Don Jose is real human flesh and blood. Watch Jose's emotional evolution as the drama unfolds is thrilling experience. Even if Kaufmann has sung better versions of the Flower aria elsewhere, his performance here still steals the show as no Joses did before. And Herr Kaufmann rightfully claims the title of being the Mr. Acrobat of operas, the successor to Cesare Siepi who leaped over 15 feet on stage as Don Giovanni under the baton of Furtwangler at Salzburg more than half a century ago.
One question emerges, though - why the heck does Carmencita forsake Don Jose for the lacklustre Escamillo?",1227398400,4,1314,4.79295154185022
3499659,5,B001BWQVW2,"I had great expectations for this DVD. First reviews were very good; secondly the cast promised great things on paper. For once it isn't necessary to hedge, qualify or equivocate in reviewing a DVD. I know the opera is called Carmen and Antonacci is wonderful, sexy vital and sings quite beautifully. My greatest enthusiasm. however, must go to Jonas Kaufmann's Don Jose. Quite simply it is the best sung and acted Jose I have ever seen or heard. Kaufmann clearly has thought about the character and the music as so much intelligence has gone into the creation we see on stage that I simply can't see it being bettered. Here is a tenor with brains, imagination and the intelligence to see light and shade in Jose's music. Most tenors go at full throttle, screaming out high notes and generally think that Jose is a verismo tenor. Well, he isn't; he is a complex conflicted man and Kaufmann brings this all to the character. The imagination he brings to the Flower Song is even better than Gedda's first go around with the role with Beecham conducting; by the time he recorded it a second time he was content to play the ""tenor"" to his Carmencita, Maria, content with going for volumn alone.

The remainder of the cast is more than first rate, with a fine Michaela from Norah Ansellem and Ildebrando D'arcangelo a properly arrogant Escamillo. Pappano provided wonderful support with the ROH playing beautifully.

The edition used was Oeser which has been savaged by music scholars and critics. I am not a scholar and will make no pretense at being one. But I was thrilled that much of the dialogue was returned and the dreadful recits which are dull musically discarded. And even though the cast had only one native French speaker (I have been told that Ansellelm is French) great effort has been made on the part of the artists to speak the language as very recognizable French. The old French Columbia set which appeared around 1950 established a document that showed how the French would perform Carmen. It wasn't just that the singing was good, but authentic, a groups of singers of a school of singing and acting that no longer exists today. This performance comes closer to that ideal than any I have heard or seen.",1225238400,152,2220,4.704370179948586
3499660,5,B001BWQVW2,"Anna Caterina Antonacci is my favorite ""Carmen"" yet! She is a fabulous
singer and a an excellent actress as well. She also has the looks for
a truly believable Carmen. Jonas Kaufman, as Don Jose, is excellent.
This is my first introduction to his work, and he has a wonderful rich
voice. I never thought anyone could equal Samuel Ramey as the matador
Escamillo, but Ildebrando D'Arcangelo does! He plays the part with relish,
and I love his strong beautiful voice. I like the matador moves he displays in the choreography for his introductory ""Toreador"" song. This
opera is great fun. I own two other very good ""Carmen"" dvd's. One is the
Agnes Baltsa, Carreras and Ramey version and the other is the relatively
recent Carmen that was filmed in Verona with Marina Domashenko and Marco
Berti. This new one, starring Antonacci and Kaufman, is my favorite of the
three. Everything is perfect! It is so much fun to watch and listen to!
Highly recommended!",1225238400,63,950,4.763636363636364
3499661,5,B001BWQVW2,I am pleased that I could have seen this superb production. Chemistry between Carmen and Don Jos works at 100 %. And especially I must compliment performance of Jonas Kaufmann as Don Jos. He to perfection included the whole psychology of Don Jos - from amorousness and apprehension to jealousy and madness. I recommend this great DVD.,1223856000,37,334,4.87719298245614

3499671,5,B001BWQVW2,"Fiery! Passionate!; transformative! Antonacci as Carmen is the ultimate seductress! From the very beginning her Habanera reels you in slowly, methodically. Mesmerized by her panache, her reckless confidence, you follow her wherever she goes unable to stop yourself from falling even to your own death! Like the audience, Don Jose had no chance. As handsome as Jonas Kaufmann is, he has to die. Its in the script. Bizet was brilliant, absolutely brilliant!",1415145600,,455,5.333333333333333

3499675,3,B001BWQVW2,"I am a fan of Kaufmann and he has never diappointed me and he does not this time. The voice, the acting are up to his usual standards.  His Carmen does not quite match him.  The production itself is excellent.  I did not purchase this DVD until recently to see Kaufmann.  I have been in love with the Met production since I saw the HD broadcast.  In a french opera, it is hard to beat Alagna and although he is a little older, the voice and his exhuberance are there.  What makes this Met version head and heels above the Kaufmann version is the Carmen of Elena Garancha.  Of today's Carmens, she is sensational, all the way around.",1410825600,2,632,4.305084745762712

3499678,5,B001BWQVW2,"Periodically I write CARMEN off. It was the first opera I fell in love with at age ten (!). My parents had a highlights set on 78 records. The Flower Song and Carmen's signature arias took up a whole side each, so little of the drama was recorded. But the singers! Gladys Swarthout, an English contralto, as Carmen, Ramon Vinay, a Chilean heldentenor (sic) as Don Jose and Robert Merrill as
the toreador. I played those vinyl discs to death for over a year. Then I discovered Verdi and Wagner, and they swept Bizet into oblivion . . . Well, one afternoon in the late 1970s, on a MET Broadcast Agnes Balsa and Jose Carreras restored my belief that CARMEN is a great opera. What performances they gave, the intensity of the live presentation igniting my listening . . . Now onto the
early 21st century and this recent dvd of a stage performance. Once again, great singers, totally committed, make of CARMEN a singular experience. About Jonas Kaufmann I have only superlatives. I bought this recording because of his presence and his voice. I already have PARSIFAL and I await with barely containable anticipation his Tristan and Siegfried. There is a very real danger to the tenor voice in assuming either role too early in one's career. I will be patient out of this necessity and have to content myself with his Don Jose (stunning!), Werther (brilliant!), Faust (wonderful!), and of course Parsifal (my absolute  favorite - second only to what I have heard Ramon Vinay sing). Anna Caterina Antonacci is an utterly convincing and memorable Carmen, and for once the toreador is sung with intelligence and acted with dignity by a virile, persuasive, golden-voiced Ildebrando D'Arcangelo.
Antonio Pappano conducts with his signature flair and precision; he is capable of conducting everything from Berg's LULU to Berlioz's LES TROYENS with great insight and great excitement. He has already made an perfectly pitched TRISTAN UND ISOLDE with Placido Domingo; someday, Maestro, you in the pit, Jonas Kaufmann on the stage and a TRISTAN for the ages!",1402099200,,2043,4.904624277456647
3499679,5,B001BWQVW2,"The story stands on it's own merit however, the ability of Jonas Kaufmann to bring the charater of Jose to life with his acting ability and the beauty and strength of his singing makes his performace my favorite.  The entire cast, stage setting and the orchester makes this a memorable DVD addition to my collection.",1401926400,,316,4.745454545454545
3499680,3,B001BWQVW2,"This is a period-adjusted version of the opera but is so well done that its acceptable. There are, however, problems. Whoever provided the audio mixing apparently felt that, at times, the orchestra should overwhelm the singing. There are moments when the orchestra is blasting and the singing is overwhelmed by it.

3499685,5,B001BWQVW2,"Bizet's music alone is a winner but I think that under Antonio Pappano's direction the orchestra gave it new vibrancy and vigor. The Royal Opera House Covent Garden really knows how to put on a show that grabs your attention from beginning to end. The cast was brilliant, the singing and acting skills, the intensity and energy of Anna Caterina Antonacci and Jonas Kaufmann were incredible and blew me away. I can't imagine a better production of ""Carmen"". In comparing it to the 1984 movie version of ""Carmen"" with Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes which I also like very much, I have to say that the ROH stage version on this DVD leaves the 1984 movie version (which was filmed in Andalusia and near Seville, Spain) in the dust. This DVD will also make great presents for family and friends, y'all. I'd give it 10 stars!",1382745600,2,822,4.636986301369863
3499686,2,B001BWQVW2,"After reading the many positive reviews, I was expecting a great performance. Unfortunately the Carmen, Anna Caterina Antonacci, does not have the voice or the power for the role. The direction of the opera seems to heavily rely on the display of Carmen's cleavage. The back of the DVD case states that Antonacci and Kaufmann bring rare exotic intensity to their roles. Bizet's music and the strength of the singing are what is paramount in any successful production to achieve this intensity. There is no great chemistry that I can detect between these two singers and their acting ability while better than average is not great. I do  not see what was the point of having Escamillo singing while mounted on a horse. The horse did not look happy and did not add to his strength or  his sexuality. Kaufman  as Don Jose has a strong voice which sounds much like a baritone with an extended top. The bottom of the voice is quite beautiful and I would probably be happy to hear him in the theatre in this role. It would be ideal for Wagner's Siegmund or Tristan. As for the present DVD, I do not plan on watching it again.",1377907200,5,1119,4.52970297029703

3499707,5,B001BWQVW2,"This is a very enjoyable production of a beloved opera. And what a marvelous opera it is! I had not heard ""Carmen"" in some years, and I was made newly aware of Bizet's inexhaustible melodic gift - literally every tune in the show is memorable.
I had liked Anna Caterina Antonacci as Cassandre (in ""Les Troyens""), and she is equally impressive as Carmen. Her character dominates the stage, and she uses all her resources to get whatever she wants - but without exaggeration or self-parody. She also sings beautifully. She sometimes plays fast and loose with the ryhthms and even comes unglued from the orchestra a couple of times; and her little runs in the Gypsy Song are less than clean. But these are minor blemishes in a fine performance. Jonas Kaufmann is certainly one of the best young tenors currently on stage. His Jos is a model of fine singing and convincing acting - he actually elicits our sympathy for this overgrown mama's boy! And he does a lovely diminuendo on the high note in the Flower Song. Norah Amsellem does what she can with Micala's character and displays a lovely lyric soprano. As Escamillo, Ildebrando D'Arcangelo looks good and has the proper swagger, but his singing is less impressive. His pitches are so foggy in the Toreador Song that it's fortunate that we all know the tune. He does improve, though. The smaller parts are very well cast, and the chorus sings well, looks good, and is well-involved dramatically. The French diction is surprisingly good, even in the spoken dialogue, though the native French speakers do stand out.
Antonio Pappano keeps things moving effectively, but he shows real affection for the music and a fine touch for Bizet's colorful orchestral writing.
I sometimes wonder if today's preponderance of abstract sets is due more to artistic vision or budgetary constraints. This one, made up of terracotta slabs, is reasonably effective. The costumes are in the right period and look good. There are some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments, like the introduction of a burro or horse in each act. Jos's approaching Escamillo by rappelling down a wall has to be a first.  Strongly recommended.",1345680000,3,2154,4.917582417582418
3499708,5,B001BWQVW2,"Not much doubt this is the sweatiest, most obsessive version of Carmen out there.  I found it to be the equal (except of course for the Spanish landscape) of the Migenes-Domingo version (I never believed in Domingo as an obsessive, you really believe in Kaufmann from the word go -- he is Navarrese in a way that Domingo never is).  Some reviewers don't really respond to Antonacci, but as an object of obsession, she is pretty terrific. The only slight distraction is the constant wondering if she is going to fall out of the top of her dress,  but it is an appropriate wondering, if you get my drift.

Everything about this production is great.  I particularly liked the physicality, the women washing themselves, people rappeling down walls, the knife fight.",1330992000,2,761,4.778625954198473
3499709,5,B001BWQVW2,"I have always loved Bizet's Opera ""Carmen"", and this DVD from Covent Garden London is a phantastic production. Anna Caterina Antonacci is a fabulous Carmen, and Jonas Kaufmann, the best tenor on earth, delivers a super performance. His voice is breathtakingly beautiful, and his acting makes you forget that you are watching a DVD, you think and feel as if everything is really happening right in your livingroom. Wonderful!!",1327622400,2,425,5.173913043478261
3499710,3,B001BWQVW2,"Sadly, I found this Royal Opera House production a bit disappointing.  Jonas Kauffmann has one of the best tenor voices around today and his fine acting makes any role he tackles utterly believable.  He's versatile, too, taking on anything from Wagner to Schubert.  One of my greatest treasures is his recording of The Pretty Miller's Daughter and I think he makes a pretty fine Don Jose, too, yet there is something lacking, despite the intensity he brings to the role and his gorgeous rendition of the flower song.  And who the hell made him pull his hair back in that unbecoming way during the early scenes?  Now we know that he's got ears like Prince Charles, rather detracting from his sex appeal!  Speaking of which, Anna Caterina Antonacci's Carmen is sizzling with it - a little too much so in my opinion.  She's rather coarse and vulgar, with none of the subleties portrayed by Julia Migenes-Johnson in the same role.  Antonacci's Carmen might well arouse lust in a lonely young soldier, but hardly undying love. A tart without a heart! She sings well enough, but her voice is unremarkable - not a patch on Elina Garanca in the recent (ish)NY Met production.  Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is an okay though slightly spivvish Escamillo and Norah Amsellem's golden voice and sensitive acting make her a very fine Micaela - actually I thought she was the best thing in it!  Neither the conductor (Antonio Pappano) nor the concert master (Peter Manning) seemed quite on top of their game - the choral bits were sloppy and much of the stage movement, too, was a bit cumbersom.  Somehow, the crowd scenes were not quite convincing and those annoying children were over-used!  I wasn't keen on the costumes, either - they just weren't quite right, compared with previous productions.  I don't hate this production by any means but if you want the definitive Carmen and Don Jose go for Julia MJ with Placido Domingo (quite wonderful in the role, though this is an old production) or the much newer NY Met production with Elina Garanca and Roberto Allagna (he doesn't sing it well but he looks the part).",1322611200,12,2098,4.778393351800554
3499711,5,B001BWQVW2,"Signorina Antonacci is indeed a very good Carmen, but the star of this performace is Jonas Kaufmann. In all my years of opera going, stage or film,I have not seen a Don Jose quite like this young man. He just doesn't sing or play this role, he becomes Don Jose. His performance is the one by which I will measure all the Don Joses to come.
In the last scene of the opera, when he enters through that small door to face Carmen,with that smile on his face, you know that this man has gone beyond the point of no return, that face tells it all.
During the final encounter, the interaction was so real that I feared that he will actually do her physical harm.
Great stage coreography! This Carmen is a Carmen performance for the ages. I think that this is the first time that I have teared at the end of Carmen, not for Carmen, but Don Jose,so amazing was his portrayal of this broken man!
The rest of the cast was excellent. Norah Ansellem was a very believable Micaela and the Escamillo was right on target. I like the production, I recently saw the same production in 3-D at the movies with a different principal cast.
I am looking forward to see Jonas Kaufmann in December at the Metropolitan HD presentation of Faust.
I have become a fan,I see him as a cross between Corelli and Carreras at their prime. Let wish him a long career.",1317513600,15,1332,4.332
3499712,5,B001BWQVW2,"Esta es la mejor versin montada escnicamente que he visto hasta ahora de la ms popular y conocida de todas las peras. Carmen la pera maestra del compositor francs George Bizet pocas veces haba sido representada con tanto candor y fuerza de erotismo como podemos apreciar en esta versin producida por el Royal Convent Garden de Inglaterra. La mezzosoprano dramtica Anna Caterina Antonacci si bien no posee la voz ms impresionante entre otras Carmen como ha sido el caso de Mara Callas, Tatiana Troyanos, Agnes Balza o Teresa Berganza por mencionar algunas famosas que han interpretado a la sensual gitana andaluza, nos impresiona por su gran carisma escnico capaz de dar todo lo mejor propio del carcter sexual de la protagonista. El tenor Jonas Kaufmann interpreta con mucha pasin masculina y su voz se adapta muy bien al personaje militar de la armada. El bartono Ildebrando D'Arcangelo tambin posee la fuerza ertica del amante que busca el amor de Carmen y realiza su papel con mucha naturalidad. La soprano lrico Norah Amsellem es una agradable Micaela muy segura y metida en su papel con mucha seguridad y dominio. La escenografa y coreografas nos trasladan a la Andaluca del siglo XIX con mucha elegancia y naturalidad como pocos montajes logrados de esta fascinante pera de Bizet. La Orquesta y Coros del Royal Opera House del Convent Garden de Londres cantan y actan con gran profesionalismo y de la mejor calidad escnica. La grabacin en HD est bien lograda y no hay nada ""cojo"" en la filmacin de cada escena. Excelente produccin!

3499713,5,B001BWQVW2,"This Carmen is conducted by Pappano with speedy tempi, which the Royal Opera House Orchestra responds to well. Listen to the Act I prelude, I have not heard this opening played so fast before. The Staging is traditional, with orange walls, which has a green tree, and deep blue sky matching the tonal value of the orange. The Costumes are traditional, set in the Spain of the time of the opera. Micaela, Norah Amsellem is not your usual doormat, but a strong  country woman,who you assume would put Don Jose in his place if they married. Ansellem would make a good Carmen. I originally obtained this Carmen only to hear Kaufmann in the role of Don Jose. I was prejuiced against the Carmen Antonacci, because she was miscast as Cassandra in the DVD of Berlioz's The Trojan's. Her voice was then too light. However, over the years her voice has deepened, because she is older. She is better then I expected. She is a good actress,and becomes the Gypsy, who approaches sex like a man. She is raw and seems rough. She does not have the sheer physical beauty of Ewing, who in this part almost becomes a mezzo. Ewing's Carmen has a sense of humour, which Antonacci does not. You can understand why men are attracted to Ewing. However, Antonacci, makes Carmen dangerous, a women whom men can relate to. Don Jose is out of his depth, being a country boy,who becomes obsessed by Carmen. You can see Kaufmann gradually becoming unhinged in his desire for Carmen, so good is his singing and acting. He sings the best flower song I have heard for a long time.

Escamillo comes on the stage sitting on a live horse. D'Arcangelo starts off slowly ,but as soon as he is off the horse,he sings the part very well. The other parts are well taken. I remember what Thomas Beecham once said about a production of a opera, when a horse did his business on the stage. He stated, that the horse made an excellent comment about the production. Throughly recommended.",1315526400,5,1942,4.577586206896552
3499714,4,B001BWQVW2,"Visually exciting, emotionally intense, wonderfully acted. Antonacci is wonderful to watch. The voice is very good, not great, but her performance as a whole is first rate. Kaufmann is superb, both vocally and with total immersion into the character. This is a production we will probably never see in the US but is worth watching here. Recommend.",1308528000,3,347,5.105263157894737
3499715,5,B001BWQVW2,"A Carmen to Behold!. This applies for both the entire production and cast!
Anna Caterina Antonacci, although obviously older than Jonas Kaufmann, embodies the soul of Bizet's Carmen. She is Carmen! (and she can sing very well too).
Jonas Kaufman, as already praised by many reviewers, is also superb - both in vocalizing and acting abilities. Norah Amsellem emotes and sings as if she were the real Micaela. Antonio Pappano is excellent, with just the right oomph or tenderness when required. I would have preferred a bolder Escamillo than Ildebrando DiArcangelo. The supporting cast and chorus are excellent. The direction and cinematography are excellent. The sets and costumes appropriate. The DVD comes in a Blu Ray edition which I would highly recommend.

She exudes intensity, but I was afraid that she would fall out of her gypsy dress! Jonas Kauffman has an incredible voice. I also like the MetOpera version with Elina Garanca and Roberto Alagna. Both are great gems for your collection!",1288828800,3,358,4.885245901639344
3499719,4,B001BWQVW2,"First of all, the women's choir are great and strong. The Carmen, by Ms. Antonacci is very impressive, even though I have not seeing other's performance. My personal favorite singing is the opera is Toreador. Such a handsome voice. Though, every single singer that I had heard to singing the Toreador Song has sorts of 'tempi' problem. Especially at the very beginning of this song. They are all naturally slowing down probably because need time to open the voice. And the low register are very difficult for them too.

The Conductor, Pappano is one of my favorite conductor for romantic style music. He has fire!

I also really enjoyed their 'Gypsy' dance; They are all very participative.

Enjoy.",1280707200,3,698,4.898305084745763
3499720,3,B001BWQVW2,"Jonas Kaufman is superb, both in terms of singing and acting. Anna Antonacci looks good and acts well as Carmen, but her singing lacks power. This especially makes the final scene not very satisfactory, despite the fine performance of Jonas. The tension and emotion are missing.

I am not an expert on the different versions of the opera, but noticed that the ""market chorus"" scene is missing in the final act. The first act duet between Micaela and Don Jose is also shortened.

I have the Agnes Baltsa/Jose Carreras Metropolitan Opera version, in my opinion much better overall than this one. There is so much more intensity and emotions in the final scene that I find myself sitting on the edge of the sofa sometimes.",1261612800,30,719,4.744
3499721,5,B001BWQVW2,"I loved every bit of this production (nearly, that is). It is of the highest standard in terms of singing, acting, costumes, staging etc... I have not found any other commercial DVD which is comparable. Antonacci is a very good Carmen, though not outstandingly so. Amongst the other notable DVDs, Ewing's, despite her consummate acting, is marred by somewhat ill-disciplined singing, Migenes and Bumbry had to lip-synch for their respective (otherwise fantastic) versions, while Baltsa and Berganza have rather unsuitable temperaments for Carmen, and Amparan sang in Italian. And Kaufman is probably the best Jose, amidst keen competition (including Corelli, Vickers, Domingo, Carreras, Luis Lima). D'Arcangelo is better than most Escamillos, though he must yield to Samuel Ramey. Ansellem is a typical, not very exciting, Micaela.

But was the dialogue between Zuniga and Carmen missing in the beginning of Act 2? He was supposed to invite her out, right? Also, the festive opening number in Act 4 was also missing. I certainly did not like the cuts. Four and a half stars perhaps.",1261267200,4,1082,5.254335260115607
3499722,5,B001BWQVW2,"What a smash hit this DVD is although my expectations were high, I never thought it would be this good.  The direction is natural and Antonacci's interpretation is the darkest and most fatalistic portrayal I've ever seen.  Forget about all the cliches like the hands on the swinging hips and other boring devices used over and over again.

Jonas Kaufmann, who is coming into his own as a major star, does not disappoint. His passagio from the lower voice to ringing top is something I have not heard in a tenor for a long, long time.

I have to admit Pappano is my favorite conductor among the younger generation of conductors.  He truly conducts for the singers and his orchestras always simply sing the music.",1259798400,5,711,4.656
3499723,4,B001BWQVW2,"I'm fairly new to opera so take my review with a grain of salt.  I have seen the wonderful Carlos Saura film, Carmen, which is based on the opera.  That absolutely blew me away and I heartily recommend it.  So I was set for some a high voltage performance here.  Perhaps my expectations were too high as I found the first few acts of the opera a little slow.  I kept thinking, ""Is this the English version of a Frenchman's view of Spaniards?""

I loved the sets and cotumes and found the staging and lighting very lovely.  The supporting cast was good.  The gypsey group was particularly interesting in that they seemed to have been chosen for their good looks as well as their singing ability.  This makes for an enjoyable viewing experience.  The children were adorable!

I guess that, after a lifetime of seeing films I am expecting to see attractive people and good acting although I certainly realize that vocal ability is the first thing to consider in an opera star. It was for this reason that I was less than entranced by the performance of Anna Caterina Antonacci.  When I was in acting school we were warned against playing one quality over and over.  I wish someone would have given Ms. Antonacci this advice.  She plays ""lusty"" over and over.  We certainly get the idea especially with her very low cut blouses, but after a while I found her performance boring.  I saw nothing of Carmen's real nature---Did she ever really love Don Jose? Why did she lose interest in him? Did she really love Escamillo?  Was she capable of loving anyone?  She is portrayed as such a one-dimensional stereotype that I really lost interest in her.  Probably what annoyed me the most was her constant sneering expression.  There were a few brief moments, mostly in the opening scene, in which she showed a full smile and she was truly beautiful then.  She is not physically that beautiful; many of the other gypsey girls were a lot prettier, so it seems that she should have shown some sort of sparkle or charisma to get these men to risk their lives for her. I think that this type of ""acting"" is right for stage performances where projecting large emotions is necessary, but when one films it, we need to see the smaller, more subtle facial expressions.  This is what Kauffman did so well and what Antonacci failed to do.

Kauffman was sensational! This is a performer who can act as well as sing.  His facial expressions are wonderful, from the beginning when he discounts the antics of the wiley Carmen, throughout the opera as we see him descend into near madness at his passion for her.  He was thorougly convincing as a real person, and won my heart so that at the final scene, when he kills Carmen, I wept for him.  For her...good riddance.  The final scene between the two of them is rivetting, due mostly to his performance.

I fell in love with Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Figaro in The Marriage of Figaro with Anna Netrebko, so I was pleased to see him here as Escamillo.  This role suits his wonderful good looks and deep voice and he plays the part of the dashing toreodor to a tee.
The duel between Don Jose and Esmaillo was one of the best scenes in the opera for me.

The final two acts are when the plots thickens and things heat up so I have to say that I did enjoy it.  If there had been a more sympathetic Carmen it would have been a total smash. Maybe Anna Netrebko?",1250812800,10,3378,4.488524590163935
3499724,5,B001BWQVW2,"A obra prima de Bizet tem nova produo,  do teatro londrino Covent Garden. Minha primeira Carmen em vdeo foi gravada naquele teatro. A ""bocuda"" Maria Ewing e Luis Lima fizeram o par romntico naqueles tempos.
Produes envelhecem, e hoje temos uma nova leitura dessa pera. Digo de antemo que vai ser difcil descrever a riqueza de detalhes desse vdeo.  A produo opta por uma verso verista da pera, violncia e amor, lado a lado, explodem nos personagens a cada segundo. Lilas Pastia transformado em uma taverneira; nas danas espanholas do segundo ato temos umas gordinhas sacanas que danam. Melhor que bailarinas magricelas. As cores evocam o laranja, escuras. A luz segue a mesma trilha, os figurinos acertados mostram a rudeza e a classe social dos personagens. A verso apresentada  da Opera Comic, ou seja, com os dilogos falados. Bem amarrados e estruturados, do coerncia e fluncia  pera. Os contrabandistas chegam a fazer piada dos ingleses.
  O diretor faz uma leitura pessoal da obra. Don Jos aparece no ""xilindr "",  na abertura do primeiro ato, com  cara de arrependido e tendo na mo a flor que a Carmen lhe jogara:  conta-se o fim no incio da pera. Movimenta os persongens, d dinmica e os faz atuar. No entendo o porqu de ter cortado a primeira cena do quarto ato. Concordo que ela no acrescenta nada  trama, mas a msica  de uma beleza incontestvel.
  Anna Caterina Antonacci  um dos melhores mezzos-sopranos da atualidade. Conheci sua voz e sua atuao em Les Troyens,  de Berlioz, e foi amor  primeira vista. Sua Carmen explode em fortes emoes, sempre est no limite. Apaixonada , volvel, violenta, independente e fogosa. Essas so algumas caractersticas que ela expressa com uma voz escura, graves generosos, volumosos e maravilhosa atuao cnica. Ao seu lado est Jonas Kaufmann, tenor de voz potente:  faz um Don Jos violento, obcecado pela cigana, que larga tudo por amor a ela e quebra a cara. Como diz Escamilo, os amores da Carmen duram seis meses, no mximo.
  Norah Ansellem faz uma Micela esperta demais. Sempre vi essa personagem como inocente, no frescor da juventude e inocncia. Sua voz  demasiado escura e pesada para a pobre garota do interior que quer se casar. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo  bartono das antigas, os graves predominam. Vozeiro possante, msculo, vibrante. Seu Escamilo tem a cara do persongem. J vi muitos escamilos gordinhos e passando da idade para um toureiro. Nesse papel,  meu preferido ainda  o bartono brasileiro Paulo Szot.
  A regncia de Antonio Pappano reala as cores e os detalhes da partitura. Tempos corretos e uma orquestra experiente de msicos levam a uma audio agradvel. Som e imagens de gravao digital sempre so muito bons, esse caso no foge  regra. Faltaram os extras, como entrevistas com os cantores e diretores e como foi feita a produo. Se vc gosta da pera Carmen,  tem que assistir a esse vdeo, vai virar referncia.

3499725,5,B001BWQVW2,"Astonishing performances from the two central leads makes this the most dramatically impressive performance on DVD, in my opinion. If you are looking for musicality and dramatic intensity of the highest order - which lifts this old warhorse out of the realm of sentimental cliche into a sphere akin to tragedy - then this is the one. The set is a very striking burnished orange and gold, the costumes have an authentic period look stripped of any glitzy romanticism. This may not be to everyone's taste but I found the overall effect to be very satisfying dramatically. Every now and then a production comes along that enables you to experience a classic piece as if for the first time. This is what Kaufman (the finest Don Jose on stage today) and Antonacci have done for me with this Carmen, to the point where I barely noticed any limitations of the production.",1239494400,16,864,4.728476821192053
3499726,5,B001BWQVW2,"I was unfamiliar with the cast when I purchased the DVD; however, as I began watching it I knew the cast was perfect.  The Soprano has a full voice, perfect for the role of Carmen - the gypsy who loves randomly.  Micaela is also superb, singing with emotion in her voice.  Don Jose fit into the role well, displaying many emotions, lust, temptation, anger, jealousy, betrayal, honor and the loss of honor, and love for Micaela and his mother!  Escamillo is a drop dead gorgeous bull fighter who can also sing.  You can realize Carmen's desire to drop Jose and take up Escamillo.

To me, the nice thing about watching an opera on DVD is close-ups with facial expressions.  The great acting along with the voices, the music and simple but effective scenery all work to make this great opera.  The direction was flawless.  Even with a stage full of performers, everyone knew where to be and what to be doing.  The choruses were well rehearsed and sang clearly and on key.  The orchestra and conductor likewise are professionals and presenting a great performance for them is expected.  At Covent Garden as at the Met, we come to expect nothing less.  BRAVO!",1236816000,5,1154,4.653465346534653
3499727,5,B001BWQVW2,"This is a thrilling and sultry performance of one of the most popular operas in the repertoire. Antonacci looks sexy, as the gypsy should, and sings very well, with just the right amount of smoky darkness in her voice.  Amsellen has a very nice lyric soprano and portrays a determined Micala. D'Arcangelo may  not be singing many Escamillos -he doesn't seem to be comfortable in the role-, but sounds good and has a very handsome presence. But the real star of the evening is Jonas Kauffman, in a spellbinding performance of Don Jose, beautifully sung, combining sweet and desperate tones, dramatically involved and fullfilling all the demands of the role as no other tenor in living memory. This is a tenor to watch. A true artist. The production looks messy at times but is not bad. The orchestra plays beautifully. The HD picture and the sound are both excellent. A Carmen to treasure.",1236470400,8,888,4.7973856209150325
3499728,4,B001BWQVW2,"Having read the fifteen wonderful reviews here, especially the one by 'ravennamoon' which mentions the Agnes Baltsa performance from the Met and the Zeffirelli staged one from the Verona Arena starring Marina Domashenko (both of which I own), I decided to go ahead and purchase this latest one from Covent Garden featuring Anna Caterina Antonacci. This Decca recording is very impressive as are all of the singers. The orchestra from the first beat of the most well known overture in opera to the curtain falling at the end and under the baton of Antonio Pappano is wonderful to listen to. The costumes are colorful and the lighting is exquisite.

Most productions from Covent Garden are generally less spectacular than those from the Met but, in this one, the cost cutting is extremely evident. The same backdrop is present from the beginning of Act 1 to the end of Act 4, whether it is meant to represent the outside of the cigarette factory, the interior of the tavern, a camp on a desolate mountain pass or outside of a bullring. While many designers are able to disguise to a certain extent by set-dressing the fact that the background is the same throughout, this is not present here. On another point, although the chorus and extras are quite large in number and reasonably well choreographed, the presence of only one small donkey and one horse and only a few matadors and toreadors do not create much spectacle during the arrival of the men about to enter the bullring.

I wish that I could be as full of praise as the other reviewers, however, when viewing this opera one is aware that while many of the ingredients are of the highest quality some are not up to the standard that I, as a Brit living overseas, expect from Covent Garden. This is a fine recording of a good opera that, if a little more money could have been spent, might well have been one of the very best versions of this popular work.",1235606400,10,1912,4.620588235294117
