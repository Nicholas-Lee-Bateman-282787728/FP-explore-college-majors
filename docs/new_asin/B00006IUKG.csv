7969683,5,B00006IUKG,This a great little Kung Fu movie from the 80s. Has some great action scenes in it and a pretty good story...,1355011200,,109,4.0
7969684,4,B00006IUKG,"This is one of the best Martail Arts films to have ever been released by the People's Republic of China, featuring the National Wushu Champion of China, Chiu Jan Kwo and incorporates some of the most awesome Shaolin fighting scenes ever captured on film as well as impressive swordplay and lethal weapon fighting by some of China's greatest martial arts masters and champions; one of the few from the People's Republic that actually involved a big budget contrary to the trend during that period of time and is, today, revered as a cult classics.

Highly recommended.",1351900800,,567,4.90625
7969685,4,B00006IUKG,"A good, but not pretentious, movie.  The action sequences are solid and do not attempt to be too flashy.  This film and its sequel are worthwhile additions to one's DVD library.",1178409600,,177,4.67741935483871
7969686,5,B00006IUKG,"If you like wushu, get this movie.  its amazing.  a true test of the knowledge of a martial arts film fan is how they rate this movie.  If you like actors pretending to be martial artists, being yanked around on strings with 2 second cuts,  this movie is NOT for you.

if you like a movie full of REAL talented wushu athletes from China, with LONG fight sequences (upwards of 20-30 seconds! believe it or not!) demonstrating high difficulty moves... this movie is for you.

The story is a bit rudimentary,  the dragon boating scenes are a bit boring (unless you're a huge dragon boat fan maybe) but that is what the Fast Forward button is for...  its worth it for the fight scenes alone.",1095033600,8,687,4.44
7969687,5,B00006IUKG,"First off, I'd like to point out that I love acrobatic, wushu style of martial arts in movies.  If you are the same way, you will absolutely love this movie.

Although the story is boring, it is far from annoying due to the fact that this movie obvously has a higher budget than most kung fu films of the time not starring Jackie Chan.  It is a very easy film to watch, and the kung fu is spectacular.

Every person who performs martial arts in this movie is obvously very skilled at wushu, and the choreography is beautifully done.

BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!",1090972800,3,553,4.330097087378641
7969688,4,B00006IUKG,"i like the plot of this movie and the star actor along with a  few of the other actors, all are very interesting, there are  however a few boring moments in this film, so i couldn't give it  a five.",974073600,2,198,3.9
