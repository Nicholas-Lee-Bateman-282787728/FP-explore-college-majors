8570602,3,B00B0F4WDK,"Not a bad effort, but it does fail to truly capture the spirit of the original series. If you're like me, a die hard fan of the original series, you will get some enjoyment of this new series.. it was nice seeing it set in the modern era, and it was enjoyable seeing the machinations of Sir Humphrey, and the interplay between the characters. You just likely won't end up watching it again and again like with the original series.",1423440000,,430,4.3875
