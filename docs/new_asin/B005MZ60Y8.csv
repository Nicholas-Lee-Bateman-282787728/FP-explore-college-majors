8480046,5,B005MZ60Y8,"This is an incredible show!!  It came on ESPN for four weeks.  I watched every episode.  Kinda wish they'd have done more though because it was so inspirational. It focuses on runned down, poor high schools who haven't had a major upgrade either ever, or in a REALLY long time. It shows communities coming together to volunteer their services to make the high school facilities better.  The schools the focus on, are teams that haven't played on their football field in years because there was a high risk of getting hurt, there were kids getting beat up or were affraid to be outside after dark because there is NO lighting, an entire track team that has NO track to practice on, and they have to practice in the hallway without shoes on.  This is a great series!  And I hope ESPN creates more!
