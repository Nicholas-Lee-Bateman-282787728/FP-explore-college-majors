3065090,5,B0011FLGU6,"Peter Davison gives a great performance as ""Dangerous Davies"" with his ""I still want to give him a good blow to the head"" best friend, Mod, played by Sean Hughes. It's inspiring to see how motivated he is to get at the truth, even due to its sometimes detrimental effects. Great acting!",1215216000,,286,4.519230769230769
3065091,5,B0011FLGU6,"Peter Davison is superb, in this highly unusual series.

The supporting cast, too, are all highly enjoyable and convincing. The fact that Davison the hard working, plodding but, in the end brilliant detective, is such a wuss regarding his estranged wife, was brilliant in its conception. It is always good to have heroes who have Achilles heels!

This series is brilliant and extremely well directed. Everyone, who enjoys a good detective yarn and a genuine smile, should see it.",1214697600,9,479,5.050632911392405
3065092,4,B0011FLGU6,"I don't have any particular reason to give only 4 stars, not 5, other than general principles, I guess.  Liking All Creatures (and having seen Peter Davison in several other series, it's good to see him again in something fresh) and also liking Agatha Christie (Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, the interplay between Poirot and Hastings, etc.), this series (I have and have watched the previous three) is good from at least two perspectives from the getgo.  And it's well done to boot.",1214438400,,481,4.783132530120482

3065095,4,B0011FLGU6,"I have not watched Series 4 yet.  However.  My husband found it in keeping with previous Series, in that Peter Davison makes the series.  It isn't that the stories/mysteries are particularly special.  But Davies' character makes the Series (all of them through 4) worth watching.  I have watched Series 1 - 3 and enjoy his character immensely. Hope this helps.",1210464000,2,360,4.933333333333334
3065096,5,B0011FLGU6,"The Last Detective series involves real life situations which keep you on the edge of your seat.  The acting and production values are first rate.
There is none of the typical ""formula"" that many detective series seem to be hampered with.  There is a balance of violence to heart felt human emotions and even when the endings are not resolved always satifactory, there again, it is like real life.  Not all of life's problems and situations are wrapped up with a neat ribbon.  You are able to experiece the drama of looking in at what is happening around Detective Dangerous, the good the bad and the ugly.  Peter Davison, as Detective Dangerous is someone we can identify with for his humanity, humor, and his ability to handle his life in the police force,while holding on to his integrity. He is someone we root for and admire.",1209686400,8,830,4.657534246575342
3065097,5,B0011FLGU6,"Dangerous gets better and better. This set is Dangerous at this
finest. Sean Hughes, his sidekick is hilarious (it is hoped we will
be able to eventually find him in his own series). The background
music by Rupert Gregson-Williams and Alastair King is beautiful.
Another plus is you have on one disc three complete episodes and
on the other two complete episodes. This series is just another
of Britain's superb series.",1208304000,3,419,4.915492957746479
3065098,5,B0011FLGU6,"""The last detective. That's what you are, Dangerous -- the last detective I'll ever think of, unless it's a crap job, see? Then you'll be the first."" -- Rob Spendlove as Detective Inspector Aspinall, The Last Detective: Series 1

The Last Detective is a very popular television series in England, and the first volume of the fourth series is just being released tomorrow. Peter Davison plays Constable ""Dangerous"" Davies, the lowest man on the totem pole inside the detective division of the Willesden constabulary.
Davies is the British Rodney Dangerfield, getting no respect from anybody, neither his colleagues, his wife, nor the people he meets in the course of his duties. The series title comes from Dangerous' boss at the cop shop, whom all call Gov, or Governor. Gov is arrogant, quick to criticize Davies, and just as quick to give Davies' colleagues the better assignments. Gov and Dangerous are constantly at loggerheads because, although Dangerous is the office's patsy, he's also usually the one who picks up on the clues that the others miss, and who follows up on things that should have been followed up on, but weren't. He's also inevitably the one who figures out the perpetrator of the crime of each of the episodes. But Dangerous still gets no respect.
It doesn't come up in the five episodes on this DVD, but there's a good chance that Dangerous got his name because he's dangerous mainly to himself, constantly getting into embarrassingly funny situations at least once per episode. In the opening episode, ""Once Upon A Time On The Westway,"" less than five minutes into the action Dangerous is nearly impaled on the top of a fence he's trying to scale. One of the pointed iron bars manages to tear into his trousers and get him hung up, while the trio who broke into a produce warehouse pelt him with tomatoes, then run off, leaving him hanging there. Sixties and seventies rock music fans will recognize Roger Daltrey of The Who as one of the bad guys, a member of a criminal gang that Dangerous is investigating in connection with a diamond heist. The heist is overtaken by the gang boss being murdered in his own home, then the two cases merge into one.
The second episode, ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" is the story of what seems to be an accidental death. It quickly becomes a murder investigation, which leads to a two-decades old snuff film that everybody is quick to label a fake. Of course it turns out otherwise, drawing Dangerous even deeper into the mystery when he discovers a body buried in the cellar. Dangerous, in spite of his sometimes apparent fecklessness, rapidly narrows the field of suspects. The investigation takes still another turn when the primary suspect quickly becomes the next victim.
The third episode, ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Willesden,"" opens with a vaudeville type act on stage in a seedy little club. As they're going through their routine, one of them falls dead onstage. Again, it's thought to be a natural causes death until Dangerous takes the time to read the autopsy. The list of suspects is long because, in spite of being into his sixties, the dead comedian had an address book full of women's names in every city on his circuit. Not only does he have a string of girlfriends of all shapes, sizes, and colors, many of them are married, which only broadens the suspect list. Since the method used in the murder was poisoned wine, which he drank onstage, the field narrows somewhat. But it isn't until the last few minutes of the show that somebody who hadn't been a prime suspect is uncovered, again due to Dangerous's efforts.
Episode four, ""The Man From Montevideo,"" opens appropriately with Dangerous walking the small horse that he calls a dog, and being offered a new suit for a great price from the trunk of a man's car. When he shows his cop shop ID, the man takes off running. Dangerous gets his man, but during the chase the man's trunk is being picked clean, thereby blowing the arrest.
The real case for this episode begins right afterward, when the owner of a small fleet of limos gets his throat cut with a broken bottle. The episode closes with Dangerous and his buddy Mod chasing a sheep. In between is an attempted bribe, a bent cop, a threatening boss, and a secret about Mod. How we go from a slit throat to chasing a sheep on a football pitch is a story you'll have to watch. This particular episode was my favorite of the five.
The final episode is ""Dead Peasant's Society,"" and it opens with Dangerous doing a good deed, getting called a pig by the woman he helped, and getting his coffee and sandwich pinched in the process. A typical day for our fearless hero. The real action begins with the very next scene, which takes place in the same type of venue as the last episode closed: on another soccer field. Blood is spilled again, this time by a ceremonial dagger; there's a secret society; Dangerous sees his wife suspiciously leaving the house early, then meeting a strange man on two occasions; and Dangerous's boss is stabbed, as well.
Overall this series is well written, imaginative, and with the right degree of comedy and confusion mingled in. Highly recommended. Special features include an interview with Peter Davison, a Leslie Thomas biography and booklist, and cast filmographies.",1207785600,15,5288,4.754080522306856

3065118,5,B0011FLGU6,"As American as my wife and I are, living here in Minnesota, USA, we never thought that there could possible be any better shows to watch. Then we watched just one British made film, and we were hooked. We have been going from one British Detective series to the next one. Sometimes we even see the same actors appear, makes no difference. We have become hooked on British Detective series. We can't say one is better than another. They are all great. The Last Detective had us hooked right away. We notice that these detectives seldom carry any weapons, and they make it work. The Last Detective is a great show from the first episode to the last. This series even made us laugh. Funny times, yet very strong Detective work.  Excellent to watch. Enjoy it.",1479772800,2,755,4.551470588235294

3065122,4,B0011FLGU6,"This is not your normal detective, the man nicknamed ""Dangerous"" but the stories are well presented and the mysteries keep you going to the end which at times, has a surprise ending.  He is nicknamed ""Dangerous"" as he is a lot like the character of Colombo, the detective who is laughed at is never suspected of solving the case which Peter Davison, the star does admirably.  The only problem I had with the series is there is too much of his domestic life with his wife, who seems the wrong partner for this nice, kind, considerate husband that he is.  This is supposed to be about the Last Detective not a soap opera of which the wife constantly makes of her life with.  Sean Hughes, his loyal friend Mob is a fine co-patriot to Davison.  Great viewing if you are a detective fan.",1478995200,,782,4.440559440559441

He's a genuinely nice person who has a crummy job situation, but he's smart and has an instinct for solving murders.

I'm glad Dangerous got his happy ending.  A just okay final season of an otherwise excellent series.",1379376000,,275,5.2272727272727275
3065228,5,B0011FLGU6,This has been a great detective series and also interesting series dealing with personality issues and relationships. There is humor and there are also serious issues. It's a good balance sprinkled in between solving a criminal case. It has everything.,1379030400,,252,5.325
3065229,4,B0011FLGU6,As always a show with Davison keeps me smiling and watching.  The supporting cast in the Last Detective is superior as well.  The series casts Davison as the underdog but in my mind he's always the one on top.  Not a heavy detective series but the characters are quirky and engaging.  Good enetertainment.,1378339200,,305,4.69811320754717

3065237,4,B0011FLGU6,"A detective who marches to his own drummer--honest and still optimistic, Dangerous Davies always solves the cases no one else wants to touch. The plots are imaginative and well-paced. The only element I wonder about is the petty crooks who he seems to lose his dignity to at the beginning of each episode.

The characters are wonderful. His best friend, Mod, is his perfect foil and his alcoholic boss tries to do the right thing. He finally wins his wife's respect. Davies' optimism is justified.

Recommend it over the shoot-em-ups. The bumbler we all love to root for.",1377216000,,571,4.816326530612245

3065240,4,B0011FLGU6,"This is the last of the series and it's as good as the previous three.  The mysteries/investigations are not elaborate, but they require some detective work.  I like my mysteries to be a little more complicated so that it is why I'm giving this four stars.  The main characters, Dangerous and Mod, are what make the show.  Dangerous is a nice guy who finishes last, and Mod is from another planet.  He is so hilarious and so original.  This season, Mod is living with Dangerous and his wife, so that produces a few comedic scenes.  I will miss watching these two.",1376438400,,563,4.514851485148514

If he is in it, I'm watching. I liked the idea of a ""gentle"" detective, one who uses his head and people skills to solve mysteries rather than relying on blazing guns. The humor in the series is a nice touch, except that I got a little tired of his best friend Mod, whom I did not find humorous.",1375574400,,447,4.209302325581396

They call him Dangerous, because he appears to a mild mannered non-violent man. However he is also a very good detective and always solves the crime. Dangerous also has a messy personal life and an odd friend that make the story interesting too.

The crimes are good mysteries that don't always have the obvious solution. Of course I've also been fond of Peter Davison since I first saw him as Doctor Who, so I enjoyed seeing him play this character. This the last season I've watched and it is as good or better than the first one.",1366329600,,663,4.666666666666667

3065288,5,B0011FLGU6,"I stumbled onto The Last Detective as part of my exploration of every Britsh crime show I could find. I almost didn't watch beyond the first episode because I favor heavier fare and this felt rather like a redux of the Murder, She Wrote genre--relatively light in tone, a mystery to solve, a bit of humor and on to next week.

But I was wrong. The series *is* rather light. Mod is a gem, the pranks are funny, and we get a steady influx of episodic suspects that range from sinister to clownish. But beyond the mysteries two aspects of TLD make it special: the regular cast is spot on perfect and the writers had the sense to create arcs that continued throughout the series, giving it more than a one-and-done feel.

It is the characters and their relationships that drive the series through four seasons, and that keep the viewer coming back. Sure, the mysteries are fun and often titillating but it is Davies' plight and his relationships with Mod, Julie, DI Aspinall, WPC Kapoor and even those losers Pimlott and Barrett that hook you. Davies somehow manages to be victimized yet refuses to be a victim. He manages to be a good person when circumstances beg for him to turn foul. He believes in humanity when it tries to convince him he shouldn't. He respects others, even those who may not deserve it. That is to say, self doubts and all, he is okay with who he is in this world, a damn fine trait. He reminds me somewhat of Christopher Foyle from Foyle's War in that respect. I'd be honored to share a drink with either of them.

Only complaint: I could have used a few more seasons.",1356134400,13,1589,4.453608247422681

3065291,5,B0011FLGU6,"Having gone thru Campion with Peter Davison, I was not expecting a well written series. And when I heard the main character's name was ""Dangerous"" Davies, I thought ""o-boy, is this going to be corny"".  What I got instead was good acting, chemistry of characters and story lines 180 degrees out of line for the better than I had seen in Campion.  From the first series on it holds your interest from beginning to end. The Last Detective has a little of everything including pathos, expression of character, chemistry, and that little bit of frailty that is in all of us.  But above all, the best is just the right amount of humor and ""one-liners"" that makes this series immensely enjoyable.  Although this last quality doesn't quite come off in the character Mod it certainly does in the Governor-Davis' chief superior.  He often steals the scenes and blends the perfect combination of cynicism, wit, vulnerability and expression.  The continuing evolution of his character and that of Davis and his wife is wonderful and refreshing.
The Last Detective is typical of a British quality production that can never be duplicated in vulgar load ""noise"" of an American cop series whose maxim seems to be if we just keep using four-letter words and keep refering to people's genitals  we can win over an audience(unfortunately with vast American audiences, they seem to be right however).  What you want to do is get series I of the Last Detective first so you get a feel for the evolution of this fine production....Now, if they could only speak English...just kidding.  Although some of the characters outside of ""Dangerous"" Davis himself has a vernacular as thick as a West Virginian, you ""will"" be able to understand what they are saying, trust me.

I suppose Davies' biggest problem, at least as relates to workplace advancement and marital harmony, is his innate kindness. He is very thoughtful, compassionate and tolerant towards all, perhaps too much so. His impatient and frankly unfaithful wife (who doesn't deserve him), finds him lacking in the excitement department. His quirky chum Mod, although charming, takes Davies for granted. Davies' often boorish police colleagues mistake his quiet demeanor for lack of skill. It is refreshing to see such a laid-back yet successful (at least in terms of solving cases) law enforcement officer.  An enormously unique and satisfying series.",1237248000,3,888,5.875968992248062

It debuted in the U.K. in February 2003, and offers a light-hearted blend of mystery and comedy similaRosemary ar to that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Murder-Set-4/dp/B001O7R772/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Murder: Set 4</a>;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-Thyme-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000WCN7M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series</a>.  It's based on the ""Dangerous Davies"" novels of Leslie Thomas.  This release consists of a two-volume boxed set including five all-new, full-length police procedurals, but, unfortunately, does not come equipped with subtitles, so good luck with the North London accents.

Peter Davison (Tristan, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Series-1-Collection/dp/B000062XDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection</a>); stars as Detective Constable (only a constable: quite a disgrace!!) in the totally unimportant, totally out of the way North London precinct of Willesden.  He's the last detective his boss would ever willingly assign to a case, and he gets the least promising ones, but he generally does get his man - or woman, as the case may be.  He's a rumpled, galumphing sort, of average looks and seemingly average brain, but he loves his job, and is good at it.  In series 4, his luck has taken a turn for the better: his wife Julie (Emma Amos) has taken him back, though she finds she has to share her house with Mod, his freeloading,quirkster chum (Sean Hughes,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/6305622922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>.)  Hughes brings a lot to his part; it must be said, just as his character brings a lot to the mix:  he's much more than just a sounding board.

Episode 1, ""Once Upon a Time on the Westway."" Jimmy (the Gentleman) Vincent, former major crime boss, gets out of jail, and seems to be involved in a daring diamond heist on the same day.  He is soon, however, found floating dead in his pool.  This episode co-stars Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, in a sizable part, with which he does well.  It's full of charm, and paints a lovely, nostalgic, I'm afraid, picture of the London underworld, as it was supposed to be before Jamaican posses, Chinese tongs, and Russian Maffias.

Episode 2, ""Dangerous Liaisons.""  The two-week old corpse of reclusive former architect Dominic Sylvester is found, and everyone but Davies assumes it's just business as usual; until, that is, Davies finds a homemade snuff film among the family movies.  Hywel Bennett(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B00006A8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>) co-stars here, looking, oh well, nothing like his once-upon a time pretty boy self.

Episode 3, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Willesden.""  Bunny Hopper, half of the once almost famous comedy team Bunny & Jules, literally dies onstage in a bingo hall, and what a way to go.  But the postmortem says he'd been poisoned, and, as it soon becomes clear that, true to his nickname, Bunny had led a very busy love life, Davies has plenty of interviewing to do.

Episode 4, ""The Man from Montevideo.""  Limo owner Tony Hill is dispatched by being slashed with a broken champagne bottle, an unfortunate end for an ex-pat just back from Uruguay to try to rebuild an English life.  Davies soon finds there's a little matter of a missing two million English pounds in the dead man's past.

Episode 5, ""Dead Peasant's Society."" The finding of the body of a man dead behind the wheel of his car, on a soccer pitch, brings Davies to the Lodge of Divine Serenity, a secret, exclusive, all-male society.  Here he finds Leslie Phillips (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chancer-Series-1/dp/B000P2A2WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chancer - Series 1</a>,) doing his best to impersonate a toff.

The Last Detective is a very popular television series in England, and the first volume of the fourth series is just being released tomorrow. Peter Davison plays Constable ""Dangerous"" Davies, the lowest man on the totem pole inside the detective division of the Willesden constabulary.
Davies is the British Rodney Dangerfield, getting no respect from anybody, neither his colleagues, his wife, nor the people he meets in the course of his duties. The series title comes from Dangerous' boss at the cop shop, whom all call Gov, or Governor. Gov is arrogant, quick to criticize Davies, and just as quick to give Davies' colleagues the better assignments. Gov and Dangerous are constantly at loggerheads because, although Dangerous is the office's patsy, he's also usually the one who picks up on the clues that the others miss, and who follows up on things that should have been followed up on, but weren't. He's also inevitably the one who figures out the perpetrator of the crime of each of the episodes. But Dangerous still gets no respect.
It doesn't come up in the five episodes on this DVD, but there's a good chance that Dangerous got his name because he's dangerous mainly to himself, constantly getting into embarrassingly funny situations at least once per episode. In the opening episode, ""Once Upon A Time On The Westway,"" less than five minutes into the action Dangerous is nearly impaled on the top of a fence he's trying to scale. One of the pointed iron bars manages to tear into his trousers and get him hung up, while the trio who broke into a produce warehouse pelt him with tomatoes, then run off, leaving him hanging there. Sixties and seventies rock music fans will recognize Roger Daltrey of The Who as one of the bad guys, a member of a criminal gang that Dangerous is investigating in connection with a diamond heist. The heist is overtaken by the gang boss being murdered in his own home, then the two cases merge into one.
The second episode, ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" is the story of what seems to be an accidental death. It quickly becomes a murder investigation, which leads to a two-decades old snuff film that everybody is quick to label a fake. Of course it turns out otherwise, drawing Dangerous even deeper into the mystery when he discovers a body buried in the cellar. Dangerous, in spite of his sometimes apparent fecklessness, rapidly narrows the field of suspects. The investigation takes still another turn when the primary suspect quickly becomes the next victim.
The third episode, ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Willesden,"" opens with a vaudeville type act on stage in a seedy little club. As they're going through their routine, one of them falls dead onstage. Again, it's thought to be a natural causes death until Dangerous takes the time to read the autopsy. The list of suspects is long because, in spite of being into his sixties, the dead comedian had an address book full of women's names in every city on his circuit. Not only does he have a string of girlfriends of all shapes, sizes, and colors, many of them are married, which only broadens the suspect list. Since the method used in the murder was poisoned wine, which he drank onstage, the field narrows somewhat. But it isn't until the last few minutes of the show that somebody who hadn't been a prime suspect is uncovered, again due to Dangerous's efforts.
Episode four, ""The Man From Montevideo,"" opens appropriately with Dangerous walking the small horse that he calls a dog, and being offered a new suit for a great price from the trunk of a man's car. When he shows his cop shop ID, the man takes off running. Dangerous gets his man, but during the chase the man's trunk is being picked clean, thereby blowing the arrest.
The real case for this episode begins right afterward, when the owner of a small fleet of limos gets his throat cut with a broken bottle. The episode closes with Dangerous and his buddy Mod chasing a sheep. In between is an attempted bribe, a bent cop, a threatening boss, and a secret about Mod. How we go from a slit throat to chasing a sheep on a football pitch is a story you'll have to watch. This particular episode was my favorite of the five.
The final episode is ""Dead Peasant's Society,"" and it opens with Dangerous doing a good deed, getting called a pig by the woman he helped, and getting his coffee and sandwich pinched in the process. A typical day for our fearless hero. The real action begins with the very next scene, which takes place in the same type of venue as the last episode closed: on another soccer field. Blood is spilled again, this time by a ceremonial dagger; there's a secret society; Dangerous sees his wife suspiciously leaving the house early, then meeting a strange man on two occasions; and Dangerous's boss is stabbed, as well.
Overall this series is well written, imaginative, and with the right degree of comedy and confusion mingled in. Highly recommended. Special features include an interview with Peter Davison, a Leslie Thomas biography and booklist, and cast filmographies.",1207785600,15,5288,4.754080522306856

3299618,4,B0011FLGU6,"I love this series, and hope it goes on for many more episodes. It makes a change to find a detective who is a normal and decent person.",1478995200,,136,3.892857142857143
3299619,4,B0011FLGU6,"This is not your normal detective, the man nicknamed ""Dangerous"" but the stories are well presented and the mysteries keep you going to the end which at times, has a surprise ending.  He is nicknamed ""Dangerous"" as he is a lot like the character of Colombo, the detective who is laughed at is never suspected of solving the case which Peter Davison, the star does admirably.  The only problem I had with the series is there is too much of his domestic life with his wife, who seems the wrong partner for this nice, kind, considerate husband that he is.  This is supposed to be about the Last Detective not a soap opera of which the wife constantly makes of her life with.  Sean Hughes, his loyal friend Mob is a fine co-patriot to Davison.  Great viewing if you are a detective fan.",1478995200,,782,4.440559440559441
3299620,4,B0011FLGU6,"I was half way into the series before I realized I was watching Tristan, Cedric's younger brother from ""All Creatures Great and Small"" but who was now 30 years older in The Last Detective.  I enjoyed the series more as Dangerous Davies started to gain the respect of his fellow detectives. I will often watch really good Detective shows more then once but this show is good for only a one time view.",1478217600,,399,4.465753424657534

3299622,3,B0011FLGU6,"This show has progressed and held my interest primarily because I like the main character. He's a genuinely nice person who has a crummy job situation, but he's smart and has an instinct for solving murders. Gradually, he has developed confidence at work and at home and begun to take up for himself. I've enjoyed that. It's too bad that it took so long. I like him.",1477958400,,366,4.477611940298507

What a nice change of pace and very comical as well  I was so sorry more episodes weren't available.

3299723,5,B0011FLGU6,"I am always surprised (not) that the Brits surpass the Americans in pathos and  intelligence with intelligent. humor to soften the violent  underbelly of such drama . I like Peter Davison very much, HE UNDERACTS TO PERFECTION",1380412800,,225,5.054054054054054
3299724,3,B0011FLGU6,"It's the same old Dangerous Davies I loved from the earlier series, but compared to the previous series there was decidedly less personal conflict and character development.  I'm glad Dangerous got his happy ending.  A just okay final season of an otherwise excellent series.",1379376000,,275,5.2272727272727275
3299725,5,B0011FLGU6,This has been a great detective series and also interesting series dealing with personality issues and relationships. There is humor and there are also serious issues. It's a good balance sprinkled in between solving a criminal case. It has everything.,1379030400,,252,5.325
3299726,4,B0011FLGU6,As always a show with Davison keeps me smiling and watching.  The supporting cast in the Last Detective is superior as well.  The series casts Davison as the underdog but in my mind he's always the one on top.  Not a heavy detective series but the characters are quirky and engaging.  Good enetertainment.,1378339200,,305,4.69811320754717
3299727,5,B0011FLGU6,Great characters and very good acting makes for a series you can really get into. The icing on the cake is the mystery plots. A great detective series.,1378252800,,151,4.428571428571429

3299734,4,B0011FLGU6,"A detective who marches to his own drummer--honest and still optimistic, Dangerous Davies always solves the cases no one else wants to touch. The plots are imaginative and well-paced. The only element I wonder about is the petty crooks who he seems to lose his dignity to at the beginning of each episode.

The characters are wonderful. His best friend, Mod, is his perfect foil and his alcoholic boss tries to do the right thing. He finally wins his wife's respect. Davies' optimism is justified.

Recommend it over the shoot-em-ups. The bumbler we all love to root for.",1377216000,,571,4.816326530612245

Dangerous is a nice guy who finishes last, and Mod is from another planet.  He is so hilarious and so original.

They call him Dangerous, because he appears to a mild mannered non-violent man. However he is also a very good detective and always solves the crime. Dangerous also has a messy personal life and an odd friend that make the story interesting too.

The crimes are good mysteries that don't always have the obvious solution. Of course I've also been fond of Peter Davison since I first saw him as Doctor Who, so I enjoyed seeing him play this character.

3299785,5,B0011FLGU6,"I stumbled onto The Last Detective as part of my exploration of every Britsh crime show I could find. I almost didn't watch beyond the first episode because I favor heavier fare and this felt rather like a redux of the Murder, She Wrote genre--relatively light in tone, a mystery to solve, a bit of humor and on to next week.

But I was wrong. The series *is* rather light. Mod is a gem, the pranks are funny, and we get a steady influx of episodic suspects that range from sinister to clownish. But beyond the mysteries two aspects of TLD make it special: the regular cast is spot on perfect and the writers had the sense to create arcs that continued throughout the series, giving it more than a one-and-done feel.

It is the characters and their relationships that drive the series through four seasons, and that keep the viewer coming back. Sure, the mysteries are fun and often titillating but it is Davies' plight and his relationships with Mod, Julie, DI Aspinall, WPC Kapoor and even those losers Pimlott and Barrett that hook you. Davies somehow manages to be victimized yet refuses to be a victim. He manages to be a good person when circumstances beg for him to turn foul. He believes in humanity when it tries to convince him he shouldn't. He respects others, even those who may not deserve it. That is to say, self doubts and all, he is okay with who he is in this world, a damn fine trait. He reminds me somewhat of Christopher Foyle from Foyle's War in that respect. I'd be honored to share a drink with either of them.

Only complaint: I could have used a few more seasons.",1356134400,13,1589,4.453608247422681

Like how the detective's relationship with his wife and best friend are always evolving and a pleasant backdrop to the story.  This is a very satisfying series and just wish it had more series.  If you like British mysteries which aren't too grisly, this is a pleasant and realistic series.",1356048000,,578,4.896907216494846
3299787,5,B0011FLGU6,"For those of us who enjoy British TV, The Last Detective is a leisurely, entertaining series featuring some great characters and a common cop.  Dangerous Davies is given that name because he isn't - dangerous, that is.  No, he's the 'last detective' you'd call, hence the title, because he's too nice.  He gets little respect from his peers, his friend Mod and his wife (at times), but he always gets the job done and is a decent chap to boot.",1315872000,,443,4.5125
3299788,5,B0011FLGU6,"Having gone thru Campion with Peter Davison, I was not expecting a well written series. And when I heard the main character's name was ""Dangerous"" Davies, I thought ""o-boy, is this going to be corny"".  What I got instead was good acting, chemistry of characters and story lines 180 degrees out of line for the better than I had seen in Campion.  From the first series on it holds your interest from beginning to end. The Last Detective has a little of everything including pathos, expression of character, chemistry, and that little bit of frailty that is in all of us.  But above all, the best is just the right amount of humor and ""one-liners"" that makes this series immensely enjoyable.  Although this last quality doesn't quite come off in the character Mod it certainly does in the Governor-Davis' chief superior.  He often steals the scenes and blends the perfect combination of cynicism, wit, vulnerability and expression.  The continuing evolution of his character and that of Davis and his wife is wonderful and refreshing.
The Last Detective is typical of a British quality production that can never be duplicated in vulgar load ""noise"" of an American cop series whose maxim seems to be if we just keep using four-letter words and keep refering to people's genitals  we can win over an audience(unfortunately with vast American audiences, they seem to be right however).  What you want to do is get series I of the Last Detective first so you get a feel for the evolution of this fine production....Now, if they could only speak English...just kidding.  Although some of the characters outside of ""Dangerous"" Davis himself has a vernacular as thick as a West Virginian, you ""will"" be able to understand what they are saying, trust me.

3299791,5,B0011FLGU6,"Detective Constable ""Dangerous"" Davies, played with brilliant understatement by Peter Davison, is perhaps the british equivalent of America's ""Columbo"".  Disrespected by most, particularly his colleagues, Davies is a downright effective detective. I suppose Davies' biggest problem, at least as relates to workplace advancement and marital harmony, is his innate kindness. He is very thoughtful, compassionate and tolerant towards all, perhaps too much so. His impatient and frankly unfaithful wife (who doesn't deserve him), finds him lacking in the excitement department. His quirky chum Mod, although charming, takes Davies for granted. Davies' often boorish police colleagues mistake his quiet demeanor for lack of skill. It is refreshing to see such a laid-back yet successful (at least in terms of solving cases) law enforcement officer.  An enormously unique and satisfying series.",1237248000,3,888,5.875968992248062

This production was made by Granada for the United Kingdom's Independent Television (ITV).  It debuted in the U.K. in February 2003, and offers a light-hearted blend of mystery and comedy similaRosemary ar to that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Murder-Set-4/dp/B001O7R772/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Murder: Set 4</a>;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-Thyme-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000WCN7M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series</a>.  It's based on the ""Dangerous Davies"" novels of Leslie Thomas.  This release consists of a two-volume boxed set including five all-new, full-length police procedurals, but, unfortunately, does not come equipped with subtitles, so good luck with the North London accents.

Peter Davison (Tristan, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Series-1-Collection/dp/B000062XDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection</a>); stars as Detective Constable (only a constable: quite a disgrace!!) in the totally unimportant, totally out of the way North London precinct of Willesden.  He's the last detective his boss would ever willingly assign to a case, and he gets the least promising ones, but he generally does get his man - or woman, as the case may be.  He's a rumpled, galumphing sort, of average looks and seemingly average brain, but he loves his job, and is good at it.  In series 4, his luck has taken a turn for the better: his wife Julie (Emma Amos) has taken him back, though she finds she has to share her house with Mod, his freeloading,quirkster chum (Sean Hughes,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/6305622922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>.)  Hughes brings a lot to his part; it must be said, just as his character brings a lot to the mix:  he's much more than just a sounding board.

Episode 1, ""Once Upon a Time on the Westway."" Jimmy (the Gentleman) Vincent, former major crime boss, gets out of jail, and seems to be involved in a daring diamond heist on the same day.  He is soon, however, found floating dead in his pool.  This episode co-stars Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, in a sizable part, with which he does well.  It's full of charm, and paints a lovely, nostalgic, I'm afraid, picture of the London underworld, as it was supposed to be before Jamaican posses, Chinese tongs, and Russian Maffias.

Episode 2, ""Dangerous Liaisons.""  The two-week old corpse of reclusive former architect Dominic Sylvester is found, and everyone but Davies assumes it's just business as usual; until, that is, Davies finds a homemade snuff film among the family movies.  Hywel Bennett(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B00006A8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>) co-stars here, looking, oh well, nothing like his once-upon a time pretty boy self.

Episode 3, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Willesden.""  Bunny Hopper, half of the once almost famous comedy team Bunny & Jules, literally dies onstage in a bingo hall, and what a way to go.  But the postmortem says he'd been poisoned, and, as it soon becomes clear that, true to his nickname, Bunny had led a very busy love life, Davies has plenty of interviewing to do.

Episode 4, ""The Man from Montevideo.""  Limo owner Tony Hill is dispatched by being slashed with a broken champagne bottle, an unfortunate end for an ex-pat just back from Uruguay to try to rebuild an English life.  Davies soon finds there's a little matter of a missing two million English pounds in the dead man's past.

Episode 5, ""Dead Peasant's Society."" The finding of the body of a man dead behind the wheel of his car, on a soccer pitch, brings Davies to the Lodge of Divine Serenity, a secret, exclusive, all-male society.

Davies, as played by Davison, is a character that's easy to take, and so is his series.  He doesn't aim to set the world on fire; neither does the series.  But the time sure passes pleasantly.",1218499200,,4593,5.981651376146789

Generally speaking there is nothing on US television to compare with the British series.",1216512000,7,395,4.739130434782608
