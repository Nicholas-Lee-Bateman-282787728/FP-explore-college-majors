2168080,3,B00064AEZG,"I found this movie rather charming. It is a somewhat telenovela (aka soaps) inspired movie. The actors are known for the roles in Hispanic telenovelas. The story and the dialogue was cute. As cheesy romantic comedies go, this was ok. The actors are not very believable, but it actually seems that the movie was going for the cheesy side over-the-top romantic side of things. It is entertaining and I liked it. So don't have any high expectations and know that this is a Mexican telenovela-like movie.",1201996800,,500,4.825581395348837
2168081,4,B00064AEZG,"This movie is pretty silly.  Although Barbara Mori is a good actress, this movie is not on her best work list.  She plays her character well.  But, there's absolutely no point to the story.

This movie is simply the repetitive story of the clumsy geek getting the girl.  There you have it.  That's the plot, and that's the entire movie.

I think a better movie with Barbara in it is ""La Mujer de mi Hermano.""  I really enjoyed that one.",1186704000,3,436,4.3625
2168082,2,B00064AEZG,"I watched this because I love Barbara Mori, who is fine in this movie but not given much of an interesting part.  Most of it follows De La Torre as he mopes and moons over Mori's character and tries to conquistarla although she's entirely not interested.  Rather than coming off as sweet or funny, De La Torre just seems dorky (even more so than the suave ""nerd"" best friend, who is just skinny), annoying, and pathetic (and not that good-looking, although his character is supposed to be all that).  None of his stunts to try to win her over are all that outrageous or comical either.  In the ending, which defies believability, some cheap psychological mumbo-jumbo is supposed to win the girl over, although what she really ought to do is file a restraining order.",1154044800,2,766,4.651851851851852
2168083,4,B00064AEZG,"In the beginning I hesitated whether to buy the movie or not. But when I did. I was surprised in a good way. It is a sweet romantic movie. Although it is slow and the acting is not of an oscar material, but the story and the way that the movie was directed, would make you forget the above. I recommend this movie as it has comedy & romance.",1128902400,,341,3.9565217391304346
2168084,4,B00064AEZG,"Alright, well I thought this movie was really funny. I don't like chick flicks and this was def not one. The main character's friends are hillarious; really life-like...as in they would be any guy's best friends. They are always making fun of the main character and setting him up with horrible, annoying women. The movie was quite entertaining and not a waste of time. Watch it if you want to see a light comedy/romance movie. It's great!",1122940800,3,439,4.714285714285714
2168085,2,B00064AEZG,"'Inspiraci&oacute;n' isn't.  For those who have the patience to sit through this Mexican extended novella, discovering that other countries are capable of producing the kind of summer chick flick messes that Hollywood cranks out ad infinitum will be the surprising reward.  Written and directed by Angel Mario Huerta and starring a group of Mexican TV actors, 'Inspiraci&oacute;n' has little to recommend it.

A group of Macho guys (supposedly teenagers although all of the actors are obviously aged well beyond that!) with little on their minds except dating, doing the club scene, sporting wagers about girls as though the girls were game-things for goals, spur on the naive Gabriel (Arath de la Torre) to pursue a beauty he merely glimpses and gets a first name Alejandra (B&aacute;rbara Mori).  Gabriel in 'inspired' to write poetry (not a pastime appropriate to macho men...) in response to Alejandra, has a confrontation with his father that begins with the usual flair of son not living up to father ideals and ends with a complete reversal of tears and forgiveness..., and is rigged into assignation with his 'inspiration'.  Each move Gabriel makes to woo Alejandra results in disaster in situations intended to be humorous but that are really just gross or silly.

It is the old, tired story of boy meets girl, boy falls all over himself to impress, girl initially responds but is gradually repulsed by boy's insipid arrogance and behavior, boy looses hold on girl, and eventually boy gets girl. Yes, that is it!  The acting is almost as weak as the script and direction and while some of the actors are attractive people, they have no sense of comedy or love chemistry or charisma.  The film is overproduced, with more emphasis on d&eacute;colletage than on character development, and in the end the only saving grace is seeing Monterey, Mexico and surrounding areas to advantage.  Definitely a class B movie that probably should not have been exported.  92 long minutes in length and with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, July 05",1121558400,5,2039,5.038690476190476
2168086,2,B00064AEZG,"Beware! Watching this DVD will be a big waste of your time, unless, of course, you enjoy inane screenplays.  Not even Barbara Mori's good looks can redeem this turkey, which barely deserves 2 stars.  Que plomo!",1119744000,2,210,4.805555555555555
2168087,4,B00064AEZG,"This is a sweet little movie and I enjoyed it very much. That said, be warned that this DVD is not in it's original theatrical aspect ratio but in fullscreen format. The 16:9 ratio indicated on the disc is a misprint. This is not pan-and-scanned but apparently an open-matte version of the movie - not as bad as a pan-and-scan but still not the original aspect ratio which would have fit in nicely on a 16:9 TV.",1105660800,,411,4.35064935064935

She's not much interested in him. Barbara's role is a rich, mature girl in a big house with a maid that screens people who come to the door.",1294790400,,153,3.935483870967742
8038572,5,B00064AEZG,"If only Hollywood made movies like this! A fist fight is the worst thing there is in this movie and it's mild. This movie gets the point across without the Hollywood depravity of today's movies. It's light and it's almost a true comedy, but it certainly should serve as an inspiration to a few writers out there. We need more movies like this with a real message instead of the films with gratuitous elements thrown in to reach wider audiences like we see most often in American films.",1261699200,3,485,4.5227272727272725
