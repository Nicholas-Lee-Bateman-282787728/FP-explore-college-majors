2690448,2,B000KGGZT4,"i'm not a fan of the ""chitlin circuit"" plays, it was an unintentional purchase and i was affirmed in my dislike.  however, if you are not as picky, you may find it entertaining.",1187222400,,177,4.363636363636363
2690449,5,B000KGGZT4,"I loved this book so I was a bit wary to see this - however I was pleasantly surprised. As other reviews have mentioned the cast and the chemistry was excellent- they stayed true to the book and it did not give off the ""low budget vibe"". All in all- an excellent choice and a must see/ have.",1180396800,11,291,4.0344827586206895

2690451,5,B000KGGZT4,"The chemistry between these actors was great!  There were parts that made you laugh and made you cry, but you felt all of the joy and pain the characters allowed you to see!  I would recommend this play for anyone who enjoys seeing Tyler Perry or David Talbert.  It is not low budget and was filmed in a way that makes you feel like you are right there in the theater!  I applaud the realistic nature of the script and reaction of the actors!",1178496000,7,442,4.226190476190476

2690539,5,B000KGGZT4,"I love this movie! I thought it was well cast, and the acting was great! I think Mel Jackson is a very under noticed actor, and well Monica Calhoun I have loved her since What about your Friends movie, all in all this shows some of the highs and lows of getting involved too quickly, and understanding we must learn all we can first.  Then everything else will fall into place, especially if you are meant to be with that person.  I definitely recommend this movie!",1352073600,,465,4.395348837209302

2690542,2,B000KGGZT4,"I really didn't like this play I thought I was purchasing a movie. The characters are good, I like them in other movies, I just didn't like the play format.",1298851200,,156,4.233333333333333
2690543,5,B000KGGZT4,THIS PLAY WAS VERY FUNNY.  I LAUGHED FROM BEGINNING TO END.  LAVELLE CRAWFORD IS HILARIOUS.  I WAS PLEASED BY THE ALL STAR CAST WHO ALL PERFORMED EXTREMELY WELL. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE.,1288483200,,204,4.771428571428571
2690544,4,B000KGGZT4,Thank you amazon for the great deals on items. The play was good and the actors did a wonderful job. There is a good story line and the comedians were sooo funny. I would highly recommend this play.,1282003200,,198,4.2368421052631575
2690545,3,B000KGGZT4,First I must say that either I didn't read the movie description completely before I bought it or I must have been asleep.  This is not actually a movie but a play.  It was a little hard for me to follow and the story line was too involved.  The actors were very good but I just didn't like the play.,1277078400,,300,3.966666666666667
2690546,1,B000KGGZT4,Save your money this is the worst play I have seen in a long time. Good actors poor acting and terrible storyline. Need I say more?,1271289600,,131,4.076923076923077
2690547,1,B000KGGZT4,After reading the book years ago and falling in love with I decided to order the play... what a complete waste of money. The play is nothing like the book except for a few things. Overall I think this play was WACK... it would have been better as movie instead of a play where they could have followed the book the way it was written.,1262044800,,334,4.153846153846154
2690548,3,B000KGGZT4,"i feel they could've found better people to be in this play. to me they all sounded like they were reading right from the script, and it wasn't that funny. there were parts that Leon's character was screaming his lines, but it didn't make sense. it was ok, but could've been better.",1258848000,,282,4.4423076923076925
2690549,4,B000KGGZT4,"Before buying this movie make sure you know this is the play not the movie. I bought this thinking it was the movie.
Anyway this play is very good. While it is not T.P. it is a good story line. All thoguh it is common. Good to see. Funny and good actors.
Yes I would recommend.",1247788800,,277,3.9642857142857144
2690550,5,B000KGGZT4,"The play was great. I enjoy reading Eric Jerome Dickey's books; so it is refreshing to see a play created for it. One thing I want to add; please do not be deceived into thinking Arnez J. is in the play. He is not the cast is Miguel Nunez, Monica Calhoun, Leon, and Mel Jackson. I do not know why that is on there, but it is a great feature to see nonetheless.",1244678400,,360,3.9452054794520546
2690551,5,B000KGGZT4,I love this movie! Leon is so fine and the cast was so so funny. 2 thumbs up!,1239926400,,77,3.3333333333333335

2690553,5,B000KGGZT4,Get ready to laugh until your stomach hurts with this one.  It was great to see some humor added.  I would definitely recommended this.,1234656000,,135,4.583333333333333
2690593,5,B000KGGZT4,"I read the book and loved it so I decided to get the play.  Although the play is nothing like the book, I think the play was very interesting.  I suggest that anyone who loves the book should buy the play.",1219622400,,205,3.975609756097561
2690594,1,B000KGGZT4,A true fan of this book will HATE this movie/play as much as I did. It is true to the book by character names and few plot lines ONLY. The play was a MESS! And I am an ERIC JEROME DICKEY FAN! Why the crap would he sign off on this tragedy of a interpretation of his work??? Anyone who even remotely enjoyed the novel will detest this play as much as I did.,1218585600,2,356,3.824324324324324
2690595,5,B000KGGZT4,I'M A SUCKER FOR THESE STAGE PLAYS (WHEN THEY ARE GOOD).  WATCHING LEON ANYTIME IS REAL GOOD.  STORYLINE WAS GOOD AND SO WAS THE ACTING.,1210550400,,136,4.4
2690596,5,B000KGGZT4,"I really enjoyed this play. It was full of great chemistry, and definitely funny. (Chiquita girl was crazy!!) The characters were a pleasure to watch, and it got straight to the point unlike like most blk plays ..lmao! On top of that, there wasn't signing every damn 5 minutes which kept my focus.. hallelujah!! anyways.. whether you are single preparing yourself for marriage, or married already.. This is a must Watch.. Happy Viewing",1204588800,,435,4.972602739726027
2690597,5,B000KGGZT4,It is obvious that the producers took the time to select quality actors.  The cast brought the book to life.  I can watch this play again.,1199923200,,138,4.269230769230769
2690598,5,B000KGGZT4,"Then I think you will really like the play. It's different from the book, but not too different that if you've read the book you can't follow the play. It's interesting to see the characters in one of my favorite books come to life on the stage. Leon was great in his role as Tyrel. Mel Jackson was a handsome and great pick for the role of Richard. Everyone seemed to fit their roles. I was impressed and would love to see other plays by I'm Ready Productions.",1198627200,,461,4.25
2690599,3,B000KGGZT4,"I read the book that this stage play is based on in about 48 hours it was so good, the play wasn't quite as exciting but still good. Leon, as usual plays his role flawlessly. I'd recommend this one if you are into stage plays.",1193184000,,226,4.044444444444444
2690600,5,B000KGGZT4,"Excellent show. When I purchased this item, I thought it was a movie, but it turned out to be a stage play setting, which was also perfectly fine. I just love Leon and Monica. The show is great and I would definitely suggest buying it. So much so, that at the end, it provides the writers/directors website and I actually purchased tickets to their play that was currently in town. This was a wise purchase.... I can always find what I need from Amazon. Keep up the good work....",1190764800,,479,4.393258426966292
2690601,4,B000KGGZT4,"I enjoyed this play. For the first time this play was really professionally done, unlike a lot of other African-American plays.
The characters worked really while together. Sister Cantoloupe and Lavell were hilarious and Leon shocked me with his singing.",1188432000,,254,5.375
2690602,5,B000KGGZT4,I really enjoyed this play.  I have not stop watching it since I purchased it.  The play had all the qualities I look for in a well developed production.  The acting was great as well as the very funny comedy and the superb singing.  The production of the play was of the highest quality and I strongly recommend purchasing this dvd.  I am looking forward to purchasing more African American plays with the same degree of excellence as this one.,1188432000,6,445,4.5125
