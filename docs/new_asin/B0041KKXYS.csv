8412968,2,B0041KKXYS,"I was looking forward to seeing a rundown of individual lighthouses, which there was some of, but this was mostly interviews with various officials offering their ""take"" on the general history of lighthouses. There's a lot of old photos. It would be nice if they would have shown some live footage with inside views and a story of the particular families of the lightkeepers. The film came across as boring.",1354924800,3,407,4.828571428571428
