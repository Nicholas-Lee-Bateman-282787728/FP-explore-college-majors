4099598,4,B0039ZF8MS,"Taggart has been around for over 20 years and is still a high quality show. the story lines are consistently thoughtful, interesting  and delightfully( in these days )thus far free of political correctness. The foursome main cast is superb. All in all a top-shelf adult crime drama.",1288569600,3,282,5.0
4099599,5,B0039ZF8MS,"This on-going, although I do hear that it is finally (sadly) being brought to a filmed halt soon, beloved TV crime show (this series culled from 2005) brings us it's usual 8 episodes -  spread (mysteriously) over four discs!

Even here, it's hard to see the guys from America's CSI mixing well with the guys from Strathclyde Police (albethey a non-fictional police force in their own right!), as Robbie plants his feet right on top of a suspects garden imprint, and a knifed body in an alley is moved left and right to check its pockets - all without gloves on!

Anyway, as always, 'Taggart' is full of suspense, action, thrilling sequences of invetigation, and still ranks as one of the great which British Mystery and Crime series' to (supposedly) still be on our TVs.

In 'MIND OVER MATTER,' first a student, then a nurse are battered to death. Both are in the same therapy group. DS Reid (Blythe Duff) goes undercover within the group, based on her past history, to try to find the killer, who they believe is one of said group. Complete with brand new opening credits, more darker, mysterious ones at that, there is not much to write home about here, tempo wise. Mind you, head man Burke's rant at a prisoner is worth its weight in gold: ""I don't have the patience for all this bollocks""!

In 'CAUSE AND EFFECT,' a young, beautiful wife is brutally murdered at her home, whilst her older husband is on his expansive yacht. Again, not much to write home about, more script wise this time, as it plays out just the way you imagined it would re: the killer, and their associations therein.

In 'A TASTE OF MONEY,' Scotland's a nasty place to criticize a restaurant and when one food critic dies in a weird and poignant manner it's time for more than one chef to hit the fan. In truth, as much as this is a better episode than the other two, it is made all the more sweeter by the lovely Ashley Jenson ('Extras'). My goodness, she is adorable. As for edge of the seat stuff, well, the odd mark left on the victim's neck will keep you guessing for a while.

In 'A DEATH FORETOLD,' a confession to a priest may be the secret to unlock the case of a serial killer. But, given his oath, will the priest reveal confessional conversations? Of course not, but as DS Reid has a personal issue ongoing in her life, she bonds with the priest. This episode finally shakes the shaky cobwebs off and gives us two murders in the first act! This is a very religious episode and a vry personal one for DS Jackie Reid, as she visits her ex-husband in a hospice, himself just days to live.

In 'DO OR DIE,' a soldier supposedly commits suicid and a murder, seemingly once unrelated, suddenly gets tied in back to a military base. A very army-infused episode this one, showing me why I never chose to subject myself to these 'camps' to gain the better man out of me! Anyway, aside from that, once it gets going there's no stopping it. Who the double act of killers are is easily guessed from the second act in, but that doesn't spoil the fun of watching it all unfold.

In 'RUNNING OUT OF TIME,' police are being shot all over the place: in people's houses and even on a Scottish lake whilst fishing! The trouble is, the latter is DCI Burke (Alex Norton) himself! Now, as much as this is a very good, very solid, very edge-of-the-seat episode, I have a major problem or two with it! Firstly, Burke was shot (in the morning) in the neck, blood spurting out like a fountain all over the place. He then slumped down back into his floating-aimlessly boat. DC Reid, against all office reasoning, drives into nowhere to just go talk to him, miraciously finds his wayward boat, and gets him to hospital - and, even though this is later in the afternoon, he is STILL ALIVE!!!!

My ass would he still be alive! He would be dead as a dodo by that point of the day the amount of blood that gushed from his sniper-hit neck! But, all through the episode the gang work out whodunit without their #1, all the time the hospital teasing us with 'He's not looking good' and 'You might want to get your people here soon' statements! Does he survive? Not telling you ... but, perhaps if he's in the rest of the season, maybe that answers your question for you?!

In 'CAUSE TO KILL,' not much is said about Burke's near-fatal shooting the episode before, but he is to the fore when his memory is jogged of an old killing - whilst looking into a new murder. Is it a serial, copycat, or was the convicted original killer the wrong person? This time, a so-called ""Profiler"" (Dr. Russell, played by Alison Peebles) and crime book author joins the investigation. That said, she couldn't profile her way out of a wet paper bag if her life depended on it! haven't they seen the work the profiler does on 'Waking The Dead'?!

Anyway, a cafe subplot quickly turns into the mainstay of this episode and bit by bit the tension mounts. As for who the killer turns out to be, well, there weren't many usual suspects to choose from so it turns out to be somebody outside the box, so to speak. Nicely done too.

Finally, in 'DEAD MAN WALKING,' a business partner goes missing after an auto mechanic is torched to death. Well, we get a horrific murder in the opening 60 seconds here so you know the last episode in the series will be going out with a bang. The two gangster-type crooks here, brothers, are about as scary as a plate of jelly at a kids party table, to be quite frank, but everyone seems soooooo frickin' afraid of them! That aside, one of the characters, a snitch called Arthur (Brian Pettifer) sets out to help the police and gets (in a very disturbing scene - mentally) his fingers cut off his left hand for his troubles!",1286409600,7,5683,4.437200383509109
4099600,5,B0039ZF8MS,"On TV since 1983, this Scotland crime investigation series finds some of the disgusting and heinous crimes challenging, and eventual discoveries of the unexpected. That's why it survived so long. This 8-episode set draws from 2005 airings. Disturbing crime investigated with state-of-the-art techniques, and intuition. Suspense, action, thrilling sequence, which meets the competition of so many great British Mystery and Crime series. It stands among the top of the greats.

Subtitles are available, and assist some with Scot dialect. You'll see some beautiful scenery, but also expect some caution-able scenes. It's unrated, but keep it among the adults.

8392653,5,B0039ZF8MS,"If you enjoy a good nitty gritty detective story, then Taggart is for you.  It is a TV series that started up in the UK some years back and is set in Scotland.  The individual stories are often raw and the detectives have no frills.  However, if you are not originally from the UK as I am,you might need subtitles!",1378425600,,314,4.2
8392654,4,B0039ZF8MS,"I don't know why later collections of this series aren't better known in this country, as more follow this ""Taggart Set 3,"" but little has been done to assert the presence of this Glasgow detective drama. By this collection, Set 3, ""Taggart"" has moved beyond a simple police-procedural, with deepening characterizations and plenty of local color; Set 1 is sporadic in quality, Set 2 greatly improves, Set 3 hits its stride. Blythe Duff is a remarkable actress who merits further renown; she is calm perfection as DS Jackie Reid. Alex Norton is superb as the bulldog-gruff chief, DCI Matt Burke. John Michie as DI Robbie Ross, and Colin MeCredie as Stuart Fraser, grow in their roles as well. Glasgow, of course, is another ripe character here, proud of its contract to the more ""refined"" Edinburgh. The teamwork of this excellent cast makes for a great alternative to the common formula of older mentor/DCI, plus young upstart. In this collection, each of the four must confront fraught unresolved issues; this is deftly woven in the mysteries progress.

On this side of the pond, we are completely deprived of the rest of this great series! Yes, there is more after Set 3 (Amazon UK + Region-free DVD player)! Oddly, 6 episodes between the end of what is available here in the U.S., and what is still being sold in the U.K. remain unavailable. At least what follows continues the story with very little break. Unfortunately, all that follow have no subtitles, but it's easy enough to understand, and the sound-quality is excellent. The series that follow ""Taggart Set 3"" are listed in order:

The 2009 Collection: Genesis, The Caring Game, Lifeline.

Special 25th Anniversary Edition: Judgement Day, Island (beautiful scenery), Trust, A Study in Murder, Point of Light. This collection features an enlightening Special Feature, ""Taggart: 25 Years of Murder Documentary."" You'll glimpse the old series with Mark McManus, and a piece on the the hilarious French voice-over, where a Marseille accent is used to mimic ""Glaswegian.""

The Knife Trick Collection: Safer, Homesick, Crossing the Line, Cold Reader, Grass, The Knife Trick. ""Homesick"" features another memorable appearance of Brian McCardie (featured in an earlier episode) as a menacing Bad Guy again. We need to see more of him; he's also the only stand-out in Season 5 of ""Murphy's Law."" A wonderful Special is the ""Outtakes,"" where you'll laugh yourself silly.

The 100th Episode Collection: So Long Baby, Fact and Fiction, I.O.U., Local Hero, The Rapture. In ""So Long Baby,"" the actress Michelle Fairley is a perfect doppelganger for the actress Joan Allen, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Trilogy/dp/B003H6KRIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Trilogy</a>.

New Blood, Six New Cases: Bad Medicine, Abuse & Trust, Silent Truth, Fallen Angels, Bloodsport, The Ends of Justice. The series, for all STV filming in HD, squandered a superb, long-running show. The stories now mimic American police dramas, without the in-depth character development in previous episodes. After 14 years, Colin MeCredie's Stuart Fraser suddenly departs due to a nasty firing after ITV and STV fought over the budget. This collection is the end of the line for the series, and it shows, with a dispirited cast, poor scripts, and an awkward filming style that is reminiscent of old ""NYPD Blue."" A shame.",1366761600,4,3402,5.3024118738404455
8392655,4,B0039ZF8MS,"The Maryhill CID investigates gruesome murders against the bleak backdrop of the city of Glasgow. The weather in Glasgow is most often bleak, rainy, and cool. However, the sun does come out, and it is found in the team of police in Maryhill.  This series, 'Taggart' has been on the air since 1986. I have seen three series, and everyone of them is a winner.

Taggart is a Scottish detective television programme, created by Glenn Chandler, who has written many of the episodes, and made by STV Productions for the ITV network. The series revolves around a group of detectives initially in the Maryhill CID of Strathclyde Police, though various storylines have happened in other parts of the Greater Glasgow area, and as of the most recent series the team have operated out of the fictional John Street police station across the street from the City Chambers. The head honcho is DCI Matt Burke, played by Alex Norton. He is the true portrayal of the head of a police department. Blythe Duff, playsvDI Jackie Reid, the most popular of the police. She has intelligence,professionlism and a heart. John Michie, plays DI Ronnie Ross. The handsome guy, always with an eye for the ladies. Colin Mc Credie plays DC Stuart Fraser, he came out as Gay and this made for some interesting storylines.

In Series 3, the first four episodes were new and so well done. Each story varied and well written. The last four episodes were re-runs of previous episodes. That was a big disappointment to me. I paid for eight new episodes and really only received four.

Recommended. prisrob 02-20-13",1361318400,2,1575,4.800738007380073
