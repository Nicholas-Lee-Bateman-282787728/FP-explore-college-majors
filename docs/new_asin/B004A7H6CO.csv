8419574,5,B004A7H6CO,"This is a fabulous workout for people who have difficulty or hate to exercise.  If you wake up stiff in the mornings and can't imagine doing a workout like your healer recommends, try this first.  You may start out stiff but after 30 minutes you are supple and ready to do more.",1397606400,,278,4.326923076923077

8419576,2,B004A7H6CO,"Practicing tai-chi-inspired movements is a wonderful way to restore & renew both body and mind. Unfortunately, within 10 minutes of listening to Karen Holden I started to think I might go OUT of my mind. The woman never stops talking. Never. Because of her continuous, raspy voice, I couldn't hear the relaxing background music, or even stay focused on my movements & breathing. Holden takes the tranquility out of a discipline that requires serenity & self-focus. There are some good sequences in this video, but Holden compromises many of them with too much repetition. I may give the video another try - with the volume turned off & my own background music. Then again, I may just toss it & go back to my tried & true Scott Cole DVDs.",1341964800,,737,4.676923076923077
