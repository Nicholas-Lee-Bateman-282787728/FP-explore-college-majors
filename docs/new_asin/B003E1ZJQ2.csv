4112951,5,B003E1ZJQ2,Very informative.  We loved watching it as a family.  We learned a lot about the families of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.,1395100800,,124,4.590909090909091
4112952,3,B003E1ZJQ2,It was interesting even if they had an agenda that showed over time. It would be nice to see theotehr sides POV,1363737600,,111,4.090909090909091
4112953,1,B003E1ZJQ2,"very disappointing, though it would be the history of Joseph Smith and his family. Instead it really did not tell much about them.",1361145600,6,130,4.695652173913044
4112954,3,B003E1ZJQ2,"Generally, the history of the Smith family in Nauvoo after Joseph's death was good, but I felt they were whitewashing the power vacuum which existed in Nauvoo during that roughly two year period until Brigham lead the Saints west. Additionally, they explicitly indicated there wasn't any antipathy between Emma and Brigham Young, while other sources indicate there was. Considering the several attempts made to gain her willingness to come to Salt Lake and her consistent rejection of those offers, I am inclined to believe there was a gulf there which could not be bridged.",1360454400,6,574,5.117021276595745
4112955,5,B003E1ZJQ2,Full of honest insight and story that will make you think deeper about an interesting man and prophet in the Americas,1349049600,2,117,4.619047619047619

4112958,1,B003E1ZJQ2,"The world is full of folks trying to create a church they feel comfortable in.  That's not the way it works.  There is nothing wrong with the faith that Jesus Christ left us with.  When He comes back, there's gonna be some vacuous explainin'.",1427932800,,242,4.454545454545454
4112959,2,B003E1ZJQ2,"I thought this would be a documentary about his children. Nope. If anything, it's a documentary of Emma Smith. It's a fundraising-information video by a Joseph and Emma Smith historical foundation. It's about what the foundation does and has done. The children of his other wives are totally ignored except for two off-the-cuff-not-relevant mentions.",1417478400,4,350,5.5
4112960,5,B003E1ZJQ2,Very informative and moving!,1411257600,,28,6.25

4112962,1,B003E1ZJQ2,"This was absolutely terrible.  So very disappointing.  The film has nothing to do with tracking the history of Joseph Smith's immediate children but rather is a propaganda piece on how Smith's descendants today are ""fulfilling prophecy.""  It's boring, irrelevant, purely based on speculation and a flat out waste of time.",1409702400,4,321,5.38
4112963,3,B003E1ZJQ2,I didn't feel that I learned anything with this tape.  Learning the plight of the wife and the hardship of continuing the church were the themes of the piece.  I wanted more information about the reasons for the departure of Joseph and the outcome of the trip.  Was the trip successful?,1409270400,,286,4.568627450980392
4112964,5,B003E1ZJQ2,"Liked it very much, nice to see Josephs posterity being able to learn about him. Love him or hate him he is definitely a man of history that made a huge impact on religion in America.",1407369600,,183,4.111111111111111
4112965,5,B003E1ZJQ2,"Magnificant documentary!  I am so glad this was made.  I learned a lot about the children of Joseph Smith and their descendants.

I am glad this work was added to my library, I highly recomend it.",1400457600,,196,4.388888888888889

8395215,5,B003E1ZJQ2,"A very informative film on what the Joseph and Emma Smith historical foundation is doing.
So far as previous comments on being a fun raiser, I didn't seen any request for money and
was certainly not asked for any contribution or money.
This film is what it is and it does that very well.",1477440000,,287,4.333333333333333
8395216,1,B003E1ZJQ2,Lack of information and historical facts. It's just a testimony meeting filmed on video.,1454371200,2,88,5.357142857142857
8395217,2,B003E1ZJQ2,I was disappointed that there was not more history included.,1453593600,2,60,5.1

8395222,1,B003E1ZJQ2,"I feel like after watching this video, the story of the Children of Joseph is still unknown.  I also found the video to be very biased, as if the LDS church paid for the whole production.  This is an important thing to note because (after watching another video) I found out that the children of Joseph Smith Jr. played an integral part in getting the RLDS Church up and running.  In fact, the RLDS Church has had a Smith as Prophet and President at the head of the church consistently until 1996.  For someone who wants to know about the Smith family, this information is completely ignored.  To find out about the offspring of Joseph Smith Jr. you're better off taking a look at these videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFza0c3CRDA & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvUcAQXoiU",1435622400,3,784,5.046511627906977
