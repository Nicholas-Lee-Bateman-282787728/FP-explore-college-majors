8356275,2,B0028J867K,"Routine is too difficult.  I have done step aerobics for a long time and I am pretty coordinated but I just cant get the routine down.  I think there should be a demonstration part to the video in slow motion.  Also, I can barely hear the music so I didn't really get into the routine.  I think if you are real advanced and can learn the routine it would be a good workout.",1393804800,,373,4.068493150684931
8356276,5,B0028J867K,"This dvd is a great one. In order to be kind to my knees I vary between the low impact option and the higher impact option, either one you choose you will get a great workout. Welcome to my workout rotation Tonya!",1342051200,,213,4.095238095238095
8356277,5,B0028J867K,"I really enjoy the step portions of this DVD. The cueing is good, the music is fun, and the instructor isn't annoying. I find the strength training portion of the DVD lacking in difficulty. I am never sore the day after the strength training, even when I up my weights. If you're only interested in maintaining muscle mass and not really gaining muscle mass, the non-challenging weight training will probably be sufficient for you. I perfer Jackie Warner and Jeri Love for strength training  The step series is for the advanced stepper. However, there is one back-up dancer showing the basic moves throughout. The basic moves are always demonstrated first, and then Tonya and 1 back-up dancer demonstrate (and continue to do) the advanced moves while one dancer stays with the more basic movements.",1300233600,4,798,4.955223880597015
8356278,3,B0028J867K,This was an okay workout.  Not the most challenging....but it was fine for my lighter days.,1261353600,,91,4.6875
8356279,5,B0028J867K,"This is one of my all time favorite workouts. In fact, it is also my favorite in the CIA 2900 series and I do love Amy Bento and Seasun Zieger. But this one has everything: cardio/step + weight intervals (and I mean real weights - not the 3 lbs dumbbells used in so many DVDs), abs, stretch, ""pick-me-up"" hit music, no dread factor, challenge, some high-impact, sweat and the perfect just over an hour length (about 67 min). You get a true, complete workout and the music just wants to make you move. Plus it has several premixed options, like cardio onlyl or all weights together, and some shorter variations. So worth the money! The more I do it the more I love it. Just awesome.",1251158400,9,681,4.412698412698413
8356280,5,B0028J867K,"This is Tonya's first CIA DVD and she did a GREAT job! She cues very well and the workout was a lot of fun. There are 6 combos which consist of step and then weights then it goes to cooldown, abs and then stretch for a total of 67 mins. She also shows modifications on the combos and has a modifier in the back that you can follow at all times. The music is really good! I look forward to buying more of her workout DVDs.",1243036800,7,421,3.9069767441860463
