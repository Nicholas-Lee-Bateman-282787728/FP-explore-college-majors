3487119,4,B001B9ZVVC,"[This review is part of my 31 days of Halloween Series]

I will only comment on THE GORGON, as it is a really great Hammer Production film, created at the height of the company's prestige. The attention to detail & production values are of the highest caliber & the cast headed by Peter Cushing is excellent. The plot at first sight seems ridiculous: One of the original 3 Gorgon's fled her homeland in Greece & eventually settled in Great Britain. All three hideous sisters could turn to stone anyone who dared to look upon their frightening faces & writhing serpent hair. The details of how all this came about don't matter either. The movie opens in an appropriately abandoned mansion--well, it looks abandoned, but we all know who lives there. This atmosphere of suspense is maintained throughout the picture by the subplot: The creature appears as a beautiful woman most of the time, and only exhibits her less savory aspects on the night of the full moon (what else?) Another plot twist: Even the creature herself doesn't realize who she is when in human form. Of course it doesn't take too long to figure which character it is, but what the hell? Throughout the movie you get little tantalizing glimpses of the creature, but the complete Gorgon is only revealed at the end, and it's well worth the wait.

I loved it and I'm sure other kids will love it too.

NOTE: The movie deviates from mythology in that while it's true that Medusa was not immortal & could be killed, her two sisters were immortal. In fact, they are probably alive today, possibly living somewhere on the south coast of France.

3487120,3,B001B9ZVVC,"""Icons of Horror 3""  is a two-disc set containing the uncut UK versions of four Hammer Films features made between 1960 and 1964.  These are lesser Hammer films and aren't in the same league as the studio's Frankenstein and Dracula movies.  ""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" follows an expedition to Egypt as its members open a cursed crypt.  The leader of the crew decides to give the ruins to a museum, but a fast-talking American grabs the tomb for a sideshow attraction.  In ""Scream of Fear,"" wheelchair-bound Penny (Susan Strasberg) pays a visit to her father's Riviera resort and finds her father's corpse propped up in the back yard.  Everyone thinks she's crazy, but she believes she's the victim of a plot to drive her mad.
 ""The Gorgon,"" starring Hammer regulars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, takes place in a Balkan village where a professor is investigating the suicide of his youngest son.  No one is willing to help the professor, so he enters the ruins of a local castle, where he encounters the legendary monster whose gaze turns men to stone.  Before dying, the professor warns his eldest son, who continues the investigation.
 ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" is yet another variation on the Robert Louis Stevenson tale.  Absorbed in research to isolate the good and evil natures of man, Dr. Jekyll (Paul Massie) degenerates into the vengeful maniac, Mr. Hyde.  While Hyde seeks revenge against a gambler whom his wife loves, Dr. Jekyll, revolted by his second nature, takes steps to do away with his evil self.  Look for a young Oliver Reed in the small role of a nightclub bouncer.",1223856000,4,1601,4.778181818181818
3487121,4,B001B9ZVVC,"I own over 30 Hammer flicks on DVD, & there are only a few I do not own that I want to( the Cushing-less 'Horror of Frankenstein' is one available that I don't want, 'Kiss of the Vampire' I have 'cuz it came in a box set with other excellent Hammers I DID want ), and this release plugs a very BIG hole in my horror library, sub-group Hammer Films!  'The Gorgon', IMO, is up there with the Cushing Frankensteins & Lee Draculas.

'Curse of the Mummy's Tomb' is not the best of Hammer, but it's hardly the worst - nice to see it in this set.  'Scream of Fear' & 'Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll' I cannot comment on as I have not seen them.  But I will..........soon!",1223078400,3,657,4.069767441860465

3487123,4,B001B9ZVVC,"While Columbia was the most faithful purchaser of Hammer productions--crime films, war films, swashbucklers, even comedies--they didn't get the best of their gothic output, which at this time usually went to Universal-International. The films in this set vary in quality. SCREAM OF FEAR was the first of a long line of psychological thrillers from Hammer. It had a strong cast, led by Christopher Lee and a fine director (Seth Holt) at the helm. It's no PSYCHO, but it does it's job. THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL was the first really problematic Hammer production. Some people loved the idea of a handsome Mr. Hyde, others hated it. Since this is Columbia's package, we will hopefully be seeing the version of the film that Columbia released, not the edited melange that appeared in the U.S. under the utterly silly title HOUSE OF FRIGHT. (And while we're at it, let's hope that all of these films are presented in the letterbox format.) THE GORGON is undoubtedly the best film in the set. It offers Terence Fisher directing at the top of his form and a nifty bad guy turn by Peter Cushing as an asylum director with something to hide. Christopher Lee gets to play the hero of sorts as a grumpy classics professor who knows a little something about Gorgons and how to deal with them. The runt of this litter is definitely THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB. It's very similar to the Universal Mummy films of the 1940s, but it does demonstrate the virtues of Hammer's superior production design and the effectiveness of the roster of fine British character actors they could call upon to flesh out even the most uninspired script.",1217894400,11,1623,4.738515901060071
3487124,4,B001B9ZVVC,"With so many acknowledged classics from Hammer Studios already available on DVD, I was beginning to wonder if lesser-known efforts like these would ever be released.  In case you may have missed them, here's a bit about the films themselves:

TWO FACES OF DR. JECKYLL is the real gem of the set.  Christopher Lee is perfectly cast as the hedonistic friend to Paul Massie's Dr. Jeckyll.  Hammer favorite Terence Fisher directs this very adult (for its time) story.

CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB is neither the worst (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-s-Shroud/dp/6305808198/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy's Shroud</a>) nor best (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-From-the-Mummy-s-Tomb/dp/B00005KHJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood From the Mummy's Tomb</a>) of Hammer's follow-ups to the 1959 original Mummy.  In the worst tradition of Mummy movies, however, it's a pretty dull offering.

THE GORGON is a fine pairing of icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and is among Hammer's most expensive-looking productions.  The title creature reminds one of the work done by the great Ray Harryhausen.

SCREAM OF FEAR is another seldom-seen thriller, much in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (Collector's Edition)</a>.  It's certainly the most realistic of the films in this collection.

While no single film here (with the possible exception of TWO FACES...) really compares to Hammer's best films, there's still plenty of b-grade thrills for fans of films of this type.",1216684800,37,1688,6.732718894009216

The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb was terrific and I'm sure pretty violent for the time. The two Faces of Dr. Jekyll was probably my least favorite just because the actor portraying Dr. Jekyll was not very good. The Gorgon was pretty good too, if not predictable.

3487149,4,B001B9ZVVC,"The 4 films collected on this double disc set were made by Hammer Films between 1960 and 1964. In fact, 2 are from 1960 and 2 are from 1964 yet they are not coupled together on their respective DVDs which would have made sense not only chronologically but thematically as well. The 2 1960 features, SCREAM OF FEAR and TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL, are psychological studies while the 1964 ones, CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB and THE GORGON are straightforward monster movies. However since both discs have one of each, I'll focus on JEKYLL & TOMB for this review and save SCREAM and GORGON for another day.

First up, since it's the lesser of the 2, is THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB. This came 5 years after THE MUMMY and follows the same basic scenario. Archeologists mess with the tomb, the mummy comes to life, and kills those responsible except for the hero played here by Ronald Howard (son of Leslie). There's even a flashback sequence setting up the present day action that occurs later in the film. There is one clever plot twist, which I won't divulge, that caught me by surprise and helped make the movie for me. Another plus in my book is American actor Fred Clark playing a P. T. Barnum like huckster. Not only does he have some great lines, but his (and Hammer's) staging of the opening of the sarcophagus is an absolute joy.

However the highlight of this disc is the other film, THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL which I had never seen until this set was released. For the time, this is an extremely adult treatment of the story featuring not only violence but open infidelity, friendship betrayal, some overt can-can footage, and the most salacious dance between a girl and a snake that you will ever see. The twist here is that Mr Hyde is extremely attractive and smooth talking, seducing everyone he meets. Canadian actor Paul Massie does a good job in the roles originally intended for Laurence Harvey and Dawn Addams is a fetching Mrs. Jekyll. Christopher Lee has one of his best early roles as the faithless friend and look fast for Oliver Reed in his first Hammer role. Terence Fisher's direction is more intense than usual. Another winner in Sony's ICON series.",1381622400,,2169,4.587628865979381

view.

It's kind of hard for me to explain what the film is about except that it concernes a snake-like woman creature who turns people to stone with one stare. To me it was well worth the purchase.

The 2 Faces of Dr. Jekyll is not themost successful adaption but still a worthy effort and a solid story.
The Gorgon is the main reason I bought the set. You have in it both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and they are sensational in it.

3487161,4,B001B9ZVVC,"Sony rolls out four Hammer films as part of its ""Icons"" series including the long sought after uncut version of ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" and ""The Gorgon"".

All four films look marvelous with ""Jekyll"" and ""Gorgon"" surprisingly good looking transfers. ""Gorgon"" has a rich, colorful presentation. ""Tomb"" also looks good as well. ""Scream"" is the only B&W film of the bunch and the transfer looks quite nice over all. Sony has done a nice job of transferring these for DVD and I hope that we might get a high def transfer on Blu-ray someday for the better films included here. Each film is presented in its original aspect ratio (as near as I can recall with ""Scream"" and ""Gorgon"" both in 1.66:1 aspect ratio while ""Tomb"" and ""Jekyll"" are in 2.35:1). The original mono sounds pretty solid throughout.

English subtitles are included which is a good thing for most folks who grew up on these films as many of them are aging boomers.

We don't get any extras except for the original theatrical trailer (which in the case of some of these films is a hoot because of how previews have changed over the years).

""Jekyll"" scripted by Wolf Mankowitz does a nice job of twisting the story by making Hyde the smooth, charming ladies man who is really a monster underneath it all. Terence Fisher's directs a slick horror flick that may drag a bit in the middle (and that may be one of the reasons that American-International cut it for its domestic release ages ago)but over all remains remarkably involving. Strong performances are a highlight with Oliver Reed and Christopher Lee in supporting roles and the lead Paul Massie doing a convincing job of playing both roles (although one has to wonder HOW Jekyll's substanial facial hair miraculously vanishes when he turns into Hyde and then has it instantly grow back).

One of the two best features here is the B&W ""Scream of Fear"" which wears its Hitchcock influences on its sleeve. A psychological thriller scripted by Jimmy Sangster (""Horror of Dracula"", ""Curse of Frankenstein"" among others)and directed by Seth Holt, the film stars Susan Strassberg as a wheelchair bound woman who returns home from school after her father's untimely death. She believes she may be having a nervous break down when she begins seeing her father's dead body around the estate. We once again have nice support work from Christopher Lee in this film.

""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" proves that producer Michael Carreras directed here was a ill suited to that role as he often was as a writer. ""Tomb"" is pure filler with not much to recommend it beyond some nice photography.

""The Gorgon"" is an atmospheric thriller with much of the emphasis placed on the former with nice direction by Terence Fisher. Paul Heitz (Richard Pasco)tries to solve the mystery of his brother and father's deaths. It appears that some sort of female creature is preying in the men turning them to stone. All this has been covered up by the local doctor (Peter Cushing) and Heitz calls on his professor (Christopher Lee)to help solve the mystery. What's interesting here is to see Cushing cast in a less sympathetic role and Lee more as the Van Helsing-like character. The major flaw of the film is a disappointing creature (reportedly redesigned and simplified due to budget constraints and a complicated make up design). The film would have benefited from a truly horrorifying creature but what we get looks kind of silly undercutting much of the suspense that Fisher's carefully paced direction creates.

Fans of Hammer horror films will enjoy this set although it might have been nice to have a commentary from Christopher Lee for the films he appears and/or a featurette on the films, what we do get is a solid looking set of enjoyable films. Recommended.",1302912000,2,3763,4.814241486068111

3487163,4,B001B9ZVVC,"Hammer Horror turned out a lot of now-classic movies, particularly their adaptations of the Dracula and Frankenstein stories (and their varying sequels). But ""Icons of Horror Collection: Hammer Films"" focuses instead of some of their less well-known movies -- tales of gorgons, mummies, murders and the legendary Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.

""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" kicks in when a mummy is uncovered in Egypt by Sir Giles Dalrymple, Annette Dubois, and John Bray. But after it is co-opted by the greedy showbizzer Alexander King, it vanishes without a trace. Then King and Giles are found strangled -- and the mummy seems intent on killing anyone who violated its tomb.

And in ""Scream of Fear,"" wheelchair-bound Penny Appleby (Susan Strasberg) travels to her father's Riviera estate -- and that night, she is shocked to see his dead body propped up in a storehouse. His body keeps appearing, but it always vanishes before she can show it to someone. Is Penny losing her mind, or has her genial stepmother Jane (Ann Todd) murdered him?

The weakest entry has to be ""The Two Faces Of Dr. Jekyll,"" in which Dr. Henry Jekyll is trying to find a way to access humanity's ""dark"" and ""light"" side... and fails to notice that his wife is having an affair with his buddy Paul (Christopher Lee). Jekyll ends up accessing his own dark side -- called ""Edward Hyde"" -- and soon discovers that Hyde is quickly overwhelming him.

Finally, ""The Gorgon"" is loose in a small German town in the early 1900s, but for some reason no one will acknowledge that people are being turned to stone. After his brother and father are killed, the incredibly annoying Paul Heitz (Richard Pasco) is determined to find the creature that did it, with the help of his mentor (Christopher Lee).

""Icons of Horror Collection: Hammer Films"" is a pretty solid sampling of Hammer's lesser-known movies. ""Scream of Terror"" is a truly brilliant film, a Hitchcockian thriller with a tiny cast, exquisite direction, and a great double-twist ending that can't be predicted. ""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" and ""The Gorgon"" are the solid monster-flicks that Hammer excelled at.

The one weak link here is the Dr. Jekyll movie. It's not bad, but it's just so UNSCARY. Hyde comes across as a smug jerk, and it takes most of the movie for him to do anything really evil.

And what would a Hammer Horror boxed set be without Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee? Cushing is only in one movie, where he plays a man tormented by his knowledge of a monster. But Lee gets to show his full range in three different roles -- as a vaguely sinister French doctor, a pleasure-loving playboy, and a quirky German professor (which is a more typically Cushingian role).

""Icons of Horror Collection: Hammer Films"" is a solid foursome of movies -- a brilliant suspense film, a so-so adaptation of a classic book, and two entertaining monster movies. A fun way to spend the evening.",1297382400,,2918,4.798804780876494

3487168,4,B001B9ZVVC,"Scream of Fear is an absolute classic movie. When I discovered it was available (with 3 other movies) on the Hammer Films DVD I had to purchase it. I wasn't interested in the other films to be honest, but it was so reasonably priced that it was worth purchasing.

For people that have seen Scream of Fear, you will never forget it. It's a real mystery film that will keep you intrigued until the very end. It's maybe not as scary as it would have been back when it was made but it is still creepy, so it's not overly dated.

I enjoyed the movie as much as I did when I first saw it. The DVD transfer is of high quality. My old VHS copy of this movie was starting to deteriorate so I am pleased that I now have a DVD copy.

If you have ever seen Scream of Fear I would recommend purchasing this DVD. Even if you haven't seen it before, you are in for a real treat. I'm sure in the future I will watch the other movies contained on this 2 disc set, but for now I am more than satisfied at owning this DVD just for Scream of Fear alone. If this film were more mainstream I'm sure they would have remade it by now. Maybe it's better that it hasn't been remade though because the original is just perfect.",1254268800,2,1200,4.0548523206751055
3487169,5,B001B9ZVVC,"I got this set because I love ""The Gorgon"", truly a classic horror movie. Since it's my favorite in this set, I shall review ""The Gorgon"" first. The movie is filled with tension and suspense, and is highly atmospheric (an element I love in these classic horror movies). The movie is also quite unique as it has Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee playing reversed roles than what one would expect them to portray, i.e. Lee is the good guy and Cushing is the misguided baddie. The story in brief - a small town in Germany circa early 20th century is plagued by gruesome and mysterious deaths which the local authorities hush up. The bodies have all been turned to stone, and Peter Cushing who plays Dr Namaroff, the director of the local asylum, is complicit in this hush-up as well. Amidst this setting, a young man named Paul Heitz arrives to investigate his brother and father's mysterious deaths. He learns from a letter left by his father that there may be an evil force lurking in the small town, a Gorgon whose stare is fatal to all who see it, turning them into stone.

As Paul investigates, he meets an attractive lady who also happens to be Namaroff's assistant, Carla (Barbara Shelley). When things get more dangerous, he pleads with his old professor to come and assist him (Christopher Lee). There is much suspense in this movie, and I thought the production qualities were above average. The acting is excellent, especially by Cushing, Lee and, Shelley, and the quality of the DVD is clear.

Now for the other three films:
""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" - revolves around the resurrection of the mummy Ra, who goes on to carry out despicable acts under the control of an evil person who possesses a powerful amulet. This is a weak horror movie, ridden with cliches, and truly underwhelming. The actors are ho-hum, with an especially atrocious dubbing job on the actress who err, gets unwelcome attention from the mummy. There is an interesting twist in the movie though which kept it mildly interesting. Not one I'd care to see again.

""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" - directed by Terence Fisher,this 1960 Hammer production stars Paul Massie as Dr. Jekyll, and also co-stars Christopher Lee, David Kossoff, and Dawn Addams. What was interesting about this movie is the way the two personas are conceived - Dr. Jekyll is portrayed as a tepid character whereas Dr. Hyde is portrayed as charismatic and good-looking.

""Scream of Fear"" - Susan Strasberg plays a crippled young woman at the mercy of an evil person/s bent on driving her insane. This movie is more of a psychological thriller, and is quite a well-done suspense movie.

3487171,5,B001B9ZVVC,"I have always been a fan of Hammer horror films, and I regret the studio's passing. As long as we have excellent DVDs such as this package, however, it is not forgotten.

This combo package is one of the best that I have seen. The others reviewers on this page discuss it quite well, so what I have to do add is perhaps from the position of an academic who loves writing about literature and films.

The best of this group is arguably SCREAM OF FEAR, a black-and-white thriller that has been compared to PSYCHO and other Hitchcock works. Perhaps such a comparison is justified, but this little film exists as an eerie mystery in its own right. It is one of the best of the mystery genre -- a work that may have supernatural overtones, but all of these are rationally explained at the end. It is fun for viewers to discover that characters turn out to be not who they are initially set up to be. Ronald Lewis, whom I first saw as Aeneas in Robert Wise' HELEN OF TROY in the mid 1950s, is a centerpiece here -- an apparently sympathetic character who claims to be helping the heroine, the lovely Susan Strasberg. Who can be more helpless than a heroine confined to a wheelchair?

A good mystery keeps its viewers guessing. Does the wheelchair-bound heroine really see the corpse of her dead father throughout the Rivera villa? Is he a ghost? Is Christopher Lee someone on hand to help her or menace her? Does the heroine have some secrets of her own? Perhaps the mystery is clear-cut until the end -- is her father dead or alive? Did someone murder him? If so, who?  However, the ending is meant to throw us for a loop, and it succeeds quite well in this endeavor.

Christopher Lee, who plays a Dr. Gerrard -- using the French spelling of a name that I carry, although mine is the Scottish version of the name -- is a stalwart presence who could easily be the bad-guy of the piece. He is Dracula without fangs, the pirate chief without his sword, and he takes center stage during the few moments when he is on-screen. Casting him as the swarthy-looking physician who appears to know more than he is saying was a deft touch.  At the end, we see him in a new light -- as we do all of the major characters. Quite gripping and compelling little mystery.

Another black-and-white British thriller, which also starred Ronald Lewis, is worthy of being released on DVD. I am unable to recall its name, but it was released in theatres about the time that SCREAM OF FEAR appeared. It also stars Diane Cilento and Claude Dauphin and has a few twists and turns of its own.

THE GORGON is of interest to me because of its mythological origin. Megaera was a sister of the better-known Medusa -- the Greek monster with snakes for hair and a stare that can keep you stoned for good. She was supposedly dispatched by Perseus, son of Zeus, but her sister, as the narrative of THE GORGON sets it up, supposedly fled to the area near this European village. This is a bit hard to swallow, but if one accepts this premise, one is in for a good time. Unfortunately, someone with Ray Harryhausen's skill did not create the Megaera monster herself, and the make-up job is pretty atrocious. One of the minor characters is the actor who played a more significant role in THE WILD GEESE, another Brit actor who, like Michael Ripper, shows up now and then.

Peter Cushing, although top-billed here, is an unsympathetic character who only gets in the way of the hero, played by the very capable Richard Pasco. Cushing is shielding the Barbara Shelley character, and an interesting touch here is that the Megaera monster is played as the evil half of a Jekyll and Hyde character or as a type of werewolf who does a transformation act. How this came about is never explained either. However, in the heat of the battle, who really cares? Cushing's old nemesis, Christopher Lee shows up as a crusty professor who tries to save his former student. Nice switch for Cushing and Lee.  Many of the characters get stoned in the film, and it is to the film's credit that they are not always the characters you expect to meet such a stiffening demise. That said, why the bohemian artist is found hanging instead of being turned to stone like his pregnant girl friend is not clear. If he did not kill himself, who did it and why? If I missed something, which is entirely possible, I apologize.

The music, it should be mentioned, is top notch, adding the perfect pitch to the supernatural proceedings. It is the type of eerie film score that you cannot imagine belonging to any other horror film.

Also not just like any other horror film is THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL, originally released in the US, for some idiotic reason, as HOUSE OF FRIGHT. Although this film includes some top-notch performances, it is far from frightening. Paul Massie speaks his role as Jekyll as if he has a head cold and decided to spout from the bottom of a mug of root beer. God, what horrible make-up! He is definitely no John Malkovich when it comes to playing Jekyll, but his role as Hyde is closer to Malkovich's version of Hyde than any other Hyde character we've seen on the screen. Like Malkovich's Hyde, he is handsome and amoral, vicious and self-serving. The ending of THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL is not the violent shoot-out we often get in a Jekyll and Hyde film. Oliver Reed makes a brief appearance as a sleezy friend of an even sleezier prostitute who meets his end because of his untimely leap across the table at Hyde, who subsequently bashes in his head for his troubles. Christopher Lee again steals the show as an against-type playboy who mooches off of the guileless Jekyll while romancing his estranged wife, played here by Dawn Addams. He oils his way through the proceedings and meets his end too quickly for the good of the film. Incidentally, Addams being raped by Hyde, who is actually her own husband in another guise, provides an interesting, ironic touch, but it is not enough to save this  tepid production.

Another tepid film is the weakest of this collection, probably the weakest in the Mummy collection. The best is, of course, the version with Christopher Lee portraying the mummy in stiff, bandaged wrapped fashion and Peter Cushing starring as the sympathetic hero stumbling around with a limp because his father, the distinguished Felix Alymer, was too busy desecrating the mummy's tomb to have his broken leg set properly. THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB, unlike the superior BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB (based loosely on Bram Stoker's JEWEL OF THE SEVEN STARS), would almost be forgettable were it not for the appearance of American Fred Clark as a Barnum and Bailly showman type. Clark is obstreperous and superb, as he usually is, off-setting the British performances who are more staid and colorless.  That he lacks integrity because of his ballyhoo-conscious intentions is not surprising, since this is the way many British and Europeans see the typical American -- an image that is not always unjustified. Terence Morgan in the lead as the man who is a lot older than we think steals the heroine from the hapless and straight-laced Ronald Howard character. His real identity is a surprise, but the twist of an ending is not really believable and in no way matches the twists of SCREAM OF FEAR.

All in all, THE ICONS OF HORROR is a collection of Hammer films worth adding to your own collection. SCREAM OF FEAR and THE GORGON are the top-liners, but the others are not really shabby. They all just remind us of what the little British studio was able to add to a decade or more of horror greats. It's unfortunate that VAMPIRE CIRCUS and TWINS OF EVIL are only available from foreign markets, and even then in limited supply. Come back, Hammer. We miss you.",1249948800,2,7736,4.582791033984092
3487172,4,B001B9ZVVC,"The Gorgon (Terence Fisher, 1964)

The Gorgon is classic Hammer horror; in fact, it could probably be considered archetypal. Director Terence Fisher, one of Hammer's stalwarts, and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee on opposite ends of the stick? That's about as Hammer as it gets, and the quality of the thing goes without saying.

Paul Heitz (The Watcher in the Woods' Richard Pasco) arrives in a small, unnamed town in Europe sometime in the early part of the 20th century to investigate the mysterious deaths of his father and brother, believed to have been caused by the mysterious Dr, Namaroff (Cushing). Heitz isn't entirely sure Namaroff is as guilty as he's believed to be, but it's quite possible he's being influenced by Namaroff's sexy assistant Carla (Blind Corner's Barbara Shelley). He starts to hear tales of the title character, Megaera. Think of her as a sister of Medusa--one look and you'll be turned to stone. When Heitz finds himself too confused to go on, his old professor Meister (Lee), an old adversary of Namaroff's, shows up.

And that's when the film really begins, no matter how good the rest of it has been (and that is good indeed)--when Cushing and Lee play against one another, as they often did. I've wondered idly for years why Cushing and Lee aren't mentioned in the same breath as, say, Laurel and Hardy. It may not be comedy, but it was a classic partnership all the same, and when the two of them showed up in the same movie--especially as adversaries--magic happened. Both are top-quality actors, of course, and here they're backed up by a cast as solid as one could put together in a movie in Britain in the sixties; Shelley was at the top of her game, one of Hammer's biggest draws as well as being a TV star at the same time, while Pasco was known as a Shakespearean actor. This is not your typical low-budget horror flick by any means, and Fisher was arguably Hammer's best director, having done pretty much everything in his career--not only horror, but mystery, comedy, adventure, fantasy, drama, pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. While there have obviously been cases of directors becoming masters through specialization, it's been my experience recently that it's the guys who know how to combine everything through personal experience who do the best job with cross-contamination (think about, for example, comic timing in a horror film, or handling a mystery angle in a comedy). The Gorgon, while obviously a horror film, has both mystery and fantasy elements (as well as the romance), and it's all blended nicely into a cracking good movie. If you're a young horror fan and have somehow not yet discovered the treasure trove that is the Hammer Films collection, The Gorgon is a great place to start. ****",1248739200,4,2766,4.843551797040169
3487173,5,B001B9ZVVC,"I've always been more of a Universal Horror fan, but Hammer studios did have style and I enjoy many of their horror films! I saw The Gorgon as a kid in a theater and I have always remembered it fondly.

Horror fans have wanted a DVD release of The Gorgon for years and the wait has paid off. The prints here look crisp and clear! While 'The Gorgon' film is short on action, it does have a lot of atmosphere. It's just a shame the make-up isn't more inspired as I think the idea of a Gorgon is very haunting. The visual here just doesn't measure up.

Probably the best film in the lot is 'Scream Of Fears' which is one I never saw before owning this set. It's a creepy murder mystery ghost story with some good scares.

'The Two Faces Of Dr, Jekyll' is an interesting take on the familiar story with Mr. Hyde being ugly and evil minded more than physically.

The worst film by far is 'The Curse Of The Mummy's Tomb' which is a pretty boring entry in the Mummy series with no Mummy action until two thirds of the film have elapsed! Lee and Cushing are sorely missed here too!

The DVD transfer prints are really nice with hardly any wear what so ever. It would have been nice to have commentaries and featurettes for these films, but at least the trailers are present for all four films.

The films are:

Curse of the Mummy's Tomb(1964)-Not bad Mummy thriller,not up to the previous ""The Mummy""(1959),but enjoyable enough with a bizarre plot about a Mummy prince who returns with revenge on the mind and a bizarre twist in the plot involving the Mummy's still alive(!)brother who had murdered him many years before. The leading lady is cute and the Mummy sequences are fun,but this is not one of Hammer's best.

Scream of Fear(1962)-Hammer's first and most succesful Psycho rip-off features a twisted tale of a beautiful cripple who returns to see her father after over ten years apart,only to discover him missing and her suspicions of her stepmother.
Black and White and well directed with a particularly surprising ending,this is the biggest surprise of the set.
Christopher Lee plays an effcetive red herring with a french accent!

The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll(1962)-One of Hammer's few financial disasters of there classic period is a very different version of the classic story.
Hammer's greatest director,Terence Fisher handles admirably the transistion,creating a story revolving around a impotent and old Dr. Jekyll(Paul Massey) who when taking a potion turns into a young,ammoral,Hyde!
Massey is pretty good,but Christopher Lee steals as his friend,a ruthless gambler who is romancing Jekyll's estranged wife.
It was a good idea,but the film just does not rank among the best adaptions of the story,or of Hammer's best Gothics.
Though there is lots of violence and sex,that is pretty showy for the early 60s(Get a load of Hyde's babe of a mistress,an exotic dancer who uses a snake in her act!)

The Gorgon(1964)-A great concept that focuses on the legend of the Gorgon,which was the snake haired woman who turned people to stone in Greek Mythology,is featured here terrorizing a Swiss village.
Peter Cushing,for once,is NOT the good guy and Christopher Lee is a hero! Barbera Shelly is lovely and there are many creepy moments,even if the effects are not always up to par,this is still a must see Hammer.

In fact, in the 1940s, outside of Val Lewton's films (Cat People, I Walked With a Zombie, et al), horror was pretty much a spent genre.  In the 1950s, however, Hammer Films in England resurrected horror in a big way, bringing back the Universal monsters in new versions of familiar tales.  Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee took the place of Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney; perhaps more significantly, color replaced black-and-white, allowing a more vivid depiction of violence that may seem tame nowadays, but was shocking at the time.

The biggest of these Hammer horror films include Curse of Frankenstein, The Mummy and The Horror of Dracula.  The Hammer Films - Icon of Horror Collection, however, contains some lesser known efforts, with four movies on two discs.

Disc One has The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll and The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb.  The former movie is another re-telling of the familiar Jekyll-and-Hyde story; while it pales in comparison to the Frederic March version, this movie does offer a couple twists.  In particular, in this case Hyde is actually the better-looking of the pair, a suave though completely amoral playboy.  Jekyll is married to a faithless wife who loves Christopher Lee, another suave and amoral playboy who is also Jekyll's best friend, setting up an interesting triangle (or is it a square?).

The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is another version of the familiar mummy tale with the mummy wreaking vengeance on those who violated its tomb.  The twist regards the human villain who guides the mummy; though most viewers will have this character pegged quite early, his motives take a while to be revealed.  This movie is also the only one in the set not to have Lee in the cast.

Disc Two has The Gorgon and Scream of Fear.  The Gorgon has not only Lee in a rare heroic role, but also Peter Cushing.  The title monster is a sister of the more famous Medusa but with a similar look and powers.  Similar to a werewolf, the Gorgon only appears at the full moon.  Cushing is the local doctor who knows more about the Gorgon than he is willing to say, and Lee is a professor who helps solve the mystery.

While these three films fit into the standard Hammer monster stories, Scream of Fear is distinctly different, a non-supernatural horror mystery.  Hammer did several of these movies that were all in black-and-white and were reminiscent of Hammer's pre-horror days when it made B-film noirs.  Other examples include Nightmare and Paranoiac.  In Scream of Fear, Susan Strasberg plays a young wheelchair-bound woman moving back to her father's home after a decade abroad.  When she gets back, her father is gone on a trip, leaving her only with his new wife.  After some strange goings-on, including seeing what she believes is her dad's corpse, she suspects something sinister afoot; can she, with the help of the chauffeur, figure out what's going on?  Lee is in this movie as a local doctor who seems to get along a little too well with the step-mother.  Though it is the atypical member of this set, Scream of Fear is also the best in the set.

As seems typical with most Hammer DVD releases, these films come with little in the way of extras, merely the theatrical trailers.  None of these movies are bad, though the Disc One films are slower-moving; the Disc Two films, however, are pretty good.  In fact, though these are clearly lesser Hammer movies, this is still a fun set that should be enjoyed by most Hammer fans.",1226188800,,3688,4.747252747252747

Hammer added another 'classic' monster with Terence Fisher's THE GORGON (1964). Filled with chilling menace, the film is set in the Transylvanian village of Vandorf, terrorized by a series of killings in which the victims have turned to STONE. The Gorgon, Magaera, is found in the nearby ruins of the Castle Borski, but the discoverer is himself turned to stone, having just time to summon help in the form of his son and his son's tutor, Professor Meinster ( Christopher Lee, in a fine set of whiskers and playing for once, the avenger )! Eventually the Gorgon, is found to be in possession of the beautiful Carla Hoffman (Barbara Shelly) assistant and ex-patient of the sinister Professor Namaroff ( Peter Cushing ).

3487189,4,B001B9ZVVC,"Horror fans are well aware of the iconic position that Britain's Hammer Film Productions holds in the history of horror cinema, but most would agree that it's a bit of a stretch for Sony/Columbia to have included these four films in their Icons of Horror series.  While these flicks are not without their merits, critics and fans alike agree that all four films are essentially second-string examples from the overall Hammer catalog and are not, therefore, icons of horror in and of themselves.  Nonetheless, it's cool that Sony/Columbia has made these less-than-stellar films available in such a reasonably priced two-disc DVD set, and ardent fans of Hammer horror will definitely want to add the set to their collections.

THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL (1960), the first film in this set, was initially panned by critics for being slow paced and poorly directed, yet it actually offers an interesting twist on the familiar Robert Louis Stevenson story and contains some superb acting.  In this interpretation, instead of being a handsome and successful doctor whose self-inflicted experimentation turns him into an ugly brute, the good doctor is a dull, ordinary-looking milquetoast who turns into a suave, handsome libertine after ingesting a chemistry-set concoction. (It wouldn't be unreasonable to argue that this treatment served as the inspiration for the 1963 Jerry Lewis parody THE NUTTY PROFESSOR and its later remake, both of which also used the ugly-duckling-to-beautiful-swan idea.)  Canadian actor Paul Massie delivers very convincing and affecting performances as both Jekyll and his evil alter ego Hyde, and Hammer regular Christopher Lee is delightful in a supporting role.  And as with all Hammer films, there are also plenty of pretty women with heaving bosoms.  In fact, the only truly egregious flaw in THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL is the special FX makeup--the visual difference between Jekyll and Hyde is achieved solely via the presence of facial hair (Jekyll) or the lack thereof (Hyde), and it therefore becomes difficult for viewers to suspend disbelief and accept the idea that the denizens of Jekyll's world can't tell that he and Hyde are one in the same.

The second film in the set, 1964's THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB, comes closer to being a remake of Universal's classic Karloff vehicle THE MUMMY (1932) than did Hammer's 1959 film of the same name.  Yet, as with most mummy-centric horror films, this flick is little more than a collection of cliches based on the myths and misconceptions that originated with the discovery and opening of King Tut's tomb in the early 1920s.  Maybe it's because I hold a degree in Art History and have extensively studied the art of ancient Egypt, but the props and production design for this Hammer flick are historically and aesthetically inaccurate and therefore seem unconvincing to me.  And if that's not enough, even the FX makeup on the titular monster looks technically more primitive than that with which Jack Pierce covered Boris Karloff nearly 32 years prior!  Admittedly, THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB is mildly entertaining despite its flaws, but there is really nothing outstanding or groundbreaking about the film.

The third offering in this set, 1964's THE GORGON, is probably the least entertaining of the four.  Inspired by the Greco-Roman myth about the feminine creatures whose gazes could turn men to stone, the film is almost unbearably slow paced and, with the exception of the anticipated decapitation at the denouement, wholly uneventful.  As always, regular Hammer thespians Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing give it their best, and director Terence Fisher and his crew do a pretty good job of creating the moody, depressing Gothic atmosphere for which Hammer films are famous, but the material they are forced to work with is a creative albatross that they just can't ultimately overcome.  The only really notable thing about THE GORGON is that it marks the first high-profile role in a Hammer film for actor Patrick Troughton, who here plays the chief of police in the town where the Gorgon resides.  Troughton would go on to play supporting roles in a few other Hammer films, after which he would achieve international stardom playing the second incarnation of the titular character in TV's DOCTOR WHO.  Horror fans might also recognize Troughton from his later role as the priest who gets impaled by a lightning rod in THE OMEN (1976).

SCREAM OF FEAR (1961), the fourth and final entry in this DVD set, was actually released in the UK (where it was made) under the moniker TASTE OF FEAR.  It tells the story of a wheelchair-bound heiress who, at the invitation of her estranged father, arrives at the family estate only to discover that her father is conspicuously absent and that her stepmother is behaving rather suspiciously. Just when she becomes convinced that her father has been murdered and that her stepmother and family friends are conspiring to cheat her out of her inheritance, everything takes an interesting twist.  Unlike the other three flicks in this ""icons of horror"" set from Sony/Columbia, SCREAM OF FEAR noticeably lacks the usual accoutrements of a horror film, and it would therefore be more acurate to describe it as a thriller or a mystery.  Nonetheless, the tightly plotted story, excellent acting (including an early performance by American actress Susan Strasberg, who portrays the heiress), and skilled directing make it the best film of the lot, and it alone is worth amazon.com's price of admission.

The digital transfers of the films in this set are clean and crisp, all films are presented in their original aspect ratios (enhanced for widescreen TVs), and the sound quality is pretty good.  The discs also include the original theatrical trailers for each film, but those are the only extras. While these films might not actually qualify as icons of horror in and of themselves, the studio that produced them, Hammer Film Productions, will always stand as an icon in the history of horror cinema.  So all in all, this DVD set will make a fine addition to the collections of true fans of Hammer horror, and even fans of good mystery movies might want to pick up a set just to get a copy of the excellent SCREAM OF FEAR.",1225756800,,6253,5.000963391136802
3487190,3,B001B9ZVVC,"The Brits have a way with the horror film, a respect for the genre and a sense of fun that we yanks would do well to emulate.  In these Hammer films, as in most British productions, don't look for millions in production values; instead check out the imagination and style. There's The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb, with the usual Egyptian claptrap flashback and stalwart American actor Fred Clark as a greedy showman out to get his comeuppance. The Two Faces of Dr Jekyll, with Christopher Lee as a loyal friend to the two-faced doctor played by Paul Massie, boasts an interesting switch: Jekyll is the hairy slob, while the evil Hyde is squeaky-clean and wildly malevolent. The Gorgon, with Lee and Peter Cushing.  is pretty silly, but there are lot of thrills and suspense as the ancient Greek demon goes for gruesome revenge.  Scream of Fear is the most interesting outing in the collection, featuring a translucently beautiful Susan Strasberg, daughter of acting teacher Lee and Marilyn Monroe guru Paula, and creepy goings-on in a mansion whose swimming pool holds a frightening secret. OK, so this quartet  may not be the most magnificent examples of cinema genius, but they'll help to keep the post-Halloween horror going while offering up a good scare, or a good laugh, once in a while.",1225670400,4,1291,4.828054298642534

""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" I think is very poor, despite some good acting; the least exciting of all the 'Jekyll and Hyde' movies.

We who are hearing impaired thank Sony for the subtitles.  Commentaries would've been nice, especially for those who have a favorite film in this collection.  The restoration is superb and the audio is strong and clear for all four features.  ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" and ""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" are presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1; ""The Gorgon"" and ""Scream of Fear"" are presented in 1.66:1.  Except for ""Scream of Fear,"" all features are in beautiful color.  The black and white print is clear and sharp for ""Scream of Fear.""  Too bad it wasn't in color.  Overall, the DVD presentation is very good.  Now for the review:

  Hammer Film Productions was famous for their gothic horror films.  This is a superb collection and introduction for anyone unfamiliar with Hammer.  Horror icon Christopher Lee (most famous for his role as Dracula) is in three of the films.  Other horror legends include Peter Cushing, Barbara Shelly, Susan Strasberg, and Oliver Reed.  All four movies involve monsters, primarily humans who have become monsters, whether physically or intellectually.  Also, in these films, the viewer doesn't know who the real monster is.  (The films are rife with betrayal.)  A monster can be anyone.  Sometimes they are normal in appearance.  I promise you no plot spoilers as I briefly describe the monster scenario in each of these highly rated classic gems.

  ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" - Aging Dr. Jekyll drinks his potion and becomes a younger, more handsome man who wishes to be free of all responsibility for his amoral actions.  (Don't we all wish we could live like that?  Isn't there a monster in all of us?)  Masquerading as Dr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll learns that his gorgeous wife and best friend (Lee) are traitorous monsters.

  ""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb."" - Ra, the Egyptian Prince, has been resurrected by an evil person who possesses an amulet.  Who are they and why are they seeking to destroy everyone around them?  The real monster is the one who is controlling the unfortunate mummy.

  ""The Gorgon.""  Both Lee and Cushing star as a doctor and a professor, respectively, who are seeking to destroy the monster who turns innocent villagers into stone with their gaze.  Unfortunately, the monster may actually be a respected member of the community.

  ""Scream of Fear.""  This ""Hitchcock""-like thriller stars Susan Strasberg as a crippled young woman; for the first time in ten years, she is visiting her wealthy father who lives on the French Riviera.  Someone in the household is a monster who is trying to drive her insane.  Quite a good mystery with many surprises.

  In fact, all four films are mysterious, gloomy, creepy, and shocking.  I'm surprised these haven't already been released on DVD in America.  They are truly excellent horror classics.  I can't tell you which one is my favorite.  For having been made in the 1960s, these films contain violence that is surprisingly graphic and shocking.  Also, certain scenes in ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" had language and sexual innuendoes that were hilarious.

  This collection is a must have for fans of gothic horror from Hammer Film Productions.  I'm very glad I bought it.  Try to take it away from me and I'll turn into a monster.",1224460800,75,3408,4.878947368421053
3487193,5,B001B9ZVVC,"Amazed to discover not only have the ""hells"" and ""whores"" on the dialogue track been restored in this version of The Two Faces of Dr Jekyll, but at least three scenes that had been trimmed by the censor have also been restored. The uncut ending of Maria's snake dance is pretty bold stuff for the early 60's and it's hard to imagine that Hammer thought they could slip this by the British or American censors. The two other restored moments are also scenes with the snake dancer, Maria.

I've always found The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll a compelling reworking of the Stevenson novella, and as others have noted, Christopher Lee gives one of his best performances in an unusual bit of casting. Unfortunately the picture never really knows what to do with its unique premise of a dull bearded Dr Jekyll and a young handsome Mr Hyde. The original script was for a two hour movie and before shooting began was cut down to a more typical Hammer running time of under 90 minutes. Cutting that much material out of the script may be the reason this version never really comes together dramatically.

But it's difficult to know without reading, if the longer script would have made a better picture. The original screenplay ended with the execution of  Dr Jekyll. His neck in the hangman's noose, Jekyll is dropped through the gallows' door and as the dead man's body swings into view, we see the face of Mr Hyde. It's a stronger ending, but doesn't magically pull the picture together.

The Two Faces isn't a horror film and it's not written or directed as a horror film. Maybe the problem is that we expect a horror film and the movie isn't powerful enough to convince us it isn't a horror film.

Even with the script problems, The Two Faces is one of Hammer's most elaborate productions with a number of very compelling scenes and strong performances. Terence Fisher's direction is bold and assured, although for some reason Fisher has been blamed for the picture's short comings. But it seems apparent the problem is with the script, not the direction.  For all it's flaws, it's one of Hammer's most unusual pictures and I can't help but like it a lot.

Scream of Fear is the first and best of Hammer's psychological thrillers, with a few tense scenes that still hold up 47 years later. Although you might find one of the most ""shocking"" moments is a quiet but sexually charged scene between Ann Todd and Ronald Lewis near the end of the movie.

The Gorgon tries hard to be the kind of  horror film its title suggests, but fortunately fails miserably. More a tragic romance, in some strange way the picture rises above it's limited premise. Probably because Terence Fisher's direction emphasis the romantic and plays down as much of the conventional horror shtick as possible.  But it's an uphill battle since the script is filled with cliches.

As for Columbia's restoration of these pictures, for some reason The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll is way over saturated. Maybe it's my set, but nothing else looks over saturated except these recent Hammer releases from Columbia and that includes the two pirate pictures on the Icons of Adventure disc. Jack Asher's photography was always bold, but it didn't look cartoon-ish which is what I'm seeing on my set. Turning color down on my set helps a lot. But can't do much about the red leaning color correction . . . skin tones are way too ruddy and this might be the limits of what can be restored with a faded print. Neither Warner's nor Universal's Hammer releases have over saturated color, though Warner's The Mummy, in particular, leans too much to red in the skin tones.",1224374400,6,3610,4.669291338582677
3487194,4,B001B9ZVVC,"The packaging on this set is atrocious. The cover shot looks as if somebody ran wild with (Adobe) Illustrator and Photoshop. It looked like the work of one of those labels whose 'best available source material' was a badly worn VHS tape. There are no special features except for the original theatrical trailers. If it hadn't been for the ""Columbia"" and ""Sony"" logos on the rear jacket this one would have stayed on the shelf.

But, that's where the bad news ends. The films have been re-mastered in high definition. The images are pristine. The colour is vibrant. The audio tracks have been re-mastered to stereo. Even the trailers have been cleaned up. The menus are easy to navigate. The set features two gems and a pair of enjoyable films. The price works out to about six bucks per film.

This is a good set and a good value.

Scream of Fear ****

This film evokes images of Hitchcock's better work. Jimmy Sangster's story has plenty of twists and turns. The acting from the principle players is superb. Susan Strasberg delivers a riveting performance. Ann Todd's performance is wonderfully subtle. Christopher Lee shows the range that made him an icon of the genre. Ronald Lewis is both chilling and charming as the man sympathetic to Strasberg's plight.

The technical side of the picture is strong also. Director Seth Holt kept Sangster's narrative moving at a brisk pace. The cinematography and lighting are excellent. The black and white photography is stunning. The score, by Clifton Parker enhances the mood of the film extremely well.

This is an excellent piece of work.

The Gorgon ****

The Gorgon is a wonderfully crafted motion picture. Director Terrence Fisher regarded it as his finest or one of his finest works and he was probably right. It's true that the snakes on the Gorgon's makeup look bad but the blame (likely) lies with the amount of money the crew had to work with. The rubber snakes aside, this film breathtakingly beautiful to watch. The cinematography of Michael Reed is excellent. The design of the production by Bernard Robinson is gorgeous. The lighting (which is uncredited) casts one stunning highlight after another. The colour (by Technicolor) is glorious. J. Llewellyn Devine's story, and John Gilling's adaptation of it, gave the crew plenty to work with.

(Terrence) Fisher's directing knits this web together perfectly. Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee both give fine performances. Barbara Shelley delivers an engaging turn as Cushing's assistant. Michael Goodliffe and Richard Pasco deliver strong characterizations. Even the Village Police Inspector played by Patrick Troughton avoids being a completely one-dimensional figure. There are a few backdrops that aren't convincing and the aforementioned snakes' heads look a little silly but those are small complaints.

This is an example of the genre at its most poetic. It's not to be missed.

The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll **

The take that writer Wolf Mankowitz gave to (Robert Louis) Stevenson's classic is intriguing enough but the narrative never lives up to its original promise. The story bogs down periodically and the characters are often weak. Jekyll' is overwrought and self-righteous. Hyde is an intellectual version of pure evil who can be really stupid. Jekyll's wife is an unsympathetic character. Hyde's lover seems bent on her own destruction. They're all one-dimensional.

Terrence Fisher and the actors around him do what they can but that's limited. Paul Masse does well with the roles of Jekyll and Hyde but he couldn't do the impossible. 'Hyde' is intriguing enough but 'Jekyll' is flat. He spends most of his screen time acting as if he'd be a lot of fun at funerals. Dawn Addams never evokes any sympathy over being caught in a loveless marriage. Norma Marla does pretty well in the role of the women who falls in love with Hyde but she was limited by the script. The only character that's fleshed out thoroughly is the one played by Christopher Lee. He plays the part of an unprincipled leech brilliantly. It's a credit to his talent that he could do so much with limited material.

This isn't a bad film. The story-line is thought provoking and there are some good moments. But, it's inconsistent. And when it's dull, it's dull.

The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb **

This film has plenty of faults. The makeup job on the Mummy is awful. Its head looks like it's made of soggy cardboard. The best parts of the script were borrowed from their first version of the story. The characters are all stock. There's an intrepid academic who bores his girlfriend. There's a bored girlfriend who falls for the charming intellectual. Of course there's a charming intellectual. There's the obligatory Egyptian who warns about the dangers of 'defiling the dead' (who in Egypt always have curse ready for people who do that). And, naturally, there's a huckster in there. How could there not be?

But this crew does a decent job with it. Ronald Howard is wonderfully dull as the academic who'd rather woo women with hieroglyphics than moonlight. Jeanne Roland is a perfect Doe-eyed ingnue. Her character isn't the brightest bulb on the screen but she bats her bonny browns deliciously. Terrence Morgan is slippery, suave, charming and happy to show her the poetry of life. And Fred Clark is delightfully dollar-happy as the promoter looking to put the Mummy under lights. Director and Writer Michael Carreras had the sense to throw in a few surprises. And he did it in ways that don't seem contrived.

When the cardboard-headed Mummy finally does run loose there are some chilling moments. The pace set by Carreras is brisk one. His story, though not particularly original, seldom drags. The cinematography and production design by Otto Heller and Bernard Robinson are good. The action scenes are convincing.

This isn't a great film (or even a particularly good one) but it has one thing going for it: it's fun.",1224374400,29,5915,4.944556451612903
3487195,4,B001B9ZVVC,"Three of these 60's Hammers have great-looking color and blemish-free prints.  'Scream of Fear' is black and white and has a grainier print that is still quite satisfactory.

'The Gorgon' is the best of the four.  Director Terence Fisher has given it the same stylish treatment as his Dracula films, and it is likewise set in Transylvania country, or close.  The atmosphere is eerie and the coldness and remoteness of the region really come across well.  And, what a cast.
Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee alone would be sufficient for a recommendation.  Actually, Lee has a smaller role than usual here, though he is  professional as always.  Barbara Shelley brings a highly individual beauty and fragility to her role as Cushing's nurse, and Richard Pasco is excellent as a student seeking answers over his father's and brother's deaths.
'The Gorgon' may not have the best special effects of all time, but I really have no complaints.

'The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb' is pretty enjoyable, though I would rank it third, behind Hammer's 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy's Shroud' in terms of the studio's Mummy forays. (I am not familiar with 'Blood from the Mummy's Tomb'.)  The best thing about 'Curse' is Fred Clark's greedy American businessman.  I would place Clark in a tie with Forrest Tucker's ugly American from 'The Abominable Snowman' as to which of them is the least sensitive and most politically incorrect.  I do think 'Curse' would have been better had Fisher directed.  Michael Carreras's work makes the movie look more like a competent TV thriller, albeit with good production design.

'The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll' has a pretty interesting spin on Robert Louis Stevenson's story and a good evocation of 1890's London.  The cast is good--didn't know Christopher Lee could play a compulsive gambler/gigolo so well--and Paul Massie is acceptable in the title role(s).  Dawn Addams plays unfaithful wives as well as anyone I have seen.  One look at her and you immediately know her husband needs a good lawyer.  The biggest problem with 'Two Faces' is, once past the initial premise the plot quickly becomes rather routine.

'Scream of Fear' was written by Hammer staple Jimmy Sangster, and if you liked the movies 'Nightmare' or 'Paranoiac' this one is on a par.  It's impossible to guess where the plot goes in 'Scream' and credibility does get pushed a bit far, but since it's Hammer it's not like we're asking for a story ripped from the headlines.

Unlike 'Icons of Adventure' this set has no extras.  Still, the price is reasonable for four movies issued in mostly outstanding quality prints.

Just about all the Hammer I had been waiting for is now on DVD. The one I'm still missing is 1965's 'She', which I thought was excellent and needs to be issued in Region 1.",1224374400,3,2781,4.857749469214437
3487196,4,B001B9ZVVC,"Sort of like the ""B"" side of Hammer Film's greatest hits, ""Hammer Films: Four Creepy Classics"" is a blast and, in some cases, surpasses some of the film company's better known classics.  In order to truly appreciate these films, it may help to have viewed them as a child (when they had more power to terrify), or, at least, to watch them without the expectation of non-stop action and graphic gore that typifies most horror films in today's market.

First up is ""Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"", the first sequel to Hammer's 1959 Peter Cushing classic, ""The Mummy"" (itself a remake of, and improvement upon, a number of Universal horror flicks of the 1940's).  ""Curse"" once again finds blasphemous archaeologists desecrating the tomb of an ancient pharaoh, with the usual mayhem resulting after an American showman (Fred Clark channeling P.T. Barnum) decides to take the gauze-covered mummy on a roadshow exhibition.  After the usual suspects get wind of this, they resurrect the dusty fellow, who cuts a murderous swath through London before beauty and innocence prove to be his undoing. Terence Morgan, Ronald Howard (no relation to the director), and Jeanne Roland round out the perfectly acceptable cast.  Not great, but still quite fun, ""Curse"" may suffer in comparison to its predecessor, but it's still better than the tired Mummy retreads that Universal has been belching out lately.

""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" is a surprisingly sexy (for its time) look at the infamous doctor and his alter-ego's sordid doings.  Beautiful cinematography and a good cast enhance this story about stuffy Doctor J's transformation into good-looking, sophisticated, man-about-town, Mr. Hyde (both excellently played by Paul Massie).  While the good doctor's wife (Dawn Addams) canoodles with his best friend (Christopher Lee), Mr. Hyde hooks up with a snake-charmer in a colorful den of iniquity overseen by bouncer Oliver Reed (in an early screen role).  Everyone is lusty and having a grand old time (except for poor old Jekyll) until Hyde's nasty temper begins getting the better of him, and then it's curtains for a number of characters.  This is, perhaps, my favorite film on the DVD, although the scene where a seemingly agile, healthy adult stands perfectly still and screams while an extremely slow-moving python slithers over to dispatch said victim is irritatingly ludicrous.

""The Gorgon"" pairs Hammer faves Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee as two Eastern European doctors at odds with one another as they try to track down the mysterious titular creature responsible for a number of deaths in the local village.  Flame-haired Barbara Shelley co-stars as Cushing's beautiful nurse, with Richard Pasco on hand as her suitor.  There are some slow moments in ""The Gorgon"", and the monster, herself, is best seen when reflected in mirrors and pools of water, because the make-up department didn't do anyone any favors with this get-up of rubber snakes and bloodshot eyeballs.  Still, it's a pretty good film with high production values, decent acting, and a certain amount of suspense.

All in all, I thought ""Scream of Fear""--not a horror film, per se--was the creepiest film of the bunch.  A wheelchair-bound American heiress (Susan Strasberg) arrives at the French Riviera estate of her estranged father, only to find him missing and her stepmother (Ann Todd) acting suspiciously cozy with the local doctor (Christopher Lee, again, adopting a French accent).  The only one of the four movies to be filmed in black and white, ""Scream of Fear"" has a weird, scary quality that recalls such low budget shockers as ""Dementia 13"" and ""Paranoiac""; there's something claustrophobic about that black-and-white estate that invites cautious looks over the shoulder when characters enter darkened rooms they know they should stay out of.  Though not as bloody and violent as ""Dementia 13"" and its ilk (which are tame by today's standards), ""Scream of Fear"" succeeds in creeping out the viewer with what it doesn't show.  Again, the acting is first-rate with both Strasberg and Todd, in totally opposing roles, giving sympathetic performances, and Lee and actor, Ronald Lewis, fine as the male stand-bys.  Again, I was bothered by a perfectly ludicrous scene in this film, when one character is brutally (and unnecessarily) killed while the rest of the cast hovers around the edges, waiting to ""make their move"".

While they have certainly produced better films in the past, the four included on this collection are more than worthy of Hammer's growing DVD canon and a nice addition for collectors.",1224288000,3,4584,5.1426648721399735
3487197,5,B001B9ZVVC,"This is truly a nice gift for the Halloween season.  Hammer films of England has been a great purveyor of gothic horror movies during the 1950s and 1960s.  This collection is fairly representative of Hammer's work from 1959 through 1964.  The presentation of the films in this DVD package was very clear and crisp.  The colors were simply sumptuous!  I first saw the Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll in a VHS tape.  The colors and the look were very faded and muddy.  In this DVD, we saw the film as if we were at the movie theater back in 1959.  The other three films also look great.  Kudos goes to Sony Pictures for the great work done in making these four films available for our viewing pleasure!  Finally, it should be noted that all four films are available with closed captions and also have English subtitles for those who are hearing impaired.  I only wished the folks at Universal who produced that horrendous DVD package of The Hammer Horror Series (Brides of Dracula, Curse of the Werewolf, etc.), with its flawed and mostly unviewable disks, used the same care which Sony did with this DVD collection.  The only problem with this Sony collection is that only trailers are available as special features.  But, hey, it is great to have these Hammer films finally in DVD.  I look forward to seeing more Hammer classics coming out in the future.",1224288000,8,1346,4.600840336134453
