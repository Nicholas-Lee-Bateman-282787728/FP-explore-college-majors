2207994,4,B00079I0B0,"Alright...the first 2 episodes would throw any Yaoi Fan off - with that damn disguiting Queen shoving her sons in her giantic boobs (WTF?! The anime is supposed to be for a female audience!! Who the hell wants to see that??) but if you just ignore the first 2 and go to the last 3, it's a great anime. I love Wolfram's attitude toward Yuri dancing with a 7 year old girl and he is jealous. It's so sweet. There's lots of Bishonen and lovely slashy bits, but it is disappointing that it isn't Shonen Ai right now and still they shove in chicks to ruin good Yaoiful moments.",1116633600,4,572,4.256880733944954
2207995,5,B00079I0B0,"This anime is incredibly amusing and addicting. After a billion girl is stuck in alternate universe, we get a guy.

Yuuri is a great main character because he never gets annoying and whiny like some of the other heroines do when faced with similar situations ( uhhh...English translation of Kagome, anyone?)  Basically almost all the main characters are male, all outrageously good looking that they cannot help but ""interact with eacother"".

This is one of those shows that you can predict and for all we know, may go on forever. There are so many quirks and situations that lead to the funniest outcomes possible. But, all in all, it's a comedy in which they make fun of everything. I wouldn't consider it shounen-ai per say. There are shonen-ai situations but they are used for humor purposes.

For example: the engament between Yuuri and Wolfram is on going thourghout the series, but is never taken up seriously.  (though I wish they admit it already!)  But there is still hope! the series is not over yet and all we can do is pray. Since Yuuri is only 15, there's still time for him to wake up and realize what's in front of him.

I can't wait for volume 2, the story is going to get even more crazier!",1115510400,,1208,4.564814814814815
2207996,5,B00079I0B0,"I've watched quite a bit of this show in Japanese, though I haven't seen the DVD yet. As much as I enjoy yaoi, it was a huge break from the average show.

First off there's Yuuri. He's a happy, go-lucky high school student. He has both his parents (a rare thing in anime, indeed! Usually they vanish into thin air), but his mom seems to say unusual things. Like, ""Remember this in case you ever end up on another planet where there are strange creatures"". Hnn, nothing suspicious there.

As all the reviews say, Yuuri ends up flushed into another dimension where he's the demon king. How do they know he's the demon king? Well, he has black hair, black eyes, and he's wearing all black (his school uniform). So he must be the demon king, right?

Yuuri meets a lot of fun characters in the new world. There's Conrad, who is practically his babysitter and very happily so. Gunter, who couldn't be more flaming if he was set on fire. Gwendal, who always seems to have a very intense look no matter what's going on. And, of course, Wolfram, who forms an extreme love-hate relationship with Yuuri.

Besides the main characters, there's also females in this show that have strong roles. Many anime females, such as Miaka, leave a lot to be desired. Even though this show may be based around quite a bit of shounen-ai, the supporting female cast lends a generous hand to the action, being funny, strong and witty.

The series was made based off of novels, so much of the show is dialogue driven. The characters all play off each other well. The characters also grow as the series goes on.

The first season is 39 episodes, and the second is said to also be 39 episodes, which would make this about 78 episodes total at the end. That might be good or bad for some people. Many new series (Paranoia Agent, for example) seem to be getting quite short. As long as they keep up the quality of this series throughout it should be no problem getting through 78 episodes.",1115424000,5,1956,4.480337078651686
2207997,5,B00079I0B0,"I preordered this title because it looked interesting and just got it in. After watching all of the episodes on my dvd had to offer I have to say I absolutely fell in love with this series. It's premise is somewhat like Fushigi Yugi, only with a guy, and it's not a book, it's a toilet. Yes, toilet. And you thought there was never anything good about recieving a swirlie! The boy finds himself in a new land where humans and demons who look remarkably like one another are fighting and he is supposedly the legendary demon king. Definitely fills my quota for action, magic and sorcery, and with more yummy bishounen than you can shake a stick at. Did I forget to mention that when he slaps a member of the aristocracy he beguns engaged to that person? That MALE person? For fans of shonen ai, and anime alike, this title has is all. I personally can't wait until the next segment is out on dvd and I can get my paws on it.",1114473600,3,923,4.28
2207998,5,B00079I0B0,"Let me start this off by saying, that this show is by far the funniest thing I have ever seen. No joking. It is about a boy named Yuri, who is accidentally flushed down the toilet. Upon waking in another realm, Yuri is convinced that he fell into a theme park. Soon he will realize how wrong he is. In this new world he is king. Not just king, but the Demon King. He also finds himself in an unlikely engagement. This one has it all. A fantasy setting, fighting action, pretty boys, and lots of shounen-ai goodness. This show is like the crazy love child of Gravitation, and Fushigi Yugi. I hope you love it as well.",1114214400,3,616,4.228813559322034
2207999,5,B00079I0B0,"I have not seen the DVD release because, well it hasn't been released, but I have seen the raw Japanese show. With that said...

When thinking of Kyou Kara Maou (maou being the correct way to write it) think Fushigi Yuugi on crack. With that said, Meet Yuuri, a normal high school boy, right? Or is he. After standing up for a classmate, some bullies take him into the woman's bathroom and flush him down the toilet!? And what's this? The toilet is connected to another world. That's right. You have now entered the crazy happenings of Kyou Kara Maou. Will Yuuri survive in this new world? Will he be able to tell the difference between a slap in the face and a marriage proposal? Only time will tell.

All in all, I would have to give this show a 5 out of 5 stars.  Not only does it keep you laughing, but also has a great story.  However, I do think this is going to be one of those never-ending shows.  Something like DBZ, or Inuyasha that drags on forever.  If you don't like those kinds of shows, I wouldn't recommend this.  There are also hints of male-male relationships or yaoi.  For those of you that hear male-male relationships and it makes you gag.  This is also not for you.  However if none of the two upset you, and you want some good anime comedy.  I would order this DVD.",1105228800,,1288,4.3029045643153525
2208000,4,B00079I0B0,"I love the serious and angsty anime titles, but after a while, just before I  also become suicidal, I need to watch something light and breezy. Something funny, full of attractive guys to remind me that anime does have another side - a side without depressed teenagers and giant robots. And that is where Kyo Kara Maoh comes in...
This is the kind of anime that makes you feel all warm inside without being cheesy or  over-emotional. One of the main attractions of this series is that, unlike others, it does not take itself seriously. Yes, this is another series about a teenager being transported to another world to find himself a leader & hero in another world. However, when was the last time the hero was transported down a flushed toilet? One who cannot ride a horse, control his powers, and, by not knowing the customs of the land, finds himself engaged to another guy (and he is purely into girls!).
Also, to make matters worse, the poor guy finds himself not the romantic hero who used to defeat dragons with a heavenly sword in ancient lore  - but a demon king whose enemies are humans and are charged is protecting dragons who are now an endangered species!
The series does have serious storylines but they  are all created with a lightness of touch and are broken up my comic moments. The guys are all good looking, bishonen characters. There are various degrees are shonen-ai, and I personally love the gorgeous love stricken teacher Gunter. However, any boy-boy love issues are only side stories and are played for laughes.
I really recommend this series if you want something funny to cheer up your day or are having withdrawl symtoms from the wonderful Full Metal Panic series. Another plus is that the first few discs have 5 episodes on so you really do get your monies worth (not like some other series - yes Inuyasha, I am looking at you!). Recommended.",1138147200,15,1873,4.649546827794562
2208001,5,B00079I0B0,"the impression I got from hearing about this series online was a comedic shonen-ai series, but when I finally watched it I found a shojo comedy/action that hooked me at the get go! altho there are some boylove elements it's focused on them enough to make the series a true shonen-ai/boylove series, as they're mostly used for comedic purposes. the action it top notch, and if you love swordfights you'll have enough here to keep you happy. as for the comedy, it's wacky, zany, and all around great! all the characters are pretty well-rounded and have their quirks (gotta love a character with a good quirk).

what really hooked me on this series, however, was the fact that it has a good compelling plot to go with it. you just don't expect to see something with zany comedy AND a plot with a good ammount of deapth to it - especially when they work together without the comedy negatively impacting the plot and vice-versa. even the ""filler"" eps that pop up in this series have plot value, as they develop the characters more. I highly reccomend trying out this series!",1136851200,,1069,4.626315789473685
2208002,3,B00079I0B0,"In many cultures, it is believed that water is a gateway to other worlds. But even with that in mind, the idea of getting ""flushed"" down a toilet is traumatic enough without being taken to a new world. When this happens to Yuri he is indeed troubled but even more so when he is told that he is the new Demon King. With such an odd beginning to a series, Kyo Kara Maoh! promises to be very interesting with some off the wall humor.

Yuri is a fairly average Japanese high school boy with a very strong love for baseball and aside from being told that the Greater Demon Kingdom is his real world, he's lived a fairly normal life.  In this new world, he is a member of the Demon Tribe with his black hair and black eyes and his black high school uniform marks him as a member of royalty plus, the Demon tribe is at war with humans. The culture shock that Yuri experiences is incredible with very strange new customs, which get him into a bit of trouble.  But luckily, Yuri is not alone in his situation and has several comrades, (Conrad, Gunter, Wolfram, and Gwendell) whom protect and advise him on his duties as king.

The overall look of the series is typical of the normal Shounen ai series with very pretty men and very few but pretty women. Every so often, the animation changes to single watercolor still shots for dramatic impact before switching back to the usual animation.  There is innuendous humor but it is mostly kept off screen and many of the boy love relationships are implied or subtly stated. Of course, there is also the pre-requisite rpg game, and magical girl series in-jokes that are expected in this type of storyline. It is overall an enjoyable series with intriguing characters once you get past the boy love.",1134345600,3,1733,4.4715189873417724
2208003,4,B00079I0B0,"One day Yuri is transported to another world.  It is King of the Demon World.  He is surpurised at lots of things.  And he has a strong sence of justice.  He looks like a hero of ""JIDAIGEKI"", a period drama.  For example ""TOOYAMA-no-KINSAN"" ""ZENIGATA-HEIJI""..  Those are same ending and we enjoy that.  ""MAOH"" is not same.  If you study Japanese, please enjoy ""MAOH"" in Japanese. You can feel both present and EDO

period.  I am enjoying Yuri's conversation with his follows.

 But I wanted more the difference of voice between Yuri and the Demon.  That's why 4 stars.",1127606400,4,568,4.673469387755102
2208004,5,B00079I0B0,"This is a very solid Anime, having all of the ingredients which enchant a watcher like me.

There is a hint of adventure, as our `hero' Yuri is abruptly sucked into a semi-medieval world riff with magic and political intrigue.  There is also action, with towns under siege, battles waged, duals undertaken, and just enough kidnappings to keep things interesting.  A flirtatious kind of romance weaves its way through this series, leaving the viewer rooting for one or another character and laughing at the innuendoes - the many, many innuendos.  ;)

The characters are beautifully drawn and have wonderful personalities.  They are a  fun, diverse lot, hopefully to all be fully explored with each new dvd.

But, what ties this Anime together is the humor, which amazingly doesn't distract from the story, but enhances it beautifully.  This is a light hearted, low browed romp through fantasy and relationships, but its okay as that's what it does best!",1126569600,4,952,5.012738853503185
2208005,5,B00079I0B0,"I bought this DVD on the recommandation of one of the myriad of anime magazines that are out there.  I didn't know what I was getting into, but after the first episode had my younger brother and I rolling on the floor, tears coming out of our eyes, laughing; I'm glad that I followed the mags advice.

Not only are the characters beautifully drawn and the story well thought out, but the whole package is more than worth the price paid.  And if you're a fangirl/boy, this is the DVD for you.  Lots of eye candy throughout the whole thing.  Kinda makes me feel all gushy inside.",1124841600,3,577,4.355140186915888
2208006,5,B00079I0B0,"I own and watch pretty decent amount of anime, so when I ran across this one in Best Buy I was intrigued and the summary on the back cover sounded good, so I decided to give it a try.

One thing I must say, it was definetly not dissapointing. It was funny and charming at the beggining, and got even better after Yuri met up with Wolfram, who is very cute and girly looking prince of the lands. After Wolfram's unfriendly confrontation with Yuri, more craziness follows, and the story takes even bigger unexpected turns.

My main approval also goes to the anime art itself. It is a very well drawn anime with good audio sounds, and bright colors.

I have also watched the second part of Kyo Kara Maoh, which also deserved the same credit as the first part. Overall characters are very funny and creative, each helping Yuri along with his new position as the king.

If you are a fan of great anime, this title deserves your attention!

Thanks,

2208007,5,B00079I0B0,"This is a wonderful series from what I have seen thus far. Any shonen ai fangirl will love the cute moments between Gunter and Yuri, Wolfram and Yuri, Conrad and Yuri.. pretty much everyone! Your basic idealistic protagonist tries to make everyone like everyone and not let anyone get hurt story. It's old, I know, but the shonen ai thrown in makes it seem much more origonal. I'm looking forward to the next DVD ^_^",1118102400,2,416,4.56
2208008,5,B00079I0B0,"Okay, I have to admit that I have also not seen the US release of this anime...however, I am going to highly recommend it anyway based on the Japanese version of the show.

Yuuri, a normal 15 year old Japanese boy, while trying to defend a friend from bullies gets warped into another world through a toilet...okay, you're probably thinking, ""what the....?""  I thought so too, but then I watched.  Once over in that ""other world"" there are so many great characters and great stories, you get hooked in right away.  Yuuri is actually the ""maou"" of this world, the king of the demons.  He has dormant powers he never knew existed.  In this world, the humans are actually ganging up on the demons...hmmm...There are a LOT of boy-boy relationships in this anime...be forewarned if that bothers you at all, for me, I love it.  If you loved Gravitation, you will KKM!  There are definately enough different types of guys for all of us fangirls out there.  Yuuri, the hero, everyone wants him, girls and guys alike, but he is standoffish about his true feelings...we just have to wait and see what happens to him.  Conrad, the big brother, cool, calm and collected type, completely dedicated to Yuuri in all aspects.  Wolfram is the adorable, young boy, who is so beautiful he could pass as a girl, but he is strong, though a bit childish, through certain circumstances he becomes Yuuri's fiance.  Gwendal is stern to the point of having a look of complete disgust on his face at all times, but he has a secret soft spot for cute animals^^  Finally, there is Gunter, who is the brains, very, very dedicated to Yuuri, a bit of a cry baby, but also very strong when times call for it.  Yuuri captivates the hearts of all of the above in his own, naive way.  Along the way there are many more characters, though these are the most worth discussing.  The ""other world"" is very middle ages feeling, and though the story is ultimately about the ""moau"" saving this world and bringing peace, it really revolves around the relationships that form between these characters.

All together, this is a great story and a great watch.  Though it is long at 39 episodes, that's okay...you won't even realize the time is slipping by while you watch.  There have been no boring moments.",1117238400,6,2261,4.62155388471178

Every Asuka CL DX manga I've ever seen has been Boys Love & the artist for the manga has other BL/yaoi mangas. Plus, it's a Reverse Harem series, which means Yuri is everyone's love-interest. The manga is possibly slashier than the anime, because conrat is constantly glomping & touching Yuri, & I don't recall him doing that in the anime. By season 2, pretty much every guy he's met has some mild romantic interest in Yuri & Yuri feels very hurt when he learns the real reason Conrat liked him. I think there's a good chance he's going to end up marrying Volfram in the novel. In season 2, & Murata seems to be interested in being more than friends now.

For those who enjoyed watching e.g. Inuyasha, Full Metal Panic, Saiyuki, Maburaho, Tenchi Muyo, Tenjho Tenge, Love Hina, etc.... then you will enjoy this. It does not focus on the gay side much but only really puts it in to provide hilarious moments. Yuri better get better acquainted with the customs in the demon world before he gets in over his head. To think in the demon world if you slap anyone with an open palm on their left cheek it is a marriage proposal. If a knife falls down and you pick it up it is a challenge for a dual and if you pick up a fork (?) and point it at your opponent means you have taken their lover as your own....wierd hah?????
