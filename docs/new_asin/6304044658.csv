776878,5,6304044658,"KITH is classic comedy.  They do have some clinkers, but all excellent comedians do.  If you have never seen them, buy Season One used, and go from there.  You will end up with them all.  I hope they release a DVD from their recent tour with new material.",1228003200,,255,4.25
776879,3,6304044658,"I love Kids in the Hall and had seasons 1-3 for a long time. I wanted to complete the series, so I bought the last two season. While watching the last two seasons, I noticed the show got boring. I didn't laugh as much in season four and I was very disappointed by it. Im happy to see that other reviewers fell the same way about it. Still a few laughs, but not as good as earlier seasons.",1190937600,4,388,3.9871794871794872
776880,5,6304044658,"Anyone who is a fan of ""The Kids"", an off-beat, hilarious Canadian comedy troop cannot pass on this set, especially since they don't play re-runs on Comedy Central anymore. They only have 5 seasons and they do not disappoint. If you are unfamiliar with The Kids in the Hall, they are produced by Lorne Michaels (Saturday Night Live) and are comprised of five members with very unique styles. Each member has appeared in tv and movies such as Friends, Newsradio and Sky High.

I describe them as a combination of Monty Python (with less British colloqialisms), SNL (but much better characters and more intelligent skits) and just plain bizaare and hilarious humor. They never miss an opportunity to dress as women and they play off of each other like family.

If ""The Chicken Lady"" who is always looking to get laid, ""Buddy Cole"" the outrageously [...] political commentator, ""Cabbage Head"" the misogynistic horn-dog or ""Simon and Hecubus"" the low-budget cable tv versions of Satan don't entice you, well then your funny bone may have been taken out accidently. peace",1153094400,5,1066,4.949720670391062
776881,5,6304044658,"KITH gets better with each season!  If you're a fan of this crazy Canadian quintet, take advantage of Amazon's low price not offered anywhere else and buy this set.  I'm looking forward to season 5 when it finally comes around to retail stores.",1151798400,2,244,4.651162790697675
776882,4,6304044658,"Most KITH fans agree that there seemed to be a swoon in Season 4 driven by a lack of creative spark. I would have to concur. While the troupe have rounded out their performances by this season, the material itself drops off. Still there are high points and I think the idea was that they were hoping to be more daring as shown but their lack of reliance on the old standby characters. Many of the recurring sketches are new, such as the socially edgy ""Steps"" featuring a group of gay men hanging out on the steps shooting the breeze.

The format is well-established by now: 4 discs; 3 of epsiodes; 1 of ""Best Of"", commentary, rare performances and everything else to which we've grown accustomed.

Personally I think it's worth owning. If you have the other 3 sets then why not just keep completing the collection?",1151712000,7,814,4.530612244897959
776883,3,6304044658,"There are a few classics in this DVD series, but they pretty much can be seen in the ""best of"" disc.  The remaining skits...eh...well...how does one say this...but it seemed like they were running out of steam in this season.  WAAAAY too many skits are forgettable or (ack) just overall not very funny.  & I could not bear to sit through an entire episode devoted to the Queen of England. Even 3 stars seems pretty generous.

I love Kids in the Hall, but unless you're a diehard fan, I would recommend skipping this season.",1150934400,8,523,4.531914893617022
776884,5,6304044658,"Two episodes from season 3 and two from season 4 do not add up to Season 4 (4 episodes).  I, too, also ordered season 3 so I will be getting duplicates. I should have read the reviews before I ordered.  Never again from this seller.

776886,5,6304044658,"I had never before seen the Kids in the Hall in action until I bought this tape.  Of course, I'd heard of them before, and I wanted to become more comically aware, so it made sense to buy the video.  When I was slapped in the face with Francesca Fiore selling her perfume, I was weirded out by it, but I grew to love it when I saw the Kids perform ""Do, a deer"" for a little boy who lost his puppy.  Random goodness.  However, when you get used to the idea that the Kids are this weird, you feel yourself grow with it.  I love it.",973641600,,529,3.9065420560747666

7861021,4,6304044658,"This was the first season that The Kids in the Hall made for CBS after leaving HBO. It strikes me as a very weird batch of shows, and not the typical brand of weird for the Kids. For one thing, it often feels like two different shows. About half of the episodes seem like exactly what you'd expect; quirky, off-the-wall characters and situations, risque sexual humor, and classic recurring bits. These episodes feel like a natural continuation from Season 3. But the other half have something missing. They're not as edgy and there seem to be a ton of business-room skits that don't really make fun of businessmen the way the first three seasons did. These skits give the impression that they were either written with a conscious effort to tone down the show, or they were written by CBS writers instead of the Kids themselves. Sometimes the mediocrity even infects classic characters, like the Simon and Hecubus skit where Hecubus shows multiple personalities that all have the same voice and rhyming names. It seems like a corny birthday party routine, not a skit by a seasoned comedy troupe. Another strange characteristic of this season is that there are far more characters than ever played by outside actors. A lot of bit roles and larger speaking parts are done by actors never seen on the show before, and I can only chalk that up to the move to CBS. Despite the problems with Season 4, there are still some of the best skits of the show's run hidden within. One is the origin of the Chicken Lady, showing the moment of her birth. Another is the glorious Sausages skit with Bruce McCullough and Scott Thompson. Anyone who doesn't understand, I want sausages!! I wah yah-yah-juhhhhh....!!! just isn't a Kids in the Hall fan. There's also the anal-probing aliens, Sex Boy Patrol, Scott's kind-hearted gesture to help a young straight guy in his goal to f. a celebrity, and the STEPS characters, who were way ahead of their time. As usual, the DVD set is very well done, with great picture and sound and plenty of extra features. Even though this is the only season of Kids that is less than 5 stars for me, it's still recommended for anyone into strange, random sketch comedy. And remember....always pour salt in your eyes.",1453593600,,2229,4.703324808184143
7861022,2,6304044658,Season 4 is where the Kids laugh ratio really drops. Sketches are too weird and not funny.,1450396800,,90,4.352941176470588
