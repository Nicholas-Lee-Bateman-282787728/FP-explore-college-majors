2201961,3,B00076QFXI,"""Sensations of 1945"" is largely built around the first prickly then inevitably tender relationship of characters played by Eleanor Powell and Dennis O'Keefe. The appearances of W.C. Fields, Sophie Tucker, Eugene Pailette and C. Aubrey Smith constituite the best recommendation for this movie. A classy scene is Fields as himself (?) paying tribute to Aubrey Smith in the role of a theater giant down on his financial luck. Forget the love story- it is the star turns plus the music of Cab Calloway and Woody Herman that make this film jump (to use Cab's hipster lingo)!",1369612800,,569,4.9375
2201962,5,B00076QFXI,"Eleanor Powell had left MGM for Astor Pictures when this all-star musical was released in 1944 (though 1945 is listed as part of the title).  There are many big names in this picture, including the big bands of Woody Herman and Cab Calloway, W.C. Fields (his last film), Dennis O'Keefe, C. Aubrey Smith, Sophie Tucker, Dorothy Donegan, and The Les Paul Trio, among others.  But Powell steals the show, as always, with her great dancing, especially a very clever number where she taps inside a giant pinball machine.  There is not much plot to this film, but the musical performances are excellent.

After this film, Powell, who had married actor Glenn Ford (they had a son, Peter), went into semi-retirement.  She did come back for one cameo in the 1950 picture&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duchess-of-Idaho/dp/B0062Z0PMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duchess of Idaho</a>, appeared on TV in 1952 on Danny Thomas' FOUR STAR REVUE, then was ordained a minister in the Unity Church and disappeared from public view for the most part.  After divorcing Ford in 1959 (it was an unhappy marriage, by all accounts),  Eleanor came out of retirement and did a nightclub act and all of the leading TV variety shows of the day, including THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE, and THE BELL TELEPHONE HOUR, and she was also one of Johnny Carson's first guests after he took over THE TONIGHT SHOW.  Some of her TV clips are on YouTube, but I'd love to see a DVD release of some of these shows.  Her last public appearance was at a televised 1981 American Film Institute tribute to Fred Astaire, her partner in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadway-Melody-of-1940/dp/B00008AOWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadway Melody of 1940</a>&nbsp;(one of the best tap routines ever).  I though she had passed away years earlier, but she died of cancer in February 1982, at age 69, still relatively young.

I'd also like to see PBS' AMERICAN MASTERS do a Powell retrospective so that younger people can be introduced to this wonderful lady, who, with all due respect to Ann Miller, was the best female tap dancer ever.

The young tapper Melinda Sullivan (of SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE fame) has already done an Ann Miller tribute on her Web site; I hope she eventually does a similar tribute to Eleanor.",1361059200,8,2373,5.298666666666667
2201963,4,B00076QFXI,"To save stocking fees (I guess) Amazon prints some of these (more obscure) DVDs after an order is placed.  This is great because it makes the DVD accessible.  However, the print quality is just acceptable and there are no special features included.  More importantly and frustrating about the print ""on demand"" DVDs is that they do not include a chapter menu where one can go directly to a specific scene if necessary.",1357516800,7,418,4.777777777777778
2201964,3,B00076QFXI,"Serious aficionados who watch Eleanor Powell movies want to see great dancing with the best legs God ever put on a lady dancer, good music,and at least a semi-credible plot. Ellie's Pin-ball dance is a classic, and the attending circus is eclecticly entertaining, and the finale sensational. (Ouch! with all those splits!) Alas, all the VHS  tapes being sold as new are really 3rd or 4th generation copies that look to be seriously out-of-focus.  All vendors get their copies from a single source.  I bought two copies at different times and the quality is uniformly poor. The delicious Ellie Powell does more yakkin' than hoofin'and in group shots, one cannot discern facial features. Good, clear VHS copies of this movie are proably nowhere available. This would be four stars is if the video was clear. Those great legs deserve better.",1115856000,15,838,4.9714285714285715

The plot is an excuse to present singing, dancing, and circus acts of the time. Historically, this film is interesting in that the viewer has a chance to see many of the popular stars and acts of the period. Low pointW. C. Fields totally unfunny skit.
