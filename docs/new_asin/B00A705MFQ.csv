5391415,4,B00A705MFQ,"much more complicated than a ""one night stand"" including incursions into the regular lifestyles of the participants, more on the order of a full day
runaround.  But the key emotional concept was that ""I want to remember you as you are now"" not to be confused with later discovered faults and
developing decrepitudes.  ""Girl"" went on to complete her seven year engagement by marrying her long time boyfriend in perpetual Hell.  ""Boy"" presumably found his way to his next risky entrepreneurial project.  Not as described in the detail blurb but a very pleasant movie.",1470614400,,565,4.9787234042553195

5391450,4,B00A705MFQ,"Interesting yet movie worth a date night at home. The sex scenes were so obscure that I could not determine real sex from dry humping but what do I know?

The dark mole on the female lead's nose is so darn prominent and irritating that I want to take a surgical scalpel and cut it off her nose from the screen. Some plastic surgery is in order here.

The male lead is completely believable.

The female lead's fiancee may be ultimately right but he comes off as a completely self-confident little douchebag s**t who needs an epic beat-down of biblical proportions!  The sex scenes, while frequent, are tastefully done.

She ultimately chickens out and does ""the right thing"" (playing it safe and dooms herself to a lifetime of unsatisfying, unfulfilling sex with the little s**t husband) instead of following her heart and true love (hint: It is not with the little s**t dude...)

5391553,1,B00A705MFQ,"It was really was a trashy Korean version of Bridges of Madison county in which the affair developed over four days and the only thing that kept the woman, Francesca, from leaving with the photographer was her family and she was already married.  Girl here, not married, BF a jerk, no reason to stay if fate crosses your path; what follows is 24 hours of crazy.

Boy meets girl in elevator; small talk then they are making out.  I am still trying to figure out if that was a fantasy,

It moves very slowly after that, there is a chance meeting the same day and with hours they are making whoopee on the floor at his office.  Girl is to be married in a month and boy has plans to go to Africa net day.  She agrees to stay with him until 6 as she is blown off by her BF/finance who doesn't have time to give her any of his time.  It has you thinking, "" here fate has crossed her path and she has the opportunity to find real love before marrying someone who no longer really cares.""

They walk in the park, go shopping, play at the arcade, have more sex (somewhere with a round tub, never really explain where they are) she blows off her meeting with her BF at 6 to stay with him. When BF picks her up in the evening, Boy follows them to PhoTai and she tells BF she's been with him.  She calls boy a moron, throws a drink in his face and BF leaves.  Boy and girl go to a club, BF follows, calls her then tells boy he is nothing to her.  In club girl whores herself up again to boy, calls BF whilst getting a good licking,  fights with boy and her rapes her.

Everybody runs away then meet up again in a park where they kiss and make up boy traces her hand on a park bench.  Boy and girl hold this self marriage ceremony in front of virgin Mary (?) they spent the night again in a pricey condo that belongs to boy supposedly but they have made several references to the fact he is broke.

Next morning they leave and are preparing to go their separate ways.  She has texted BF and asked for forgiveness.  She jumps in a taxi and leaves boy standing on the curb longing for her to come back. THEN they have a "" Bridges of Madison County"" Korean style moment.  The taxi stops at the red light, girl is looking back at boy, he is looking a the taxi...her hand reaches for the door handle, she holds it... will she run back to him?  Heck no. Lights changes to green and taxi drives away.

It was a 24 hour fling.  Later she is all in her pure white gown taking wedding photos and passes bench in the park.  Boy has added a tracing of his hand (complete with bracelet she'd given him) touching her hand.  The End",1400371200,2,2604,4.092702169625246

5391556,5,B00A705MFQ,This movie brought back some great memories of my youth. I guess that makes it a good movie for me. The storyline more so than the acting made this movie good. Some of the music lyrics was excellent. I love the boys comment to girl about never getting old. I think I said the same thing in 1975 in New York city. Been married twice.

This movie challenged the viewer's sense of morality by playing on the viewer's sense of compassion and the universal human desire to see, what would appear to be, true love or the perfect match triumph.

The end didn't go the way I wanted. I thought he could have ran after the taxi and her look into the rearview mirror, open the door, run after him and jump on him, then the movie could end. That way at least a good finality. With the way it ended now it is open for all kinds of unanswered questions.
I can see people falling for each other with hopeless circumstances like they have here. I have been in the unfortunate situation myself where your whole heart is on the line and you feel like a victim with no other course to take. I am on the level with this film and I recommend it if you like to see what an Asian romance would look like. Keep in mind they speak Korean but it is subtitled English, thankfully. I like when they speak their own tongue because it's more natural and not fake for the acting. Good acting by the way. The sex scenes I feel could have been better played out or acted with more spice, but overall I really felt like they had a connection, which is what I wanted. I really liked the guy and girl thing and her fiance was a money douchebag. Its sad to know that is how it really is, girls choose guys with money over their hearts now because society tells them they will be happy. When really they will only be sad, and sure they will be secure, but they will eventually raise the kids as best they can, and then get divorced eventually. ALWAYS follow your heart when it comes to relationships. Money does NOT = love!!",1387324800,2,1591,4.2026143790849675

It's not a new story but it's told in a different way from a Korean perspective.  I'm currently studying Korean and it had enough story to keep me interested and not overly complicated so I could keep up.  There was some intimacy and skin in it which it seems Asian women just have this knack for being beautiful on screen.  However, it wasn't porn by any means.  Over all I would recommend it but be sure you understand the culture or are wiling to learn a little about culture before watching it.",1365292800,6,649,4.330578512396694
5391664,4,B00A705MFQ,"This is definitely a NC-17 or R-rated movie, with nudity & sex scenes - but no full-frontal.
The recording definitely isn't steady at times (scene moves up+down) and there are several errors with the subtitles/translation, but I think that Korean-drama lovers who can accept the one-night-stand concept (even if you want romance instead of sex), would like this movie. However, those who have never seen (or don't like) Korean dramas would likely agree with other reviewers that it's slow, doesn't have enough ""spark,"" or perhaps that it's corny or awkward.

SYNOPSIS: ""Boy"" instantly likes ""Girl"" when they met, but she was engaged and thus rejected his offer of drinks.  She was attracted to him and his personality, though, so when he continued to pursue her and she found out he's only in the country for another day, she gave in.
Romance develops as they're spending the day together, finding out that they love each other's company. They still have her upcoming wedding and his upcoming departure, though, so how will they proceed...?
WARNING: There's a very short sex scene when Girl struggles against Boy, but it's more a fight between them instead of a forced scenario, but I'm mentioning it just in case.

This movie is similar to other Korean-dramas in that the characters develop very intense feelings for each other almost instantaneously.  Also typical is how the romance, aside from the sex scenes, is supposed to be sweet and subtle - not blatant or public. Because of this, some may consider the character+plot childish or dull. For example, him running to find the bandage for a minor cut, them playing pranks on each other, the hand-print, the ""wedding,"" her inability to ignore him in front of her fiance, and of course, him ordering warm water, are all actions that show how they're falling for each other.

I would actually give this movie 4.5 stars if possible, because for a short movie, the sweetness of their romance is actually very well-developed and realistic. For me, it was a great mixture of romance + ""spice.""",1364947200,23,2042,4.924418604651163
