2637073,4,B000HEWEX0,"I fell in love with Tinto Brass movies from my first viewing of Frivolous Lola.  It is the type of movie which is right up my alley.  These are not porn movies, however, they are very erotic and sexy.  Best of all the women in these films are not overly shaved, air-brushed, been under the knife too many times, plastic Barbi want-a-bes.  These are real women, with real curves, real hair (you know which hair I am talking about) and real personalities.  Best of all, most of Tinto Brass' female stars are Italian.  I usually watch these films in Italian with the subtitles on, just to hear the melody of the language.

Plot-wise, almost every one of his films are the same (except Salon Kitty,) hapless, jealous, and hopelessly sexually repressed boyfriend/husband; free-spirited, sexually adventurous girlfriend/wife (did I mention hot & usually Italian), conflict ensues, erotic adventure takes place, resolution and a happy ending.  What more could one want in life?

All Ladies Do It is the best of these three films, if you are ordering them one at a time.  The women in Volume I lean more towards the more mature and curvaceous, while the heroines in Volume 2 lean more toward the young and innocent.  All are pleasing to the eye.  Happy viewing.",1208822400,43,1253,4.776744186046511
2637074,5,B000HEWEX0,"If you do not like naked, voluptuous, natural women do not buy
this set. The story line is secondary although it does have more
of a place than some previous offerings. These are not porn films.
They are erotic to the nth degree. Visually stunning and surprisingly
well acted. A cross between Fellini and Gucionni (of Caligua and Penthouse)
fame. No fluff. No young, tiny breasted gigglers. Great looking adult
women in search of sexual happiness and completion. The men in these
films are the ones that are the weaker sex and have the most problems.
A great romp! Don't over critique. Just sit back and enjoy! Films made
by a man that loves women and tries to show a woman's view.",1208217600,31,681,4.590163934426229

Excellent films for T & A. (4 stars)

Terrible films for plot and acting.

Did I mention excellent for T & A?

8139500,4,B000HEWEX0,"I really don't think that I am the one to judge Tinto Brass ability as a director. He definitely has his own vision of love, sex, and romance, and perhaps can even be considered a master in the genre. Although, i don't always feel comfortable with true-to-life depiction of human sex organs, i have to admit that when that hits the screen, it has an almost revelational quality. It takes away the porn, and just shows it the way it is. As for the plot summary, i think All Women Do It topples the other two by its inventivness and sort of raw presentation.",1245888000,8,556,4.355769230769231
8139501,1,B000HEWEX0,"Wow, I kept hoping this movie would pick up, boooring. She just seemed like a cruel flirt to me. One who enjoyed stringing men along. I'm a woman and very much enjoyed Cheeky, great flick! Got it for a Valentine's gift for my sweetie. We had a wonderful time but this one, towards the end I fell asleep a couple times and still don't quite know why we sat thru the entire thing. I haven't watched the rest of the movies after this one, I didn't want to be disappointed and waste my time. I sure hope they are better!",1240272000,2,516,4.17
