When I found this available, I knew I had to have it.  Diana Vreeland is a big part of this, explaining La Belle Epoque in her inimitable way. it is a glimpse of what the turn of the century was like for the upper crust, the Beau mode. Included are interviews with people that experienced these years, like Erte.  The people from the MOMA in NYC made this ( it was a history exhibit);  they also produced another, which I recommend, available here.  It is the story of Marie Antoinette.  The same care was made, scenery, the gowns worn by the Queen.",1477958400,,705,4.2631578947368425
8107087,3,B00005U15Y,"While Diana Vreeland is the more entertaining of the commentators, worth watching for her segments alone the production quality is low. But some nice old, silent film footage of Paris.",1445126400,,184,5.166666666666667
8107088,4,B00005U15Y,The documentary clearly defines La Belle Epoque period.  It is a good beginning for someone interested in this beautiful artful period of time in Paris.,1429315200,,152,5.08

8107090,5,B00005U15Y,"The interviews with Diana Vreeland and the 7th Earl of Canaervon are priceless.  Even Barbara Cartland, Erte', and Latarque  make this as first person history.  The visuals are Art Nouveau at its best. This era before the war was for the rich and famous.  The other 99% are barely mentioned.  This is pure pleasure.",1395619200,,315,4.7592592592592595
8107091,4,B00005U15Y,"this was a nice compendium of energy from this fascinating time period in Western History... also good because its rare and older, interviews with knowledgeable old timers (tho they weren't actual participants in the era, they still bring some perspective)

the program covers great aspects of the arts and culture... Only setback for me is it spends too much time in the lordly , stuffy England, where Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley were burned at the stake... I'd've preferred more time in Paris and Vienna",1363046400,2,510,5.0
8107092,3,B00005U15Y,"This is an old-fashioned kind of documentary, probably shot in the 70s about the Belle Epoch.  It features narrators like Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who were probably really at their heyday in the 20s, but comment on the Belle Epoch as if they lived it.  So that's kind of weird.  Otherwise, it's a useful and entertaining, if slightly slow overview of Europe's beautiful age.",1362787200,2,373,4.888888888888889
