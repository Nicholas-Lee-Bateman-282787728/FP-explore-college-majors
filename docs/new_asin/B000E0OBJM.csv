2476852,5,B000E0OBJM,"Hands down this is indeed the BEST little mini-collection of Unsolved Mysteries to date. it sure beats buying all the different sets; UFO's, Psychics, Miracles.....because all of them are wrapped up into the BEST, and you don't have to watch the repetitive stuff :P

definitely a good buy if your looking to either save money or just fall in love with the best show that was on television.",1219881600,2,389,4.720588235294118
2476853,5,B000E0OBJM,"Personally i have not seen all of the episodes on this set.  If you are a lover of unsolved mysteries, I would recommend adding this one to your collection.",1205107200,,156,4.379310344827586
2476854,1,B000E0OBJM,"I recently bought this set at a good price. The dvd material is really weak. The ghost storys that are new should have been called ""the worst ghost storys"" because none of them are worth viewing. I remember the ones where they found a man in a cave trapped under a boulder, a kid who came home to a house full of ghosts, and one where people where going thru pictures and had a picture of a ghost in them. I don't know what these were called but they were probably three of the best segements of the show. They should release anther ghost and bizarre murders set because there is alot more ground to cover. Very disappointed with the set.",1189123200,3,638,4.2809917355371905
2476855,4,B000E0OBJM,"Overall it's pretty good and has a broad range of topics from murders, ufo's, and ghosts.",1184457600,,89,4.625
2476856,5,B000E0OBJM,"Ok...I purchased this set knowing what I would get.  Meaning I knew it had a lot of repeats and knowing there were mistakes in the set but I got it anyway...why you ask...Cuz I am a true lover of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and wanted every story that is available on DVD.  I'm happy with this set because there are a couple new stories that I had never seen when the show was on the air.  If you are a person who owns the ""Ultimate Collection"" keep in mind that there are only 4 new stories...the rest of the new stories are on the ""Treasures and Ghosts"" DVD you got with the Ultimate Collection.  I'll end with saying that we are very lucky to have gotten a chance to get this wonderful show on DVd and I hope there will be more tom come one day!",1173916800,5,741,4.125
2476857,5,B000E0OBJM,"I normally avoid ""best of"" sets, I'll decide what's the best of a given show, thank you very much. But I got this for the new content and because I'm not interested in the Miracles or Murders sets, but still would appreciate some of those stories. This set was great, 33 stories, 14 of them new, so I don't understand the reviewer who says it was lacking in new content. Also, I never saw the word ""curse"" misspelled as ""cures.""

5 Treasures segments, 9 Ghosts, 3 UFO's, 5 Murders, 4 Miracles, 2 Legends, 2 Psychic, and 3 that can't be categorized by existing box set, 2 being ""Lost Loves"" type, and one being ""Sci-Med."" Complaints: Disc 3 says it has ""Terrorized Teen,""  but instead has ""Voice From the Grave,"" ""Marcos' Buddha"" says it has an update but doesn't, ""Mummy's Curse"" was more of a ""Legend"" type of story than ""Ghost"" story.

There were some treasures segments not included on here, also left out were the Chupacabras story and The Gurdon Lights. Most of the dvd's of UM are centered around ""The Unexplained"" segments. I hope they release more dvd sets in the future, but this one, despite its flaws, is still very good.",1148601600,25,1132,4.566502463054187
2476858,4,B000E0OBJM,"Here are the episodes included on ""The Best of Unsolved Mysteries"" for those who own previous Unsolved Mysteries.

I hope this is helpful.",1146182400,215,684,5.91919191919192
2476859,2,B000E0OBJM,"First, let me explain that I am an enormous fan of the show.  When they first released box sets I was excited, and currently own four of them.

Imagine my excitement seeing this ""new"" box set on a store shelf last week.  I bought it no questions asked and returned home with a friend to check it out.

After doing so, for two reasons I am really disappointed.  First, like previously mentioned, the lack of new content.  I hope this doesn't mean they have given up on the box sets by lumping skits from each set into one set.  It is near impossible to find any of the box sets in stores besides Bizarre Murders, and now this one shows up all over the place with no restocking of the other sets.

My second complaint is with the sloppy work done with the set itself.  For one, a segment that is advertised on the box titled ""Terrorized Teen"" on disc 3 does not even appear!  Instead, they put in its place a segment from the Bizarre Murders set with Teresita Basa.  We were incredibly disappointed with that as the Teen segment sounded great.  Also, the DVD menu for the bonus disc contains a typo for the segment ""Mummy's Curse"" spelling it ""Mummy's Cures.""  A petty complaint, or a sign that FirstLook really didn't put top notch effort in this release?

I pray they are working on new sets with unreleased segments.  There are few other shows more deserving of better or improved DVD treatment than Unsolved Mysteries.",1143504000,48,1420,4.470817120622568
2476860,3,B000E0OBJM,"Having been a loyal fan of ""Unsolved Mysteries"", I was pleasantly suprised when First Look Media released the various DVD boxed sets (""Ghosts"", ""UFOs"", ""Bizarre Murders"", ""Miracles"", ""Psychics"" and ""Strange Legends"")awhile back. While the respective sets were far from perfect in their content, they nevertheless were able to whet my appetite for the time being as I anxiously awaited more volumes. So imagine my suprise when I discovered that First Look media would be releasing a ""Best Of Unsolved Mysteries"" DVD collection. It seemed to be a great excuse to cull segments from the many seasons' worth of UM episodes. Perhaps some of the more (in)famous segments would finally be brought to digital life. Suffice it to say, that is simply not the case here. Sure, you get an extra bonus DVD featuring five ""ghost"" segments and five ""treasure"" segments as well as a less-than-generous sprinkling of new segments throughout the rest of the collection. However, the vast bulk of the collection is composed of segments found in the various aforementioned boxed sets. While this may appeal to newer fans and/or those who did not want to buy the categorized sets, it is a major letdown to fans who already own them. Barring any legal or copyright issues, one has to wonder why First Look didn't mine the rich UM archive for more segments. While the new segments included in this collection are fascinating, it nevertheless leaves fans of the UM DVDs wanting more---a whole lot more.

With near-perfect picture and sound quality, this set makes for a great gift for casual fans. However, loyal fans may want to hedge their bets before deciding to shell out money for this collection.",1143072000,88,1678,4.97153024911032
2476861,5,B000E0OBJM,"I LOVE ""Unsloved Mysteries""! I'm very excited that they are releasing more DVDs of this show,and hopefully they will release more DVDs later on. The Best of is on 4 Discs,and runs 6hrs,& 49mins. It has some stories that has never been released on dvd yet. If you are an Unsloved Mysteries Fan I suggest you buy this DVD-set!

2476873,5,B000E0OBJM,"Ha!  To see this listed right now on DVD for $111 is unreal.  I found my copy at Ollie's for $5.  I am very happy to get the new episodes on this collection, but am very disappointed that consumers can get every episode of Family Matters, Full House, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, as well as WWE smackdown, Keeping up with the Kardashians, The Bachelor, 16 and Pregnant, Hardcore Pawn, Dancing with the Stars, and every other awful and unwatchable worthless garbage on DVD, but an American Classic like Unsolved Mysteries goes into the vaults forever, never to see the light of day again.  Ridiculous.  This show was everyone's favorite when it ran for so long that many of the guilty who were captured as a result of it also admitted to it being their favorite show.  RELEASE THE WHOLE SERIES ALREADY.  ITS BEEN LIKE 25 YEARS!  LETS GO!!",1460332800,12,833,4.543624161073826

2476937,1,B000E0OBJM,"With the spooky piano music forever playing in the background and the over the top special effects constantly trying to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, Unsolved Mysteries does a bang up job of making you, the viewer, want to believe in every paranormal activity out there such as ghosts, the after-life, the ability to contact your recently deceased aunt.  However, in many of these episodes, it is simply a case of flash over substance or an appeal to our worst and deepest fears.  You know those thoughts you have in the middle of the night when you wake up, have to take a leak and the house is cold?  Welcome to Unsolved Mysteries. They may sprinkle in the occasional buried treasure story but their bread and butter is showcasing the worst of the paranormal along with real life monsters.  Robert Stack and Co. are true believers or at least are paid to convince you that what they're selling is gospel.  And they don't seem to second guess much or take a skeptics approach.  Often the stories are filled with cold, hard, fact and the testimonies from witnesses are credible but that doesn't mean they're right.  I advise anyone watching and buying into these programs to step back, look out the window on a sunny afternoon and examine your own life experiences.  Do they mesh with what Robert Stack and Unsolved Mysteries are selling?  Don't get suck in.",1415318400,,1378,4.637860082304527

I think the previous reviews were harsher because the people who purchased it were hard-core fans who already purchased the other boxed-sets. If you are a first-time buyer just looking for a nice compilation, then this is the set for you. Also, the bonus biography on Robert Stack is excellent. Enjoy!",1328486400,,343,4.830508474576271

And we could not forget, the schule time, when we sit down and enjoyed the mysteries, of our time. One thing, I believe it had a different music theme for the back sound. Maybe I am wrong. ??

The dramatic recreations of the stories are always quite good.........and if you look carefully, you can often find a few actors in these recreations who later went on to become very famous. For example, in this ""Best of Unsolved Mysteries"" collection, don't miss Matthew McConaughey in the ""Texas Most Wanted"" episode on disk #3. He plays a murder victim in Texas whose killer escaped and was only found 20 years later.",1229904000,13,606,4.950980392156863

8103450,5,B000E0OBJM,"The episodes are awesome, let me get that out the way, buuut... Why sooooooo MUCH??? I purchased this IDENTICLE collection, same DVD's, same box, same 33 episodes, ect, just a few years back (under me and my ex-wifes account) here on Amazon for around $20!!! I purchased it for myself at the time, but ended up giving it to my mother as a Xmas present (as this show was always her fav when i was growing up), as i couldn't think of anything else to get her. She let me barrow it since and yes i do remember loving this collection, although this collection is missing some memorable episodes i remember watching while growing up.

  IMO your better off just getting a PRIME membership as they GIVE YOU seasons 1,2 and 3 to watch FOR FREE on Amazon Prime Video. Each season has between 18-25 Episodes, which i have been enjoying probably even more-so then i remember enjoying this over-priced collection! With Prime your getting over 60 Episodes for FREE, compared to this collection of 33 Episodes for over $150???!!!!  Yea, you do the math!

  I came here looking for all the seasons after season 3, as i been on an Unsolved Mysteries kick since Amazon added the first 3 seasons to Prime, seems all are unavailable! UGH!!! :(

Gotta keep looking!

RIP ROBERT STACK!!! YOUR VOICE IS CREEPILLY AMAZING!!! lol

Hope this HELPED!!! :)",1490832000,,1330,4.621276595744681

The eerie settings and the music and atmosphere was quite simply amazing. The quality is also looking like it was remastered as well.. I have been having a lot of nostalgia moments.
