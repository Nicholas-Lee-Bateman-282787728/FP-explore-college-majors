1623152,5,B00005LQ2A,Carlin at his best. This dvd is very funny.  It was sad to watch Carlin go from a funny stand-up to a grouchy old man.,1345507200,,118,3.72
1623153,4,B00005LQ2A,"Another HBO special.

One of my favorite bits is picky eater, partly since I was one as a child, too. George tells us things we never thought about concerning dogs and cats. And he's expanded his list of seven dirty words by quite a lot: the closing credits roll while he's reading a long scroll of all the ones he could think of.",1336694400,,330,4.238095238095238
1623154,5,B00005LQ2A,"I have just about everything by Carlin. There will never be anyone like him. I wish he could have lived longer; I miss him.
If you are a fan, you will love this one... but then, I love everything he has ever done, and who wouldn't! He is a comedic genius. His philosophy saves me everyday.",1282003200,3,289,4.178571428571429

1623156,5,B00005LQ2A,"Had a rough morning. Got into an argument with my Rice Krispies. I distinctly heard Snap, Crackle, **** Him !!!  I don't know which one of them said it.  I was looking for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl. I said well you all can just sit right there in the milk, far as I'm concerned. Youse can sit in the milk until I find out which one of you said that.  Awesome George.!!!!!!",1225843200,,414,4.215189873417722
1623157,5,B00005LQ2A,"I watched George Carlin perform this material way back in the early 80's. It was outrageously funny back then and still, to this day, is very much worth watching. George Carlin is truly at his best on this one. Especially with the long list of Dirty Words at the end of the show. Extremely funny, but not for the timid viewer.",1220054400,4,326,4.360655737704918
1623158,3,B00005LQ2A,George Carlin was a true pioneer for stand up comics.  This product reminded me why I still enjoy his work.,1217721600,,107,4.35
1623159,5,B00005LQ2A,"I pulled out my George Carlin DVD collection after the sad news of his untimely death. George Carlin has so many good stand-ups available on DVD that it is hard to decide which one is the best! This is certainly one of them! To truly appreciate Mr. Carlin's brand of humor you need first to have an open mind. Then you need to have a brain!

R.I.P. George
You will be missed!",1214870400,8,375,4.208333333333333
1623160,5,B00005LQ2A,"This was an AWESOME DVD and in GREAT shape! George Carlin is funny and this is by far one of his best! I would suggest this to anyone who is looking to laugh.

I will warn you this isn't for children to watch.",1174521600,6,209,3.86046511627907
1623161,4,B00005LQ2A,"George Carlin is a funny little (bleep), but not for little (bleep) kids, you know?  Because George Carlin isn't for kids.  His most famous routine is updated as he adds more words you can't say on TV.  Very funny man!",1020211200,4,218,4.4
1623166,5,B00005LQ2A,"First, let me be very clear that I am biased - I love George Carlin. I think he is a comedic genious, through and through. His style of comedy still holds up today, and this video represents his legacy as a comedian extremely well.",1426377600,,231,4.2727272727272725
1623167,5,B00005LQ2A,DVD Shipped and arrived very fast. Exactly as described. Thank you,1419811200,,66,5.090909090909091

1623169,2,B00005LQ2A,This is not Carlin at his best.  I didn't laugh once in the first 30 minutes and turned it off.,1416182400,,95,3.75
1623170,5,B00005LQ2A,i love george carlin if he was still alive i would go and see him thats how much i like him he is funny,1405814400,,103,3.3333333333333335
1623171,5,B00005LQ2A,I don't think Carlin has ever been funnier. He is really on top of his game in this concert.  Carlin can always be counted on to get us thinking about some interesting things as we laugh at ourselves.,1396483200,4,200,4.2631578947368425
1623172,2,B00005LQ2A,"It's still interesting to hear George Carlin's comedic musings, although this stand up effort was more venting than comedic venting.",1394582400,,132,5.65
1623173,5,B00005LQ2A,"Carlin at Carnegie was my first true exposure to stand-up comedy decades ago. This single performance still rates as my all-time favorite. Carlin is a master of verbiage. Where Pryor, Hackett & Murphy are master storytellers, Carlin, like Wright & Foxx, is best at presenting ideas with humor & a personal flair. Carlin is in his comedy prime, having done away with most of the skits of the earlier years & without the acidity of his delivery in the later years. If you are a fan, then this is 1 of 2 of his works that you should own. The other being ""Complaints & Grievances"". He's angry on ""You are all Diseased"" which is also good. In all, it still makes me laugh and that's the most important part.",1392940800,4,702,4.449612403100775
1623174,5,B00005LQ2A,"George Carlin was awesome, and his brilliant characterizations deserve no better than headlining the Comics Hall of Fame; if ever there will be one!?!  He took the most mundane of scenarios and people, and had you cracking up with his dialogue and character development.",1366243200,,270,5.136363636363637
1623175,5,B00005LQ2A,"Remember watching this on cable when it first came out.  When I found out it was available on video, I HAD to get it  George's full wit had not been yet realized by this show, but it does foretell his later rapier wit and caustic commentary.",1359590400,3,241,4.217391304347826

The master of comedy!! This one has the  'list"".",1497571200,,87,4.375
7944305,1,B00005LQ2A,"Disgusting, HBO should be put on trial for murder.  They butchered this classic to death.  I am appalled.  Guess there's a lot of things George said that HBO disagrees with, so now Carlin's fans has to suffer.  HBO should cease and desist their PC bull and apologize for this disgrace.",1493337600,4,285,4.64
