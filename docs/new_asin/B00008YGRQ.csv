1868186,5,B00008YGRQ,"If anyone from Fox is listening, PLEASE release all three seasons on DVD.  Fans have been waiting sooooo long.  I think you will be surprised at the response.  The show is terrific and is suitable for all ages.  It's my absolute favorite of the great 60's TV shows.",1058400000,6,265,4.458333333333333
1868187,5,B00008YGRQ,"The Robinson family, Professor Robinson, Dr Smith, Alpha-Centauri, Will Robinson... Who does not remember these names - perhaps someone who did not live in the 60's decade. For those I say: you should know the ""Lost In Space"" adventure. Once you do that - you'll love the plot and the characters. The cast is superb, the photography is wonderful - the outer space, stars and planets, not to mention the amazing spaceship Jupiter 2. Jonathan Harris, as the Doctor Smith (""Never fear - Smith is here"", ""Oh, what a pain!"") is superb in his performances and makes the show very very fun with his tricks and eccentricities. It's a pity that Jonathan Harris has passed away on November 05, 2002. I miss him. Since 1965 (when I was only 4 years old) I use to watch this amazing series. I am from Brazil and I am quite sure that many brazilians wait for this release also. In truth I believe that all the world waits for this release (the three seasons). Now for you, the Producers and the Fox Studios: It is worth to release all the three seasons in DVD. Please do it. Let the next generations know how was the television in the 60's decade. I was only 4 years old and I loved it!... Irwin Allen was a genious in all his creations, specially ""Lost In Space"".",1057968000,6,1251,4.443478260869565
1868188,5,B00008YGRQ,"Dear friends, you all have to know that in Argentina is well know this serial (in the 60's) and we all miss it (who have about 40 or more). For the Producer - Studio: one important thing we might not reach is to get that in spanish (not from Spain but Central America), that's the way we knew it. But at least please consider to lunch it with subtitles, as well as any other.",1056412800,6,375,4.081081081081081
1868189,5,B00008YGRQ,"To be brief, the Ch video tapes made money, DVD's will make a ton more if the people in power were smart. Many fans bought other Lost in Space items in two's and three's. The DVD's will be one of the most welcome additions to any fan's wish list.",1055462400,4,246,4.040816326530612
1868190,5,B00008YGRQ,"For over 30 years true fans of Lost In Space have been awaiting this most incredible treasure of science fiction imagination. This plus the fact of an incredible spaceship, and enduring family, and the excellent cybernetic companion...the B-9 robot. The release of this magnificent sci-fi series on video will stand out as a tribute to the actors of Lost In Space. Great comedy thanks to Johnathan Harris and great drama and display of courage thanks to Guy Williams, Mark Goddard and Billy Mumy, and of course a big thank you to Irwin Allen. This show was great in shaping the minds of future fathers and engineers. It also stands out as a great look at how family values and attitudes were back then as compared to now. The Jupiter 2, the most ingenious spaceship design imagined broke the traditional mold of cigar shaped rockets! Great design with use of existing technology of the 1960's but it also gave future technical insight as to how spaceships should be designed...or looked upon as feasibility studies for anti-gravity drives, ion drives and plasma drives. This show gave us great sound and visual effects. Who could forget the Deep resonating hum of the ISD drive in the 1st two episodes "" The Reluctant Stowaway"" and ""The Derelict""? Great stuff!!![!]",1054771200,4,1265,4.888372093023256
1868191,5,B00008YGRQ,"I don't even have to SEE these to give them 5 stars. Lost in Space is a classic, and we need to have all 3 seasons released on DVD, not just the 1st one!  I mean really, if the Jeffersons and Space:1999 can get boxed season sets, then a series with such a large and passionate fan base like Lost in Space should have no problem getting all 3 seasons released. Right Fox??  C'mon, release them all and cash in on it, the episodes aren't making you any money sittin' in the vaults!",1054684800,11,479,4.139784946236559
1868192,5,B00008YGRQ,"The temptation for me to buy the video tapes was great...but I held out in hope that someday a complete package like this would be released. At last, my hopes are being answered! If you have any fond memories of this series, the robot, Dr. Smith and the entire Robinson family, you've got to order this set NOW! Only if the first season sells well will they ever issue the second and third seasons....which were definitely for those with more eclectic tastes!

1868194,5,B00008YGRQ,"I echo what has been said by the previous two reviewers, word for word.  Uncut digital quality episodes of Lost in Space at a more than good price are a welcome treat.
The first season is far and away for me the best of the three.  The creative ideas and wonderful adventure written into these episodes, as well as values and morals woven into them is a breath of fresh air, especially by today's standards.
I'll always be grateful to the writers, producers, actors, and others on the show for their contribution.  Despite the fact that not all epsisodes may be rated as first class science fiction, many of the episodes in all seasons, I believe, rate among the best of science fiction.",1050537600,14,687,4.569105691056911
1868195,5,B00008YGRQ,"OK, so its too early to actually do a rating and review on this. However I, for one, am excited that Lost in Space is finally being released on DVD and in such an affordable way.
I started buying the tapes years ago and quit just because it was too expensive. To be able to get all three seasons for the price of ten tapes is more than great.
Many of us have very fond memories of Lost in Space, and despite the general derision some people show toward the series, it will always hold a special place in our hearts.
It will just be nice to have complete, uncut episodes to see again.",1048896000,18,583,4.12280701754386

1868237,5,B00008YGRQ,"This series [TV-Series 1965-1968] is formulated on the old serial cliff-hangers. The stages are cardboard and Styrofoam. The props look like anything lying around in the ware house. From the dialog you would not realize that the actors can and are acting. As the programs progress the stories get weirder to holds your attention. There are also several notable guests including Robbie the Robot that always outsmarts ""The Robot"" (Bob May) The Robot's voice is Dick Tufeld.

We all know the basic story of a saboteur Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) is too smart for his own good and his sabotage backfires from the start throwing the spaceship into who knows where with him trapped inside. What is worse is he never learns from episode to episode. Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams) is the good guy father that is always giving one hope of being found or getting back. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) is the stereotypical motherly type and is caught occasionally stopping John from beating Zackary's brains out. We have mischievous kids always wandering off to discover the new trouble. And a watered down love interest between daughter Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major Don West (Mark Goddard).

How will they survive?
What strange creature or disaster will befall them this week?

1868240,5,B00008YGRQ,The first season of Lost in Space was in black and white and was totally serious like science fiction of the 1950s was has a show entered its second season it went into color and got a little silly and the third season was just as silly as the second season. I know the show was trying to compete with Batman but it over did it. The first season is the only season that I own even though I have watched the second and third season on TV but the first season is the best season for serious science fiction fans.,1501977600,,510,4.0594059405940595

1868242,3,B00008YGRQ,"Let me say this, I never remember seeing the first season of ...Lost in Space and let me say this....the character of Dr. Smith evolved from being a saboteur and programming the robot to kill the Robinsons. Then he became rather a buffoonish character. My biggest problem with this show was the fact that Will and Penny were always doing things that they weren't supposed to and getting everyone else into trouble.

I remember one time our TV wasn't working and I was able to listen to Lost In Space on the radio (CBS can be heard on radio as well as watched on TV).  It was 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon and the episode playing that day was ""Wish Upon A Star"" (one of my favorites from Season One).  It was a re-run, and I was thrilled to be able to listen to it on the radio since I couldn't watch it on TV that day!  It was the next best thing to being able to watch it, and I was such a fan of the show that it would've been devastating to miss it.  In fact, a lot of Saturdays it was listed as coming on but was pre-empted by sports programs.  Those were sorrowful Saturdays.

I also liked ""The Oasis,"" though one may wonder how Dr. Smith's clothes grow right along with him when he eats the alien fruit!

""There Were Giants in the Earth"" had some tender scenes between Will and his father, and I still love the musical score that accompanies those tender scenes throughout the show.

""Return From Outer Space"" was a favorite with Will returning to Earth alone.  Of course, this was the 1990's in the show, but Hatfield Four Corners was waaaay behind the times with the old-timey telephones.

""The Lost Civilization"" sees Will Robinson almost forced into a shotgun wedding.  He did the right thing choosing fun over marriage.  He and the girl were both way too young.

The first episode, of course, was the most exciting as the Robinson family blasts off into outer space, and Dr. Smith gets trapped aboard after programming the Robot to destroy the ship.  Ironically, we learn in Season Three's ""Time Merchant"" that Smith's added weight actually saved the family from being destroyed by an uncharted asteroid.

Fans of this show will enjoy watching the adventures all over again from beginning to end.",1451952000,,1989,4.420329670329671

1868695,4,B00008YGRQ,"I grew up with Lost In Space but it was never the one show that I always looked forward to.  As with many I'm most familiar with the diabolical Dr. Smith and the Robot's calling ""Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!""  So as my wife and I worked our way through this thick as thieves Season 1 collection it was fairly fresh for us and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

If you are a person who can still stand watching B&W TV or movies (I know that some, unfortunately, won't) you can find the serialized LIS as a bit of a time capsule.  Ahead of its time in the 1960s its look to the future and space travel is especially fun now.  The series really started off seriously minded, taking the notion of space exploration and future settlement of other planets in our solar system.  This surprised us given what we mainly remembered from the show, and it further surprised us to watch the Robinson family take about four episodes before crash landing on a planet only to remain on this extremely hostile planet for the rest of the season!  Lastly, it was a surprise to see the treacherous Dr. Smith take quite a while to develop his yellow streak and the Robot, who develops a funny antagonistic persona toward Smith by season's end, hardly ever belt out his electronic catchphrase.

The series, always ending on a cliffhanger, started to wear a little thin with their formula by season's end with Smith always putting his earthen family at risk over his own instincts and base desires.  Why in the world they never allowed Captain John Robinson or pilot Major Don West to deck the dude or lock him in the brig (which surely they could have made) is beyond me, other than the writer's using Smith as the cuckoo catalyst for most of the family's woes.  But it reminded me of Gilligan from the ""Gilligan's Island"" television series.  Watching it when I was young his goof antics that always screwed up the castaways' hopes of getting rescued never bothered me but as an adult...it bothered me.  And the same principle goes along here, but the unwillingness of the Robinson clad to resort to base violence is part of the charm of this series that is family friendly and refreshing.  I know that it was a product of the late 1960s but I was shocked when the family prayed to God (several times throughout the series) and firmly drew their morals from a divine notion.  It was refreshing to see!  I can't remember the last time I saw anything like that recently on TV.

Perhaps it would be worth it to get lost in space again if we could ""progress back to the future.""",1409443200,8,2546,4.502173913043478

1868726,4,B00008YGRQ,"Lost in Space,the first Season,is now out on DVD which contains all of the original 29 eps of that season,plus the pilot and a promo for the show. Approximately the first five eps of this season incorporate the pilot ep into its plot. The main difference between the pilot and the first five eps is Doctor Smith. He is not seen in the pilot (nor is the Robot),but in the season eps themselves. I suppose Fox wanted someone the Robinson family could""play"" off of. They found the perfect villain in Doctor Smith,played beautifully by Jonathan Harris. His character is a sneaky,low down,egotistic,conniving coward who is always looking out for himself first and foremost. Harris just chews up the scenery each and every time he is on. An absolute delight to watch.
If you have never seen the show it is about a family that takes off from earth on their way to Alpha Centauri. They never make it there as their ship gets into trouble and they're forced to crash land on an unknown planet. The show highlights their trials and tribulations,as they eke out a living and have to deal with creatures the planet harbours or from visitors from afar. The first season really emphasizes the family bond, but as the season progresses Harris' character blossoms and an ep without him simply isn't the same.
The show was a precursor to Star Trek and in fact we see many of the things Star Trek would later bring to the table here first,such as a discipline collar/ring on the neck,a Horta like creature and the Robot even brings up the Prime Directive! In fact the first ep of the second season talks about the essence of the life force that is everywhere in the universe and that binds us all together,beating Star Wars by quite a few years!
There are many stars that appear in the first season that you will recognize such as Mercedes McCambridge,a young Kurt Russell and Warren Oates. The name of the family was of course the Robinsons,an obvious reference to the Swiss Family Robinson who also became a stranded family. One will notice that the show,even in the first season,starts to reuse footage from one ep to another. One in particular is a scene in an early ep that shows the Chariot being bombarded during a meteorite storm. Later in the season the same scene is played out once more but now it is a volcanic eruption that has the chariot in its grasp. And savvy viewers will notice in a later ep that part of the Seaview set from Voyage from the Bottom of the Sea was used to flesh out the story(also filmed on the same lot).
The show remains in the minds of the original viewers not only due to Dr. Smith and his outbursts towards the Robot like""You bumble headed booby"",or ""Never fear,Smith is here"" or""The pain,the pain"",but also the Robot's own outbursts like""Danger,danger"".As the season wore on the Robot also got more cheeky with the doctor,even to the extent of laughing and making fun of him.
The wonderful catchy theme song was written by none other than John(Johnny in the titles)Williams. And speaking of music,those in the know will recognize the background music used quite frequently in these eps, from the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still. This was after all 20th Century Fox and this production had full access to its vast musical library.
No,it was quite the show then,and it still has that certain something to this day. There hasn't been an ep I cannot recall seeing when originally aired in /65-/66. The show has been remastered quite well but does have some slight defects/graininess due to its age,but nothing major. The first season is in b&w until the last cliffhanger of the last ep,when it turns to colour and on into the second and third season. Oh yes those cliffhangers. Each ep ends with a heart stopping moment which freezes and invites the viewer to be there same time,same station next week to see how it turns out. You may wonder why even the last ep of this season carries that same type of ending(same time,next week,etc), as one wouldn't theoretically see how it turns out until a few months later  in the fall. Well back in those days the networks would rerun their most popular shows throughout the summer. They would time the very last ep to coincide with the start of the NEW season in the fall! That way if you happened to miss the last ep during the regular season showing,you'd be able to catch it then. The old season leading naturally into the new one! Smart.
I highly recommend Lost in Space to everyone. It is a show the whole family can watch together. That's something terribly lacking in today's TV wasteland.",1402876800,8,4561,4.630864197530864

1868840,3,B00008YGRQ,"I remember loving the show as a kid and never missing these early episodes. The black and white era was one of shaky special effects, method acting, and weird storylines in the science fiction genre. Irwin Allen is a legend of this type of television and the cliffhangers were always worth coming back to, though were often resolved with outlandish solutions. The great thing about having the DVD box is not having to wait to see how they get out of all the messes week after week. The characters are the best thing about this and they are lovable, none more than Robot and Dr Smith. Both have become iconic to science fiction by themselves and have many quotable dialogue excerpts such as Robot's ""Danger Danger Will Robinson!"" or ""Warning! Warning!"". Dr Smith of course was the slimy mongrel villain who always gave false hope with his ""Never fear Smith is here!"" mantra. The girls in the show were nicely played and often the girls were just objects to be rescued when the monster of the week attacked.

The early episodes are memorable such as the one with the giant cyclops, the one with the water splashing over the jeeps, and of course the pilot where Smith sabotages the Robot and the ship. I can recommend this for nostalgia buffs though newcomers to the show may find the episodes a tad dull as they tend to drag on a bit, much like Land of the Giants. The colour episodes that come later may have more appeal and they were quirky episodes well worth seeing such as the one with the Carrot monster. In any case Season One is essential to sci fi TV and America's answer to Doctor Who was a real hit at the time of airing.",1373846400,6,1630,4.469798657718121

If it was Allen's decision or the Exec's  to turn Smith from a villian to a scaredy cat /comedian it was pure genius that made the show.  It allowed Harris to shine in this role.

1868893,5,B00008YGRQ,"Yes, it's a silly space show, but very endearing. I am appreciating it more now as I grow older. I guess this show is especially for those of us who were alive when television went from Black & White to color. Once this show went to color it seems they were not as concerned with the plots as they were with having colorful episodes. I always hated Dr Smith, but now...well...he was a 'colorful' character and a role model for what we all should never EVER be. Amazing how Will always fell for Dr Smith's tricks. You would think he would eventually have learned better.

Then there was the John Robinson vs Dr Smith element. In contrast to Will, John Robinson always seemed to see through Dr Smith. He was impossible to trick for very long. Whenever Dr Smith tried to pull his tricks on John Robinson he would do so with his proverbial tail between he legs. Oh, Dr Smith was least bold in his lies when he was trying to trick John Robinson (a fantastic role model of what a father should be)

Like I said, now in retrospect, the show was silly, but is now endearing

Once it went to color it kind of turned into some sort of Wizard of Oz in Space television program.

Smith and robot made a great comedy team. I remember a scene where the robot states

""One cowardly man and one brave robot!""

1868908,5,B00008YGRQ,"This is a wonderful series that, in the first season at least, sought to interject science into ""science fiction"" more than most would suspect. It isn't ""campy"" so much as it is simply dated in terms of special effects and we tend to compare productions like ""Lost In Space"" with the ""Star Wars"" level and sophistication.

The series is a 1960's space version of the ""Swiss Family Robinson"" that seeks to colonize another world but finds itself off course and unable to return to Earth. This was an era in which overpopulation was seriously considered as a future certainty and the Robinsons were volunteers to leave Earth to make a life elsewhere. The series tackled some interesting hypotheticals such as a planet with a radically elliptical orbit that alternated between extreme cold and extreme heat. It looked at life evolving very differently on another planet than on Earth as well as encountering intelligent life very different from ourselves. It includes concepts such as hydroponic gardening (something considered the ""next wave"" by some serious scientists of the day) as well as robotic tools.

The cast is actually quite good with Guy Williams as Professor John Robinson and veteran actress June Lockhart as wife Maureen. Jonathan Harris plays the scheming Dr. Smith while Mark Goddard does a credible job as Major Don West, the Jupiter II's tough guy pilot. The children's roles are reasonably well cast. If one notices, the music was composed by ""Johnny Williams"" - the same John Williams who later composed music for the Star Wars films, Jaws and many others.

This was really a ground-breaking series in its day and, although subsequent seasons were indeed ""campy"" and more oriented toward humor and away from science and adventure, this first season was very much in keeping with the times of the space race to the Moon. There's a wonderful sense of innocence and great adventure in this first season that I fondly remember from my childhood. I very much recommend this to audiences young and old with five stars.",1339804800,5,2031,4.9676470588235295
1868909,2,B00008YGRQ,"A computer store had a 1:1 scale B-9 robot, the one you can purchase for about $24K, and had Lost in Space playing on a large screen TV.  I was 15 in 65' and ""coming of age"" and was oblivious to LIS.  I became motivated to see what I had missed and purchased the highly recommended first season.  Unbeknownst to me, it was shot in black and white, unlike whatever season was playing at the computer store.  I respect the fact LIS was geared for a younger audience and my review is not intended to disrespect the folks that have fond memories of the series.  I can relate with the enjoyment memorable TV shows can bring, I came up empty on this one.  The B&W format works in Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Night of the Living Dead, but not LIS, apparently the remaing seasons are done in color.  Early on, you witness Jonathan Harris, Mummy, and the B-9 steal the show episode by episode, although Dr. Z's character got on my last nerve PDQ.  It's not that Harris's Shakespeare In Space character is good, unfortunately the other cast members seem to be Lost In Scripts!  The space monsters/special effects are pretty lame, even for 1965 standards.  I just hope at least one episode will keep me interested to stay awake to the credits! Once I get through with the series I doubt I'll ever watch any of it again, I don't think it will even hold my grandson's interest, but it isn't fair to hold LIS against today's standards.  I agree The Outer Limits raised the bar higher than LIS could reach (storylines, actors, monsters, special effects), and the direction, or lack thereof dooms LIS too annoying to enter the ""camp"" camp.  The first season of LIS provided me with memories that will last a lunchtime, which will be the last season for me.  For the folks that do like LIS, the DVD's are done very nice.  The scene selection option is always a plus.  I like the newer thin space saver jewel boxes.  The video quality and sound are very nice- you won't be disapointed in these respects.  So slurp down a large cup of joe and enjoy (or try to) the show!

1868911,5,B00008YGRQ,"This is essentially Leave It To Beaver set in Outer Space but the show NEVER made any bones about it.  Lost In Space never tried to have the only slightly more adult themes of Star Trek.  Lost In Space is what it is.  Lost In Space was an obvious attempt to bring Christian family values to a science fiction setting.  Doctor Smith was an obvious evil bumbling foil who was almost a gay closet case in his screaming.  Lost In Space seems to have started out to be serious science fiction.  Soon as Doctor Smith started to make the show his weekly scream fest, I think all dreams of Lost In Space being serious science fiction went out of the window.  Lost In Space was three love stories.  Will and the Robot were best friends.  Penny had the Bloop (The chimp like animal!  Judy had Don West.  Of course Professor Robinson had his wife.  The Good Doctor Smith could never love anyone more than himself.  Technically Will Robinson was Doctor Smith's best friend.  People often ask why Doctor Smith was not beaten to death soon as he started his lying and cheating ways.  The answer is the innocent kid Will Robinson considered Doctor Smith a dear friend.  Doctor Smith was Will Robinson's pet human.  Doctor Smith was essentially a bad dog that screwed up any attempt to get back to earth.  In much the same way Gilligan always did things that kept the crew and passengers of the SS Minnow ship wrecked castaways on Gilligan's Island.

Yes to jaded minds born in the post Star Wars science fiction world where Star Trek went on to series that told you about warp cores, time rifts, transporters, anti matter power sources in wrenching pseudo realistic detail the science, acting and stories of Lost In Space just look weak.  However Lost In Space must be viewed in the context of its 1960's time frame where the idea of Space Travel was just beginning to become reality as man began the baby steps of going to Earth's moon.  I am an old coot so I remember watching Lost In Space as a kid.  I too wished many of the episodes had ventured into space.  That same dusty horrible planet the same rubber suited aliens week in and week out grew old quick even as a kid.  Part of what made Star Trek better than Lost In Space was the fact that the USS Enterprise was not a broken down hoopdy space ship that was not much more than a motor home  with busted motor stranded in an interstellar trailer park.  Redneck one dimensional aliens had to come back and visit the Robinson's each week for the show to continue which eventually wore the writers down and soon after the first season ended it showed big time.

The video quality is passable but not great.  In the first episode ALPHA CONTROL IS OVER LIT SO IT LOOKS AS IF IT WAS FILMED IN AN OLD GARAGE!  I remember when Lost In Space premiered.  I remember the light value was less so you could not see nearly as much of ALPHA CONTROL and it looked AWESOME beyond belief.  Some of what makes this set look so bad is the way it was rendered on DVD.  the original Lost In Space was carefully lit to leave some things to your imagination.  This brightly lit Lost In Space leaves nothing to the imagination and the weak plots, rubber aliens, paste rocks and wooden sets suffer unfairly because of it.  Irwin Allen was cheap so he reused everything a dozen times before he threw it away.  During the time Lost In Space was on the air, Allen was recycling sets to Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Time Tunnel, Land of the Giants and City Beneath the Sea that I know of maybe more.  Trust me Irwin Allen knew how to save a buck.  Don't get me wrong Irwin Allen went on to give us Earthquake, The only great truly original but later much copied version of Poseidon Adventure and my personal favorite The Towering Inferno.  Lost In Space is a testimonial to John Williams who scored Lost In Space and went on to bring us the music of Star Wars.  If you listen carefully to the musical scoring of Lost In Space you can hear the seeds of the lush lavish BIG BIG SOUND of Star Wars germinating in the fertile mind of John Williams.

I love this Lost In Space series even with all its flaws because; if one takes the Lost In Space DVD sets collectively in their time then you can't help loving them as I do.  Lost In Space is what it is a 1960's space opera heavy on the lily white, square old fart Christian family values that pervaded the times.  In the end Doctor Smith foppish antics remade Lost In Space into a comedy set in outer space as gone was any pretext of it being serious science fiction.  You just have to love Lost In Space for what it really was and stop thinking of it as the peer of serious 1960's Original Star Trek.  Anyone alive at the time knew Lost In Space and Star Trek were nothing alike and did not EVEN try to be.  Lost In Space has more in common with Space 1999 Year 2 with its rubber monsters, awesome music and weak plots.",1337990400,2,4885,4.331497797356828

1868914,2,B00008YGRQ,"I got a great deal, or so I thought so at the time, on all of Lost In Space. I paid $60 for the collection at a local pawn shop. In reviewing the show I have to admit that about all I could remember was perhaps the song, the robot and the annoying Dr. Smith.

I have watched four discs of Season one thus far and I have to tell you it is painful drudgery. I have figured out the set. The show must have been shot for the most part in some large warehouse that they filled with lots of sand. This desert landscape is highlighted with fake rocks, mostly leaveless dead trees and for the illusion of a landscape
we have distant murals or paintings to give the illusion of a skyline.

I like the land rover vehicle even though it is entirely impractical. I also doubt it could be watertight, as it was shown in one episode. The technology was pretty good for the time I guess. The show gave birth to the idea of molecular deconstruction and reconstruction which was utilized as the transporter on Star Trek. I also like Robbie The Robot. I've always liked the acting of the young girl who went on to be in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the second movie version. As a whole though this show is like some super wholesome 50's family that is Lost In Space. It's like Leave It To Beaver in Space. The family unit values trump the science fiction value of the show. Then there is the single guy and the single gal. What frustration to be a young man Lost In Space with a hot blonde at hand that the writers probably never let get near you.

The worst thing about this show though is Dr. Smith. Every single episode seems to be centered around his back stabbing evil ways. The man is dishonest, greedy, corrupt, a coward, a schemer, he is disloyal, he is a thief. The man is every wicked thing you can think of. Still Dr. Smith doesn't get what is coming to him. He gets booted out of the ship at times but he doesn't get the crap beat out of him. He doesn't get shot or locked up. The man is just an awful waste of space and he is the melodramatic foil to the Robinsons who are honest, virtuous, hard working, intelligent, wholesome, etc. Dr. Smith is so freaking rude to where I wonder how he doesn't get knocked on his butt in mid sentence.

I think the value of this show is how it sets us up for something great like Star Trek. Sure, the show is often entertaining and I sometimes wonder what might happen. The show is just too wholesome and the writing is weak. I want to see something besides SAND. I hate to think that the show never movies beyond that sandlot of season one. I know I'm tired already after four discs of seeing every episode set in a desert. I also hate the lovey dovey Robinson parents. Their ""love"" for each other is often just nauseating. It is very unrealistic.

I'll keep watching though, for a while at least. I want to get something out of the $60 I paid out for this collection. Right now I am watching and trying to find out what is worthwhile trying not to let the shows shortcomings ruin it all for me.",1330041600,,3030,4.226252158894646

As I was only 5 at the time, I expected I would have a different perspective this viewing. It was in Black and White? I thought that was just our T.V.! We did get a color T.V. later, and those later episodes were in color. The dialogue and acting, particularly the acting, was surprizingly good - considering some o' the cheezy plotlines. (did I mention the acting?). The 'sets' were amazing, as was the locations they were shot. So much so, that if it weren't for the . . . ""special effects"", it could easily pass as 'almost realistic'. What blew me away most though wasn't the things that were obviously faked, it was the things that weren't. The projector screens at Mission Control, don't see those much anymore. The Chariot; obviously the basic design for future Mars Rovers. A REAL vehicle. And the one thing that made me STOP THE FILM ! rewind, look again. I had to do an internet search. The Jet Pack. That was a real life Jet Pack flying around! While I know several may refer to this Series as ""cheesy"" for some o' it's content, I urge all fans o' the show - and those that haven't seen it yet - to have another look. This was true State of the Art Science 'Fiction'. It wasn't just ""the best they had at the time"", this was what they actually had at the time. Whether you enjoy the show for it's 'laughable' content ( I admit I did laugh when I saw the actors' head inside the Robot, and groaned at the alluminium foil Meteorites ) or just for the Characters themselves, you might be as surprized as I was to discover that, quite a few o' those ""props"", were not props.

1868961,5,B00008YGRQ,"The ""Lost In Space"" TV series was based on the comic book series ""Space Family Robinson"" published by Gold Key Comics back in 1960's.

The producer Irwin Allen made a lot of changes.  The original comic book series only had four crew members.  The mother and father who were scientists nad thei son and daughter, twins.  In fact, the characters on the TV series ""Penny Robinson"" and ""Will Robinson"" were originally supposed to be twins.  The TV show counter-arts do not even have the same first names as the original comic book characters.

There was no ""Doctor Smith"" and ""The Robot"" (or any robot) in the original comic book series.  These characters were made up for the TV series along with the two other characters pilot ""Major Don West"" and and older daughter of the of the Robinson family ""Judy Robinson.""

The spacecraft in the TV series ""The Jupiter 2"" did not even look like the spacecraft in the comic book series.

After the success of the TV series ""Lost In Space"" on CBS in 1965, Gold Key Comics retitled the comic book series ""Space Family Robinson LOST IN SPACE.""

You might also want to look up the archieves book of ""Space Family Robinson"" Volumes 1 and 2 on Amazon.com.

The ""Lost In Space"" DVD sets are good for younger viewers and the ""Space Family Robinson"" books are also good for youinger readers.

This DVD box set of the first and best season of the TV series ""Lost in Space,"" is definitely worth getting.  (The first season of the TV series was done in Black and White).

Unfortunately, when the ""Batman"" TV series came out on ABC in January 1966, the CBS executives decided to have the TV series go campy like the ""Batman"" TV series was.

The show also did not have a large enough budget required for the number and quality of props, costumes, and special effects needed for a sci-fi TV series.  This became even more apparaent in the following two seasons.

I like the TV series in general, but the first season was definitely the best season.",1314057600,,1972,4.572649572649572
1868962,4,B00008YGRQ,"A real classic from the Golden Age of TV.  Rather campy (especially toward the end of the season).  But, thoroughly enjoyable for anyone who was just a kid back then.  The videos are of excellent quality, and contain scenes not viewed since the original broadcast back in 1965.  Also, check out the un-aired pilot--a real treat.",1312156800,,328,4.803571428571429
1868963,5,B00008YGRQ,"I watched ""Lost in Space"" as a young girl when it was on reruns in the mid 1970s on WFLD-Channel 32/Chicago.  I absolutely LOVED this show.  As an adult, I was thrilled that these shows were released on DVD.  Season 1 was a very expensive set, but I paid the price because I was afraid some of my VHS copies were going to break or go bad.  I love the set.  I watched the series with my young daughter, who loves it now too.  I also shared it with my niece and nephew.  They are all fans now too.  Of course I bought seasons 2 and 3 when they were released.  How can you not love Dr. Smith runny scared from all those aliens?  I also enjoy the costumes the Robinson family and Don and Dr. Smith wore; they were so psychadelic, man.",1302134400,,730,4.041958041958042
1868964,3,B00008YGRQ,The best family centered Science Fiction TV series ever made. Only the First Season shows were the best. Back then the Robot was still a Robot not a full family member. And Dr. Smith had some really sinister plans for the Robinson family before he just got silly in later seasons.

1868966,5,B00008YGRQ,"Lost in Space has always been one of my favorite shows and I'm so happy to have the complete series on DVD...and Columbia House VHS...and off-air VHS. But clearly the DVD's come from the same analog transfer made circa 1990 for broadcast and the Columbia House videos. You can really tell the difference on an HD monitor when comparing to other standard definition transfers that were done digitally. I would say that after 20 years it's time for a new transfer in HD and a Blu-ray release! Anyone else agree? As LIS is surely Irwin Allen's most popular show, I believe it would turn out to be a good investment.

On a related note, I've seen others point out the ""jump-cuts"" present in a number of episodes. Those same jumps are present in the off-air recordings I made in the 90's and the Columbia House tapes. That also points to the DVD's coming from the same transfer.",1294876800,3,873,4.560509554140127
1868967,5,B00008YGRQ,"The poor, Robinson family - still lost! Well, at least at this point, it was still an adventure. After all, they were meeting aliens who were bright enough to speak to them - with British accents, no less!

This episode finds the family - well, part of it anyway - in the midst of a fairy tale. ""Sleeping Beauty"" comes to life for them with the young actress who played Gretl in ""The Sound of Music"" as the sleeping princess awakened by a reluctant kiss by Will - he was prompted to do this by The Robot. I suspect that her ""Sound of Music"" sister, Angela Cartwright, couldn't be in scenes with her - otherwise, the audience might have burst into song and ruined the ""serious"" notion of the episode!

To be honest, this is a charming episode, offering child-like (not childish) themes that captured the hearts of the children who grew up watching them. Well-casted, it offers a combination of space race and fairy tale that is sure to please the less jaded among us. Go into it with wonder and appreciation for the world that the actors place you in and enjoy it!",1292457600,,1063,4.446153846153846
1869007,4,B00008YGRQ,"I held off buying LOST IN SPACE for years before I finally picked up Season One.  Thank goodness the entire season is offered in one package -- unlike Seasons Two and Three that are shamelessly split.  During it original CBS run LOST IN SPACE was one of my favorite television shows.  It was on Wednesday nights at 7 PM on the local WCBS Channel 2.  As a kid I favored Season Three, but decades later I have to admit that Season One contained the best science fiction episodes of the series.

In Season One we find the Space Family Robinson accidentally diverted from their destination and eventually crash landed on a largely desert planet.  Along with the Robinsons is reluctant stowaway Colonel/Doctor Zachary Smith.  The real gem in watching Season One is to see the rapid transition of Dr. Smith from a cold blooded saboteur to a cowardly buffoon.  In fact about half way through the series LOST IN SPACE could very well have been retitled THE DOCTOR SMITH SHOW as a majority of the stories revolve around the antics of Dr. Smith.  This trend continued into Seasons Two and Three where the majority of stories focused on Dr. Smith, Will Robinson, and the Robot.

Countless people have catagorized LOST IN SPACE as ""campy.""  I admit that some of the episodes do look that way today.  However I also remember that when I first viewed the series as a child I did not find any of the activities outrageous or purely comic.  The Jupiter 2 spacecraft was cool looking.  I longed for my own Robot B-9 (the one I built out of supermarket carboard boxes did not quite look the part).  The bottom line is that LOST IN SPACE was a great show.  Hey, what about some of the notable guest stars in Season One?  Sesson One includes appearances  by Michael Rennie (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Werner Klemperer (Hogan's Heroes), Warren Oates (Sergeant Hulka from Stripes), and others.

LOST IN SPACE also has a wonderful soundtrack, particularly the scores composed by John (Johnny) Williams.  However during Season One you can also hear very recognizable music clips from the vast 20th Century Fox catalog including THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE ENEMY BELOW, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and THE YOUNG LIONS (among others).

The DVD image is great quality.  In fact the picture is so good that it is all too easy to spot things thay you would never have seen when the show made its original run.  LOST IN SPACE Season One also includes the unaired pilot.  Previously this pilot was not widely available.  The pilot contains no real surprises as the footage was essentially edited into episodes of the regular series.  For example, ever wonder why the Robinsons did not take the Robot along during their hurried Chariot trip south?  Why are they still wearing their winter parkas while crossing the inland sea on the return trip to the Jupiter 2?  Irwin Allen productions did not waste anything.  Everything was re-used.

This is a great DVD set for those who fondly remember the original series and/or its subsequent syndicated reruns.",1290470400,5,3027,4.721374045801527
1869008,5,B00008YGRQ,"This is the best season of this great family sci fi show. Even though it's in black and white, (it would be cool to see a digitalized colour version though). The show blasts off into solid action and fun with strong characters and  good special effects that still look great today. This season is good enough to watch over and over too. The second serics is way more pure fantasy in many episodes and it's not up to this standard of good storytelling generally. The show does pick back up when they return to space in the third season though. The famous robot here which is one of the best designs for a hollywood robot ever develops into it's own personality gradually over this season.  Making it a rare site in tv a machine as a main character. At least until buck rodgers and star trek the next generation comes along later. this is well worth owning and watching with your kids though because especially in it's early episodes this show is as good as the best of hollywood film from the sixties.

You just can't help but love the characters (even when they are being annoying-Dr. Smith). The story lines are imaginative and entertaining. I only wish the show had run for more than 3 seasons.

The first season is by far the best season of the series but all of them are good. I would highly recommend Lost in Space to anyone enjoying campy 60's sci-fi.",1286928000,2,503,4.408602150537634

  Since you have read all the reviews, I'll share a true story.

  My dad only laughed twice, that I can remember, when I was younger.
And one of those times, he laughed at Dr. Smith doing something nutty. I was so amazed that my dad laughed at that. (I was about 11 at the time).

  So many years alter, I wrote to Mr. Jonathan Harris, metioning that he gave my dad a laugh. Do you know what? Mr. Harris remembered that letter personally, when we met at a convention several years later.
  I said 'You made my dad laugh"", and Mr. Harris eyes shined, and he said 'I remember that letter!"",
What fond memories! So parents, get Lost In Space for your kids and grandkids to watch!

By the end of the season,Dr. Smith has mutated into the comic coward, the robot becomes a sassy straight man, and the show goes for fantasy instead of science fiction. There are so many elements I love about this show, the characters, the Jupiter-2, the music, the robot, the plots. Truly a gem.",1276560000,2,557,4.470588235294118

1869016,4,B00008YGRQ,"Lost In Space was a campy 60's sci-fi show, no doubt.  However, the first season is special, in that the first half of the season contains more SCI than FI.  If the other 2 seasons would've followed the format of Season 1, Lost In Space might have been one of the great Sci-Fi series of all time.  Alas, it never happened, as the series made a turn towards family-oriented camp.

That being said, Season 1 is a must-have for even the casual Lost In Space fan.  Very underrated is Johnathan Harris' acting.  Although he plays the villain, and later the goofy fall guy, his acting always outshined the rest of the cast.

So why did I give this DVD set only 4 stars?  For one simple reason:  There's no option to play all episodes on the disc.  Maybe it's a quirk of mine, but whenever I buy a whole season of a TV show, I like to hit ""play all"", and then watch all, or simply fall asleep during the playback.  LIS is one of the few season series that does not have that option, and in my book, it's a rather major drawback.

On the bright side, the quality of the episodes is top-notch.  Never has Lost In Space appeared so clearly to me.  The DVD does have excellent chapter divisions for each episodes, but I just can't understand why it didn't feature the ""play all episodes"" option.",1265500800,3,1284,4.317991631799163

The show's first season was the best of the three seasons it was on the air; Very good for its day. Too bad they went off the track, though, turning the series into an oft-times campy, silly fantasy. But, I highly recommend season one for any science-fiction fan who doesn't mind a look at sci-fi in its early days.

""The Raft"" is actually about a small alien space craft which the Robinson family see as promising as a venue to send a messenger to earth with information on their whereabouts so that a rescue could be launched. Of course, Dr. Smith again ruins everything. Billy Mummy (Will) plays a central role in this episode.
This episode is well worth one's time.",1242777600,,596,4.740384615384615
1869040,4,B00008YGRQ,"This show was ahead of its time in every way except one. It debuted in dreary black and white. This fit the genre for westerns, but 60s sci-fi was too campy for a lack of color. And for a show with a big budget that ultimately lead to its cancellation, CBS should have rushed the color age. A B&W debut detracted from then state of the art special effects.

However, the reason why LIS still stays with fans is not for the typical kneejerk nostalgia associated with generations brought up on it. No, this goofy show stuck with you because of elements overlooked that made many oldie TV series head and shoulders above modern fare---the soundtracks. None other than a legend of audio magic, John Williams, was LIS composer.

This show, burdened by a weak unaired pilot which was split into several later episodes, had such a built-in audio aura that the music was like the uncredited star of the show. It was its own character support for each and every scene, be it conflict, amusement, horror or resolution. So its shelf life was always recycled with familiar mood and atmosphere.

The 1st season, with too many alien creatures manned in cheap suits, is not the best despite popular consensus. Space camp was at a height with many monsters, space ships and plot devices poorly developed. LIS didn't come into its own until the 2nd & 3rd seasons when Dr. Smith, Will, the Robot and weekly alien guest star imagination merged with living color.

I never saw LIS in color as a kid. Finally doing so at the end of the 1st season made me gush sentimental. Although its sound is what won me over, that quality alone was and is better than modern HD digital color shows that often lack colorful audio. LIS endures as a prime example why oldie TV was classic. Because regardless of visuals, it sounded better.",1242691200,3,1802,4.604361370716511

But , in showing him participating in fishing like one of the boys, it also establishes the Robot as a valid member of the Robinson family,rather than an appliance.

When the Evil robot made Robot look pathetic and outdated in order to gain the Robinson's exclusive trust, I actually felt bad for the big metal guy. So the family continues to put more trust in the Evil robo,unheedful of Robot's warnings. Only Will believes him, and as the Robinsons find out too late, Robot was right.

1869082,4,B00008YGRQ,"This is an example of a show with a lot of potential, which was spoiled by Hollywood. Fortunately, the first season of the show lived up to some of that potential.
The first season of Lost in Space is fairly well done, and very watchable. It brought back a lot of fond memories, and that alone was worth the money.
The show started out on the right foot, on a somewhat more serious note than the later seasons.  Dr. Smith was a serious badguy in the first half of this season, which made the show more interesting, and kept the Robinsons on their toes.
Seeing his evolution from a murderous traitor into simply a greedy, self-absorbed, nutcase was entertaining, as was seeing the robot change from a walking ashcan, which barely spoke, into a major character on the show.
All the characters are great, and seeing the interaction between Will, Dr. Smith, and the robot was entertaining, as always. The Robinson's adventures on the strange planet they land on were also (mostly) equally good.
They fight giant monsters, find lost civilizations, and interact with the scores of aliens found in space, in this series.
Not too profound, but the show was never meant to be like Star Trek. Kind of refreshing in these days where everyone is trying to send some message, meant to be profound.
Lost in Space may well have become as popular as Star Trek, if Irwin Allen had kept the show going in the same direction as seen here. It got off to a good start, anyway.
I enjoyed it, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who likes classic TV space opera. The second and third seasons (with a few episodes excepted) are another matter.......

1869117,5,B00008YGRQ,"I don't know if combining Forbidden Planet with Seinfeld and Gilligan's Island is exactly on target, but there are elements of all three. I was in second grade when this show premiered, and I never missed an episode. The stories were always interesting to me, and even at age eight the character of Dr. Smith absolutely captured my imagination. There are aspects of this fellow that are so very interesting - here is a guy with a great deal of education who never seems to have learned anything from the mythology he is always reciting to everyone, as in ""All That Glitters"", my all-time favorite episode. He didn't remember the tragedy of King Midas when he was making his wish? His greed and his cowardice override any mental advantage he may have. He is truly the George Costanza of space exploration - whenever he stumbles upon a piece of good fortune he has to milk it for all it's worth until the whole situation turns on him. Then there are the children - Will and Penny. No matter what Dr. Smith does they still like the guy, and he does a lot. He bargains with aliens to take Will's brain for their experiments instead of his, and in another episode turns Penny into platinum, although he does feel remorse about the latter deed. In fact, the children are Smith's only friends. He is merely tolerated by the adults, and for good reason.

Finally there is the ""innocence and chastity beyond reason"" element that was part of Gilligan's Island and is part of this show too. Despite the only natural and healthy attraction between Major Donald West and Judy Robinson, we are to believe that nothing really happens between the two for years on end. Also like Gilligan's Island, although the group's first priority starts off as finding a way to return to earth, eventually they settle into a kind of domestic tranquility and seem to make peace with their situation of being ""lost in space"".

Of course, rewatching this series over forty years later, it is not quite as great as I remembered it, but it is still great fun and Smith is still a fascinating character. It's also interesting to see what people in the 1960's thought earthly civilization would be like in 1997. It's humorous yet somewhat tragic to see the optimistic viewpoint people had of the future in the 1960's pertaining to human nature. What the series' creators couldn't foresee is that today people are much more like Zachary Smith than the Robinson family - at least the people in charge of things are.",1187222400,6,2477,4.665903890160183

1869155,5,B00008YGRQ,"I gather Bill Mumy would be my age by now when this series came out in the 1960's. I had the same color hair he did: Reddish, honey colored as a boy, when I was his age.  I was amazed to see Hollywood save this series.  It's simply a lot of fun to watch and it brings back great memories of my youth.

The story line is a no brainer to understand: A future family sets off for outer space to reach a new planet.  The original pilot used the music from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", while having little character conflict to make it interesting.  Eventually, Johnathan Harris was offered the role as Dr. Smith by 20th Century Fox executives. Smith enters as the ""criminal-evil"" element to help liven up the scripts.  He originally boards the Jupiter Two to sabotage the mission of the Robinson Family who go into early hibernation for their long space flight.  When Dr. Smith gets trapped on board the Jupiter Two, with his plans having gone awry to sabotage the Jupiter's flight mission, he's forced to wake the whole family for help before everyone is killed along with himself.  The robot was originally not to be in the television series, but the studios insisted on the robot and introduction of Dr. Smith to add interesting plot twists for the TV series.  Its a good thing this was added in or I don't think the series would have lasted the three years it did.

Originally, the opening episodes were more of a serious vein, but as the series progressed, it got to be more on the corn side as scripts were written to introduce top named actors of that day into the episodes.  Regardless, the whole thing is nothing but fun to watch: Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.

As I thought back in time, as I watched the DVD's, I remember even creating a Hollyween costume out of cardboard, can you believe it, and dressed up as the robot when I was about age 9 or 10.  Got lots of candy for my ingenuity!  It had blinking lights and servo motors in the front.  We were poor back then growing up, so there was ample room for imagination.  I had to raid a number of garbage cans of old liquor stores to get the servo motors off their old displays while buying parts from Radio Shack to create my blinking lights.  Loads of fun to do!

The packaging of the product is just fine and the quality of each DVD is also excellent!  No complaints.  It was fun to start and remember some of the old episodes watching the series.

As a hybrid of Rod Serling class irony (read the willows by Algernon Blackwood written 100 years ago, and remember that Rod Serling wrote the screenplay to the original Planet of the Apes movie for more about what I call ""the twist that turns away"" - which is from Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land - the definitive Science Fiction Novel) and the Dr. Who class no-budget production (see also Ed Wood - not just the Oscar winning performance of Martin Landau - but the actual Plan Nine from Outer Space for more on this)

And the music was great -

I remember a giant carrot monster, which is probably why I don't eat carrots.

And like modern film versions of 60's shows I think the film is great - Gary Oldman as Dr, Smith - if that doesn't get you Heather Graham should.

Lost in Space - up there with Land of the Lost - provides more intrinsic commentary from people who have no idea of the source than any thing else I know - cause stuff we saw when we were 3 we remember -

it's time to go back to the beginning and see the roots, and this show is pivotal - and some of the original actors show up - like on the Simpson's and elsewhere -

If you never saw it because you are too young get in your time machine and go back to the dawn of science fiction drama along with Star Trek this show is a land mark - two show who originally aired at the same time who franchise is alive today in modern time in film -

Subsequent seasons became sillier and focused on Dr. Smith, the robot and young Will Robinson. The rest of the cast was mostly ignored and the quality of the show suffered.

1869209,4,B00008YGRQ,"I remember how much I liked the series when I was about 13 years years old (back in...1997!) Now at 22 my enjoyment of the series hasn't diminished a bit or at least almost nothing.

Season 1 was probably the best, especially the very first episodes where it actually works as science fiction and Dr. Smith's character was much more menacing (it has been interesting to see how his character evolved into a complete sissy, and he's actually supposed to be doctor but Will Robinson seems more accomplished than him in virtually every way).

Despite the fact that it supposed to be a sci fi show, it still manages to collapse in stereotypes of 60's TV shows regarding the type of family it portrays. however,it becomes obvious not long after that this show was supposed to be marketed for families and mostly at the kiddies. And yet the never ending adventures of the space family Robinson click with both audiences young and old. I mean, let's face it, this show was way more popular than time tunnel or voyage to the bottom of the sea, which were much more scifi themed.

I bought the first season dvds last year and it was an a thrill to be able to hear the main theme at the beginning all over again after all this years since the show went off the air in latin american FOX channel. And while the show on DVD looks better than when shown in broadcast there's still a lot to be desired. the episodes have not been remastered or restored in any way. As a matter of fact there's a lot of indication that they were sourced from the same masters used to create the previously available VHS tapes: There are horizontal resolution lines visible in many episodes which indicates the transfer's analog origins(sometimes noticiable, mostly not, but at some point you'll notice them); also, the VHS tapes of a couple of episodes had been cut in certain areas, the main examples were the pilot show is missing a scene of Dr. Smith being interrogated and episode ""Return from outer space"" omits a brief moment which leaves a scene without sense, this cuts are also present on the current DVDs; but the final indication of course is the overall lack of resolution in the episodes, being episode No 2. ""The Derelict"" the worst offender, having a huge vertical black bar on the right side of the image and a white vertical line in the picture area also at the right near the end of the visible image (however you won't see the black bar due to your TV's overscanning and the white line will be scene only occasionally since it's also near the end of the image). The only real bonus feature is the unaired pilot episode which is a great addition (even though it is hardly a revelation since it has been seen already on video and TV and it's footage has been reused on the first episodes). Besides that, there's only a CBS network presentation which is nothing else but a commercial for the network advertisers (it just shows scenes of the unaired pilot along with a narration telling you how great and top quality the show is). After all of this, FOX is actually asking $80.00 MSRP for each season of the show when a remastered season of Voyage to the bottom of the sea (which by the way, includes many extras and audio commentaries) costs only $40 MSRP! However they need not to worry about sales since LIS has such a big fan base wiling to buy whatever is thrown to them (and if Fox issues an ultimate edition they'll buy it again and at a higher price).

Still, on an average TV set like mine you'll be more than satisfied with it, but I was expecting a better treatment for a series of this caliber, especially since it's so high priced and yet so cheaply put together.",1159660800,7,3659,4.497744360902256

The observant viewer will quickly identify re-cycled sets, props, gimmicks, and even plot points, but this only adds to the enchantment and warmth of the experience for someone with late-50's and early-60's sensibilities.  What some viewers may revile as cheesy and cheap, other viewers will embrace as heart-warming and winsome. Clunky effects and deficient costumes are only a plus.

Beautiful in concept & excellent in execution, we see the Gemini-Jupiter spacecraft as a unique ship to propel the Robinsons to Alpha Centauri and to survive the journey thru space.

This series is what Lost In Space is all about...survival!!

The endearing aspects of the show, to me, has always been the triumphant overcoming of Professor Robinson and Don to obstacles and dangers. A good fatherly spirit and ethical attitude is portrayed nicely by Professor Robinson even as they are plunged into the unknown void, off course from reaching Alpha Centauri. As you will see the dangers they face are immediate upon their first crash landing on Preplanus and the confrontation with the Giant seen on the Episode, ""There were Giants on the Earth"". The stories in short were well written and highly imaginative. Episodes like ""Invaders From The 5th Dimension"" and ""The Keeper"" are unforgettable! The episode ""The Raft"" is the start where they attempt to derive a synthesized deutronium fuel source to leave Preplanus in the first series, we fans-true fans of the show always sat at the edge of our seats wondering ...are they going to lift off soon? Did they solve their deutronium fuel problem? This series showed very cool special effects and great acting by Guy Willaims and Mark Goddard.  The first season shows the Doctor's legendary nsanity and developing humor prevelant in the 2nd series. Oh the pain....the pain.

Every Lost In Space fan MUST get this DVD! This series redefined special effects at that time during the 1960's. The Jupiter 2 is delicately designed and beautifully portrayed on the Alpha Control Launch Pad!

The engine sound too in the episode ""The Derelict"" was the coolest sound at that time for a spaceship with an antigravity drive!!! Enjoy!!",1153008000,10,2007,4.982089552238806
1869212,5,B00008YGRQ,"Simply a joy! I was in elementary school when Lost in Space first aired. I adored the show. It was the only program that I was allowed not to miss. The DVD package is first rate with clean crisp recordings. Sure it's campy. But for it's time, it was wonderful. And still is today to those of us that have a nostalgic connection to it. I could berate the special effects of the 1960's (seeing the wall seam of the desert set) but why? It's the story and the characters that count. Dr. Smith's constant fear of the unknown and his persistent desire to go home to earth at any cost subliminally connects him to all of us. No matter how much he frustrates us, we can relate to him! Dr. Smith's trapped fear-filled scream at take-off is chilling even today. And seals the deal for escaping into this classic sci-fi story.

I am continually impressed with the direction of Season 1 episodes. Seasons 2 and 3 pale in comparison. This may be due to color taking precedence over direction. For example, the next time you watch ""One of our dogs is missing"" in Season 1, pay careful attention to the framing of shots. Directing in black and white is an art. It is done extraordinarily well in this episode. Use of creative aerial shots, close-ups and various angle shots add to the suspense and bring deeper dimension to all the characters. The illusion of distance in travelling across the planet on foot is also very well done. Superior direction brought a believability and depth to the story and the characters that was an integral part of the show's initial success. Kudos to the directors and the care they took in making a classic.",1152057600,7,1627,4.534013605442177

Great cast, silly production - It would have been nice had Irwin Allen been more serious with the storyline, because the actors were wonderful. But it was fun and entertaining, nevertheless.",1150502400,3,502,4.273684210526316
1869234,3,B00008YGRQ,"I own all three seasons of Lost in Space on DVD and can't wait till I'm through with the last season, because, frankly I'm sick of it. I've been watching with my kids, ages 2-14, but only ages 2-12 actually appreciate it anymore.

The first season is the best, and the pilot episode is surprisingly good as early TV sci-fi. But it ultimately deteriorates into weary formulaic, camp. If you are at all interested, just buy a few episodes at a time. Even if you think you are incurably nostalgic, as my wife and I thought we would be, that feeling was mostly gone by the end of the first season and completely disappeared after just a few episodes of season two. The transition from black & white to color was mildly interesting but didn't help make a better series.

Though thoroughly despicable and infuriating with no redeeming virtue, Dr. Smith really is the most interesting character (thanks to the relatively creative Jonathan Harris). Apparently, Dr. Smith has instilled all my children with a strong belief in capital punishment for traitors, saboteurs, and kidnappers, and perhaps an unhealthy and never satiated desire to see Dr. Smith utterly destroyed by some alien or self-inflicted mishap.

Even more conflicted are the feelings we eventually get from watching the Robinson parents show after show. What the writers probably meant as role models of unconditional forgiveness quickly turns into disturbing examples of insane incompetence that rivals or exceeds that of Dr. Smith. What kind of parent leaves children (and an extremely powerful robot) alone and in the hands of an unfettered and unrepentant diabolically greedy, self-serving, desperate, cowardly, hedonistic, murderous, deceitful, kidnapping, hijacking, professional assassin and saboteur? ...after nearly killing them or losing them forty times in a row? The show is maddening, I tell you. Once you learn the hidden (and perhaps unintentional) lesson of the series, you should definitely stop watching it.

Someone should just make a best of episode list so people can merely download those ones at the iTunes store.

On the bright side, Lost in Space has really got me hyped on watching my Star Trek collection, which I've been saving till our family finishes off this goofy precursor. The connection and progress from this sci-fi series to the next is quite evident, from story ideas to music.",1150329600,11,2373,5.089974293059126
1869235,5,B00008YGRQ,"What can I say Lost In Space? Along with Doctor Who, this would have to be one of my favorite science fiction shows ever. It's great to have a contrast to the very serious Doctor Who and that's what gets me in with this sci-fi show. I like to have a contrast to the very serious Doctor Who... IT IS TO BE NOTED, THIS CAME BEFORE STAR TREK! ...What a great light-hearted retro show it was! This first season is done in Black and white. It's not until Season 2 where it's done in color to compete with the already color show Batman. I loved every bit of this seas from start to finish. Great family, great stories told from a light-hearted point of view. You'll hate Doctor Smith, but love the conservatism with John Robinson of how he deals with his family. Note: If you are new to Lost In Space Major West and Zachery Smith aren't family members. When I was very young, I thought they were! Watching a show from the beginning helps!

This show is set in the future - 1997...  about their journey from earth to Alpha Centauri -- a new place to inhabit for human beings as Earth is overpopulated -- so true!

The show makes you feel you are apart of the action. You get sad when the show gets sad, you feel happy when Robinson's are happy. You feel angry at Doctor Smith when he is up to his old tricks. The show has empathy for other forms of life they come across. It allows you to see things from their point of view and not just humans! This show is pure fantasy. It's pure imagination. That's why you shouldn't care if it's camp or not! The show, although was serious in the first few episodes, Irwin Allen obviously wanted to have fun and make people enjoy the adventure!

Only thing I didn't like was there wasn't much extras and there was no commentary. You click the audio button and you hear different languages like Spanish and French, but don't hear any commentary! But then again, sometimes commentaries (in my opinion) spoils the ""trade secrets"" of show.

If you like it retro like Batman and Thunderbirds, you'll love this! Sit down and enjoy the ride in the Jupiter 2!",1148083200,5,2082,4.369509043927649
1869236,5,B00008YGRQ,"If only Irwin Allen could have kept the quality of the first season in later years of this childhood favorite. The premier season of this program, for all of its dated effects, was very well written and made good use of all the cast members.

Dr. Smith, while a much darker character, was perfect during year one. He exuded the right balance of intelligence, menace and guile. It's too bad he became such a sniveling coward in seasons 2 and 3.

All and all , a great nostalgic trip.  Excellent video and audio quality and loved the extras.",1147996800,8,539,4.479591836734694
1869237,5,B00008YGRQ,"Lost in Space was Irwin Allen's black and white '60s TV spinoff of the Space Family Robinson comic books. It featured the best robot in a long time, B-9, created by the designer of Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet. The TV show has almost nothing in common with the recent movie which apparently just bought the name, and which was entirely miscast with the possible exception of Joey from Friends and the cameo by June Lockhart.

As many reviewers have pointed out, the show began serious and gradually slipped into farcical. But I remember being riveted to the TV set even for those episodes. There were too many serious things on TV anyway. The popularity of the series led to numerous toys, most of which are highly collectible today. One happy accident of the movie was that New Line licensed Trendmasters to make toys related to it. The spaceships from the movie were quite bad, as was the movie robot. But they also brought back the classic B-9 robot in toys that were much better than the '60s ones ever were.

This is one of the best packaged DVD sets I've seen, with one disc per plastic case for each of the eight discs, four episodes per disc except on the last disc, which contains one episode, an ""unaired pilot"" and a PR presentation originally shown to sell the show. Fans will welcome back the crew of the Jupiter Two and the exploits of the Space Family Robinson.",1142467200,2,1383,4.550200803212851
1869238,5,B00008YGRQ,"These shows are just as good as I remember them 30 years ago. My 11 year old son loves them. The special effects pale in comparison to today's movies like Star Wars but the stories are so strong that they can stand on their own without all the high-tech eye candy we see today. The man who plays Dr. Smith is truly a phenomenal actor which is something I was not able to appreciate when I first saw the shows at age 10. It's amazing that Hollywood is not even capable of coming up with an idea this unique and entertaining without having to force feed us plots involving drugs, sex, and junior high school locker room humor. Most of the shows strike a very good balance between not being too scary and not being too silly. If the plots went too far one way or the other I don't think my kids would like watching them. My son is already asking if we can get Season 2 and I definitely plan on doing it. In my opinion, if you like good stories, good plots, and just plain good entertainment, then you'll like this show. If you are looking for intellectual science fiction shows like Star Trek, which are geared towards adults, then you probably won't like this as much.",1142294400,5,1166,4.304545454545455
1869239,4,B00008YGRQ,"You can count the number of science fiction television shows that left a lasting impression on viewers on your fingers.  As campy as ""Lost in Space"" sometimes was, it left an impression that is nearly as strong for many people as the impression that ""Star Trek"" left.  Of course ""Star Trek"" was a much bolder show, and tried to present some of the infinite possibilities that exist in the universe.  ""Lost in Space"" reached only a brief distance into the future and was the first non-animated television show that focused on a family of space pioneers.  There are plot holes galore.  Dr. Smith has to be one of the most obnoxious central characters in a television show ever.  And yet, I retain my fondness for this show.

There are 29 black and white episodes from the first season in this collection.  This collection also has the ""unaired"" pilot episode, which contains truth and fiction.  The pilot episode was originally unaired, but I am sure that I have seen that episode, perhaps on the Science Fiction Channel.  Many portions of the pilot episode also found their way into some of weekly episode.  This collection also has a promotional film used to sell advertisers on the show.

The series began quite seriously, and remained relatively serious throughout much of the first season, though there were lapses into farce and camp.  The series begins on earth with the auspicious purpose of sending the first of many families on a pioneer voyage into space.  Dr. Smith, who began the series as a calcuating, cold-blooded individual, sabotages the mission.  Unfortunately for bumbling Dr. Smith, he is caught on board the spaceship as it takes off.  The ship is damaged by Dr. Smith's sabotage and goes off course, eventually settling on a planet, where it remains for the entire first season.

Some of the episodes held much promise for what the series could have been.  ""My Friend, Mr. Nobody,"" with guest William Bramley, explored the origins of possible galactic life and the meaning of intelligence.  ""The Sky Is Falling"" with guests Don Matheson, Francois Ruggieri and Eddie Rosson explored how we might encounter families from other species and wondered whether we might react as intelligent beings or paranoid, prejudiced, suspicious beings.

Guest stars ranged quite far.  The iconic Michael Rennie of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" fame appeared in an episode where our possible relationship to others in the universe was explored.  A very young Kurt Russell tried to prove his worth against Will Robinson, and John and Will Robinson managed to teach both Kurt and father Michael Ansara something about being a father and son.  Character actor Albert Salmi appeared as a pirate in a fun episode.  Robbie the Robot guest appeared in one episode.  Michael J. Pollard, who would later appear on the television show ""Star Trek"" (episode titled ""Miri""), appeared as a boy in a dimension behind mirrors.  Sherry Jackson played a beautiful hick in an episode, and would also appear in ""Star Trek"" (episode titled ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"").  Some of the other numerous guests include Werner Klemperer (""Hogan's Heroes""), Royal Dano, and Kym Karath (""The Sound of Music"").

I think it is easy in this age of sophisticated digital effects and a chain of quality and classic science fiction television that extends back to at least the original ""Outer Limits"" to look down on ""Lost in Space"" as unworthy of appreciation.  However, the series was influential and it was memorable.  Had Irwin Allen been allowed to maintain the serious nature of the show, it is possible that ""Lost in Space"" would have been the landmark television show that ""Star Trek"" became.  I know I watched both, and I know I enjoyed ""Star Trek"" when it came out the year following the debut of ""Lost in Space.""  I considered myself lucky that two such wonderful shows were on at the same time.

I look back on ""Lost in Space"" with fondness, and I absolutely enjoyed watching every single episode in this collection.  I know I will enjoy the episodes in season 2 and season 3.  Perhaps my fondness is all nostalgia.  If so, I will revel in my nostalgia and just maybe I will watch all the episodes one more time.

As a side note, after being a little boy and watching ""Lost in Space,"" I admired Will Robinson a lot.  I credit Will being a role model for my later years when I studied electronics and physics in college.  This show may have been campy, but I am glad that I was encouraged by a show like this one.  Perhaps we should all wish for more campy science fiction shows to encourage children to become scientists and engineers.",1139356800,18,4620,4.79873417721519
1869240,4,B00008YGRQ,"OK, a lot of people laugh about Lost in Space. What was originally intended as a action/adventure series unfortunately evolved into a farce. But many people still

regard this series first season as a milestone. And it still is. It has solid production

values, and was and is a visual treat today. The FX were fantastic for it's time. For

me personally, the first 10 episodes I thought were very well done. We were treated

to spaceships, aliens and really cool hardware. In 1965, this was spellbinding.

The best of it all was the robot. Cold and under control, was a true menace. Dr. Smith

was a cruel and murderous adversary. Purists will cry foul as we see the development

Although some of the monsters was quite cheesy looking it still captivates the young and the young at heart. Look at what this series has to offer. From everybodies favorite TV mom of the 60's maybe of all-time June Lockheart. Watching Angela Cartwright (Penny) and Billy Mumy (Will) grow up while trekking through 3 seasons. A villan Dr. Smith that you'd like to throw in the blackhole. And who wouldn't want this robot for a friend? The only problem I had with the series is that CBS wouldn't let the writers send the Family Robinsons back to earth when the series came to an end. I mean at least Gilligan finally got off the Island. The special features are worth the viewing as well as the commentaries featuring Billy Mumy and Johnathan Harris.

1869270,4,B00008YGRQ,"I was 12 years old in the fall of 1965 when Lost in Space first came out, and I can still remember being riveted to my bw tv on Wednesday nights.  It is hard to describe the youthful awe and excitement that this show inspired in me---a unique and exciting spaceship, a wonderful sense of adventure on alien worlds, ocasionally spooky and really scary aliens, etc.  Over the years images and events from the series were still stuck in my mind:  a ship in space with strange aliens capturing the Jupiter II, a crash landing on an alien planet, a raging storm in the ""Chariot"" on an alien sea, an invisible alien called ""Mr. Nobody"", an alien zookeeper, a cyclopean giant, and more.

I hadn't seen the series at all since that time, until I came across the DVD on Blockbuster and rented the first 4 episodes of Season 1:  ""The Reluctant Stowaway, The Derelict, Island in the Sky, and There Were Giants in the Earth"".  When I put it in I was telling myself that all these years later as a mature adult that I would surely be underwhelmed.

And boy was I wrong!

Lost in Space, at least the first season, still inspires and fascinates.  Everything that I remembered from my childhood was still there.

Although there are periods of somewhat sappy dialogue, the stories are entertaining and filled with wonder and adventure.  The show really hits its stride in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th episodes.  Who can forget the image of the Jupiter II circling the alien ship in space, and how it is captured, and the strange creatures inside.  The shots of the Jupiter II sweeping over the landscape of an alien planet are still jaw-dropping today.  The scenes of the Chariot moving over the alien landscape and the deserted alien city at the end of episode 4 still thrill and fill me with a sense of wonder.

Allthough the first season was in black and white, for some reason it seems to enhance the aura of mystery and alien-ness of the show.  On the DVD I rented (which is part of the larger 1st season package) most of the episodes were clear and crisp.  There is some grain and fuzziness to the second episode ""The Derelict"" as though it was not made from a Master negative.

All in all, I highly recommend this dvd set to fans of the show.  It would also make a good gift for a youngster who likes sci-fi.",1127520000,7,2291,4.437799043062201

One source said along time ago that 20th Century Fox had considered it and I wish we would have had the choice to decide. Yes ""Classic Black and White"" is an original, but I also like ""Color"" (Colorized), and I would like to hope that they will still consider it down the road. I now own all 3 season of the entire series and I still give it a 5 star rating with all the bonuses that are in it. I hope this review helps.",1123545600,3,694,4.148148148148148
1869272,5,B00008YGRQ,"I've always been a Lost in Space fan. From the days when I was very young when Mr. Keema scared me when he revealed himself, to rediscovering it in the late 80's to watching it now for ""warm fuzzy"" memories, the show has always entertained me. At my younger age, I loved Season 2. As a teen, I loved Season 3 and now, I find that Season 1 was simply the best.

Season 1 opens with 5 dramatic and suspenseful episodes that rival some of the best sci fi / adventure stories out there. While this isn't ""good"" science, it is fun. Lost in Space rarely, if at all, came close to the adventure and true danger shown in the first 5 episodes of season 1. They go from nearly being killed in an asteroid belt, to almost destroyed by the Robot and ultimately fighting the elements on a strange planet. I won't go in the ""science"" of the show because it wasn't good and logic and continuity (what happened to the dog they found?!?!) were not closely followed. This show was about a close family and their adventures in outer space. Period.

Lost in Space started out as a serious survival story and most of the first season deals with that. Despite a road bump with ""Welcome, Stranger"", the first half of Season 1 was very dramatic in its impact. The family had to find food, shelter, water at the same time as battling the unknown and sometimes hostile creatures. Then, the show takes a lurching turn with The Sky Pirate and rarely looks back. From that point on, the main focus of the show was ""comedic villain"" of the week and how Will, Smith and the Robot deal with the issue with Dad coming to the rescue most of the time.

Despite the format change, the remaining first season episodes still had a lot of charm and excitement to them. ""All that Glitters"" shows a remorseful side of Smith that we rarely see. ""Follow the Leader"" is one of the best ""alien possession"" episodes of the series. And the ""Magic Mirror"" has a very surreal mood that the series never approached again.

The cast was generally consistent in their performances. Guy Williams was solid, Angela Cartwright (when given a good story) could melt your heart, and June Lockheart was one of the best TV moms. Who know that Jonathan Harris' Dr. Smith would become one of the most memorable characters in television history?

Season 1 doesn't feature anything in the way of interesting extras. We do get the unaired pilot which is only interesting in the fact it has no Robot or Dr. Smith. The rest of that pilot was cut into most of the first 5 episodes. The back and white quality of the DVD's is crisp and excellent.

Lost in Space will always have a place in my heart. Each season of the show had its own unique personality. Season 1 was about survival and adjustment to their situation and it is the very best of the three season series.",1121990400,11,2800,4.437743190661479
1869273,5,B00008YGRQ,"""Lost in Space"" (1965-68) told the story of the space family Robinson, who left Earth aboard their Jupiter II spacecraft on a five-year voyage to explore a planet in the Alpha Centauri system, our nearest neighbor in the galaxy. But then Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), an enemy spy, sabotaged the control system but did not get off the ship before it took off. ""Lost in Space"" were Dr. John Robinson (Guy Williams of ""Zorro""), his wife Maureen (June Lockhart from ""Lassie""), daughters Judy (Marta Kristen from ""Beach Blanket Bingo"") and Penny (Angela Cartwright from ""Make Room for Daddy"" and ""The Sound of Music""), and son Will (Billy Mumy from a memorable episode of ""The Twilight Zone""). The ship's pilot was Major Don West (Mark Goddard from ""The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor) and completing the crew was the Robot (Bob May in the suit but Dick Tufeld providing the voice).

To be clear from the start, even though the first season of ""Lost in Space"" was in black & white it was the best season.  That is because when the Robinsons first blasted off in the Jupiter II this was a dramatic science fiction show.  By the end of that first season it was starting to change into more of a situation comedy and the last two seasons all too often involved the comedy team of Dr. Smith, Will and the Robot.  But the first five episodes are classic science fiction that hold up to ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Outer Limits,"" or ""Star Trek"" in terms of 1960s television.  There are also enough solid episodes to make up for the lame ones, plus the pure nostalgic value of this particular series for those of us who grew up on 1960s television, to justify rounding up to a five star rating.

A lot of the credit for the strong start goes to Shimon Wincelberg, who began writing television scripts for the ""Kraft Television Theater"" and ended with ""Law & Order.""  In between he did scripts for ""Voyage to the Bottom fo the Sea,"" ""The Time Tunnel,"" ""Star Trek"" (""Dagger of the Mind"" and ""The Galileo Seven""), and the stories for the first five episodes of ""Lost in Space"": (1) ""The Reluctant Stowaway"" show how Dr. Smith's presence caused the Jupiter II to go astray; (2) ""The Derelict"" is where the Jupiter II is taken aboard an alien spaceship; (3) ""Island in the Sky"" is the one where the Jupiter II makes a spectacular crash landing on an alien world;  (4) ""There Were Giants in the Earth"" is where the Robinsons explore Priplanus and encounter the giant cyclops; and (5) ""The Hungry Sea"" has the planet showing the crew a rough time.  If you accept the premise of an American family blasting off into space and having to survive on an alien world, what happens is certainly more realistic than idealistic.

Unfortunately, after that point ""Lost in Space"" because a show of weekly guest stars as aliens stop by for a visit, beginning with Warren Oates as space cowboy Jimmy Hapgood in (6) ""Welcome Stranger.""  There would also be Albert Salmi as Alonzo P. Tucker (18) ""The Sky Pirate"" and in the first season low point Mercedes McCambridge as Sybilla, the head of (25) ""The Share Croppers.""  The other constant theme is that Dr. Smith causes trouble in his desperate attempts to get back to Earth, which means everything from giving an alien Will's brain in (8) ""Invaders from the Fifth Dimension"" and trading the Robot for food in (23) ""The Space Trade"" to becoming ruler of an alien world in (24) ""His Majesty Smith"" and getting the power to turn anything he touches into platinum in (26) ""All That Glitters.""  Notice that Smith becomes the pivotal player in more episodes at the end of the season.

This is not to suggest there are not some solid episodes after the first five.  The first season offered several episodes that played on classic science fiction films.  The show's only two-part episode, (16-17) ""The Keeper,"" had guest star Michael Rennie as the title character in a memorable performance. Rennie played Klatuu, the strange visitor from another planet in the science fiction classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" When I first saw these episodes way back when I had not yet seen that film, but Rennie brings the same sense of intelligence and dignity to this role, which makes it the standout performance in the history of the series.  In (20) ""War of the Robots"" the Robot has to save the Robinsons from Robotoid, played by Robbie the Robot of ""Forbidden Planet"" fame.  No wonder the ""Lost in Space"" robot remains the coolest robot of all time for so many fans of science fiction.

The eight DVDs in this collection have the 29 episodes of the first season plus the unaired pilot.  If you are looking for extras, you are going to be disappointed, but since many fans have been waiting since childhood to see these episodes again the complaints will be minor (besides, it is not like the cast members are seeing any money off of this to encourage them to do commentary tracks, interviews or anything else).  Minor complaint: If they put the unaired pilot on the first disc instead of the last disc the two parts of ""The Keeper"" would be on the same disc.  ""No Place to Hide"" (Episode 0) is fascinating because the unaired pilot has neither the Robot nor Dr. Smith, which is a big surprise given how they become the most beloved and pivotal character (respectively) on the show there is a website that lists all of Dr. Smith's insults of the robot, from ""Adlepated Amateur"" to ""Wrong Way Computer""). At this point the show was going to be called ""Space Family Robinson,"" but the Walt Disney people would have none of that.",1114128000,37,5544,4.658811475409836
1869274,5,B00008YGRQ,"I loved Lost In Space when I was 9.  I couldn't wait for the next episode.  Neither can my youngest girls who are 8 and 10.  My 7 older children never got to see it, so it's past their imaginations.  If the first time you've ever seen the shows, yea..they are campy and can be picked apart.  It's mostly a new thing, with no cussing, nudity, or anything horrible that young children can't see.  It's a memory thing for adults who watched as a child.  We NEED more shows like this for our young children.  Instead of the shows with PG ratings that toddlers and young children can watch on any channel they can find.

I won't go on and on anymore.  It's clean tv viewing, and it's not all about the adults, it's alot about our children. They are the ones with the good imagination, if the parent don't sit there and put down the show.  Just sit and watch your child...you'll be surprise and how they think it is all real.

1869277,3,B00008YGRQ,"The First Season of LIS is arguably its best, with more focus on sci-fi themes, and generally more serious in its approach. Even the Black and white film gave it a real sci-fi atmosphere.  The Season 1 box set is normally pretty hefty in price (in Australia too), so its recent short term price drop on Amazon was just too good to refuse.  I snatched it up and looked forward to seeing some childhood memories.

I must admit, there are quite a number of dull and uninteresting episodes on Season 1.  One episode which comes to mind is OASIS where nothing seems to happens.  However, even with these dull episodes, it is worth owning and just watching one episode now and again. Watching more than two in a row is a chore!  Season 1 comes with two interesting special features including the unaired pilot.  This was a thrill to watch, even the opening titles were different to Season 1 episodes.  In addition, the music was more eery and dark (perfect for sci-fi).  The second special feature is the marketing pitch which was sent to networks to consider.  There are no other extras, which is a pity considering the stuff that is out there (eg. the special called ""Lost in Space Forever""). While no longer at the cheaper price at Amazon, this box set is worth adding to your collection, particularly because it includes the unaired pilot.  It also presents the show before it went silly in the Second Season.

Recommended for true fans.  Just be wary of some dull episodes.",1107648000,2,1472,4.615384615384615

ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!!! IT GIVES GREATER DIMENSION TO THE ALIEN PLANET THEY'RE MAROONED ON!!!
THE FOOTAGE WAS REUSED IN THE OTHER TWO SEASONS IN DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS!!!! THE COLOR FOOTAGE REVEALS THE RED ROCK ALMOST LIKE PLANET MARS!!!!

THE JUPITER2 IS ALSO THE MOST RECOGNIZED SPACESHIP EVER BUILT!!!! IT IS MEZMERIZING AND MY ALLTIME FAVORITE SPACESHIP!!!! THE ROTATING FUSION CORE POLAR LIGHTS BENEATH THE SPACESHIP AS WELL AS THE BLINKING DIME LIGHT ABOVE IS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD!!!! THIS HOLDS TRUE IN ALL THE SPACE FLIGHT SEQUENCES!!!!

A SCIENTIFIC ERROR!!!! A COMET IS COMPOSED AND ICE AND ROCK AND IS USUALLY SIGNIFIED BY A LONG TAIL!!!! IT'S COLD AND HARDLY A THREAT TO ANYTHING IN SPACE!!!!
IN ""ISLAND IN THE SKY"" JOHN ROBINSON IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT 40,000 FT. ABOVE THE UNKNOWN PLANET!!!! SHORTLY THEREAFTER 10,000 FT.!!!! HE SUPPOSED TO BE ACCELERATING TO THE PLANET'S SURFACE WITH HIS PARAJETS FAILING!!!! YET THE SCENES SHOW HIM STILL MANY MILES ABOVE THE PLANET!!!!

1869333,5,B00008YGRQ,"I was a real fan of this program as a child. To catch up with it years later was a real treat. I won't go any farther than this first season collection (and a couple of moments from season 3). The B/W coupled with the more serious approach was the charm, for me.

The prime driver of this was the family against the elements. The Swiss Family Robinson's in space.

It was having the constant thorn in their side (the more villanous version of Smith). It was the fantastic special effects of LB Abbott and Howard Lyndecker in the early episodes. God, people still have vivid, fun memories of that work !(and rightly so- the crash landing sequence, the chariot across the ocean, the giant and the jet pack sequences were and still are marvelous).

And John William's music! If you want to hear him at his best, tune into any one of these early episodes, listen and you'll learn just how effective his work can be.

The cast had much to do with what drew people to the show. Williams and Lockhart, Goddard, Mumy, Kristen and Cartwright were perfect choices. Jonathan Harris didn't realize how good he was- playing how bad he could be. He lost me when he turned the show into a comedy. As you watch the first season shows, then advance to the next two, I think you'll see what I mean.

The show seemed to blend new ideas with some of the style of the older classics. More serious science fiction people scoffed at it, at the time, but the 'anything goes' feel often yielded some interesting ideas and themes.

A particular favorite is Mr Nobody. This is nothing short of wonderful. It's pure fantasy and that was always the beauty of this show when it was at its best. Interesting to note, it was written by Jackson Gillis- who later became writer and story editor for the Colombo series. Anyone who has ever watched Colombo knows the quality of that show's writing.

This is one for the family... or one to trip down memory lane with. It's something you can pass down to your children or something that can make you feel like one again. And that's no easy feat.

1869335,5,B00008YGRQ,"Like The Andy Griffith Show from the same decade, ""Lost in Space"" was a much better program when it was in black and white.  Of course, the major change that occurred in the color episodes was the jumping on the ""Batman"" bandwagon by producer/creator Irwin Allen.  That brought about harsh criticism from the strong 1st-year fan base but that's another story.

As far as these 30 episodes, including the unaired pilot, are concerned, the show's initial season was unlike anything ever seen on television up to that point.  Featuring a cast of veteran television and movie performers, ""Lost in Space"", definitely was high on the talent roster.  Both Williams and Lockhart had a following from their respective roles in ""Zorro"" and ""Lassie"".  Billy Mumy had appeared in two classic ""Twilight Zone"" episodes while Angela Cartwright had been a pixie on ""The Danny Thomas Show"" and was also featured in a little film by the name of ""The Sound of Music"".

The show, featured a most impressive lineup of guest stars: Warren Oates (""Hello, Stranger""), Albert Salmi (""The Space Pirate""), Academy Award-winner Mercedes McCambridge (""The Space Croppers""), ""Hogan's Heroes"" star Werner Klemperer (""All That Glitters""), character acting veteran Royal Dano (""The Lost Civilization""), Torin Thatcher (""The Space Trader""). Michael Ansara, the former husband of Barbara Eden, also appeared in ""The Challenge"" with a very young Kurt Russell. Michael J. Pollard, a few years away from his Oscar-nomination in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" popped up in ""The Magic Mirror."" Michael Rennie from the classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" starred in the only two-part episode in the show's three-year run: ""The Keeper"".

Kevin Hagen, who would later star in Allen's ""Land of the Giants"" along with playing the doctor on ""Little House on the Prairie"", assays the role of a rather hairy alien that manages to ""duplicate"" Dr. Smith in ""His Majesty Smith"", one of the more amusing shows of the season.

Besides featuring impressive state-of-the art effects, ""Lost in Space"" also showcased the music of an up-and-coming composer by the name of John Williams.

The majority of the first season stories were quite strong, with great direction and engaging plots.  They ran the gamut of straight adventure to light-hearted pathos and family relationships.  Besides the episodes mentioned earlier, the best episodes featuring the principal characters include ""The Reluctant Stowaway,"" ""Island in the Sky,"" ""There Were Giants on Earth,"" ""The Hungry Sea,"" ""Wish Upon a Star,"" and two that were possibly the ""darkest"" in the show's history: ""One of Our Dogs is Missing"" and ""Follow the Leader.""

With a new version of the show looming on the horizon, one can only hope that the producers have respect for the original and try to maintain some of its integrity.",1095206400,17,2815,5.146929824561403

1869337,5,B00008YGRQ,"Great fun for the family!

 We just finished the famous Canis Lupus episode of Lost in Space. After my three year-old twins (a boy and a girl) heard the Robot pronounce the howling that Will, Penny and Dr. Smith were hearing in the distance was a canis lupus, the kids repeated ""canis lupus"" a few times among themselves, as they often do when learning a new word. After five minutes, however, their memories started playing tricks on them, as canis lupus suddenly became ""goofus toofis,"" (I'm guessing at the spelling) and has stayed goofus toofis for good.

 Also, the other night one of the twins was watching the episode about the aliens from the 5th dimension when his mom walked in. He said, ""Mom, I like the aliens soooo much, but they're kind of scary!""

 So we're getting more bonus material from these DVDs than what was originally included in the box set.",1090972800,6,866,4.627450980392157

The latest word from 20th Century Fox is that sales of the first season boxed set have been good but not great.  Consequently they are considering releasing the second season in two parts (15 episodes each), hoping that the lower price of each package will be more appealing to DVD buyers.

1869378,5,B00008YGRQ,"I was close to 12 years old when the show came on the air.  My parents subscribed to ""TV Guide"", so I remember being excited reading about LIS in the 1965 fall season preview issue. I remember watching that first episode, ""Reluctant Stowaway"" on our black and white big screen RCA TV.  I was enthralled with the glowing Jupiter 2 taking off, the menacing Robot, the villainous Dr. Smith, the family in silver space suits floating in zero gravity and Prof. Robinson's space walk.  As the series progressed, we were treated to a variety of alien visitors, monsters, disasters, predicaments and Dr. Smith's scheming to find a way back to Earth.  LIS on DVD brings richness to the dramatic musical score and sharpness to each scene.  The soundtrack is so clear on DVD that I actually can hear Bob May's feet shuffling as the Robot enters the Keeper's spaceship.  My favorite episodes have been ""Reluctant Stowaway"", ""The Magic Mirror"", ""Return from Outer Space"" and ""Follow the Leader"".  I love how the lead-in for the second season premier episode ""Blast off into Space"" follows the end of ""Follow the Leader"" (as the video version had also done).  The transition from black and white to brilliant color is wonderful.  I can't wait for the second season to be available on DVD.",1086480000,4,1274,4.780821917808219
1869379,5,B00008YGRQ,"I recently got the Lost In Space First Season DVD set and I'm impressed.  I watched this show when I was a kid and it still holds the same imagination and wonder it did all those years ago. This show has all the essential elements: adventure, excitement, and DANGER WILL ROBINSON DANGER!  The struggles the Robinson Family go through to survive make this show a great blend of Robinson Caruso, and sci-fi.  The adventure starts on October 16th 1997 and never stops!  The evil Doctor Zachary Smith working for a foreign power attempts to sabotage the Jupiter Mission.  The ship carrying the Robinson Family and their pilot Major Don West were bound for the planet Alpha Centauri.  Their mission was to colonize that planet and pave the way for more missions to help relieve the population problem on the Earth.  Dr. Smith's presence on the ship and his tampering of the B-9 Environmental Control Robot caused the Jupiter 2 to sustain heavy damage and be knocked off course.  The Robinson's mission became one of survival in a strange alien world as well as battling Dr. Smith who's numerous attempts to destory the Robinsons complicate matters further.  This show is visually awesome, especially for the 60's. This series predates Star Trek.  As a matter of fact CBS rejected the Star Trek pilot because they had Lost In Space.  The character interactions were a source of strength on this show.  The dialogue between Smith, West, Will and the Robot are extremely entertaining.  I especially like the dialogue between Will Robinson and John Robinson.  That father and son interaction was one of the reasons this show did and continues to appeal to people of all ages.

1869416,5,B00008YGRQ,"It is hard not to wax poetic about LIS. What makes it so great?
I think that Star Trek, The Avengers, The Prisoner and Dr. Who all share something with Lost in Space and that is a sense of television as theater. These are all minimalist-staged theater dramas where the characters are archetypes.
We even see this genius in THE OFFICE today. Less is more. When we see films that are overproduced and TV shows that look like commercials they leave us feeling less magic and even less alive.

I used to watch it in reruns after school on a tv station that was just far enough away that the picture was usually very snowy and sometimes wouldn't come in at all (bummer!)
I dreamed of having the Jupiter II and all involved for my very own. Finally, 40 years later, I do.
Granted, some of the magic is gone. Most of the special effects are pretty lame by today's standards, and the monsters are about as scary as a stuffed teddy bear.

Admittedly, the production values of the DVD boxed set itself are quite high.  It's a well-made and attractive set.  But the show itself is nearly unwatchable.

1869425,5,B00008YGRQ,"I won't go into details as to the names of the episodes because they've already been posted.
The quality of the DVDs are great - yes, it makes alot of the ""monsters"" look hokey, but that's ok!  The show is nearly 40 years old, after all.  One monster looks like someone threw a few Hefty bags over him and put some air in it and I swear, I can almost make out a zipper in another ""monster"", etc.  But I still loved all of it!
The 1st season was shot in Black & White except for the last 5 mins or so of the last (29th) episode.  It's kind of a shock to have watched so many episodes in B&W and then suddenly it's in color.  I had always wondered about the cliff-hanger end of each episode - now I know it was that it was basically cut from the next week's episode then edited to add it to the end of the current week's show.
One thing that is interesting is the Unaired Pilot.  There is no Dr Smith (Jonathan Harris) or the Robot.  Instead of Dr Smith's added weight throwing the ship off course, the ship was hit by an asteroid belt and went off course.
Another difference was when they landed on the new planet, they ""domesticated a few animals and set up a little farm"", according to the over-air narration by Guy Williams' character, John Robinson.  Otherwise, the spirit of the pilot is the same - they had to move south due to the severe weather change about to occur and they run into the huge monsters with big feet and one eye, plus tidal waves and an Earthquake.  (Yes, this sounds like Irwin Allen!)
I always wondered how old the kids were and I found out while watching the unaired Pilot - Judy is 19 (""and heroically postponing a career in musical comedy to go into space""  - yes, I'm quoting from the show!), Penny is 11 (with a 147 IQ and a hobby of zoology) and Will is 9 (having just graduated from a school of science, the youngest person to do so).
Also in the unaired pilot, Don actually kissed Judy - but, it was just on the hand.  Penny pointed this out to her parents, who said they could hardly ask Judy to ""play the field"".  The episode ends with John Robinson doing a voice-over, saying ""We have a feeling there are wonderful adventures just ahead"" and nearby 2 aliens are watching them.
It's kind of freaky to see the dates on the show - the family went into space in 1997 and were on the planet beginning in 2000.  You see John Robinson's journal, (with beautiful, feminine handwriting), with dates, such as December 3, 2001.  It's so strange to think we've already passed that date and are nowhere near ready to send a family into space.
At the very end of Disc 8, there is ""CBS Network Preview"" - a 5 minute show that CBS did for their affiliates.  There are clips of the show, with narration throughout.  Each actor is mentioned, along with previous roles and the role they will play on the show.  At the end, the narrator talks about how 20th Century Fox is solidly behind the show and ""We at CBS feel this is one show that will take off from the pack... we are sold on Lost in Space because we know it can sell for you.""
There are subtitles and Spanish options too.  I played around with it, choosing Spanish language with English subtitles.  It was funny, especially when the Robot says, ""Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!"" in Spanish.
One other note that I just realized - the aired pilot indicated the Family would be in space for 5.5 years before reaching Alpha Centauri but the unaired pilot said it would be 98 years (although the Family wouldn't age due to the freezing process).  Also, the name of the ship was changed to Jupiter 2.
In closing, I would definitely buy this DVD again although I wish there had been more Extras - I would have loved it if the surviving actors/actresses had done a few narrations about what it was like to film the show.  Hopefully this set will sell alot of copies so another season will be issued - perhaps with participation by the stars of the show.

Strange how a 39 year old show continues to hold me enthralled with each viewing. The still impressive special effects, John William's evocative music scores and (at least for the first season)above par writing all contribute to the series' longevity. What makes Lost in Space relevant for me and, I suspect, other viewers is the wonderful sense of love and family that permeates this program. I'm looking forward to the next two seasons, but for clarity of vision, season one of Lost in Space tops them all; it truly is a black and white oasis that will always have a place in my collection.",1077753600,2,745,4.609022556390977

When the Keeper's ""animals"" are escaping from his ship, you can catch a glimpse of the pony that appears earlier in the episode. This occurs after a reaction shot of Smith and the robot. It looks as though the camera tilted up after the pony pass to include a shot of more monsters (or perhaps the same ones again) exiting the Keeper's ship.

1869480,5,B00008YGRQ,"Lost in Space has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a child.  Granted, Jonathan Harris is often over the top and the plots were sometimes ridiculous, but as a young boy I was captivated.
However, since buying this set my love of the series has grown even more.  My five-year old daughter loves this show, and it is one of the few shows we can both really enjoy.  The lessons the program attempted to stress, at least during year one:togetherness, rejection of greed and laziness, and most of all family...resonate today just as it did in the early '60's.

1869481,5,B00008YGRQ,"Hi, guys, excuse my bad english, but I have to say something here.
  Lost in Space is not only an inspired and touching space odyssey. It's a masterpiece, a unique work of a genius called Irwin Allen; a TV show that will probably never be equalized.
  It's not difficult to make a pretentious and ""serious"" sci-fi show like Star Trek, any cinema student could make it. But you need much more than that to create anthologycal pieces like Lost in Space (or even Star Wars), with the right doses of humor and absurd.
  LIS is not only for children, but for everyone with an open mind. It happens in outer space, but talks to something inside of us, cause the characters are so convincingly human.
  Thank you, Mr. Irwin, for taking my childhood through fantastic worlds and beings. And, most of all, for making me feel like a child facing the universe, even when I'm 45 years old.",1077062400,8,877,4.506329113924051
1869482,5,B00008YGRQ,"What a joy!  I first watched Lost in Space as a thirteen-year-old, and later caught it in syndication when I was in high school.  From today's perspective, there were several things that stood out, that would have been lost on me as a child.  For pure entertainment value, watch the bickering relationship that sometime developed between Dr. John Robinson and Don West.  I got a kick out of two men arguing about who's in charge.  Also, Maureen Robinson certainly does not act like a 50's woman.  (""We have no business landing on that planet, John!"")  June Lockhart's portrayal certainly is a harbinger of the women's movement.  Also it amuses me to see Will get in trouble 4 times in the first 4 episodes.  Well, enough quantifying, but let's not forget Jonathan Harris' extremely literate performance.  He is a gem.  And to hear the robot's voice, and all of his internal circuitry clicking, is to re-live a wonderful auditory memory of long ago.
As for the DVD, it looked OK on my HDTV.  I am new to the format of high-definition television, but I am guessing that Fox could have done a better job.  I won't complain though.
I would like to show this series to my nieces and nephews, that is, if they could pry it away from my hands.... fat chance!
Would definitely give this my highest recommendation.",1076889600,4,1305,4.646288209606987

As a young boy I would race home from school everyday to watch it. Thanks to the magic of DVD, I can watch the first season of ""Lost in Space"" when ever I want. The first season box set is well done and it includes the (unaired pilot) as well. The picture and sound are about as crisp and clear as they can be for a show this old, much better than I can remember seeing on television. The disc packaging and artwork are fantastic to say the least. The 28 season one episodes and unaired pilot are spread out over 8 single sided disc's and they come in their own individual slim cases for storage. I hope that this set is well received by ""Lost in Space"" fans, so we can get the remaining seasons two and three as soon as possible to complete the series. With the great quality of this set and Amazon's price you can't go wrong with season one of ""Lost in Space"". I hope one day that Irwin Allen's ""Time Tunnel"", ""Land of the Giants"" and ""Voyage to the bottom of the Sea"" will eventually make it to DVD.

1869484,4,B00008YGRQ,"While I'm glad to finally see Lost In Space out in the DVD format, I'm disappointed in the quality of the set.
It is glaringly obvious that the no effort was made by Fox to digitally remaster the episodes from the original 35mm films for DVD presentation. They simply digitized the same source material that has been used to create the previous VHS and Laserdisc releases. And the DVD mastering house, DVCC, didn't make any efforts to clean things up either.
Another person here observed the gray bar running down the right side of the episode ""The Derelict"". This is the result of the episode being transferred off frame - the image was shifted to the left during transfer. A major quality control failure on the the part of DVCC.
While I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy the set, since there's no guarantee it will ever be done again, I would encourage anyone who is disappointed with the transfer quality to e-mail FOX and register your displeasure with them over the quality of the mastering done.  Had these episodes been digitally remastered from the original prints, as they should have been, everyone would have been stunned at how much better these episodes would have looked.
All we can do is hope that if enough feedback is given FOX will consider digitally remastering Lost In Space and give it the presentation it deserves.",1076112000,9,1335,4.7296137339055795
1869485,5,B00008YGRQ,"I haven't seen Lost In Space uncut since the early 80's.  It hasn't lost it's appeal to me.  It is well worth the money.  Considering that the show was made in the mid 60's it has some good special effects.  You can see the ""metors"" bounce off of the Jupiter 2.  Also the famous plastic wrap makes it apperance in the Invaders from the 5th Dimension.  It looks really cool how it shimmers and ripples under the lights.
The DVD quality is very good, mine has a bit of a hiccup during the first few seconds of Island In The Sky.
During the first couple of episodes I have wondered why they didn't push Dr. Smith into the airlock and ""space him"".
However Dr. Smith and The Robots addition makes the reason why they went off course much more believable than the Bonus Pilot ""No Where To Hide"" when the Gemmi 12 encountered a circular metor storm and they couldn't alter the course fast enough to avoid it.
I see that the second season will released later this year.  I can't wait for the second and third seasons.",1076025600,2,1009,4.335106382978723
1869496,5,B00008YGRQ,"""Lost in Space"" began as a serious science fiction adventure series about a family of space travelers who becomes marooned on an unknown planet thanks to the wreckless efforts of stowaway Dr. Zachary Smith who programmed the environmental control robot to destroy the Jupiter 2. This first season shows some of the very best episodes of the series. It also includes the unaired pilot ""No Place to Hide"" as well as the promo for the network.
""Lost in Space"" has always been my favorite space program even today. It has comedy, adventure, family values, and is enjoyable for the entire family.
Yes, the show became terribly campy in its second and third seasons but even in the camp, there are some good stories hidden in the plots.
The DVD set itself is outstanding. It has a handsome case, each disk case containing a picture of a cast member as well as a color coded disk. I found no problems in video or audio while viewing the episodes and I also was glad to be able to watch these shows completely unedited.
As a side note, the last episode has a trailer for the first color episode which is the first episode in season 2. Hopefully it will wet people's appetite for more episodes. I understand that seasons 2 and 3 will be available soon.
I am very pleased that ""Lost in Space"" is available on DVD and I certainly hope to see more shows with good morals and family values coming to DVD to keep for a very long time.",1076025600,5,1420,4.4653846153846155

Priorities have changed,,and i don't think writters of today could accomplish anything without adding in the following  crap todays show are made of: Sex, Violence, product placement,
beautifull bodies with a lack of brains,and super hyper commercials distracting you every 8 minutes....

Some of the tapes I've been watching were actually recorded from cable. Many missing scenes. The DVD quality is great, clean video, and in (((STEREO))).  It would be nice if they would include more ""bonus"" footage in the next releases but the way the Sci-Fi Channel was editing the episodes for commercials, it is like watching extra footage anyways. Please bring out the rest of the series!!! And, to the people that watched this when it originally aired, try turning off the color on your television, for season two and three, when you first watch them.

Around that time I moved to Puerto Rico and wondered if I'd ever see it again.  To my surprise, it soon arrived in Puerto Rico -- dubbed in Spanish.  So, it was an added bonus to me that this DVD collection also has the Spanish dubbing of each Season 1 episode.  Believe me, not much was lost in the translation.  Still, nothing compares to hearing Dr. Smith in his native English.  For those who like ""special features"", this DVD may come as a disappointment since it only has two (the unaired pilot and a featurette).

1869500,5,B00008YGRQ,"It may surprise many LOST IN SPACE fans to learn that the new LIS DVD set was not digitally remastered.  LOST IN SPACE was originally shot and edited on 35mm negative film.  Fox printed fine grain 35mm master positives for each black and white episode and color reversal intermediates for each color episode.  That way they never have to touch their masters and risk damaging them.  The 35mm positives were used to make the 16mm internegatives from which copies for the syndication episodes were originally struck.  Fox stopped making and distributing these 16mm prints in 1992.  But in the late 1980s Fox remastered all LIS episodes to one-inch videotape.  These tapes served as the basis for virtually all LIS episodes seen since.  They were used by the Sc-Fi Channel and also by Columbia House when they distributed the series on VHS in the mid 1990s.  The Japanese laser discs were also made from these one-inch master tapes.  When improvements in film-to-tape transfer technology were developed in recent years, a few episodes, around 8 or 9 I think, were remastered and released by Fox in the late 1990s on VHS.  Sadly, however, these ""DigiBeta"" transfers were not used in preparing the DVD set.  The DVDs were mastered from the one-inch transfers made in the late 1980s.  They certainly look better than the laserdiscs, but the source is the same--one-inch videotape.  We can only hope that Fox does digital transfers for seasons two and three and at some point goes back and remasters season one.  I wouldn't put it past Fox to release all three seasons off the one-inch tapes, then a few years down the line remaster the whole series digitally (which is what they should have done in the first place) and release it again in three boxed sets just to gouge our wallets.  In any event, enjoy these episodes.  Season two is scheduled for July and season three should be out in January, 2005.",1075507200,20,1897,4.787692307692308

1869504,5,B00008YGRQ,I just purchased season 1 and it is a great picture and brings back memories. If they could have all 3 seasons out this year that would be great. I really like the songs played throughout the episodes. Some of the songs are common on almost all the episodes but every now an episode has a song only heard on that 1 episode. I will say that the derelict spaceship on episode 2 is the same looking spaceship as on episode 62(kidnapped in space).The spaceship on kidnapped in space that houses the time androids looks like it may be the same ship as on episode 2. Overall season 1 is the best and seasons 2 and 3 are about equal but they are still plenty good for me to want all 3 seasons on dvd. KEEP THEM COMING.,1075161600,2,711,4.159420289855072

This show had so many elements that made it unique from all the other shows of that time period.  You could identify with the family, Guy Williams and Mark Goddard are super actors who have never gotten the credit they deserve, the Jupiter two set, the nifty costumes, the robot not to mention the gorgeous Marta Kristen and cute Angela Cartwright.  There was drama, comedy, action, adventure, special effects, moral lessons, the music was wonderful, the chariot was cool...I could go on and on.  Finally, on DVD, Lost in Space will be viewed by me and my family over and over again.  My hats off to Fox, Kevin Burns and Bill Mumy for preserving this classic show in a format that will out-live us all.  I hope thay can find the bloopers!  Somebody (maybe the show's editor) took them home after the wrap parties and kept them in a closet all these years.  Jonathan Harris would be proud that the show lives on and I hope Guy Williams is looking down from the heavens with a wink in his eye and is finally realizing how much everyone admired his work on Lost in Space.

1869526,5,B00008YGRQ,"I'm pleased to see this title doing well in Amazon's sales ranking, but I do wish more care had been taken with it. For a DVD title I found the picture quality disappointing - poorer than the quality of VHS tapes. The picture has a slightly dusty, gritty feel, which gives the impression of a low-resolution TV image (I see cleaner detail on VHS tapes). In addition, some lateral movement of the camera results in a small but intrusive ""jitter"" of the image on-screen.
At first I put these flaws down to the fact that I was watching a region 1 DVD on a multi-region European player through a PAL TV pretending to be NTSC. After I played a couple of the DVDs on a new PC I found it to be exactly the same. Possibly this is the result of the very modest price for an eight DVD collection. If so, I would have been happier paying a bit more to avoid the problem. It would be interesting to see if anyone else has noticed this. Perhaps I have just been unlucky with my set.
Like some other reviewers, I thought there had been some minor cuts. I can't think of any excuse for it other than a flawed master copy. I find it hard to believe it was intentional.
These cautions aside, it is marvellous to have season one in a format that does not leave me in dread of it developing tramlines over repeated viewings. The entire first season, and the unaired pilot in a box set at this price is a bargain in anyone's currency.
Lost in Space was always a show that tended to polarise opinion (people either loved it or loathed it) and I have loved it since I was a child in the 1960s. I am bored senseless with the smug, knowing, disdainful attitude of people who find the values celebrated in this show incomprehensible. The world its critics enjoy seems measurably worse to me.
The season one collection is an opportunity for anyone who was touched by the magic, humour, personality, and sheer rightness of Lost in Space. It was one of those wonderful moments in television when a show's cast and crew produced something greater than the sum of its parts. This DVD collection is a chance for us all to preserve and enjoy it again.",1074902400,7,2119,4.367088607594937
1869527,4,B00008YGRQ,"So as not to repeat what a lot of the other reviewers have said I will just pass comment on what has distressed me most about this release - the bits someone cut out!
On the original master tape containing the the last episode of the season (Follow The Leader) the producers finished the episode with a cliffhanger for an earlier episode (Attack of the Monster Plants) which was to be repeated the following week.  On this version of 'Follow the Leader,' at the end of the episode as John and Will walk off screen the image fades to black and the sound is poorly faded out.  We then get the cliffhanger from the end of the last episode of season two (The Galaxy Gift) which featured a cliffhanger for the first episode of season two (Blast Off Into Space ) which I assume would have meant a repeat of the first episode of season two the following week.
I cannot believe that somebody in charge took the decision to do this!  One of the best things about buying something on DVD or VHS (or it should be) is to see it un-cut.
This edit completely ruins the mood and look of the end of the final episode.  The jump from black and white to colour is very jarring but, ultimately, its that some bubble headed booby thought that it would be a good thing.
Will we get a 60 second teaser for the season three opener at the end of 'The Galaxy Gift' instead of its original cliffhanger ending?  What about the last episode of season three, a trailer for the Lost In Space movie?
A reviewer here posted that 'Return From Outer Space' had a very minor cut.  I have just counted two minor cuts in 'The Keeper Part Two.'  At about seventeen minutes into the episode the Keeper gives Dr Smith a small ball to keep him safe from the animals.  In a close up shot of the Keeper we see him about to turn around and walk away.  The next shot cuts to a close up of Dr Smith holding the ball in his hand and the incidental music jumps in awkwardly.  A two to three second shot has been removed.  After the Keeper motions to turn away we should cut to a two shot where we see the Keeper exit the screen as the camera moves in for a close up on Dr Smith as the music starts.
At about thirty minutes into the episode we see Maureen walk up the ramp of the Keepers' ship.  The music jumps awkwardly as she enters the ship.  The next shot features her walking into shot as she sees the Keeper unconscious on the floor of his ship.  On the version I have of that scene (taped from Channel 4 in the UK), after Maureen walks up the ramp and enters the ship we get a static shot of the Keeper unconscious on the floor of his ship.  It is a good three to four seconds before Maureen walks into shot to find him.
I had not seen 'The Keeper' for many years before watching this version but, the cuts were obvious enough for me to dig out my old tapes and check.
I would love to know why these cuts were made.  If the episodes used for this DVD release were from late eighties transfers, perhaps it was done to cut the episodes run time down by mere seconds (why bother with just a few seconds?) so more adverts could be crammed into the time slot.
Although Channel 4 cut one scene from 'The Derelict' and went straight into the credits just before the cliffhanger freeze frame for most of the season one episodes, they did a cracking job in comparison to this official offering from Fox who should have done a lot better.
I am sure that some of you may think my complaints silly but for me this was a chance to see and own Lost In Space uncut and on a format that would not deteriorate after repeated viewings.  Sadly, this has not happened here.  I can forgive the poor packaging (the front of the box looks fine but the colours and style used on the back and on the individual disk covers fails to retain the feel of the show.  The pictures of the cast on each cover are the same ones used on the front of the box - just blown up (and it shows)), the static menus (you get used to them but an animated menu would have been nice) and the lack of any extras that required to much effort to produce (we have The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen and the extras on Lost In Space Forever to watch) but not the cuts and editing, however minor they might appear.
If anyone from Fox is reading this, please, please, PLEASE do not tamper with the episodes themselves otherwise, we might as well buy a load of blank tapes and record them off the TV.
More cuts...
The War of the Robots: Dr Smith drops Maureen's watch to the ground.  The music jumps in awkwardly and we cut to a split second shot of Dr Smiths boot standing on the watch.  We should see the watch laying on the ground just before Dr Smiths boot comes into shot to crush it.  Only a cut of about one to two seconds but just enough to be noticeable.",1074902400,6,4766,4.180131004366812
1869528,5,B00008YGRQ,"I recently purchased this set and viewed several episodes. This series was a childhood favorite of mine and, I must say, the first season holds up well. Some of the dialogue (and humor) actually works better from an adult perspective.

I agree with those who say the first season of the series was the best. The black-and-white photography enhances the sense of mystery and unknown that the space travelers faced in the first year. The thoughtful writing also consistently created intrigue and excitement. The incidental music, written by John Williams of Star Wars fame, is terrific. It expresses many different moods vividly, and is one big reason for the first season's rewatchability.

Some episodes are better than others and there is a little foreshadowing, here and there, of the goofiness that followed in subsequent years. Nevertheless, the first season of the series, as presented on this DVD, is good stuff and still captures the imagination after all these years.",1074902400,3,975,5.1257861635220126

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For anyone who remembers and liked LIS, you must buy this Season 1 set. NOW.
All 29 episodes in glorious black & white. No commercials. And you can do something now that you couldn't do in 1965...when the teaser says ""...to be continued NEXT WEEK same time same channel"", you can FF right to it.
This set is very user friendly. Not many extras but I don't care. I can finally see a show that I haven't seen for maybe 30 years.
Season 1 was the best of the three seasons, IMO. Seasons 2 & 3 suffered from excess campiness and too many lame guest stars (due to the copycat phenomenon in the wake of ""Batman""). But I will still buy them, if they are released on DVD.
And to the folks at TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT a big Thank You for this wonderful set. And, as I said above, if you release Seasons 2 & 3 then I will buy them. IMMEDIATELY.",1074902400,2,1307,4.317073170731708

1869533,5,B00008YGRQ,"There was a day when any discussion of Lost In Space always brought an inevitable comparison to televisions Star Trek from the same period. And for fans of Lost In Space, the comparison was always unwelcome: nearly everyone used to say Star Trek was high-minded and serious, closer to real scifi, while Lost In Space was viewed nearly universally as patently silly space opera.
Two things have happened in the inetervening years to redeem the series rep to an unforeseeable degree. For one, Star Wars has undoubtedly lent a kind of legitimacy to the entire space opera branch of scifi (or scifi entertainment and film at any rate). I know this development upsets diehard scifi purists, but it can't really be denied. Ask most people what scifi is, and they'll candidly offer ""Star Wars, of course."" Secondly, the Star Trek episodes, so long held as the Holy Grail and template of all serious scifi television, have attained an edge of camp that makes them at least borderline unwatchable for a lot of people. For these people --and I will confess to being one of them-- the presumed ""seriousness"" or ""high-mindedness"" of the series actually works against it, heightening the camp feeling of the old show.
Lost In Space does have some funny/incongruous scenes, as in the unaired pilot when Maureen is seen taking laundry out of an atomic washing machine and carrying it to the atomic dryer in a metallic clothes basket. But the series was about a family trying to maintain a normal domestic picture, in the depths of space. Are such scenes really any funnier or more improbable than those of the Enterprise's sleek-haired captain romancing a scantily clad babe in every port in the Galaxy, and dumping her once she doesn't fit in with his plan, week after week?
I leave that to you. But for me, Lost In Space feels better and better, like more of an achievement, given the reqirements of commercial television of the time. Perhaps the fact that it has been an underdog (however fondly remembered) for such a long time makes us willing to look at it a little more generously than ever before. Reappraisal time is at hand.",1074470400,14,2119,4.776566757493188

And what more could a viewer ask for than having the former Zorro and the former Timmy's Mom running around in tinfoil space suits? Okay, add a handsome spaceship pilot, three lovable kids, a comical villain, and a robot that looks like a washing machine.
Oh, and let's not forget an alien monkey with big ears named Debbie.
All this adds up to great fun and old-fashioned cliffhanger excitement in each episode. For the most part, the picture quality is sharp and clear and the sound is excellent. It's just too bad that the first season was shot in black and white and not out-of-this-world bright Sixties color like Star Trek and Batman. But never fear, the other two seasons were in color and will probably be coming to your TV screen in the near future.

1869557,5,B00008YGRQ,"I am a lifelong Lost in Space Fan of the Classic Television series who, like many reviewers here, grew up loving this show in the 1960s. In my opinion, this DVD box set in an excellent value for the money, and I recommend it for all LIS fans (even if you already own all the Columbia House LIS Videos like I do) as well as anyone into Science Fiction. There are 8 DVDs in the set that span the entire first television season of Lost in Space. Each individual DVD Jacket has a very nicely done portrait of each member of the Robinson family, including Robot B9. The entire box set measures just a little over 2 inches thick, so (if you are like me) you can take it with you on vacation as it tucks away nicely into a laptop PC carrying case!
The theme of this box set focuses on the episodes themselves. If you are interested in behind the scenes stuff or the making of Lost in Space, I recommend you also purchase the ""Lost in Space Forever"" DVD which makes for a nice companion to the box set.
In my opinion, the picture quality of the box set is very good and is equivalent to broadcast television and good VHS; however, according to [...] these DVDs WERE NOT ""digitally remastered"" from the original fine grain 35mm negative film...they were instead generated from the 1"" analog video tape masters that were created in the late 1980s. The 1"" analog video tape masters have been used as the baseline for all Lost in Space broadcasts and VHS tapes since the late 80s and was the best mastering technology of that timeframe, but it would be nice if sometime in the future, Fox could follow up with a special ""digitally remastered DVD edition"" using the latest digital remastering technology to provide a superior picture quality over broadcast television and VHS tape.
I am hoping that the DVD box set sells well, and that Fox will follow up with the Second and Third seasons of Lost in Space on DVD. While some LIS fans feel that the first season was the best, I regularly watch and enjoy very much the second and third seasons from my Lost in Space Columbia House VHS collection, and would definitely buy DVD editions of the second and third seasons.",1074211200,5,2152,4.450632911392405

1869559,5,B00008YGRQ,"In 1965, U.S. television viewers were treated to a new Irwin Allen sci-fi production entitled ""Lost In Space"".  Irwin Allen took his inspiration from the 1960 Disney Studios film ""Swiss Family Robinson"", which was based upon the 1812 children's novel ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" written by Johann David Wyss (1743-1818) and edited by his son Johann Rudolf Wyss (1781-1830), who also composed the Swiss National Anthem.  Johann David Wyss based his book upon the 1719 classic novel ""Robinson Crusoe"" by Daniel Defoe (1660-1731).  However, Irwin Allen was not the first man to transplant the Robinson family from a desert island to outer space.  That credit goes to Gold Key Comics who introduced their ""Space Family Robinson"" comic book in 1962, but the Robinson family in the comic differed considerably from Irwin Allen's TV show.  (Before its TV debut, the first working title for ""Lost In Space"" had been ""Space Family Robinson"".)  Since Gold Key Comics had working relationships with several TV producers, they didn't sue Irwin Allen.  Instead, they modified the name of their comic book in 1966 to ""Space Family Robinson Lost In Space"", which was in print through 1969, and licensed two other Irwin Allen productions.
Irwin Allen's Robinson family had five members: Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams, 1924-1989), Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart), Judy Robinson (Marta Kristen), Will Robinson (Billy Mummy, who later played Lennier in the 1994-1998 sci-fi TV series ""Babylon 5"") and Penny Robinson (Angela Cartwright, who had previously played the daughter Brigitta in the 1965 ""The Sound of Music"").  To assist piloting their spaceship, a flying saucer called the Jupter-2, they included a pilot named Maj. Donald 'Don' West (Mark Goddard) so that they could colonize a planet located in the Alpha Centauri star system.  (Beyond the Sun, Alpha Centauri is Earth's nearest interstellar neighbor.)  They also enlisted the assistance of a robot (played by Bob May with Dick Tufeld doing the voice).  Since the journey to Alpha Centauri would take several years, everyone onboard the Jupiter-2 would be placed into suspended animation for the duration of the flight.  However, not everyone on Earth was happy with the Robinson's plans, so a clandestine plot to sabotage the ship after launch was hatched.  The would-be saboteur, Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris, 1914-2002), snuck onboard the Jupiter-2 shortly before launch and reprogrammed the robot to destroy the ship after launch, but he didn't get off before launch.  When the robot started to run amuck, he revived everyone to help stop the robot, but not before it damaged the ships navigational system, leaving everyone lost in space.
During the show's first season of 29 episodes, which were filmed in black & white, the Robinson, Maj. West, Dr. Smith and the robot encounter a myriad of aliens, monsters and alien technology ranging from the benign to the outright malicious.  Some of the first season's guest appearances include Reta Shaw (1912-1982) in episode ""Return from Outer Space"", Michael Rennie (1909-1971, who played Klaatu in the 1951 classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") in the two-part ""Keeper"" episode, Kurt Russell in episode ""The Challenge"" and Werner Klemperer (1920-2000, known for playing ""Col. Klink"" in the 1960's sitcom ""Hogan's Heroes"") in episode ""All That Glitters"".  Only the first few episodes of the first season have the Jupiter-2 in space.  After that, the rest of the season's episodes takes place upon an alien planet.  (The Jupiter-2 doesn't go back into space until the beginning of the second season.)
Overall, I rate first season of ""Lost In Space"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  Though the monsters were a bit campy in their rubber suits, the story lines for most of the episodes were quite good with only a few exceptions.  An attempt to revive the show after 30 years with the 1998 big screen film (which featured cameos of several original TV cast members) did not do well at the box office.  A later attempt to have a special reunion show was cancelled after Jonathan Harris passed away.  The best episodes of the first season include ""The Reluctant Stowaway"" (pilot), ""The Derelict"", ""Island in the Sky"", ""There Were Giants in the Earth"", ""The Hungry Sea"", ""My Friend, Mr. Nobody"", ""Invaders from the Fifth Dimension"", ""The Sky Is Falling"", ""Wish Upon a Star"", ""Attack of the Monster Plants"", ""Return from Outer Space"", ""The Keeper"", ""The Magic Mirror"", ""The Lost Civilization"" and the unaired pilot called ""No Place to Hide"".  The second season overall wasn't quite as good as the first, and the third was worse.",1074124800,10,4617,5.110372340425532
1869560,5,B00008YGRQ,"I am glad to have this opportunity to share and read opinions about the release of the DVD.

'Lost in Space' meant the world to me as a kid, and strangely, continued to obsess me into Adulthood, when others around me were heading in the opposite direction.
I kept the secret faith burning, fiercely within, gathering momentum with each passing year, now fueled by the Internet. Evidently, my secret passion is  shared all over the world.

I am a self confessed, fully -fledged, 'Lost in Space' Nut!
and am proud of it!
The release is testament to all us fans, worldwide, who have contributed in its success story ; and who are now, finally rewarded, with this glorious slice of television history.
Guy Williams and June Lockhart are superbly cast. Mark Goddard is solid from the outset, with great energy and truth in his performance.  The Family unit works perfectly and of course we all know what transpired following the huge popularity of Dr Smith and the Robot.
But for most of us, I guess it was the kids that we identified with.
 'Return from Outer Space' was my first choice to view, after ripping open the tight plastic seal of the inner box (at one point, using my teeth, I was in that much of a hurry!)
 I had very vaugue memories of it and is one of 4/5, which sadly I missed on the VCR during it's re run on Channel 4, here in the UK in 1987, so I chose it first, It was my earliest memory of Billy Mumy. He is gifted,charming actor and the shows' hero. It is a very gentle but nonetheless riveting episode , that moved me to a tear, as did ""My Friend Mr Nobody"",which I chose to watch next.
Obviously  the episode when I must have first engaged with Angela Cartwright!? I liked Penny and often hoped she would have been featured more regularly. When she was, she impressed.
Considered in order of transmission, is evidence that the quality and tone of the show initially, were indeed top knotch and the performances, although tentative at times, are immediately engaging. The exterior planet sequences are  a rare visual treat, and remind us of how  budget cut backs and network dabbling changed the look of the show. But, hey! That's television!? Lost in Space was undoubtedly at it's most innovative and exciting  in this season, but what was to follow was the BEST!
I can completely comprehend now, why I remained  gripped in its charms  for so long.
 The Jupiter 2 was the essence of security for me and the family were vital and imperative. This show literally welcomed me to 'PLaneT EaRtH' and has haunted me all my life and, almost 40 years on, it will influence a new audience, because it is a Classic.
Perhaps now, more than ever, this planet could  benefit from it's charms again.
I salute Fox.
 It has been a dream come true fro me and this product justifies the devotion and patience of the fans.  It has been worth the wait!
Seasons 2&3 are a MUST!
Lets hope that in a few 'light years' time, our next generation will be sharing their reviews of the NEW series of 'Lost in Space' (cerca 2004) the pilot of which, I understand is in production for the WB channel.
Congratualtions again, to those who made this happen.
I trust  Jonathan Harris is grinning down on us!
Long may he Sneer....and
Long live The Robinsons!""

1869561,5,B00008YGRQ,"When most people think of Lost In Space, cheesy sets and campy plots come to mind. However, this was not how the series started out. The fact that this DVD edition of the first season is in black and white ( as were the original shows) defies that presumption. The moody ""Space Noir"" cinematography of the first four episodes look fantastic on DVD. Equally intriguing is the plot driven by Dr. Smith's plans to murder the whole Robinson family in their sleep! He's creepy here, and the stark cinematography of season 1 is more reminiscent of a dark western set in space. As the season progesses you'll see Dr. Smith's character soften and become more comic relief than Noir Villain. But the first season's writers achieved a balance between goofy humor and decent sci-fi plots. Watch for the brilliant Alice In Wonderland fairy tale re-telling entitled ""Mr. Nobody"".  This is one of the best coming of age stories ever broadcast on TV! My daughter really got into it, and now I have a new generation of LIS fans running around the house yelling: ""DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!!""",1074124800,3,1078,4.764705882352941

My favorites from the first year are ""The Oasis"", Where Smith eats an alien fruit, grows to be the size of a giant, and then catches a cold. ""The Raft"" Which shows the family's struggle to survive as they build a space raft to attempt to return to earth.
The Keeper Parts 1 and 2 as well as Return from Outer Space where Will returns to Earth at christmas in the year 1998.
This is one box set that no LiS fan should be without.

1869573,5,B00008YGRQ,"I was born the year and month Lost in Space premiered so I did not get to experience it until the early 1970s.  Oh how I remember being so excited when I was a little boy because every summer Lost in Space was was rerun. I was glued to my tv set. Sure the f/x are dated and can be cheesy looking...but when I watch Lost in Space I still watch it through the eyes of a 10 year old boy.
It is so cool having it in DVD format. Although it does not have very many extras other than the unaired pilot and a presentation film to the sponsors, it is well worth the money. Most tv shows have only 22 episodes per season but back in the 60s more were produced so this collection has 29 (plus the unaired pilot). Come to think of it, LIS had 83 episodes so that would be around 4 seasons now instead of the three years it ran in the 60s. Anyhow, this dvd is well worth the purchase to this man still watching Lost in Space through the eyes of a 10 year old boy.",1073952000,4,951,3.902061855670103
1869574,5,B00008YGRQ,"Back in my younger days, I used to dream that some time in the future I would be able to obtain my very own set of un-cut LOST IN SPACE episodes to watch whenever I wanted.  Well, all these years later, the dream has finally come true.
The new DVD set of the complete first season is absolutely outstanding.  All 29 black & white episodes are here, crystal-clear and with unaltered cliffhanger endings. (Even the cliffhanger/preview for ""Blast Off into Space"", the premiere episode of the second season, is included -- in color!) The set also features the unaired pilot as well as a fascinating short promotional film that was shown to CBS executives.  As for the DVDs themselves, the discs are packaged in very slim separate plastic cases rather than one of those awkward fold-out albums, which is a major plus.
One mystery: At least one episode, ""Return From Outer Space"", is missing some brief footage.  I compared the DVD version to a tape of the episode I recorded off a local station back in 1985.  In the scene where Will grabs the bottle of carbon tetrachloride and runs out of the store, the original version shows Will bumping right into the sheriff, who says, ""Wait a minute, wait a minute...I thought I left you with Miss Ruth!"".  The DVD version, however, jumps from the storekeeper saying ""Hey, wait a minute"" to the scene outside where the sheriff is looking down at the stolen bottle.  Trivial, of course, but it makes one wonder why any parts were removed at all.
All things considered, though, this set comes as close to perfection as any fan could have hoped.  Bravo to the folks at Twentieth Century Fox for doing a superb job of preserving one of the best television series ever made.",1073952000,11,1705,4.641196013289036

1869576,4,B00008YGRQ,"The Robinson Family (Guy Williams, June Lockhart, Billy Mumy, Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen)  and Major Don West (Mark Goddard) are sent on their adventure because of concerns about over population. Their goal is to arrive at Alpha Centuri within 5 years. They'll be unaware of the passage of time as they'll be in suspended animation for the duration of the voyage and their auto pilot will steer them on their clear course.
There's one gadfly in the whole plan. Dr. Zackery Smith (Jonathan Harris)has been hired by a foreign government to sabotage the mission. He programs the Robot to go beserk 8 hours after taken off and destroy the Jupiter 2 spacecraft. Unfortunately, Smith becomes trapped on the Jupiter 2 and when the ship goes off course and arrives smack dab in the middle of a swarm of meteorites, Smith must wake up West to pilot the ship out of the bombarding chunks of rock.
Like Star Trek, Lost in Space originally was intended as a five year mission and like Star Trek it became a three year one. The shows first season has a number of stellar episodes written by some of the top television writers (some of them also science fiction writers)of their day. The pilot was originally written by Shimon Wincelberg (Star Trek)and Irwin Allen while many other episodes were written by S. Bar David (another Star Trek alum), Barney Slater, Peter Packer and Wincelberg. Directors included Nathan Juran (The 7th Voyage of Sinbad), Allen himself (only on the previously unreleased pilot episode)and other television directors of the time (including Leo Penn which, I believe, is Sean Penn's dad). The incidential music included music written for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" by Bernard Herrmann but the original theme music and music written for the first season was quite effective as well.
While the future isn't what it used to be, Lost in Space still works as fun space opera. The actors all gave solid performances with television vets Guy Williams (Zorro)and June Lockhart (Lassie)leading a great cast. While the series would later evolve into silliness, the first season had strong writing and material to work with. The first five episodes (which had elements of the original unaired pilot spread around in them)are still entertaining and can capture the imagination even if the look of the series is dated.
The picture quality varies from o.k to  exceptional. Occasionally the transfers look a bit dark (particularly during the pilot episode)but part of that could be the way the show was lit, too (my memory doesn't serve me all that well here). One of the drawbacks of the high resolution aspect of DVD is the fact that you can see the wires during the weightless sequence during the first episode ""The Reluctant Stowaway"".
It's a pity that Fox chose not to do a commentary track for the series. Bill Mumy, Marta Kristen, Angela Cartwright and Mark Goddard probably would have been up for it. I don't know that they'd remember much specific about each episode but it would have been fascintating to hear them discuss the series. There's also got to be test footage or audition footage from the series somewhere in Fox's vault. Hopefully with future releases we'll get more extras although you'll have to allow for the silly nature of parts of season 2 & 3.
Although there's no extras really mentioned on the box or the review here, the set includes the original 29 episodes on dual layered discs with the pilot as a bonus. The pilot was, of course, eventually aired on the Sci-Fi Channel during a Lost in Space marathon but like lots of folks, I missed much of it. There's also athe original ""Lost in Space"" presentation from the network executives to advertisers included on the last disc.
It's a pity that a color copy of the original pilot isn't available as it would have been nice to have as an extra on this disc as well.",1073952000,12,3851,4.798192771084337
1869577,4,B00008YGRQ,"Fans of this series about a family stranded on an alien planet, coping with a different danger each week, will love this box set.  It contains all 29 episodes of the first season (black and white) in one neat little package.
The first season started off very seriously. The spaceship hits a meteor storm, crashes on an uncharted planet (great effects), and fights to survive giant monsters, earthquakes, blistering heat waves, droughts, you name it. About halfway through the season, the Doctor Smith character (a stowaway spy) changed from dangerous to foppishly ridiculous and cowardly. The series tone became much lighter (probably CBS worried about the effect on children) but overall the first season is great.
I applaud Fox's decision not to colorize these episodes. Black and white gives them a moody atmosphere.
However, the unedited pilot WAS filmed in color. It was chopped up and spread out over the first five episodes.  The unaired pilot DID NOT INCLUDE Smith or the ever popular robot. They were added in after the pilot was included (wisely, I might add).
This package gives you the unedited pilot, but in black and white (it would have been interesting to see it in color). A ten minute CBS promo is also included but it contains just scenes from the show (the extras are disappointing).
Fox is waiting to see how this sells, then they will go foward with season 2 (which is nowhere near as good as 1).
The screen quality of this season is excellent. Crystal clear with little grain.  If you've only seen these in syndication, you'll get about 8 minutes of additional scenes per episode you haven't seen due to broadcast channels cutting out footage to add extra commercials!",1073952000,6,1691,4.864583333333333

1869580,5,B00008YGRQ,"This series is what Lost In Space is all about...survival!! The endearing aspects of the show, to me, has always been the triumphant overcoming of Professor Robinson and Don to obstacles and dangers. A good fatherly spirit and ethical attitude is portrayed nicely by Professor Robinson even as they are plunged into the unknown void, off course from reaching Alpha Centauri. As you will see the dangers they face are immediate upon their first crash landing on Preplanus and the confrontation with the Giant seen on the Episode, ""There were Giants on the Earth"". The stories in short were well written and highly imaginative. Episodes like ""Invaders From The 5th Dimension"" and ""The Keeper"" are unforgettable! The episode ""The Raft"" is the start where they attempt to derive a synthesized deutronium fuel source to leave Preplanus in the first series, we fans-true fans of the show always sat at the edge of our seats wondering ...are they going to lift off soon? Did they solve their deutronium fuel problem? This series showed very cool special effects and great acting by Guy Willaims and Mark Goddard. The first season shows the Doctor's legendary insanity and developing  humor prevelant in the 2nd series. Oh the pain....the pain. Every Lost In Space fan MUST get this DVD! This series redefined special effects at that time during the 1960's. The Jupiter 2 is delicately designed and beautifully portrayed on the Alpha Control Launch Pad! Thank God someone had the sense to design a spaceship that was unique and not just a traditional cigar shaped rocket!! The engine sound too in the episode ""The Derelict"" was the coolest sound at that time for a spaceship with an antigravity drive!! Can't wait for the 2nd season DVD release!! It is sure to be released! Enjoy!!",1073001600,10,1773,4.929765886287625
1869581,5,B00008YGRQ,"Never in the history of television did a show start out so good and end up so terrible. Lost in Space (in the second two seasons) drifted from science fiction to fantasy and silly fantasy at that with Dr. Smith (a once clever and sinister villian) turning into a bumbling idiot who is over used in each episode, to the detriment of the other characters (with the exception of Will and the robot who had also been transformed by this time from a real robot to to a being so laughable, it became embarressing). There were some notable exceptions, so yes, I will admit to a few good episodes in the second two seasons but for the most part, the show had lost its steam by then.
The good news is that Season One is wonderful, well written, well acted and not bad in the special effects department considering when the series was made (mid-sixties)The black and white helped to make things look more realistic and occassionally shots of the moving land vehicle (called the chariot) were seen against the back drop of a real desert which gave us the feel that these people really were on a remote planet somewhere.
Although Dr. Smith's silliness is established by the end of season one, the stories at least are still good and the show can still at this point be called science fiction.
Perhaps the contrast between this season and the following two make Season One a special treasure to be cherished.",1072915200,11,1395,4.561752988047809
1869582,5,B00008YGRQ,"It all depends on your point of reference, but for someone growing up in the 70's like myself, reruns of Lost in Space, and Bewitched are etched in my memory banks as fond memories.  I can remember coming home from grade school everyday, looking forward to Lost in Space on the independent tv channel, back when rooftop antennas and dial tuners were the norm.  Lost in Space captured my imagination.  I also watched the original Star Trek series, but Lost in Space had a warm and fuzzy feel to it.  I can't wait to get the DVD!",1072310400,3,527,4.402061855670103
1869613,3,B00008YGRQ,"I loved watching the weekly adventures of the Space Family Robinson.  I have the first six episodes on VHS which I found one day in a video store.  There is no question that season 1 is the best and more serious of the three seasons. and the first five or six episodes are the best of them.  One thing you should know about Irwin Allen, the producer of the series (as well as Time Tunnel, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Land of the Giants, etc.) is that he would blow about 40-50% of the series annual budget in the first few episodes of each series.  And it shows on all of his television series.  I always thought that in the first two seaons the name should have been changed to ""Stranded on a Deserted Planet"" because they weren't Lost in Space at all.  In the third season, they were truly ""Lost in Space"" and not on a deserted planet. (Yes it's true that they got off the planet at the start of season two, but they crashed on another deserted planet.  It's always easy to use the same set week in and week out)
But, as a 9 year old boy growing up in suburban Connecticut at the time, and at a time when the space race was going full throttle between the Americans and the Soviets, I found this series to be very believable as to what could happen in the future of space travel.  (After all, the fist episode takes place on October 16, 1997 more than 30 years in the future at that time).  And somehow, along with the seriousness of the first season and the black and white cinematography, it made it all the more realistic.
My only gripe with all of the Irwin Allen TV shows is that they never wrapped it up.  They are still Lost in Space, Tony and Doug are still bouncing around in Time via the Time Tunnel (talk about campy TV shows and real bad history!!!) and those earthlings are still trapped in the Land of The Giants.
Irwin Allen, who later went on to produce motion pictures such as The Poseiden Adventure and The Towering Inferno, should have taken a lesson from another TV producer - Quinn Martin.  Quinn Martin had the decency to wrap up his TV series, The Fugitive, by having Richard Kimball catch the one-armed man.  And this was done after The Fugitive was given the ax by ABC.  Martin wanted his audience satisfied and put the money out to produce a two part finale in what would have been the start of a fifth season.",1072310400,34,2343,4.273755656108597
1869614,5,B00008YGRQ,"There's a song written by Michael Nesmith (yes, one of the former television ""Pre-Fab Four"" better known as ""The Monkees"") called ""Little Bits and Pieces"".  It's about a guy who wakes up on the floor slowly remembering last night's company Christmas party.  All the embarrassing events come back to you one piece at a time.
Well that's how I feel about Lost in Space.  So much can be said about the first season.  Great hardware, music, even acting was pretty darn good.  You really felt you were out in the middle of outer space - all alone - trying to survive.  At least the first 5 episodes were like that.  After that we saw increasingly strange storylines such as the ""hillbillies in space"" episode (The Space Croppers) complete with outhouse spaceship and a whole subplot with werewolves!  What was THAT all about?
It was at this point, as a child, I was banned to a bedroom with a black and white television and told to watch the show alone.  My parents found something else to watch on Wednesday nights!
One CAN say the episodes are uneven - for every ""Space Croppers"" there's a ""My Friend, Mr. Nobody"", the ugly duckling turned swan episode with some of the best episodic music ever written for television (IMHO).  So as you ply through this set you'll anxiously ""spin"" the next episode, but suddenly see some ridiculous storyline.  Ah - fast forward to the NEXT episode!
A sure reason to purchase the 1st Season set is the included unaired pilot ""No Place to Hide"".  Fans will swear they've seen this material before and they would be right as this episode was cut up and spread out over five different broadcast LiS episodes!
Overall this season contains the best of Lost in Space.  I would skip, ""The Sky Pirate"", ""Ghost in Space"", ""The Space Croppers"" or watch with your kids - they will get a kick out of them.
Top 5 are: ""My Friend, Mr. NoBody"", ""The Keeper"", ""The Magic Mirror"", ""Follow the Leader"", and the 1965 Christmas episode, ""Return from Outer Space"".",1072224000,8,1974,4.637931034482759
1869615,5,B00008YGRQ,"I don't know the last time I was this excited about a DVD release. I like to get box sets, and high points have always included getting stuff like X-FILES and SIMPSONS.  But when I saw that LOST IN SPACE was coming out, I had a great rush of nostalgia.  I was born in 1963, and the early days of the repeats of this show were ALWAYS on in my room!  I loved this show.  I'm sure it's a terrible show in many ways, but I still remember it with the ""eyes"" of a child, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
I wish there were more bonus features promised for this set, and I'm less than thrilled that the sound is mono (not even ""virtual"" 5.1??), but I'll get over it.  I look forward to visiting my old friends Dr. Smith, Will, Robot, et al.  This will also cleanse away memories of the dull movie!

They are corney - to the extreme - the effects are left over Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (both Irwin Allen productions so you would see a monster on Voyage one week and Lost in Space the next!).  The early part of the series tried to be more serious in tone, and it dragged, but as the robot and Dr. Smith were pushed forward, the episodes became more campy and great fun!
So have a ball.  Watch out for Robbie the Robot to show up and duke it out with The Robinson ""you may call be golden boy"" Robot!

1869617,2,B00008YGRQ,"Stephen has aptly summed up the problem with Lost In Space. It WAS aimed at 8 year-olds. Those of us who were around 16 when it came out found it unsophisticated, boring, and silly fluff compared to the far more intellectually stimulating Star Trek. That's why the Lost In Space movie bombed too - it was as awful as the TV show - while Star Trek spawned a number of superb films and all manner of stellar spin-off TV series. Long live Star Trek.

Many fans wonder what it is that made this show different from Star Trek and the like.  I'll venture my opinion.  LiS was primarily about family.  Star Trek had the underlying premise that ""family"" would become obsolete, replaced by federation blah blah blah.  Well, here we are, past the 1997 ""future"" launch date of the Jupiter 2, and family is still alive.  For so many of us, family hasn't been all happy, but don't we watch Lost In Space to see them stick together as family and survive over and over and over?  And where else can you see main characters actually ""working"" in almost every episode?  Check it out.  John and Don have an at-work scene in almost every episode.  That's a healthy message that we can all feel glad that our kids are seeing.  And one more commentary, isn't Lost In Space the first ""homeschooled"" family on TV?  And Will sure got a great education.  Have fun, all.",1071792000,6,1056,4.4375
1869619,5,B00008YGRQ,"Yes, Dr. Smith quoted the Bard, almost as often as Samantha's father Maurice on Bewitched. Long live 60s TV!
But the dearly departed Jonathan Harris also ad-libbed and re-wrote many of his lines to include alliterative insults, gourmet cravings and precious gems and metals. Ah, Plat-i-num!
This was quite a revelation for a 7 year old in 1965. I've carried these things to adulthood and impressed several teachers, profs, students and employers along the way...
Beyond the wonderful camp (I learned what camp was from LIS), Lost In Space had a recurring theme that love was the most powerful force in the universe, that has also served me well with family and friends.  Who says Star Trek was more philisophical? ""Is there in Beauty, Truth"" or whatever...
Besides the great writing, music, casting and performances are the ultra-cool gadgets and vehicles like the Chariot, the Space Pod, different versions of laser guns and even IDAK (Instant Destroyer and Killer android). But there is nothing more thrilling than seeing the flying-saucer-shaped Jupiter 2 in flight, crashing or extending its landing gear.  It's simply perfect.
And the ultimate piece of machinery, the Robot. You will fall in love with this 'bubble-headed booby' and see how he became one of the most legendary characters in TV history.

1869620,5,B00008YGRQ,"One of the great things about DVD is that it gives studios a chance to package entire seasons of some of the greatest TV shows in history into a tiny little box.  This is one of those shows.
I grew up watching this show and from time to time I've talked to younger people who have never seen the show at all.  It hasn't had the kind of distribution it deserves on TV or video in quite a long time, so this could be your chance to insure that you can share this show with your children.
The show was a bit campy, but it was a lot of fun to watch.  The best way to explain it is to say that it was the typical 60's show about a family, that happened to be lost in space.  You get all the growing pains and childhood issues of a Brady Bunch episode, but with a dash of aliens dressed up like salad vegetables.

What the Trekkie above commented on earlier is typical of those who are More Sci-Fi Than Thou. Enjoy LIS for what it is.  ""Wizard of Oz"" is hardly aimed at adults and it has a large older-than-8-years following. The only question that comes to mind is--why bother to write a review on something that one obviously dislikes so.  I really admire Trek and have seen many episodes but I am hardly equipped to write anything approaching a review on it, nor will I buy any DVD's.  I'm not a fan.  Why would I waste the time.

1869622,5,B00008YGRQ,"Like most of the other reviewers, I too grew up with ""Lost in Space"" and have many fond memories of the series.  From the first season I'm greatly anticipating uncut versions of ""Island in the Sky"", ""The Hungry Sea"" and ""Follow the Leader"", three of the best episodes in my opinion.  Am also looking forward to seeing the great and underated character actor Albert Salmi as Alonzo P. Tucker, ""The Sky Pirate"".  The warm and affable Salmi was among Bill Mumy's very favorite guest stars.
The music for the four segments scored by John Williams provided a wonderful extra dimension to this show, perhaps some of the finest television music ever written. The insertion of Bernard Herrmann's music from the 20th Century Fox films ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Garden of Evil"" and ""Beneath the 12-Mile Reef"" (Prof. Robinson jet pack scenes) added immeasurably to the show's ambiance as well.
I have little doubt that the entire series will be released as there is a huge legion of fans of the series.  ""Lost in Space"" briefly flirted with the high caliber writing seen in the first season in the first half dozen episodes or so from season three, the next best season.  Who could forget ""The Condemned of Space"", ""Visit to a Hostile Planet"", ""Hunter's Moon"" and ""The Space Creature""?  The series often received a bad rap when compared to ""Star Trek"", but these episodes provided superior entertainment when compared to ""The Way to Eden"", ""Spock's Brain"" and many others from that series' final season!",1071100800,4,1496,4.847058823529411
1869653,4,B00008YGRQ,"It has become common for TV programs to be packaged on DVD by complete seasons.  To maximize sales, the focus has been mainly on programs produced in the last ten years, mostly aimed at a younger market.  Programs like The X Files, Buffy, Friends, 24, The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Alias, are just a few examples of contemporary series with most of their episodes already available on DVD.
The reasons for this emphasis are of course economic, but it is nice that the powers that be, are beginning to give some neglected classic TV programs from the 60's, similar comprehensive treatment.  Recently we have seen The Dick Van Dyke Show, and The Monkees issued in complete season sets.  Green Acres, and Gilligan's Island are also scheduled for similar release soon.  Fans of this era, hope that more of our favorites will be appearing on DVD in the near future.
Happily for the fans of Lost in Space, the wait is over, at least for season one.  Like many of Irwin Allen's TV programs, this one has a huge following of intensely dedicated fans who love following the adventures of the Robinson family and crew of the Jupiter 2.
More a fantasy adventure, than a program based on hard science, Lost in Space is escapist fun, characterized by strong family values.  Other strengths are the marvelous cast, well-defined characters with broad appeal, and those outrageous monsters and special effects.  Billy Mumy is charming as the spunky Will Robinson.  The Robot, was a groundbreaking TV character, and Jonathan Harris was fantastically unique as Dr. Smith, the man who brought the word ""ninny"" to prime time.
Because cable networks like Nick at Night, and TV Land provide so much programming from the 60's and 70's, there may be some resistance to issuing programs from this era on DVD.  If you want to see more of Lost in Space on DVD, getting this set is a must.  Supporting classic TV series in general and demonstrating profit potential, may lead to more programs from this era being released on DVD.  We can but hope.",1070150400,14,2024,4.735042735042735

  As a lifelong LISfan, all I can say is that it's about darn time. After God knows how many attempts, LIS is at long last coming to DVD.
  Fan or not, no one can deny the impact that LIS has had on pop-culture. While it may not be on the same level as Star Trek, it has not been overused like Trek has. This, I think has only served to increase the popularity over time.
  Certainly, the show has more than its share of science gaffes, but as kids we weren't really concerned with the fact that opening the outer hatch while the interior hatch was open would certainly mean immediate death while in the vacuum of outter space. Nor were we concerned with the fact unlike comets, novas don't actually travel.
  Much like Apple Jacks, we just plain liked it.
  LIS was more about the family. The theme of ordinary humans in extraordinary situations was a hit, and for what it was and still is, LIS was more than up to the task! ""Great Vegetable Rebellion"" notwithstanding, throughout all three seasons, LIS never failed to entertain in one way or another.

Almost 6 years after the Jupiter 2's 1997 launch date, and two years short of it's 40th aniversary, Lost In Space is coming to DVD.
Oh joy! Oh, rapture!
I was all of 9 years old when this show premired, and for three years, every Wensday night at 6:30 on WMT, in Cedar Rapids Iowa, I would gobble up every episode.
Fast foreward to the present.  WMT is now KGAN, and during the passage of time, Seasons 2 and 3 have lost thier appeal to me, except for one or 2 of the episodes, such as ""Visit To A Hostile Planet"". However, Year one has always held it's magic, when Doctor Smith was a truly nasty and evil villan, the show was in glorious Black and White, and it was presented in a wonderful SERIALIZED format.
(God, I hope Fox keeps those ""Teasers"" intact.)
Lost In Space Season One has always been a ""Holy Grail"" to me, ever since I started video collecting. And to hear that the unaired pilot ""No Place To Hide"" will be included makes this even more of a joy. Anyone who has seen it will know what I mean. Irwin's ORIGINAL vision for Lost In Space was far diffrent than what CBS and Fox wound up giving us. Too bad it didn't work out that way, but by far, Year One was truly the best, and the one I want to own.

I can't picture John or Maureen not having time to attend their son's science fair.  I too think the first season was the best - it was more of an ensemble piece than the Dr. Smith/Will/Robot show it later became.
Speaking of Smith, I liked him the best in the first six or seven episodes.  He was a competent scientist, able to save Maureen's life when she responded badly to the suspended animation.  It's hard to reconcile that Dr. Smith with the spineless ninny he later became in the second and third seasons.
I wonder if My Friend, Mr. Nobody, will still be my favorite?  How will the characterizations stack up in these more enlightened? times.  Maureen was a doctor of some kind but I don't remember seeing her do much of anything but housework.  Penny was cool, Judy was just there like a Barbie doll.

1869695,5,B00008YGRQ,"I was 13 when ""Lost In Space"" premiered on CBS-TV in September 1965. The premise of the show was one that appealed to me, especially as a devoted watcher of NASA and the '60's space race to the moon. Although I had outgrown the show a bit by the end of its third season because of what the show had morphed into, I was a faithful watcher until the end.
The first season of the three has always been my favorite. A bit of humor (which became over-balanced a bit in seasons #2 & #3), but not too much, with stories that didn't insult the intelligence of its viewers and gave us a lot of ""life lessons"" in the story lines about family, loyalty, honesty, and consequences for actions- good and bad. The cast? Guy Williams, June Lockhart, Mark Goddard, Marta Kristen, Angela Cartwright, Billy Mumy, Jonathan Harris- and the robot! Perfect, perfect, perfect for their respective roles and a chemistry as an ensemble that is matched in few other television shows.
LIS produced a few trends in television that continue today. Most notably, I believe, this was prime-time's first ""soap opera"" as the story lines in seasons #1 and #2 continued through the episodes with ""cliff-hanger"" endings each week. They were not ""closed-ended"" stories as became the case in season #3. Season #1 stayed truer to classic science-fiction of the time instead of science-fantasy, which what season #2 was. The two music themes (especially for season #3) and background music in the episodes (Can you get better than John Williams??) was vastly far ahead of its time and given a great deal of fore-thought in its quality- not ""jingle"" music for sure! The sets and special effects were ground-breaking (I always liked watching the Jupiter 2 in flight, take-off, and landing), high-end, and costly, but added to the viewers' satisifaction and enjoyment of LIS and do not seem to be that dated. It has also helped the show endure the quality of time despite the remarkable advances in special effects seen in television and movies today.
LIS was the ""water-cooler"" show of the season when it first aired. The unfortunate turn of events for the show came when ""Batman"" premiered in February 1966, later that season, and the producers, for what ever reason, decided they needed to compete with the ""camp"" of ""Batman"" and I feel ""dummy-downed"" the program for season #2. Season #3 tried to strike a balance between science-fiction and fantasy, which bounced the quality of the episodes back a little better though the show did end with a fizzle its last two episodes in season #3.
I will anticipate seeing the quality the picture and sound on DVD as I own the complete set of 84 episodes on VHS. Obviously, this set will be easier to store and I hope that seasons #2 and #3 are also ultimately released on DVD set. The show is a ""keeper"" for anyone interested in classic television of the '60's and good quality programming in general, especially season #1.",1064880000,10,2924,4.74656188605108

7988009,1,B00008YGRQ,"This is a terrible series. Its the script - very very lazy...  Some examples:

- The resolute loses its comunications: it can send but cant receive. And the receive part actually fell down to the planet. This starship goes trillions of light years (!!!) but they do not hve the mens to test their communications. Laughable.

- Someone needs to do a major safety upgrade on the airlock on the resolute.

- Judy is swimming down to the spaceship when the water suddenly freezes. Note to writers - stuff doesnt freeze that fast! But you know that and did not care.

- There is a black hole that M. discovers by balooning up to space (of course, the BIOLOGIST knows because hes so observant). And this BH will wipe out life on the planet. The biologist concurs: ALL TREES HAVE ONLY ONE RING! So everything lives one year. But what about the hundred foot trees that are ubiquitous and the old-growth forest they hike through. All that growth in a few months? NO!

Ther are many more examples. They spent money on this series but did not buy good writers. What a pity.",1524355200,,1062,4.476683937823834
7988010,5,B00008YGRQ,"As a nine year old when the debut season of Lost in Space aired in 1965 on CBS. It was the place to be on Wednesday nights . As we baby boomers try to recapture our youth by buying and watching these TV shows ( you can never go home) . The Oasis from air date 11/10/65 written by Peter Packer is quite apropo to our problem on this little blue planet of today. Short on water they know they need to leave the planet that the Robinsons are stranded on. While on a quest to find life giving water the Robinson's discover an oasis pond. Much to poisonous to drink from. But bearing fruit that might sustain them. So Dr. Smith eats the fruit before they know of the ramifications of what happens when one eats the fruit. Well you will just have to watch that episode to find out what happens.  We canot leave this planet today for the shortage of water that we face. Despite Stephen Hawkings and Elon Musk's predictions of thing to come. Irwin Allen was a genius. Though most of the episodes campy. I still loved it over Star Trek. But hey, I was only nine. What did or do I know!",1522800000,,1076,4.173076923076923
