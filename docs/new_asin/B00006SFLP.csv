1793012,3,B00006SFLP,"I'm not sure why someone thought the movie was how to be a filmmaker unless they were confused with the book $30 Film School that was written by the same guy. I thought the movie made its point and that was that if you are motivated to be an artist and being an artist and having a craft is what gets you going in the morning then do it. The movie was about how to survive, not how to strick it rich. All the people in the movie were surviving as artists by doing most everything themselves henceforth the title of the movie D.I.Y. or Die. Maybe it made more sense to me because I'm an artist and my art is my business. I don't know.

Whenever I get an indie film I like to check out the director and the cast before I get it. Then I  look at it from the perpective of whether it's their 1st  (or 21st effort) and evaluate it based on all the tangibles.

Overall, I thought it addressed what it said it would and it was interesting to see all these people talk about what motivates them. It makes enjoying their art more of a multi-sensory experience when you know a little bit about them as people as well.",1096329600,3,1107,4.111111111111111
1793013,2,B00006SFLP,"I just watched that DVD. The message of the piece could be summed up thus:
Just do it! Be an artist and create!
So? What else is new? That DVD is not telling you anything about becoming an artist that you wouldn't already know. Okay, maybe Lydia Lunch (who's brilliant), when she mentions that we won't be able to create very much as long as we're into TV and the web etc. I better log off now!

1793014,5,B00006SFLP,"You owe it to yourself to see this film. It's one of those rare gems that leave you a changed person. Packed with interviews with Lydia Lunch, Richard Kern, Ian Mackaye, Ron Asheton, Mike Watt, J Mascis, Jim Rose, Foetus, Steve Albini, Gwar, Madigan Shive, Tribe 8, and more. The film offers encouragement and information to the aspiring artist in all of us. The documentarians show what can be accomplished just by making the film itself. I can't recommend this film enough. Just go see it and make sure you explore those extras. Excellent.",1072396800,,541,4.76595744680851
1793015,5,B00006SFLP,"Loved it! I bought the book $30 Film School by Michael. In the book he referred to the film quite a bit so I bought it as well. The book was great and the film was just as good. Both left me feeling completely inspired. Hearing the words of so many other artists, and being able to completely relate, gave me hope for the future of art. I plan on buying this DVD for everyone I know as a Holiday gift this year!",1063670400,7,411,3.963855421686747
1793016,5,B00006SFLP,"This was amazing. i saw the movie when it showed here in olympia. I loved it. It was like a one-hour art school. all these great famous people and a bunch of unknown people all given the same treatment.
Good!
This made me want to make art forever.
there's more stuff on the dVD it says. can't wait to see it.",1039305600,,308,4.065573770491803
7973130,5,B00006SFLP,"A very strong message that resonated well with me. Artists who complain about starving should take a look. At least if one continues to be unhappy, they may come to a realization that they are not being swept along by forces beyond their control.",1366329600,2,246,4.613636363636363
7973131,5,B00006SFLP,"I really enjoyed this film and couldn't have asked for a better price or faster shipping. I'd recommend this film to anyone who is trying to make it as an artist, starving or not.",1361836800,,179,4.294117647058823
7973132,3,B00006SFLP,"Pretty good film of doing it yourself. Worth checking it out for sure. If your looking for step by step instructions then look some place els. This film is about DOING IT, and not wasting time pondering.",1358035200,,203,4.513513513513513
7973133,1,B00006SFLP,"I guess there's some merit for this film, and they do address some legitimate issues, but it should be rated ""R"" or ""X."". I was hoping to give it to my serious musician son-in-law, and other musicians I know, but there was just too much filthy talk, morally corrupt images, and perversion in this DVD. So, I give it ONE STAR. I skimmed through it, so as not to be abused too much. At the beginning of the film, it says that some artists in the film are poor, some are scraping by, some are rich, or something like that. And it's no wonder that so many of these artists are complaining, because so much of the ""art"" shown on this disk is just crap, and it blows my mind that this movie gets any good reviews at all. The reviewers are probably other no-talent artists who have found an advocate. Don't get me wrong, I like all sorts of quirky rock music and even modern art, but some of these guys are complaining about how hard it is, but it's because they have little talent, and even less understanding of what people like. The idea that an artist should just do what he likes, with no regard to what might sell, and that people somehow owe them a living, is absurd. The reason they're not making money is that people don't like their art. And they don't like their art because it's not good art. Many of these artists have not paid their dues, so they can't sing the blues, if you get my drift. I thought this film would be more about the actual business of being an independent artist, with suggestions about how to do it, but it was more filled with rebels who didn't want to compromise with ""the man"" (studio execs or promoters and agents), by (e.g) agreeing to remove some filthy song from an album. This DVD is called ""DIY or Die: Burn This DVD,"" and I think I'll do just that.",1355184000,,1784,4.281065088757397
7973134,5,B00006SFLP,"This inspiring and fun film should give any struggling independent artist a shot in the arm.  A musician himself, Michael Dean has the right punk rock-inspired DIY attitude to make this film.  Don't want to spoil it for anyone, but this piece has some belly laughs, some profound, prophetic quotes and some great live performance clips.  It's a steal at $8.",1270080000,2,357,4.819672131147541
7973135,4,B00006SFLP,"I've read Dean's $30 Film School and it's a great guide for the beginning filmmaker so naturally I wanted to check out his first film.  In a way, this is more a collection of interviews than a proper documentary, but it serves its purpose, which is to prove that yes, you too can say %$@* the system and make art and continue to eat while doing it.  If that's your dream and you need a dose of inspiration then you should find this film helpful indeed.",1217462400,,452,4.244186046511628

7973137,5,B00006SFLP,"Being an independent musician and ravenous film buff, I was obviously drawn to this movie for the title alone.
Having seen more than my share of low-budget B-movies and homemade fan films, to tell the truth i wasn't
expecting exactly what this movie was about... an affirmation.
  It seems I was naive to the parallel world of artists,writers,photogs and musicians that this movie delves into.
Interviewing such names as Fugazi, Jim Rose,and J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr, to name  a few, Michael W. Dean
finds much more than a ""How to"" survival guide through his explorations. It is an anthem for the passionate.
It has a spirituality and sense of community. Most importantly, it's done what so many movies have failed to do...
 it's inspired me.

7973138,5,B00006SFLP,"Portrayals of professional artists in American culture are often unrealistic (would anyone know who Jackson Pollock was if Peggy Guggenheim hadn't been paying his rent?) and/or sad (being an artist is about being depressed/tortured/chemically dependent, etc.).  Michael Dean offers us a view into the lives of artists who recognize that their chosen profession requires dedication, hard work, and perhaps a slightly unconventional view of the world.  Those who are looking for a step-by-step guide to 'making it' as an artist won't find that here, everyone has to find their own way.  That's the basis of the DIY ethic.  If you need a reminder that it IS possible to live your life as an artist, you'll be reinspired by the film.  If you wonder whether you have to 'sell out' to be successful, the film will offer some answers.  A very useful movie for anyone in the arts, thinking about an artistic career, or those trying to understand artists better.",1155859200,5,953,4.962264150943396
7973139,5,B00006SFLP,"This is a great movie! It deals with artists who do their art just because it's what they do. The film maker interviews artists of all types from painters to musicians to dancers. It's not a ""How To"" guide as some other reviewers mistakenly thought, but it does give you a look into the lives of artists who are really doing it. People who do their own thing on their own terms. For those of us that believe that is how it should be, this is an extremely well done movie, and definitely worth watching.",1105660800,8,502,4.294736842105263
