4686509,2,B005FXXTAK,"I'm a fan of Hetalia and I love the movie. The actual movie.

I don't know why Funimation did it, but they decided to stick random episodes from the first 2 seasons into the movie. At times, there are 2 or 3 episodes in a row. Its very jarring and irritating to see everyone working together, more or less, to fight the Pictonians, then all of a sudden we're in the middle of WWII or France is proposing to England or England is learning about Japanese culture from a kappa. One of the worst instances is where Funimation decided to interrupt the build up to the final battle with a random episode.

I don't know if Funi felt the movie was too short, but it didn't do the movie or itself any favors. I hope the Japanese studio or manga author complain to Funimation.",1330128000,4,766,4.3125

4686511,5,B005FXXTAK,"Seriously! This movie was amazing and I'm so glad I got my hands on it~! Funimation did a great job with dubbing this movie as well. I watched the movie 3 times in one day~! (The English dub, of course. I really love it and it always has me laughing for the longest time.)

The DVD quality is great, nothing is damaged and it was shipped right on time!

Now, excuse me while I go watch the movie again.",1325721600,,402,4.075949367088608

4686530,5,B005FXXTAK,"I had watched it on Netflix, and would watch it all the time but then it was removed. I was so glad to see this and bought it asap! I'm so glad I did! :D
Not to mention it has awesome bonus features (including an AWESOME commentary with the voice actors, and the Japanese intro, to the first premiere in Japan, where the seiyuus of the axis speak about Hetalia!) and now I can watch hetalia anytime I want!!! There were so many funny moments in this movie, that there was very rarely a time I wasn't laughing like a maniac XD

I highly recommend it!!!

The movie is interspersed with scenes from the original series, nothing new for fans but still fun. The story is wacky but hilarious.",1448841600,,316,4.660714285714286

4686539,5,B005FXXTAK,"I was worried that I had seen all the ""good parts"" already during little youtube clips but I can honestly say that I thouroughly enjoyed this. There were still (new) funny parts for me to laugh at. As far as plot goes it's a typical Hetalia piece. Some scenes flow in sequential order like a normal movie but then out of nowhere there will be a ""flashback"" kind of moment to scenes from Axis Powers dvds, etc. Overall it was definitely worth the price I paid. I've watched it more than once. Hetalia is love. Hetalia is life.",1444003200,2,525,4.36734693877551

4686564,5,B005FXXTAK,I laughed so hard watching this for the first time. If you're a avid Hetalia fan then get this movie!,1410825600,,101,4.1
4686565,4,B005FXXTAK,"I thought this was really funny! It was great seeing the guys in a full length movie instead of the show where you see just little 2-3 minute skits of them. In the movie, however, they do put about 7-8 skits in it like they do the show. The skits were pretty funny, but they had nothing to do with the movie and found myself wishing they would just get back to the movie. The movie is just over an hour long and the animation is really good. The plot itself isn't bad. Yeah, its the same old ""we gotta save the world from aliens"" story, but it isn't done in a cheesy-way and ends very nicely. Not everyone had major parts in the story...Prussia, Romano, Spain, Poland and a couple of others had some quick scenes, but the main heroes of the story are the ones on the dvd cover. Sealand makes an appearance as well towards the end, and he gets a little but more sceen time than the other bit-characters, but it made sense for him to make an appearence the way he does in the story. I love the ending song as well, ""Wa Wa World"" and am hoping Amazon has it for download some day soon. (Hint hint) : )  Anyways, great movie and a must for any Hetalia fan!",1407283200,,1152,4.12
4686566,5,B005FXXTAK,Any hetalia fan would love this movie. I half died when France referenced doctor who!! Another thing that a fan would enjoy would be the funny little random clips they put in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that loves hetalia!,1405641600,,239,4.714285714285714

4686569,5,B005FXXTAK,My grandson and his girl friend enjoyed the first DVD of Hetalia and asked me to order this movie.  They said they enjoyed all the characters and the plot.,1395446400,,155,4.344827586206897

4686572,5,B005FXXTAK,"Great movie, same elements of comedy that just make you die of laughter.
BUT! It incorporates old segments from the show (ex. axis training montages, England in Japan where he sees the kappa and stuff, Russia jumping out of a plain, Italy's song for Germany)
I don't know if that was like, for commercial break or filler. If it IS just filler, which it probably is, it makes me kind of disappointed as a fan that the creator didn't have to means to put more story and new jokes into it.

Favorite part:
Aliens are attacking the whole world, but Switzerland's neutrality is so powerful that even they can't go in it hahahahaha. Made me die of laughter",1382313600,,650,4.508474576271187
4686573,4,B005FXXTAK,And they're fighting aliens! This movie brings back all your favorite Hetalia boys. It's definitely not as good as the anime but still worth watching. The only thing I wasn't happy about is how they took clips from the anime and put them in at random parts of the movie. Still pretty great though. Worth it just for the outtakes. :),1359849600,,332,4.459016393442623

4686577,3,B005FXXTAK,"... so I wasn't really disappointed by it. But its Hetalia, so I had to get it.
