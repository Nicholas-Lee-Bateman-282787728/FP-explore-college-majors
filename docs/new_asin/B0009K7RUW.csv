Next year I can use it with our buddy class that older when we get together to share our reports.  Thanks for your prompt delivery",1398297600,,298,4.285714285714286

Thanks to Alex,I can talk to people sometimes even BETTER without seeing the face.
This documentary will astonish you.
I like it very much.",1148169600,5,374,5.25
8062252,5,B0009K7RUW,Bell is a great man he made it possible for us to talk to other people across the world or across the street. we don't have to see their writing we can now hear their voice and i think hearing someones voice is better than  seeing their writing. it means alot more to many people,961545600,5,279,4.072727272727272
