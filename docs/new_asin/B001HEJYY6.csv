3630291,5,B001HEJYY6,"You can't but mention 'Oldboy' in a review of 'Chaser.'  These are different movies, Oldboy has a fantastical premise and an ethereal stylism, whereas Chaser is a more grounded movie apparently based in fact.  As Chaser unfolds, both the characters and the audience are put through an emotional wringer of hope and doom when an ex-detective-pimp goes in search of his missing girls, purely for financial reasons.  Later, when he finds that he sent the prostitutes into the lethal clutches of a brutal serial killer, Jung-Ho does his utmost to find them.  Some scenes have no dialogue at all, but a distanced Hitchcock feel as the camera simply records a child howling when she realizes that hope for her mother has dwindled, or the wild-eyed Jung-Ho flailing against the restraining arms of a dozen cops.  Korean society is another star of the film, Oedashi (Korean man, Sir, mister) is a citizen, pimp, detective, befuddled beat cop asleep on duty, or Ajima (an older woman) who lives in back of a tiny corner store crammed with snacks, smokes, and soju.  Chaser depicts the real Korea, the juxtaposition of oxen and cell phones, crowded streets and private places, or a Western church infiltrating an Eastern culture.  The long-handled claw hammer makes its dreadful Peninsula reappearance in scenes of utmost violence and cold, psychopathic serenity. The hammer finally brings Jung-Ho to a nuanced point of decision when he holds its dripping claw over the killer's head.  As for the rumors of Hollywood remakes, DiCaprio for Chaser, Cage for Oldboy: ugh, don't bother, you cannot recapture or recreate the magic of these films, the intensity, range of emotion, strange circumstances, black humor, and that most tenuous thread of all; the essence of a society.",1260835200,2,1763,5.055172413793104
3630292,5,B001HEJYY6,"i am a fan of Korean movies, im fan of good american movies, but this movie takes the cake, the whole cake and the bakery. if you like OLD BOY this movie is about to rock your senses, the truth my mouth was hanging and my arms were limp i was stunned at the greatness of this movie. WATCH IT and hope Hollywood does not remake this movie and ruin it!",1260057600,2,350,3.943661971830986
3630293,5,B001HEJYY6,"The Chaser is a very good movie.  It is, however, very violent (just in case that type of movie is not you style).  An ex-cop turned pimp is losing his girls.  In his attempt to find out why, he encounters a serial killer.  He chases him (hence the title).  The rest you have to see.

Be forwarned that the DVD is poorly manufactured (Quality control is not up to normal standards.).  I have bought it twice from two different sellers (one the extended version and one the standard version).  Both discs had two or three hangups of up to ten seconds about three-quarters the way into the movie.  I am not talking about the poor transitions of dual-layer discs.  The discs looked new and were factory sealed, but they played at these times as if they had scratches.",1259020800,4,764,4.471014492753623

These film is da bomb and I am speechless.
The best thing in this film is that, it is so natural and it wasn't overhyped with too much fighjting scenes and most importantly the fighting scenes were very appropriate and the director went for it. Straight gore!

I hope hollywood doesn't ruin it, because they are good at that!",1252368000,6,489,4.258064516129032
3630295,5,B001HEJYY6,"Visceral, nonstop carnage. The brutality in this film make Old Boy look like a joke... because it's based on actual events.

Not as good as Memories of a Murder, but better than Old Boy, tenfold.",1234051200,3,195,4.571428571428571
3630296,5,B001HEJYY6,"The Chaser is a different kind of investigation movie. You are told who the killer is fairly early in the movie, and the plot is about whether they can find proof to prosecute the killer or not. Just before the killer is arrested in the beginning, he has kidnapped another girl, and the main character tries to find out where she is throughout the movie.
The main character is a former detective who has turned pimp, and the killer has presumably kidnapped and/or killed all his girls, making it very personal.
There isn't much high-octane action in the movie, as this is mostly a thriller and not an action movie. The story is quite interesting, following mainly the pimp and the murderer seperatly. The story happens mostly at night and has a rather dark atmosphere, but it also has several comical moments that will make you laugh. The scenes are also fairly realistic. For example in foot chases the characters will get tired and sweaty really fast and when the chases are over they will typically gasp for breath and sometimes trip. I think this is very cool to see considering that in Hollywood movies characters can run full speed for 10 miles without sweating.
Overall, I think this was a very good movie! Great atmosphere, good story, realistic and funny.",1233446400,2,1264,4.723981900452489
3630297,4,B001HEJYY6,"Korea has definitely caught up to Hong Kong in the action/thriller category with ""The Chaser"" being one of the best Asian crime flicks in years. Our anti-hero is a dirty ex-cop thrown off the task force for taking bribes. Now reduced to running an escort service, his girls start disappearing. Thinking they quit & ran off or ""were sold"", he sends off his last girl, a sympathetic ill mom raising her small daughter alone, not realizing the client is a serial killer that had murdered the other girls. After he (literally) runs into the killer by accident, the rest of the film becomes a suspenseful edge-of-your seat thrill ride as he must find the missing girl before she dies & nab the killer, despite police department interference, political pressure to release the guilty suspect & ring of keys as his only clue!
If you loved Korean crime movies like the great ""Nowhere To Hide"", ""Les Formidables"", the first ""Public Enemy"", etc. you are in for a treat. Even if you've never seen any contemporary Korean thrillers other than ""Old Boy"", this is one you cannot miss! As I hear it, the same people that took HK's great ""Infernal Affairs"" & remade it in English as ""The Departed"",  plan the same fate for this one. If you are like me & prefer the original, subtitles and all,  do not miss ""The Chaser""!",1229990400,4,1304,4.640692640692641
3630298,5,B001HEJYY6,"This film has too often been dismissed by film critics in the English-language press as being ""manipulative,"" ""relying too much on coincidence"" or ""too violent."" Some critics have even questioned the performances as being lackluster.

They couldn't be more wrong. This film is one of the best films to come out of South Korea in the last decade and is up there in its obsessive storytelling with the likes of Park Chan-wook's OLD BOY and Kim Ki-duk's THE COASTGUARD.

The story is about the chase to stop a serial killer by the least likely of protagonists, a former detective who was kicked out of the force for taking bribes and is now a despicable pimp.

This pimp is moved to act after some of his call girls go missing. At first he thinks some lowlife out there is abducting his girls and selling them to another human trafficker. Gradually, it dawns on him that a serial killer is killing them. Meanwhile, in the background, the police are also conducting an investigation to try to catch this killer.

Of course, this straightforward description doesn't do the film justice. THE CHASER is the best kind of thriller. In addition to social commentary about various aspects of modern city life, it is masterfully-crafted and executed.

What do I mean by this? As is usually the case with the best storytelling, the film places the viewer in the exact place and viewpoint of the protagonist, whose single-minded pursuit of the villain is hampered by the bungling of the very police who banished him from their midst. The film puts the viewer through all the emotions that the protagonist goes through. If you watch this film and do not find it emotionally draining, then it's time to go get a check-up because something is kaputt.

This film has its share of violence, gore and blood, but it is not your conventional whodunnit or gore fest spectacle a la Miike. The killer, one of the most chilling serial killers in film histroy, is revealed very early on (in the first 20 minutes) to the audience, and soon afterwards, to the police. What follows is what grips the audience.

Simply put, THE CHASER is a film that sinks its teeth into the viewer from the start and doesn't let go. It's packed with tension. Were it a book, it'd be the best page-turner. Its depiction of the serial killer is truly chilling.

Depicting the journey of a fallen man who comes to grips with pure evil, it is an intelligent film for adults but also wholly accessible and entertaining.",1229472000,23,2467,4.694444444444445
3630299,4,B001HEJYY6,"Modern society have always spawned some ruthless serial killers and Asian countries such as South Korea is no different. ""THE CHASER"" (aka. Chugyeogja, 2008) is a film based on true events, and has won numerous awards in its native land. The film is a box-office success all over Asia, and it is no surprise that Warner brothers (U.S.) with Asian ""remake king"" Roy Lee had already bought the remake rights to the film. Directed by newcomer Hong-Jin Na, the film is part crime thriller and part psychological drama.

A cop turned pimp named Jung-Ho (Yun Seok Kim, the fantastic ""Tazza the High-Rollers"") is in a financial bind. He runs a door-to door masseuse company and he had lost a lot of money when some of his top call girls started running out on him after he had given them financial support--or so he believes. After a ""client"" rejects some of his other girls, he sends Mi-jin, who also has a daughter, (beauteous Seo Yeong-Hie) to attend to the needs of client # 4885. Being a former cop, Jung-Ho connects the dots and concludes that his girls started disappearing after meeting with this client; he assumes that he is a rival flesh trader and informs Mi-jin that she needs to text him upon arrival on # 4885's home. When Mi-jin herself fails to report and disappears, Jung-Ho is caught in a situation that he must find the truth about this client--named Young-Min Ji (Jung Woo-Ha); who for whatever reason confesses that he had killed 12 people to the police. But where is Mi-jin? Jung-Ho is becomes obsessed in making his own investigations.

The film unravels as a cat and mouse game, and rather than having it between the police and the killer, the game is played by two very unlikable characters. Jung-Ho is an antihero and Young-Min is a psychotic killer, that detail is revealed early on in the film. What makes the film enthralling is the fact that the script effectively takes its time and fleshes out the two main characters. The film focuses on the heart of the investigation by the police and Jung-Ho and the proceedings prove quite riveting. The film is based on a true event and I am certain that certain elements have been added to make it more exciting, but since the film is based on actual case files, I think it would be safe to assume that it is close to the real story.

""The Chaser"" is full of effective twists and turns. The film is full of edge of your seat thrills, pulse-pounding action, immersive characters and there are also some touches of black humor to help the film's 2 hour running time. The incident occurred when the Seoul mayor had been assaulted by an angry mob in a local marketplace, so expect the cops being torn between political pressure and the sense of urgency to find the evidence. The police wants to get Young-Ji behind bars and Jung-Ho is on the race against time to find Mi-jin--dead or alive. Mi-jin's daughter also proves an effective plot element as you will root for Jung-Ho with just one look at this child.

The film has a finely-honed cast; Yun Seok Kim and Jung Woo-Ha does share dynamic chemistry even though they're hardly together in one scene. The killer is definitely your usual bad guy but what made his character compelling is how the film slowly unravels his motivations and the antagonist proves every bit as psychotic as other iconic serial murderers. Psychopaths have no knowledge of right or wrong, decent or indecent. Ji-Young Min is imbalanced and the viewer will know this from the start, what happens next is the film's main strength as it delves into his twisted mind.

Asian films are rather uninhibited when it comes to violence against women and this film displays a graphic amount of this element. The film does have its share of bloody and brutal scenes, the torture and mental anguish experienced by Mi-jin will be felt by the viewer. While we have definitely seen more graphic sequences especially in films by Takashi Miike, director Na came close, but he also exhibited some restraint in these scenes. Korean actress Seo Yeong-Hie does an outstanding job however limited her screen time may be. The film is quite terrifying and disturbing, and also very sad, the bleakness in its premise is portrayed throughout--but it also contains a certain warmth when you consider everything.

I have done my best to avoid giving spoilers except for giving some hints on the film's characters and what exactly you are in for. The film has an abundance of twists and turns, and you'll have to experience it to truly enjoy the film. Complemented by the awesome acting skills of the two leads, (most especially Yun-Seok Kim) and a very empathetic victim, the film is gripping. What I really liked about ""The Chaser"" is that it pulled no stops in displaying the ineptitude of the local police force and the arrogance of authority figures; the general public had been shortchanged as this film would portray. This incident had angered a lot of the Korean people and I am certain that you would feel the same way I did.

""The Chaser"" is a riveting, entertaining experience and well worth the expensive price tag of the region-3 Korean release. The only fault I could find is that some may think it is overlong but its 2 hour run time will go by very quickly. You just have to see it before Hollywood remakes this film and becomes butchered by American filmmakers, Asian remakes very seldom works.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]
Note: There has been talk that the U.S. remake has Leonardo DiCaprio in mind--hopefully he'll play the killer? It is planned to be released sometime late next year.",1224892800,8,5567,4.719135802469136
3630300,5,B001HEJYY6,"This film is so Korean. The way it is shot and the way the story is told don't conform to the way many Americans think genre clues should be presented and adhered to. At it's heart, The Chaser is a crime drama about a serial killer and the guy who's chasing him, but it evolves from many different angles. It's a comedy of errors in the way the police and politicians are portrayed; a melodrama with its inclusion of the precocious little girl who belongs to the woman serving as the film's primary ""chase"" and investigative point; a psychological thriller in the way the serial killer messes with the minds of the police; a mildly gory film in the way the bad guy uses a hammer and chisel; a bit of a tragedy in the way it ends. The only thing missing from this film is romance. Thank god they didn't make one of the missing girls a love interest of the pimp--he's only after the money they owe him. That's where the brilliance of the chase begins.

There's a fight scene early on where our protagonist, an ex-detective gone bad turned pimp, is beating the crap out of some guy he thinks has kidnapped and sold some of his girls. A long uphill foot chase precedes the brawl so both combatants are extremely winded when the fighting begins--punches don't land and there's a girly incompetence to the whole thing, which is to say, it's realistic. After finally landing a few punches that subdue his opponent momentarily, the pimp gets up and starts kicking him in disgust. He's very angry, still a bit winded and out of control. One of his kicks only grazes its target causing him to lose his balance and fall on his butt, and because of momentum he begins to roll and his feet fly up in the air. It seems funny, but it's not. You have to sneak in your chuckle as he gets up and continues kicking the guy. When he's finally pummeled his adversary into unconsciousness, he uses his foot to roll him onto his side so he can get to the wallet in his back pocket and ID him. He attempts to sit on him, not to keep him down, but because he's bone tired from all the fighting. He doesn't land squarely which causes the bad guy to shift a bit, and consequently he lands on his butt again. It seems funny but it's not.

After the fight scene both men are brought to the police station for questioning. Because the pimp is an ex-detective with a reputation, the cops initially sympathize with the other guy, thinking the pimp over-reacted--not to mention the causal fender-bender that brought the two men together in the first place. The pimp doesn't know that the other guy just took a hammer and chisel to the head of the girl he is trying to get back, he thinks she's just freshly been sold, making his sense of urgency misplaced, where it remains throughout most of the film. It's kind of awkward for the police to find much urgency in one pimp accusing another of stealing one of his girls. The bad guy insists he didn't sell the girl and then mumbles under his breathe ""I killed her"", and confesses in great detail how he killed her and several other girls. The pimp screams at the cops, ""Can't you see he's just pretending to be crazy now?""

And so it goes. We know there's been killing going on and we know who's been doing it from very early on in the film but it manages to remain suspenseful throughout. The Chaser is a gripping thriller from the beginning until a few minutes from the end. The two main characters are portrayed with impeccable nuance. It's Yun-seok Kim's performance as the bewildered pimp that takes this film to great heights. There are so many things that don't go the way he wants them to, like people hanging up on him when he's talking to them on the phone, a little girl who startles him and asks too many smart questions, the cops can't do anything right; and every time, his subdued response of confused disbelief made me laugh. He brings a Kang-ho Song-ish melancholy humor to the film, (I can't think of an American actor to compare him to), while Jung-woo Ha as the impotent serial killer is so normal and unmoved it's creepy.

There are a handful of groan out loud plot moves in The Chaser, but so what. There are also more than a handful of plot moves this film doesn't do, moves that most people will be guessing it will do, that it more than makes up for it. This is a film I know I'll watch again just for the performance of it. The plot won't matter. It's that good.",1224547200,6,4403,4.392156862745098
3630301,5,B001HEJYY6,I found this movie fascinating and very cruel in a beautiful way.  Well done and deserves a USA version. The writing and the editing is superb. The girl's acting is amazing. Love the killer's mundane look.,1455580800,,205,4.694444444444445

3630306,4,B001HEJYY6,"Interesting serial killer movie that was intense, well paced and somewhat comedic at times.  As a viewer you know early on who the serial killer is (played by Jung-Woo Ha).  However the main character (a detective turned pimp played by Kim Yun-seok) and the cops aren't sure as the pimp is just looking for some of his missing girls and the cops don't have any hard evidence.  This leads to some of the over the top (sort of comedic) moments as the pimp and cops are doing their own investigation and are stepping on each other's toes and also mishandling the suspect.

There are some intense scenes in the early and late part of the film, but most of the middle portion of the movie involves interrogation of the suspect and subsequent investigation into his claim that he is the serial killer (but he doesn't give the cops any specifics and they don't know where he lives).  Kim Yun-seok does a great job as the former detective/pimp as his concern, anger and frustration mount throughout the film.  The other actors do a credible job as well and there are some nice heartfelt moments between Kim Yun-seok and a little girl (daughter of one of the missing girls).

The movie is in Korean (with English subtitles).  Some of the comedic moments may have been exaggerated because of the subtitles - I'm never sure with foreign films how accurately the subtitles convey the actual dialogue and inflections.  Overall a good film that kept me engaged throughout.",1423872000,,1458,4.708661417322834
3630307,5,B001HEJYY6,"The other reviewers have described this movie in detail, and so no spoiler alert needed here.
I love Korean films and TV shows, however, I do not like this type of film.
This movie is an extremely violent, graphic, and bloody horror movie.  However, the writing is brilliant, and if you like this type of film, then you will probably like this one.
The film shows a great amount of violence, especially against women, since the antagonist is a serial killer.  Korean films often lack a realistic, well developed antagonist, but the serial killer presented here is no stereotype.  He is very different from any that I have ever seen before in any other film.  He is very unusual and probably crazy, but he still seems very human - he does not seen like a bad person or a monster.
The police are forced to let him go in spite of his detailed confession - he seems too passive to be a killer, and they have not real evidence against him.  Will he kill again?  Will the police find evidence against him or will he get away with it.
At one point, when being questioned, the killer is asked to explain why he killed, but he is not given a chance to answer.  At the end of the movie, as the ex-cop/pimp is solving the case/mystery and chasing the killer, the pieces come together to explain why he murdered women.  Brilliant writing and a great movie!  I will not spoil the ending.
The child, a girl, in this film is awesome, and as she is recovering in the hospital at the end, there is a gesture suggesting humanity, hope, and redemption.  This is Korean film making at it's best.",1418169600,,1575,4.418685121107266

There were some characters who died; who I would have like to seen survive....other characters who survived, I would have liked to see them die.  The ending could have been very ""edge of your seat"" suspenseful and it was very lackluster and seemed to be over quickly.

3630314,3,B001HEJYY6,"Actually 3 1/2 stars in my book. This is a well crafted and somewhat original serial killer thriller from Korea. Great locations, direction, pace, and so fourth. It's clearly no Silence of the Lambs or se7en, hardly in the same league, but it's still a pretty effective thriller. I actually thought Yun-seok Kim's performance was noteworthy and electric with heroic realism. And a few others here and there were pretty good, but as for the rest of the cast I was a bit put off. What I mean to say is that most of the actors in this film play their characters as though they are almost splapstick, comical or stupid personality wise. In fact the lead character's assistant was downright all three, and strangely his name in the film happened to be Meathead. These moronic characterizations nearly ruined the entire film for me, and the presentation of many of the police officers in the film portrayed them as near pathetic morons. Morons who didn't seem to know the first rule of good police work is to never cuff a detained prisoner with their hands in front of them, which is how they cuff every suspect in the film. Downright sloppy police work right there. None the less I have to say I am sorry to dissagree with another member who was praying hollywood doesn't do a remake. Im praying they do. Put this story in the hands of Demme or Fincher and you might have another first rate Oscar thriller on your hands. This story is just begging for a big hollywood remake done right. Don't get me wrong, this film is pretty great, but not as expertly crafted as either of the american directors I mentioned would be capable of managing.",1367884800,,1634,4.580204778156997

A ex-cop turned pimp who left the force to avoid criminal charges of his own reluctantly searches for one of his missing girls, only to end up matching wits with a particularly sadistic killer. The hilly urban landscape with it's congested, narrow streets is as much a character as it's a metaphor for these two adversaries.  The plot doesn't toy with the viewer; it brazenly reveals much early on, but till manages to keep upping the tension.

If you have any patience at all for subtitles, and any tolerance for action thrillers, THE CHASER is a must-see. Yes there's blood and violence.  The best chase scenes are ones that would not work in a Hollywood production.",1351814400,,759,4.6

3630318,4,B001HEJYY6,"""The Chaser"" is a serial killer film from South Korea, where it won a slew of awards and widespread popular appeal. In Seoul, Eom Joong-ho (Kim Youn-seok) is feeling the heat of his creditors. He is an ex-cop, ousted from the force for corruption, now in the prostitution business. Two of his prostitutes have recently disappeared. Another has quit. So he has insisted that Kim Mi-jin (Seo Yeong-hie) go out to attend a customer in spite of her being sick. But then he realizes that the client he has sent her to was also the last to see the other women. Joong-ho assumes that the man is a rival pimp stealing his prostitutes. He sets out to find the man, and their altercation leads to both being arrested. Oddly, when he is interviewed at the police station, the client, Ji Young-min (Ha Joung-woo), says that he has not stolen the girls but murdered them.

If that sounds like the end of the film, it isn't. It's the beginning. ""The Chaser"" offers no mystery as to who has committed the murders. He confesses. The police are not sure if there have actually been any murders. But those who believe him are put upon to find evidence within 12 hours, because the suspect must be released unless a prosecutor approves the arrest within that time. So the race is against time, with the cops trying to find bodies and Joong-ho frantically trying to locate the man's house in the vicinity of Mi-jin's abandoned car using some keys that were in Ji Young-min's possession. Joong-ho becomes a man obsessed. And he is not one to control his emotions. He's a hardened misanthrope who communicates with his fists. In addition to gruesome serial killings, a lot of people are beaten to a pulp.

Director Na Hong-jin excels at creating a sense of chaos in nighttime Seoul. There is a continuous bustle of activity that doesn't seem to have direction. That is the atmosphere in which this hunt unfolds over a period of less than 24 hours. Though it lays out the solution to the audience early on, it still manages to surprise us. And not with pleasant surprises. ""The Chaser"" does not have an optimistic outlook. It does strain credibility in making it absurdly difficult for Joong-ho to locate the killer's house. It would be easy to check doors on the street where the missing woman's car was parked. And the film invokes a tired clich in having the immoral cynic Joong-ho develop a sentimental attachment to Mi-jin's adorable 7-year-old daughter (Kim Yoo-jung). But it gives us a gritty, intense hunt and doesn't feel the need to make its protagonist look good.

3630319,5,B001HEJYY6,"Having seen for the past month, South Korean thrillers, I have to give a thumb up to this one, as well. Love the main character due to the ability of showing soft and tender moments, but at the same time rough and sharp. The scenes are very engaging from beginning to end and the OST is great.  the different turns the movie takes are very captivating and not even expected. I even, give credits to the officers or policemen's  dullness to execute their jobs. Showing the inability to be efficient officials when an alleged crime situation was presented. As a previous reviewer did, Old Boy is a must see movie. I personally favor, Mother due to the most unexpected end. The same reviewer that brought up Old Boy made a comment about the color combination of clothing of the chaser and the chased in the final scene, which I found interesting to point out: One black shirt and white pants and the other white shirt and black pants-Yin and Yan dual harmony-.

3630323,3,B001HEJYY6,"When in Rome, right? I just started watching Korean movies after seeing the great The Man From Nowhere. Chaser was a film I saw often in my Amazon recommendations and I jumped at the chance to watch it.

Now, I don't know if it's a cultural thing, but some films just seem . . . disjointed to Western sensibilities. Take Chaser for instance. The most gripping and exciting scenes involved Kim Yeon-suk in his pursuit of the villain. I think the movie took a downturn after the criminal was eventually caught. Ha Jung-Woo could take lessons in being chillingly smug as the villain from Kevin Spacey a la Se7en, but his turn seemed kind of mailed in. I don't know if it was to dial up the gore/ body count, but somewhere in the latter half of the movie the director decided to turn this gripping drama into a snuff film. It seemed like no matter what . . . well, you just have to watch it.

As the lead Kim Yeon-suk owns every scene he's in. Another reviewer noted the duality of his character as noted by his black and whit ensemble. How it was perhaps indicative of his dual nature being former cop making a living as a pimp. But I couldn't see how in the climactic scene the antagonists similar black and white garb something similar in his nature. As a movie-goer, I'd have been more satisfied if Yeon-suk was allowed to mete out his own brand of justice with a slow motion fade to black of him whaling away at the villain blood splattering his face, I mean . .. since they went the snuff film route anyway.

The only other character worth mentioning is the little girl. She gives the film a sort of emotional gravity that would have been lost in between chase scenes. I don't understand why she had to be a victim as well. I think that's something that would have been explained in a western film.

Overall, not bad. Not as good as The Man From Nowhere, but head and shoulders over Mother and Bloody Ties.",1311897600,3,1908,4.366197183098592
3630324,5,B001HEJYY6,"I saw this ages ago and have just re watched it, and I have to say it is still stunning second time round. The plot is that an ex cop turned pimp Joong Ho (Kim Yoon-seok) thinks someone is stealing his ladies, as they keep going off to meet clients and not coming back. He and his sidekick, `Meathead', decide that after one of his last girls goes missing to do some searching. It soon becomes obvious that some of them have all disappeared after seeing the same punter. A punter who he has just sent Kim Mi-jin (Seo Young-hee) to go and service - as it were. He tells her to text the address as soon as she gets there. Without wanting to spoil the plot, she has a bit of a service outage and the chase to find her is on.

This is a film where Na Hong-jin (director and co-writer) keeps up the pace at a blistering level. It is shot beautifully in a way that makes it look effortless and natural at the same time. All of the characters are portrayed as being very human and very fallible. There are asides into humour too that fit just perfectly. This is a thriller with some gore, but most of the violence is straightforward fighting. The tension is piled on especially when Joong Ho discovers Mi Jins seven year old daughter and reluctantly takes her with him.

There is great attention to detail and I have seen criticism that the plot is too `far fetched', well I hasten to disagree as this film is based on the true life story of serial killer Yoo Young-chul. He was sentenced to death for twenty murders and cannibalism in 2005.

This is a stunning piece of original cinema that is nigh on hard to fault, it is in Korean with excellent sub titles. If you don't like subs then Warner Bros may have the answer as they have bought the rights and are thinking of a re-make with Mr DiCaprio as the star. I suggest doing yourself a favour and seeing the original, I am pretty confident that it far outshines any attempt at copying. Excellent Korean film that I can not recommend highly enough.",1311724800,2,1993,4.323529411764706

3630327,2,B001HEJYY6,"This could have been a very good movie, but IMHO goes off the rails in the final act.  The tone of the film shifts dramatically in a way that jerks the audience around more than it tells a good story.  First you are laughing, then you are elated, then you are horrified and sad.  It's more manipulative than it is creative and to me it felt a bit condescending.

On the upside the premise is solid and the performances are strong.  If it wasn't for the final quarter of the movie I'd have given it 3 1/2 stars.

I expect many people will enjoy this movie more than I.  However to me there is little more here than a generic thriller.",1302825600,4,633,4.181818181818182

3630329,4,B001HEJYY6,"I don't know what it is about the South Koreans but they have a way of taking well worn genres and turning them on their ears with innovative plotting. I've seen a number of them and I'm always amazed at how I expect a story to go a certain way and it never does. ""The Chaser"" is no different.

Here's the scoop. A one-time detective turned pimp is losing his girls. He thinks they're running off but then finds some evidence that suggests one of the regular johns is selling them. He finds he's wrong again and therein lies the heart of things.

As others have mentioned, the line between good and evil is not so clear here. You want the 'hero' to prevail but he performs some number of acts throughout the film that make him out to be a less than good guy. This is drawn right up to the final confrontation between him and the villain in a scene where he is wearing a black shirt and white pants and the villain is wearing a white shirt and black pants. There are other nods to the duality of things and many are very good.

What is interesting is the plotline itself. Had this been a Hollywood project you could pretty much figure early on what would happen. Little, if anything, happening here is what you would expect. The plot took so many unexpected turns it kept me intrigued the entire time. So as not to spoil anything I might get a bit vague here, but let me say that something most viewers would expect to happen near the end of the movie happens early on here. I was scratching my head wondering where could they possibly go from here. I found out.

This is simply a great movie. The acting, the production, the directing and music are all top shelf. You really get to like the 'hero' because, even though he might not be kind of guy you'd like to sit and have a beer with, he does what he does because he acts from his heart. The only weak part might be in the police procedures. That is one thing we tend to do well in American cinema. This is really a four and a half star film. If you like to go off the beaten path, even in a familiar genre, this should be right up your alley.",1301529600,4,2095,4.19106699751861
3630330,5,B001HEJYY6,"Maybe my title is based on a stereotype, but it's a good stereotype. I've been watching Korean movies for six years now, beginning with Memories of Murder. I moved on to the Revenge Saga (Sympathy for Mister Vengeance, Oldboy, and Lady Vengeance), with a few others sprinkled in (The Host for one). All of these movies have a strange authenticism to the way in which the story is told. Fight scenes aren't these amazing sequences of superhuman abilities. They're real, dialed-down moments of violence and humanity. And the stories themselves are so unpredictable refreshing that it makes me wish that American film-makes would take notes. The Chaser is no different.

It follows an ex-detective turned pimp as he tries to sort out the strange disappearances of some of his women. Financially unable to just let these women up and leave, he uses his old talents and begins his own investigation. What he gets is a phone number, which leads him into a dark series of twists and turns. Now, he must not only find his missing women, but help the police to prove the guilt of the man he suspects of ""selling"" his women.

As I said before, The Chaser is a refreshing thriller. The story itself is told in many ways, sometimes funny or slap-stick (but never over the top), sometimes heartbreaking, and often times dead serious. This the directoral debute and yet it feels like a movie made by one of the industry vets. He's able to keep the pace of the film fast without losing or overwhelming the viewer. Of course it helps having phenomenal acting filling nearly every scene, even by a young seven year old girl.

All in all, The Chaser is an astounding film. I'm not often surprised anymore, but this movie has surprised me. I thought I saw the best that Korea has to offer, yet they offer The Chaser. If you're a fan of the movies I mentioned above, then there is absolutely no reason you won't enjoy The Chaser.",1300838400,12,1909,4.6420118343195265

The Korean cops could care less about this pimp Joong-ho (Yun-seok Kim) and his problems, they just want him to get out of there sight. This movie is pretty twisted up and has some great actors and cool plot lines running here. I have read that this is based on a real serial killer from Seoul and this helps keep you glued to the film. The prostitutes daughter is so good in this movie as is the serial killer who just wants to get on with his killing spree.
I do hope to see the remake when it's done if Hollywood can pull it off. I know some folks get ticked off when they redo a good movie like this one but the story is to good to pass up and we know for a fact how lazy most American movie watchers are they just will not read a movie as it plays.
I like the remakes of ""REC"" and ""Let the Right One In"" so maybe this will hold up for a American remake.

3630333,4,B001HEJYY6,"When it first hit the screens in Korea in 2008, it quickly became one of the most talked about movies of the year and it certainly remains one in 2010. Na- Hong Jin could not asked for a more perfect directorial debut. The film at heart is a cat and mouse story about a serial killer who is caught not by the police but because of an independent investigation launched by a pimp who thinks that this person is a rival who is stealing all his girls. Many of the incidents are culled from real life events from the hunt for the serial killer Yoo - Young Chul. The movie was a excellent entertainer right from the very first frame. Each scene has been expertly written, directed and acted. I think I saw one of the most well written final 30 minutes in a movie. I loved this movie. 4 stars 11/28/10

PS, If you liked this movie, you will also enjoy Memories of Murder ( read my review)
There is a rumor that Leonardo Di Caprio is set to star in the American version of Chaser, I hope Leo plays the serial killer.",1291334400,2,1009,4.201030927835052
3630334,5,B001HEJYY6,"For years I have heard that the Koreans are especially skilled in the craft of storytelling.  (As opposed to other Asian groups and their own filmmaking proclivities)  That's not entirely a fair statement, as most of the things we see in the U.S. goes through many distillation steps until only the masterpieces are shown to us.  I'm sure every country has their own Steven Seagal movies they'd rather keep hidden from the world.

I thought The Chaser was going to be another Takashi Miilke-type ultraviolent gangster movie.  It's far from it.  There's no stylized romanticization of violence a la Tarantino.  It's just a full-on, unflinching noir film about a cop-turned-pimp trying to get one of his girls back from a job.  The story begins simple enough: A fender bender at an intersection.  And before the first fifth of the film is through, the serial killer has already been apprehended, confessed, and in the police station.  So where can it go from here?  THAT is the craft of Hong-jin Na's Chugyeogja (The Chaser).  From this point, the story keeps twisting, building, and gaining momentum and suspense, until you are literally standing up from your seat, tearing your hair out and screaming (I'm still bald and hoarse).

Joong-ho (Yun-seok Kim ) the pimp is as hardboiled a detective as they come.  None of that Bowflex, South Beach diet, gym rat body of today's glitterati Hollywood A-list, more of an everyday man in the tradition of Mike Hammer, kicking, punching, and scolding his way through the story, trying to get his working girl back.  Nobody is exempt from his brusqueness.  Little girls, women, old folks, police officers, bystanders all get a special serving of his insensitivity.  You will begin the movie with ""what a jerk!""  And to the credit of the writers, by midway of the movie, you are on the edge of your seat cheering for this guy, an unlikely, out-of-shape hero.

I say if Hollywood decides to remake this one (and they will) it will be completely lost in translation.  The qualities that make The Chaser work is the stark realism of the characters, the staccato nature of the conversational language (which adds to the unnerving tension).  For viewers in the U.S., who are not familiar with these actors, they look like they could be anyone off the street.  Watch for the scene when the killer is sitting behind the computer talking to the female police officer.  You don't know the meaning of intimidation until you see this fella slither over the top of the monitor.  The Chaser is focused on pure storytelling, stripped of much of the cliches that manipulates your emotions (something Hollywood, in it's focus on pure Box Office returns, keeping everyone happy with a neat-ending, starpower, suffocating soundtracks, and high decibels will never be able to accomplish).  The violence is minor by today's standards.  There's blood, but the moment of impact is all offscreen.  If you can make it through one sequence of any of the SAW movies, you'll be ok with this film.",1291075200,,3007,4.879684418145956

3630336,5,B001HEJYY6,"Modern society have always spawned some ruthless serial killers and Asian countries such as South Korea is no different. ""THE CHASER"" (aka. Chugyeogja, 2008) is a film based on true events, and has won numerous awards in its native land. The film is a box-office success all over Asia, and it is no surprise that Warner brothers (U.S.) with Asian ""remake king"" Roy Lee had already bought the remake rights to the film. Directed by newcomer Hong-Jin Na, the film is part crime thriller and part psychological drama.

A cop turned pimp named Jung-Ho (Yun Seok Kim, the fantastic ""Tazza the High-Rollers"") is in a financial bind. He runs a door-to door masseuse company and he had lost a lot of money when some of his top call girls started running out on him after he had given them financial support--or so he believes. After a ""client"" rejects some of his other girls, he sends Mi-jin, who also has a daughter, (beauteous Seo Yeong-Hie) to attend to the needs of client # 4885. Being a former cop, Jung-Ho connects the dots and concludes that his girls started disappearing after meeting with this client; he assumes that he is a rival flesh trader and informs Mi-jin that she needs to text him upon arrival on # 4885's home. When Mi-jin herself fails to report and disappears, Jung-Ho is caught in a situation that he must find the truth about this client--named Young-Min Ji (Jung Woo-Ha); who for whatever reason confesses that he had killed 12 people to the police. But where is Mi-jin? Jung-Ho is becomes obsessed in making his own investigations.

The film unravels as a cat and mouse game, and rather than having it between the police and the killer, the game is played by two very unlikable characters. Jung-Ho is an antihero and Young-Min is a psychotic killer, that detail is revealed early on in the film. What makes the film enthralling is the fact that the script effectively takes its time and fleshes out the two main characters. The film focuses on the heart of the investigation by the police and Jung-Ho and the proceedings prove quite riveting. The film is based on a true event and I am certain that certain elements have been added to make it more exciting, but since the film is based on actual case files, I think it would be safe to assume that it is close to the real story.

""The Chaser"" is full of effective twists and turns. The film is full of edge of your seat thrills, pulse-pounding action, immersive characters and there are also some touches of black humor to help the film's 2 hour running time. The incident occurred when the Seoul mayor had been assaulted by an angry mob in a local marketplace, so expect the cops being torn between political pressure and the sense of urgency to find the evidence. The police wants to get Young-Ji behind bars and Jung-Ho is on the race against time to find Mi-jin--dead or alive. Mi-jin's daughter also proves an effective plot element as you will root for Jung-Ho with just one look at this child.

The film has a finely-honed cast; Yun Seok Kim and Jung Woo-Ha does share dynamic chemistry even though they're hardly together in one scene. The killer is definitely your usual bad guy but what made his character compelling is how the film slowly unravels his motivations and the antagonist proves every bit as psychotic as other iconic serial murderers. Psychopaths have no knowledge of right or wrong, decent or indecent. Ji-Young Min is imbalanced and the viewer will know this from the start, what happens next is the film's main strength as it delves into his twisted mind.

Asian films are rather uninhibited when it comes to violence against women and this film displays a graphic amount of this element. The film does have its share of bloody and brutal scenes, the torture and mental anguish experienced by Mi-jin will be felt by the viewer. While we have definitely seen more graphic sequences especially in films by Takashi Miike, director Na came close, but he also exhibited some restraint in these scenes. Korean actress Seo Yeong-Hie does an outstanding job however limited her screen time may be. The film is quite terrifying and disturbing, and also very sad, the bleakness in its premise is portrayed throughout--but it also contains a certain warmth when you consider everything.

I have done my best to avoid giving spoilers except for giving some hints on the film's characters and what exactly you are in for. The film has an abundance of twists and turns, and you'll have to experience it to truly enjoy the film. Complemented by the awesome acting skills of the two leads, (most especially Yun-Seok Kim) and a very empathetic victim, the film is gripping. What I really liked about ""The Chaser"" is that it pulled no stops in displaying the ineptitude of the local police force and the arrogance of authority figures; the general public had been shortchanged as this film would portray. This incident had angered a lot of the Korean people and I am certain that you would feel the same way I did.

""The Chaser"" is a riveting, entertaining experience and well worth the expensive price tag of the region-3 Korean release. The only fault I could find is that some may think it is overlong but its 2 hour run time will go by very quickly. You just have to see it before Hollywood remakes this film and becomes butchered by American filmmakers, Asian remakes very seldom works.

8308737,4,B001HEJYY6,"Although it is at first glance just as improbable as any other cop-action movie, The Chaser has the benefit of highly probable performances for the most part. The characters, acting and direction get you into a story that might be run-of-the-mill in other hands, and this is therefore a cop-and-killer movie that's many notches above the rest.

The main cop here is actually an ex-cop who's become an unsuccessful pimp with a harebrained sidekick and some lackluster girls. One of those girls, a single mother, is kidnapped by a serial killer who, for once, does NOT have a Hannibal Lecter genius IQ, but who is smart enough to keep his mouth shut about where she is.

From there a cop movie plays out, and we see some brutal things that would not likely be found in a similar American film. The Chaser also features nice artistically framed scenes in low-life settings that are a sign of careful filmmaking.

One scene has a tougher psychiatrist than would likely be found in American movies examining the killer. Others have the ex-cop interacting with the missing hooker's young daughter in ways more believable than Hollywood-cutesy. Others credibly portray the killer as an overgrown disturbed teen who is far from a diabolical mastermind, but just as dangerous. The film is full of good stuff that is not afraid to deviate from the central action thrust for a bit, and this should be refreshing for Americans regularly subjected to pointless car chases and shootouts.

Atmospheric summer rain falls in many scenes here, and a ""noir"" atmosphere prevails throughout, sprinkled with episodes of rough humor. And many scenes depict beleaguered working-class cops who are overworked and pulled between silly political concerns and trying to do what's most important.

This film also helped me realize that there are elements to some Korean interactions that I'd once thought were movie overacting, but which I now am taking a more appreciative view of. The chaotic scenes in police stations here particularly impressed me in this way.

Were this a lower quality film one might say it gets overwrought towards the end. But here the theatrics work for the most part because a general core of realism has been established.

Reportedly an American version was made of this, and you can bet that that one WILL most likely be overwrought and melodramatic.

8308739,5,B001HEJYY6,"A pimp (Kim Yoon-seok) sets out to mess up the jerk (Ha Jung-woo) whos stealing his whores and ends up as a desperate man trying to rescue an injured woman (Seo Young-hee)  from a serial killer and recognizing his complicity in her situation.

This film does two things remarkably well.  First, it makes the protagonists character arc believable and moving through action alone.  Secondly, there are several plot twists that would seem to deflate the tension in the plot by removing the element of menace (I don't want to give any spoilers, but an example is the killers confession to murder while in police custody fairly early in the film), but developments inevitably bend toward the films culminating tragedy.  In an extraordinary debut, first-time writer / director Na Hong-jin presents fully realized characters in a gritty, messy modern-day Seoul.  Like Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, he employs coincidence in a way that feels inevitable rather than contrived.  An extraordinary film.",1468886400,,996,5.1875
8308740,5,B001HEJYY6,"This is a wrenching and impossibly dark movie that will tear your heart out. Part police procedural, part tone poem on loss and suffering and modern alienation taken to their worst extremes, this film will leave you feeling lonely and broken and bereft. It is superbly done down to the last detail and almost inconceivable to picture watching for a second time. It is a work of terrible, pitiless art. I don't envy you the result of your journey through it, but the dip of your toe into this movie's devouring waters will leave you with your heart in your mouth like few other movies.

This is not a casual evening's viewing, nor one to see with a casual audience. Though the gore is light, send the right people to bed. You'd like them to wake up that way. With a little more hope. Enough to get through the daily tasks of living. This movie is a beautiful monstrosity. It makes me grit my teeth. I don't know whether to recommend it to you or not. It never lies, but it is hard to embrace.",1466294400,,991,4.356756756756757
