8532621,5,B008YO1ZV2,Its the best ever! Cant wait for the other season's to arrive! My little brother loves it! Even my dad!,1434499200,,103,4.2
8532622,5,B008YO1ZV2,"This animation, ""The Secret Life of Insects"" is some of the best I've seen.  The insects are animated against beautiful scenery - French countryside.  Their adventures are short, funny, and beautifully constructed.  You need a code-free DVD player to see them.  They are all over Europe - I saw them in Australia - TV stations use them as short fillers and on news programs.  People on this side of the pond ought to get to know these wonderful bugs!",1359331200,,450,4.6455696202531644
