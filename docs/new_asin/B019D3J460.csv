7570362,3,B019D3J460,"The imagery and special effects are superb for an independent film and watching Tiffany Shepis is a true treat. I found it quite satisfying and true to the 80's horror film style. The cinematography is awesome as well, color was very vivid and nice for a change in horror flicks. Great production value really and it held my attention. Fun little flick!",1475625600,,353,4.709677419354839

7570366,4,B019D3J460,Like Tiffany Shepis movies,1470787200,,26,5.75
7570367,3,B019D3J460,A definite 80s horror vibe. Cheesy in a really good way. I grew up on horror films from the 70s and 80s so this was right up my alley. It's an indie film so don't expect a trillion dollar budget but that's kind of what 80s style films is all about.,1470096000,,248,3.8823529411764706

7570373,3,B019D3J460,"The plot to She Wolf Rising is, shall we say, an afterthought. Even though the premise is interesting, it doesn't do too terribly well on the execution. There's not too much to it besides watching Tiffany Shepis, but then, you get to watch Tiffany Shepis, so one also can't complain. It's worth a watch, but keep your expectations low.",1465948800,,335,4.694915254237288
7570374,1,B019D3J460,The five star reviews must have been posted by the people actually in the movie; that's the only rational explanation I can come up with. Seems like a high-school level production.,1465344000,,180,4.838709677419355

7570378,1,B019D3J460,This movie is really bad... just really bad. The plot is dodgy at best and it's very confusing.,1462579200,,95,4.333333333333333
7570379,2,B019D3J460,"Looking for a nice werewolf flick that doesn't have to be too great, just good enough for wasting time?

Then keep going!  :D

This film is bad. Not a good-bad. Just a bad-bad. Some poor acting, a poor script (OMG, do guys really talk to one another like that voice-over wants us to believe?), a poor plot that's hard to follow until you've seen the whole thing and cringed it over in your mind, and scenes as scary as a silent fart lost in the couch cushions. But I just can't bring myself to give it one star. I can't even say it's the worst werewolf flick I've ever seen. Why not? Because I've seen ZOMBIE WEREWOLVES ATTACK, is why. Now that movie right there... that movie isn't trash. It's the trashcan that sets the standard for all other trash films. This film rates higher than that by eons.

But that doesn't change the fact that it's bad. At all. Believe me. So, look--in short--this movie isn't the worst movie, but it's close. If you're looking for something to pass the time, and the acting and/or plot doesn't have to be perfect, then go find something else. I promise you won't have missed anything in skipping this vampire-bat-shifter looking mess.",1461974400,5,1164,4.5285714285714285
7570380,1,B019D3J460,"One of the worst movies ever. The story, acting, direction is so stupid a 10 year old could have done it better. What is wrong with people who make movies like this.",1460592000,,165,4.1875

7570394,3,B019D3J460,"Gina Skylar (Tiffany Shepis) is a true scream queen who may or may not turn into a she wolf when you speak lines from horror films. She meets Jake Bubar (Timothy Mandala) a fan and they hit things off well as they go on a quest to find a missing film.

The film is mostly campy and at times tries to be funny with a director (also called a producer) who recites old lines from movies and acts like Groucho Marx. There are times the film becomes serious for a few minutes and in the end it just becomes stupid as they PLOT SPOILER do the film within a film nonsense, apparently not knowing in which direction to take the movie. It was a film that every time I started to get into it, it would kick me out. The production was up and down and unfortunately the ups were not that high. Some camp and cult value (Debbie Rochon).

Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Tiffany Shepis, Ruby Larocca, and was that Linnea Quigley topless on a background photo? )",1456444800,2,943,4.262569832402234

7570400,1,B019D3J460,"Oh my god, do not, DO NOT rely on the other reviews if you're bored and looking for something cheesy to blow a bottle of wine over. My wife loves B rate horror flicks, LOVES them, I hate them. WE BOTH LOATHED this movie. ""Stupid"" doesn't even cover it when trying to explain how banal the plot is, the acting is so third rate if it got any worse the negative volume of things I could say about it would eventually become so sarcastically dense that the comments would develop a proportional atomic weight and cause the entire intellectual structure of space and time to fold in on itself and tear a hole in the very fabric of the universe, collapsing the earth into a black hole. Which would be a good thing, because with humanity eradicated no one could ever make a movie like this again.

The special effects are all done in adobe after effects, a friend of mine's band shot a music video rife with blood splatter and gun shots using it last year, the work was done by the drummer's little brother who was a first year graphics student at their local community college and this jumble of garbage makes their video look like a big budget MTV production. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch this movie and judge it for yourself, I'm telling you that if you watch this movie after reading this review you're encroaching on the DSM V's definition of self harm and might need to see a therapist.",1453334400,12,1391,4.43359375
