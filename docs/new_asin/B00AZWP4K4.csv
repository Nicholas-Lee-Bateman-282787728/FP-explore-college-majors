8559918,3,B00AZWP4K4,"After two high-profile disasters (The Stendhal Syndrome and Phantom of the Opera) Dario Argento made a shameless attempt to jumpstart his flagging career by ripping himself off, doing a Giallo that was intended to be very much in the style of his beloved early films (Bird With the Crystal Plummage; Cat O'Nine Tails; Deep Red).  He even went so far as to have the defunct Goblin credited with the soundtrack.

The results aren't entirely satisfying because Dario Argento's directing skills have clearly deteriorated since the 1970's.  He attempts to create one of his classic suspense sequences early, with a woman pursued on a train by a mad killer--but the direction is sloppy, lacking the precision and imagination of Dario Argento in his prime.  Still, even with its faults, Sleepless stands as one of Dario Argento's better post Opera films, not because it's particularly good but because his post Opera output has been so frustratingly spotty.

I won't even go into the story because it doesn't matter--the plot is just an excuse for the bloody murders.  Max Von Sydow shows up as a retired police inspector with insomnia who is interested in the case.  He is fine, as always (Dario Argento isn't a very good director of actors so working with ones who don't need much direction has always benefitted his films) but unlike David Hemmings and Karl Malden before him, Von Sydow actually has a supporting part with screentime comparable to Donald Pleasence in Phenomenon.

Sleepless is a pretty serviceable thriller that would be easier to appreciate if it were a Dario Argento homage rather than a film by Argento himself.  As later Argento pictures go it manages to stand out like The Card Player and Do You Like Hitchcock? for actually being watchable, but it's also more than a little sad since it represents such a steep decline quality wise when compared with the earlier films it is clearly meant to imitate.  Sleepless is not the best introduction to Dario Argento but if you are already a fan it likely qualifies as good enough.",1461974400,,2041,4.889855072463768
