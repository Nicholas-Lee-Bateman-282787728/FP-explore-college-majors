8488190,4,B005WYJLTA,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like ROH, DragonGate, and NWA.  There wasn't a special theme behind this event but for those who noticed these type of things, head referee Rick Knox refereed every single match on this card.

The main event here was a dream match for the current followers of Ring Of Honor as P.W.G. Champion Kevin Steen defended the title against the current Ring Of Honor Champion (although he wasn't acknowledge as it on this show) Davey Richards in a match that had both men playing up to the crowds chants along with strong storytelling & counters from both men in a match that saw them kick out of every move possible to the point where you had to almost kill one of them to get the win.  Other matches include P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks defended against The Dynasty in a match that got so out of control that the referee had to get physically involved to get control with both men stealing pages out of each others playbooks various times, the P.W.G. debut of the Super Smash Bros. vs. the RockNES Monsters in a match that stole the show as it was fast paced non-stop action while both teams had enough references to Street Fighter & Mortal Kombat & Tekken that it was a video gamers heaven, Brian Cage-Taylor vs. Peter Avalon, Willie Mack vs. Ryan Taylor, Eddie Edwards vs. T.J. Perkins, and El Generico vs. Rocky Romero.

While the undercard here wasn't as strong as the previous shows have been, this was still a strong showing & possibly the ""sleeper"" show of the year with the World Title & tag matches really standing out here so this is a show worth checking out.",1333756800,,1827,4.647058823529412
