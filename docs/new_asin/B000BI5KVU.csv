2419108,5,B000BI5KVU,"We are big Wiggles fans in our house.  They did a re-make of many of the their popular songs on this one, but what truly stands out on this DVD is the Captain Feathersword portion.  My kids get up and dance to this DVD each time.  Captain Feathersword is just as big to my kids (or bigger) than The Wiggles, so this is a great DVD for us.  If your kids love C.F. then this would be a good choice for your collection.",1168300800,,416,3.9759036144578315
2419109,4,B000BI5KVU,"This is a good CD for someone who just likes the Wiggles. Grand just loves them, so we buy them all.",1167868800,,100,3.8095238095238093
2419110,5,B000BI5KVU,"When I first got Wiggle Around the Clock, I had no idea that it would have most of the Wiggles' songs from their offical music video movie, called, Wake Up, Jeff... which I think was made in 1999.

One of the new songs that I had gotten used to right away, were called, ""Frog-Went-A-Walking"" and ""Guess What"".  I love Captain Feathersword's song the best.",1154044800,,355,4.53125
2419111,5,B000BI5KVU,My daughters love this one and there are a lot of good songs that we've not heard before.,1152489600,,89,4.0
2419112,4,B000BI5KVU,Bought this as a gift for my friend's son and he loved it. He loves all of the Wiggles DVDs and I think this one had at least one new song.,1152057600,,139,3.5161290322580645
2419113,5,B000BI5KVU,"This video is SUPPOSED to be a remake of Wake Up Jeff! They wanted to reshoot it sans cardboard big read car, etc. It is a fun, fun video, much better than Sailing Around the World (which has great songs, but far too many skits) and better than Here Comes the Big Red Car, especially since the Wiggles are dancing their hearts out in this one. Right now, this is one of my favorites. We didn't already own Wake Up Jeff! though, so it was still mostly new to us.",1149638400,5,461,4.133333333333334
2419114,3,B000BI5KVU,"Here we go again - another mixture of oldies, mostly from &#8220;Wake Up Jeff&#8221; with some new introductions and arrangements.  The songs are the same, but the accompanying video has been updated, and some are now in cartoon format.  On the positive side, at least The Wiggles showed up this time.

Song list:

1. We Like to Say Hello &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video)

2. Henry's Underwater Big Band &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (cartoon)

3. Having Fun at the Beach &#8211; from Wiggly Play Time and Wake Up Jeff (new video)

4. Bing Bang Bong (That's a Pirate Song) &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video)

5. Wake Up Jeff &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video, with a bed on the beach!)

6. Bucket of Dew/Paddy Condon From Cobar &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video, Claire Field and friends dancing with paper rose petals falling around them)

7. Romp Bomp a Stomp - from Magical Adventure and Wake Up Jeff (new video with dancers in marching band costume, accompanied by children)

8. A Frog Went a Walking &#8211; cartoon &#8211; from the Wake Up Jeff CD

9. Take a Trip Out on the Sea &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video, new boat, new children)

10. Dorothy (Would You Like to Dance?) &#8211; from Magical Adventure and Wake Up Jeff (new video, same dance steps)

11. We're Playing a Trick on the Captain &#8211; new song and skit by crew of SS Feathersword as in Sailing Around the World

12. Have a Happy Birthday Captain &#8211; new song done Greek style as in Sailing Around the World

13. I Can Do So Many Things &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video)

14. Guess What? &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff CD (cartoon)

15. Wave to Wags &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff (new video, same dance steps)

16. Havenu Shalom Alachem &#8211; from Wiggly Play Time, Yummy Yummy and Wake Up Jeff (new video on the beach)

17. Walking on the Moon &#8211; (new song, Wiggles at a Space Centre in space suits)

18. Piper's Waltz &#8211; from Wake Up Jeff

Extras:  A cartoon story &#8220;Greg's Musical Surprise&#8221;; Dorothy the Dinosaur talking about washing your hands and brushing your teeth (Warning! Maximum annoyance rating); Photo Gallery; TV Episodes 3 and 4 of &#8220;Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles&#8221; and the Song Jukebox.

If you have the &#8220;Wake Up Jeff&#8221; video and CD, and you've followed the TV shows, you really don't need this one, as the new material isn't worth the price.

However, if you're a Wiggles newbie, this one is much better than the last few Wiggles productions, and one you might want to get.

2419115,5,B000BI5KVU,"The Wiggles have added a few new songs to their repertoire on this DVD, and they do a great job of intermingling them with some of the ""oldies"".  The color is vivid and so is the music on this video, which became a new favorite of my two-yr-old after the first viewing.  She wants to watch every time we turn on the DVD player.  There are some great songs for dancing, like ""Having Fun at the Beach"" (one we haven't seen before), ""Wake Up Jeff"" (an old favorite), and even some traditional songs, like ""Frog Went A Walking"" and ""Havenu Shalom Alachem"".  There's ""Happy Birthday Captain"", which appeals to all children who love birthday parties....like mine!  The bonus features are good, too, including 2 bonus episodes of ""Lights, Camera, Action"" and a photo gallery.  This video is well worth the money you'll spend.  A great birthday gift for children under five, especially since (at the time of this writing) this one is a new release, and kids aren't likely to have added it to their collections! And if your child likes to wiggle, giggle, move, groove and interact with The Wiggles, this is a good purchase for you!",1145923200,2,1122,4.636363636363637
2419116,5,B000BI5KVU,"This video is in the same league as The Wiggles eariler videos.  It contains some old and new songs, it's colorful, fast paced, and, best of all, The Wiggles appear in just about every performance.  The dialog is quick, makes sense, and is easy for my 20 month old to follow.  There is a song or two from Captain Feathersword and his gang, but they don't spend gratuatous time on these scenes like they did in ""SATW"".  This is much more suitable for toddler and young pre-school viewers.",1145059200,11,487,4.5
2419137,4,B000BI5KVU,"But the kid loves it! We have several Wiggles dvds and this one seems to be the favorite, always watches it first.",1377475200,,114,4.2272727272727275

2419140,3,B000BI5KVU,"The video has some good songs and my 15 month old enjoys watching it. My only complaint is that it seems like all the songs were taken from a previous video  ""wake up Jeff "".",1332633600,,174,3.9714285714285715
2419141,5,B000BI5KVU,I am very happy with the Wiggles dvd's and with the seller... Amazon did a great job too. I will continue to shop for dvd's on Amazon and from Tawnsplace.,1326153600,,154,4.166666666666667
2419142,5,B000BI5KVU,"We have tons of DVDs, but this one seems to be our son's favorite.  It gets played quite often, but we don't mind it at all.  In fact my wife and I find ourselves singing the songs too!  Some kids' DVDs can be downright unbearable for adults, especially if kids want them played all the time.  Not so for this one: I think it's just great.",1292544000,,339,4.090909090909091

2419146,4,B000BI5KVU,"This is one of our first Wiggles dvd's.  My kids love it. The visuals are great. I think the songs are pretty catchy and... not terrible.  I appreciate the Wiggles for the use of harmony and interesting instrumentation while not losing the simplicity that appeals to kids.  They are definitely one of my favorite kids' groups.

The only negative about this dvd is that the dubbing is just terrible!  It is rare that the lips of the performers are mouthing the same word that we're hearing.  My kids are not bothered by it and as long as I don't actually look at it, it doesn't bother me either.  But goodness, you'd think they could get a better dubbing engineer.",1207526400,3,663,4.5210084033613445
