916181,4,6304680694,"I want to thank Image for a wonderful transfer. The sound and picture quality is wonderful on this DVD. The story has been told here so no need to go over it again. Very enjoyable story of the first rocket into space. I would add that the ""pinkish"" color used to ""colorize"" Mars looks very good, much better than the ""cinemagic"" used in the later movie, Angry Red Planet.",1039478400,11,371,4.391304347826087
916182,3,6304680694,"I bought this without ever viewing it previously.
First we must realize the time period it was produced in and that it is after all science fiction. Yes it was hokey, but if we
are a true follower of this classic genre we will want to see this one and the price is right.  This 75 minute venture into the
unexplored with Loyd Bridges and Hugh O'brien is worth the trip.",1033516800,8,369,4.197183098591549
916183,4,6304680694,"Ok, first check the price.  Now you can not expect three movies all carefully restored before being transfered to DVD.  Having said that, Devil Girl from Mars and Rocketship X-M came from print that has few, if any distortions, the Monster from Green Hell was pretty poor, but even when it played on TV it never was very high quality.  If you are trying to build a collection of old B-rated sci-fi movies, this is a good economical choice.  I gave it 4 stars primarily for its low cost, and movies that have many actors/actresses that are early in their careers.",1028332800,11,562,4.534653465346534
916184,4,6304680694,"In this movie, we have the story of earth's first flight to the moon but an accident occurs on the ship and the crew finds themselves heading toward Mars. Once on Mars, they discover a dome-shape building, a metallic mask and figure that at one time a ""superior"" race had once lived there. While most of the crew is killed or injured before the ship can take off and head back to earth, the crew does discover ""prehistoric-like-people"" still living on the planet.
The film was made in the early 50's but the tinted-red filming on Mars is effective.",1028246400,5,548,4.545454545454546
916185,3,6304680694,"Of course I was a kid when I saw Rocketship X-M, nevertheless I am tired of the bad press I have heard over the years. I remember, even now, that I thought it must have had a limited budget. The special effects, I thought, were more than acceptable, even for the time period, and you can believe that I paid special attention to effects even at the age of thirteen. The one reason that I don't give it another star is because of the scene that showed a jacket rising slowly from the back of a chair long after gravity had become nonexistent. And I think I remember correctly when I say that none of the crew ever floated . . . for the duration of the trip.",1024185600,3,656,4.1328125
916186,5,6304680694,"Rocket Ship XM, this is a real blast from the past that I last saw when first released in 50's England. The sepia tinting of the Martian sequence gives an authentic feel to the Martian landscape. A great Sci-Fi flick of it's day, the only disapointment with the DVD is the replacement of the mish-mash of Rockets used for the launch, by vague rocket trails that look very NASA.",1015459200,3,377,4.478260869565218
916187,2,6304680694,"The rocketship control room had some nice details, didn't have quite the cardboard look that some old movies and TV shows did. There's very little else to recommend this movie for, it's kind of insulting without even much 1950 science and worse scripting. Might have been good for a ten year old to waste a Saturday morning with but definitely not the best of the breed. Destination Moon, even Project Moonbase are better.",986601600,7,422,4.794520547945205
916304,3,6304680694,"It's not a stellar effort but worth watching IF you can suspend reality. Their ""science"" is completely off and could have been checked by any number of books at a public library (such as the first ed of Ley's). Escape velocity had long since been determined plus I doubt many space vehicles have an air speed indicator (aside from this one) or course corrections as a command to ""turn"". And then there's the descent thru space to Mars - with clouds going in a straight line beside the rocket!",1484179200,,492,4.53932584269663
916305,3,6304680694,"Kinda nice but probably very boring for today's culture.  Director tried to play it straight in terms of the then science in terms of the ship , the people, the flight.  The fantasy portions were oh, ok for the time but of course doesn't come up to today's imagination in terms of space.  As usual Loyd Bridges stood out. (Am aware of how Hollywood took a dump on the guy-Red Scare!)  Very talented actor.  Slow in today's terms.",1484006400,2,429,4.448717948717949

916313,4,6304680694,"I remember this movie from when I was very young seeing it in the local theater probably on a Saturday morning. Maybe because of nostalgia or because Lloyd Bridges stars in it, I gave it one star more than my initial impulse. There are some aspects that detract from the film like WWII era weapons on a flight to Mars. There is no weightlessness during the voyage nor protective gear other than oxygen masks while on another planet. Just a few years later we got to see the real thing when astronauts blasted off into space. That reality makes part of the movie seem silly. The end, however, is a departure from the normal Hollywood fare.",1481500800,,638,4.508620689655173

918002,5,6304680694,"excellent Mars movie, sort of Destinatino Moon, but with a twist, everything goes wrong. the anxiety grows as you watch the movie to see what more can go wrong, it is a thrill ride all the way to Mars! Even the Martians are hostile(and they should be, it's 1951!) but this movie is primarily about the technicalities and perils of space travel, it depicts it very well it is VERY thought provoking, as many early fifties movies are, very technical in piloting and crewing a space craft, they do not fool around this is as close as it gets with out prior knowledge of NASA(since there was no NASA then). This, Destination Moon and Flight to Mars are solid sci-fi, not just low brow B-movies. though the latter, Flight to Mars was a bit of a soap and the ship more a walk in the park, this movie is primarily about the flight but also somewhat goes into the expedition to Mars(not planned in mission) a surprise sub plot, and dealing with the ruins of a Martian City depicting the degrading of society on Earth, much as most of the ""atomic age"" cold war movies of this time are. the political satire is much the same as in most sci fi of the 50's but the technicalities of spaceflight are what make the show, much as Destination Moon, yet less optimistic!",1424390400,,1253,4.428571428571429

What you have to ignore are every law of physics you know, haha, They just launch into the sky, no trajectory or launch window, they are all wearing street clothes, yep, jeans, leather jackets etc. when they land on Mars, they just need an oxygen mask because Mars is just like us, atmospherically and gravity-wise. did I mention the mutants on Mars?

918193,4,6304680694,"I have been an enthusiastic fan of science fiction movies since I was a small kid.  I originally saw this movie at a theater when I was about 10 years old and it made an impression on me at that time.  When I saw that this film was now on DVD I had to purchase it.  Rocket Ship X-M is only 77 minutes long and stars Lloyd Bridges, Osa Massen, John Emery, Noah Beery, Jr, Morris Ankrum and Hugh OBrian.

The story centers on the first flight of a space ship into space.  The group was supposed to go to the moon but some freak accident shot them all the way to Mars. They land on Mars and begin to explore it, which is when the trouble begins.  The special effects in those early years of science fiction movies is laughable today; nevertheless, viewing this DVD brought back memories when I was a youngster.  The dialog also was interesting because today they would be considered somewhat sexist.

If you enjoy old science fiction movies you might want to check out this DVD.  A good nostalgic early science fiction movie.

It paved the way for many movies to come with mutants as a result of a nuclear war. It was made in the early cold war era when schools were having, ""duck and cover"" drills and there was a paranoia about nuclear war. I cannot reccomend this, instead go for The Day the Earth Stood Still, Destination Moon, Forbidden PLanet, or It! The Terror From Beyond Space (an inspiration for the movie, Alien), these aree just a few suggestions of good scifi from the 1950's.",1399507200,,631,4.495652173913044

918392,3,6304680694,"Silly claptrap about a manned rocketship headed for the Moon which goes off-course and lands on Mars instead!  This may have been one of the first movies in the sci-fi wave of the 1950's, but it's about as believable as Georges Melies' ""A Trip to the Moon"", made back in 1902.  (That's the one in which the rocketship pokes the Man in the Moon in the eye upon landing!)  Here we have a crew that doesn't board the spaceship until it's five minutes away from launching; a beautiful woman scientist who is constantly being asked why being a housewife and mother wasn't enough to satisfy her; and a group of scientists who decide to lie down and take a nap in the Martian soil when they get tired.

The strange thing about this film is that, despite being appallingly inept, it's still kind of fun to watch.  Certainly the cast is a huge plus: Lloyd Bridges and Osa Massen make a beautiful romantic couple, and the impossibly handsome Hugh O'Brian displays an affable charm in one of his first sizeable roles. (Despite the claim on the DVD insert, O'Brian did not make his debut in this film.  He'd already had a couple of walk-on parts in other movies, had played a large supporting role in ""Beyond the Purple Hills"" and had been seen in a co-starring role in ""Never Fear"" which was released the year before.)  The special effects are amateurish (the meteors look like pieces of flying Cracker Jack popcorn), but the Martian sequences are impressively filmed in sepiatone and the set decorations are clever, especially in context of the film's limited budget.  The ending of the film is somewhat surprising; I won't spoil it by revealing any specifics, but I can say it wasn't at all what I was expecting.

The DVD transfer of ""Rocketship X-M"" is outstanding, especially considering its provenance.  This feature was originally released by Lippert, a low-end distributor not known for the quality of its prints.  This film has been remastered and, despite a few minor glitches, looks and sounds great.  The disc includes a nice bonus in the form of the original theatrical trailer:  ""You've READ about it!  You've TALKED about it!  Now SEE it!"").  Recommended to genre aficionados and to fans of the vastly underrated Lloyd Bridges and Hugh O'Brian, two actors who richly deserved the later success they enjoyed in, respectively, ""Sea Hunt"" and ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"" on television.

TRIVIA NOTE:  Bridges and O'Brian later became off-screen business partners, owning and operating a hotel in Palm Springs along with Dennis Weaver, Aaron Spelling and Spelling's then-wife, actress Carolyn Jones.",1392163200,,2606,4.857466063348416
918393,5,6304680694,"I viewed the 2000 restored DVD which was done very well. The film was interesting from a cultural and lack of science point of view as compared to today. The tittle of the film stands for Rocketship Expedition Moon, but REM would cause confusion decades later when the band by the same initials would show up on the scene, so good foresight on that one, but alas it stops here.

During the trip while meteors were missing the ship, Lloyd Bridges was hitting on Osa Massen. In that day and age the reporter asked, ""Why have a woman on the trip?"" instead of ""Why Not a woman in space?"" And yes meteors made whooshing sounds in space.

The gauges all say ""General Electric"" and the earth actually does have longitude lines, something I thought man simply conceived. There was no ""Tang"" on the mission, but they did serve sandwiches and zero gravity only affects flight jackets, not people.

The navigator is an astronomer, because God knows without a professional astronomer to direct the rocketship to the moon, they might go off to some other planet like Mars...which they did and without a prime directive. Here they missed out on Rock Creatures, Insect society, and Hungarian accent leaders so they can make a South Park statement about nuclear war, something like ""Nuclear War is bad. Okay.""

And during the film, they ""go around"" the earth, travel ""parallel"" to it, but never do they use the word ""orbit.""",1391731200,,1408,4.711382113821138

All three movies have a few similar traits that reflect the time-frame when they were made:  1) All astronauts wore WWII military type clothes in space and only needed a space helmet with oxygen, 2) Interiors of the rocket ships all reflect WWII military technology, 3) All crews seem to have one wise-cracking smart guy who played the harmonica, and  4) When a rocket ship needed to land, they all spun around backwards and landed on their fins.  Now that's technological nostalgia!  I loved all three of these movies.  I think Destination Moon had the best FX and showed what weightlessness in space was like much better.

A space ship from earth is to explore the moon but, after some miscalculations and such that are explicitly recognized in the movie dialog, it arrives instead at Mars and lands there to explore.  Some of the images I remembered clearly were when the space travelers from Earth are resting in a cave and suddenly see the natives moving outside (up to no good), and the imposing metal mask or helmet in the sand from the planet's earlier civilization.  There is, of course, flawed science and silly stuff, and the 1950's signature sexism, but these inevitable traits are not as heavy-handed as in some movies from the era.  What stands out is that it's an attempt to be reasonably serious and accurate (it's not by our contemporary standards, but it clearly reflects the attempt at the time it was made), it has a reasonable plot and some twists, and the acting is okay.

918563,3,6304680694,"Im willing to make a lot of allowances where old sci-fi flicks are concerned, but a dull plodding plot isn't one of them.  This movie begins with a press conference that is anything but scintillating (like a bad flashback of the worst college lecture, some drivel about practical interplanetary travel, and a lengthy introduction of the crew).  All the while a countdown is announced, an unhurried reminder of the time before takeoff!  A justification for including a female member of the crew is also offered before they casually stroll to the rocket....6 minutes remaining.  Plenty of time to chat and joke (at that rate the rocket should have taken off without them!).  Of course, time is always fudged in movies and they make it onboard, stalling for one last look at terra firma before they step inside.  Undo consideration is given their one female passenger.  Ph. D. in Chemistry aside, apparently this woman needs help getting into the control room and being strapped into her bunk for takeoff; the men, of course, dont.  Several condescending jabs later, how does a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place?  Makes one wonder why she even volunteered to go along, it certainly wasn't for the prestige!
Funniest scene, the crew looking out portholes, complaining about the eternal night, while eating sandwiches.

Rushed into production by low-budget Lippert Pictures to compete with the more prestigious&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destination-Moon/dp/6305761078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destination Moon</a>this actually reached screens first (in June 1950), and though I don't believe it had anything like the impact that the color production had, it's reputation has climbed somewhat over the years and I doubt I'm the only person who would rate it (slightly) higher now.  While it's got it's share of longeurs and boring exposition, that share is smaller and is undercut by the humor and charismatic presence of Lloyd Bridges, as one of the five crewmembers of the first expedition to the moon, which accidentally gets diverted to Mars instead (these kinds of gigantic mistakes happened all the time in early science fiction, going back at least to an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel in the 30s which featured a ship bound for Mars accidentally landing on Venus instead).  Once there, a seemingly dead civilization is found, and troubles start to occur, and soon it's a question as to whether the mission will make it back alive.

This is uncharacteristically pacifistic in tone - at least as compared to many other 50s SF films - ambivalent about science, and has a pretty amazingly downbeat ending. The sets and model work and background paintings are all pretty swell; Osa Massen is also along for the ride and she's dishy, and provides for a fascinating mixture of pseudo-progressive attitudes about the role of women, constantly undercut by anti-feminist sentiments - for example, she's built up as an amazing scientist, as a key member of the expedition in the early, expository scenes, but once onboard when things are going wrong, she's berated and treated as an ""emotional woman"" by the leader of the mission, Dr. Eckstrom (John Emery) - who later turns out to be wrong himself.  Still having a woman shown to be more or less the equal of men - and a non-American actress playing her at that (Massen was Danish) - has to be counted as somewhat challenging to the status quo of the time.  Perhaps it's the presence of an uncredited Dalton Trumbo as one of the screenwriters that gave the writing in this it's somewhat liberal and questioning attitude, especially as compared to the brash macho characteristics in the writing and performances of DESTINATION MOON.

All in all, coupled with the bigger-budgeted and better-known film, this makes for an interesting start to the first great decade for science fiction in American cinema.  There have been several slight variations in the prints of this film, which some other reviewers here and elsewhere have gone into great detail on; for myself I'm not much interested in the minor changes that collector/producer Wade Williams made to the effects of the film in the 1970s, they don't diminish the film particularly nor do they add much of value.  The Martian sequences sometimes are seen in sepia (brownish) tones, sometimes in red - this DVD offers the sepia, and while I'd prefer the red, again it doesn't really have that much of an impact.  If you're more a purist than I am, I suggest you read a lot of reviews and make your purchase carefully.",1303603200,3,3266,5.110694183864916

Just in case something should go wrong, you have an able engineer named Major Corrigan; if you could just get him to stop talking about his beloved Texas.

Mr. Chamberlain is the navigator.  He is a highly educated and prestigious astronomer and somewhat of a worrywart.

Your pilot is Mr. Gramm.  He has had many practice flights in the simulator and should be able to handle any contingency - as long as he can keep his eyes off your assistant: Doctor Lisa Van Horn.

You don't have to worry about Lisa being distracted by the goo-goo eyes of the young Mr. Gramm; she is a real professional, nothing will deter her from checking and rechecking the proper fuel mixes for each phase of this mission.

The launch goes as planned; you reach escape velocity, jettison the tail section, everything seems nominal, but after awhile, the engines unexpectedly shutdown.  You and Lisa independently calculate a new fuel mix; your figures don't match, but then you are approaching the Moon, you feel rushed, you decide to ignore Lisa's calculations; you have just made your first fateful mistake ...

Don't expect to learn about spaceflight from this movie; almost everything shown is wrong.  For example: you can not go straight up for 300 miles, turn the ship 90 degrees, and fly parallel to the Earth's surface.

918832,4,6304680694,"ROCKETSHIP X-M (stands for expedition moon)..........1950
One of the 1st space films that introduced us into the 1950's sci-fi craze.
a Lippert films production. Introduced  a very young Lloyd Bridges.
The films premise is mankinds 1st expedition to the moon , a group of specialists of 4 men and 1 woman.
The ship some how goes out of control putting spaceship X-M on a course for Mars (strangely the ship had a lot of fuel to make a long trip to Mars ? ? ).
Again we learn what happens in a world with war and atomic weapons. Mars is a war-ravaged world that has been transformed from a superior intellect to a prehistoric savage world.
X-M is filmed in black and white until they arrive at Mars , then the film is in a pinkish hue.
No special effects are really used, far off scenes of the gigantic ship are really just painted backgrounds. The close-up scenes of inside the space ship are pretty standard props with all kinds of impressive gauges and dials and so on. Remember this was one of the 1st movies of its kind ,so the audience was supposed to be at awe over these instuments ,  space exploration at that time was still in its infancy.
Some of the amusing moments of the movie:
......At the very beginning the group was giving a press conference when the countdown had already begun at minus 9 minutes, heck they had not even begun boarding the ship until it was minus 4 minutes,just casually walking ,  Oh and they strapped in at minus 30 seconds.
......They wore just normal issue army type clothing . Got off on Mars with not even a space suit, wore their normal clothing.
......Used a old WW II short wave radio for communications back to earth.
......Was originally a trip to the moon, some how they had enough fuel to make the trip to Mars and almost back to Earth ??
......Fired pistols and rifles on the surface of Mars ?? Could that work ??

Great 1950's fun , break out the popcorn and soda.
This is the 50th anniversary edition DVD , excellent clarity.",1268265600,2,1976,4.435261707988981

918834,3,6304680694,"ROCKETSHIP X-M is black and white and on the short side, only about 75 minutes long. The film stars Lloyd Bridges, later of Sea Hunt fame. Sea Hunt was a television show about a scuba diver (Lloyd Bridges) who was the single parent of a teenaged girl. Lloyd Bridges is also the father of actors Beau Bridges and Jeff Bridges.

The movie starts out with a press conference, where all the astronauts are sitting up front at a table. The press conference occurs some 15 minutes before lift off. We learn that the female astronaut (Ph. D. in chemistry) was chosen because she had designed the rocket fuel. She looks like Katherine Hepburn, and her character acts mature and focused. From the start, she is subjected to gentle preconceptions from the era (the 1950s) as to the role of women. First, when a reporter asks her why she was chosen, one of the other astronauts butts in and provides an answer, not giving the woman a chance to speak. At a later time, during the space flight, Lloyd Bridges suggests that her proper role is to stay at home, doing cooking and swing, and to bear children. Another one of the male astronauts comments on her scientific knowledge, dismissing it as ""women's intuition."" But the female astronaut is never fazed by this.

At any rate, the press conference features an intriguing blackboard demonstration as to the engineering aspects of the planned flight. Later, when the astronauts stand up and mingle in the crowd, a clever cinematographic technique is used. The camera segues from the conversation of one astronuaut (with a press reporter), to the next astronaut (as he is speaking with another reporter), and then to the next astronaut.

The ship takes off, and we are treated to many scenes where we can see the earth or the moon through portholes. There is also a clever scene where meteors can be seen whizzing dangerously close. These are done very convincingly, and we can clearly see the rocky boulders whizzing by. We are treated to a couple of scenes showing zero gravity. Although the astronauts never float around, we do see the seat belts floating about like snakes being charmed by a snake charmer. And we do see a harmonica slipping from an astronaut's hand and tumbling about before his eyes. The array of dials, flight indicators, switches, pipes, and tanks, on the rocket was done very well.

During the flight, Lloyd Bridges attempts sweet talk with the female astronaut. He talks about his adventures back on earth, in a convertible, and watching the moon. But the female astronaut maintains a cold exterior. But at the very end of the movie, they embrace.

The rocket experiences some sort of technical breakdown, and its course is changed, and it lands on Mars. The Martian scenery is very good (featuring some of the more picturesque spots from Death Valley in California). Now, there are two disappointments. The first disappointment, is that in one scene, the rocket looks like a German V-2 rocket. But in another scene, the rocket looks like a glistening futuristic mushroom -- a slender mushroom. This is an odd contradiction. The contradiction is that two very different representations of the rocket are shown.

The second disappointment, is that Martians are shown, but they are just people dressed in caveman suits. I liked the unique castle/fortresses that are on Mars. They are as good as the buildings shown in the Star Wars movies. But to repeat, the Martians are just people dressed like cavemen, who roam around and toss boulders from cliffs at the astronauts. A strange contradiction, is that the Martians are just cavemen who throw boulders, yet their houses look like the futuristic desert buildings found in the Star Wars movies.

ROCKETSHIP X-M does a good job at hanging together--it is a coherent movie--the plot does not meander into irrelevant or boring details. While the script is not especially clever, the periodic dismissive remarks directed against the female astronaut, and her maintenance of a focused attention to her job and refusal to be fazed, makes for an interesting movie (or anyway, a slightly interesting movie).

The soundtrack for ROCKETSHIP X-M is excellent, as there are many rhythms, textures, and nuances in the soundtrack. The music is by Ferde Grofe, composer of the famed Grand Canyon Suite fame. We frequently hear the theremin. Despite its occasional fine qualities, I would not recommend buying or even renting ROCKETSHIP X-M.

This movie has some parallels with DESTINATION MOON, a color sci-fi movie from the same era. DESTINATION MOON starts out with a press conference, just like ROCKETSHIP X-M. However, DESTINATION MOON lacks grit, it lacks interesting characters, it lacks tension. While reasonable minds might differ, I found DESTINATION MOON to be slow-moving. Although, I have owned DESTINATION MOON for a couple of years, I have only watched it once. I tried watching DESTINATION MOON a second time, but after 45 minutes, the tedium of this slow-moving film became overwhelming. On the plus side, anyone watching DESTINATION MOON can see that it was used as a template for the movie: 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY.

For fine sci-fi movies that scream out for repeated viewings, I recommend the following: ALIEN TRESPASS with Eric McCormack and Jenni Baird; MISSION TO MARS with Gary Sinise; TO SERVE MAN (Twilight Zone episode); THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL with Michael Rennie; and GALAXY QUEST with Tim Allen. For reasons unknown, I have been compelled to watched each of these particular films a half-dozen times over the past 10 years.",1255478400,3,5552,4.947424892703863

918836,3,6304680694,"By the time that ROCKETSHIP X-M was released in 1950, the western world had but recently been introduced to a type of rocket (the German ""Buzz Bomb"") that had suddenly and most uncomfortably transformed the notion of what a rocket was supposed to be. After having been hit on the head during the Blitz, Londoners could now see that rocketships were far more than the twirly cigar shapes of Buck Rogers.  Rockets were ""in"" and to be taken seriously. Director Kurt Neumann capitalized on this unexpected public interest in matters celestial in his tale of an abortive attempt by the United States to reach the moon.  Neumann was astute enough to recognize that his film could not be a celluloid version of a PhD thesis on interplanetary travel, so he loaded it with a variety of tried and true plot devices that today would be seen as lamentably politically incorrect. One of the leaders of the mission is Lloyd Bridges, who takes on the Handsome Leading Macho Man.  Bridges spends much screen time jockeying with the lovely Dr. Van Horn (Osa Massen), who is there mostly to be the Token Female.  Massen is on the receiving end of a number of anti-feminist jibes that suggest that females are not as mathematically competent as men.

The plot is fairly typical of the Hollywood stereotype on the Voyage to Unknown Lands.  As the ship takes off, there is the inevitable mechanical failure such that it misses the moon and hits Mars. At this point, the hard science that had dominated the production becomes soft as cheese. This is no surprise to moderns since, in all fairness to the film's writers, Neumann was trodding on new ground.  The crew walk on the surface of Mars wearing only oxygen masks, with no need of a pressurized suit.  As Arnold Schwarzenegger showed in TOTAL RECALL, even a momentary exposure to the thin atmosphere of Mars would result in some serious bodily distortions.  The film then adds an unexpected dimension to the expected inclusion of the ubiquitously found Lost Race.  Mars had been host to a high level of civilization populated by humanoids.  How Mars had engendered a parallel human evolution is a point that Neumann adroitly dodges.  This human culture had engaged in a ruinous nuclear war with the clear allegorical intent of presenting a warning to earth today.  The survivors had de-evolved into brutes much like those of the slightly later WORLD WITHOUT END. These savages had an interesting gender division. The women were all good looking females while the men were deformed mutants.  Much of the film's latter half is a mishmash of atomic moralizing mixed with some required bloodletting between the crew and the natives.

The acting was of a high order.  Hugh O'Brian of later Wyatt Earp fame, Noah Beery, and Morris Ankrum anchor some competent screen time.  The ending, of course, is a morose reminder of the dangers that await travelers to the Far Unknown.  ROCKETSHIP X-M is a fine transition piece between the childishness of the pre-WW II era and the far more serious undertones on the then looming Cold War seriousess of nuclear armeggeddon.  As such, it is, even now, a highly enjoyable movie.  Recommended.",1233964800,3,3156,4.8417132216014895

The story begins with a press conference -- only minutes before launch, where members of the press are first told of the secret plans to go to the moon, and introduced to the crew of four men and one woman. When a reporter asks about having a woman on the crew, expedition leader Dr. Karl Eckstrom (John Emery) explains that Dr. Lisa Van Horn (Osa Massen) is the best qualified person for the job as she is the chemist who developed the rocket fuel, which must be monitored closely during flight. The rest of the crew includes astronomer Harry Chamberlain (Hugh O'Brian), pilot Col. Floyd Graham (Lloyd Bridges), and engineer Maj. William Corrigan (Noah Beery Jr.).

The ship is launched, and after several maneuvers, each requiring a change in the fuel mixture, the ship successfully leaves Earth orbit and heads for the Moon. Once under way, however, the engines stop unexpectedly. A fuel problem is suspected, and Drs. Eckstrom and Van Horn begin a tedious pencil and paper recalculation of the fuel mixture. This is where trouble starts. When Dr. Van Horn finds a mistake in Dr. Eckstrom's calculations, he simply overrules her objections, chiding her for being an emotional female -- even though she is a chemist and the fuel expert.

When the engines are restarted with the new fuel mixture the thrust is so great the crew blacks out from acceleration. They regain consciousness days later to find they are now near Mars, having overshot the Moon by several million miles! Naturally, they decide to explore Mars while they are there. What they find is the ruins of an advanced civilization, evidently destroyed by nuclear war, and a few mutant savages. ""From the atomic age to the stone age"", Dr. Eckstrom observes sadly. After exploring the ruins they agree they must warn Earth of the dangers of atomic war, but are attacked by rock-throwing savages on their way back to the ship. I don't want to give away the ending, which will come as a surprise to many viewers, but not everyone makes it back.

To put this 1950 release into historical perspective: the first atom bomb was dropped in 1945, Sputnik was launched in 1957, John Glenn orbited the Earth in 1962, and the first manned Moon mission was not until 1969 -- almost 20 years after the film was made.

Rocketship X-M was made in the early days of the cold war and does not yet have the pro-military attitude so often seen in later films, where scientists were depicted as idealistic dreamers who must be kept in check by practical military men. In fact, it it quite clear that this is a civilian expedition, with Dr. Eckstrom in charge from beginning to end -- setting this film apart from run of the mill 50s space movies.

Many viewers have complained that the film portrays a typical 50s attitude toward women. I disagree. Dr. Lisa Van Horn is not a weak bimbo, nor does she wear dark rimmed glasses. She does not scream, even once, nor does she need to be rescued from anything. She is a competent scientist and crew member who fulfills her duties with ease. Rather, it is some of the male crew members, mainly Lloyd Bridges' pilot, who insist on treating her as ""a woman"". When the pilot talks about getting her under the moonlight, Lisa informs him that she already has moonlight experiences of her own. And remember, she was right about the fuel calculations!

Despite a low budget, the film's writing, acting, direction and photography are all at a high level of professionalism. Live action shot in a desert is combined effectively with studio matte shots to portray the Martian landscape. The use of sepia toning (reddish brown) is a clever way of differentiating Martian scenes from the rest of the black and white film. The science is way off -- there seems to have been little effort to get it right, but that does not detract from the otherwise high level of story telling. The characters are believable, if somewhat stereotyped -- the folksy Texan, for example.

This well made, thought provoking film belongs in the collection of everyone interested in 1950s science fiction films. The print used to master the DVD (Image Entertainment) is clear and sharp, and the sound is fine.",1222128000,5,4424,4.766318537859008
918915,4,6304680694,"This film beat the more highly publicized Destination Moon into the theatres in 1950 and thus kicked off the tidal wave of science-fiction movies that followed. It may not have been as realistic as the latter, but it was sure as heck a lot more fun. Despite some really hokey dialog and wildly improbable developments (aim for the moon, but hit Mars!), Rocketship does what every good movie should-- it holds interest throughout.

The opening scene is especially impressive with its well-stocked news conference and especially the booming countdown to blast-off. Already there's an air of thrills to come. Sure, the characters are a collection of movie stereotypes-- the jet jockey (Bridges), the likable yokel (Beery Jr.), the sexy scientist (Massen), the stern chief (Emery), and the rather unsteady engineer (O' Brien). Nonetheless, each is played with conviction, and in a real casting coup, there's the lordly Morris Ankrum back at command central.

Lippert Pictures was a budget-minded company to put it kindly. Thus it's to producer-writer-director Kurt Neumann's credit that he gets so much out of the material. Note the early scene where the crew climbs up to the control compartment. The opening shot of the rocketship interior could have simply placed the crew already in that central compartment and saved money. But it doesn't. Instead Neumann has the crew climb through the rather impressive guts of the ship, thereby creating a more believable and eye-catching transport. It's touches like this that help compensate for the occasional triteness.

Speaking of touches, how well I remember audience reaction to the Martian girl when she opened her eyes to reveal two blanks. The audience let out a collective shriek. Of course, that was 1950, and still a long time before today's super-sophisticated special effects. But I doubt if any of today's effects produced a stronger reaction than those two all-white lenses. (Question-- is that lipstick I see on the girl in this 1976 enhanced version?)

There's also a subtle subtext in the movie's latter half. 1949 was the year the Soviets first tested an atomic bomb, thus establishing the possibility of the Cold War going nuclear. Note the pointed comments crew members make about the destructive potential of radioactivity once they discover its effects on the Martian civilization. That would appear to be writer Neumann making some timely observations on a menace then beginning to emerge. On a similar note, Ankrum's closing insistence that space exploration must proceed despite an ill-fated first effort is years ahead of its time, and likely the first such declaration in the movies or any other popular medium. Then too, it was rather gutsy to crash the survivors on their way back to Earth. That unhappy ending warned audiences of the human cost that exploration would inevitably take.

Setting aside the strictly commercial aspects (the hokey romance, for one), the movie does a lot better than would normally be expected of a Lippert production, becoming rather prophetic in its own modest way. I think that's one reason for both the movie's cult status and general durability long after most  contemporaries have faded away. I can't say that whatever changes the 1976 enhancements made on the original print are that noticeable on my new copy. But, then again, maybe that's a good thing. Rocketship X-M remains a minor milestone to this day.",1206748800,9,3414,5.142342342342342

918917,4,6304680694,"Ferde Grofe, certainly one of the best known American symphonic composers, was hired to write the music score for ROCKETSHIP X-M.  He was paid $1500 to turn in what may be the best sci-fi score for the movies.  When you watch the film, tune in to the heroic main title (which is repeated, in part, later), the ""weightless"" sound in certain scenes, the romantic theme for Floyd and Lisa, and the eerie sound as the crew discovers they are headed for Mars.  After the landing, Grofe uses part of some music he wrote for his ""Symphony in Steel,"" and combines it with the use of the Theremin to create an unworldly sound indeed.  On the trip back, the solar opera aspect of this movie is emphasized with the music setting the exact mood it should do for the tragedies encountered.  This is a great score, worthy of re-recording in today's sound.

And, if you want to hear another score Grofe wrote for the same studio (Lippert) in 1950, get a copy of THE RETURN OF JESSE JAMES, another worthy listen.",1177977600,5,996,4.5055555555555555
918918,4,6304680694,"If you listen to the music for the movie it sounds like a grand adventure is taking place and then it all ends on a crash of sour notes.  What do I mean?  Well, they embark on the grand adventure of being the first ones to take ship for the moon--and wind up on mars.  On their way back they crash...just like the music.  I liked it.  It shows just how serious people took the possibilitly of space flight back in the early fiftys.

PROS:

1.  None of the attempted indept characterization you usually get in todays movies where you have fifty main characters and only two hours to tell each ones' story--they use that for filler today, somebody told those
hacks in Hollywood it was good writing.  No, 77 minutes of short, sweat, and to the point.  They do use characterization but they don't use it as filler.

2.  An interesting idea and the actors are acting.

3.  The required meteor swarm--all science fiction movies seem to have them.  I seem to remember they put them in because they really didn't know what else bad could happen to you up there.  (Just remember, I didn't say Heinlein wrote this.)

4.  Through a twist or two of fate they wind up making a landing on Mars.  By the way, its starts raining when they stop.  I think someone should have muttered '...ionizing the atmosphere as we came down....' might have passed the pop science of the day.

5.  Another interesting thing was they discovered life on Mars and it had been destroyed by atomic wars.  The question was if a big meteor had smashed them...no everything is being radiated so it was war destroyed them.

six.  They find the destroyed remains of a civilization.  Interesting in that they pick up a few objects and look at them.  What were they...who knows?  You remember the time machine with Rod Taylor and how the spinning rings were a big interesting thing and help make the movie because they told of how it all happened.  Well, the artifacts are that kind of 'interesting'.  Too bad there were not more. I figured that first one they uncovered was a tomb stone.

7.  They find the remainder of the humanoid-like people of Mars.  The one who threw the ax and killed the scientiest appeared to still have blisters on his back and the girls is blind.  Obviously the dying remainder of the thousand year dead civilization still live close to their nuclear blasted cities.  I've got to tell you all, this is actually original stuff for hollywood.  Despite having rain, dry gulches that must sometimes have water, human like people, no space suits and a space ship capable of reaching Mars -- using chemical rockets-- but less than a hundred feet tall...it is still interesting.  I guess it's that short, sweat, and to the point thing.

I don't think I'll tell you any more and ruin it for you.

CONS:

1.  Humm.  I don't find movies that are dead serious cheezy or campy...this movie is 'dead serious'.

Therefore, I give this movie five stars because they tried hard to make it a serious movie with limited facts about the surface of Mars.  The actors did a fine job, the idea is fine and interesting and carried out seriously.  No, I don't think more money would have helped.  No, they need more information about space, acceleration, and the surface of Mars.
All sins are forgiven, it is a fine movie and should be view as science fiction drama.  No popcorn this time...I think I'll read the bible.

I meant to give it five stars, not four--thanks Karen!

After watching the movie however, I was a little disappointed.  It wasn't as entertaining as I had expected.  The script was average and the storyline dragged on in spots.  ""Rocketship X-M"" has a likeable cast, though, and the special effects were good, considering the low budget.

If you can go along with that much, you might enjoy this artifact of the 1950s. It's not so much a movie as a series of stereotypes strung together. The rocket's instrument panel would be familiar to anyone who had seen cockpit panels in WWII movies, right down to the artificial horizon (relative to what?) and airspeed indicator, despite lack of air. There are a few zero-G scenes, but weightlessness seems to apply only to objects and not to people. Mars itself is a lot like Earth, but with a Theremin and an orange filter. And that poor leading lady - she could be a woman or a scientist, but not both at once.

Broad stereotypes and bad science, what a combination. If you've got a rainy afternoon some time, pop the popcorn and go ahead. They just don't make them like this anymore - and that may be a good thing.

918922,5,6304680694,"The basic story here is four guys and a woman (scientists and mechanics and a pilot) blast-off in a space rocket to go to the moon for scientific purposes - and just plain adventure. That's all i'm going to say about the plot.

Now remember Rocketship X-M was made/released in theatres in 1950 - a year before 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' came out in 1951.

So Rocketship X-M was one of the very first movies to set the stage for this truly wonderful and remarkable era for the science-fiction world.

Forget that half the science in this film is now outdated (along with certain remarks by Col. Floyd Graham on Dr. Lisa Van Horn) - nevertheless at the time this movie had a hard science mentality to it. But more importantly Rocketship X-M has a feel and look to it (in black & white) that is really cool, not to mention good characters and a very interesting turn in the story - an almost mystical side to it (without being too heavy-handed about it).

And about the ""woman"" issue - well, to me it's actually how the film itself treats Dr. Lisa Van Horn (played by the wonderful Osa Massen). Just to have a woman in the year 1950 aboard a space ship as a vital intelligent member in the first place is quite remarkable. It does so with respect - showing her as actively part of the crew and a very intelligent and competent scientist. Col. Floyd Graham (played by Lloyd Bridges) despite his old fashened remarks shows by his actions nothing but respect and trust in her actual abilities.

To me 1950s sci-fi movies are amoung the best - this would include such films as 'Earth vs. the Flying Saucers', 'Forbidden Planet' and the above mentioned 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'.",1139270400,36,1682,4.483660130718954
918923,2,6304680694,"""Rocketship X-M"" was released on June 2nd, 1950, beating the premier of ""Destination Moon"" by a little more than three weeks.  Kurt Neumann is the producer, director, and credited with the writing of this film.  The fact that publicity surrounding ""Destination Moon"" was the cause of ""Rocketship X-M"" being rushed into production, some similarity in storyline between the movies, and the fact that the two movies are the start of the sci-fi ""craze"" of the 1950's leads to inevitable comparison between the two films.

""Rocketship X-M"" had less than 1/6th the budget of ""Destination Moon"", and was black & white as opposed to color, although they used a reddish tint for the scenes on Mars (Sepia Color) which was effective in differentiating the scenes on Earth and the ship from those on Mars.  The idea of a trip to the Moon is the base for both movies, but ""Rocketship X-M"" diverges in the storyline from there, and so while comparisons of the rockets, the takeoffs, and crew members with harmonicas exist in both movies, the differences do outweigh the similarities.

The last comparison is how the two movies handle the science aspect, and ""Rocketship X-M"" is clearly inferior in every way to ""Destination Moon"" in this aspect.  They do attempt to show the effects of the g-force liftoff, but then despite dialogue which indicates that they are still accelerating at a tremendous rate, the g-force is no longer present.  To make matters worse, they have occasional items (e.g., jacket, harmonica, wrenches) start floating around, while the crew remains standing firmly upright.  Only one line from Lloyd Bridges indicates that he feels lighter to indicate a lack of gravity.  On the other hand, if they really were still accelerating, then there should have been gravity for everyone and everything and things should not have randomly started floating in the air.

On the positive side, ""Rocketship X-M"" gets the adventure story started almost immediately.  The movie opens with a press conference which is taking place just a few minutes prior to launch, which sets the stage for the rest of the movie.  The crew is then quickly underway on their adventure.  They encounter problems with a near collision with their tail section once it is released, their fuel mix, passing through some meteorites, and then finally an attempt to maneuver their ship results in the crew becoming unconscious and the ship hurtling into space.

The ship scenes do drag a bit, and the viewer is distracted by bad science.  The dialogue is ridiculous and insulting at times, and the characters are rather two-dimensional during the first part of the film.  Once the crew recovers consciousness and finds themselves nearing Mars, the movie does get much better.  It is on Mars where the anti-war message of the movie comes loud and clear, and the surprise ending on the return to Earth also is a plus.

Even with a relatively strong finish, I do find it difficult to recommend this movie to anyone other than those who like the 1950's science fiction films.  It was nominated for the Retro Hugo for Dramatic Presentation in 2001 for the year 1950, but lost out to ""Destination Moon"".  It also is of interest, because it was written, in part, by blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo who is not credited for his efforts.

As for the DVD itself, the film is in pretty good shape, but it is a bare bones DVD.  The only extra is the trailer for the movie, and there are not even subtitles.  I am also worried about the fact that some scenes have enhanced special effects, but since I have never sent the original I cannot say if they are good or bad.  In general, I am opposed to movies being altered beyond a simple restoration.  It would have been nice if there were a feature included to talk about the making of this movie, as well as the political and social environment of the time.",1132963200,7,3863,4.7990936555891235

The mars part with it's red background over the black and white picture and the eeerie ""alien/space music"" in the background with the martians seen mostly as shadows in the background left to our imaginations, scared me as a little boy.

The science of this movie by our day is not so much childish, corny and cheesy but rather outdated.  It is farfetched now (alright, VERY farfetched....and amusing to notice) but good for what people knew about space at the time the movie was written in 1950.  It has a mature storyline about sending the first manned mission into space over 10 years before it actually happened.  And a good story it is.  The producers, in their story, use realistic equipment for what they thought would really be needed in space.  Not ray guns or cheesy multicolored space suites or robots with gagets and gears turning and popping all over it but realistic space suites to protect you from harsh environment or oxygen masks and tanks to provide air in an inhospitable atmosphere or the need to lose the boosters off a spaceship once it gets you off the ground

In comparison, this movie, as as story and it's characters, I would say is far better than say Space Cowboys with all it's showing off CGI as Clint Eastwood and James Garner (acting like two comical dirty old men if I remember right) play the Dukes of Hazzard drag racing in a moon buggy all over a CGI icy comet.

Let's first be fair to Destination Moon: it was conceived first, produced first, and is by far a superior achievement in the realm of science-fiction/fact.  But Neumann and Lippert Studios hurried through production a similar story line about the first spaceship to the moon, then decided to extrapolate a storyline that threw the ship off course, sending it tragically to Mars.

This is where I prefer the story line.  We briefly see a world that is desolated by a past Nucleor Holocaust, the wrecked cities radiated, and the mutated survivors no more than violent cavemen.  The story moves quickly, and is put together like a Jules Verne novel, where the science is slightly hokey, but with a little tongue-in-cheek attitude, believable enough to keep us hanging on.  Though all the astronauts are politically incorrect, we still like them.

919011,4,6304680694,"Rocketship X-M was really one of the first good science fiction films of the 1950s, and its influence can be seen in the slew of space movies released throughout that decade.  In some ways, it is the quintessential science fiction film of the era; it sends a crew of four men and one woman into space for the first time, and these characters actually get a chance to express their own personalities during the journey.  While the science of the film misses the mark in a number of ways, the filmmakers did not rely on alien ""monsters"" to help the story along.  The movie has a message, and its plausibility and rather unhappy conclusion bring that message home to viewers.  The film also reflects to some degree the culture of the time in terms of gender, sporting a number of chauvinistic lines sure to rankle many modern viewers.
Our intrepid crew for this secret first manned spaceship launch consists of ship designer Dr. Exum (John Emery), navigator Floyd Graham (Lloyd Bridges), engineer Major William Corrigan (Noah ""Rockford's Dad"" Beery, Jr.), some less important guy played by Hugh O'Brian, and brilliant female chemist Dr. Lisa Van Horn (Osa Massen).  When Floyd isn't navigating, he's putting the moves on the cold and aloof Lisa.  Things go swimmingly at first (with the ship, not with Lloyd's advances), but then a problem with the fuel mixture (sure - blame the woman) causes the engines to die.  When Dr. Van Horn defends her computations, she is treated to a few chauvinistic remarks about acting like a woman; the great and mighty men figure things out on their own, and before you know it everyone is knocked unconscious and the Rocketship X-M (which was supposed to land on the moon) finds itself flung out into deep space.  As luck would have it, though, they wake up to find themselves within reach of Mars and take advantage of the opportunity to land there.  This is a Lippert film, so you knew there would have to be many scenes of people climbing hills and mountains somewhere in it.  Well, the crew members make a few discoveries about the state of past and current life on the red planet and try to make it back home to spread the word to the people of earth - it's your basic nuclear was is bad kind of advice.  The ending is not a happy one by any means, but it does serve to further man's (or at least science fiction script writers') determination to explore outer space.
There's nothing fancy at all about this movie, yet it really does deliver the type of message a science fiction film should carry.  Along with the science, weak as it turned out to be in places, and a ""scientific moral"" to the story, we actually get to see characterization come to life before our very eyes (especially in terms of Floyd and Lisa).  I think this 1950 film deserves to be called a classic in its field, and it still has much to offer all fans of science fiction.",1075507200,55,2882,4.572815533980583
919012,5,6304680694,"Wonderful film, typical of the genre. Less otimistic than the George Pal efforts, but effective for its capture of human fears facing the unknown.
The DVD edition is a great release, substantially cleaning up the images from the VHS release. In fact, the first scene on Mars (showing the rocket and the astronauts egressing) appears to be a different cut than used in the VHS edition.  Finally, the ""sepia color"" effect of the scenes on Mars are effectively used. Once again, Death Valley really makes a great backdrop for Mars (as it also did for ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" some 15 years later).",1073779200,3,595,4.776699029126213

Wade Williams Collections, Corinth Films and Image Entertainment have produced this movie and another like it, (Destination Moon) which I purchased, and neither of them are captioned.
Having recently lost my hearing, I depend on Closed Captioning for nearly everything on TV or video. Therefore, these old classics which I wanted for my own are worthless in their present condition.",1064707200,5,566,5.230769230769231
919014,4,6304680694,"This triple feature has something for everyone. First, ""Devil Girl From Mars"" (worth having for the title alone) involves some pub owners, an escaped convict, a kid, his mum, and some scientists, as they match wits with the bodacious devil grrrrl! She has a weird ship, a cheesey robot, and a cool leather outfit! She wants a man to take back to Mars for breeding purposes. Who wouldn't go?? ""Monster From Green Hell"" is an epic slab of moldy limburger, starring J.R. Ewing's daddy (on Dallas) Jim Davis. It seems we've sent a rocket full of wasps (???!) into space, only to have them crash, mutate into giants, and start eating folks in ""Green Hell"" Africa. Only Jim Davis can save us! The ""monsters"" were snatched from some poor kid's toybox for sure! Enjoyable for it's pure schlock-factor. ""Rocketship X-M"" Yes, it's Lloyd Bridges as you've never seen him before! He heads a crew on a mission to the moon that goes awry. The ship goes off coarse and heads toward Mars instead! Who knew that Mars was inhabited by cavemen? I was hoping for more devil women!! You'll recognize lots of the cast from other movies like ""Kronos"", and from the '70s TV hit ""Rockford Files"" (Jim Rockford's dad). A nice little diversion...",1057708800,8,1219,4.700934579439252
