7939149,5,B00005JHYO,"I saw this series when it first aired in the US, which I believe was around 1999.  Although medical science and photography has advanced since this show was made, this series remains my all-time most memorable on the subject of human biology.  I remember it vividly, despite the fact that I only saw it once and I was 13 at the time!

The series covers all the  major areas of human development, from conception to death.  It is highly medically accurate, and used what was for its time cutting-edge film techniques.  It manages to treat sensitive and sometimes controversial topics with compassion, humor, and above all a sense of beauty.  Robert Winston strikes the perfect tone.

My only wish for this series is that it would become available in other DVD regions, as I live in North America and don't own a region-free DVD player.  I very much wish I could watch it again!",1338422400,,876,4.636363636363637
7939150,5,B00005JHYO,I live in Switzerland and have viewed several of Professor Robert Winston's shows on the BBC.  He is quite entertaining in his presentation of very fascinating subjects concerning the human body and mind.  I am always glued to the TV when his series' are on.  He has given me educational food for thought. I highly recommend anything that he has done.,1196035200,,351,4.721311475409836
