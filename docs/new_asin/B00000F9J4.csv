Then, wanting a better tape, I ordered it because this is one of my favorites which always leaves me with a good feeling and smiling when it's over.  The two families involved are wheat harvesters working the big wheat fields in the heartland.  There is a competitiveness that gets a little out of control adding to the drama of
their hard working life style.  There is plenty of nail-biting situations, but all ends well.  The characters are great.  You don't forget them immediately once the movie is over.  And best of all, no blood, guts, and gore and filthy language.",1388275200,,639,4.552631578947368
7907470,5,B00000F9J4,"This movie shows both the heartache and pride that farmers in the Midwest experience. You couldn't ask for a more realistic and heart-wrenching movie. It's over 20 years old and stories just like it still play out on farms across America. If I could give this movie 10 stars, I would. Get it when you can find it. We were so happy that they finally released it in 2000. We had taped it off of CBS and had worn the tape to shreds. We purchased 10 copies. Highly recommended!",1248048000,,473,4.325842696629214
7907471,5,B00000F9J4,'nough said - one of the greatest custom combining movies ever.  Probably one of the only ones too...but it still brings tears to my eyes when I see the combine derby.,1228003200,,167,4.387096774193548
7907472,1,B00000F9J4,"This is a really great movie, unavailable on DVD.  I'm sure that's why there seem to many cheap copies being sold on Amazon.  This tape is valued at $50.  If you see it for sale at less than $40, be sure to read the description carefully.  Bootleggers rarely use the words 'authentic' or 'original'.  Also beware if all of the seller's titles come with 'artwork cut to fit hardcase'.  You should email the seller specifically to ask whether their tape is authentic or a copy.  Click on 'customer images' to see how to identify a bootleg so you don't get ripped off like I was!",1224028800,2,576,4.428571428571429
7907473,5,B00000F9J4,This is the best movie around.  I hadn't ever heard of it and my husband had mentioned something about so I researched it and found the movie.  He was on a custom cutting crew for 2 years. His family also farms. It portrayed what the american farmer goes through and how tuff life can be for them.  I loved the movie and recomend it to anyone who is thinking about buying it.  I even enjoyed when they were cutting with the very same combines that we still cut wheat with today.  We have even participated in a combine demo derby....so we could releate to evey part of this movie!  If I could give it more stars I would. Just AWESOME.,1159833600,,634,4.241666666666666
7907474,5,B00000F9J4,"As the previous viewers stated, This is a great movie and the lives that farmers and their famalies live everyday. Having lived on a farm all my life in West Texas, and my dad and uncles Custom Harvesting cotton in South and West Texas and then seeing this movie made feel feel that the director and the cast really must have done some serious research and investagating to have written such a great sory and pick such a great cast for this epic movie in my mind. For the people who have never been on a farm that have never seen this movie, trust me it will make you feel that you too are part of an American Heritage and you can't help but have compassion for the Greatest Life that a person could live. I wish all of the bureaucrats in Washington could watch this movie and come to realize that this is exactly how our farmers live everyday and come up with a plan to support our great growers instead of tieing their hands behind their backs and to stop importing so much that we as Americans can provide to others thus improving the lives of our own famalies.",1129420800,,1064,4.298507462686567
7907475,5,B00000F9J4,"Wowa!  If you don't live on a farm or have never been around one, you should really watch this movie, to actually get the feel of what they go through.  I have lived on a farm my whole life and harvest is always the most hectic time of year... Just watch this movie and you will know what I mean!  When this movie came on tv back in 1987, I was just 1 year old, but my brother and dad recorded it and they watch it over and over and over!!!  I just pre-ordered it, so i really hope i can get one so they can have a real copy of it!  American Harvest - there's just no other name for it.  Farming is tough work and many people take it for granted...  If I would have been able to have rated this a 10 Star movie, then i would have!!  It's the real thing!  :)",1056240000,4,757,3.801282051282051
7907476,5,B00000F9J4,"This movie is so incredible.  ""Race Against The Harvest"" is so comparable to what it's really like out there trying to make a living as a custom cutter.  The struggles that Duncan and his crew went through  are just like the real thing.  It's movies like this that make people understand what harvesting is really all about and the hardships that the crews go through!  I only wish that more people have heard of this movie to understand!",1027900800,2,438,4.564102564102564
7907477,5,B00000F9J4,"THIS MOVIE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF FARM LIFE AND HOW FARMERS NEED TO TURN TO EACH OTHER WHEN TIMES AREN'T GOING WELL AND HOW YOUR WORST NEIGHBOR CAN BECOME THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN SAVE YOU IN YOUR TIMES OF DESPAIR.  VERY TOUCHING, AND A MUST FOR ALL FARMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO WATCH. THIS MOVIE SHOWS THE JOYS OF FARMING AND THE DESPERATE TIMES THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH IN THIS INDUSTRY.  I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE WHOLEHEARTEDLY!!!",970704000,9,433,4.468354430379747
