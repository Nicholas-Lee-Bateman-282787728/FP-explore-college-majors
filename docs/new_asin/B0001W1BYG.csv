8016867,1,B0001W1BYG,"I only purchased this movie because parts of it were shot in my hometown of Beebe, Arkansas when I was a kid.  It was nothing short of terrible!  The acting was laughable and at times actually painful to watch.  The quality of the sound and picture were the worst I have ever seen on any DVD.  Really, that's about the only thing that made the whole experience bearable.  I'm sure if I could have heard all of the dialogue it would have been even worse.  Don't waste your money!",1392681600,,478,4.314606741573034

8016869,5,B0001W1BYG,"What a charming piece of 100% American nostalgia!  This movie takes  us back, indeed, to the ""B-Grade"", weekend drive-in movies. Under the direction of Harry Thomason, we see former pro-football star turned ""actor"", Alex Karis (remember Blazin' Saddles?).  Could this be the movie that inspired the Burt Reynolds, Jerry Reed, Jackie Gleason classic Smokey and the Bandit?  The movie is smartly set in the beautiful town of Beebe, Arkansas (rated as America's most ""Rockwellian"" representative city).  Don't miss a chance to turn back time with this near lost treasure...fire up your grill, pop-a-top, pop some corn and enjoy!!!!",1248393600,,628,5.36734693877551
8016870,5,B0001W1BYG,"HOw can I start this this. I love this movie its so much fun. The acting is terrible on the one hand but great on the other. For people who don't know this movie has gone under a few title including Redneck County,The Hardheads,The Hootch County Boys,The Great Lester Boggs and Lester Boggs. The basic story is Malcom leaves New York to discover the world the best way possible through experience along the way he meets Leroy whom he saves from a gang of bikers. Malcom and Leroy are then saved from the bikers by Lester Boggs in his byplane. A rediculouse story yes but very fun. Filled with lovable characters most notably Lester Boggs played by the great Bob Ridgely. I almost guarentee you'll find this movie a great as I did yes its cheesy but the characters a very lovable and fun. Check it out if you like car crash,moonshine style movie.",1127692800,3,845,4.4935064935064934
