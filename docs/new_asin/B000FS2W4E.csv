8125890,5,B000FS2W4E,My six year old daughter loves this dvd. She saw an advertisement for Princess Natasha on another dvd and she was hooked. The segments are very short so it's easy to watch a few and then do something else. I would say that hearing the theme song and the intro. to the show repeatedly for every episode is a bit annoying. Princess Natasha is a girl adolescent hero and the show doesn't take itself too seriously.,1235865600,,411,4.421052631578948
8125891,3,B000FS2W4E,"Originally develped by Cartoon Network as an offering on AOL's KOL kids service webisode series, this series is now avaialble on dvd.  Unlike Kim Possible which can be enjoyed by both adults and children, this is aimed at children alone. The animation is simple as are the plots and characters. Each episode is 7 minutes, indicating its ""webisode"" nature. That said, the children (10 or younger) who are the target audience may find it entertaining.  Episodes deal lightly with self-esteem, crushes, etc. in a pre-teen manner.  The bottom-line is: If you or the kids you're buyng it for like it on AOL, go for it.  If not, try before you buy.",1163376000,2,642,4.756756756756757
