7944374,5,B00005LP41,Funny Awesome Cool. Recommended for anyone 13 to any age. Good for teens who ever find themselves in a difficult love situation.,1141516800,3,128,4.863636363636363
7944375,2,B00005LP41,"well, just looking at the cover you might see to half naked females makeing out, it was for this reason that i bought this anime. i thought it was lesbian hentai, but it is NOT! I would describe it best as a comidy with a hint of fan service. the picture on the cover comes from one of the characters dreams, the two girls really never even touch. so if your lookin for a bit of a laugh then go ahead and buy this, if your lookin for hentai, take your money elsewhere.",1140048000,26,468,4.043010752688172
7944376,5,B00005LP41,"If you are not in to Japanese animation sex comedies, (see this so you can live every once in a while don't be such a old hang or a stick in the mud). Now moving on, if you do like hentai then get this video. It's funny, sexy, and kind of sweet too. The heroine, Chizuru, is as big-breasted as they come. If they make another strange love video I hope they have Chizuru working at ""Hooters""",1127001600,3,390,4.077922077922078
7944377,5,B00005LP41,"This is a cute anime featuring good looking characters put in interesting circumstances. The first episode is about a teacher who tries to win a chance to have sex with his student. She plays him like a fiddle and he misses out. In the next episode she falls in love with a girl and has to struggle with the idea of being a lesbian and also how to get this girl to fall in love with her in return. It's a very entertaining anime but I would really like to have more than two episodes on this DVD. I don't know if there were only two made in the series or not though. If not, there should be more made.",1032825600,47,601,4.016666666666667
7944378,3,B00005LP41,"Some nudity and some sex scenes (on the high end of R rated, definitely not a kid's movie unless you know your kids know all about sex), but in general this is an anime soap opera, a romantic-triangle fling with the girl and her boy friend and her wanna-be lover and a girl she connects with. Lots of talk, lots of boy-and-girl meeting and discussing. Would appeal perhaps to people who enjoy soap operas and aren't adverse to the very occasional nude or sex. Action, humor, etc? Nope.",1018569600,36,485,4.5227272727272725
7944379,3,B00005LP41,"From the back cover:

Busty and beautiful Yoshida is the sexiest coed in her class.  She's got the attention of her professor, who wants her for some very special extracurricular activities.  But how will he-and her rock star boyfriend-react to being dumped for another woman?

Well that's the basic jist of this two episode anime.  She spends the first episode teasing her teacher, who poor guy never gets anything but a night handcuffed to a table out of her, and having sex with her boyfriend.  Then she spends the other episode falling in love with a younger girl. While funny at times, it was also very strange; it leaves many unanswered questions.  But to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure I want to know the answers to them.

It is rated 16+ for a lot of nudity, sex, and some language.",1017014400,43,795,4.510489510489511
7944380,5,B00005LP41,"This is a very good movie folks, but you want to know the strange part?! Naoko Takeuchi is the creator of this movie! Compaired to Sailor Moon, it's WAY differnt, but also A LOT BETTER in it's own way, WARNING THOUGH, there is nudity and part that are NOT for little kids, I mean look at the cover of this movie! LoL, but anyway if your 13 or over it's good and I know you'll love it!",995500800,7,384,4.0
