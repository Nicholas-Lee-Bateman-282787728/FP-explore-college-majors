2597396,3,B000G1IZF0,"The NANA movie was mildly entertaining, but mostly because I'm a huge fan of the anime and it is interesting to see the characters portrayed in live-action. The movie is lacking the substance that the anime has. There is a lot left out of the movie, plot differences, and the movie also ends very abruptly when there's so much more story to be told! Also, the live-action movie is a lot less funny and dramatic; it doesn't draw you and inspire you to feel emotions the way the anime does.

If you are a fan of the anime then the live-action is worth watching, otherwise don't bother! If you have seen the live-action movie and not the anime, PLEASE PLEASE watch the anime! Trust me on this!! The anime doesn't span the full manga series, but you can pick up in the manga where it leaves off. Unfortunately, due to the author's illness, the manga is on hiatus and leaves you hanging; but it's still worth reading.

To the reviewer who said that the movie portrays women as submissive and housewives: That is ridiculous! The only thing that could be conceived as submissive is when NANA (Hachi) cleans Shouji's apartment and that's because that is just how she is! The other NANA (from Black Stones) is an aggressive, fiery woman that doesn't take anyone's crap!  She's far from submissive and no one has a problem with that! It doesn't suggest that dreaming is a bad thing for a woman either. I feel you have an entirely wrong impression and maybe if you watch the anime you'll understand the story better.",1180656000,5,1505,4.566666666666666
2597397,1,B000G1IZF0,The english language subtitles do not work on the copy of this dvd I purchased.,1175299200,,79,4.333333333333333
2597398,5,B000G1IZF0,"This is a coming of age story set around two 20-year-old women living in Tokyo, trying to find themselves in a world of possiblities and all the while learning about love and their own limitations. I must say that after watching this film on a long journey home from a year abroad, I found the story very relatable and poignant.
I read one of the reviews and I have to set the record straight and divulge my own opinion because I do not agree in the slightest to the accusation that women are portrayed as submissive, and if you watch this film I am sure you will agree it is quite the opposite! For people who have not already seen this movie and are planning to, there might be some spoilers ahead (but what I have to say might just sway you into wanting to pick up a copy).
First off, Osaki Nana (played be Mika) is incredibly strong! She copes silently with the pain of having let go of the love of her life in order to pursue her own life goals, and in that way is courageous.  She is never demonized for her decision, and in fact is respected for her talent, tenacity, confidence, and strong will to succeed through writing her own music (rather than riding the coat-tails of her successful boyfriend who sold-out to a pop band!)
By nature, the other Nana played by Aoi is more naive about the ways of life and through inexperience, believes that a woman should sacrifice for her beau, only to discover through later heartbreak that she would like to make her own mark on the world and admires the other Nana for having found her true calling.  I highly recommend seeing NANA for yourself and if you visit the fansite, you can view trailers and clips.
In addition, I find the cinematography and time-sequencing of shots effectively communicates a story of innocence with an adult edge.
I believe that the first reviewer may have misinterpreted the message being given by this film, for it truly packs a punch of girl power (and I can honestly say my male friends have loved it as well!)
In my view, it is impossible not to notice the urgings of one Nana to another to stand on her own feet and create her OWN destiny in order to find true happiness; love falls into place only after you have paid attention to your dreams.

*On a side note (SPOILER), despite the view of Junko that Nana (Aoi) was partially at fault for a sticky break-up, her former lover Shoji is STILL given blame for his betrayal in the relationship! Watch it again reviewer number one!",1153180800,23,2462,4.442477876106195
2597399,3,B000G1IZF0,"NANA, which is based on the popular manga series of the same name, stars pop megastar Mika Nakashima and Aoi Miyazaki each as a girl named NANA who have a chance meeting on a train and become great friends.  Mika's NANA is not so strong and silent which gives her character a 3D human feel.  The acting is good and the story is decent.  The music is way better than the movie, but it's not rock, its catchy hook-filled pop.  What's the problem?  The problem with this movie is how women are represented.  They are made to be submissive, and housewives.  They are told that when their boyfriends cheat, it's their fault; when relationships don't work out, its because the girl didn't try hard enough; when a woman has dreams for herself, its not good and it makes her unlovable.  Besides that backwards thinking, the movie also never fully captures the viewer's heartstrings.  The movie has a lot going for it, but in the end it's all show.",1152748800,,939,4.541666666666667

heart warming drama. Through this movie, U can see through

She already has 4 platinum albums &  after this "" NANA"",

stablized herself  even as a popular actress.

She looks so fragile & so vulnurable but rocks.

If U ever had the chance to hear her biggest hit single

mood of Japanese own style sad feelin' soul.

All the Asians share the same  kinda feelin' through this type

of mood & melody. It's very different from American

2597404,2,B000G1IZF0,"Maybe they're just fans of the manga or the anime. It's a good thing I have seen neither. I can freely judge this as a ""movie"".

 Nana a story about two girls of the same name that are complete opposites who coincidentally happen to bump into each other on a train traveling to Tokyo. Both of these girls are starting their new lives and taking a bet on their future. After parting later on they by chance meet each other again and end up renting a room together.

That's the better part of the Movie.

Next the plot kicks in and is as cheesy as it can get. NANA #1 The rocker (I call her #1 since we get introduced to her first) has aspirations of reforming,reviving, or whatever it is she's trying to do with her band. The movie really contradicts itself on what exactly NANA 1's goal is with her band. At first it's made to seem as though she quit singing and doesn't want to sing after one of her band members brings her a new song and she is reluctant about singing it. Then the explanation for her and her band coming to Tokyo is to boost her career as a singer and their image as a band. The only problem their band had is that they needed a new base player. As simple as that was, they couldn't seem to get her story straight on just what her personal goal was in relation to her band. Eventually the entire idea of her band making songs and taking on gigs takes a back seat to her love troubles.

I guess that maybe there's something that didn't translate from the manga/anime to the movie well.

NANA #2 (the one we are introduced to second of course) came to Tokyo to be closer to her bf. She has no job and no goals really except for getting married and being a housewife apparently. Eventually her bf becomes interested in another girl that is more independent. She has a job (working with him), and goals(to be an artist)not to mention she has a cute voice and looks 20 times better than Nana. Can you blame him really? I didn't. I actually wanted the movie to be about them instead seemed much more interesting. Anyway NANA #2 doesn't do much but try to find a job,get yelled at, and act like a 16 year old. Outside of having her heart broken she's just acting support for NANA #1 as the movie mostly focuses on her.

Both of the NANA's apparently seem to be suffering from Heartache but both for their own reasons. NANA #1 apparently knew that her bf or ex bf? was leaving for Tokyo to get a chance at stardom in a major band. Nana #1 decided she didn't want to go with him after he offered because she wanted to be in her own spotlight. So after he starts playing for the new band after leaving the ""Black Stones"" he become her object of hate. I didn't really understand that part. SHE let him go and turned him down and now she's upset at him? Huh? The band was apparently ready to separate as everyone had their own goals but they decided to stay together as a band (not implied exactly but shown in the movie as they all end up going to Tokyo and doing gigs) except for Ren. Everyone encouraged him and stood behind him to leave. It wasn't a betrayal it was him taking on an opportunity that he was open about with them. So why is he the bad guy? When he didn't do anything wrong.

That's really what makes the movie so odd. Nana 2 has a reason to be upset because her bf cheated on her. Nana 1 on the other hand doesn't have a reason to be upset. Her bf did everything for her and basically wanted her to be like his wife but she rejected him. So she's upset because of what? Her own selfishness? Him taking advantage of a better opportunity when the band was in the process of separating? Really didn't make any sense.

The movie pretty much plays around this drama and NANA 1's ego and whatever she is upset about that she thinks Ren did wrong? I don't know maybe asking her to come with him and that he would take care of her and spend his life together with her made her angry or something.

Overall this movie pretty much was a dud. Truthfully I have a No star rating for it but Yuna Ito (who played as Reira) was so beautiful and captivated me with her song taking me far away from the fact that this movie was so horrible. It was as though the heavens opened up and sent her down to earth to save the viewers of this movie. Her beauty and voice added 2 Stars to this other wise NO star flop of movie.

The bottom line is that this will be appreciated more by fans of the anime/manga series to finally get a chance to see their beloved characters in a live action movie. To a normal person just watching this as a movie.... well... it pretty much stinks like bad sushi. Oh yeah, and forgot to mention as a musician myself for this to be considered some rock type of romance movie give me a break.",1308873600,3,4723,4.190528634361233
2597405,5,B000G1IZF0,"I first saw this movie when flying to Asia in 2006 - I'm happy that it is out on DVD now here in the USA. It is a movie about an unexpected unconditional friendship between two young women with the same name (Nana), both who are trying to find their career and path in life in the big and impersonal Tokyo. Both have personal and career difficulties and find strength in each other. The acting of the two main characters is superb. Nana ""Hachi"" Komatsu is somewhat innocent, needy, and seems to have led a sheltered life. Nana Osaki is a budding hard rock star who is worldly and has seen many of the more painful sides of life. Despite the differences they are able to form a true friendship and face the world together. The acting is extremely believable and the geniuneness of the women oozes out of the screen. Mika Nakashima, who plays the rocker, exudes compassion and a seriousness. Aoi Miyazaki, ""Hachi"", is somewhat immature but is basically a good person. The movie really recruits viewers into caring about them, and for wishing the best for them. Another aspect of the movie I liked was that it never became too serious and dark. All the characters are attempting to survive and find happiness, without it coming at the expense of others. There is a consistent theme of an upbeat positivity and of an overarching friendship. The plot stays within itself and makes eminent sense. There is not an overreaching plot line which falls on itself.
  I think that all of us wish that we had a platonic friend who cared for us absolutely without expecting something return. People who are interested in any of the subjects of friendship, Japan, Japanese culture, all would like this film. Overall a beautiful movie.",1298160000,5,1718,4.666666666666667
2597406,4,B000G1IZF0,"You'll thoroughly enjoy this movie whether you've read the original manga or not (I haven't.) The story is developed with a lot of spirit and energy. Two young women, vastly different in personality, happen to meet by chance and share the same name. The naive, friendly Nana is soon given the nickname Japanese people might call an eager puppy: Hachi. The worldly, sharp-tongued,  intelligent one remains simply Nana. She's also a gifted singer, strongly ambitious and independent. Her lover is a brilliant and similarly ambitious guitarist, Ren, and both are driven to seek their own path.  The struggle between these two powerful personalities is the most interesting aspect of the movie.

Although this movie deals with rock-n'-roll personalities and concerts, there is no drug-taking, wild sex or destructive behavior in general. The romance between Nana and Ren, although intense and demanding, is also respectful in mood. There are a couple of mild sex scenes, sweet rather than graphic. I liked the gradual way we come to understand the reasons why Nana and Ren have trusted only each other, their early histories, the ways by which they recovered from deep wounds. I like the way naive Hachi, who at first seems optimistic to the point of foolishness, gains wisdom and strength. It all develops naturally and convincingly.

Last but not least, the concert scenes are excellent. See it!",1296950400,,1393,5.1233480176211454

I have only one complaint though. The subtitles. They take far too many liberties in the translation. The story is still the same, but far too many times I'll read the subtitles and hear them speak and say, ""That is not what so-and-so just said!"" If you can, I recommend watching without.

2597413,3,B000G1IZF0,"To read the synopsis, and from watching the first 5 minutes or so, you might be put off this film by how trivial it appears. And, well, it IS a trivial movie. Not much happens and you know how things will end in the end but that's part of its charm. It doesn't take itself too seriously and at its heart is a very sweet tale of friendship between two quite different young women. Basically, the 3 star rating is for people who, like me, are interested in Japan and the Japanese music scene. In the same way that a lover of Japan would have had a greater appreciation for Lost in Translation than the average cinema goer. Personally, I'm ordering the sequel, aptly titled Nana 2, but if Japanese culture (particularly J-rock) doesn't do it for you, you'd be best looking elsewhere.",1214956800,3,780,4.461538461538462
2597414,5,B000G1IZF0,"First let me just say, Mika Nakashima, who plays rocker Nana is HOT!

I've been a fan of movies from Japan since I saw Ghost in the Shell a few years ago.  I've seen and enjoyed Azumi the female Ninja, Last Quarter, a ghost story, and the Pulp Fiction inspired Shark Skin Man.  So I was about 10 minutes into Nana when I realized that I was watching a ""chick flick"" or Shojo as its called in japanese.

As you may know Nana is about two girls who have nothing in common, except they both have the same first name. And they have one other very important thing in common. They both find out how difficult love can be.

The two Nanas are both played by great actresses. Aoi Miyazaki is the spoiled Nana who has nice clothes and shoes and hair and seems to get jobs because of her looks.  And rocker Nana is Mika Nakashima, a singer in real life, who as I mentioned before, is HOT!

Rather than outline the story, which has already been done in other reviews, I'll just say I liked Nana enough that I am now waiting for Nana 2 to be released in the US.

I always hate it when the original actors don't return for the sequel and Nana is no exception.

The guy who plays rocker Nana's ex-boyfriend, Ren won't be in the sequel, which is fine since he can't act.  Nor is Aoi, the Nana with the huge smile. Normally missing 2 original actors would really turn me off, but actress Mika, rocker Nana, is going to return. She does such an excellent job of portraying her character that I could not imagine anyone else in the part.

Although the ending of Nana has a satisfactory wrap up there are also some unanswered questions which leave room for the sequel.

  The end to rock Nana's story was not what I wanted for her, but I am glad to say that rocker Nana herself questions her own actions as well.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nana/dp/B0012EM5II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nana</a>",1214784000,,1916,4.548104956268221

I became a fan of Aoi Miyazaki she is such a talented actress- I think one of the reasons why this film rocks is because of Aoi and her smile which tugs the core of the heart. The chemistry between Mika and Aoi is incredible that while watching the movie you can feel their sorrow and difficulties.. The scenes between these two characters  are very well done without going over the top or dramatic.. The Nana 2 is a let down because Aoi is not in the cast anymore..her presence was truly missed..

Then there is the singer Nana played by Mika Nakashima (a singer in real life) who is a fiercely independent member of a rock band trying to work her way up to fame.  They end up living together and learn and grow from each other.  Some people may find it frustrating that Miyazaki's character can be so timid and weak or how her romantic relationship is dealt with.  However, I think it is essential when watching this movie to know that this is in a different culture and so the gender roles are slightly different.  Keeping that in mind, this is a great story about two drastically different girls' close friendship.",1207785600,14,920,4.467065868263473
2597418,4,B000G1IZF0,"NANA (2005) is a live-action Japanese movie based on a popular manga series which has also been turned into an animated series. It's about two girls named Nana, both aged 20, who wind up as roommates in Tokyo, after having moved there from small towns many hours away. As romantic and career tribulations swirl around them, their friendship grows deeper as they come to rely on each other for sustenance. One, nicknamed ""Hachi"" (puppy dog) by the other, is all bright eyes, big smiles and good cheer, full of romantic dreams. The other Nana is a dark, moody girl rocker with a sardonic approach to life who hides her pain under a ""cool"" faade.

It's a sweet, gentle, touching drama with quite a different tone from the more frenetic manga and somewhat less frenetic anime series. The movie takes selected scenes from the first five volumes of the manga, leaves out quite a bit, and tells the story in a very different order. Still, there's no reason fans can't enjoy all three--manga, anime and movie, particularly since the lead actresses playing the two Nanas in the movie are so perfectly cast, capturing the quirks, charms, and essential appeal (and annoying tics, as well) of the manga characters. Former model Aoi Miyazaki plays Hachi--all big eyes, blinding smiles and a parade of very cute fashions--while J-rock star Mika Nakashima plays the rocker Nana with more of a punk style--glaring eyes, dark makeup, jagged jewelry, multiple piercings, leather jacket and an ever-present cigarette between her fingers. The actresses show great chemistry with each other, far more than they do with the actors playing their boyfriends. I should point out that Hachi comes off a lot more innocent in the movie than she does in the manga and anime, chiefly because her bedroom scenes with two different lovers are left out.

For a movie with a rock music background and a rock star lead, there aren't many songs. Rocker Nana sings one at the beginning and one in the middle, both of them enjoyable, if undistinguished J-rock tunes. Yuna Ito, playing Reira, lead singer of rival rock group Trapnest (whose lead guitarist is Nana's ex-boyfriend), sings two songs in a more J-pop vein.

NANA was followed in late 2006 by NANA 2, a sequel which upset many fans by recasting the role of Hachi with yet another former model, Yui Ichikawa. As someone who saw the second film first and enjoyed it at the time, I have to confess I understand the fans' dissatisfaction after seeing the first NANA and then again after watching both films back-to-back for this review and one of NANA 2. Still, if you like the characters here enough to want to see their further adventures, NANA 2 is worth a look as well.",1201478400,4,2691,4.7827956989247316

8128375,5,B000G1IZF0,I really enjoyed this movie version. All though I would really have liked Anna Tsuchiya as Nana and Olivia Lufkin as Reira. Still the movie was a good version.,1379635200,,159,4.517241379310345
8128376,5,B000G1IZF0,"I never read the magna this movie is based on. Just took a chance on the video and I fell in love with the story. It was an enchanting look at the loss of innocence and the ties of friendship. Very well-done movie with great characters, great settings. It was very entertaining to watch the development of these two young girls, their romances and their triumphs and failings. I would recommend it highly.",1366502400,,405,4.561643835616438
