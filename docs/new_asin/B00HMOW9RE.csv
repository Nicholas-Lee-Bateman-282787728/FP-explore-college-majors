6184530,4,B00HMOW9RE,"I'm mystified on some of the choices Warner Brothers made here. There are still a number of great sports themed episodes which have never been released on dvd. Why the continued double dipping?
Why not ""Twenty Thousand Screams Under the Sea"" instead of once again giving us ""Rocky Mountain Yiii!""?
Or ""The Spooky Case of the Grand Prix Race"" instead of ""The Beast Is Awake In Bottomless Lake""?
Still there are a number of great new to dvd episodes here in addition to the new episode.
It will have to do until we get complete season sets of The Scooby Doo Show (season 2), The Scooby and Scrappy Doo Show (season 1), The New Scooby and Scrappy Doo Show (1983), and The New Scooby Doo Mysteries (1984).",1394409600,15,701,4.52755905511811

6184541,4,B00HMOW9RE,"All in all, the episodes picked for this set were pretty good, given the 13-episode max constraint. The first episode is definitely the best. It features Scooby and the gang at the Brazilian World Cup, where the Eshu tries to steal a special soccer ball. Some people noted that the animation for the specials has been declining, but the animation for Ghastly Goals is good enough to not be distracting. It's a fast-paced adventure that almost makes the set worth it in itself.

The next episode, from Mystery Incorporated, seemed a little out of place since that series is not part of the same continuity. Granted, it continued with another soccer mystery. But the Planispheric Disk saga, a darker tone, the unsolved Nibiru mystery, and changes to the gang's personalities may leave some casual viewers confused or frustrated.

The classic episodes were for the most part a treat to see again. Demon in the Dugout is a new-to-DVD Scrappy episode, and it was fun to watch the gang travel to Japan and investigate the baseball stadium. The 3 Scooby-Doo Show episodes were also good, especially with the high-stakes tennis match in Warlock of Wimbledon. The Beast is Awake was arguably a water sport episode, but the theme didn't seem to run as strong here. Warner Bros should have released The Spooky Case of the Grand Prix Race or something else that hasn't been on DVD before. Also, they recycled Rocky Mountain Yiiiii from another Spooky Tales Set since it includes skiing; they had other Scrappy episodes, such as Pigskin Scooby, that would have provided more new episodes.

The second disk had more new content. Two of the episodes include a short with Yabba-Doo, who makes his DVD debut in this set. The 7-minute capers are excellent for younger viewers. Also, there was a new episode episode with 2 11-minute capers, featuring Scooby, Shaggy, Scrappy, and Daphne investigating mini mysteries. With these 3 new episodes, you get 8 stories, including 3 sport ones, that provide variety. It also includes an old one with water skiing and 2 racing episodes from What's New, Scooby-Doo? WNSD was probably the best way to end the set: fun and lightheartedly, with the gang participating in the competition.

In total you get 5 new episodes and 10 new stories, combined with strong older episodes. This set came just in time for the World Cup.",1403308800,2,2341,4.874371859296482
