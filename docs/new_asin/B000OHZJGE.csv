2795625,5,B000OHZJGE,"On the commentary that comes with this DVD, film historian Christopher Frayling has many interesting insights, but he finds fault with the number of subplots in Colossus of Rhodes.  I find this puzzling, because isn't one frequent complaint about the peplum genre that the stories are overly simple and too many are just alike?
Part of the success of The Colossus of Rhodes is because of its thorough detail, I think.  It might take more than one viewing to understand the intricacies but isn't that one reason we buy DVDs?  This is not at all a typical 'lots of action--no sense' entry into the genre, much as I enjoy those.
Here are some of the selling points of Colossus of Rhodes:
1.  Two tyrants for the price of one!  (One is an enjoyable oaf, the other is quite cruel but has a clever wit.)
2.  Two excellent leading men!  Rory Calhoun does well enough;Georges Marchal is great as the leader of the underground.
3.  Two contrasting leading ladies, both comfortable in costume and not unpleasant on the eyes.
4.  An absolutely great music score, at times showing the influence of Ravel, especially in dance sequences.  The 'Colossus' music has a wonderfully ominous metallic sound, totally in keeping with the nefarious designs of the villains who enjoy displaying  the statue's cutting edge technology.

The plot of Colossus of Rhodes works as well as it does because it includes typical elements, for instance, the revolt of the oppressed against tyranny, and clever additions such as the machinations of the wicked against the wicked. AND, the Colossus itself is spectacular!  Scenes of the fighting taking place on its shoulder are indeed similar to Hitchcock's suspense sequences from North By Northwest.

Mr. Frayling thinks Colossus is more a pretty good warm-up for 'better' works that the director Sergio Leone would do later. Actually, a much better approach is to compare Colossus with other Peplum films and then realize how much more intelligent and less cheesy it is than others of the genre.  Leone did a great job with it.  It's 2 hrs. and 8 minutes long and there's not a dull moment anywhere.",1209513600,7,2116,4.852367688022284
2795626,4,B000OHZJGE,"Having only see Sergio Leone's The Colossus of Rhodes in a panned-and-scanned TV version before, it's surprising how much more enjoyable the film is when you see it in its proper `TotalScope' ratio. Where Leone's previous peplum, 1959's dreary and underfunded version of The Last Days of Pompeii, looked like it could have been made by any one of a hundred unimaginatively anonymous Italian directors, Colossus always looks terrific, with a mastery of the widescreen that Leone would take even further in his Westerns: this being a particularly well-funded epic, rather than the huge close-ups and empty space of later films, it's filled with people as if the producers are afraid to leave any corner of the frame without something to look at, but it wears it well. You also get to see the redressed Roman barracks set where Chuck met Stephen Boyd in Ben-Hur again, here redressed as a royal mausoleum!

It's a genuinely spectacular affair offering pretty much everything you could want from a peplum - not much in the way of musclemen but plenty of corrupt rulers, rebels and conspiracies, torture in the dungeons and the arena, the spectacular destruction of a city in a natural disaster and imported American star Rory Calhoun imitating Victor Mature every time he laughs in profile, which is surprisingly often considering the misfortunes that befall him. Along the way Leone throws in plenty of playful riffs on Hitchcock, with the Colossus itself providing plenty of visual homages to both The Saboteur and North by Northwest. Not a major work by any means but a surprisingly enjoyable one.

While this is the American release version rather than the slightly longer Italian version, it's still a good DVD, with a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, informative audio commentary by Leone biographer Christopher Frayling and the US theatrical trailer.",1197763200,,1853,5.092105263157895
2795627,5,B000OHZJGE,"This is one transfer to DVD that has been worth the effort. . . and worth the wait. Fortunately, there is still an audience for these Spanish-Italian spectaculars. After the many disappointing transfers of the sword-and-sandal genre -- such as ROME AGAINST ROME, THE TROJAN HORSE, the washed-out color of THE AVENGERS (THE LAST GLORY OF TROY) and the interesting but dismal print of FURY OF ACHILLES -- this is a welcome appearance on a big-screen TV. If only the experts who tackled this transfer would tackle some of the other Italian epics, those of us who teach mythology, or just appreciate it for its own sake, would be happier.
  We have no GOOD, BAD, AND UGLY score for this pre-spaghetti western effort by Sergio Leone, and we have none of the stylistic flourishes that became a Leone staple in his garlic-flavored shoot-'em-ups, but we do have another missplaced American actor in the grinning persona of Rory Calhoun, who is a long way from his RIVER OF NO RETURN. He seems to know he is out-of-place with his miniskirt and grinning ""I'm so handsome so it doesn't matter"" countenance; he doesn't even bother to change his hairstyle from the Fonz-fifties greaser look. Why Leone didn't bother to do anything about his appearance as a Greek hero is a curiosity; perhaps his name in the credits was all he was after at the time. This was, after all, not EL CID or THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, and Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef were undoubtedly not available to wear the toga fashion of 280BC. Some reviewers are looking for hints of the stylized Leone touch, as I was. Perhaps one can count the knife-throwing youth who might be a prototype for the deadly accurate Eastwood with a gun, able to gun down five men from a fence. After all, doesn't Eastwood's zarape resemble a toga? And you thought we were in the southwest with those two follow-ups to A FISTFALL OF DOLLARS.
  Anyway, it is fortunate that this transfer was made with the anamorphic vistas clearly visible in sharp, crisp colors -- something that was not always apparent in these Italian epics, some of which appeared as though the prints had been processed at the local drugstore. Exceptions would be the two Hercules film starring British strongman Reg Park. HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN (film in 70mm but relying, in one scene, upon music from 1950s USA sci-fi films) are available in crystal clear color versions on DVD. As clear as the images are in THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES, this DVD belongs on the collector's shelf with those two films.
  The colossus itself invites comparisons with the metal creature of Talus in Harryhausen's superb effects epic JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, although this colossus doesn't come to life and start chasing the mortals around the island. The images of the Greek sea (filmed in Spain) remind one of the beautiful images of THE MAGUS.
  The second male lead in this film is the (bleach)blond-headed Georges Marchal, a veteran of such efforts as SIGN OF THE GLADIATOR. He bears a startling resemblance to American actor Tom Drake (MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and WARLOCK); only John Drew Barrymore is conspicuous by his absence.
  So. . . no scenery chewing by Barrymore. . . and no muscule flexing by Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott, Mark Forrest and the rest. . . but plenty of the usual intrigue until the deus ex machina of the earthquake (standing in for the volcanic eruption at the finale of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII and HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN) topples the colossus. If the film makes you run for your classical history texts, great. If you merely enjoy the brilliant colors and action on the widescreen, fine. This is well worth the price of a ticket to the ancient world.",1197331200,,3720,4.7092307692307696
2795628,4,B000OHZJGE,"Excellent product for action history buffs, or those who just like a good story.  This deals with one of the ancient seven wonders of the world.  It was destroyed in an earthquake, in fact.  Interesting engineering problem!  Political mistake!  Usurpation of the ruler (attempted)!  The island is still there, today, but not the Colossus!  It has nothing to do with the scholar!  Good acting, but some hokey effects, mostly true, though!  Well worth taking a cruise today in the Med, also.  You have to enjoy classic movies, though--it's in color, if that helps.  Phoenicians are bad guys.",1194566400,3,589,4.969072164948454
2795629,3,B000OHZJGE,"COLOSSUS OF RHODES provides a good look at Sergio Leone's roots--and the roots of the Italian Western--in the peplum (or ""sword and sandal"") genre that dominated popular Italian film in the late 50s and early 60s, just before the western boom. There is little in this film to suggest the master stylist that Leone would become just a few years later. But it's one of the better peplum films, with high production values that look especially good on this transfer. And there is one delightful shot that seems to prefigure, in a comic way, Leone's later attraction to extreme closeups of eyeballs.",1185840000,12,595,4.8431372549019605

2795659,4,B000OHZJGE,"The name sounds familiar but I can't quite place the face.  Maybe it's the skirt (I don't care what you call it, it's still a skirt).  Rory Calhoun.  Wasn't he primarily an actor in westerns?  Whose bright idea was it to star him in a sword and sandal flick?

I think it's pretty safe to classify this as a spectacle (I mean that in the nicest way possible).  There is a lot of pomp and ceremony on display, literally a cast of thousands.  And at one point, it turns into a disaster flick.  The over-produced plot involves several attempts to overthrow the tyrannical king of Rhodes (by rebel Rhodians and sneaky Phoenicians).  There are backstabbers galore, spies, assassins, lions, and liars.  Rory plays a tourist from Greece who soon finds himself barred from leaving this hotbed of intrigue, the island of Rhodes.  Rory spends an alarming amount of time in this movie grinning like a letch, chasing anything in skirts (literally).  Death and destruction follows in his wake.  (John Derek was supposed to play Rory's role but he didn't get along with Sergio Leone so they replaced him with a cowboy star.  Makes perfect sense.)  The scenery is fabulous, the sets are cheap and gaudy, the costumes are skirts by any name, the dialog is simply scintillating, the acting is uniformly inadequate.  But it is fun and unintentionally funny.  They don't make movies like this anymore (at least not on purpose).",1397260800,,1407,4.771784232365145

2795673,4,B000OHZJGE,"First up, a confession.
I take a rather guilty pleasure in watching those quasi-biblical/historical/egyptian/vaguely mespotamian epics where they spend all the money on the scenery and costumes and then utilise the woodenest of actors, and all those tiny models for the effects. NO CGI, just inventive human make-do!

That being said, this film pleases on all those levels.
Perhaps not as ""camp"" as ""The Prodigal"" (see my review for the salacious details), but this is an epic romp nonetheless.
If you've read my review of the aforementioned movie, then you know that the wardrobe for that production featured literally thousands of tassels. Here it's serious fringes that adorn the edges of just about everything.

If you are a lover of fine masculine legs, then you are in for a real smorgasbord here!
With the minor exception of the old King, ALL the other men's Greek(?)costumes are short, ...VERY short; ...and the men are certainly men too, ..hairy chests and all!
 NONE of those over-waxed and scrapped steroided pretty-boy clones you see passed off as masculine specimens now.

Rory Calhoun wears a never-ending series of smart little cocktail numbers, ...one in particular exposing quite an amount of his naked hips and butt-cheeks.
He always seems to have a new ""frock"" for every occasion, ....even having escaped to a rebel camp in rags he then immediately appears in a perfectly clean and neatly pressed little outfit trimmed with Greek embroidery of sorts. Where did he get it from? Everybody else is in rags, and I didn't see him bring any equivalent of an ancient Greek suitcase, ...but of course this is the movies folks!

Mention must also be made of his natty selection of THE campest ""ancient"" boots that accompany each ensemble too!
Oh, and I did like the way that each outfit for all the men came with its own neat little colour co-ordinated pair of Speedos to preserve modesty in those wrestling/stunt scenes too!

Calhoun's hair, ...chock full of that-greasy-kid-stuff, is slicked back in a strictly modern for the time style with absolutely no concessions to period at all, and he goes through the entire movie like a big kid in some sort of Disneyland ancient world themed ride.

He's given TWO leading ladies, ....one a nice little rebel girl who pines for him while he's in the vile clutches of the other.
Mind you ,shy she might be in love, but she rides a horse like a damn valkyrie at a breakneck gallop! (Yes, it's her stunt-double of course but just watch her go!)

His other scheming inamorata is played by some little piece (Lea Massari)surely picked up from the local lumber yard. I assure you that you will never see such sheer acting inadequacies exposed so fully as when this little wannabee only just avoids the termites!
She's supposed to be the double-crossing, manipulative man-eating temptress, but her charms are about as sexy as last week's left-over lasagna.
Still, she gets to wear some nice female drag, and dies right on cue, if totally unconvincingly.....

Of course our hero is then left free to return to that little rebel ripping-rider for the credits! (Sigh!)

The story gets a bit convoluted somewhere towards the end, with people swapping sides and suddenly doing unexpected things out of character with what has gone on previously, but don't worry if you feel you're losing the plot. I assure you that you are NOT the only one! Director Sergio Leone seems to have only had a very tentative grip on it right from the start!

There are more than a few gaping holes in that somewhat sketchy ""plot"" too, but it DOES have all the expected standards for this genre.

Let's tick 'em off!
Yes, there's the obligatory dance sequence with writhing servant girls/temple attendants in veils and such; ....yes there's the banquet scene with dancing/juggling entertainment; ...yes there's the sacrifice to the gods in the huge OTT pagan temple complete with huge fierce looking statues, fire, flames and smoke; ....yes there's the torture scene, this one involving dripping acid(?) and an very serious attempt to induce major tinnitus! You won't believe how this is done!(I cracked up at this point! Quasimodo anyone?) ....the victim emerges bleeding profusely from the ears, but seems to carry on with the rest of the movie without any loss of hearing so it's all good. Still, an interesting departure from the usually employed torture methods.

Yes there's the assassination of the king; ...yes there's the Colosseum-type arena where the rebels are pitted against outrageous odds and animals. Here it's jumping over the blades attached to the axles of a fast chariot, while chained in close proximity to burning brambles, or being suspended over a lion pit as knives are thrown cutting your bonds to allow you to fall. (As I said, A+ here for inventive executions and tortures..)
Yes, there's the earthquake with shaking camera and lots of those tiny wooden block buildings falling down on people; ....and there are the usual compliment of disposable secondary characters, recognisable instantly, that are simply provided to die on cue, usually saving the hero.

The Colossus, ...of which only the feet and calves are ""actual"", ...the rest is of course a small model, but the inside looks OK, designed by a da Vinci lookalike, (who dies of course!), and it contains a huge collection of ingenious levers and mechanics that operate all sorts of devices, ...some a great way from the statue itself.
There's mention of the sighting of the approach of a vast Phoenician invading fleet, but what happens to it we never see, or hear, because right on cue, a violent storm and earthquake occur, interrupting the whole narrative, providing the film's ending, and totally ignoring any settling of the issues of the prior plot line.
The baddies all die, most of the goodies survive, ...except the cute little bloke with his hairy chest. Shame!
And of course the earthquake spells the end for the big bronze Oscar, and all the double-crossing conspirators too .
Talk about a deus-ex-machina!

Again, you can tell I loved this. Maybe not quite as much as seeing Lana Turner sashay about in ""The Prodigal"", ...or Joan Collins chew the scenery in ""Land of the Pharaohs"" while wearing purple makeup, but The Colossus is a fun, fairly fast paced romp through highly spurious ""ancient times"" for those who like their history hysterical.
Never a dull moment, that's for sure!",1362009600,2,6402,4.936802973977695

2795676,3,B000OHZJGE,"For the longest time, I never thought I would actually see this film.  This is Sergio Leone's first official film as director, and it's been notoriously hard to find in any home video format.  I was plesantly surprised when I found out that it was officially released, so I rented it immediately.

Leone started as an assistant director on many Hollywood productions that shot in Italy in the 1950's, and many of them were part of the Roman epic cycle.  This film follows in that vain (even though it's on Rhodes, not Rome), and it's a decent ""Roman"" epic film, nothing more.  You would have to be clairvoyant to think that Leone would go on to direct masterpieces after this film, though.  Some of the action scenes are awkwardly choreographed, and much of the acting is rather formless (the film has that awkward dubbing best known in Italian films), or it's so over the top.  Many have said Rory Calhoun was miscast here, but I thought he was OK.  He wasn't great, but it didn't bother me that much.  He's kind of endearingly goofy, like he knows he really shouldn't be in the film, but he's enjoying himself anyway.  The original leading man, John Derek, was fired early in the production because Leone was convinced that he was trying to steal his job (John Derek did go on to be a director, but his films were horrible).  It's kind of fun to see Lea Masari in this film.  The previous year she played Anna, the woman who disappears in L'avventura.  Maybe this is where Anna ended up.

There is some good here.  Leone's framing is pretty good, the crowd scenes are well handled, the plot twists are surprisingly good for a film like this, the inside of the Collusus is cool, and the film is never boring.  It's definitely worth watching once, just don't expect the beauty and mastery of Leone's best films.  It's not a great debut or anything, but if you're a Leone fan (like me), you should check it out nevertheless.",1247702400,10,1923,4.5436046511627906

8185031,3,B000OHZJGE,"""Colossus"" is, in my mind, a grade B film. Rory Calhoun is great in westerns but not in this film, but it is most likely not his fault. The film is overlong, about an hour too long, there are many unnecessary scenes, Rory smiles a lot which is appropriate for grade B films but not an action adventure, and the ending is a deus ex machina (a literary device where an implausible concept or character is brought into the story to resolve the conflict in the story and create a pleasing solution.)
The 1959 film describes what it imagines occurred in the island of Rhodes in 230 BCE. According to the film, the second in command after the king of Rhodes, Thor, has devised a plan to kill the king and take over the nation of Rhodes and later the entire world with the help of Phoenicians. The people see Thor bring to Rhodes a huge number of slaves. Unbeknownst to them, the large group are not slaves but Phoenician soldiers who came to help him overtake the government. Thor also arranged that a large fleet of Phoenician boats will bring more Phoenician soldiers. How can he be stopped? This is where the deus ex machina comes into play.
Rory Calhoun plays a Greek who is visiting Rhodes who becomes entangled in the plot and sides with Thors enemies. While there seems to be a mild attraction between him and a woman, but nothing more, at the end of the film, true to Grade B films, with nothing really leading up to it, Rory says he is going to marry the woman and she smiles acceptance.",1525219200,,1490,4.4021739130434785
