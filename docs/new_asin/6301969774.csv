390712,5,6301969774,Where is the rest of the mini series?! This VHS has been cut to shreds! Of course it has my darling Natalie Wood in the lead in her Golden Globe winning performance and as usual she is stunning in a role originated by Deborah Kerr...it's worth the viewing just to watch Miss Wood in a performance that simply drips with sensuality and longing!,1049414400,3,343,4.4603174603174605

390714,3,6301969774,"The version I purchased was cut considerably. Originally a six hour mini-series, my version was condensed to 110 minutes. While enjoyable if you've read the novel by James Jones, there were several key scenes missing. The acting is very good, but the missing scenes make it difficult to recommend.",1011398400,6,297,5.081632653061225
390715,4,6301969774,"Although this is a made for television remake of the original, it is pretty good even though William Devane is no Burt Lancaster and Natalie Wood was not at her best. The role of Private Pruitt, here portrayed by Steve Railsback, was the best part of the film - I liked him much better than Sinatra in the part - he was more believable. The rest of the supporting cast did a competant job and I found it compelling viewing.",1003881600,3,423,4.3
390716,5,6301969774,"Frank Sinatra is at his movie career best in both of his top performances of his movie career!  Frank is Maggio in From Here to Eternity. Noone else  could have played that character but Frank. Maggio the street-wise poor  Italian who wears his heart on his sleeve and dies a hero in this movie.  Frank knew that this role was his and he becomes Maggio. An unforgettable  great performance which gave him an Oscar for his performance.
Also,  Frank is ""Pal Joey"" in the great Rodgers/Hart musical ""Pal  Joey"". Frank's voice and personna were at his greatest in Pal Joey.  Frank is the guy who just can't resist the ""dames."" Frank's  phraseology is pure Frank. ""Lady is a Tramp"" was never performed  better by Sinatra. His glib nature and sentimental swagger make this movie  nothing but pure Frank. It is my personal favorite and reminds me most of  who the real Frank Sinatra was. A man in love with life and his music.  Doesn't get better than that.  I highly recommend both of these for any  serious Frank Sinatra fans.",967680000,2,1021,4.594444444444444

390770,5,6301969774,"More faithful to James Jones' book than the more-celebrated 1953 film. Great for fans of WWII dramas with fine acting all around.

Natalie Wood has never been sexier. Bill Devane is good as well. Begat a short-lived weekly NBC series with Barbara Hershey replacing Natalie.

High-priced, but worth the tab. Please note, it's ONLY available in VHS format!!!!",1360713600,,357,5.137931034482759
390771,4,6301969774,"Having caught TORA! TORA! TORA! on TV recently and being assailed on a daily basis by William Devane's TV commercials urging one to buy gold, I revisited this version of the James Jones classic novel about Pearl Harbor.

This is a really good TV movie, done in 1979.  Producer/Director Buzz Kulik (who directed two of the more outstanding episodes of ""Twilight Zone"") helms this miniseries beautifully.  The acting is top-shelf, all the way.  Genuine sparks fly between Natalie Wood (in one of her last roles) and latter-day ""Goldfinger"" William Devane.  Steve Railsback is absolutely ideal as the underdog hero, Robert E. Lee Prewitt. (Prewitt and Prove It - so similar in sound - a subliminal intent on Jones' part when he came to name his character?) Versatile Railsback earlier played Manson and later played Ed Gein - and is a relatively underrated, unacknowledged talent, sadly so.  Joe Pantoliano is the perfect Maggio - and if Sinatra won the Oscar for his turn in this role, Pantoliano should have won an Emmy for his go at it.  The great cast also includes Peter Boyle, Will Sampson, Andy Griffith, Roy Thinnes and Kim Basinger admirably filling the shoes of Donna Reed's character, the golden-hearted whore Lorene a.k.a Alma - and ""that's a nice name too"" as Prewitt tells her.

This version, yes, had more time to develop its characters and storyline.  It also had greater freedom from censorship, therefore could be truer to the book and the times. And as great as the Zinnemann version from the fifties was, this one is better.  And as much as I think the world of Monty Clift, his Prewitt was way too patrician to ever be ultimately believable as a boxer from coal mining Kentucky.  Railsback is the real thing!

There are faults, sure.  The music is too much - both in its love themes and its underscoring of times of high danger and tension.  The stock shots from the aforementioned TORA! TORA! TORA! are jarring when they are cut into the rest of the film.  They reminded me of the sixties show THE TIME TUNNEL - and how stock shots of Custer's Last Stand or the Alamo or the Siege of Troy were interpolated into the actions of our heroes Doug and Tony.  When this happened, it only better defined how low budget the Irwin Allen series - fun as it is - actually was!  So to here, in the Pearl Harbor attack scenes.  And the wrap-up scenes after the attack are rather soapy.  There is no real sense of any impact the attack had on the people whose lives we have been following for five hours.

Speaking of time: there are, apparently, three VHS versions floating around.  All look to have the same cover.  So be forewarned:  check the time on the version you may purchase.  One butchered version clocks in at 110 minutes. Avoid it at all costs, literally and culturally.  One is the full version at 278 minutes - and apparently available in a three cassette format.  The last - and the one I luckily have had since it release in 1992 - is a single cassette on the 278 minutes version.  (It says 278 minutes on the actual tape - yet on the back of the box is a professionally produced sticked that reads: Running Time 295 minutes.  I'm not sure what that discrepancy indicates.)

Pearl Harbor, yes, was a Day of Infamy. In the world of film, the fact that this miniseries is NOT yet on DVD are continuing days of infamy. So much total crap is churned out on disc - yet this wonderful effort is only available as of this writing on video!  The video, by-the-way, is far from a great or even a good image.  It is just OK.  But it is all we have.

For the sake of Natalie Wood lovers alone - put this on DVD!

So, what's in your safe?  In mine is this neglected but wonderful take on an American classic of literature and an event in American history that must never be forgotten.  Even though someone, somewhere has forgotten to transfer this gem to disc.",1360627200,4,3869,4.524495677233429
390772,5,6301969774,"Unfortunately this doesnt come in DVD and VHS of course isn't HD, but in spite of that this mini-series has Natalie Wood and William Devane at their best.

390773,5,6301969774,"I have been looking for this movie for many years and I found it here at Amazon.com in it full 4.5 hour format without it be cut down. (The movie From Here to Eternity [VHS] with Natalie Wood)
I was very pleased to find it after the years that I have search for it for so long. And it was in new condition. I would like to see it or get in DVD format but at least I have it on VHS. It's a great movie and staring Natalie Wood, which is one of my favorite actresses.
I rate the move a 5 stars and it a great find if you can find it. Thanks Amazon.",1258243200,5,546,3.7155172413793105
390774,5,6301969774,"""He was the best soldier.  Hell, he was the only soldier.""

Okay, I'm not going to go so far as to say this version of the James Jones novel is better than the 1954 ""classic"" movie, although in some respects I do think it is superior, in others not, I believe its merits make it the equal of the celebrated film.

The greatest strength this miniseries has for lovers of the novel is having the time to tell the full story, fleshing out several of the subplots, most especially Maggio's ordeal in the stockade, while also having time to more deeply examine the relationships between Warden and Karen Holmes and Prewitt and Loreen.  So much of the story was necessarily truncated in the film that much of what was loved in the novel was missing.

Next of course, the miniseries could be more honest about the sexuality of the relationships, and more graphic about the brutality visited upon Prew in ""the treatment"" and, again, Judsen's persecution and torture of Maggio.

Finally, casting.  And here the heresy.  I find this cast in some ways superior to the film.  Although she displayed a harder edge, it was a bit of a stretch buying Donna Reed as a prostitute.  The very young Kim Bassinger, though inexperienced as an actress, brings the right beauty and youth to the role and the depiction does not have to be sanitized as it was in the 1950's film.  I know Sinatra won the Oscar for his Maggio, and he was fine.  But I think a very young Joe Pantalione did just as well, and had the benefit of more screen time, especially in his brutal descent into madness.  I am fond of Deborah Kerr in many of her roles, but quite frankly for my money she can't hold a candle to Natalie Wood's Karen Holmes for pure sexual heat coupled with vulnerability.  I think Monty Clift was one of our greatest actors, but I don't think he came as close to embodying the Kentucky hillbilly of Steve Railsback's Prewitt.  Clift is always a tremendous screen presence, and Railsback might have not fared as well on the big screen, but I never believed Clift was a Kentucky coalminer's son, but I did believe Railsback.  Finally, Burt Lancaster again had the big screen presence and was an athletic Warden, but I am very fond of William Devane's cynical and knowing Top Sgt. and we get more of him and some of his better dialogue with the extended format. Oh, and Peter Boyle makes a nasty Fatso Judsen to equal Ernie Borgnine's.

So, I believe the expanded story is better, deepening the characters and giving us more of the stories that made the novel beloved by many.  It is at least on a par as far as cast.  It obviously does not have the precision of the film and Fred Zinneman's excellent direction, but Buzz Kulik handles the bigger story well.  It suffers from the lower production standards of TV films, but manages to get a credible Pearl Harbor attack by incorporating some Tora Tora Tora footage.

All in all, the update allows Jones's sexy, funny, complex and tragic story a full-telling without the prudery and reticence of the 50's, and without emulating the earlier film but rather re-imagining the novel on film with an excellent cast.  And no, they don't duplicate the celebrated dopey beach scene, but instead depict the novel's more explicit interlude.

All in all, well worthwhile, and I wish it was on DVD because it is going to be hard to find this one.",1155340800,13,3356,4.575250836120401

Though it STILL does not add a couple of subplots that would have been nice...Malloy for one...Bloom for another, etc. both lost to brevity concerns, it is still a better version.  Yet, I think the 'Re-enlistment Blues' should have been left in and Prew and Friday given credit  for writing it as in the book too.
