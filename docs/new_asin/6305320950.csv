I probably will go see it again at the  theater, though. I cried at the begining and at the end, I laughed, I was  angry. Alot of emotions for this film! Great music, and great African song  !!!!!!

1008421,3,6305320950,"It's so hard to see how much 18 years of improvements in film making can make this film be a jarringly inept mess.  A kids' movie even back then, I can't see any modern kid older than eight ""buying into this production.""  No need to list the errors.  I had to fast forward many times and didn't even really watch the ending, because it was so sappy.  Today's typical Disney work is as fraught, no doubt, with today's ""acceptable qualities,"" that a decade's growth will similarly reduce to a ""klunky effort from the past.""  Also kinda miffed that the film was such a leering slavering peeping-at-Charlize-Theron-in-fully-blossomed-allure vehicle.  It was way too much in the ogling department.  Paxton was not up to selling the material; phoned it in.  Gave it three stars because it has some viewing value to young kids whose parents watch with them to explain the violence.

The black and white version of Mighty Joe Young wowed me back-when; might have to watch it again to see if I'm remembering correctly my inner-ten-year-old's experiences.

In 1998, this was a 4.5 star film.  But all the audiences globally have evolved -- this is history, on the hoof, clomping inside each nervous system -- ain't no looking homeward angels to be found.  Maybe in another 20 years, this work might become ""cute"" because of its ""adorable"" film errors.  If I'm around, it might just be funzies to review this dynamic.  I'll be 92 years old though.  Don't count my having this as a concern.  Heh.",1466467200,,1484,4.76078431372549

This time I purchased the digital version from Amazon. I have watched it twice since buying from Amazon. I insisted that my teenage granddaughters watch it with me this time. They reluctantly engaged, but soon they were engrossed too. They had to admit it was a good movie. It has strong moral lessons in it.

The sense of freedom and life is strong in this new version.  The villains are perhaps a little narrowly drawn in the newer version but I find Joe and Jill to be very real.  Charlize did a very fine job in this early career effort.  I think the reality of Joe is well realized; great technical work.

In this film, Jill Young(Theron) has been taking care of a playful, smart and fearsome gorilla named Joe since both of them were orphaned, all due to a vengeful poacher.

But when the poacher re-emerges to settle an old score with Jill, Joe comes to rescue and helps out Jill and the researcher, who later became husband and wife.

Many of the remakes born in this age of 3D, Animorphic, Super-Duper, Mind-Blowing video/audio technology are so centered on special effects, that the quality of acting, or even a decent plot and it's subsequent development are either bad to atrocious or either missing altogether.

Mighty Joe Young, the remake does an admirable job.  Is it great, well, no, but, it is nice enough to grab a soda, microwave some popcorn, grab the remote, lean back in the recliner and watch.  Not a bad way to waste a couple of hours in the late evening.

This film exceeded  my expectations and have watched it several times since it's release in 1998. I love the way they have enhanced the interaction between Jill and Joe and the different facial expressions created by the special effects. There of course have been a lot of updates made to this one which was to be expected, but surprisingly all of the updates were great.
I saw the original version of this film when I was younger and loved it. The original was released in 1949 by RKO pictures. This version is awesome. It follows the same concept as the original, however in the original Joe is put on display much in the same way King Kong was. one other difference is the rescue of the child from the ferris wheel. In the original Joe rescues children from a burning orphanage and as he is climbing down the tree with the last baby the tree falls. This rescue scene was considered as one of the best stop motion sequences in film history. You must see the 1949 version.
If you get a chance to see both at the same time do so, I think it would be interesting to compare them both. That is what I plan to do. Okay Amazon see if you can get the 1949 version in Amazon Prime",1358553600,,1347,4.2823529411764705

1009653,4,6305320950,"Sweet, and faithful to the 1949 original Mighty Joe Young, this is one of the better remakes I have seen.

While the original movie about a girl and her giant gorilla friend remains entertaining enough to stand on its own, this remake strives to do it justice, and succeeds. The two movies complement each other almost perfectly!

A fairly faithful, straightforward update of the original plot (which itself is something of an upbeat remake of King Kong), someone definitely did their homework in re-creating Mighty Joe. The computer effects and animatronics are believable, but the facial expressions and primate mannerisms are what make him so absolutely convincing.

(spoilers):

While the ""giant-gorilla-on-the-loose-in-the-big-city"" scenes don't compare to their truly outrageous counterparts in the original MJY (real, live African lions being catapulted about the Coconut Grove!), they're entertaining enough for audiences of all ages.

The remake also felt some politically-correct need to add bad guys that weren't necessary in the original, but by introducing poachers that leave the girl and Joe orphaned, they also seem to offer an ironic apology for what alsmost certainly happened in acquiring the baby gorilla for the original movie.",1206662400,,1248,5.513089005235602

was to see a cameo scene with Ray Harryhaussen in it and Terry

Moore, who played husband and wife. Who are they? Well Miss Moore

was the original lead in the 1949 Mighty Joe Young B&W version and

Ray Harryhaussen was the assistant to Willis O'Brien in the special

effects department....and went on to do his own astounding FX in 7th Voyage of Sinbad and Earth vs The Flying Saucers and many many more.

Now as far as the new version of MJY...it seemed to stick to the

original quite well...even to the scene where Joe saves the child.

Definitely Disneyfied, but nothing surprising as far as plot. I admit

the special effects did impress me, especially when was in the

streets confronting humanity. This would probably be a great addition

for youngsters who believe in a bond between humans and monkeys.",1178496000,,872,4.597402597402597

I loved that they gave Ray a cameo and I'm sure he would have to admit they did a great job on his film. I love the original, but there are parts that are dated and while Harryhausen's FX are fantastic, this remake has brought the film into a new age.

There is so much to love about this movie but I especially love the part where Jill and Joe have their justice near the end of the movie after the terrible tragedy that they both share and witness in the beginning of the film.  Very well done!
This was a beautifully done remake!  The special effects of Joe are absolutely amazing!  I am so glad I saw it on the big screen and added it to my DVD collection!",1140220800,,821,4.158227848101266
1009740,5,6305320950,"There are many who will say that this movie is a mini-KING KONG.  Certainly, they will not be wide of the mark in saying this.  There are plenty of parallels between the films, no question.  However, being as-such, it is not a good reason to see MJY or not see MJY.

Rather, MJY is quite simply a good movie, period.  Whether you compare / contrast it with KK or not, this fact remains the same.  It's a much more family-friendly movie than KK and also has a lot more humor than its ""big brother.""

The biggest reason to watch it, however, is the wonderful Charlize Theron.  She is quite simply terrific as the beauty who tries to protect the ape (an ironic twist here) from the outside world.  Unlike so many pretty faces in Hollywood, Charlize can actually ACT!

If you're home with the family on a Friday night & you want something that will please everyone, MJY is highly recommended.  Can't see anyone NOT liking this movie - period.",1134518400,5,938,4.458823529411765
1009741,5,6305320950,"Jill Young's mother is killed by a poacher while trying to protect a baby Gorilla named Joe who is rather big for his age. Jill grows up with the giant Gorilla and takes care of him in honor of her mother. Unfortunately poachers are always on the lookout for the giant gorilla, and so Jill and Joe have to relocate to a mini-preserve in California. Unfortunately the poacher that killed Jill's mother is out for revenge since Joe bit off his finger during the original encounter, and now it seems nowhere is safe for Joe.

What a beautiful movie! Charlize Theron brings real heart to her character and it is her love for Joe as part of her family that makes this a movie to believe in. Bill Paxton does a fine job as the male lead, and they are well supported by great characters and actors (Regina King among them). Also watch out for Naveen Andrews who currently appears in the television series ""Lost"". The movie is extremely well directed by Ron Underwood, and the beautiful score by James Horner adds the movie's soul to Charlize Theron's heart.

The picture quality on the DVD is good, thanks in part to the amazing cinematography, and the film is in a nicely balanced Dolby Digital 5.1. This movie is a rare gem. So yes it is a remake to the original Mighty Joe Young, and yes we have a new King Kong movie coming up, thus making this a bit of a middle child. Still, once you've seen it, you'll see how wonderful it is. Who needs King Kong? Who needs the original Mighty Joe Young? Hell, who needs Planet Of The Apes? This movie has real heart and soul, once more I credit Charlize Theron and James Horner for that. It won me over. I hope it does you too.",1126915200,8,1662,4.358064516129033
1009742,5,6305320950,"The Disney remake of ""Mighty Joe Young"" is an excellent film, but nothing beats the charm of the original film. Having said that, I think both versions are worth owning. There is a common thread that runs through both the original and this remake, and both share a somewhat similar climatic ending. But there are enough differences to make the two films unique and quite interesting in side-by-side comparisons. Of course with Disney's version you have state-of-the art CGI. Joe looks so real, it will blow your mind! A sweet tearjerker that the whole family will enjoy. The remake MJY was filmed in Color and Widescreen.

With the original ""Mighty Joe Young"" you don't get the state-of-the-art special effects of the remake, but what you do get is a much better story which tugs at all your emotions. The climax of the film is very exciting, and so touching that it brings tears to the eyes. I won't give it away as to not spoil it. The original MJY was filmed in Black & White and Full Screen.

Great news, this film is finally being released in November 2005 along with the original ""King Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"" as a special collection. It most likely will be available as a single DVD as well. It should be a winner!",1124668800,3,1221,4.545454545454546
1009743,4,6305320950,"Surprised this picture didn't do better at the box office.  After making the dreadful Hearts and Souls (with Alfre Woodard, trying to out-do GHOST) and Speechless (the romantic comedy which killed the careers of both its stars, Geena Davis and Michael Keaton) director Ron Underwood bounced back with this inventive, lively remake of an earlier 1949 movie.

It should have made Charlize Theron, who plays Jill Young, a big, big star, but instead, Charlize had to bumble on for a few more years before winning an Oscar.

James Horner's music outdoes his heart-wrenching symphonic themes for TITANIC, BRAVEHEART, and THE ROCKETEER, with a touch of African percussion and wood and wind instruments that bring the plains of Africa into mind whenever you hear them.  Charlize has a lovely song, ""Wind Song,"" sort of a lullaby for Mighty Joe, that should have been a hit on the scale of ""MY HEART WILL GO ON.""  But somehow people just weren't interested in this picture.  Maybe the forthcoming remake of KING KONG by Peter Jackson will have better luck with audiences.  It will have more publicity, for sure, for I don't think the studio was really behind Ron Underwood to the same degree that New Line supports Jackson.

What a cast!  Beyond Charlize and Bill Paxton, the movie also features Naveem Andrews (who plays Sayid on ABC's LOST) in a rather comic role, and also everyone's favorite REGINA KING from RAY.

If you liked AU HASARD BALTHAZAR by Robert Bresson, you will also enjoy MIGHTY JOE YOUNG the remake.",1118880000,13,1510,4.86328125
1009744,5,6305320950,"Sure, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a somewhat mushy movie.  SURE, it has all the cliches you expect.  Sure, some of the special effects are a little rough. But sure, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a wonderful entertaining movie, sure to bring a little tear to the eye, and entertain even the hardest cynic.  In updating the 1949 classic, director Ron Underwood (who gave us the first TREMORS)has pleasantly remade the original to make it more accessible to these ever changing times.  From the opening scenes where little Mika Boorem (Hearts of Atlantis) and her doctor mommy Linda Purl are besieged by heartless poachers to the last thirty minutes where some really exciting climactic action scenes occur, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG delivers the poignant tale of an oversized gorilla who just wants to be loved.  The special effects crew do a fine job on giving Joe his own personality with the especially effective use of Joe's eyes, and ironically, he and Charlize Theron have a remarkable screen chemistry, actually better than her chemistry with co-star Bill Paxton.  But then the movie isn't really about Paxton and Theron; it's about Joe and Charlize.  The dynamic Regina King (from RAY) does a nice turn as the doctor who also bonds with Joe; and even self-centered David Paymer as the conservancy head finally warms up to Joe.  Of course, a movie like this would be nothing without villains, and we have two good ones here:  Croatian actor Rade Sherbedgia wants revenge on Joe because after shooting Theron's mother, he loses a finger and thumb to the then infant Joe; Peter Firth (Equus) is the more compassionate (?) sidekick who claims that Rade is ""not a hunter, but a murderer.""  The climax in the heart of LA, on the freeways and finally at Palisades park delivers nicely.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot when we bought this movie, but it was a pleasant surprise and I recommend it for family viewing.",1112832000,,1886,4.790123456790123

There is some violence in this movie, and smaller children may be frightened by ""Joe"" at first, but if they can control themselves through the first few minutes, they'll fall in love with him.  There is very little, if any, foul language.
The story is simple:  Girl and giant ape are moved to the city, girl and giant ape want out, man in love with girl helps, everyone ends up happy.
If you're interested, ""Joe"" looks fairly realistic, especially for the time this flick was made.

If you are a fan of Disney movies in general, or you like their Animal Kingdom theme park, you will probably really enjoy this movie. My kids loved it too. There are a few emotionally tough spots, so be sure to watch it with them. But like most Disney movies, just about everything works out to a happy conclusion.

1009794,3,6305320950,"This update of the 1949 movie Mighty Joe Young is nowhere near as good as it could have been, but it is good enough for a family evening of DVD viewing. I don't think kids under ten years old will notice it's deficiencies, most of which are caused by a far-fetched, predictable plot.
In a situation obviously taken from Gorillas in the Mist, a woman scientist studying mountain gorillas in Africa is killed by poachers. This being a Disney production, she has her young daughter with her. The mother is gunned down while fleeing with a baby gorilla they have named Joe. Her dying request is that the child forever protect Joe. [Remember, I said kids would really like this movie. In fact, my brother and sister-in-law loved it. Of course, they also raved about George of the Jungle.]
The daughter, Jill Young, grows up to be a strikingly beautiful young woman. She should be, since she is played by Charlize Theron, who is reminiscent of a young Rita Hayworth. Joe, a genetic anomaly, also grows up. He winds up being a 2,000 pound gorilla. Jill apparently never left the African village, and her education must have come from the scriptwriters. Jill and Joe are still best friends and run around playing hide and seek.
Enter Greg [Bill Paxton], a doctor of something or other, who has come looking for a rumored giant gorilla. He finds Joe, who would have stomped on him, if Jill hadn't come along. Greg convinces Jill that Joe would be safer in a wildlife refuge outside of Los Angeles. She finally agrees, and somehow they transport the huge animal without anyone finding out. The writers certainly had no idea how this was done. In one scene, Joe is in Africa. In the next, he is in a big rig on an LA freeway.
The refuge is full of stock characters. There is the kindly but incompetent Director. We have the Chairman of the Board, who is interested in Joe only as a way of getting donations. The villains, of course, are the very same poachers who devastated Jill and Joe's lives. Joe recognizes them before Jill does. This is one smart gorilla, and he soon escapes, reeking some wonderful havoc on, appropriately enough, Hollywood
Both Paxton and Theron are excellent actors, and they do their very best with the material they were given. Their careers remain in great shape.
Both the regular and the computer special effects are excellent in Mighty Joe Young. While I was watching it, I didn't think the African scenes looked very authentic. As it turns out, the movie was filmed in Hawaii.
Again, kids will thoroughly enjoy this adventure. Parents should find it tolerable, except for those who are like my brother. He thought it should have been nominated for Best Picture. His thirteen year old just rolled her eyes.",1017187200,,2726,4.68125

I was expecting a King Kong ""rip off"" which had been  given a Free Willy style plot, that would be purely for kids.  The main  problem I usually have with movies about Gorillas, and associated this with  Mighty Joe young, is that they seem to be the one animal that effects  people still haven't quite been able to perfect yet and always feel fake.  In fact the only reason I watched this movie in the first place was because  I was bored and my friend had left a copy at my house...oh the joys of  fate!
This is an enchanting tale that will capture kids and adults  alike, with its story of a giant gorilla that is taken to America to keep  it ""safe"" away from poachers.  But of course, things don't go as  planned  and a heart warming struggle to help Joe find safety and happiness  ensues.  It basically is an alternative telling of the King Kong story, but  it does with grace and a charm that only Disney can provide. The beautiful  Charlize Theron is perfect in her jungle woman role and works superbly  alongside Bill Paxton.  Although the effects still aren't perfect, they are  the best gorilla effects I have seen in a movie; at least they don't make  you cringe.
The sound and picture quality on the dvd are very good, but  the extra features (or lack of them) lets down the film.  An insight into  the effects would have been good, but no, you have to make do with a poxy  trailer and featurette.  But don't let this put you off.

The problem with Mighty Joe Young is the poachers that  are tied in with the story.  At times when they are hunting and harrasing  poor Joe, the movie switches gears from a sweet and tender story of an  oversized gorilla interacting with his ""adopted human parents""  into a disturbingly dark and cruel poaching free-for-all.  I wanted to see  more of how Joe lived in his natural habitat (a lush tropical jungle).  Those scenes provided breathtaking scenery and allowed you to escape into a  landscape of green mountainous terrain filled with other wild animals and  exotic birds.  I also wanted to see more interaction with Joe and the other  characters who were not trying to harm him.  I thought the performances by  Bill Paxton and Charlisse Theron were as good as they could be, their  characters were a bit mild however. On a positive note, the special effects  were extrodinary. (Mighty Joe Young was nominated for an oscar in the  ""best special effects"" catagory). There are also some touching  moments when Joe is bonding with the humans.  But unfortunately there just  aren't enough of these scenes to go around.  If you must get your gorilla  fix, check out ""Congo"".  Sorry Joe!",932601600,2,1354,4.708154506437769
