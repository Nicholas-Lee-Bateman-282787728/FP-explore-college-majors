8493010,5,B001NJ68S0,"Over the past 10 years, I have worked and lived abroad in Europe and Australia. I am now contemplating a move to China, however as I recognize that China is a whole other ballgame to Western society and business, I watched the series On the Frontlines: Doing Business in China. The DVD's were very informative and insightful. I feel much better prepared as well as more excited in pursuing business opportunities in China. I highly recommend this series for anyone wanting to do business in China.",1231200000,3,497,4.790697674418604
