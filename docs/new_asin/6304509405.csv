900973,5,6304509405,"I was never a fan of neither star of the Beautician and the Beast, but after watching it on TV I became and addict to Timothy Dalton. This is a very romantic comedy but one has to look deeply into the feelings of  Pochenko and Joy, he is a grumpy  teddy bear that loves his children but  tries to appear tough and mean and we have to understand his loneliness and  lack of romantic love in his life until he truly falls in love with a woman  that changes his way of thinking and humanizes him and on the other hand,  Joy fulfills her love not only with a man that very much needs her but with  his children that eventually will become her family.  After buying the  video and watching it numerous times, I think this is a great movie but has  been underrated and criticized for Fran's voice which she can help and is  one of her main charactericstics. Ever since, I am forming a collection of  videos of this great actor Timothy Dalton, ah! that voice and his looks!  But mainly what an performer! . I recommend this movie but please read in  between the lines all the mixed feelings including her parent's feelings  and mean old jealous envious and devious prime minister, what's his name?  Ira is delightful and so are the children! Also the music! I even bought  the soundtrack, the waltz is beautiful!",913161600,4,1305,4.393305439330544
900974,4,6304509405,"If you are a Fran-fan buy this! It is just great. It`s a story about a  beautician , Fran ,or in this movie Joy Miller. She get`s the job working  for The man that is like the king(ofcourse he isn`t but is in charge of the  country) of the fantasy land,Slovetzia. She get`s the job as a science  teacher for his kids. But actually that was the subjekt dhe flunked in at  school. The ending is a little sudden but still.... It`s a great story.  END",909446400,,447,4.1395348837209305

901047,5,6304509405,"*When I need to  leave my life's stresses behind, there is nothing better than a good romcom & a bottle of wine. It's hard to find a well written romantic comedy. Really thought this one was perfect. The female lead (Fran Drescher) was charming, good hearted & had some very funny talents. I would never have thought to cast Timothy Dalton in this, but he was absolutely perfect as the rough as coal, but loveable dictator.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Russian/American culture clash in this movie & thought the script was well done. You may think it odd, but I've watched this movie 5 times since it was made & enjoyed it every time. I feel sure I'll  watch it again at some point. It's just that great!*",1518307200,,702,4.46875

I have fond memories of this movie from when I was younger and was greatly looking forward to adding it to my DVD collection to enjoy over and over. HOWEVER, this ""DVD"" is a knock-off, that doesn't even play in my DVD player. Waste of time and ruined expectations. And this is an ""Amazon's choice""??? Thanks for choosing to rip-off people.",1515456000,,371,4.470588235294118
901089,3,6304509405,"I suppose Fran Drescher is an acquired taste. I sat through this film in order to see Timothy Dalton - nice change to see him play comedy, rather than costume drama. He's brilliant and charismatic in almost everything he's done, and he comes through again. Sweet ending, but this formulaic project could easily have been a Hallmark Channel film. The jokes are so dated it's embarrassing. If you don't care for either of the leads collectively or individually, skip it, because it's time you're not getting back.",1515024000,,511,4.885057471264368

901097,4,6304509405,"A funny film regarding an imaginary yet true to form Eastern Europe dictator and a beautician who is mistaken for a science teacher after a harrowing escape from a fire in her classroom.

This was genuinely a funny film that didn't get a whole lot of attention or play, possible because of the situation in Yugoslavia at the time, which decayed into a social disaster beyond the scope of this film.

Timothy Dalton plays the dictator for life in Slovenia, and has his servants seek solutions and people for his problems and that of the nation he rules.  Enter Fran Dresher's character who uses her working class New York Jewish wit to bring some grounding to said dictator's children and his nation as a whole.

The film had some real genuine funny moments as well as some Hollywood cliches.  It is, after all, a movie.

A decent rental.  I'm glad I finally saw it.  A light hearted romantic comedy with a unique twist.  Check it out.",1507248000,,934,4.578313253012048

I've watched it many times because it gives me joy.  It's amazing that Timothy Dalton (the Beast and the dictator of a Eastern Europe Country) cannot intimidate Joy Miller, the ""teacher"" for the his children...no matter what he does or says because of her innocent honesty.  I wish Fran Dresher had more movies out.  AND it's a family movie, too!",1432425600,2,479,4.654761904761905

I have yet to see him in any production where he isn't totally riveting, regardless of whether he's the hero, villain or in this case, a bit of both. And then add being drop dead gorgeous with that stunning vocal instrument. I envy all his female co-stars - I love the way he cradles their heads (a Timothy Dalton trademark!) while kissing them.
Truly a vastly underrated actor. Not to take away from Fran Drescher and her comedic skills - but this film belongs to Mr. Dalton.",1425081600,4,650,4.470588235294118

Timothy Dalton's character is completely over the top and tv-sitcom unbelievable, he barks, shouts, and doesn't seem real at all; however Fran is so likeable, warm, and believable in her role that it is still enjoyable for light, funny, romantic fare including children. The contrast between her New York City apartment life and family (her mother is also well-portrayed and hilarious!), and the setting in the Eastern bloc ... castle... is great and Fran's character is spontaneous, outrageous, and make you laugh outloud. You'll identify with her easily. I love this theme, even in silly comedies.",1421020800,,811,4.970588235294118

The movie works in the sense that Fran's character has a purpose that I could relate and she is such a warm and caring person it's easy to enjoy her role. She does a very good job in this movie as coming across as an activists for democracy but still unassuming and innocuous. The romance worked very good. The movie is clean and I would recommend for the whole family. Although, Fran's character is barely dressed and uses her body (which in my opinion is not all that great) to sell her politics, how hypocritical can you get! That's Hollywood in the modern era, sell their liberal ideals with sex and cutting apart conservatives (I'm referring to the scene showing Newt Gingrich). If they would have omitted that one scene I would have given the movie 5 stars. Hollywood should make movies for entertainment not politics.",1412294400,,849,4.629139072847682

They persuade her to go to their country, and the laughs just keep rolling from there.",1382745600,,506,4.340425531914893

I had no idea I was ordering this from another person, or that it could only be played in another country(this is America, you would think if you bought something in America it would play in America), and I thought I was dealing with Amazon, not some vendor!

902466,5,6304509405,"When our local TV station broadcast ""The Beautician and the Beast"", I set the old VCR to record it, thinking that it would be an updated version of the old animated classic, ""Beauty and the Beast"".

Boy, was I surprised when I sat down to watch it - and most pleasantly so!  I had always loved Fran Drescher in the TV sitcom ""The Nanny"" (although how's that voice?!  Is that her natural speaking voice?), but was never too wild about Timothy Dalton as Bond.  However, Dalton played the part of Boris Perchenko brilliantly.  His public persona as this tinpot dictator-turned-democrat in the post-Iron Curtain era contrasts brillintly with that of recently-widowed father, who finds love in the unlikely form of his childrens' teacher, Joyce Miller (Drescher).

There are some brilliant comic moments.  The envoy's hyperventilating gasps when he discovers that Drescher teaches beauty techniques rather than science defies the stereotypical USSR-era style of gathering information.  Drescher's complete fearlessness when facing up to Dalton - can you imagine acting in this manner towards Stalin?  Adding to this is the idea that simply clipping a moustache would chang a dictator's whole image - picture Hitler without his trademark lip covering?  I don't think so!

There are also some tender moments for the tissue-brigade - Dalton tucking his children into bed is one example, as is the ""prince in shining armour"" scene at the end when Dalton comes over to America to whisk Drescher off in his arms, having completed the transition to democracy in his country.

Don't take the politics of the movie too seriously - after all, if Mikhail Gorbachov or FW de Klerk were confronted by a woman like Drescher during the time that the Soviet Union and South Africa were going through their reform processes, who knows how history could have turned out!!!

It's probably not classic comedy, but I enjoyed it enough to purchase it on DVD.  It's good family fun (which is hard to find nowadays), and fans of ""Down Periscope"" (Kelsey Grammar / Lauren Holly) will enjoy it for its offbeat humour and fairly strong supporting charachers.

But if you disagree with me, ""talk to the hand...""",1168300800,3,2178,4.9944598337950135

But instead her co-star is Timothy Dalton. And once again, Fran is hired to work with kids/teens, but as a tutor and not a Nanny. Joy Miller (Fran Drescher) is a Beautician, who also teaches night school which as to do with cutting hair. She applies for a job, which requires her to do the woman who runs the New York Lottery, but she isn't chosen for it. And then a smoking misheap, leads the school to be set on fire, all the students leave, and starts to save the animals's life in the classroom, bu keeping entering and existing burning building until she gets them all out of the classroom.

902469,5,6304509405,"""The Beautician and the Beast"" is a warm and surprisingly touching romantic comedy/drama.  It's a modern day cinderella story as well as a variation on the age-old ""Beauty and the Beast"" fable.

Fran Drescher as Joy Miller is a delight as the beautician from Queens who is stunning to look at but whose voice is a distinctive blend of nasal/New York.  Believing that she is a public school teacher when in fact she is a beauty school teacher, Joy is mistakenly recruited by a representative of the dictator of a small eastern European country as a  teacher for his children.  The dictator is played by Timothy Dalton who somewhat resembles a youthful and very sexy Laurence Olivier.  There is  ferociousness tempered by a childlike vulnerability in Dalton's vigorous performance.

Joy may not have a university degree in education, but she has plenty of street smarts.  She has a patient and understanding nature yet doesn't hesitate to speak her mind especially when a wrong is committed. Joy makes an enduring impression upon the dictator's children and especially upon the tyrannical father himself.

This movie improves with age because it reminds us that entertainment  does not have to be profanity-laced, violent, or sexually explicit to hold your interest.  Instead, its depiction of people and relationships is gentle and humane.  Additionally, ""The Beautician and the Beast"" is a visual treat with impressive photography, sets, and costumes.  It also has a lush and romantic musical score.

Amongst so many unimaginative, big-budget Hollywood movies and their equally unimaginative, big-budget sequels, ""The Beautician and the Beast"" shines like a diamond in the rough.  It's a film that your whole family can watch and feel good about.  What a rarity!",1161043200,9,1762,5.169611307420495

Though this movie never gained much acclaim while in the theaters and after its release on video, I found it to be quite entertaining. It certainly isn't an Oscar contender, but it is intrinsically brilliant. Fran Drescher is irresistible as the beautician, and it surprisingly easy to love Mr. Porchenko as well (especially after he forsakes his moustache for the purpose of softening his image, courtesty of Joy).

This is such a funny movie-- Fran Drescher is the main draw, but Timothy Dalton as the angry, dictator/president father of three is hilarious as well. There's one scene where he tells one of his advisors to ""Talk to the hand."" It's funny because it's a rigid Timothy Dalton doing this. And also because NO ONE does this anymore.

Drescher stars as Joy Miller, an aspiring beautician. While she's teaching a beauty class, the classroom goes up in flames because a student was smoking and caught the mannequin head on fire. Another student attempts to put the fire out by using a can of hairspray. Oops. Joy saves the animals that are in the classroom and ends up on the front page, and because she's such a dedicated ""teacher,"" is offered a job teaching the children of the Slovetzian president, Pochenko (Dalton). Joy has several meet-cutes with this seemingly cold, brutal president, who acts more like a dictator. We come to find that he's not as rigid as we think.

It's Beauty and the Beast meets The King and I. It's not executed as well as the previously mentioned, this movie stutters through their romance (remind me why she instantly likes him so much??) and there's an unnecessary story about a ""rebel"" boyfriend of the president's daughter, which turns into a giant rigamaroll.

However, she does very good job in the role of a New York City beautician who is mistakenly recruited as a teacher for the children of an eastern European dictator played by Timothy Dalton.
Much of Drescher's comedy is geared around, believe it or not, her voice.  It has an Elmer Fudd quality to it--especially when she laughs.
Drescher goes with the flow in attempting to teach Dalton's four children, but goes well beyond the three Rs--much to his consternation.  Still, her down to earth style slowly wins Dalton's heart and transforms into something of a more acceptable world leader.

In this delightfully frviolous romantic comedy he plays a stern Eastern European Dictator whose heart is softened by the feisty New York girl he engages as governess for his children.  The plot is extremely silly but who cares, it's funny and romantic, a sort of whimsical updateing of 'The Sound of Music' (thankfully without any singing).  The scene at the ball where Dalton suddenly sweeps the girl into his arms provoked an involuntary whimper of excitement and envy from me, causing my oldest son to exclaim ""Oh honestly, Mum"" in that disgusted tone teenagers are so good at.

Location aside, I have to laugh at all the snippy internet reviewers of this movie in general, who want to hold up Fran's acting in comparison to the standards of a Carole Lombard or a Mae West.

Strange how these same reviewers have no problem agreeing that terrible actresses like Paltrow and Kidman should have Oscars shoved at them, with no comparison of them to real actresses like a Katherine Hepburn or a Bette Davis.

Anyway, it's just supposed to be a light comedy, so lighten up!

This flick, which is The King And I meets Beauty And The Beast, is all about Fran, so hang the rest. If you're not a fan, get over it and go watch something else, without raining on the parades of others.

But if you're a good little Nanny nosher, then there is nothing but enjoyment to be found in the lighthearted banter and cute outfits that our favorite Flushing girl offers.

Even the political slant of poking fun at dictators has taken on more relevance in recent years, if one wants to look closer at the plot. But who cares about dull things like script construction when there's so much of gorgeous Fran to see?

Naturally, though, all us Nannyholics have been waiting impatiently for the widescreen DVD release of this movie - so get on it, you lazy studio execs out there!

UPDATE: On June 24, 2003 this movie indeed WAS released on  a wonderful widescreen DVD! Thank you, studio folks!

Oy, I know there's no original trailer, so it doesn't get five stars, but I've changed my earlier 3 star rating to a 4 since there IS audio commentary by the fabulous Fran herself! So enjoy!",1048723200,6,1716,4.5210355987055015
902605,1,6304509405,"This seems like a plot constructed to string one-liners together.  Fran is charming, but eventually, it just becomes predictable.  The kids are reactionary, and not very belivable. Since its a romantic comedy you know what's gonna happen, the journey should be interesting, but its not.",1022112000,3,286,5.333333333333333

Joy Miller (Fran Dresher) is a struggling makeup artist from Queens who is mistaken for a highly intelligent teacher and taken to the small European kingdom of Slovetzia to teach the three eldest children of dictator Boris Pochenko (Timothy Dalton).
The children blossom under her unethical guidance while the cold Boris slowly falls in love with the pert and perky Joy.
Featuring Lisa Jakub (MRS DOUBTFIRE), Heather deLoatch (A LITTLE PRINCESS), Phyllis Newman (MANNEQUIN) and Ian McNiece, THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST is a delightful comedy favorite.",988848000,19,749,5.097560975609756
902609,2,6304509405,"Fran Drescher is an interesting actor, in that she doesn't so much do the same schtick in everything she does as play exactly the same character, a brass-plated beautician from Queens whose irresistible charm blows like a cheery breeze through the stuffy household of yadda yadda yadda.  In this film, it's supposed to be the household of a Slavic dictator, but it all looks a bit Prisoner of Zenda to me, especially in the uniforms.  (High collars and fencing went out with the Romanovs, guys.)
This is a two-star movie because, while it's not exactly awful enough to shout and swear at, it's certainly awful enough that the fact of its existence, soberly considered, is a serious misdemeanour.  ""The Nanny"" was pleasant enough in its WASP setting, but placing the same character down in a totalitarian society is a major lapse of taste.  I mean, where are the holding cells?  Where are the death squads?  Where are the State Security Police?  The random shootings?  The ethnic violence?  The villain is that nice Patrick Malahide, the hapless lech from ""The Singing Detective"", who while he does have the physical appearance of a party functionary, is too good to be doing stuff like this.  (Maybe he had kids' dental bills to pay.)
The whole thing is like some nightmare dreamed by Stanley Donen after a night of Andrzej Wajda movies and too many beetroot milkshakes.  I predict a limited life for it on early Saturday evenings.  Which, oddly enough, is when I saw it.",973296000,3,1471,4.7936507936507935
902610,5,6304509405,"What can I say, I LOVE Fran Drescher.  It might seem biased, but this movie is great!  It's basically The Nanny done up for a full screen with Timothy Dalton playing a tyrannical Max Sheffield and Drescher in her usual role, only this time a Beautician.  Funny, cute and lots of Fran.",967852800,4,284,4.423076923076923
902611,3,6304509405,"Fran Drescher is a beauty school teacher transplanted to Slavic Europe in Anna and the King of Slavitsky, or Beautician and the Beast, whatever they decided to name it, an obvious knockoff of The King And I.  He's a power  monger, she's a bright American who softens and civilizes him.  Very  comforting to the American ego.  Some of the movie is funny, some is  stupid, some is boring, and it has the big emotional ending.",960768000,,423,4.573333333333333
902612,5,6304509405,"This is a wonderful Cinderella story if ever I've seen one.  Mistaken identity, a teacher of cosmetology becomes a teacher of royalty.  The children in the movie are great, and I took an instant liking to the  youngest girl, due to the fact that she was a ""big, beautiful  woman.""
Timothy Dalton was spectacular in playing the stubborn,  nonsympathetic king of his country, who had no clue as to what his staff  were doing behind his back.
Fran Drescher was magnificent, and even in  her Queens behavior, innocent, but strong-hearted.  She was the perfect  match for this king who realized after meeting her that he could not live  without her.
I would hope everybody will watch this beautiful, sincere  love story, and recommend it highly.",960076800,2,740,4.84
902647,2,6304509405,"Think Cinderella for lonely yentas and you get this crooked picture. Drescher is Joy Miller, who, after rescuing some bunnies from the beauty school where she teaches, is enlisted by an emissary from Slovetzia, an  eastern European country where the iron curtain hasn't been fully drawn  yet. Her job? No, not pedicures. She's to teach the repressed children of  Boris ""The Beast"" Pochenko, a grumpy, Stalinesque leader played  by Timothy Dalton.
Joy gets cutesy-cuddley with the president's kids and  still finds time to talk to the common people (Yo! It's Evita from Queens).  Bypassing all boundaries of movie realism, Joy somehow endears herself to  Boris. For his part, the cold as ice commander strokes his bushy mustache,  gobbles one of Joy's delicious sandwiches, and ponders a former Communist  country with the gum-chewing shrew as his first lady. Predictable, eh  comrade?
Apart from the Drescher's missing-in-action talent, The  Beautician and the Beast suffers from an utter lack of inventiveness: the  proletariat is oppressed, the prime minister is the snarling villain, and  the children are sweethearts who just want daddy's love.
The only thing  that keeps the silly enterprise afloat is Dalton. He, at least, looks like  he's having fun putting on the hokey Baltic accent. Even with the stinker  dialogue he's handed, the former 007 appears to enjoy hamming it up.
The  Beautician and the Beast isn't exactly endearing Valentine's Day  entertainment. In fact, if I took my wife to this one she'd probably ask  for a divorce and demand half of what I own. She'd deserve it all and then  some.",953164800,12,1611,5.099616858237548

Non-fans of Fran can't really expect to enjoy it, as it is very much her movie, but she  carries it brilliantly. Laughs are aplenty and the romance is kept at a  sweet, innocent level. You can't help but be drawn in - it's certainly one  to watch time and time again.",946857600,5,398,4.2105263157894735

They are a great comedy team and belong together on the screen for many more movies. This is one of the best movies  that I have seen in years. ""Talking to the Hand"" is a classic  comedy device that will be remembered and imitated for years to come.  Dalton continuously proves he is perhaps the best actor today, though  greatly underrated. His flair for comedy that was magnificiently  demonstrated earlier in HAWKS should not be overlooked by producers,  directors, and audiences. I have seen 99% of Dalton's films and his superb,  acting skills distinguish all his films. Certain reviewers' nasty remarks  about Fran's accent and New York style are indicative of the prejudices of  meanspirited turkeys. She remains a gifted actress worthy of challenging  parts. Additionally, this is a family film that everyone can enjoy.",941500800,23,929,5.0927152317880795
