8580486,3,B00CDBV3TQ,"This war film has a no plot and some action but focuses rather on the daily lives of the soldiers of WWII. Its a realistic look at what a G.I. endures each day during the war. Lots of time in the rain and mud. This film has some historical interest in that it was filmed right at the end of the war, and it features some of Ernie Pyles original writing when he was embedded with the troops, but it is dated, slow-moving and of only average interest.",1484092800,,449,4.113636363636363
8580487,1,B00CDBV3TQ,I wanted to give it half a star but couldn't for some reason. Why do you guys sell this stuff if it won't play on US dvd players? Seems to me that should be made a little clearer/,1478131200,2,179,3.736842105263158
