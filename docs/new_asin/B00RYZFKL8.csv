8696427,2,B00RYZFKL8,"I like movies about disasters. But this was a disaster of a movie. So much bad science, bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. Normally I am very forgiving minor plot flaws, occasional stiff dialog, and a smattering of sub-par acting. But this movie was saturated with shortcomings. The only reason I didn't give it one star (instead of two) is that it had Christopher Judge (albeit his performance was quite lackluster too).",1438041600,3,429,4.890410958904109

8696431,3,B00RYZFKL8,Not that bad for a B movie about earthquakes. The story is typical and the special effects are great. A copy of this one resides in my massive library.,1435536000,,151,4.241379310344827
