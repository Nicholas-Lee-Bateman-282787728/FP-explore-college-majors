8710274,4,B00VJ49UY8,"Roderick Strong had his first P.W.G. Championship defense against a man who had a standout rookie year earning the shot in Trevor Lee in a strong back & forth match that featured several counters & reversals with fighting out in the crowd & wrestling in the ring.  Monster Mafia made their debut against the Young Bucks in a match that both teams using similar strategy from unique double teaming moves to using their opponents against each other while also having the most awkward Eddie Guerrero tribute you've ever seen.  Other matches include Ricochet vs. Matt Sydal in a very athletic match showcasing both mat wrestling & high flying, Drew Gulak vs. Chris Hero in a ""teacher vs. student"" match that was both technical & hard hitting, ACH vs. A.R. Fox in a evenly matched contest, Trent returns to P.W.G. after 8 months with an injury to team with Chuck Taylor as Best Friends against the Beaver Boys making their P.W.G. debut in a competitive contest with entertaining moments, Cedric Alexander vs. Tomasso Ciampa in a competitive match, and Mike Bailey making his debut vs. Biff Busick with Bailey showing offense that hasn't been previously seen before.

A lot of the regular P.W.G. roster wasn't available for this show making the room for a lot of debuts making strong first impressions & was a strong show but not the blow away type of show this company has made a reputation on. In the end, you can never go wrong with P.W.G. but this was a step down from their previous outings.",1433635200,,1490,4.723076923076923
