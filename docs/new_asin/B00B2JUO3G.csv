5553087,5,B00B2JUO3G,"This is a well-made film, with Chris Kattan playing a very believable set of twins, who are separated at birth and manage to switch places for a short time, with hilarious results! Chris does a great job at playing the ""everyman"" you might feel a bit sorry for, whether he's the psychiatrist or the ""slow"" twin (who really isn't that slow!)

I miss Chris' ""Mango"" and ""Mr. Peepers"" SNL characters, but really didn't think about them much at all during ""Crazy Enough.""",1364169600,2,467,4.695121951219512

5553100,3,B00B2JUO3G,"There is obvious talent here but at the same time it shows some are still working to master their craft.  The writing just isn't there getting close but the scene cuts seemed to amplify every weakness. If these folks were working on some type of series I think they would get there about mid-season.
The sound was the weakest link. There were places where the music/sound effects would have best been left out. The synthesizer stuff detracted and annoyed pulling focus from the performance just when the movie was working.
Still not a bad group effort that easily manages to be family friendly. There is a lot worse prime filler out there.

5553143,1,B00B2JUO3G,"Found this movie to be offensive and insulting to the seriously mentally ill and to their providers.  Mental illness is a huge handicap and not a subject for tasteless comedy.

5553145,1,B00B2JUO3G,"I tend to trust Amazon reviews, and make my purchasing decision based on these reviews. I have never been so disappointed as this time. I watched the movie to the end hoping there will be at least one scene that would make me laugh, but there was none. This is obviously a very low budget movie, but even then one would expect more. Chris Kattan was unconvincing in either of the two key roles, one of the psychiatrist and one of the mental patient, acting as if he was in a thriller rather than a comedy. The plot was too shallow for a thriller and the acting was too serious for a comedy.",1391126400,,590,4.230088495575221

5553150,5,B00B2JUO3G,"I just watched the movie earlier today & am getting ready to watch it a second time-rented it from Red Box & am keeping it an extra day we (my 15 yr. old daughter & I) enjoyed it so much!  I had never heard of Chris Kattan since I never watch SNL, but I really enjoyed his 2 characters-Fred &Ted-in this movie. One of my favorite parts is when Ted says a very, VERY long prayer over the family dinner. He literally thanks everything he can think of-very funny. My daughter loved & rewatched the scene where Ted gets rid of the teen daughter's date when he sees him pressuring her. Throughout the movie is a message about the importance of family & really being there for & truly appreciating each other. Now I am going to get back to re-watching my rental, & soon purchasing the dvd to have all the time as one our favorites!",1370563200,2,825,4.254777070063694
5553151,3,B00B2JUO3G,"Ted and Fred (Chris Kattan) are twins separated at birth for some unknown reason. They do not know the other one exists. Fred is a psychologist while Ted is a mental patient. Fred visits the institution to sign papers and through a series of improbable circumstances they swap places, very much to the dismay of Fred. There is also a subplot involving Dolores (Brooke Anna Leedy) a patient who Dr. Fred had to sign papers to continue being committed, someone he has never talked to and is apparently sane.

Fred has been in the dog house sleeping in the guest room, so when Ted shows up, there is no hanky-panky keeping the themes relatively kid safe. There were some good scenes, but most of time I saw missed opportunities. For instance , they both snoop through files. This would have been better if they showed this as a juxtaposition to show the similarity of the twins in different situations. In fact the whole film would have been smarter and funnier had they followed that formula. Likewise, they should have used known stars as inmates, create more diverse characters and allow the stars to showcase their egos and talents. Really? What is Robin Williams doing now a days?

It is a film for family night, good for a few laughs. Don't expect a lot.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1367193600,7,1302,4.6521739130434785
5553152,4,B00B2JUO3G,"Honestly, the movie itself was not great as one would expect of a straight to DVD production.  However, Chris's performance is  always enjoyable as he is just a naturally funny guy.  I am writing this review  to simply vent my indignation at Hollywood's general ignoring of this great talent  WTF!!! Come on, when I see so many mainstream major comedies that star actors, many of whom  don't hold a candle to his gifts, it  makes me sick and makes me wonder?  Shame on you, the powers that be, for letting such talent  go relatively untapped.",1366848000,3,542,4.621052631578947
5553153,2,B00B2JUO3G,"I felt compelled to write this when I saw all the 5-star reviews. I don't like writing bad reviews but I think it's fair to say that this movie is not great and it's not a 5-star movie. (For comparison, not even How to Kill a Mockingbird gets 5 full stars!)

The premise is good, and it's a version of the familiar Prince-and-the-Pauper trope. Sure, there are plot holes, and plenty of things are never explained, but those things can be forgiven if there are lots of laughs. Unfortunately, that is not the case here. There are some, but they're few and far between. And, at 1:45, it's about 20 minutes too long.

The bottom line is that there's a reason this movie was straight-to-video. It's perfectly pleasant, and if you're a big Chris Kattan fan (as many of these other reviewers seem to be), then that's probably reason enough to see it. Otherwise, give it a miss.",1365724800,6,870,4.5
5553154,5,B00B2JUO3G,Can I just say that Chris Kattan is the funniest comedian out there. I am so excited to see him in this DVD two Chris' makes this DVD even more thrilling.

5553155,5,B00B2JUO3G,"Fans of Chris Kattan will love his newest movie, Crazy Enough. Two twins, separated at birth, lead very different lives: one is a psychiatrist with a family, and the other is a patient in a mental hospital. When their paths intersect, the ensuing confusion leads to hilarious hijinks!

If you are familiar with the SNL alumnus Kattan, you will appreciate the zany humor in this film. His quirky characters ensure that every moment will make you laugh. Despite his age, he still remains one of the funnier actors of this generation. After seeing this on VOD, I can' t wait for the DVD to come out!",1365465600,,596,4.622641509433962
5553156,5,B00B2JUO3G,I saw this film on VOD and pre-ordered the DVD due to the fact that I am a huge fan of Chris Kattan's old SNL comedy sketches. The movie was surprisingly entertaining and made me laugh out loud on multiple occasions. Chris plays a double role as a psychiatrist who gets accidently mistaken for his twin brother who has spent his entire life in a mental institution. The other characters in the institution are incredibly humorous and turn out to be great sidekicks in his big escape so he can return to his normal life with his wife and two kids. You get double the dose of humor with the wacky twin duo played by Kattan; certainly a great film that can be enjoyed by all!,1365379200,3,672,4.341269841269841
5553157,5,B00B2JUO3G,I just got the film off VOD and I loved it! With Kattan playing the roles of both Teddy and Fred we get double the Kattan pleasure. I have been a fan of Kattan's acting for years because of his work on SNL and A Night at the Roxbury. Kattan stays in character the whole time and has a hilarious delivery. This film is perfect for family movie night. I recommend everyone see Crazy Enough!,1365379200,,388,4.1866666666666665
