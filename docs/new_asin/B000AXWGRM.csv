I loved this show as a kid and I'll have an excuse to buy a dvd player!",1126569600,8,110,3.5833333333333335
2394915,5,B000AXWGRM,"Finally disney releases Chip & Dale's Rescue Rangers & DuckTales on DVD!  My VHS tapes were dying from over use!!

In this series the classic Disney chipmunks Chip & Dale join Gadget, Monterey Jack & Zipper to fight the bad guys!  Great for kids, great for adults & animation fans!  Comedy, Adventure, Action & more it has something for everyone!!  The character of Gadget became so popular that Disney created a ride for her at Disneyland & Tokyo Disneyland - the only TV themed attraction!!  In fact, Rescue Rangers participated with other Disney Afternoon shows from the late 80's & early '90s like Gummi Bears, DuckTales & Tale Spin to have ""Disney Afternoon Ave"" at Disneyland!  This show definitely has it's fan base!

These guys are great!  This is a must have for animation fans, especially if you enjoy The Disney Afternoon cartoon shows & classic Disney animation!",1124928000,9,874,4.851351351351352
2394916,5,B000AXWGRM,"Man. . . Normally, I don't do reviews, but for this, I make an exception. CDRR is arguably the best animated series ever produced by Walt Disney Company. Anyone that doesn't buy this is missing out!

And for those that would argue that this isn't #1 out of the Disney vault, need I remind you that this series spawned the only character ever created exclusively for a Disney Afternoon show that got their own ride at Disneyland: Gadget!

For parents, many of you may remember this series from when you were younger. Share it with your children. Disney, once upon a time, was a family company, and that meant the whole family, not just those under 7. You'll enjoy this as much as your children do, believe me :)",1124928000,16,710,4.496124031007752
2394917,5,B000AXWGRM,"Why three ""yeses""? Because one of the greatest Disney TV cartoons ever is finally coming to DVD!

I was expecting these cartoons to come out in like 2009 or 2010 or so as like a 20th Anniversary edition, but I'm so glad Disney decided to release cartoons like ""Chip and Dale"" and ""DuckTales"" like now!

Even better is that we get these DVDs first! Which is good, because Disney always releases the good stuff on DVD in Europe and Australia first, I wonder why? But anyways, expect a whole lot of episodes (about 22 or so) on this volume, games, and a whole lot more!

And please, Disney, release ""TaleSpin"" on DVD too!",1124496000,10,618,4.451327433628318

This box set is great!  The box is plastic, not one of the cheap cardboard ones.  The episode quality isn't perfect, due to the show is so old, but it is about as clear as it can be.  The sound quality is ok too.  I forgot how funny the show is!  My 6 year old really likes it so far and I am happy this set was made.",1474588800,4,494,3.5943396226415096

I mean there is a slight grain to the video like a VHS, but it isn't bad considering that it is an older show. Disney seems to give little effort when it comes to their dvd releases of older cartoon shows and lesser known movies (Brave Little Toaster DVD is TERRIBLE quality!!!). That said, I still recommend this set to anyone interested in the series and hope Disney lets volume 3 see the light of day soon!",1462579200,,564,4.4326923076923075

I hate the way modern cartoons exploit bathroom humor and rudeness instead of using good ol' slapstick Looney Tune humor. I despise shows like Sponge Bob and the iCarly mess where all the kids are sooooo much smarter than the stupid adults. Ranting aside, these strong feelings caused me to seek out a better alternative for my kids to watch on the long road trip to our vacation destination. I found this little gem on amazon. I grew up with the rescue rangers and love them dearly! My kids now love them too. Good, clean cartoons with good messages!

Of course the DVD quality is much better that VCR tapes ever were and especially since ours are so old. Only complaint is that I wish you got the entire season on set of DVD's instead of being broken down into volumes. Guess they make more money that way.

2395068,5,B000AXWGRM,"Long before this show first aired on television, Chip 'n' Dale (voiced by Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton respectively in this show), got their start in the classic Disney shorts as comic foils for Donald Duck and sometimes Pluto. The success of the ""Chip 'N Dale vs. Donald Duck"" cartoons led the chipmunk duo to having their own series of cartoons that lasted for three films, the most famous entry being 1952's ""Two Chips and a Miss,"" where Chip 'n' Dale compete for the affection of a beautiful female chipmunk named Clarice. This cartoon show called ""Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers"" is what really propelled Chip 'n' Dale to super-stardom! This show introduces three new characters: Monterey Jack (originally voiced by Peter Cullen, and Jim Cummings in the later episodes), the brawny, adventurous mouse from Down Under who often has uncontrollably hypnotic ""cheese attacks"" whenever he sees or smells cheese; Gadget Hackwrench (voiced by Tress MacNeille), the lovely and intelligent female mouse and mechanic/inventor who can make very clever contraptions and vehicles out of old parts; and last but not least, Monty's diminutive sidekick, Zipper (voiced by Corey Burton), the housefly who, with his extremely small size, can do things that the other Rangers cannot do, such as unlocking doors that would otherwise require a key. The show mostly focuses on the Rescue Rangers as they work together to solve numerous cases that are often ignored by the police, while outsmarting a huge array of villains and scoundrels, the most frequent ones being the felonious feline named Fat Cat, and the power-hungry mad scientist named Professor Nimnul (both voiced by Jim Cummings). While the show has some humorous and tender moments, such as Monty's previously mentioned ""cheese attacks"" and Chip 'n' Dale falling head over heels for Gadget, this show teaches you this valuable lesson: it doesn't matter whether you're big or small. Helping those in need can be very rewarding and fun. I'd strongly recommend both DVD volumes of this classic show to all Disney fans, both old and new!",1439337600,,2080,5.102639296187683

2395075,5,B000AXWGRM,"Oh, my soul enveloped in the sweet memories when I see this cartoon. This is the original idea, which is still like both children and adults. Two cheerful and resourceful the badgers, with the help of their loyal aides, mouse and Zipper, they help the needy. It sounds funny, isn't it? But remarkably, the creators of the animated series, they managed to turn these show in humour, fun and interesting adventure. I still remember many series of this animated series and I'd love to see this cartoon again. Thank you, Chip and Dale!",1433462400,,531,4.720430107526882

2395174,5,B000AXWGRM,"As you may have deduced from 3 of my latest reviews, I love this show.  When I was young, I loved many of the Disney Afternoon cartoons, Ducktales being my favorite.  Acually it was Gargoyles, but Ducktales was my favorite of the funny ones, although I always thought Rescue Rangers had the best theme song.  I still enjoy watching all the series Disney has given box sets to, but I have to admit Ducktales isn't my favorite anymore but it's still great.  The thing is, the characters aren't as sympathetic as in some of the other shows.  Ducktales is just about the world's richest duck going around the world getting richer.  Not bad, but not as easy to root for as the Gummi Bears' quest to rediscover their past & protect the present, or the Rescue Rangers going around helping people, no matter how big or small the case is.  And it's not just that, the characters and their relationships with each other are alot more interesting, especially in CNDRR where they are the closest and strongest team I've seen in a Disney cartoon.  And Ducktales was funny, but I laugh more while watching the other ones.  And while Ducktales has good guest characters, few are as awesome as ones that the other shows bring in on a regular basis.  But enough DT bashing, I basically just explained how the Rangers came to be my new favorite.  I was surprised how much better this show was then I remembered.  I was even more surprised how many other people liked the show as much as I do (just look at the Acorn Cafe).  I guess we'll never get tired of seeing Chip N' Dale, along with the Australian-accented cheese-loving Moneterey Jack (AKA Monty), the beautiful (for a mouse) female inventor Gadget, & plucky fly Zipper fight the likes of the feline mobster Fat Cat & the mad human scientist Professor Nimnul.  So it's about time I review the series itself.

For synopsizes of the episodes, I'm going to borrow Monty Moonlight's (with some editing here & there) & give my 2 cents on each one.  I was going to use the ones from Wikipedia, but they just changed the episode guide to an episode list!

Disc 1:
1. Catteries not Included: When the Rangers investigate the case of a little girl's missing cat, they discover a scheme by the nefarious Professor Nimnul.  This is the actual pilot for the series, & it is great.  A
2. Three Men and a Booby: During a disastrous trip to the local supermarket, the Rangers stumble onto the case of a nervous Booby Bird's egg-napped egg! Chip, Dale, and Monterey soon find themselves clueless egg-sitters, and now they must rescue the mother bird from a maniacal egg collector!  This is a little too silly.  There are a couple funny moments, & the eagles are cool characters, but this isn't an episode you'll be playing again anytime soon.  C-
3. The Carpetsnaggers: While the Rangers attempt to thwart a rash of robberies involving seemingly ""magic"" flying carpets, Monterey and Gadget debate the nature of the mysterious circumstances.  This is a great episode with a wacky invention that's actually very cool.  A
4. Piratsy Under the Seas: Frustrated with having to pick up after himself and follow rules, Dale is thrilled when the gang comes across the sea dwelling Pi-rats who live as they please and are eagerly seeking new members!  This is a good little adventure.  B+
5. Adventures in Squirrelsitting: After an encounter with Fat Cat results in the Rangers wrecking the home of some local squirrels, our heroes volunteer for babysitting duty to make up for the error. Things go awry, however, when teen Squirrel Tammy's crush on Chip lands her and her baby sister in the claws of Fat Cat himself! This episode features a rousing musical number and is a fan favorite!  Couldn't have put it better myself.  A+
6. Flash the Wonder Dog: Flash the Wonder Dog is a TV star and hero to fans everywhere, especially Dale, so when Fat Cat and his gang frame the animal actor in an attempt to ruin his career and take the canine populace down a notch, it's Rescue Rangers to the rescue!  Apart from how easily Fat Cat fooled the humans, this was a really good episode.  A
7. The Pound of the Baskervilles: To help a dog and his owner regain their rightful ownership to a vast family estate, the Rescue Rangers consult the books of Chip's own hero, Sureluck Jones, for help in finding the will and chasing off the greedy brother that has taken control.  This was the first episode I ever saw.  A
8. Parental Discretion Retired: Monterey Jack's father, Cheddarhead Charlie, blows into town for a visit and attempts to teach the Rangers a thing or two about adventurin' the Cheddarhead Charlie way!  The first of the 2 episodes with Monty's parents.  It's the lesser of the 2, but it's still good.  A-
9. Risky Beesness: Zipper falls head over heels for a pretty but snooty queen bee in search of her swarm. The Rangers soon find the bees in the control of an exterminator with dreams of being a female rock star with a Queen Bee theme.  I love Zipper, just like I love all the Rangers, & this is an excellent spotlight for him.  A+

Disc 2:
10. Bearing up Baby: In a real treat for classic Disney fans, Chip, Dale, and the gang encounter another old adversary of Donald Duck's, Humphrey the Bear, as he adopts the toddler son of a careless camping couple. It's up to the Rangers to save the baby from the well-intentioned bear and then save the bear from a trigger-happy posse of campers!  Humphrey Bear's shorts are by far my favorite of the Classic Disney cartoon.  They're the only ones that I think are actually funny.  B+
11. Out to Launch : A visit to a space-shuttle launching lands the Rangers in some real trouble when Chip `n' Dale end up abandoned in outer space!  The most boring episode of the whole series.  Seeing Gadget make a rocket ship out of garbage is cool, but that's the only good thing in this episode.  D-
12. Dale Beside Himself: Dale thinks he's living the sweet life when he convinces a visiting, shape-shifting space alien to take over his chores, but the alien has developed a taste for Earthly-living and suddenly wants to take over Dale's life on a more permanent basis.  A funny eisode with some interesting characters.  A-
13. Kiwi's Big Adventure: The Rangers have to convert their plane into a boat during an attempt to flee from an angry tribe of Kiwi birds with dreams of flight, but Dale is too busy faking an injury to help out in the difficult escape.
A
14. A Lad In A Lamp: Monterey Jack discovers a magic lamp on the docks that was meant for Fat Cat's evil clutches. After wasting his first two wishes on cheese and transportation, the genie within tricks him into trading places with his final wish. Now, Monty is the genie of the lamp, and Fat Cat is hot on his trail.  This is good, but for I have to admit I like the Ducktales episode Masters of the Djinj significantly better.  B
15. The Battle of the Bulge: The Rangers put Monterey on a strict diet and exercise regiment and quickly regret it while on the case of some fruit bat jewel thieves.  Not fantastic, but not bad.  B
16. Ghost of a Chance: The Rescue Rangers trail Fat Cat to London in order to prevent him from stealing the crown jewels, and, in the process, discover the ghost of one of Monty's long-dead ancestors. A really good spotlight for Monty.  A+
17. An Elephant Never Suspects: When peanuts go missing at the local zoo, a bull elephant names the Rangers as the culprits. To clear their name, the Rangers must discover the real peanut pinchers.  Another average eisode, which is to say good but not great.  B
18. A Case of Stageblight: A night at the opera makes the Rangers prey to an insane, sewer-dwelling alligator with dreams of theatrical stardom.  I always wanted to see the episode where Dale fought the alligator in the intro, & it did not disappoint.  This is the best episode on the set & my favorite episode of the whole series next to Good Times Bat Times.  A+

Disc 3:
19. The Luck Stops Here: A pitiful inventor with a troublemaking cat blames his failures on pure bad luck, but Gadget is determined to show this kindred spirit the light.  This episode si what I love about the Rangers; how they help people out.  A+
20. Fake me to Your Leader: Wicked Professor Nimnul invents a ray-gun that causes things to grow and uses it on some local pill-bugs in an elaborate alien invasion hoax. To make matters worse for the Rangers, Zipper gets zapped too!  A good focus on Zipper, & almost any episode with Nimnul in it is great.  A-
21. Last Train to Cashville: Investigating a little boy's missing train set, the Rangers track it to yet another of Fat Cat's robbery schemes.  I love most of the episodes focused on Dale, & this was no exception.  A
22. The Case of the Cola Cult: Just as Gadget is questioning her usefulness to the team, the Rangers encounter a disturbing cult of rats who worship the fizz of ""Kookoo Cola.""  Appropriately a cult classic among Rangerphiles, this is also Gadget's best episode.  A+
23. Throw Mummy From the Train: On a vacation to mysterious Egypt, the Rangers agree to help a mummy retrieve a ring from a thieving archaeologist's assistant before he mistakenly brings a demon sphinx to life!  I always wanted to see this episode back on TV (since clips from it played during my favorite of the intros) & was glad when I caught it one day, & it's still one of my favorite episodes.  It was so good some of the Disney Stores have a Rescue Rangers diorama based on this episode.  A+
24. A Wolf in Cheap Clothing: Dale's obsession with horror comics causes him to jump to supernatural conclusions when the team's investigation into some strange robberies put them on the track of a wolf who spends his nights as a free-wheeling human.  One of Nimnul's most ingenious schemes.  A+
25. Prehysterical Pet:  In his eagerness to have a pet of his own and prove he can handle the responsibility, Dale secretly takes in a tiny Dinosaur visiting from another planet, but the more the Dinosaur eats, the bigger he gets!  Another great, funny episode.  A
26. Robocat:  The Rangers discover a mechanical cat and attempt to find him a home, until Fat Cat reprograms him for his own purposes.  This was a surprisingly good episode.  The logic break with the talking dog at the end (if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about) brings it down a notch but not much.  A-
27. Does Pavlov Ring A Bell?: Chip `n' Dale are becoming more aggressive in their competition for Gadget's affections, and things only get worse when a lab rat named Sparky seems to be beating them both.  This is the perfect episode to end the set on.  Sparky is a great character.  A+

A darn food collection if you ask me.  I paid $20 for it, a dollar for every above average episode & 5 good ones for free.  If you like Chip N' Dale, you must get this set.",1365638400,,10802,4.517241379310345

2395190,5,B000AXWGRM,"In the late 80's Disney had success with Gummi Bears and Ducktales, they came up with another great idea for a TV toon about rodent investigators and heroes. Originally it was suppose to be a spin-off of ""The Rescuers"" with Bernard and Bianca with three new friends but the idea dropped, so they thought of having Chip (Voiced by Corey Burton) and Dale thrown into the mix with three new friends like Zipper the tough housefly, the beautiful Gadget Hackwrench (Voiced by Tress Macneille) and cheese-obsessed aussie mouse Montery Jack (Voiced by Peter Cullen) who go rescue those who are in need of help and to solve mysteries. Very similar to ""The Great Mouse Detective"" combined with ""The Rescuers 1 & 2"" and Scooby Doo, this is a very creative and popular show that has earned another fanbase like Gummi Bears and Ducktales. It all started with ""To The Rescue"" which was a TV animated movie pilot that aired earlier that year to high ratings thus made a series that lasted from 1989 till 1991 since then with quality disney animation and memorable chracters, not to mention that memorable theme song. I grew up with this show since they aired the pilot on TV back in March 1989 when i was 7 and loved it, Chip and Dale were always fave toon characters growing up as a kid as i watched their cartoons all the time on the Disney Channel and i had a crush on Gadget for she was one cute mouse girl.

We start off with our first episode known as ""Catteries Not Included"" where some of the city's cats are being kidnapped especially a cute kitten by a robotic dog made by an evil Professor Nimul as the team must save them before he does something fiendish, then we get "" Three Men and a Booby"" where a weeping mother Booby bird consults the rangers to find the fiend who has stolen her egg. ""The Carpet Snatchers"" deals with Professor Nimul returning as he makes special technological magic carpets to do crimes for him, followed up by ""Piratsy Under the Sea"" where our heroes end up in a garbage truck on the sea by accident when they stumble upon a group of pirate mice for they must get back home. ""Adventures in Squirrelsitting"" has our heroes dealing with babysitting two squirrel girls as the teen one named Tammy has a crush on Chip yet wants to prove herself that she is worthy to be as good as gadget until she gets kidnapped by a criminal named Fat-Cat and his goons as this episode introduces us to them. ""Flash The Wonder Dog"" which is one of my fave episodes has a popular TV dog superhero being accused of crimes he didn't commit as Dale who is a devoted fan must try to know who is behind all this, next we get ""Parental Discretion Retired"" has Montery's father who visits his son as he joins up with the heroes on another mission as they must find the ones responsible for making some of the clams and fish go crazy and finally on disc 1 is ""Risky Beeness"" has an insane scientist/female rock-star wannabe who has an experiment to make bees do her business for the queen bee wants them back with the help of a lovestruck Zipper and the rangers.

Disc 2 features ""Bearing Up Baby"" in which the gang go on a camping trip until they encounter Humphrey Bear who saves a small boy and befriends him, ""Out to Launch"" features Dale and Chip accidently launched into space around the Earth's surface for Gadget and Monty must find a way to get them down. ""Dale Besides Himself"" is about lazy Dale who feels forced until he meets luck with a shapeshifting alien creature who takes on his form then Dale gets kidnapped by aliens by mistake, ""Kiki's Big Adventure"" has the gang in Tasmania as their plane has been mistaken as a flying god by a group of wild Kiwi tribes but can they get it back? next up is ""A Lad in a Lamp"" where an old lamp with a genie in it gets released by Monty then accidently switches place with both as it falls in the hands of Fat-Cat but can Gadget, Chip and the rest save our cheese-loving hero?. Next is ""The Battle of the Buldge"" where Jamaican Fruit Bats are doing the evil deeds for Fat-Cat on stealing jewelery, ""Ghost of a Chance"" has yet more antics of Fat-Cat with his companions in England to rob special jewels in a haunted mansion as it's haunted by Monty's ancestor. ""An Elephant Never Suspects"" has a big shortage of peanuts for the Elephants at the zoo as the Rescue Rangers are accused of robbing them as they must try to clear their names and Alan Oppenheimer (He-Man/Bravestarr/She-Ra fame) guest stars and finally ""A Case of Stageblight"" features a talented alligator living under an operahouse who wants to do anything to be a star.

Disc 3 starts with ""The Luck Stops Here"" which has an inventor with bad luck and needs Gadget's luck for fixing his stuff, next is ""Fake Me to Your Leader"" has Professor Nimul with a giantic ray that accidently zaps Zipper to become bigger as he has an army of bugs to plan a fake invasion of aliens in the city to steal gold. ""Last Trains to Cashville"" has FatCat with his goons who steals a young boy's train to use it for robbing, ""The case of the Cola Cult"" is the best epsiode of the first season and most memorable with it's catchy tune about a group of soda worshipping mice/rats who are theives. ""Throw Mummy from the Train"" deals with a reluctant mummy who befriends our heroes as he must return a ring back from him before that person wakes up an ancient demon, next we get "" A Wolf in Cheap's Clothing"" where a zoo's wolf changes into a human like a werewolf does and Professor Nimhul is taking his wolf place at night to rob banks. Then we have ""Prehysterical Pet"" has an alien dinosaur that crash lands on Earth befriending Dale as the others must try to find his spaceship-egg to get back home, ""Robocat"" is preciously what you think it is about a mouse-exterminating robotic cat that gets a heart of gold as it must try to bring back a rich boy's fish back from Fat-Cat and finally ""Does Pavlov Ring a Bell?"" is about a lab rat that Gadget falls for until she learns his secret.

All amazing episodes on 3 discs and a must own for fans of retro animation and disney.",1301097600,,6066,4.423076923076923

Each episode is 22 minutes long with lots of fun and adventure with your two favorite chipmunks. All the episodes have the original opening and ending theme songs. I didn't notice any editing with the episodes, so I'm pretty sure these are uncut (feel free to correct me). There is no pilot episode included and there are no specials or extras in this set.

I remember watching this show when I was a little kid. This show brings back loads of nostalgia. I bought this for myself for my birthday yesterday and I'm very happy that I did. I will definitely buy the next DVD set and hope that Disney will release the final volume.

I have not been disappointed. Unlike many cartoons on today, Chip-n-Dale can actually be watched by children and parents don't have to worry about their child seeing anything inappropriate.

Chip and Dale are members of a detective squad which mainly consists of rodents. They go on missions to rescue pets, stop villains, and learn about themselves. And the great thing about it being on dvd -- no commercials.

2395205,4,B000AXWGRM,"I'll review three things here: the show, the DVD content, and the packaging:

The Show - While not exactly brand new, CDRR is a very good series. As opposed to cartoons today, it didn't feel the need to be explicitly educational. It also doesn't have 1.4 kadrillion product tie-ins to tempt the kids. And, once you get over the improbable stuff, it's fun for an adult (or at least me) to watch. The 5 rescue rangers have their distinct personalities that work very well together and the gags are funny even when you see them coming. Think of a less spooky ""Scooby-Doo"" where the crime solvers have real personalities and a little MacGyver thrown in. One more mark in its favor is that it deals with some serious themes at times, such as loyalty and integrity.

The DVD content - They have the ""first"" 27 episodes and...that's it.  Seriously, there's no other content on there except a few Disney previews and some menus based on the show.  The audio/video is certainly good enough for the kids to watch.

The packaging - Again, no frills here.  I like that they are thin cases and are fairly clearly labeled.  The front cover art is nice.  There are scenes on the backs of the cases that are taken from the episodes inside, though these are mostly (and obviously) drawn later and not from the original character models.

Overall - The show by itself is good enough to recommend a purchase and 4 stars.  The lack of extras on the DVD's prevents me from rating it higher.",1196553600,,1469,4.551330798479087

2395212,5,B000AXWGRM,When I saw this I just knew I had to get it immediately. Two of my favorite cartoons to watch when I was younger were Ducktales and this. I only remember bits and pieces of this but from I remember it was good. On a side note for some reason I don't feel a show is complete without a good theme song. This was both a good show and had what I thought was a really awesome theme song to boot. Five stars.,1168214400,2,402,3.855421686746988
2395213,4,B000AXWGRM,"I bought this DVD as an impulse purchase when Tower Records was going out of business.  I too grew up in the 80's and grew up with the likes of Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Danger Mouse, ducktales, He man, Inspector Gadget, Robotech...I can go on for days...

A lot of these DVD's have been remastered with better sound and visual quality than regular TV.  Unfortunitely, Disney seemed to just dub the Chip and Dale tapes onto DVD format.  The sound is also in MONO...which sucks if you have a stereo/Surround sound TV like I do.

The set also lacks the bells and whistles that you can find with the Disney movies, like commentaries, artwork, etc.

Still Chip N Dale is an enjoyable animated series, and reminds you back when Disney was original and top notch instead of being the hacks off of Japanese anime that they are today.  I still would watch this over Kids Next Door or Pokemon anyday!

I just wish that Turner (or who ever owns Hanna Barbera) would release the ""Kid"" versions that Rivaled Disney (i.e. Flintstone Kids) or maybe an ""Alf-the animated series"" box set.",1164067200,,1071,4.62962962962963

I give 4 stars for a couple of reasons:

1. Great collection

2. Brings back great memories

3. Shows not remastered, taken from tapes in a television studio that was going to air them but didn't, so the quality turned out to be VHS quality

4. I think Disney could have done more with menu

5. Mono surround sound?  I know tv shows weren't all stereo back in the 80's, but come on, the movie Bambi is in 5.1 Dolby!!!

6. What is up with the redubbed theme song?  On some, you can hear the sword fight without the swordfight video.  What gives??

2395222,5,B000AXWGRM,"Watching Rescue Rangers again for the first time since a good 17 years ago, it's surprising how much I actually remember of the show. It's not like I thought of the show every day since watching it, but my love for the show was apparently stored away in my brain, because upon watching the shows, I remembered what would happen in each episodes, even most of the lines, precisely. This is the kind of Disney cartoon that was made when the people involved making the show ACTUALLY cared enough to make an interesting show. I mean, the plots are still unique and enjoyable for my adult mind, even more so, because now I understand all the subplots, in-jokes, and hidden messages in the show that I would have never caught in my youth. It's not that the show had anything dirty, it's just that my young mind couldn't comprehend it at the time. Parents, pick this up for your kids. It's much better than anything they're watching on Cartoon Network. Cartoons today are made to sell the merchandise related to the show, and thusly, little thought goes into making a show with substance. Disney was the exception with these cartoons. Yes, these shows had merchandise, but it was not the focus. Disney made these because they wanted to keep constant appeal with their target audience, the children. Rescue Rangers is like an animated series of serial novellas, like the Allan Quartermain, or Tarzan books, but for children. Why are you still reading this? Buy it!",1139011200,27,1456,4.713725490196079
2395223,5,B000AXWGRM,"When I found out this DVD had been released in the US, I had to have it. So much so that I paid out for a multi region DVD player, just so that I could buy it! If you ever watched and loved this cartoon, it is a must buy. Many of these episodes I haven't seen for nearly 15 years, but they were still as good as ever. Memorable characters, memorable situations, humour, heart, a classic cartoon.

The price is excellent value too, for 3 discs and 27 episodes. No rubbish either, just pure Chip n Dale goodness. Episodes in this box-set are:

Disc 1: Catteries Not Included, Three Men and a Booby, The Carpetsnaggers, Piratsy Under the Seas, Adventures in Squirrelsitting, Flash the Wonder Dog, The Pound of the Baskervilles, Parental Discretion Required, Risky Beeness.

Disc 2: Bearing Up Baby, Out to Launch, Dale Beside Himself, Kiwi's Big Adventure, A Lad in a Lamp, The Battle of the Bulge, Ghost of a Chance, An Elephant Never Suspects, A Case of Stageblight.

Disc 3: The Luck Stops Here, Fake Me To Your Leader, Last Train to Cashville, The Case of the Cola Cult, Throw Mummy From the Train, A Wolf in Cheap Clothing, Prehysterical Pet, Robocat, Does Pavlov Ring a Bell.

Even if you are unfamiliar with this cartoon, or grew up without it, I would still recommend it, especially if you have kids of your own. One of the best cartoons of the 80s, if not ever, one of those cartoons with two levels of humour, your basic childish humour, as well as other jokes and references that are funny on another level to adults. Im 20 years old now, and I enjoyed it as much now as I did in 1989. I already cant wait for Volume 2.",1138492800,3,1627,4.392026578073089
2395224,4,B000AXWGRM,"Even at the age of almost 30, I still enjoy this series. The episodes are fun, unlike a lot of cartoons that you loved as a kid, but don't quite give you the same enjoyment as an adult.

Unfortunately, this isn't the optimal DVD set for fans. While it technically contains the entire first season (27 episodes), it is missing the first 4 episodes from the pilot, which introduces us to the characters and explains their relationships.

This DVD set also lacks any bonus features, which isn't uncommon for older shows released on DVD, but would be nice. Picture quality is fairly dull, but isn't necessarily bad either. It's basiclaly the same as it was when the show was broadcast.  Audio quality sounds like it has worsened in some areas though and been dubbed in others.  They just don't appear to have been enhanced at all for the DVD. The DVD set does include subtitles for the hearing impaired.

One of my main problems with the DVD set is the crummy box it came in. The set includes 3 DVDs, each in a cheap flimsy plastic DVD case, about half the thickness of a normal DVD case. These three cases are in a cheap cardboard box that doesn't look like it's meant to be saved. They could have easily put the three discs in one normal-sized DVD case with a flip holder on the inside, or at least put them in a decent box. The cases look awkward on my DVD shelf and are so thin I can barely notice the DVDs. Even AOl gives out better cases with their promotional CDs.

Overall, if you just want to watch the episodes, definitely get the set, however it would have been nice for Disney to have put some effort into the series and restore some of the picture quality and include all of the episodes.  It seems like they just slapped this collection together.",1137542400,9,1756,4.41795665634675
2395225,5,B000AXWGRM,"I remember the days of watching the `Disney Sunday Movie' and awaiting the classic Disney cartoons that would come on right after. My all time favorites were the hysterical romps of the mischievous chipmunk duo. When I found out that they were to star in a brand new animated series following `Ducktales', I was very interested to see how it would turn out.

Thankfully `Chip `N Dale's Rescue Rangers' became another successful Disney show that remains one of the biggest cult classics to emerge out of the late `80s. All of a sudden these two unruly rodents became small time (and I use the term loosely) crime fighters. Along with two mice and a fly, this band mystery solving critters got into capers way over their heads. Thanks to crafty wit and awesome gear made out pencils and paperclips, they always came out on top.

Don't expect any drug references or subliminal messages from this crime-solving bunch. The Rescue Rangers like `Ducktales' is wholesome entertainment for all ages. Having the first 28 episodes of this show released on DVD is a burst of excitement for me. It's great to know that shows like this one are being released so people can enjoy the phenomenal magic and fun that this show brought to the small screen. Now if only `Darkwing Duck' can find it's way to DVD that would make my day.",1136678400,,1314,4.683982683982684

Watching the show as an adult now, I can see that it was a good, wholesome kids show with good morals and positivity throughtout.  This is a show that you could definately let your kids of all ages watch without having to worry about subjecting them to questionable material (not like a lot of today's cartoons).  After all, it is Disney, so it is quality.  I'm glad they finally came out with a decent collection of the episodes!

2395227,5,B000AXWGRM,"There was a time when afternoon television programming was the highlight of the day for millions of young people across America. The reason for all this after-school joy: a very special programming block known simply as ""The Disney Afternoon."" Of course, the Disney Afternoon did not simply materialize out of thin-air. It was a gradual process to develop, and it all started with two very special animated shows, ""Duck Tales"" and ""Chip `n' Dale: Rescue Rangers."" First came ""Duck Tales,"" which blew fans away with animation and stories far superior to the programming that was standard afternoon cartoon TV fare at the time. Working with the classic comic book stories of Duck Family creator Carl Barks as a basis, Disney created a memorable and much-loved series that raised the bar for animated TV programming to a new high that later shows were frequently expected to reach. Two years later, Disney once again took classic characters and redefined them for the small screen, this time in the form of ""Chip `n' Dale: Rescue Rangers."" Rescue Rangers was an excellent follow-up to Duck Tales, maintaining the high animation and writing standards, and doing a superb job developing new and classic characters as well. Chip `n' Dale were every bit the same characters we all new and loved from their old exploits with Donald Duck, but now they were more distinct and ""real"" than ever before! Chip was more than ever portrayed as the bold and serious leader, while Dale took on his role as the adventurous slacker with all the seriousness of his crime-solving counterpart. Rounding out the team of miniscule crime-solving heroes were new characters Gadget Hackwrench, the beautiful mouse inventor, Monterey Jack, the burly Australian adventurer with a serious weakness for cheese, and Zipper, the tiny housefly with a gi-normous heart. Together, the little gang traveled to and from Ranger Headquarters in the Ranger-Wing, solving unsolvable crimes and helping poor souls in need with their individual skills and teamwork combined. Their enemies were often random nitwits and evil-doers, but they did have recurring baddies in the form of mad scientist Professor Nimnul and ruthless animal kingpin ""Fat Cat"" and his cronies.

""Chip `N' Dale: Rescue Rangers,"" just like its predecessor, ""Duck Tales,"" has finally and thankfully been released in its first DVD set. This three disc ""Volume One"" collection includes the first 27 episodes of the classic animated series from Walt Disney Television Animation Japan. The episodes are detailed below.

Disc 1:
Catteries not Included: When the Rangers investigate the case of a little girl's missing cat, they discover a scheme by the nefarious Professor Nimnul to use static electricity to power his newest evil invention! His source for the static charge: Kidnapped cats courtesy of his robot dogs!
Three Men and a Booby: During a disastrous trip to the local supermarket, the Rangers stumble onto the case of a nervous Booby Bird's egg-napped egg! Chip, Dale, and Monterey soon find themselves clueless egg-sitters, and now they must rescue the mother bird from a maniacal egg collector!
The Carpetsnaggers: While the Rangers attempt to thwart a rash of robberies involving seemingly ""magic"" flying carpets, Monterey and Gadget debate the nature of the mysterious circumstances.
Piratsy Under the Seas: Frustrated with having to pick up after himself and follow rules, Dale is thrilled when the gang comes across the sea dwelling Pi-rats who live as they please and are eagerly seeking new members!
Adventures in Squirrelsitting: After an encounter with Fat Cat results in the Rangers wrecking the home of some local squirrels, our heroes volunteer for babysitting duty to make up for the error. Things go awry, however, when teen Squirrel Tammy's crush on Chip lands her and her baby sister in the claws of Fat Cat himself! This episode features a rousing musical number and is a fan favorite!
Flash the Wonder Dog: Flash the Wonder Dog is a TV star and hero to fans everywhere, especially Dale, so when Fat Cat and his gang frame the animal actor in an attempt to ruin his career and take the canine populace down a notch, it's Rescue Rangers to the rescue! Another fan and personal favorite, in no small part due to the gorgeous actress character in the opening scene with Flash.
The Pound of the Baskervilles: To help a dog and his owner regain their rightful ownership to a vast family estate, the Rescue Rangers consult the books of Chip's own hero, Sureluck Jones, for help in finding the will and chasing off the greedy brother that has taken control.
Parental Discretion Retired: Monterey Jack's  father, Cheddarhead Charlie, blows into town for a visit and attempts to teach the Rangers a thing or two about adventurin' the Cheddarhead Charlie way!
Risky Beesness: Zipper falls head over heels for a pretty but snooty queen bee in search of her swarm. The Rangers soon find the bees in the control of an exterminator with dreams of being a female rock star with a Queen Bee theme.

Disc 2:
Bearing up Baby: In a real treat for classic Disney fans, Chip, Dale, and the gang encounter another old adversary of Donald Duck's, Humphrey the Bear, as he adopts the toddler son of a  careless camping couple. It's up to the Rangers to save the baby from the well-intentioned bear and then save the bear from a trigger-happy posse of campers!
Out to Launch : A visit to a space-shuttle launching lands the Rangers in some real trouble when Chip `n' Dale end up abandoned in outer space!
Dale Beside Himself: Dale thinks he's living the sweet life when he convinces a visiting, shape-shifting space alien to take over his chores, but the alien has developed a taste for Earthly-living and suddenly wants to take over Dale's life on a more permanent basis.
Kiwi's Big Adventure: The Rangers have to convert their plane into a boat during an attempt to flee from an angry tribe of Kiwi birds with dreams of flight, but Dale is too busy faking an injury to help out in the difficult escape.
A Lad In A Lamp: Monterey Jack discovers a magic lamp on the docks that was meant for Fat Cat's evil clutches. After wasting his first two wishes on cheese and transportation, the genie within tricks him into trading places with his final wish. Now, Monty is the genie of the lamp, and Fat Cat is hot on his trail.
The Battle of the Bulge: The Rangers put Monterey on a strict diet and exercise regiment and quickly regret it while on the case of some fruit bat jewel thieves.
Ghost of a Chance: The Rescue Rangers trail Fat Cat to London in order to prevent him from stealing the crown jewels, and, in the process, discover the ghost of one of Monty's long-dead ancestors.
An Elephant Never Suspects: When peanuts go missing at the local zoo, a bull elephant names the Rangers as the culprits. To clear their name, the Rangers must discover the real peanut pinchers.
A Case of Stageblight: A night at the opera makes the Rangers prey to an insane, sewer-dwelling alligator with dreams of theatrical stardom. They'll have to play-along if they're going to make it out alive!

Disc 3:
The Luck Stops Here: A pitiful inventor with a troublemaking cat blames his failures on pure bad luck, but Gadget is determined to show this kindred spirit the light.
Fake me to Your Leader: Wicked Professor Nimnul invents a ray-gun that causes things to grow and uses it on some local pill-bugs in an elaborate alien invasion hoax. To make matters worse for the Rangers, Zipper gets zapped too!
Last Train to Cashville: Investigating a little boy's missing train set, the Rangers track it to yet another of Fat Cat's robbery schemes, this one at least partly inspired by the 1955 film ""The Ladykillers.""
The Case of the Cola Cult: Just as Gadget is questioning her usefulness to the team, the Rangers encounter a disturbing cult of rats who worship the fizz of ""Kookoo Cola.""
Throw Mummy From the Train: On a vacation to mysterious Egypt, the Rangers agree to help a mummy retrieve a ring from a thieving archaeologist's assistant before he mistakenly brings a demon sphinx to life!
A Wolf in Cheap Clothing: Dale's obsession with horror comics causes him to jump to supernatural conclusions when the team's investigation into some strange robberies put them on the track of a wolf who spends his nights as a free-wheeling human. A fave among wolf and werewolf lovers like myself!
Prehysterical Pet: In his eagerness to have a pet of his own and prove he can handle the responsibility, Dale secretly takes in a tiny Dinosaur visiting from another planet, but the more the Dinosaur eats, the bigger he gets!
Robocat: The Rangers discover a mechanical cat and attempt to find him a home, until Fat Cat reprograms him for his own purposes.
Does Pavlov Ring A Bell?: Chip `n' Dale are becoming more aggressive in their competition for Gadget's affections, and things only get worse when a lab rat named Sparky seems to be beating them both.

Featuring some of the best voice talent in the business and spanning a total of 65 episodes, ""Chip `n' Dale: Rescue Rangers"" is high-quality Disney entertainment that can appeal to all ages, so long as the viewers are young at heart. Full of great memories for those of us who grew up with these fantastic programs, this 3 disc set is a must own, even if it is not everything the hardcore fan has been longing for. The source material could do with some restoration, white marks do appear frequently, and there is not an extra to be found (a crime in the case of a DVD boxed set). Of course, what concerns many of us the most is the lack of the five-part premiere, ""To the Rescue."" As with the ""Duck Tales"" DVD set, the 5-part premiere story is not included, which is most distressing, particularly since the 5-part premieres set up the entire series and are usually the best stories in the entire run. The only bit of hope I can offer the readers of this review is that some online episode guides for this show that seem to follow the same order as the DVD set list the series premiere eps as episodes 41 through 45, which WOULD put them in the second volume, assuming a second volume is released.  I can only assume the case is the same for ""Duck Tales."" Regardless, this set is fantastic if you are a fan of the show, even without any extras. A twenty-seven episode set for twenty-six bucks is a steal! Let's hope the remainder of the series follows, and let's hope it has some extras, but, in the meantime, I suggest you pick this one and Duck Tales Volume One up right away. I've heard that very few were made and production has already been cut off. I don't know if that's just a rumor or not. I was simply told by the retail store employee where I bought them that what are on the shelves now are all that are going to be sold. I'm sure glad I didn't take any chances! I've been enjoying these shows enormously since I picked up the sets the day they came out!",1132531200,77,10921,4.747235387045814
2395228,3,B000AXWGRM,"I just bought Rescue Rangers and took a quick run through the ""menus"" and a look at the image and sound quality. The image and sound is the same as I remember from them being on TV. Nothing amazingly clear, but still looks decent. The reason I put menus in quotes is that there really isn't any. The main menu gives you a play all feature, episode select, and setup which includes English subtitles and DVD registration. That's it. No extras, no commentary, and menu backgrounds are just low quality screenshots from various episodes. In every menu the Rescue Rangers theme plays without words and much louder than the episodes. It gets really annoying after a while. To top things off all the episodes 1-27 are not included, the first 4 were omitted. While I'm thrilled to get CDRR on DVD I'm extremely disappointed that Disney put so little effort into this collection. I can't help but feel this was just slapped together to silence CDRR fans. I'd like to think that Disney is testing the waters; the more of this volume they sell the more effort they'll put into the next. I didn't get the Duck Tails Vol 1, but I can only assume it's the same. All in all I'm very disappointed in the level of work Disney put into this. I would have been more than willing to pay an extra $10-15(US) more if it meant another disc filled with extras. They would be well advised to drop this whole volumes thing they've got going and release individual seasons with extras. The Disney Afternoon cartoons have a huge fan base and because of this dedication deserve more.",1132272000,10,1555,4.557142857142857
2395229,5,B000AXWGRM,"A superb collection, featuring all of the episodes that I (vaguely) remembered from my childhood, this is one helluva release from Disney DVD, and is sure to be a real bang for your buck at under $30 for 27 episodes.

Every time I pop one of these DVDs into my player, I find myself unconsciously dancing around and humming the theme song as it plays behind me just like I did when I was five years old. It's too bad that they didn't think to include the 'cut-to-commercial' and 'back-to-the-show!' cards that came on before and after commercial breaks, because they would have just served to amplify the nostalgia factor that much more.

Though I must say that I didn't really like the fact that several of the opening themes in some episodes were obviously remastered versions of the original. You can usually spot these fairly quickly over their authentic counterparts because the sound effects (the lightning crashing as the Ranger plane hovers through some craggly branches at the beginning, the growl of the alligator as he snaps at Chip and Dale, the bowling-pins-crashing-over sound effect when Zipper barrels through a group of  ""pie-rat""s, etc.) are missing from the song. It doesn't sound right without the sound effects! How I managed to remember all this after sixteen years is beyond me, but I was a die-hard back then, so I guess the fact that I paid an obsessive amount of attention to everything in the show makes a little more sense.

So to recap: no commercial cards, and the weird remastered theme songs don't sound so hot when compared to the original. These were my two minor disappointments, and to say the least, having 27 episodes of the ""Rescue Rangers"" at my disposal whenever I want them kind of glosses over any niggle I can manage to find. I was really worried that I'd find the show dated and lame once I saw them at my current age, but much to my delight, I can still get ridiculously wrapped up in the cute and quirky mysteries included in each episode.

If you were a fan of the Disney Afternoon Block in the late 80's and early 90's, you'd be nuts to miss out on this release. And hey, even if you weren't crazy about the Disney Afternoon, and are just a fan of high-quality animation when Disney was still concerned with making their syndicated TV cartoons look GOOD, you should really look into this 3-disc set. It's a delightful walk down memory lane.

Now if we can just get them to release a boxset of ""Gummi Bears""...",1131840000,8,2458,4.613272311212815

2395231,4,B000AXWGRM,"Following the success of DUCKTALES, Disney decided to attempt another TV series starring some of their beloved characters.  CHIP 'N DALE'S RESCUE RANGERS, which casts the titular quarrelsome chipmunk duo as a pair of crimebusting detectives, became yet another popular serial for the company's then-weekly ""Disney Afternoon"".  It is almost tempting to compare this show with DUCKTALES; after all, both series were produced within the same time period.

RESCUE RANGERS attains its own identity, however, due to its more comical tone, even with its fair share of action and solid mysteries.  Its great asset comes not from the artistic merits (which is par for the course or better than most Saturday Morning cartoon serials--produced once again by Tokyo Movie Shinsha, for the most part anyway) or the sometimes too-cutesy score (although the theme song *is* catchy) but from character development.  Instead of being the anonymous tormentors of irascible characters like Donald Duck or Pluto, Chip and Dale are given distinct personalities.  Chip takes his duty very seriously through and through while Dale relishes in clowning around in even the direst of circumstances.  Nonetheless, both remain steadfast friends and partners despite getting into occasional squabbles.  Their sidekicks include burly Australian mouse Monterey Jack (with an unfortunate weakness for cheese) and nonverbal yet steadfast housefly Zipper.  But my favorite character has to be Gadget, a resourceful mechanic who almost always has a great invention or idea to save the day and provides compassion to her companions.  She's quite attractive, too, hence why the ""chips"" tend to vie for her affection every now and then.  Even though she doesn't seem to mind when either of the boys flirts with her, Gadget never really takes their amorous advances seriously.  (Nor would I think she care to; after all, she IS a mouse.)

The bad guys our quintet of furry heroes battle are mostly random, however the most distinguishable of them is Fat Cat, a tabby version of Ratigan from THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE (his voice, supplied by Jim Cummings, somewhat recalls Vincent Price's sinister performance of that character) who delights in treasures and despises canines (as demonstrated in an episode where he tries to sabotage the reputation of Dale's #1 dog hero, Flash the Wonder Dog).  His comical baddie sidekicks provide a hilarious contrast to Fat Cat's devious demeanor.

This show has a lot of episodes that youngsters and adults can enjoy together; some of my favorite scenes include a hilarious dance number where Chip and Dale disguise themselves in drag; an opera disrupted by a stage-crashing, Thespian alligator; and desperate race to save astronauts from being lost in space.  Admittingly, some episodes are better than others (in particular, the one where our pals encounter Humphrey the Bear didn't really keep my interests), but CHIP 'N DALE'S RESCUE RANGERS has maintained a steady following of fans over the years, and for good reason:  the show is a lot of fun, and can even hold its own ground to many of the cartoons we see on TV today.

As with DUCKTALES, Disney has provided RESCUE RANGERS with its first ever 3-DVD set.  Fans have been awaiting this particular release for a long time, and unfortunately, it is not an altogether satisfying one.  Although the box set contains 27 episodes (out of the 65), it is puzzling as to why Disney would neglect to include the five-part pilot, ""To The Rescue"", among them (a similar problem the DUCKTALES DVD set suffered from), much less include any extras.  The set's only real drawback is the video quality, which, although adequate for the most part, suffers from annoying film artifacts (white speckles which appear in more than one episode).  It's not altogether unwatchable, but it is disappointing that Disney did not give the video a major clean-up.  However, the audio quality is acceptable, and the sheer fact that this show ever got released onto DVD at all renders such issues trivial.  Hopefully a future release of this series will correct this volume's problems and make the missing episodes available to more devoted fans.",1131667200,9,4170,5.143703703703704
2395232,3,B000AXWGRM,"Finally, the Rescue Rangers have come to DVD...But, if you're a true, hardcore fan you may be a bit disappointed.

First, the packaging.  Bundled neatly within the box are three separate containers with Chip, Dale, and Monterey Jack prominently featured on the cover.  On each container, one additional action picture on the front, along with the Rescue Rangers TV logo.  More pictures and episode listings are on the back.  These covers look nice, clean and crisp.

Something missing from this set is the individual episode descriptions.  No booklet or description on the disc of the individual episodes is included.

The episodes, themselves are taken from the master film footage, which, unfortunately have degraded a tiny bit over the last 16 years, or so.  White streaks and blips appear throughout nearly every episode.  The audio sounds great, however, as it is mastered in Dolby Digital Mono.

No special features, just 27 episodes on three discs.

I hope that a Rescue Rangers Volume 2 will be made.  If it is, I would like to see ""To the Rescue"" included, as well as some special features.",1131494400,33,1731,4.853242320819112
2395233,5,B000AXWGRM,"I was looking forward to this series on DVD a slight bit more than Ducktales. The video quality is alright but there's occasional speakles onscreen and a bit of artifacting in the digital image. Either way it's pretty good, I'm glad to own at least part of the series! The covers are really nice and also include the old art images from the original VHS tapes. To those worried about the lack of the original pilot movies, I'm fairly confident it will apear on a later volume, but probably only in the multi-episode format. I hope Talespin and Darkwing Duck are next on Disney's list for DVD release.",1131494400,6,600,4.564814814814815
2395234,2,B000AXWGRM,"This is a fine set for any kid. But not for fans. No, this set is lacking the first four episodes that establish the characters. For baffling reasons, the folks at Disney decided not to include these episodes. This makes the set less thatnm staisfactory, and wholly dissapointing.

The episodes weren't restored, and the sound is plain mono, but the fans will be dissapointed.",1131408000,14,376,4.875

2395236,5,B000AXWGRM,"I grew up watching many shows and I watch many new ones today, and this one was one of my top favorites,  for any fans of classics this shows is one I would highly recommend,  However, Disney's classics have also proven that the world is full of many whiny people who will not grow up as well, when changes were made on Toon Disney Channel to appeal a new generation of kids, many teens and adults are getting so upset and are making a fuss over many stupid stuff about it, So Fox Kids shows are now on the channel, SO WHAT?!  Disney owns Fox Kids, DiC shows used to be on the channel and that used to be owned by Disney and it's almost the exact same thing with Fox Kids, stop complaining, we have the DVDs here coming out, that's one reason that they exsist, this was a great show I know, while it is on at night when many of you teens may sleep for school or adults may want to sleep instead, that's because the channel is aimed at kids 6-11 years old and most of them are asleep at the time, so some of the people who grew up with those shows can may be awake at the time and enjoy those shows.  While Rescue Rangers is a great show, Just buy the DVD set and stop whining.",1130803200,2,1176,4.034334763948498
2395237,5,B000AXWGRM,"Has anyone noticed that a lot of these reviews are written by those who watched Chip and Dale as kids? o_O

Yes, I'm one of them.

This is going on my ""Must Buy"" list for sure. I realized how much I missed this show when I got the theme song stuck in my head and had to download it... and it escaladed from there. And since there's the special DVD package of Rescue Rangers and Ducktales, I can review even more of my archive of memories from the 1990's!

But in an attempt to be unbiased, this show really does have a lot. It's mostly humor and mystery (the writers were no Agatha Christie, mind you, but it's still amusing), and pre-CG animation. That makes a great series, in my opinion.",1130198400,9,690,4.251908396946565
2395238,5,B000AXWGRM,"It took me a bit of time to track down what's actually included in this DVD.  From what I can see, it's three discs with episodes 1-27 on them.  Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers lasted only one season, but from the reruns that ensued, it will exist in kids hearts for eternity. Most of the kids who watched it are now in college, thus this is a timely release; Anyone who knows college students knows that they will spend a fortune just so they can remenisce. Who knows how long we will have to wait for all 65 episodes to be put on DVD. At least we now have a piece of that television history and can show it to others.",1128816000,13,616,4.082644628099174
2395239,5,B000AXWGRM,"I was so happy when I learned that Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers is coming to DVD. This is an excellent show that I remember watching as a kid. We have a dubbed version here in Norway. In Norway we call this series ""Snipp og Snapp: Redningspatruljen"". Chip = Snipp, and Dale = Snapp. Rescue Rangers = Redningspatruljen. I hope Disney/Buena Vista will release this one in Norwegian also, but now I got a chance to watch the original version of ""Snipp & Snapp"".

This show, along with many of the other Disney Afternoon shows (mostly notably Talespin, Darkwing Duck and Gummi Bears) were like a necessity growing up. Now the first two most important shows are coming to DVD at long last.
