213669,1,6300158926,"The story of ""Oliver Twist"" is a great story, if you get the right version.

The 1948 version and the other versions are better than this 1933 version. If you have seen all the other ""Oliver Twist"" versions first, are a classic film buff, and have money to burn; this has a couple of good scenes with Oliver being poked and prompted by Bumble to speak, and Oliver doing tricks for the stagecoach.",1224028800,2,396,4.424657534246576
213670,1,6300158926,"First, let me say that although the back of this tape claims it is the first filmed version of Oliver Twist, there is a silent film starring Lon Chaney and Jackie Coogan which is on a nicely packaged DVD. This is, however, the first sound version of the film. That is perhaps the only thing it can boast, though it is obvious that the sound technology was not utilized.

We all know the story. Oliver Twist is a poor orphan boy who is treated badly in the orphanage, so he runs away and is roped into joinging a group of thieves. He maintains his innocence throughout and is a lovable character. This film follows that story pretty well and the adorable Dickie Moore is cast as Oliver.

Although I am a fan of Moore, I must admit that even his acting is wooden, a blanket statement for the entire cast. His acting is stagy and his short attention span gives the viewer the same.

Carl Pierson, the editor, did an atrocious job. Perhaps he was asleep as he was cutting the film; I would not be surprised. There are scenes that are too short and others that run too long, such as one where Oliver is scrubbing the floor as punishment. It seems the director has yelled ""cut"" because Moore looks up and smiles at the camera as if his job is done, and this is still in the film!

What is even worse is that the condition of the film is terrible. The print is awful; the picture is washed out and difficult to watch. The pre-recorded soundtrack is dully recorded to the point of being impossible to hear at times. This is an early talkie, so silence is often prevalant in films of the era, but not to this extent. With the television volume more than halfway up, it should be possible to hear at least the crackling of the film or the buzzing of a projector in the background.

I practically never do this, but I would have to say don't bother at all with this movie, at least not until it gets a better release. Not even intense fans of Dickie Moore like myself will be able to find something worthwhile here.",1153008000,2,2004,4.319148936170213
213671,5,6300158926,"Most of us had to read Oliver Twist in high school and we probably found the very long book to be tough going at that age. That said, the plot twists that make the book complicated reading, work very well on screen. The story itself is about an orphan who is a troublemaker but finds ways to make his life better, even though there are many bad guys and obstacles put into his path. This was made into a childrens musical called ""Oliver"" but I like this not singing version better because it allowed me to follow the plot more easily.",1148342400,,534,4.297029702970297
213672,5,6300158926,"""I guess most of us have read some version or the other of Oliver Twist in high school - but that won't prepare you for the raw pathos and display of courage in this fascinating feature film (Oliver Twist) from A2ZCDS. Dickie Moore brings the key character to breathing, bleeding life and I couldn't stop myself from hating his antagonists. This vintage movie is totally enchanting. I will not forget it.""",1146528000,4,405,4.71830985915493
213673,3,6300158926,"My three stars does not mean this film is as good as that.  It is because this short film was made back in 1933, and probably the oldest talking film based on Dickens (except ""Rich Man's Folly,"" freely adapted version of Dickens' ""Dombey and Son"").  The rendition is flatly done, and there is little I can recommend here except for the fact this is one of the oldest Dickensian films.
The story of the little boy, the fence Fagin, and criminal Sikes (and his dog) is preserved fairly well, but the film is an obvious attempt to cash in on the popularity of the child star Dickie Moore.  As you know, ""Oliver Twist"" was made with another (and more famous) child star Jackie Coogan in silent era (1922), and the film producers must have known that fact well.  Unfortunately, Dickie Moore looks too plumb and healthy to convince us that he is Oliver Twist, and in most of the screen time, he simply does not look suffering from his fate.
Other actors are not good either; Fagin is so-so, but is unmemorable before Alec Guiness, and William Boyd's Bill Sikes shows enough menace to scarethe kid, but his English sounds more like that of Humphrey Bogart.  If you want definite version of ""Oliver Twist,"" go to David Lean (or Elijah Wood version of 1997, if you like).
Strangely, the film is produced by Monogram Pictures, usually known for its B-program pictures, like Westerns or thrillers.  That fact might explain the poorly done production designs of the film.",1073260800,2,1459,4.657587548638133

7803809,3,6300158926,"Oliver Twist, 1932 film

Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse (a refuge for the poor). ""Its too late, Doctor."" ""It's the old story."" At age nine Oliver is sent to an orphanage to learn a trade and be educated. The boys get a bowl of porridge for breakfast. One boy asks for more. ""Lock him up!"" Oliver leaves and learns a lesson on his way to London. A man offers help and introduces him to Fagin. There are others there. Fagin teaches Oliver a new game. Nancy Sikes meets Oliver. A man's pocket is picked and Oliver is blamed! Cleared, Oliver is brought to a new home. Fagin wants to know what happened. Bill Sikes arrives with Nancy. Oliver has a new home with Mr. Brownlow. He is given the job of returning books, but is found by Nancy and taken back to Fagin. Nancy returns the books and money to Rose with an explanation.

Fagin buys ""used goods"". There is a plan for a burglary, they need a small boy. Bill Sikes carries a small pistol. Oliver will be pushed through a small window to open the front door. Something goes wrong! ""Why its Oliver!"" Fagin has something from Oliver's mother for which he expects a lot of money. Nancy meets Rose and her uncle to tell them the news. Is she watched? Charlie Bates reports to Fagin, who tells Bill about Nancy. ""Crafty."" Bill beats Nancy with a club. Now he is wanted and can be identified by his dog. Fagin was caught. Bill seeks a refuge with Fagin's boys. A crowd gathers outside in front of the house. Bill gets a rope to escape down the back wall. The Watch breaks into their room but Bill escapes them! Fagin sends for Oliver Twist and gives him that ring. Oliver shows Mr. Brownlow that ring, which identifies his parents (relatives of Rose and her uncle). Will Fagin be forgiven? Oliver will now be raised as a gentleman.

I never read the book but know the story. This is a simplified and condensed version, which tells of life in the early 19th century. Are things different today? When did they change and why? This movie was made during the Great Depression so the audience would have better understood the poverty shown in this movie. This movie omitted the plot to deprive Oliver of his inheritance by a relative who knew of his existence and tried to get him involved in crimes.",1358726400,,2242,4.423728813559322
7803810,4,6300158926,"It's always interesting to see a Poverty Row studio like Monogram adapt a classic novel, especially one by Charles Dickens. I've seen a number of film versions of ""Oliver Twist,"" and this one really works hard with the subject matter.

In 1933, Dickie was one of the star players in the Hal Roach ""Our Gang"" comedies. So Roach ""loaned"" Dickie for a hefty sum to Monogram so they could use his star power in their adaptation of ""Oliver Twist."" The film itself took about ten weeks to shoot, a long time by Monogram standards.

And Dickie Moore is so gosh-darn cute as Oliver that it's a shame he has so little dialogue in the film. For a character who is supposed to be in the foreground, we often find him in the background with other characters rounding out most of the dialogue. Not that Dickie is a bad Oliver, just one of the meeker, milder ones.

Director David Lean's classic 1948 noir version of ""Oliver Twist"" is my all-time favorite, with the gritty 1922 silent Jackie Coogan/Lon Chaney, Sr. version running a close second.

But in all fairness to this version of ""Oliver Twist,"" it is well worth watching. Also, it's interesting to see how Monogram handles a classic period novel with very little money. And, as with most low budget productions, this great cast takes their parts seriously and puts everything they have into them. Dickie does the best he can while the rest of the cast performs in true ensemble style to round out this entertaining film.

One main point here is that the story has been sanitized to a certain extent for this film. Possibly the producers wanted their ""Oliver Twist"" to be more of a ""family film."" So they toned down, and even changed, some of the more horrific parts of Oliver's experiences in the harsh, poverty-stricken world of England in the 1830's. There are still some acts of violence in the movie, but nothing compared to other film versions on the market.

So the Dickie Moore ""Oliver Twist"" is probably closer to a G-rated version than most other film versions, with the exception of possibly the ""Oliver"" musical.  Lastly, Alpha's DVD print and sound are good and that helps with the viewing experience of this interesting film.",1316563200,5,2182,4.696335078534031
7803811,5,6300158926,"This is a very well done version of Oliver Twist. I purchased this film because I'm a big fan of Edna Mae Oliver but I was blown away by the performance by the young Dickie Moore.  He is in a word..supurb. The supporting cast is spot on, too.  This was a real treat to watch.  Recommend it highly",1313193600,,296,4.068965517241379
