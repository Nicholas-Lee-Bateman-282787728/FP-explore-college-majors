8289854,4,B001CUB5FQ,"Very interesting show. I still watch it frequently.
  I really don't believe they were absolutely sure he had syphilis- he had some of symptoms but not all of them.
  Regardless he had numerous health issues and kept his doctor very busy and his doctor had him hooked on all kind of goodies!
  But the signs of Parkinsons disease was really obvious in this DVD- but then again his body was never found  and no autopsy was ever done- they believe his body was burned so that Russia couldn't drag it around and display it.",1411344000,,520,4.468085106382978
