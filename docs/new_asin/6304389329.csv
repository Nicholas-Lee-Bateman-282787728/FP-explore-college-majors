856253,4,6304389329,"In this 4th installment of the series, Director Misumi Kenji was replaced by Saito Buichi -- although I feared the series' quality would deteriorate, I was pleasantly surprised at the nuances Saito lent in his own adaptation.

 Still only a third of the way through the manga series myself, ""Baby Cart in Peril"" adopts episodes from early volumes and introduces a later (for me: unknown) episode that involves (finally!) a showdown between Ogami and Retsudo!

 As usual, the film does a good job giving screen time to other characters allowing them to develop. O-Yuki, the assassin willing to bare her vengeance, is a powerful and interesting character. Daigoro gets more and more screen time as in this movie for the first time, he wanders off alone. The little boy is so charming in this film (like the third installment) -- I love his scowls: talk about inhabiting a character. Combined with the nearly concrete stare of Ogami (actor Wakayama Tomisaburo), this movie confirms it still has the magic. Somehow these nearly opaque actors convey incredible emotion. I just wish I knew what Wakayama was looking at -- he never eyes the action or the camera directly.",1093132800,,1164,4.923469387755102
856254,5,6304389329,"I think this is the best of the first 5 movies released on DVD.  The subplot of Diagoro's separation and the main plot of Oyuke's quest are accurate translations from the stories in LW&C Book 4.  All of these movies are terrific, and now that the 6th movie has been released, this series is now preserved as one of the best samurai action/historic epics on film.",1091318400,3,362,4.46969696969697
856255,5,6304389329,"This film may be my favorite of the whole series. This film features such an accurate representation of issue #23 of LW&C: performers, and the story itself is very moving. O-Yuki is a very sympathetic character that whose quest for revenge is even more admirable than Itto's as she was not only disgraced but violated as a woman. (...) The ending battle scene is also magnificent. (...) While the battle is not as visceral as the one in the previous entry or part 6, this film's battle is still quite magnificent.  As I said before, this is my favorite film in the whole series though all of them feature spectacular amounts of bloodshed.",1080259200,8,638,4.646017699115045
856256,5,6304389329,"This 4th in the Series, brought to you by the folks that let you know sword fighting was a messy and WET business, begins with a lovely young woman, topless and tatooed, slicing up some men in tip-top fashion.  Our hero, the implacable and stone-faced Ogami Itto, former Shogun Executioner presently master ronin assassin, will be hired to dispatch the young lady to the next world.
This entry is the first not directed by Kenji Mishimi, and is told a little more elliptically with many flashbacks that fill in more detail on the backstory of the Yagyu Clan's enmity toward Ogami Itto that lead them to murder his wife and set him and his young son on the road as ""demons at the crossroads of Hell"".  Lord Retsudo, Itto's arch enemy, reappears and there is much clan intrigue and skull-duggery going on.
There is still plenty of fighting and bloody mayhem, a fight in a temple has Ninja arms and legs being lopped off willy-nilly left and right.  There is a lot of spraying blood, but there is  also the same attention to period detail and the explanation of customs & codes of this long ago civilization, helped by great Liner Notes & Subtitles.
It all climaxes with a hellacious fight with Ogami wiping out another army of opponents, but this time by using the terrain of  gullies and ravines to his advantage.  He ends the fight by taking Retsudo's eye but is badly wounded himself in the process.  But, of course, he will live to fight another day.
Graphic & fantastic, serious and silly, the Lone Wolf & Cub series is a kick if you've a mind for it.",1019433600,23,1554,4.5285714285714285

7869326,4,6304389329,"After spending a few movies on the lam, picking up odd jobs and dispatching would-be assassins, wandering ronin Ogami Itt gets back to the business of stalking his real enemy: Retsudo Yagy, who dishonored Ogami's name and orchestrated his wife's murder. The two finally cross swords this time (with consequences for both), but not before Itt deals with a disgraced, grudge-bearing former rival, a femme fatale with curious tattoos, a corrupt local official (complete with his own private army) and a host of explosive-lobbing foot soldiers. And, for once, the harsh lifestyle has taken a toll on our swordsman: the lone wolf that stumbles away from the battlefield at the end of this film is a far cry from the one who stoically, almost carelessly, dealt with blade-flinging challengers at its onset. Stuffed with fascinating, well-rounded new characters, unique fight scenes, badass acts of heroism and gallons of bright red spray, it's incredible that the final running time comes in just short of ninety minutes. Feels like there's enough depth, and enough story, to have stretched for twice as long.",1491523200,,1103,5.133333333333334

7869333,5,6304389329,"Here's a lesson in the value of reading on-disk liner notes.  There are four short pages of notes on Animeigo's version of LONE WOLF AND CUB: BABY CART IN PERIL.

 Page one tells about the Mountain Witch and Kintaro.  Both legendary figures in Japan.  The mountain witch, or yamauba, is the `fairy of the mountains,' old and haggard in appearance with a thin face and wild white hair. The mountain witch cares for the mountains; kintaro is a child of super-human strength and skills, something like our Paul Bunyan, I guess.  Important stuff to know because the character Ogami Itto (Tomisaburo Wakayama,) the ronin Lone Wolf, has contracted to kill (for the usual 500 pieces of gold) is the beautiful young Oyuki, who has been slaughtering the Yagyu clansmen sent out to assassinate her.  Oyuki has a tattoo of the Mountain Witch on her back and one of a nipple-seeking Kintaro covering her chest.  Besides being a superbly skilled warrior, the lovely Oyuki will distract her opponents by removing her blouse while in battle. Whatever it takes to awe and shock.

 Page two describes the `Yagyu New Shadow Style' of swordscraft.  Lone Wolf and Cub is set in 17th century Japan, and every episode I've seen so far - this is my third - concentrates on sword fighting styles and techniques.  The New Shadow Style is the type favored by Yagyu Gunbei, Ogami's bitter rival.  Ogami, as we're reminded in every film, was the Shogun's Official Executioner until betrayed by the pernicious Retsudo.  Gunbei was a disciple of Retsudo's, and he fought Ogami for the Executioner position and, save for what may have been a technicality (watch the film and decide for yourself,) defeated Ogami.  Although each film in the series tells a particular story - in this case that of Oyuki and Ogami's contract to kill her - they all also flesh out the big story.  I really should have started these in sequence, but I've been picking them up haphazardly.  In any event, the Gunbei-Ogami rivalry is fleshed out in this one, even though it hasn't a whole lot to do with the main story.

 Page three tells us about the goumune, or `street beggars,' of feudal Japan.  Lone Wolf and Cub spend a lot of time traveling through the poorer communities of Japan and observing the outcasts and the looked down upon.  As the goumune clan leader observes to a rude Yagyu thug sent by the Shogun to bring Ogami back, in a speech that distantly echoes words Shakespeare wrote for Shylock, the goumune may be reviled and looked down upon, but they eat, drink, and expel waste like any other human.  And, like any other human, they value courtesy and a show of respect. Translated into terms I can understand - roughly and imperfectly translated, I realize - the goumune are something like the dirt farmers in westerns.  Like I said, it's a rough translation - goumune are valued less than `human beings,' according to the notes, at a ratio of about 7 to 1.  Still, in terms of firepower a group like the Yagyu clan - Ogami's chief enemies since the betrayal that forced his with-cub exile in a land between heaven and hell, between life and death - a group like the Yagyu clan have it all over the goumune.  Not unlike the big bad ranchers pushing around the frightened and huddled sod busters in a lot of westerns.

 We learn the Owari fief was a major commercial crossroads during the time the events in this movie took place on page four.

 Lone Wolf's willingness to mingle with and befriend, and at times defend, the despised, sets him apart as a true samurai.  Or a classic cowboy hero, come to think of it.  He's imperturbable to the point of being a sphinx and proficient as heck with the sword.  There's a lot of blood in these movies - when a bad guy gets his legs cut off at the knees the prop department empties a couple of quarts of krylon red #5 all over everything.  In this movie alone I'd guess they were buying the stuff in 50-gallon drums. It may have played brutal in 1972, but it just seems a little cartoonish today.  Not in a bad way, mind you.  Lone Wolf and Cub was born of a Japanese comic book series and these movies are vividly visual.  If the strange names and customs make watching this movie sound like work, it's not.  They're a lot of fun, very well produced, visually pleasing, and containing a hero-and-a-half you can root for.",1153699200,5,4328,4.588541666666667
7869334,5,6304389329,"This movie is maybe the best of the Lone Wolf and Cub series and I tell you why:

- I saw four movies of Lone Wolf and Cub:

* WHITE HEAVEN IN HELL is good because Ogami Itto (main character) use everithing he got to kill the bad guys but that battle is more like a Ski battle in a snow mountain.

* LAND OF DEMONS is also good because Ogami battle many enemies in a big dojo with one sword like Uma Thurman did in Kill Bill and he use the lance only a few times.

* SWORD OF VENGANCE is the original and he only use the sword and the lance like in LAND OF DEMONS.

* This one (Baby Car in Peril) is the best because he use the sword, the lance, the machine gun, the two swords, small shurikens and blades like in WHITE HEAVEN IN HELL but this time the settings are in a war camp.

THAT'S ALL FOLKS  Thank you for lisen!!!!",1096761600,2,823,3.863095238095238
