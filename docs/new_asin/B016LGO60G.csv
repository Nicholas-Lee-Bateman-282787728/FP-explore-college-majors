7475653,1,B016LGO60G,"What a GOD awful movie! Horrible 'acting', if you can call that acting. DO NOT waste your precious time on this LOSER of a movie. Wash the dishes,do laundry, anything except this!",1459900800,3,179,4.625
7475654,3,B016LGO60G,"this is a very unique and well made psychological thriller. If you are patient, not that the film is slow by any means, you will be rewarded.",1459296000,3,141,4.2592592592592595
8736739,3,B016LGO60G,"Not too bad, but does have major plot holes!  One illogical (and unrealistic) decision after another.  But then again there would be no story if it was actually realistic.",1525564800,,171,4.862068965517241
8736740,3,B016LGO60G,"This is an interesting movie but it didn't have enough change throughout the story line and setting. It's okay to watch just didn't grab my attention completely.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suburbanite/dp/B01DJNAQ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suburbanite</a>",1486944000,,305,9.2

8736742,4,B016LGO60G,"Suburbanite is the ideal concept for an indie thriller. It has few characters, few sets, and few effects. Instead, it depends heavily on story and acting and it delivers on both.

As for weaknesses, the script does seem to make some leaps in logic that are never really explained and there are a few scenes that seem padded in the dialogue. There are moments when the acting feels campy, particularly in the filler scenes.

All of this is easy to overlook. Jodie Moore steals the show as a man struck by a car and hidden away in a garage. A thoroughly enjoyable film and director Andrew Lohrenz is to be commended",1464825600,2,613,4.513513513513513

8736745,1,B016LGO60G,"Boy, I've seen a lot of stupid movies, but this one takes the cake. Not sure if it's a high school film project or what, but man it was BAD. Can't believe anyone would waste money making such a dud as this. Don't waste your time.",1462579200,,229,4.0
8736746,4,B016LGO60G,Liked it till the end... Wish there was more to the end.  Left me wondering what he's going to do next to make things right.,1462492800,,124,3.96
8736747,4,B016LGO60G,"A film with a different slant, this thriller keeps you watching all the way through.  A family man hits a pedestrian and takes him home in his trunk, planning to bury him in his yard.  But it turns out the guy isn't dead.  Two more characters are mixed in the plot who are after the pedestrian and track him down to the garage the family guy has him in.  Suspense is high when all the characters are together in the garage:  Who will kill who? Who will survive?

I found a part of the movie that didn't really work.  The guy who was hit by the car is supposed to be ""dying"", yet he doesn't even seem like it.  He has plenty of pep when he needs it, and for a person who is supposed to be ""bleeding out"", I didn't see hardly any blood.  Also when the guy is found to be alive, especially when he tells the family man he walked in front of his car, there is no reason for him to get help for the guy's injuries.  The injured man has a cell phone and could have just called 911.  The excuses for these major flaws were weak and, if fixed, could have taken this average movie into the 'real good movie' range.",1462406400,2,1105,4.046082949308755
