8525430,2,B0085AXS7O,"Because of the title, Pas Fiddle, and the background of the storyline, I thought this production would be a rustic tribute to a fiddle. Instead, it is a production of modern day country music singers attempting to outdo each other in a jam-type scenario, while singing songs mentioned by Laura Ingalls Wilder in her Little House on the Prairie books. The renditions of the songs are certainly not how they sounded in the era of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Although I am a big fan of Ronnie Milsap and Randy Travis, they come across as pathetic has-beens, and I do not think Pa or Ma Ingalls would have approved of how the women are dressed. Additionally, there is too much biography on Laura and the Ingalls family, when the biography should have been about fiddles and fiddle players of that era and location.

The fiddle solos by Matt Combs are the only redeeming music in the production, and he did not even rate a listing as one of the stars on the front cover of the dust jacket.

Change the title to something better descriptive of the content, such as Laura Ingalls Wilders favorite songs.",1512172800,,1090,4.61340206185567

Wonderful job by all involved in this tribute to Pa and his fiddle!",1430611200,,265,5.162790697674419
8525434,2,B0085AXS7O,"Unfortunately the sound quality of this DVD is sunstandard, lacking fidelity and dynamics.
The sound on the performance we saw and recorded from the TV was much better, more fuller, more musical and truer.",1428278400,,205,5.0588235294117645
8525438,5,B0085AXS7O,"I thoughly  enjoy every bit of this.  The memories, the history  and especially the performers.
I especially liked Randy Travis but all of them were great.  Pa's fiddle is great to own.",1346803200,4,185,4.6875
