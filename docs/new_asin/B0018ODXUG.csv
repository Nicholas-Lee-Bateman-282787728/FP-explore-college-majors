3418015,1,B0018ODXUG,"This is just awful! This was a horrible movie full of inaccuracies, strange additions, nonsequential ocurrences, made up songs. There was nothing about this movie that was right. The actress was not great, the music was not Celine's. Just watching all of this transpire in English made it difficult to watch but everything was just so wrong. If you are a Celine fan and if you know ANYTHING about her please I beg you not to watch this movie. It was down right dreadful and a waste.",1219881600,2,482,4.551724137931035
3418016,2,B0018ODXUG,"Okay, I'm 15 and was raised for most of my life as a Celine fan. I've met Celine 5 times, Rene 3 times, her brother Michel once, and I've talked to Rene's son Patrick on the phone before. I've been to her show 13 times and know pretty much everything there is to know about this woman from the book she wrote herself and from her other bio-book, For Keeps. Everything in this movie was either false or done wrong. Celine didn't put nickels in her shoe until she was in her late teens and performed a concert in Japan. ""If You Asked Me To"" came out AFTER ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" and they didn't even get the hairstyles right. They just made it ""easy"" and gave her long brown hair most of the time. She went through many years with short hair and the outfits and Rene's marriage proposal wasn't even right! They were EATING dinner and it was before Titanic, for gosh sake. And her hair and dress and the stage isn't even right for ""A New Day."" Plus, her father wouldn't have been backstage because, Lord rest his soul, he already passed away by then! COMPLETELY WRONG. It would've been worth it to wait a couple years until she actually authorized a movie and then had them do it RIGHT.",1218067200,11,1191,4.297777777777778
3418017,5,B0018ODXUG,"I knew nothing about Celine Dion's life when I saw this movie on WE so I guess I don't know how I would feel if I had known the facts and realized the movie was inaccurate in places.

All I can say is that the movie is one of my favorites EVER and I am a huge movie fan.  It is a touching and tender love story,has terrific music in it and wonderful casting and acting. It's entertainment at its best. What more could I ask for?  I bought my own personal copy and I can't help watching it over and over.  Christine Ghawi has become a favorite actress of mine now.  I hope to see her in many more films to come.

Soooooo... if you want to see a great movie, watch this one.  If you want a detailed account of Celine's life with unrelenting accuracy, read her books and either skip this movie or hey, maybe watch the movie just for the fun and entertainment it might bring? I say give credit where credit is due...enjoy it for what IT IS and give the folks who made the movie a break.  It would be hard to believe that they have hurt Celine in any way.  Ever since I saw the movie, I can't stop listening to my Celine CD's!!!!!",1217289600,12,1125,4.0542986425339365
3418018,5,B0018ODXUG,"I like her music but I really know nothing of her life so has a story I thought this movie was really good.  I saw it on WE and then rented it and watched in two times in a row. I honestly was shocked at the reviews, I think it is a sweet inspiring movie.",1216944000,,255,3.6363636363636362
3418019,1,B0018ODXUG,"I am a huge Celine Dion fan, I've read everything about her life that I can, and even though I don't understand French I buy her French albums. So when I saw this movie on WE and the previews I was so excited to see this movie. Well, they completely ruined it. This movie was all wrong. It didn't seem like they did any research on her life for this movie. None of the women who played her at different ages looked anything like her. They completely ignored her French career, and they made it seem like she always knew English. They made Rene into a man who told Celine nothing about what was going on with her career. And the worst part to me was when Rene proposed to Celine in the movie in 1997 when he was trying to get her to do the song from Titanic. I mean they didn't even seem to know the basics about her life that she and Rene were married in 1994. These are all the same complaints as the first person stated but I just had to give my two cents. I yelled at the tv the whole time i was watching the movie. And another thing at the beginning of the movie when Celine gets hit by the car the little girl looks to be about five and I think that's the year they say it is. Well the truth is if you read Celine's book she says she was hit by a car when she was two. If you are going to make a movie about someone's life please do better research, if nothing else READ THEIR BOOK!! I mean come on. Overall this was the worst movie-biography about anyones life I'd ever seen. I would not recommended this movie to anyone unless they want to see it and yell at the t.v.
As a unauthorized movie I will enjoy it as a entertainment, but the accuracy is all wrong, so as a biopic of her life they missed the mark.",1211673600,3,1714,4.014619883040936
3418020,1,B0018ODXUG,"Any fan who says this is a must see movie must be trying to destroy Celine's career. The only reason why fans should see this movie is to trash it later on.

This movie gets EVERYTHING about Celine wrong. Simple things. They have Celine singing ""If You Asked Me To"" before she was signed with Sony. Before she ever came to the US. Before SHE KNEW ENGLISH!!! They have her NOT married to Rene when she's approached to sing ""My Heart Will Go On""!!!

And another thing, according to this film, Celine always knew English and she doesn't have a French accent. The makers of this film said something like ""Language doesn't matter. Celine transcends language."" Umm...NO! Celine's FRENCH language music is a HUGE part of her career and it's COMPLETELY ignored in this movie!

This movie is total trash. Celine should sue.

The woman who plays her can't sing worth beans either",1211241600,6,869,4.660130718954249
3418021,4,B0018ODXUG,"I just saw this movie on the WE Channel, and I have to say the movie was a MUST FOR FAN's, it was pretty cramped together for 90 minutes but it gives you a general idea about Celine's way to fame and stardom! I know Celine and Renee are in love, but it still a bit creepy to see their 'romance' portrayed the way it was in the movie!
Overall, Fan's will like the movie and enjoy ...",1210896000,4,382,3.91025641025641

3418025,4,B0018ODXUG,"I'm not a Celine fan. I don't have anything against her or her music, I just like other styles. But as a collector of biopics I felt a personal ""obligation"" to watch the movie and I came to it with little expectations, other than expecting a very ""cheesy"" production. But to my surprise, I found myself watching the whole movie without using the fast forward button. Grant it, there were a few cheesy scenes, like the Partridge Family/von Trapp sing-a-longs at the dinner table, but the plot moved along in spite of the otherwise distracting scenes. You can also tell the budget was somewhat limited. For example, many of the performance sequences featuring ""Celine"" often used the same stage, with the same backdrop, and the same band set-up. That aside, the acting was more than adequate for a production like this. I thought Christine Ghawi and Enrico Colantoni generated some real emotional tension as they portrayed the blossoming relationship between their characters. One thing I picked up on right away was the lack of ""Celine's"" accent. I was expecting more of her clipped English and hyper mannerisms, close to Ana Gasteyer's portrayal on Saturday Night Live. Jodelle Ferland did a good job portraying a young Celine.  I also understand that several facts were changed, but that's typical of most biopics. Of note, Celine's songs were not performed by Ghawi but by Trish O'Brien who did a very commendable job. Overall, for someone unfamiliar with Celine's story, I enjoyed the movie and learned more about Celine.",1465430400,,1524,4.976470588235294

3418031,4,B0018ODXUG,"Good acting. I would have liked if the actors would be a bit more resembling  the actual members of Celine's family. Her father was thin and short. The actor was big and tall.

3418051,5,B0018ODXUG,"Riveting life story of one of the most admired artists of our time, ""Celine"" recounts the discovery of her God-given talent, her struggle to become known as a child singer, and, ultimately, her rise to fame.  Equally interesting is the chapter in her life about the budding relationship and marriage to her husband-manager, when she was a very young woman.  Her dedication, indomitable spirit and passion for her art, make her an exceptional role model.

The story line is not good... The actors are good but is not close to Celine... It's just a weird movie.,1236124800,2,264,4.096153846153846
3418067,4,B0018ODXUG,"If there were any errors in the movie, I didn't notice them -- I was engrossed in the chemistry between the two important leads -- the actor who plays Rene Angelil and the actress who played adult Celine. They did a great job at portraying a beautiful, passionate love story. Many doubted the sincerity of Celine & Rene's relationship, and they have persevered because of the strength of their love for each other.

This movie begins with Celine Dion's childhood, the start of her singing in her family's pub ... and Michel Dion creating a demo and sending it to the then-manager of Genette Reno, Rene Angelil.  Rene listens to the demo and hears young Celine, then has her brought to his office.  After hearing her sing,  he agrees to represent her ... gambling on this young singer, and taking out a second mortgage on his house.  Celine was not a classically beautiful child (hey, Rene saw her in an awkward preteen phase!), with awkward teeth that forced the taunting nickname of ""Canine Dion.""  Young Celine flourishes as Rene mentors her into stardom.

Flash forward eight years.  Celine is 20 and a young woman.  Rene is divorced.  After Celine Dion wins 1988 Euro Vision, a kiss changes everything forever ....

The exact timeline of the songs didn't interest me, but the placement of various Celine Dion songs in the movie was very poignant.

The epilogue shows Celine with her brand new hairstyle (short, blonde) performing ""My Heart Will Go On"" while her parents watch from backstage, standing beside Celine's husband Rene Angelil with baby Rene-Charles in his arms.  A previous reviewer incorrectly said that Celine's father had already died before the ""A New Day"" tour, however it is said by both Celine and Rene on ""Live in Las Vegas"" - A New Day DVD that the show was going on already ... and Celine performed a show on the very day her father died, a hard show to do and very emotional.  This movie wasn't supposed to be the ""E True Hollywood Story"" or a ""Lifetime Intimate Portrait.""  Just a movie ""inspired by her life"" as it said at the end. And one that is very well done.",1235001600,13,2092,4.646739130434782
3418068,5,B0018ODXUG,Very heart warming and insperational story. Story was very well done. Celine is a very well thought of person and star. I hope the story did not stray far from what she knows of the details of her life.,1231286400,,202,4.205128205128205

3418071,3,B0018ODXUG,"I loved the two actress who played Celine Dion - Jodelle Ferland (young Celine) and Christine Ghawi (the older Celine).  Both actresses captured the essence and spirit of Celine Dion.  It is not their fault that the director and script writer did bad jobs pertaining to facts about Celine Dion and Rene Angelil's life.  Christine Ghawi is an excellent actress and her role was very believable.  I fault the director and writer for the movie's content.  It is obvious to any Celine Dion fan that the writer did not do any research about Celine's life.  If the writer had taken the time to read Celine's authorized biography the movie might have been more successful.

Celine Dion fans who watch this movie will become angry as soon as the moive's time lines become distorted.  I am uncertain why the director did negated the actual time line and facts.  I can only rationalize, that because Celine and Rene did not authorize the movie, the director took certain artistic liberties.

PS: To all Celine Dion fans -  Christine Ghawi did not sing in this movie, the singing was done by someone else, I forgot the singer's name but Christine only voice sync.",1221609600,7,1152,4.738693467336684
