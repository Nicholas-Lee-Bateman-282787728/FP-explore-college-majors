762455,1,6304025696,Do not I repeat do not waste your time watching this very bad and poorly put together film. Garbage would be given this movie too much credit.,1368489600,3,142,4.296296296296297
762456,1,6304025696,"I wounder where they got the money to make that movie.
I like almost any war move, but this one ...",1361836800,,99,3.761904761904762
762457,1,6304025696,Talk about a waste of time.  I could give only 10 minutes of my time. Do not waste your time,1360454400,,92,3.6
762458,1,6304025696,"Possibly the worst war movie ever made.  Kinski is the ONLY redeeming feature, but Klaus Kinski playing the 'sexy sadist' is hardly a stretch and thus can only debatably be called acting.  The movie is an Italian production, overdubbed into English, except the German dialogue, which is subtitled in Italian.  Can be confusing.  The plot takes 5 misfits to infiltrate an impregnable german fortress to find the dark and sinister Plan K.  To give you an idea of the scope of ludicrosity that plagues this movie, 'our boys' infiltrate this fortress by means of a trampoline that they have smuggled in.  The microfilm is hidden inside a fake wooden baseball, which then becomes a weapon in the only running gag in the movie.  There is NO character development, a sketchy attempt at plot.  The costuming is godawful, especially Kinski's dressing gown.  I would have dated the film to be mid-60s; I was surprised to find out it came out in 1985--that's how dated the clothes and hairstyles were!  I was IN italy in 1985 and people did not look that tacky!  The soundtrack is another abomination.
The film is short, too, only about 92 minutes.  You'd think they could have used that extra half hour to inject something like plot?  In a war film, even the cheesiest most jingoistic one, you feel SOME desire to side with our side.  It's bad when you're rooting for the Nazis, and that's how bad this movie is.
However, if you need a movie to make fun of, this is a great pick.  I laughed so hard (at parts where the movie was trying to be serious) that I scared my cats.",1087948800,14,1563,4.571942446043166
762459,2,6304025696,This entire production should have gone to *ell in my estimation. It does however contain the necessary ingredients for a great comedy -too bad they didn't approach it from that angle...Wake me up when it's over!!,1055894400,6,213,4.944444444444445
762460,4,6304025696,"It's a good action film whjch mixed war and western.
The plot is simple. In world war II, five American soldiers
attack the headquater of Nazi to get the secret paper.
But the action is fantastic. The film is mixed war & western
& some kind of martial arts.
Especially Nick Jordan's thumbling action seems a Chinese
Kung Fu star.",1011139200,2,329,4.5

762555,4,6304025696,"OK fellas, it's Sunday afternoon, you've honey-done all the honey-do's, and you have a couple of hours to relax before dinner with the in-laws. Do yourself a favor and watch this incredibly cheesy spaghetti WWII flick. You'll learn that what it takes to win a war is a trampoline and a lead-filled baseball. Klaus Kinski is perfect as a Nazi worm. Extremely goofy, and good fun. The final submachinegun battle is actually pretty well-filmed. Look, this isn't Kubrick, it's just good fun.",1445731200,,487,4.951219512195122
762556,2,6304025696,as a drama two stars is being generous. As a comedy I would give it four stars.,1441411200,,79,3.7058823529411766
762557,1,6304025696,"it sucked so bad, but I watched the whole thing.  I mean, it was really bad, all the way around.  No redeeming qualities.  Although, once I started watching, I couldn't stop.  Just watch it and see what I mean.",1440374400,,210,4.3076923076923075
762558,1,6304025696,Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Soldiers breaking into a tap dancing routine in their quarters?? I have heard of spaghetti westerns but spaghetti war movie?,1439856000,,173,4.8
762559,5,6304025696,"If Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around, this is a film that I would recommend to them for lampooning. The preposterous portrayal of American GI's as tap dancing devil may care soldiers that can throw a soft ball with the accuracy of a special forces sniper is hysterical. And the sound track...one of the most compelling parts of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns was the music. This film is the absolute opposite of that as the music that is supposed to contribute to the mood instead calls to mind clown cars and exploding cigars. If you like to watch movie to see just how bad they can be, I highly recommend this turkey.",1439596800,,639,4.614035087719298

762616,1,6304025696,Stopped it after 15 minutes.  Just could not get into it.,1416873600,,57,4.181818181818182
762617,1,6304025696,"Cornier than Kellogg's Corn Flakes is the only appellation that fits this turkey to a T.  Weirdness seems to be the norm ini this ting, and never did I see a film more deserving of thej prestigious Big Stink Award than this one!",1416528000,,228,4.3023255813953485

762620,1,6304025696,"It was almost painful to watch. The acting, special effects, and sound were horrible.

762661,1,6304025696,Did not care for it at all. It was simplistic and more like a spaghetti western then an actin war movie. Sorry just not very well done.,1407369600,,135,4.037037037037037

762703,2,6304025696,"Entertaining, cheesy WWII themed Italian movie with English.  Classic late 1960s Italian formula film, with heroes, villians, and beautiful woman (Margaret Lee in this case).  Film was also released in Italian, unfortunately the German translated subtitles were in Italian.",1391385600,,273,5.9743589743589745
762704,5,6304025696,Good movie. I have been searching for this particular movie for years after I first saw it back in the 1970s. Purchased it more out of nostalgia than anything else. I love it.,1390262400,,175,4.333333333333333
762705,1,6304025696,Bad quality.  War movie lover husband of mine wouldn't even watch this one due to bad quality.  Deleted it right away.,1389484800,,118,4.571428571428571

762707,5,6304025696,Loved it. Great work for the year and budget in which this film was produced. There sure are some haters out there.,1384387200,,115,4.2727272727272725
762708,3,6304025696,Without a doubt this was a Italian attempt to show their countrymen defeating the Germans who they detest serving now that they know the truth about the Nazi's.,1384041600,,160,4.75

762710,2,6304025696,I guess I am too attached to modern special effects. The acting was not great and I could not get into it from the beginning.  I just wasn't in the mood for this movie although I like war movies.,1375574400,2,195,4.0
762711,1,6304025696,We enjoy WWII movies. This one was less than a B movie. I was terrible. We could not finish watching it !,1374710400,4,105,3.8181818181818183
762712,2,6304025696,"This film should have been left in Italy. The only good part of the movie is the dubbing into English is quite good. The dialog being dubbed is horrible but done quite well. At least the Germans speak German unlike some war movies.

If you have an hour and a half to waste it is not the worst movie ever made. However, watch The Dirty Dozen instead.",1373241600,,349,4.208955223880597
