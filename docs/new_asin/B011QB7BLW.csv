8724924,5,B011QB7BLW,"If you like the music of Steve Hackett and want a wry insider's view, this is for you. Great music and revealing reflections on a long musical career from pre-Genesis years to his more recent fantastic music with Roger King and company. Watch as Steve demonstrates some of his guitar techniques, sitting on the couch at home. The video is not slickly produced, it is a bit amateuristic, but to me that works in its favor. It is at times like watching home movies. Steve's mother recalling stories from his childhood as Steve represses blushes with an amused face. Hear from his recent bandmates about their experiences working with Steve. The highlight of the whole thing for me is a hilarious bout of rapid British sarcasm between Steve and Roger King. I was rolling on the floor. It is generous as to length. The concert excerpts are great, with good sound quality. My one modest complaint is that I would have liked it if each and every solo album of Steve's could have been covered in more detail. Some are discussed at length, including Voyage of the Acolyte and Spectral Mornings. I would have liked hearing more details about albums like Darktown, Guitar Noir, Wild Orchids, etc., but not at the expense of the content that was included. So maybe an album-by-album accounting is an idea for a sequel. Don't miss the special feature, a conversation between Steve and the late, great Chris Squire, talking about how a series of collaborations on each other's projects led to the Squackett album.",1511049600,,1500,4.773076923076923

8724928,4,B011QB7BLW,"Probably giving four stars because I'm such a Hackett devotee. The documentary is interesting and entertaining largely because Steve comes across as open, generous and charming. That said, the production is quite amateurish, surprisingly so, often distractingly so. Scenes feel haphazardly arranged, album references feel random, and fans will be surprised at aspects of his life and career that are well known that are left out.  It's also odd that none of his Genesis bandmates had any screen time, though of course they may have been asked and declined. More live clips would have been welcome as well. That said, it's certainly enjoyable to spend two hours with Steve in a fairly intimate and extended context.",1454371200,4,714,5.155172413793103
8724929,4,B011QB7BLW,"If your a fan of Steve Hackett, you will want this. But.. the production and and editing seems a little unprofessional. Some very awkward camera work and no real complete info on his solo albums. Could use more dates, songs and stills to really tie the production together. Seems just kind of slapped together to answer the recent documentary about Genesis that failed to got into Hackett's career. That said, there are some great moments of Steve showing his guitar technique and a wonderful extra of Steve and Chris Squire chatting. Get it.",1450828800,4,542,4.838709677419355
