8675698,4,B00N1JQ1OG,"I like this movie mainly because I like Bernadette Peters, and she (and everyone else in the cast) did a fine job acting. I felt like maybe the creator just wanted to get something out about her childhood, and maybe was too close to the material to kill off some of her babies, as we say in writing. They did a good job capturing the tone of the bleak situation, but there were some things that could have been cut that really didn't move anything along (like the swimming pool scene) and some things needed to be explored a little more. What happened to the mom's performing career? When did it end? Why didn't dad try and get the kids? What's going on with that drug guy and why does that girl have to work for him to protect her mom, for those of us who aren't familiar with the world of drug dealers and poverty?
I did enjoy getting to see Bernadette Peters as a rather unsympathetic character, prone to scary tempers and rages, since she was relegated for so long to roles that traded mostly on her cuteness.",1419552000,3,1013,4.336842105263158
8675699,4,B00N1JQ1OG,"The movie was very well made for an indie movie. Bernadette Peters was really good. She did way better than I ever expected. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars out of 5 was because I really did not like the ending. It felt a little blunt and gave me the thought of ""really?!?!?"" But that could be my own opinion",1418601600,3,314,4.0
8675700,4,B00N1JQ1OG,I have to give this 4 stars because Bernadette Peters is such a talented thespian and actress I truly enjoy her and she played this nutty character well . The music scores are great and the story sad but poignant .,1418169600,2,214,4.2439024390243905
8675701,3,B00N1JQ1OG,"Film has become like most industries, all about making money, not producing a quality product.

If you can find a movie without a vampire or demonic spirit, or an alien invasion, you're lucky.
The movie studios make much more money on the overseas markets if they can rely on special effects, and ghosts.

Foreign audiences don't understand American culture, or customs, so the nuances in a good drama, or character study are lost on them.

And have you noticed the romantic comedies over the last few years, are really the same movie.  I don't mean they're similar, they are the same movie, that writers have been pressured to slap a new title on, and the studios put it into production.

Since movie executives jobs are based on previous money makers, they don't want to take chances on anything new, because if it flops, they are replaced in the blink of an eye.

""The Wedding Planner"" and ""27 Dresses"", are the same movie.  Jennifer Lopez falls in the street, wearing her hair in a bun, and wakes up to the face of the man she will marry staring down at her.  In 27.............Katherine Heigl, falls in the street on her back, with her hair in a bun, and wakes staring up at her future husbands face.  It is exactly the same scene.  And watch for Judy Greer.  She has been the assistant to the lead in so many movies, you don't expect to see anyone else.  The audience would think, ""Is Judy on vacation?""

So you have to look hard to find a good movie, and the ""Indie"" section can often be a place a little jewel can be found.

Unfortunately ""Coming Up Roses"" was not that for me.

When I saw Bernadette Peters was the lead, I was hopeful.  She is an extremely talented performer.

But she has done stage for so long, her acting didn't translate very well in this film.  They tried to use her background as a stage performer in musicals, to ad as much dimension to her character, and the film, as possible,  but nothing seemed to happen in this movie.

She was an unstable mother, unable to let go of her past success, had several minor breakdowns, and he daughter was more of the caretaker, but you really didn't get to know the characters very well, and it just seemed like a series of disjointed scenes strung together, that contained the elements of similar, but superior films like, ""Perfect Sisters"", but did not have the strong direction, writing or acting to carry it off.

I was at least hanging on to hope that it might turn out like ""Mermaids"", a great movie with Cher, and Winona Ryder.  But no, it did not, and I was left completely underwhelmed by this film.",1416096000,,2577,4.484978540772532
