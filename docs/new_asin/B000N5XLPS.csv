8175038,3,B000N5XLPS,"The Howdy Doody Show was a favorite of mine growing up.  The program ran five days a week until 1956 and then just Saturdays until 1960.  It had the distinction of being the first children's television program to air nationally.  Although this is a show over 60 years old now, it still has a place in many hearts.

It seems antique now, but still brings back good memories.  Buffalo Bob Smith puts a lot into his character and plays piano, sings songs, gives the kids prizes, promotes going to Sunday School, and then in later shows sells Wonder Bread and Hostess Cupcakes along with Howdy Doody and Clarabell the Clown.

This DVD has four shows and is 75 minutes long.  No dates are given but they are definitely in order of oldest to the latest one done.  The first show on the DVD has a very small set - and a small peanut gallery who is taught to trust the police and do what they say.  A drawing contest is featured and Buffalo Bob and a girl about 7 years old from the Peanut Gallery judge drawings of a policeman.  I was taken aback at the comments of how bad some drawings were - the kids were right there in the room!  But no one seemed to mind.  The best drawings got a prize.  A demonstration on how to obey Police was given with a stop and go sign.

The other shows were gradually better quality video as TV improved.  The first color show is announced (but the DVD shows it as black and white).  Howdy is shown thanking RCA for the technology and broadcasting in color.  The last show was more a Christmas special featuring Clarabell the Clown.

The show still entertains.",1220140800,6,1585,4.351535836177474
