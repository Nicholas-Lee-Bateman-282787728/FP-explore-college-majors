8515344,1,B007EQQ4LM,"This ""biography"" is a total waste of anyone's time and money. It's 30 minutes of some narrator telling things that you could read on her Wikipedia page just as well while showing the same video footage from YouTube (with no sound) in the background and the same pictures over and over again and completely unknown people, who don't even seem to know Chelsea's story well enough, commenting on and repeating what the narrator just said. They constantly try to remember how many books Chelsea has written, which one her first was and at what exact age she got her DUI (""in a BIG STATE PRISON""). I don't think that is a good start off to a biography that should be displaying facts. The only thing I like about this DVD is the cover. And the best thing is you can even just watch it online for free. Just google the title. I wouldn't recommend it, though because as mentioned it's a waste of time. I stopped watching after 6 minutes and switched to the biography of her from the bio channel which you can find on YouTube in three parts. If you're really looking for a legit biography of Chelsea Handler, that's the one you should go for. You're welcome.",1437696000,,1150,4.480952380952381

8515346,1,B007EQQ4LM,"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - this dvd is really pathetic , there is limited random  footage of handler , used over and over again , but with NO DIALOGUE OR SOUND, there is only a narrator giving commentary of handlers life , followed by an inexplicable group of unknown people discussing or reiterating their opinions of what the narrator just said ?? AND THAT IS ALL THIS MESS CONSISTS OF - it is labeled as ''unauthorised'' but it is total crap and really not worth the money or time wasted on this trivial , mindless nonsense .",1345420800,15,534,4.393939393939394
