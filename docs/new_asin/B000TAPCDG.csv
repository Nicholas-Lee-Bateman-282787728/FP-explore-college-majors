8208428,4,B000TAPCDG,"For me, the Snub Pollard shorts were the big draw, but I enjoyed watching them all. I was particularly surprised by Jimmy Aubrey delivering some solid laughs. This is the coda to the silent comedy era, and genuinely hope to see another volume of Weiss Brothers comedies. Film historian Richard M. Roberts provides commentary for many of these short subjects, providing another level of enjoyment.",1485475200,,396,5.107692307692307

8208430,5,B000TAPCDG,"This release is the most welcome of all releases of recent years. Extras on DVDs usually hold very little interest for me. I am usually interested only in sseing the films. However, this set includes some of the best commentary ever presented on  a DVD by one of the most knowledgeable people in the business. People have actually complained about the musical accompaniment on this set. The fact that these forgotten gems are even available is cause for celebration. Special thanks to Kit Parker Films, , Richard Roberts,  Phil Carli and David Drazin for making this the top video release of the last 20 years.  I eagerly await volume 2 of ""Weiss O Rama""  because I am sure it will be as good as this volume.",1349740800,,708,4.595238095238095
8208431,5,B000TAPCDG,"When you talk about silent comedy it's usually all about Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Arbuckle, they were, after all, the geniuses. But what about the working class comedian? The guy who just went in there and plugged away, being funny because that's just what he did for a living. That's what this collection is all about...SUPER, PRISTINE 35mm prints featuring working-man comics Ben Turpin, Snub Pollard, ""Poodles"" Hanneford, ""Hairbreadth"" Harry, Jimmy Aubrey and Izzie & Lizzie. Great treatment for the second tier comic, films that look better than the day they were released, giving us a rare, beautifully packaged example of silent film comedy from others than the ""masters"". After all you can only watch Chaplin's THE KID so many times without wondering just what else may be out there in the golden age of silent comedy. Well, this is it. Very funny stuff, a magic portal to the 1920's. And the outstanding condition of the prints is truly like stepping back into the past, it's even kind of spooky.
This is a great collection that you just have to see for yourself. Super highly recommended.",1335398400,3,1100,4.919354838709677
8208432,5,B000TAPCDG,"Silent comedy barely survives, and those few films that do still exist are an important part of our cinematic heritage.  These old comedies were indeed made for a production company that paled next to Sennett or Roach.  But the films collected here, in beautiful remastered prints from the original 35mm negatives, feature an abundance of clever ideas and hilarious moments from unfairly forgotten comedians such as Ben Turpin and Snub Pollard.  Some viewers may indeed be taken aback by the occasional ethnic stereotyping, but its inclusion does allow a historical perspective as to what was considered harmlessly funny during the first half of the 20th century.  In an era when political correctness has caused the old Tom and Jerry cartoons on DVD to be heavily edited, it is actually refreshing to find that this collection is warts-and-all, not santized, presented as they were originally released, and therefore maintaining their historical significance.  Ben Turpin, a top star with Sennett who invested wisely early in his career and only performed when he wanted to by this time, did some of his best work while ""slumming"" at  Weiss productions.  The Weiss-O-Rama collection features three of his funniest and least known films from this period.  Old time circus clown Poodles Hanniford has some of his classic routines captured on film here, while Snub Pollard teams with Marvin Lobeck as a small time verison of  Laurel and Hardy. No fancy camera angles, no messages, but a lot of truly inspired comedy moments from some wonderfully talented people.  Silent comedy is not defined only by the legendary masters like Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon, and Arbuckle.  There are several interesting and hilarious bypaths that offer a great deal of fun if one chooses to venture down any of them.  These Weiss-produced comedies are a good example, and I hope the fact that this set is labeled ""volume one"" means there are more to come.
As a PS, I should add that the musical accompaniment is terrific.  So often when silent films are put on DVD, the distributor slaps on some twenties jazz that serves as little more than a distraction.  This time, the music is played specifically for each film by two top musicians and the results are wonderful.",1193961600,19,2251,5.016129032258065
8208433,3,B000TAPCDG,"I love to discover something I know nothing about even if it doesn't always work out. I have never heard of the Weiss Brothers or their production company Artclass Pictures before now. Disc 1 of this 2 DVD set features well known silent comedians Ben Turpin and Snub Pollard at the end of their careers along with Poodles Hanneford of circus fame. I was totally unfamiliar with any of the people on Disc 2 (Hairbreadth Harry, Jimmy Aubrey, and Izzie and Lizzie).

The comics are fine but the material is second rate with ethnic stereotyping and bad taste in I&L that is absolutely jaw dropping. The one exception in this package are the Hairbreadth Harry shorts which poke fun at dated silent movie techniques. By the late 1920s when these were done silent comedy had become quite formulaic with crude slapstick mixed in with situation comedy. One can easily see the effect of Mack Sennett and Hal Roach on these shorts and they point the way to The 3 Stooges who are less than a decade away.

Many of the gags are recycled from previous films which was standard practice back then as no one ever thought that anyone would be watching these shorts over and over again thanks to modern technology. They would probably be amazed ala Buster Keaton that anybody else would care about them at all. It's a shame that all silent material can't look this good as these films come from relatively pristine 35mm sources which means that they were well preserved and probably not viewed very often. The overall look of the shorts is the strongest asset of this set along with the fine piano accompaniment of Phillip C. Carli and David B. Drazin.

WEISS-O-RAMA is definitely worth having if you're a fan of Pollard or Turpin or enjoy silent comedy in general but it's certainly not the ideal place to start. Thanks to VCI and Kit Parker Films for making this set available to give us some idea of what silent comedy could look like and how much it had changed by the time sound was ready to come in.",1190332800,14,1987,4.575842696629214
