1474795,4,B00005JLT5,"A picture is better than a thousand words. This saying is especially true for The Pianist, a film based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who escaped the fate of being put into concentration camp and survived in Warsaw by a fluke. That is not to downgrade or take anything away from the Mr. Szpilman's memoir that procreates a personal attachment to Szpilman. Director Roman Polanski commented, 'Until The Pianist, I have never read a piece so moving that I felt I had to bring it to the screen.'
On September 23, 1939, Szpilman played Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp Minor live on the radio as shells exploded outside in Warsaw. The bombing was so loud that he could not even hear his piano. It was the day that marked the last airing of Warsaw radio station. The city went starkly quiet as the Germans laid out boundaries of Jewish Ghetto and roamed through which to manhunt Jews to be hurled into concentration camps. Though he lost his entire family, Szpilman survived in hiding, in homes of his non-Jewish friends, in attics of empty apartments, in rubbles. A German officer who heard him play the same Chopin nocturne on a piano found among the rubble saved his life.
The Pianist achieves the same caliber of sobriety and grief though this filming does not take into the concentration camps. The scenes of Szpilman's parting from his own family is just as provocative as the horrible bloodshed images shown in many documentary films. Viewers immediately develop a personal and sentimental tie with Szpilman and feel his pain. The film, for the most part, delineates life in Warsaw during the occupation and the starkness of which lends it a verisimilitude that no other filming can afford. The quietude and the prolonged shots generate a sense of imminent danger, threat, and premonition. When is Szpilman going to be caught? What will he do when he runs out of food? Will shrapnel kill him? The mental threat is far greater than physical suffering. In the sense the film is powerful in what it doesn't do.
The film is almost 2 hours and 30 minutes long and yet none of the scenes are excessively long. The prolonged shots produce an ominous effect that is crucial in setting the mood of the film. Andrien Brody's performance is superb as if he himself went through the fugitive life. Brody really acts out the physical disintegration and emotional devastation of the protagonist. He has adroitly projected Szpilman's refusal to die and his endurance to live. The fact that Roman Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor makes the film a valuable piece of the Holocaust history and its studies. 4.5 stars.",1049673600,11,2614,4.798226164079822
1474796,5,B00005JLT5,"I have watched this movie only once so far but the images from the movie have really stuck with me.  Just when you think you've seen it all about The Holocaust, there's another, more horrible, story to shock and sicken people.

Roman Polanski, who won the Oscar for Best Director, took Ron Harwood's adaptation of the late Wladyslaw Spzilman's book of the same name and delivered stunning visual testimony to a black period in human history, throwing in some of what he saw as a boy in the Krakow ghetto.

There is no need to rehash the plot, as everyone is familiar with it.  Bottom line: Polanski and star Adrien Brody deserved their Oscars (and the movie should have received the Oscar for Best Picture).

Read the book, watch the movie, and you'll learn to appreciate things a little more than before.",1049155200,2,805,4.640845070422535

1475203,1,B00005JLT5,I didn't order this. It showed up in my orders on the Amazon app and I immediately tried to cancel it to no avail. It doesnt even work in the United States.,1520208000,,156,3.90625
1475204,5,B00005JLT5,"Excellent picture quality but Im doubtful about the 5.1 DTS audio quality (since this is an Import Region B Blu-ray, I play it on my region free Blu-ray player which has only one HDMI output which connects to TV so the audio to receiver comes through TV and not directly from the player which might be the reason why).

One flaw of this Blu-ray edition is that there are no subtitles. No subtitles or closed caption. If you are hard of hearing, you may want to skip this one and maybe wait for a US edition which might have subtitles. I am surprised that after all these years, there is still no US release Blu-ray edition of this movie.

I am not going to review the movie but will say that it is Romanski's masterpiece. It is a very moving film, a survival story about an artist who finds himself in a world that is literally falling apart. War atrocities are heartbreaking to watch. I think this film is far superior to Schindler's List which is probably more famous and commercially was more successful due to Spielberg's signature. I found the characters in Schindler's List too generic almost like caricature. This movie, on the other hand, made me feel like I was there seeing through the eyes of the Pianist. I am also impressed by Adrienne Brody's performance. When he won the best actor Oscar, I thought there were better performances and I wasn't particularly impressed by his acting. But now years later, my feeling have changed and I think he is amazing in this movie.

If you love war dramas, survival stories, you should definitely check this out (and make sure you have a region free Blu-ray player).",1519776000,,1616,4.58477508650519

I thought from the title it would be some boring movie about a guy who plays a piano, But its not boring in the least, its not just a guy playing a piano. I love movies about nazi germany, and this is a different take on a war movie. It shows the rapid decline of living conditions for jews in Poland and the terrible things that became of their new lives, or deaths, under nazi rule. Very well done era correct scenery and costumes.

1476138,4,B00005JLT5,"The film goes beyond its context in portraying a man thrown from the top of society into a hunted stranger upon the earth, witnessing that society reduced to his own subterranean level.  In many ways those familiar with the Holocaust genre have seen it before, bringing up the old crack ""there's no business like Shoah business.""  What saves ""The Pianist"" from being just another Holocaust exploitation movie is its basis on a real person - pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who thought himself more Polish than Jewish until contrary opinions were forced upon him by history.  Two aspects of the film - the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Polish Uprising of 1944 - have not been much depicted in American film.  Focusing on these rather than the ""standard"" death camp setting help make this production unique in the genre, certainly since ""Schindler's List.""

I must make a few criticisms that hold back my fifth star.  A frivolous one is that producers take such great pains to recreate time and place, as Roman Polanski has done here, down to the very clothes on his actors' backs: but they *always* neglect the mustaches favored by middle aged men of that generation.  Scan the faces closely and ne'er a lipwreath is seen. Much more seriously is the at-times above-board depiction of Nazi behavior: specifically in the ghetto round-up scene, where an old man in a wheelchair is rolled to a balcony and gratuitously dumped to his death; a man is run over laying in the street; and later a woman is shot through the forehead for asking a question.  ""They're Nazis - what do you expect?""  But in the Ghetto of 1940-41 the SS still took ""pains"" to appear ""professional"" - such pogrom atrocities were then reserved for the camps or the Eastern Front, out of public eye and image.  We also do not get a very clear understanding of Szpilman himself and his importance in Polish music.

Perhaps the most poignant scene of all is Szpilman emerging from his hiding place to walk down a familiar street, now an incognito pile of rubble and ruin.  This is the true face of war, so recognizable when perpetrated by Nazis but always excusable when done by one's own armed force.",1475712000,,2152,4.7399463806970505

I am fascinated by holocaust movies.  I have read the reviews for The Pianist and while some of them claimed that the movie was amazing.  I just didn't want to pay $3.99 to watch a movie when I can get several for free using my prime membership.  I finally broke down and rented this movie and I am so glad that I did.  It was an incredible story that accurately portrayed much of the horrors that the Jews went through during the holocaust.  You could feel the emotions of what they people went through and it showed you a man who was no different from other men but who lived through these atrocities.  My personal opinion is that this movie was far superior to Schindlers List.  That is one of my favorite movies but The Pianist tops it.  To be able to jump into the screen and feel as though you were living with this man, is powerful.  l will never understand what could possess people to so ruthlessly kill other human beings.

I think Adrien Brody was good with the character he HAD to play- but the movie was too long considering it was about his character hiding with the help of others. I wish he had joined the resistance. I wish he had done something other than look for food.
I cannot go to the Holocaust Museum because I break into tears.... BUT his performance left me cold. I wanted to love this movie, but I didn't and neither did my husband.
The times Jews were shot were horrific....esp. the woman who merely asked a question.

That is what ""The Pianist"" made me think about.  Watching this poor man pushed into situations that almost took his life - needlessly - and all because he was just jewish and Polish.  In this country, of course, it would be unconstitutional but that could be 'fixed'.  I know this is fictional and is just entertainment, but it impresses upon the freedoms we have here and the times that were then.  If we had such a leader that was like Hitler, this

My biggest beef : whose hands were used in this movie at the piano?
Some people have flat feet; this person had flat fingers; slapping and flapping up and down the keyboard like little fish.

1477154,4,B00005JLT5,"Released in 2002, The Pianist is Roman Polanskis account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion. Szpilman is separated from his family members when they're carted off to be slaughtered and does whatever he must to survive until the Allies defeat Germany. Hes dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.

Like 1993s Schindlers List, The Pianist is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. In any case, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour youll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony blockbusters.

Some have complained that Szpilmans a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: Thats why it's called ""The Pianist"" and not ""The Warrior Jew"" or ""Rambo 5: Kraut Killer."" He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but thats not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. Whats he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun wouldve been foolish and suicidal. Szpilmans a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); hes the hero of the story.

The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. Schindlers List shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas The Pianist shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while The Pianist is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.

The movie runs 2 hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany.

1477200,5,B00005JLT5,"THE PIANIST is the movie that made Adrien Brody the youngest-ever Best Actor Oscar winner, but it was hardly the first movie about the Holocaust.  Where it differs from movies like SCHINDLER'S LIST is in its particular focus:  not so much ""the Holocaust"" as the Warsaw ghetto and one man, young Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody), successfully eluding the Nazis thanks to the kindness of an unwilling Nazi, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), and then establishing himself as a successful concert artist.  THE PIANIST is based upon Szpilman's memoirs of the same name.

As Szpilman's family is sent off to a death camp a third of the way through THE PIANIST and never appears again, it would be tempting to call the film ""Adrien Brody's show all the way.""  But in fact the film's first distinction lies in its painstaking period detail:  everything looks right out of 1940's Continental Europe, from the costumes, to the narrow side-streets, to the house interiors -- to the truly spectacular set depicting a bombed-out Warsaw just before its liberation by the Russians.  Yet nothing is romanticized:  the filth of the ghetto is just as credible as is the exterior of a genteel cafe that excludes Jews.  The actors playing the Szpilmans were all cleverly chosen to form a believable-looking family, with Brody and Jessica Kate Meyer as his sister Halina resembling their mother (Maureen Lipman) and the other siblings, Regina and Henryk (Julia Rayner and Ed Stoppard), resembling their father (Frank Finlay).  A last, gratifying detail is the fact that Brody plays most of his piano solos (the majority of them by the great Polish composer Chopin) himself.  In a film about a pianist, it would have lessened the impact had the solos been entrusted to a double.  (I believe the only time a double -- Polish pianist Janusz Olejinezak -- is used is for an intricate passage during the film's closing credits.  All you see, however, are his hands.)

Against this superb backdrop it is, in fact, Brody's performance that carries the film.  Director Roman Polanski could hardly have found an actor with more strikingly dark looks, or one who wore the period costumes better -- or one who could be so riveting while actually saying very little.  As a character who spends so much of his time quiet and alone, Brody's expressive face, with its famously prominent nose and big, sad green eyes, is exactly what was needed.  Take, for instance, the moment in the film when Szpilman noisily drops some crockery in an apartment where he is hiding.  In the seconds following the accident, a range of emotions -- from shock and dismay to acceptance and even mild amusement -- flit subtly across Brody's features.  Watch the way he struggles to dissemble as the deportation train leaves the ghetto with his family aboard, or the way he looks both exhausted and cold to the point of numbness as he sinks into a waiting chair in a safe house.  Whatever the emotion or mood, Brody finds the proper expression, vocal or (most often) physical, for it.

Several touching moments (most of them from Brody) aside, THE PIANIST lacks the sentiment (not to be confused with sentimentality) of some other Holocaust dramatizations.  In place of warmth, it generally offers a terse look at events of the period, emphasizing the randomness and senselessness of them.  This probably should not be called a drawback; but two drawbacks I believe the movie does have are that a few of its ""bit"" actors are hammy and that its final ""running from the Nazis"" sequence (which ends with Szpilman meeting Hosenfeld) goes on a bit too long, exciting as it is (I invariably jump at several moments).  These drawbacks are not serious, of course, and should not deter you from checking out this great movie.  You will be on the edge of your seat as I was, I promise you that!",1443312000,9,3846,4.852986217457887

1477762,5,B00005JLT5,"Incredible movie about how the Jewish people were treated under Hitler. Most movies show concentration camps, but this reminds us there were also labor camps and people who had to hide, not knowing what was going on from day to day. Adrien Brody is great... his eyes are so expressive... there is never any doubt about how he is feeling. I wish the end had told us what happened to Wadysaw Szpilman's family, but maybe no specifics are known.",1425081600,,442,4.6075949367088604

1477807,4,B00005JLT5,"THINGS I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE:

* realism
* based on Szpilman's memoirs
* good acting
* very good cinematography
* realistic surroundings/props
* told the story well
* seemed to accurately depict what life was like for Szpilman and those he knew during that time

OTHER NOTES:

The violence represented what happened; it is well spaced throughout the movie (i.e., this movie is not non-stop violence).  I didn't notice the strong language, so it must have been brief and/or fitting for the scene.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't move me like other WWII movies I've seen.  The main character's reaction to the horrible events he experiences is mostly observation; he sees what happens, but he doesn't give the impression that it impacted him.  I remember seeing tears in his eyes once...maybe twice.

It's well worth watching, and I look forward to watching it again.

1477861,5,B00005JLT5,"This film was a towering achievement in cinematic presentation of a period in history.  The subject was the Holocaust, i.e. the German occupation of Poland and the resulting war crimes against Poles including most of the Jews of the region.
The film was directed by Roman Polanski, who won the Academy Award for it.  It also won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.
This Euro production used the story about a concert pianist in Warsaw who somehow managed to survive the Holocaust via luck and pluck.  We use him as a 3rd person camera; he stoicly observes all of the events while hiding or searching for enough to keep him going.
The film asks that you immerse yourself in that world(1939-46) and experience what he did.  It's breathtaking and disturbing and you have to ask yourself if you want to commit to seeing it.  However, if you want to see what happened under the Nazi occupation, this is the only vehicle to see it.
Schindler's List(in contrast) was a great film which happened to cover the same subject but was not nearly the same achievement.  Where Schindler's List gave an inkling of the unpleasantness of the epoch, The Pianist showed in detail.  The difference is stark...
The highlight of the film is the ending where a German of moral center briefly aids our hero.  It was very important to show, even in this theatre of war, that not all men were of the same nature.",1423526400,,1405,4.637096774193548

1477866,5,B00005JLT5,"This gripping Holocaust saga is outstanding from start to finish with great writing, smart directorial choices, and an Oscar-winning turn by Adrien Brody as pianist Wladislaw Szpilman. It is based on Szpilman's memoir of survival in the midst of the Nazi extermination of Poland's Jews. It is both a tear-inducing tale of horror and death and a hair-raising adventure story about clinging to life. I like most of all that this is a Holocaust movie that actually focuses on Jews (are you listening Steven Spielberg?). In one of the extras on this DVD, director Roman Polanski talks about his own lucky escape from the Nazis while the rest of his family perished. It's clear that his own memories enhance many of the details of the film.

The writing is efficient and powerful. The very first scene shows Szpilman playing piano in a radio studio as German bombs fall in September 1939. The next 10 minutes take us through the next two years and the increasing restrictions imposed on the Jews, ultimately leading to their slave labor and transportation to death camps. It propels you into the heart of the story. The pace is riveting, and I found myself rooting for Szpilman all the way.

As played by Brody, Szpilman is a charming, lovable guy whose brilliance as a pianist inspires others to help him escape death. The horrors he witnesses as his family and community are destroyed are vividly portrayed in scenes where people are forced to bargain for life and face casual cruelties. As Szpilman avoids ""deportation"" and hides out in Warsaw, he witnesses the Warsaw ghetto uprising by Jews (1943) and the general Polish uprising (1944). I really appreciated how these stories of resistance were included. Szpilman is also aided along the way by Christian Poles and a German captain with a love of music. His encounter with the ""good"" German offers a little uplift at the end of this very dark story. The musical score, including several gorgeous Chopin pieces, complements and enhances the story. Highly recommended.",1421712000,11,2017,4.929411764705883

Secondly, my wife and I have always liked classical music and to be able to see his hands move on the piano keyboard was really a treat. Thirdly, the fact that the nation of Israel is still standing is a miracle and God in the Bible told Abraham, ""I will bless them that bless you and curse them that curse you and in you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed"", of course referring the Lord Jesus Christ, who in His humanity was born of the tribe of Judah.  God promised to David a king and a throne forever.  Israel will be a cup of trembling before the Lord returns to set His kingdom to rule the whole world from Jerusalem.  He who touches Israel touches the apple of God's eye, not that God has eyes as humans do but it expresses the real importance of Israel in the plan and purposes of God.  As we would defend our eyes from anything coming towards it so God will defend His people.

Over 12 Million humans went to there graves because of many misguided & gullible people that decided to follow the will of a mad man (hitler)! He was a vicious racist sociopath who ultimately tortured and destroyed millions of human beings! Another movie,12 Years a Slave gives us a real understanding of the horrors that the Africans endured in America during slavery! And frankly though the game has changed,it really just remains the same as ever!

1478596,5,B00005JLT5,"I had not seen The Pianist in a few years at the very least. I never even opened the DVD I bought at the time of its release as it played on cable often enough not to have to.

 I decided to watch the film again and wanted to it was time to open the DVD. I own the first release of the film which is a flipper disc, but it is only because the film is on one side and the bonus material is on the other. The DVD transfer is excellent and looks almost HD, so much so I thought I was watching a Blu ray disc instead of a standard DVD with up scaling.

The film hasn't lost its edge and captures a truly horrific time in history very realisticly, but it also counters that with the triumph of the human spirit.

I've always been fascinated with this time period and have seen many films on the subject. The Pianist is very unique in terms of the way it is handled. We see these horrible events through the eyes of one person. Adrian Brody who does a great job with his character as he is alone in so many scenes, it takes a lot to get that right and not feel the need to do too much physically.

Even at two and half hours long this film captivates the viewer from start to finish. Roman Polanski deserves much of the credit drawing from his own life's experiences for the events portrayed in this film. The sets, locations and camera work are also outstanding. It's an amazing film on every level.

I haven;t heard many good reports on the Blu Ray so if you're interested in the film the DVD looks really good, but I'm not sure if the newer singled sided release has the bonus material the original one has?",1394236800,2,1604,4.108626198083067

1478600,5,B00005JLT5,"I am not a reviewer. I do not use fancy words, analogies and above-most-people's head of saying what I believe a movie is about. I am telling this as an average movie watcher. I have a soft heart.

The insidiousness of the persecution of the Jews is accurately portrayed in this award-winning film. I admit to having a fascination with World War 2 as my grandparents (German) fled this piece of history as it was happening -- they were sickened by what was going on and knew they needed to get out of there.

None of the tragedy of the Jew's persecution happened quickly. It started as far back as 1939 -- America didn't know of any of it. It was a secret. Things happened a little at a time -- this is how horrible things become common place and an uprising has no chance of taking place.

The little steps, one at a time, leave the Jewish population with the mindset that one more step to 'follow the government' rules is not that big of a deal -- shocking, yes, but the piece meal way it goes is tolerable. By the time it is intolerable, the chance for an uproar and resistance is long gone.

This is a bit of a tear jerker and it is sobering and might make you feel uncomfortable at times. But it is factual.  Watch it and know that this should never happen again. Be mindful that Americans are slowly losing their own rights.... and this is how it happens. Have you noticed it yet? Bet you haven't. Open up those peepers, people.

A couple minor spoilers -- so stop here if you don't want to read them.

This story, about a gentle Jewish pianist, is painful to watch. He is both lucky and unlucky in how how he ultimately survives while watching his entire family be exterminated. He must watch as his family is herded into railroad cars -- shoved into the carriers of the concentration camps. He is spared by a last minute intervention to walk alone, hiding, and ultimately almost starves to death as he must count on others to look out for him.

The beautiful finale of the Pianist pounding out a gentle, turbulent, furious, hopeful selection of music (on the piano, of course) conveys what he went through in a profound way. His hands, sore, cold and weak from malnutrition barely function at first. But his talent and passion overcomes the physical and he plays his sorrow and desperation for a very unique audience.

Watch if you haven't. It's great.",1394064000,7,2360,4.4570765661252905

1478669,4,B00005JLT5,"I am not a fan of Holocaust representations very selfishly because I can't handle the unresolved injustice.  It doesn't make me feel better in a misery loves company way - it makes me extremely uneasy because also the films cannot possibly do the Holocaust justice and that means we are not being smartened up enough to see the whole truth and we are walking around with blurred vision with only a faint sense of the ongoing existence of danger.

But second time around, few years after the first bored perusal, after reading Piepel, I think that the most important thing about this film is Thomas Kretschmer's character who must have been an operative tasked with infiltrating and befriending the local Poles not only as a backup plan to remain in place in the event of the failed takeover attempt of waging WW2 but also as current information gathering and corruption of ire at the invading Germans.

""He and several fellow German Army officers felt sympathy for all peoples of occupied Poland. Ashamed of what some of their countrymen were doing, they offered help to those they could whenever possible.
Hosenfeld befriended numerous Poles and even made an effort to learn their language. He also attended Holy Mass (Latin rite), received Holy Communion, and went to confession in Polish churches, even though this was forbidden by official Nazi decree. His actions on behalf of Poles began as early as autumn 1939, when he allowed, against regulations, Polish POWs access to their families and even pushed (successfully) for the early release of at least one.[2] During his time in Warsaw, he used his position to give refuge to people, regardless of their background (he gave refuge to at least one politically persecuted anti-Nazi ethnic German as well), who were in danger of persecutioneven arrest by the Gestapo, sometimes by getting them the requisite papers and jobs at the sports stadium that was under his oversight.["" - wikipedia entry for Wilm Hosenfeld.",1392508800,2,1969,4.9787234042553195

He never forgets his music and lives to carry on sharing this beauty with others caught in this horrible reality. The scene where he is rescued by a Nazi officer is excellent. The officer lets him play the piano and the music is full of passion and pain and hope. It is a bitter sweet scene. This movie is a classic. The acting is superb. The directing is wonderful.

1478723,5,B00005JLT5,"01-23-14  Beside being a Classical Music collector and a movie fan, I thought this film was one of tyhe best movies I have EVER seen.  Stories about WWII or WWI with much truth to them are hard to find and toughh to beat.  This one is both. I have at least a couple of arguements why this is such a good work.  A good arguement is the ""Look "" of the film.  The shading of the colors in the filming lends an aged look ands  even a sort of newsreel appearance.  Out of doors location shots are authentic aND DETailed.  The plot of the story gets going quickly without much set up time wasted, as we learn about the characters during the drama.  Not every single fact in the movie is 100% accurate, nobody can be can be, but the producers went out of their way to be as honest as they could be.  Yes, there really were a lot of non-Jews who came to the aid of the Jewish Poles being persecuted.  Thomas Kretschmann's character, the Capt. Hosenfeld, really did exist and helped as many jews as he could.  It took Israel a long time, but they finally honored him a one of the""Righteous of the World"" an honor given to non-Jews who assist Jewish people in distress, as is the case of Oskar Schindler, of ""Schindler's List"".  I don't know what religion Hosenfeld was, but he attended the Latin Mass, took Holy Communion and went to Confession regularly.  He died in Soviet captivity from an aortic aneurysm, perhaps inflicted by Nazi beatings and other torture.  I believe he may, very well, be in  Heaven,  perhaps as a martyr.  Since the predominant faith in Poland is Catholicism, the chances that most of the non-Jews who aided people like Szpillman, were in fact Catholics.  They were also hunted down and murdered by the Nazi's and for any haters of the Catholic Church out there, let it be understood that Pope Pius XII issued over 20,000 fake Baptismal certificates for Jewish refugees flee ing the Nazi's both in Italy and other countries, notably Poland, with even more Catholics as residents than in Italy.  He also provided safe travel to some  South American countries to escape persecution and executions.  Polanski could of skimmed over the Hosenfeld character, but he didn't.
  Perhaps the best reason this is such a fine drama is this.  Brody plays a man who, as a professional pianist live sin the world of music and art.  He does not concern himself with petty feuds, squabbling or material entities.  He is, to be honest a bit of an unrealistic dreamer. His world is a bit of a fantasy place, yes, but it provides him a foine living.  Nonetheless, it is a place of beauty, innocence, delicacy and truth.  Creativity trumps destruction always and love, in every form, is all around.  People in the arts generally are polite, kind , passionate, honest hard working and charitable.  They simply want to play music, paint, write, sculpt or even just think, without being tortured, beaten, murdered, lied to, cheated or evicted.  It is very hard for any man or woman to suddenly change their entire view of life from one of elegance to that of brutal and barbarous behavior.  Just try to imagine the things that Szpillmann endured happening to you, and for a while at least, no one there to help.  Happily for him, there were people who cared, and these were, with only a few acceptions, total strangers.  I believe I might act in the very same way as did his character, run for my life, hide in a sewer if needed, or in a latrine, as in ""Schindler's List.""  I shudder to think what I might do to survive another day, or hour or minute.  This is a thought provoking and serious movie and I see it about once a year or more, evey 18 months, maybe, it's that hard to watch, but it is excellent!!!

1478781,5,B00005JLT5,"This is by far my favorite film of the new millennium, and I have seen it many times. It is a faithful rendering of painist Wladyslaw's Szpilman's own simple and moving account of the terrible events he suffered in occupied Poland. Great for its performances, sets, script and costuming--but it's the carefully nuanced details that elevate this production- and they could only be brought to life by someone who lived through that era and knew that part of the world.

Witness Wladek paying the piano in a restaurant and flirting so delightfully with a lady patron, Wladek strolling with a charming young cellist, who so sweetly and innocently says. 'Oh Mr Szpilman, you really are quite wonderful.' That is an era that is gone, swept away by that brutal war, never to return.

There are, of course, many scenes which stand out during the film, but I think the young woman who is shot and falls to her knees on the street during the Warsaw Uprising, the 'crazy' old man and his orphans, the child who is beaten to death trying to crawl back under the wall into the ghetto, the young woman who has asphyxiated her child, the German soldiers who eat sandwiches while burning bodies, the gold tooth on the crook who is supposed to take care of Wladek but uses the opportunity to enrich himself, are outstanding.

Brody's performance is amazing, but so is that of Kretschmann as the German officer who helps him- a mix of superior charm, cynicism, and benign indifference--one often saw that in European intellectuals of the era--but it is a character type that is sadly lost to history as well.

The final scenes of the devastation of Warsaw are incredible and powerfully moving, as is the Chopin Polonaise that Szpilman is required to play after a long and devastating period of isolation.  A beautiful film and the fulfillment of the incredible promise that Polanski first showed in my favorite film, Chinatown.",1383868800,4,1909,4.7902735562310035
1478829,5,B00005JLT5,"This review contains spoilers:

The memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman form the basis of this brilliantly portrayed story, as a gifted pianist defies life and death odds in Nazi occupied Poland.

The Pianist illustrates the depravity of supporting a death culture, as the consequences of it's evil means rapidly close in on Polish Jews living in proximity to the Warsaw ghetto.  As freedom is increasingly restricted by the Nazi invasion, the Szpilman family adjusts to each upheaval until they're faced with a threat to their existence.

Throughout the horrifying ordeal, Szpilman's gift of music brings beauty and tranquility to his surroundings, whether expressed before an appreciative audience or within his own soul.  This inner solace is a refuge from the outward circumstances, exposing the futility of restricting human freedom, and the insatiable appetite for control.  As Szpilman's fight for survival is juxtaposed against the determination to murder, the opposing forces come face to face.

Adrien Brody's performance is amazing.",1383782400,3,1037,5.525316455696203
1478830,5,B00005JLT5,"I first saw ""The Pianist"" when it came out in the movie theaters more than a decade ago. It remains one of the top films that I have seen, and is certainly one of the best Holocaust films of all times for a variety of reasons.

First of all, the acting itself is suburb. Adrien Brody does a superb job of portraying Wladyslaw Szpilman, an acclaimed Jewish pianist, who is separated from his family (most of whom are sent to the concentration camps and eventually death) and who somehow survives by hiding in an abandoned building. Near starvation, he is discovered by a Nazi officer who befriends him and provides him with food until the near the end of the war.

Second, the storyline is compelling. Although one cannot view the movie without becoming both depressed and distressed at the inhuman cruelty inflicted on the Jews during the Holocaust, one is encouraged by the indomitable human spirit displayed by Szpilman, as well as by the Nazi officer who, despite his status, has enough human decency left to befriend him.

Third, although the movie contains violence (a film that must deal with the Holocaust cannot avoid showing violence without ceasing to be realistic), the violence is not gratuitous. Although there are some scenes that are difficult to watch, the violence is not so prominent or overwhelming as to detract from the story itself.

Finally, at no point does the movie drag. I found my attention totally riveted on the screen for the entire two and a half hours.",1383004800,4,1485,4.766536964980545

1478899,5,B00005JLT5,"In one of the most-needed ""comebacks"" probably in movie History, the director-""Auteur"" Roman Polanski shows off why he is the scion of this much-deserved title. Movie-goers may remember him from his days as the Ultra-literal Interpreationalist of such films as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Tess of the D'Ubervilles,"" etc, but in this epic he really does show off his force. It sucks you in and is compelling, from the very fist shot, as the Warsaw family ""Celebrates,"" thinking they've evaded a German offensive (huddled around news-feed pirated in through BBC radio.) But, alas, the Bombs and machine-gun fire come in the next scene. Based on the Auto-Biography of a ""Piano Player"" in Warsaw, Poland (whom Brody portrays w/Oscar-Winning tour-de-force), this Masterpiece displays all the horror and cruelty of man's mismanagement of man w/detail and tear-jerking effect. We are swayed, and bought to disbelief, as the ""Piano Player""'s family is carted off to Treblinka (so much for a UK ""Reconnaissance!!!"") No-where in this film is there any semblance of ""Affect,"" or anything, at all, of it somehow trying to be any kind of an ""Art-House"" -movie. At not one single moment are we ""bored,"" or left not rooting for the poor protagonist. In Polanski's homage to his own time consigned to the Jewish Ghettos, we cannot be diswayed from what the Central Theme of this film really is:  That, yes, man actually is capable of these kinds of things . . . and, that, yes, there is Salvation in the Forever-Documenting of them, for the future . . .",1376697600,3,1529,4.97265625

This movie caused me tons of sorrow and I also felt compelled to read part of the real diary from the man himself, Mr. Szpilman. There's just so much anyone can learn from a movie like this. What it means to be separated from your family knowing that they are all going to be killed. What it means to live in the direst of condition for the rest of your days. What it means to be humiliated by these monstrously insensitive individuals called 'Nazi'.

There's nothing that anyone can write to express all these ideas. This is a movie that all grown ups should see, to grow up more. Stop watching Marvel movies, stop watching movies to entertain yourself, and watch this movie to learn something. I learned to try, everytime I am angry or sad about something that has to do with my own disappointments, to remember what it must have meant to be one of the victims of Nazism. Go to wikipedia and read the article about Czes'awa Kwoka and you too will learn to tend to complain a lot less.

Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) is a twenty-seven year old accomplished pianist living in Warsaw with his family when Poland is attacked by Germany in 1939. The occupiers quickly introduce harsh regulations for the Jewish population eventually leading to their forced resettlement into the sealed ghetto district. Wladyslaw and the Szpilman family are forced to deal with the horrific realities of living in the ghetto. In the summer of 1942, most of the ghetto inhabitants including the Szpilmans are loaded onto trains headed for the Treblinka extermination camp, however Wladyslaw is saved by a sympathetic Jewish policeman. He is sheltered by several Poles until the Germans level Warsaw following the 1944 Uprising. Szpilman hides in the ruins where he is discovered by a German officer who surprisingly assists the starving fugitive. The Red Army ""liberates"" Warsaw in January 1945 and survivor Szpilman is once again able to perform for audiences.

This is a superb film. The true story of Szpilman's survival in the midst of the world coming down around him is gut wrenching and compelling. Brody's performance is a tour de force. Beautiful Emily Fox gives an extremely sweet performance as Dorota. Don't blink or you'll miss several cameos from some very notable Polish actresses: Joanna Brodzik is the ""woman shot in the head,"" Maja Ostaszewska is the ""woman with child,"" and sassy Katarzyna Figura plays Szpilman's anti-Semitic Polish neighbor.

Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself, reveals in the bonus special feature, A Story of Survival, that several of his own personal memories of the Holocaust are included in the film. Are human beings really capable of such horror? Some parts of the film may be controversial for general viewers including scenes showing some Jews profiting from the ghetto, the Jewish Police collaborating with the Nazis, and anti-Semitic Poles but credit Polanski for not shying away from historical accuracy. The score, which includes several songs by Chopin, is marvelous. The Pianist is a Polish-French-German-British co-production and was filmed mainly in Warsaw.

Although there were no references to it in the film, pianist Szpilman often accompanied singer Vera Gran in ghetto cabarets. He later accused Gran of collaborating with the Nazis. Szpilman's son tried to legally block the publication of Gran's biography, Vera Gran: The Accused (2012), which includes her counter-accusation that Szpilman participated in the deportation of Jews to Treblinka as a member of the Jewish Police.

It may interest viewers of this film to know that anti-Semitism is unfortunately still very popular in Poland where it has deep roots. As just one example, a recent book by Polish historian Ewa Kurek, ""Polish-Jewish Relations 1939-1945: Beyond the Limits of Solidarity"" (2006), claims Polish Jews welcomed the Nazis and the forced resettling into sealed urban ghettos as an opportunity to create their own ""autonomous provinces"" separate from the Catholic Poles. She states that Jews were the ones who financed and built the walls around the ghettos to keep the hated Poles out. According to Kurek, Jews initially celebrated their cozy life in the ghettos safe behind their walls while the Polish Catholic intelligentsia was largely wiped out by the Nazis without a single helping hand from the satisfied, ghetto-dwelling Jew. It was only in 1942, writes Kurek, when the Germans began transporting the ghetto population to death camps, that the Jews realized they had been duped by their Nazi friends. Yes, this popular book is the kind of anti-Semitic filth that is still resonates with many Poles.",1364688000,2,3889,5.348039215686274

The Pianist has a familiar story, but that doesn't affect its impact whatsoever. The struggle of Wadysaw Szpilman, his family, and his peers hits hard and consistently. Throughout the story, over the years, we see the degradation of the Jewish people, and their constant push for survival. Although the main storyline is powerful, the smaller details and scenes had a large impact, as well: Nazis driving over the recently executed, some that are still alive; a young boy begging his pale, dead father to wake up on the street; small children begging for food and money with an authentic look of worry and sickness on their faces; the elderly stealing food from each other, only to desperately eat it off the dirty street floor. These scenes, plus the Nazi's atrocious actions throughout, may infuriate you, or, at least, make you shake your head. Adrien Brody is magnificent, his character's transformation throughout the film is stunning to watch. The music is excellent. The cinematography is superb, as well.

Overall, The Pianist is a powerful and captivating film, with amazing performances, beautiful music, and great cinematography. It's a difficult film to watch, but an experience worth having. As of 3/10/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is HIGHLY recommended.

Of all the War films depicting the cruelty of German enforced rule, this is certainly one of the best.  It depicts one man's heroic struggle to survive the deadly oppression that was Nazi Germany.  Adrien Brody stars as an acclaimed Jewish pianist (Wladyslaw Szpilman) living in Warsaw, when Hitler's war machine crushes Poland.  Forced into a ghetto and systematically humiliated, starved, and brutally oppressed, he must somehow find the means to survive the brutal oppression of the Nazi occupation.  His journey is a appalling one, filled with endless hurdles that threaten his survival, yet, a journey that will grip the viewer until the very end.

If you watch only one film on the oppressive regime of Nazi Germany, this is the one to watch.  Not recommend for children under the age of 13.  Parental discretion advised due to intense violence.

1479211,5,B00005JLT5,"`The Pianist' is one of those films that stays with you long over you've watched it.  In fact, I haven't seen the film for roughly eight years or so and yet I still remember it remarkably well.  The triumph of the human spirit and the will to survive is rarely portrayed with such earnestness and raw honesty.  In fact, there is so much heft to this film that it is almost hard to take in at times.

It's heavy, that's for sure.

Telling the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, `The Pianist' recounts the horrors of the Holocaust with riveting action.  This true story centers on Szpilman's escape from captivity and his journey of survival and he is forced into hiding.  As he moves from one are to the next, we see those who aided in his survival by putting him up, bringing him supplies and food and yes, even those who left him to die on his own.  Some balk at the fact that Szpiman's story isn't of much importance; that he didn't accomplish anything remarkable or that this one man's story isn't impactful enough, but to them I balk at their reasoning.  This singular tale is really a universal story of triumph in the face of adversity and shows that dwelling in each and every one of us is the power and strength of overcome and prevail regardless of the perils in front of us.

Beautifully acted and directed, both Brody and Polanski earned those Oscars.  Brody is phenomenal as the tortured Szpilman.  He ages remarkably with the time, allowing the true nature of his situation to impact his every being as the film progresses.  Polanski uses the right amount of restraint, reigning in so as not to allow his film to become a saccharine mess, which it so easily could have been reduced to.  Instead, `The Pianist' becomes something so much more.  It has heart and soul but it maintains a grit that allows it to speak volumes with an honest interpretation of one of the most heartless times in human history.",1353283200,,1910,4.5276967930029155

1479218,5,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist (Roman Polaski, 2002, 148')

Having read and heard from my usual sources about it, this is the first time I have actually seen The Pianist. In a way, I have earlier avoided seeing it - as a long time historian, I know the history of World War II down to more details than I occasionally care to remember. I also know Poland, have been to Auschwitz in 1963. Not a nice topic, nor a subject you can hook off, nor forget easily.

Polaski's films I know from his first, Knife in the Water (1962), up to Chinatown (1974) without exception, and have seen them several times. Later, in Asia, I lost interest in movies in general - neither KL in the 1980's, nor Bangkok up to 2004, let alone Kunming of 1990-92 seemed to be the places, and, on top, Asian movie houses (at that time) smelled like New York cabs...

The film, in a way, is Polaski's history of his early youth in Cracow (his film is about the Warsaw ghetto, but parallels abound). He had not really addressed the subject in its entirety before - too painful, perhaps also too much risk to get it wrong, or generally, too much commercial interest in the otherwise serious holocaust topic?

He took up shooting The Pianist in 2001, at the age of 68, with a budget of US$m35. All went right - the film must be one of, if not the best, on the persecution of the Jews in WWII, as told through a story, and historically as accurate as anything can ever get. Perfect craftsmanship at all levels, of the highest level. It can not be faulted.

  Of special note late in the film is the Nazi officer who discovers the Adrien Brody character W. Szpilman hiding, and then learns he is a composer and pianist.  Only because of this he protects him from discovery by other Nazis.  Quite apparent the officer knows classical music, or is a musician.
  Finally after the Nazi defeat, we see the tragic results when Szpilman tries vainly to locate the officer to acknowledge his help. -- George Skoblin",1345161600,,660,4.533898305084746

I refuse to capitalize the N of that term because it is about a group that feels they are superior to everyone else, when they are truly not so. I am moved to always never return hate for hate, and if this movie taught me this, then it can teach generations in the same manner, not to indulge in the same mannerisms of hate as well.

I watched the movie using my home theater system.  The 5.1 surround audio is soo quiet I had to turn up the volume to the maximum setting, the voices were still very quiet and hard to understand, the action was loud but not crazy loud like you would expect.

Subtitles Broken:
I tried to turn on the sub titles so my girlfriend could read along as it was too quiet and some of the accents are hard for her to understand, but the subtitles don't work either.  The only time the subtitles worked is when there was a German sign being translated like 'No Jews', and at the beginning of the credits a subtitle thing came up telling you what company or whatever you should thank for the subtitle that didn't work.

I am very unhappy with this, I love the movie but this is basically unwatchable.  I did not try switching the audio off the 5.1 surround, maybe that would make it louder if it was just in stereo.

The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is so moving and touching that it has gotten me both times. Do I recommend it? Yes, very much so. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Now. I purchased the Amazon copy so it's on my library, but I plan on buying a DVD copy of it and later a Blu-Ray (if I get around to buying a Blu-Ray player).

The story is of a famous Polish pianist named Szpilman who is a Jew in Warsaw during World War II with his mother, father, two sisters, and brother. Through his music, he is able to survive and escapes death many times (I'm not really ruining anything since he has to live as he would later become famous again). The composition for this movie is fantastic and I have since started listening to the great Chopin. Not to mention, if you love Adrien Brody, this is absolutely a must-see film. He is amazing in this film and about as gorgeous as ever. His performance as Szpilman will forever haunt me because it is so lifelike and will stay with you. Watching this movie made me realize how easy of life is. We can get food, water, or blankets when we need them, but he could not. He survived with what he could find, even after every little tragic thing that happened to him.

Overall, fantastic film. Five stars across the board, no hands down. If you see this movie in stores, buy it. You won't be disappointed. Who knows? Maybe it will inspire you to learn to play the piano. It might just save your life someday.

1479268,4,B00005JLT5,"How much shame? No more than we deserve, all of us. How much guilt? Not yet quite enough, I fear. Obviously we crave more grief in atonement for the atrocities of the foulest century of our history, since we eat up films and novels that depict it. Do you, esteemed reader, feel guilt and shame at the genocides perpetrated by your species against each other? If not, you're unworthy of something we call humanity.

W'adys'aw Szpilman, the ""pianist"" of the film, was not a hero. He was a survivor. Perhaps that's the best any of us can claim, to be survivors. But then, there's the phenomenon known as ""survivor's guilt."" I've known several Holocaust survivors; in fact, I'm related to some by marriage. Some express guilt, some express gratitude, but I've never heard one boast of survival. In any case, Szpilman was a real person, whose post-war memoir attracted little notice until decades after the events it described. The first film based on it, made in Poland in 1949, was suppressed by the Communists. Szpilman's son republished the memoir in 1998, first in German and then in English. Szpilman died in Warsaw in July, 2000 at the age of 88, two years before the release of this film directed by Roman Polanski.

The first three-quarters of this film are agonizing. Horrible. Plausible. My wife couldn't handle it. She went off to bed to read a new ""Parker"" novel for relief. The acting, to be honest, isn't brilliant, but the cinematic portrayal of the brutality of the Nazis in Warsaw obviated any need for character development. Then came the escape. The survival despite all odds. Battle scenes, flight across roofs, the wry humor of near starvation assuaged by a can of pickles. And at last, One Just Man, one German capable of pity. That German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, really did appear in the memoir; his identity was later confirmed, and it's known that he died in a Soviet gulag. I suppose the end of the film is intended as a statement of comfort and optimism, possibly as a signal of reconciliation. From the moment Szpilman is discovered in hiding by Hosenfeld, music swells in the film. Hosenfeld orders Szpilman to play the piano, and director Polanski gives us quite a long concert view of the Pianist's hands on the keyboard. The Russians arrive, the war is over in a few quick edits, and Szpilman is at the keyboard again in a rebuilt radio studio. The end of the film shows Szpilman performing a concerto with a full orchestra. He survives. Music survives. Human decency survives. That's the message I think the film delivers, but I'm not persuaded. Not even music can redeem us. That's a powerful statement of grief and guilt, coming from me, a person who lives for music.",1327968000,2,2699,4.752665245202559

1479317,5,B00005JLT5,"It is indeed. I remember seeing Adrian Brody at the Oscars ceremony, all smiles and giving Halle Berry a tremendous kiss, I couldn't believe it was the same man who I had seen in 'The Pianist' as that luckless yet blessed Wladyslaw Szpilman. Apart from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nuremberg/dp/B00005B6OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nuremberg</a>, I find it difficult to think of another movie which conveys the horrors of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust with such almost nauseating vividness

The movie is visual tour de force without a single weak point: from the cast to the soundtrack, from the costumes to the sets, it is well-nigh perfect. The acting is downright fabulous: from Adrian Brody in the title role all the way to the end, where Thomas Kretschman makes one of the most memorable examples of the MBE (Marlon Brando Effect). He appears for some 15 or 20 minutes in the end (like Marlon Brando in 'Apocalypse Now', hence the name) and almost steals the show from Adrian Brody; quite an achievement considering the fact that Adrian occupies the screen most of the movie. Only later did I get the word game during their last encounter:

Captain Wilm Hosenfeld: What is your name? So I can listen for you.
Wladyslaw Szpilman: My name is Szpilman.
Captain Wilm Hosenfeld: Spielmann? That is a good name, for a pianist.
[Sounds better in German, though.]

The only thing that bothers me is the relentless showing of sadistic cruelty and unimaginable violence. Almost the whole two and half hours consists of that, actually. Now, of course, this is basic message and as far as Roman Polanski remains in accord with the historical truth, he is fully justified in showing as graphically as he can what must never happen again. How much the movie deviates from the history, if at all, I do not presume to know. What I do know is that some scenes and pictures from 'The Pianist' I am still not able to forget and probably never will. To name but one example, towards the end Szpielman, while trying to escape being burned alive, gets over a wall behind which a street in ruins, an absolutely surreal landscape of devastation, is suddenly shown - and never forgotten.

My other problem with this movie, a small but important one, is the heavily abridged version of Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in that unforgettable scene when Wladek was caught by the Nazi captain. The movie is certainly long enough to bear few minutes more, especially when these are concerned with one of Chopin's finest works and such poignant and haunting images like the ruined Warsaw. At least the Polonaise Brilliante in the end is quite complete and it makes by far the greatest end credits I can imagine.

Minor quibbles, of course. 'The Pianist' remains one of the most difficult movies to watch as well as one those most worth watching.",1307836800,3,3020,5.244306418219462

1479400,5,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist is a low-key masterpiece, an unusually accurate historical film and deeply stirring human drama that reaches masterful heights without drawing attention to itself. Set in World War II Poland, it focuses on a unique Holocaust aspect and is essential for anyone interested in the terrible era or who simply wants a supremely emotional film.

It is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a burgeoning pianist just before WWII who, like other Jews, is forced into the ghetto along with his family and suffers numerous hardships. Closely based on his memoirs, The Pianist is one of the most realistic films of its kind, as the documentary segment comparing era footage with the film makes clear. Szpilman was like many Jews in Poland and elsewhere in that he was variously dehumanized, and The Pianist's visceral depiction of Jewish suffering is truly heartbreaking. This is one of the most depressing films ever made in that it shows just how inhuman humanity can be; many like to think savage barbarism ended centuries ago, but it unforgettably shows otherwise. The movie's depiction of this sad time - perhaps history's most despicable - is thoroughly harrowing, a powerfully affecting experience that moves us physically through tears and otherwise. Yet, despite it all, it is a story of hope and optimism. Szpilman is above all a survivor, and the film vividly chronicles his determination to stay alive in spite of the grimmest odds. Thus, though often almost unwatchably bleak, The Pianist is ultimately inspirational, a tribute to the human spirit's power and endurance and an ode to hope amid hopelessness. Adding to all this is that director Roman Polanski is also a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor; he clearly identifies with it on a deeply personal level and even inserts some of his own experiences. His determination to tell the story as accurately and simply as possible is key. Also setting The Pianist apart from similar stories is its unflinching acknowledgement that not all the oppressed were good or all the oppressors fully bad. It is as epic and multi-faceted as life itself - a lofty goal that many movies strive for but very few achieve.

The film is so fundamentally modest in that it takes an effort to recognize its many and substantial accomplishments. Polanski and company do not let showy tactics get in the way of the story, which speaks for itself as few can and could easily have been undermined or even ruined by a less sympathetic treatment. The presentation is so stunningly realistic that we nearly forget we are watching a film - the highest praise a historical work or biopic can have. This all-important velvet touch also extends to the acting, especially Adrien Brody's deservedly praised role. His performance is remarkable in that he is onscreen nearly the entire time, often alone, and manages to keep us spellbound without being flashy. It is one of the most demanding roles ever - physically and mentally -, and he succeeds with aplomb. It is to the other actors' credit, though, that he does not steal the proverbial show; there is no weak performance, and the minor actors playing Nazis deserve special acclaim for frighteningly real depictions.

All told, The Pianist is one of the greatest recent films, a brilliant depiction of humanity at both its worst and most enduring. It is hard to watch, but everyone should watch it - to learn, to remember, to revile, and to admire. Powerfully touching us deep within and leaving us thoroughly moved, it is one of the few truly unforgettable films.",1276214400,3,3545,4.954621848739496

1479402,5,B00005JLT5,"Seeing the name Roman Polanski has become quite common nowadays, but that attention is focused more on his private life than the films he has directed over the years. The Pianist is one of his most celebrated films, winning 3 Academy Awards including one for Polanski as Best Director. It also won the Palme d'or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002. The Pianist is a Holocaust film, based on the autobiography of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski survived the Holocaust and this was obviously a personal project for him; I think his personal history is (for once) relevant to the film, because his background makes him very aware of the Holocaust and the horrors that accompanied it.

The film begins in Warsaw, 1939 as Great Britain declares war on Nazi Germany. Wladyslaw ""Wladek"" Szpilman, a highly lauded pianist and his Jewish family see their happy existence crumble around them, as Germany's invasion of Poland is well under way.. They're required to wear armbands identifying themselves as Jews and soon are evacuated from Warsaw into a Jewish district.

There's not much more that needs to be said about the plot. Unlike many Holocaust movies, The Pianist gives a very in-depth look at the day-to-day life of Jews in the Jewish ghettos. What makes this so impactful is the way Polanski lets the story unfold. We know where the story is going, while Szpilman and his family do not...Yet, we're just as shocked as they are when things go from bad to worse. Don't think from what I've said that The Pianist is just another history lesson...There's a deeply human, intriguing story that draws you in and can be quite suspenseful.

The film itself is incredibly well-made and I applaud Polanski for re-visiting the unspeakable horrors that he lived through. There are scenes that are shockingly horrifying and they are filmed with an unflinching honesty. Polanski almost always keeps his camera detached from the action, making the audience feel like a helpless onlooker. In one of the film's most devastating scenes, Wladek is separated from his family as they're put on a train to what will be certain death. It's not only fantastic on a cinematic level, but an emotional one as well.

Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Wladek and he really did deserve it. He gives a believable, low-key performance completely without ego or bravado. Its perfection and power come from how human it is and his ability to never seem like he's acting. Brody IS Wladek Szpilman in this film.

Movies don't come more powerful than this film. It's a beautiful, heart-breaking, suspenseful film with one of the decade's greatest performances and one of the world's greatest directors.
There's a scene towards the end that is one of the most profound and powerful in the entire film...And it's just a man playing piano. It's a perfect example of how thoroughly Brody portrays Wladek, but also a testament to what an amazing director Polanski is. The Pianist is one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, but it's also one of the greatest films ever made. It's an absolute triumph that shouldn't be missed.

His performance was fine but far from extraordinary. His character is passive throughout most of the movie and registers few emotions - additionally, some of the most heartbreaking scenes show him from a distance or from the back so that we are unable to see his reactions. This may have been how the character survived but staring blankly or casting your eyes downward doesn't add up to a great performance. Again, it wasn't a poor performance. The character, the script, the direction did not give Brody a chance to register a range of emotions and, thus, earn an Oscar nomination.

1479455,3,B00005JLT5,"I was expecting great things from this Triple-Academy-Award-winning picture.  I hoped for a previously-untold perspective on the much-documented (and rightfully so)topic of the Holocaust.  Sadly, this film brings nothing new to the mix. The extent of its power is limited by attempts to manipulate the emotions of the audience with depictions of meaningless brutality by cardboard ""Nazi thugs"" upon equally-cardboard ""innocent Jews"".  If you've seen Schindler's List or The Hiding Place or the Anne Frank mini series, you'll recognize many revisited topics and cliches that have been portrayed better elsewhere.

Adrien Brody gives a decent, tortuous performance that has its moments.  He is expressive in his silent observations of the world crumbling around him, and it's impossible not to care about his fate.  Still, I'm embarrassed to admit that I was more deeply moved by his performance in Darjeeling Limited--the part where he tries to rescue a drowning child--than by his passive, anti-heroic lurking here.

I also spent entirely too much time during and after the film pondering the point--or pointlessness?--of it all. What is the bottom line here?  That life was miserable for Polish Jews in the 40s?  Was 2.5 hours of brutality, of watching a man gradually starve, frame by excruciating frame, really necessary, when other, better movies and documentaries have already hammered the point home?  I suspected the director didn't trust the intelligence of his audience, especially when he whipped out well-worn lines from the Merchant of Venice and even displayed the title just in case we were unsure of the source of the quote.  I had also expected some sort of theme regarding the redemptive quality of music, but even the gorgeous piano playing is restricted to a few scenes and ignored for most of the film.

The best scene in which the unlikely sympathy of a German officer saves Brody's pianist's life is truly touching, but the much-needed pathos is only partially developed.  Based on the depictions of all the Nazi characters up until this point, the officer is an unexplainable anomaly whose motivations, background, and psychology are completely ignored.  What makes this one man good, and the rest of them evil?  Coming so late in the game, the addition of this sole non-stereotyped character with an appreciation for fine music feels tacked on.  It's also hard to ignore the fact that minutes before, Brody had been fumbling with frost-bitten fingers to open a can of pickles.  Suddenly, he launches into a ""Shine""-worthy musical performance...

Overall, a simplistic and overly moralizing--though historically accurate--depiction of one man's survival of the Holocaust that inspires horror, if not pathos, in the audience.  The Big Issues--the gradual whittling away of Jewish rights that eventually lead to mass extermination--are chronologically well depicted, but a meaningful discussion on the source of the hatred in all its complexity is absent here.",1245801600,3,2981,5.317697228144989
1479456,5,B00005JLT5,"I started watching this movie fully expecting to hate it. Instead I saw one of the most amazing movies in a long time. Adrian Brody is amazing. If they ever picked the best performance of all those to win the Oscar for best actor his performance in The Pianist would put him in contention for the top prize. He is that good.

The movie is excellent. In a perfect world, this would have won Best Picture and Chicago would have won Best Director, but that's all politics and shouldn't take away from the quality of this movie.

This movie isn't plot driven as much as time driven. You know he has to survive through the end of World War II. The compelling part is how he does it and how nothing is romanticized. Everything just happens and feels organic, not like it's part of a script propelling us from scene to scene.

1479457,5,B00005JLT5,"There is a lot to be said about the Holocaust by almost everyone, so whatever I can add will be a fraction of a much contemplated and discussed event of the abject inhumanity and abhorrence of this time period. The victim is the Jew, but the important lesson of the Holocaust extends far beyond the Jewish race because those who chose to look away and appease were not able to do so for long. The Nazis hunted everyone... the all-mighty power of France was occupied, and many of them acted as the Poles and gave away their Jews with pleasure; Great Britain, the most powerful nation for centuries before, had their very survival on the edge of extinction; the Nazis had even declared war on our beloved United States. So the identity of the Jew is not the focus; humanity was beaten, brutalized, gassed, demeaned, and raped of its dignity by allowing this to happen, and as the film shows when Hosenfeld and the other Nazis are jailed in Soviet Union prison camps, in any given situation, the twist of power and conceit can make what was once the victorious and all-powerful become the defeated and victimized.

Brody's acting is perfectly suited for the role, and there could not have been any better director than Roman Polanski telling this story. All the other details of the film are exquisite, and the screenplay, as an  adaption of the book (which I haven't read), is masterful and treated with the realism that only a skilled writer could evoke by research and contact with those who were there. Naturally Roman Polanski's own Holocaust survival plays an important contribution to the story, and the little details he adds-- such as when Szpilman is saved by a Jewish guard just before he is about to join his family on the deportation train to Auschwitz-- deliver a shuddering, nuanced drama to the story that is not formalized, but raw and honest to the reality surrounding this event. The guard yells, ""Don't run,"" and in the documentary special feature on the DVD, Polanski intimates that this was not Spzilman's experience, but his very own when he escaped from the Krakow ghetto.

The film is a huge undertaking and is unbelievably sobering. It leaves me with the unsettling and cold realization that humanity can be unspeakably, monstrously, disgustingly evil. It is important to  understand the enemy, to not appease with relative morality and pontification. In matters such as these, military action on the part of the allies was the only answer.

I add this as something to learn from this period, not as a supporter of war and the current situation we are put in now. The message of art and hope and peace and good people on all sides, even German, is not lost on me. But the distinction that should be made clear on this subject is that the atrocity and inhumanity of the period is the core of the event and the film's message of hope and individual survival is the heart of this story-- a beautiful story at that. Not everyone was strong enough or lucky enough to survive, so the story of hope is important, but understanding the bigger picture is paramount. This is Roman Polanksi's masterpiece and it is so much more than a film because it is based on real life. It is absolutely unforgettable; one of my top films of all time.",1245456000,3,3250,4.674825174825175

People are rounded up into the courtyard and selected for transportation in 1942. They are loaded into cattle cars. Someone pulls Wladek out of the crowd. Workers are marched out of the Ghetto to work. Some are shot in the street. People are sent to Treblinka but never food. Only young people are left in the Ghetto.  Arms are smuggled into the Ghetto to prepare for resistance. Wladek slips out the gate. He finds a refuge with friends. A change of clothes is his disguise, he will be hidden at another flat. On April 19, 1943 the Jewish Resistance began their war against Nazi oppression. They hid in the empty apartments. The survivors were shot after it ended in May. Would the Poles rise next?

There is bad news: the Gestapo captured some of his friends and he must leave. There is more suspense. Wladek finds a new refuge. Will he be as quiet as possible? Wladek hears about the invasion of France and the Russian advance (1944). On August 1, 1944 the Warsaw uprising began. The water supply was turned off. Wladek finds another refuge. The film shows the destroyed buildings. Will someone discover hime? Wladek plays for the German officer, who brings him food. ""'Spielman' is a good name for a pianist."" A sound truck plays a Polish song, the Germans are gone. But there is drama at the end. ""I'm cold."" At the end Wladyslaw Szpilman plays the piano at a concert. He lived 88 years. The German officer who helped him died in a POW camp in 1952.

This story is about life in conquered Warsaw during WW II. It is educational as any true story can be. It skims over the events from 1939 to 1945 to present the highlights. Warsaw was completely destroyed after the 1944 rising, it was all rebuilt after the war. One suburb, Praga, remained undamaged and was used in filming. The ruins came from another country. One lesson is that disarming people is the first step on the path to oppression. They always claim this is done ""for your own good"" or for ""national security"". After the Caesars came to power they also disarmed the Romans, and you can find other examples in history.

They gave up their guns in 1938, and they did not try to fight back against the nazis. They laid down several times in the movie like sheep to the slaughter. I began to lose all respect for them, because they did not care enough to fight for their freedom, or even their lives. I was heartened by the Warsaw Ghetto uprising scenes. People willing to die as free men, and not as slaves.

Remember, every country which has complete gun control ends up like this. History is replete with examples of people who give up their guns and are slaughtered by the majority. Also, most people don't even know what the word ""Nazi"" stands for. The word ""Nazi"" is an abbreviated translation of ""National Socialist German Worker's Party"".

1479506,5,B00005JLT5,"I've watched ""The Pianist"" twice since it's 2002 release, and felt compelled to write a review after watching it tonight. This is a well-directed Holocaust movie by Roman Polanski, and the stellar acting by Adrien Brody [who deservedly won an Oscar for his role] makes ""The Pianist"" a truly memorable viewing experience.

The story is based on the real-life experiences of Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman [played by Adrien Brody] during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in WW II. The movie follows him from his piano playing days at Polish Radio, through the restrictions imposed upon the Jews by the Nazis, the move by Szpilman and his family to the Warsaw ghetto,how he is saved from deportation [whilst the rest of his family gets deported to Treblinka, an extermination camp], his role in the Jewish resistance movement, and finally his struggles in hiding on the Aryan side of Warsaw till war's end.

The brutality of the Nazis is very effectively portrayed - scenes of Nazi violence against the Jews are usually portrayed in brief but potent scenes, leaving an indelible mark in the viewer's memory. One particular scene still haunts me - the Nazis have selected a group of Jews for deportation [including four members of Szpilman's family] and a young woman innocently asks the SS officer in charge where they're being taken. His response is a shot to her head - just like that, and her only crime was to speak up. There are many poignant scenes that are heartrending in their portrayal of human suffering - a grieving young mother who is beside herself as she smothered her own child to death to prevent the baby's cries from being heard, bodies of Nazi victims including young children, and also one particularly disturbing scene where an old man in a wheelchair is picked up by the Nazis [for being unable to stand up when the Nazis stomp into his family dinner] and thrown off the balcony. Though the scenes may appear random, the viewer is well aware that there was nothing random about the Nazis' intent - that of decimating the Jews.

Adrien Brody as the pianist Szpilman effectively portrays a man who is tortured by his circumstances, yet bears all his suffering in silence - witnessing the atrocities around him, being separated from his family and learning of their tragic fates later, and being forced to endure the agony of incessant hunger whilst trying to stay alive. His indomitable spirit shines through in many scenes, especially the scene where he is asked by a German officer to play the piano - even in the midst of great hunger, and with fingers gnarled by sickness and starvation, Szpilman is able to play an achingly haunting piece that would have done a concert pianist proud.

""The Pianist"" is definitely a memorable Holocaust film - it even shows that not all Germans were monsters as exemplified by the humane German officer who helped Spzilman when he was in hiding. Though the movie evokes the horrors of the time it also captures the resilience of the human spirit under the most harrowing circumstances.",1233360000,103,3041,4.842307692307692

It's simply the story of a European Jewish guy who just wants to be a pianist. He clearly has the playing skills of Chopin and he's totally focused upon his art until WW II intervenes... thus, the viewer can anticipate his forthcoming experience(s).

This film is a bit of a sleeper -- at least I've never heard folks talking about it much... certainly not to the level it deserves.

After a series of disappointing films, director Roman Polanski came back with a vengeance with this personal tale of survival during the Holocaust. Winner of several Cesars and Oscars for Best Director & Best Actor (Adrian Brody), Polanski's dispassionate tone is just right for this film, never falling into sentimentality the way Spielberg did in ""Schindler's List"" (the only flaw in that Oscar winner) and Brody himself is consumatively excellent in the title role (he stated that he lost weight, his apartment & his girlfriend but kissed Halle Berry!!).  I am planning on acquiring the HD DVD version of this superb film which also touches on the irony of war.  The episode involving a Nazi officier (Thomas Kreutzman, who later reteam with Brody in ""King Kong"") befriending Spilzman is touching.  Recommended for all lovers of great cinema!!

1479588,5,B00005JLT5,"A few weeks ago, my daughter and I watched The Pianist by Roman Polanski, on DVD. This 2002 Polish-French-German-British production, is an Academy award-winning movie was based on the life of Polish-Jewish pianist Wadysaw Szpilman, a famous pianist who recorded with Polish radio at the beginning of World War II.

the movie is based on Szpilman's book that he comprised of the journals he kept during the war; Polanski hired Ronald Harwood to write the screenplay.

Polanski, who is Jewish (his father changed the family name), was a boy in Krakow during World War II, and Polanski drew heavily on his own experiences to give this movie the incredibly realistic feel, costuming, and and setting that it has. The movie was filmed entirely in Germany and Poland. Massive sets were built in Warsaw, to recreate how Warsaw used to look, and parts of the movie were filmed in the reconstructed old town of Warsaw. (Warsaw was flattened and most of Warsaw consists of high-rise apartment buildings built in the 1950s.)

There is a scene in the movie in which a family friend selects Szpilman to leave the line, which saves his life. Szpilman's journal says ""Run,"" but Polanski shared his own experience of a similar event in the bonus features. In Polanski's life, a Nazi officer helped save Polanski's own life when the boy was age 6 by saying, ""Don't run,"" so that the young Polanski would not create a disturbance or to make it obvious that Polanski was a Jewish boy on the run for his life.

So Szpilman's book was changed from ""Run"" to ""Don't run"" in the movie.

Very telling, that stage direction.

In Polanski's life, he and his parents saw the erection of the wall in Krakow that separated the Jewish ghetto from the rest of Krakow. His parents were sent to concentration camps where his mother, then pregnant, died. His father eventually escaped to France, where Polanski lived as a young child before returning to Poland to begin his film career. Polanski now lives in France and is a French citizen.

This film is superb and is wholly deserving of the awards and accolades it received. It won the the Palme d'Or  at Cannes, Oscars for Best Director, Best Actor (Adrien Brody), and Best Adapted Screenplay.  It also won seven French Cesars, including Best Actor for Brody, who became the only American actor to win a Cesar.

Even though the movie concerns the absolutely horrific events Szpilman and his family lived and died through, it is uplifting at the end, in that Szpilman survives due to help from a German officer.

Szpilman died in 2000 (1911-2000).

Adrien Brody lost weight to play the role of the waif-like Szpilman, and took months of additional piano lessons to increase his proficiency as a pianist. Polanski is nothing if not a stickler for realistic details. No trickery for Polanski's films. All scenes that show Brody playing the piano, are in fact, Brody playing the piano.

Other scenes that do not show Brody playing are played by pianist Janusz Olejniczak, who also provided the soundtrack.  Featured music includes Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach.

If you do not see any other Polanski movie or any other movie about the Holocaust, you must see this one.

I have deliberately left out much of the story of how Szpilman survives against all odds, who helps him, who does not, who lives, who dies, where he goes and what he sees, because you have to witness this event first-hand. The incredible scenery, the destruction, the realistic costume design, everything about this movie is riveting without depressing the heck out of you.

A Polish Jew by the name of Szpilman is repeatedly given safe passage as the German war machine takes over much of Europe.  While many Jews sheepishly awaited their fate, Szpilman used his pianist fame to evade death.

He nearly runs out of luck when the Germans set up post in a house he's hiding in.  When the commanding German officer discovers Szpilman, he tells him to play the piano.  Szpilman performs a wonderful tune on the piano.  The Captain responds with compassion, giving Szpilman food and even the coat off his back.  Unfortunately, the German Captain falls into the hands of Russians and, presumably, dies in their captivity.

1479640,5,B00005JLT5,"Polanski had to make a film about the tragic past of the country whose name he carries. He had to concentrate on the primal historical ""crime"" committed by cosmic time and the war in 1939-1945, the extermination of the Jews by the Germans with the vast complicity of the Poles. The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story). He does not choose a Jew that would represent money or work, but a pianist, an artist representing cultural, universal and human talent that has no ethnic color whatsoever. And yet he moves further. After showing the ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw, then their enslavement and extermination, then the escape of this pianist and his clandestine survival in the hands of non-Jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty. Pathetic but too late. He sees the doomed upheaval of the liberal resistant fighters and this time too early so that the Germans can exterminate them. Note here the film never really concentrate on the SS as the evil doers and the others as submissive followers. All Germans are concerned. The sacrifice of these resistant fighters leads to nothing since it clears the way for the communists to be the only ones to profit from the arrival of the Russians. Polanski even pushes one step further and there the film becomes a gospel about the shiny side of humanity. That pianist will survive the last few weeks thanks to a Wehrmacht officer who will accept to hide his presence and to feed him through to the end , and even give him a coat - that could have been tragic when the Russians arrived - before leaving. The officer had been convinced to provide this help by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat. Music as the universal humanistic language beyond barbarity. Beautiful. Inspiring. A real salvation and epiphany for us all. That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture. A love that can transcend hatred and reach cosmic time in the smallness of human historical if not purely existential time. And If the pianist survive up to 2000, the German officer died in captivity in the USSR in 1952. Irony of irony, it is nothing but irony.

The uncertainty of the next meal or the uncertainty of the next day.  Watching this movie made me understand a little more clearly the kind of treatment my African-American ancestors went through.  And after watching this movie, I would feel ashamed to waste food.  When you watch this movie, you can't help but thank God we won this one and we've never had it so good.

1479678,5,B00005JLT5,"There are alot of WWII themed films but this one is on a whole different level. It's not about tactics or battlefields. It's not about maximum carnage and body counts. It's not even about heroism and achieving final victory. No, this is one man's true story of surviving one of the most horrific periods in world history.

This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, played by Adrien Brody, a Jewish man livng in Poland who also happens to be an extraordinary pianist. When the Germans invade, his neighborhood, his city, his piano playing job , and his family are all turned utterly upsidedown. He and his family are forced to move, sell everything, and endure the hardships of a sadistic and heartless Nazi occupation. His whole life of prosperity and promise quickly deteriorates into a daily horror as he witnesses his friends and neighbors abused and murdered. Soon after, his family is penniless, bodies lay in the street, and the jewish people are constantly relocated until the day comes when they'll all be boarded a train to a horrible fate at a concentration camp. Szpilman escapes that fate but finds himself alone among the ruins of his once peaceful neighborhood. He takes shelter in the abandoned and burned out buildings, trying evade German troops and hold out as long as he can.

The actors are wonderfully played and cast but Adrian Brody gives what I believe is his best performance ever. Many times, conveying his thoughts and emotions without a single word. He gives life and passion to his character. This is also Roman Polanski's finest hour as the sets, scenery, and overall look of the film are exquisite. He gives the viewer the eyes of the characters, as it becomes you that's looking to see if the coast is clear while peeking through windows and cracks between buildings. Every scene is set perfectly as the early part of the film is bright, colorful and clean. But as the events darken, so does the enviornment. The city takes on a slow decay until it lay in total ruin. It becomes dirty and war torn. Everything looks authentic and period like. The peoples clothes, cars and furniture, the soldiers uniforms, vehiles and weapons are all spot on. An excellent production all around.

The video on the HD DVD disc is spotlessly clean, clear and vivd. It doesn't have the bright colors to give you that three dimensional pop, but it's detailed enough to remind you, your watching an HD DVD disc. I upgraded from my standard disc to this one and noticed the difference almost immediately. The standard disc is good but this one is clearly better overall. A superb transfer.

The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus. I only listened to the TrueHD as it has a higher bitrate and is always the clear winner of the two. While I'm generally happy with the performance, it seemed a little too front loaded. There weren't many times where the surrounds grabbed my attention with atmosphere or background movement. There are some big bangs, explosions and gunfire to pick things up a bit but the film is pretty quiet for alot of the time too, which doesn't really take advantage of the surrounds. I don't fault the disc though, as it's just the sound design. Still though, everything comes across clearly and distinguishable. The loud and soft moments are perfectly balanced to where you won't have to adjust the volume at all. The piano pieces are beautiful and sound wonderful too.

This is a wonderful film. It's clearly WWII but different than most every other WWII film out there. The Pianist gives us another insight to the atrocities against the Jewish people but the film never forces excessive gore to create shock value. Theres almost no bad language to brace for either. There's maybe a handful at most through the entire film. For me, that's important and makes it much easier to watch. The violence isn't throughout, but what's there can be pretty unsettling. But it has to be there for this type of film, or it's just not accurate at all. We don't want to sugar coat this and besides, it's a true story. If your interested in true stories and WWII period films, it's an easy recommend. If your considering upgrading, it's even easier.",1200528000,10,4187,4.7458791208791204

Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. His role is the focal point throughout most of the action--so perfect in his characterization that he makes the story an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.

His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. Nothing, it seems, is pictured in terms of black and white. All the gray areas are visible. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.

Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.

An inspired, thought-provoking piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.

1479720,5,B00005JLT5,"This vivid re-enactment of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous survival of the Holocaust is presented before our eyes, in excruciating detail, by master filmmaker Roman Polanski. The true beauty of the film is the artistic, psychological, and moral apex achieved in the film itself, and in the lives of two great artists, Szpilman and Polanski himself. In the documentary (included in the DVD) of the making of the film, Polanski states one of the main themes of the film, that the love of his art helped to inspire Szpilman to survive the war against insurmountable odds. Polanski's words are so poignant; yet, one has the distinct impression that Polanski does not consciously realize he is talking about himself as well. The lives of Szpilman and Polanski are deeply intertwined. Haunted by tragedy and inner demons his whole life and career, Polanski rarely if ever displayed the moral courage to confront thematically in his films his innermost demons, arising from his own wartime experiences as Holocaust survivor from Krakow, and of course later on, from the murders of his wife and unborn child. Polanski descended into sexual diversions, scandal, and exile. How gratifying to watch his cinematic triumph, at age 70, in this deeply personal tale of courage and, not far beneath the surface, of moral redemption, a moral lesson and an inspiration for all.",1184803200,3,1367,5.134529147982063

This film has got to be one of the best 2nd world war films you can find, simply because it is one mans story, one 'ordinary' mans story of survival in almost impossible conditions.  The German officer at the end is quite rightly a symbol of hope that there is still good in the world.

1479759,5,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist is the true story of the struggle to survive the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto of Polish Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman.

It tells how he survived against the odds , hiding in various parts of the city , before his life was saved by a German officer , who despised the Nazis brutality and genocide , a true righteous gentile , Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.
Unlike many personal holocaust accounts , which are of concentration and death camps , this one is an account of life and death in the Warsaw ghetto.

The movie portrays  life and death in the ghetto : the disease , the starvation and the Nazi mass murders of hundreds of thousands of men , women and children. The imagery of the ghetto is brough to life, with heartrending scenes of the Jews being herded into and out of the ghetto and of Nazi brutality. REcreated scenes, will stay with the viewer, like a young woman being shot in the head for asking the Nazi guard where the Nazis are taking them, a mother holding a small boy who is dying of thirst, and begging for water for her child.
A little girl, holding an empty bird cage, and crying because she cannot find her family.
Roman Polanski has showed his flare for directing once again, and brilliant acting by Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, Emilia Fox as his gentile female friend Dorota, and Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.

1479761,5,B00005JLT5,"Neither a documentary nor a story of fictional characters set in a historical setting, The Pianist is the dramatization of the true survival story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist from Warsaw who died in 2000 and who can be seen and heard in the DVD Special Features.  There are some things that come off more powerfully in this true drama format than in documentary testimonials, and particularly notable with The Pianist is the educative value of observing through time the stages of dehumanization against the Jews in Poland.

In the early part of the movie, an ominous feel develops as there is a move from ""No Jews Allowed"" signs to the requirement of wearing identifying Star of David armbands, to daily abuse on the street by ""ordinary"" people, the complicity of a Polish police force, the announcement that Jews would be expelled from neighborhoods, the confiscation of property, being forced into an overcrowded apartment and worse later, the walls of the ghetto going up, selection for forced labor, family survival by divvying up a tiny candy, gunshots to the head on whim, failed attempts of children to smuggle food...and yet still there was not utter despair, and still family members had each other...there were lineups where some were selected to step forward to be shot on the spot, bodies to be stepped over, starvation, and then Szpilman watching as his family was herded into railroad cars for deportation as he was pulled back and saved by a Jewish policeman.

From that point, Szpilman goes in and out of the ghetto to labor, and in so doing aids in smuggling in handguns for a planned Jewish resistance...but then he decides to escape the ghetto and not return.  Adrian Brody is thoroughly convincing in his role as Szpilman, and the degree of suffering is increasingly apparent in Brody's face and gait.  Continuing on with Szpilman's story we watch from Szpilman's hiding place as some Warsaw Jews  resist, their molotav cocktails and guns no match for the tanks and flamethrowers.  Szpilman escapes death on more than one occasion, and even the helpful non-Jews aren't so helpful.  The burnt and gutted city panoramas, the bodies in pools of blood, the emaciation and disease, all these images...they hit, perhaps enduringly, in a place that a black and white photo montage with accompanying testimonials, valuable in its own way, just doesn't.",1169424000,3,2377,4.984848484848484
1479762,5,B00005JLT5,"I'm ashamed to admit that it's taken me four years to finally see Roman Polanski's The Pianist.  Why?  I have absolutely no idea.  I guess I thought I wouldn't enjoy it for some strange reason.  I will say that I've always considered Chinatown to be Mr. Polanski's best film, but I now have to change that and put The Pianist at the top of the list.  This film is literally his masterpiece.  Why it didn't beat out Chicago for the best movie of 2003, I don't know.  Maybe the Academy members were smoking too much weed that year and didn't realize what film they were actually voting for.  Whatever the reason, The Pianist is definitely an Oscar-caliber motion picture, while Chicago is only a decent musical.  Of course, I didn't know that at the time.  About the only thing I remember from the 2003 Academy Awards is Adrien Brody putting a real lip-lock on the beautiful Halle Berry when he won for Best Actor.

With over three hundred reviews, I think most everybody now knows that The Pianist is a true story based on the personal experiences of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew and concert pianist who lived in Warsaw during World War II and struggled to survive the Holocaust with the aid of both Jewish and non-Jewish lovers of music, especially a German officer who fed him and allowed him to hide in the attic of the German field station as the Russians made their way into Warsaw.  That Mr. Szpilman was able to survive the horrors of what transpired in Warsaw is a testament to his perseverance, inner strength, and the kindness of others who risked their lives to hide him.

Mr. Polanski was able to bring to life the cold harshness of war-torn Warsaw and the infamous Ghetto through his brilliant Production Designer, Allan Starski and the Director of Photography, Pawel Edelman.  There was one scene in particular when Szpilman climbs over a wall to escape from burning up in a deserted hospital and sees the skeleton remains of hundreds of buildings in the near distance.  This was a jaw-dropping moment of pure movie magic.  The cruelty of the German soldiers, though not as explicit as it was in Schindler's List, still resonates with the poignant message of what evil man is capable of perpetrating on his fellow human beings.  There were scenes in the movie that left you utterly speechless like when the Germans throw an old man in a wheelchair off a third floor balcony because he's unable to stand when they enter his home, or when a German officer orders several Jewish prisoners to lie face down on a street for no apparent reason, and then shoots each of them in the back of the head, having to reload for the last person.  That grabbed you in the gut and made you feel a deep sorrow for what was allowed to happen.  It's difficult to believe that this was only sixty years ago and that forms of genocide are still taking place in the world of today.  Needless to say, The Pianist is an extremely powerful movie with an amazing performance by Adrien Brody, who's in almost every single scene.  This man certainly deserved his Academy Award, not to mention that delicious kiss with Halle Berry.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Schindler's List, or simply loves an excellent movie with great performances.",1169164800,5,3254,4.642233856893543
1479763,5,B00005JLT5,"Is there such thing as an uplifting tragedy? How contradictory would that be? Well to me Roman Polanski managed to do just that with his unparalleled account of the Poland occupation by the Nazis in this magnificent movie, ""The Pianist"". No wonder it has gotten all the attention and awards it has. After watching this incredibly moving and shocking and sad and at the same time uplifting story onscreen, you would say that the most appealing part of it is that it is based in actual real events, endured by a polish musician (the real Wladislaw Spilzman) during the occupation of Poland, and written down in a book by himself after the end of the war. But then you find out that the director (Roman Polanski himself) also survived the horrors of the Nazi occupation of Poland. Being just a kid, Polanski lived in the Warsaw ghetto and lost all of his family, killed by the Nazis. He was actually separated from his mother and father, and her was eventually sent to Auschwitz to finally die in the concentration camp. To this day he admits that from all the horrors he had to endure, to long for his parents and eventually finding out that they were dead, was the most painful one.

..And just then the real message of this movie reaches you, loud and clear. The capacity of the human being of surviving the most horrific and painful situations, hanging out firmly to willpower, inner strength and love. In the case of Wladislaw Spilzman, the love for music.

1479766,5,B00005JLT5,"'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.'

In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence:

Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...

Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup...

Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...

Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better.""

Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...

Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...

Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...

Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...

Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head...

Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..

Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...

Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...",1168387200,,2656,5.022779043280182

1479788,5,B00005JLT5,"Winner of the Golden Palm, should have taken home the Oscar, `The Pianist' is, in my humble opinion, the best film of 2002.  It's one of those films that truly speaks to me on so many levels and resonates with me long after I'm done watching it.  Adrien Brody's masterful performance was rightly rewarded during that years Oscar ceremony, as was Roman Polanski's brilliant directing and Ronald Harwood's excellent screenplay.  The heart of this film, of course, is found in Adrien's performance, a tour'de'force as they call it.

Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist who is on the cuff of fame when the Nazi's invade Warsaw and he's forced into hiding.  `The Pianist' chronicles Wladyslaw's perilous journey and sheds light on those who helped him along the way, those who put him up, provided for him and even those who left him to die.  One reviewer noted that this is merely a story of one man's survival, and they alluded to the fact that that was a bad thing.  I disagree for it's a wonderful testament to the will to survive, that will in each and every one of us.  Just because Wladyslaw may not have done anything overly important with his life doesn't mean that his heartbreaking and uplifting story needn't be told.

`The Pianist' helps the viewer to realize the horrors of the holocaust, the fact that more than what you think you know happened.  An example of this is found when a group of Jews are stopped while they are marching to work.  They are all lined up and a few men are randomly selected from the group and executed.  This is an act I never gave to much thought to.  I think for the most part when we think about the holocaust we think about the concentration camps, which were awful in themselves, but even outside those walls these people were treated horribly.  Even just the constant mocking and random beatings are a true testament to the atrocity that was that dark time in human history.

As a side note I wanted to mention that, while he's only in a few minutes of the film, Thomas Kretschmann pulls out such a moving performance towards the end of this epic film.  As Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, Kretschmann shows so much emotional weight in his few frames as a man who feels pity for Szpilman and his condition and helps him the best he can.  There's one scene in particular when both Brody's and Kretschmann's eyes alone speak volumes.  Just after they meet Hosenfeld tells Wladyslaw to play something for him on the piano.  That scene alone carries the emotional crutch of this film, for in Wladyslaw we see this fear and pain as he begins that slowly transforms to this remarkable release and in Hosenfeld we see this admiration and concern that comes over him.

Other supporting actors that must be recognized are Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman who play Wladyslaw's parents as well as Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner and Jessica Kate Meyer who play his siblings Henryk, Regina and Halina respectively.  Michal Zebrowski, Ruth Platt, Ronan Vilbert and Emilia Fox, among others, show beautifully that some humans do indeed care for more than just themselves as they play a few of the people that try to help this man survive.

I don't understand how anyone couldn't be touched by this remarkable film.",1165968000,,3239,4.6855123674911665
1479789,5,B00005JLT5,"THE PIANIST is a very fine movie about the survival experiences of a Polish pianist during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in World War II. The film contains many memorable scenes reflecting both the worst and best of humanity under extremely trying conditions. One such scene shows German soldiers bullying and mocking elderly Jewish refugees and another depicts a Russian tank blasting a building in which the pianist is hiding. In contrast, there is a scene in which a German officer finds the pianist playing the piano in an otherwise vacant building. The German officer seems mesmerized by the music and grateful to be able to experience such a pleasant interlude in the midst of the horrors of war. Immediately a bond is struck between the two men. The role of the pianist is played by Adrien Brody. Also in the cast are Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner, Jessica Kate Meyer and Michal Zebrowski.

THE PIANIST was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Oscars were won by Adrien Brody for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Roman Polanski for Best Director. Ronald Harwood won an Academy Award as well for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published.

This is a film to be kept and viewed again and again, not least to remember the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews in that epoch. The cruel way in which some of the Nazi officers amused themselves by forcing old and crippled Jews to dance for them was very saddening. It is rather sad that the sympathetic German officer who was kind to Wladyslaw Szpilman in the final days of the war was not recognised and his term of imprisonment reduced.",1155254400,2,706,4.48062015503876

They are worried about their jobs , about getting food on their table. The German officers , for their amusement however, make some of them dance while they wait. That was a humiliating unfeeling incident which Polanski had brought out very well.

The main story of course if about the struggle for survival by the young jewish pianist. It is a story well told and well depicted. He survives through illness, hunger and isolation and he is at last heped by a german officer.

Ironically , the survival of the protagonist and his returning to play once again the classical music he loves in post- war Poland ( Accurately reflecting the actual story of Spilman as chronicled  in his book) seems oddly out of keeping , almost perversely optimistic in relation to the nighmare destruction of a whole people that we have seen before.",1151280000,3,681,4.811965811965812

""The Pianist"" is a movie that made me mad as hell at the main character.  If you want to watch a movie about a guy who stands by and does nothing but serve himself throughout the Holocaust, let's his entire family be sent away to camps and hides at every chance, this is your movie.  I find nothing redeeming in this movie or in the person of its main character.  I was left with the overall impression that his will to save his own skin at all costs was his primary function during the war years - the movie does illustrate that quite well.  Instead of participating in the Warsaw Uprising, the brave piano player hides.  When the one German officer in the world who's kind to him and saves his life toward the end of an agonizingly long movie, how does he repay the kindness?  By letting that German officer die in a Soviet labor camp without lifting a finger to help him - some hero.  The movie is very well made, but it's one that left me angry rather than sympathetic.  Schindler's List is a far better movie of personal triumph and real heroism in the face of the Holocaust.  As a history enthusiast and not an Academy Awards movie critic, this movie disgusted me.

While the basics of the film have been covered in the reviews, what struck me was that this protagonist is not some superhuman hero type, but merely a highly talented man trying to survive - he avoids fighting, relies on his elite contacts, and ventures out only when he can't avoid it.  Lots of his time is spent in solitude, waiting fearfully and introspecting.  This made him a kind of everyman, with whom I for one could identify far more than some otherwordly figure like Martin Gray, whose story of survivaly is as intimidating as it is fantastic.  This film reveals how most of us would have gone about trying to survive:  it required pluck and courage, but also luck and avoidance of danger.  The acting is also perfect.

Also, the extra of Polanski speaking aobut his childhood - and how he survived a near-identical situation, is incredibly moving and fascinating.  This film is perhaps his most important, for himself.  One wonders what his career would have been like had he stayed in Hollywood.  I must say that, given the repertoire of films he has done since then, such as this or Tess, his first-rate talent was not diminished.

is true of practically every Polish Jew that survived
Nazi occupation of Poland. However inadequate those
efforts might have been they remain a testimony that
in in the darkest of times there are people who will
defend what they consider decent and human - at all cost.
I am very grateful that Polanski broke from Hollywood
blueprint of portraying Poles as spineless collaborators
of Nazis and presented more balanced point of view.
And put ""Warsaw Uprising"" back on the map - most sources
only talk about uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto in Apr 1943
and never mention the ""gentile"" uprising that lasted from
Aug to Oct of 1944. 260,000 people were killed during that
struggle - by comparison total war US casualties were 418,500.
But enough history lessons.
The Pianist is excellent in its super-realistic portrayal
of survival told from a first person perspective. Polanski
does not sentimentalize the subject - it is heart-wrenching
to watch slow downward spiral where in the end NOTHING else
really matter but survival. When Dorota is praising Jews
that died in the Ghetto Uprising becuase at least they ""died
with dignity"" and Szpilman says it was all useless you can
see the man for whom word ""dignity"" was temporarily lost.
Perhaps when he accepted help from Jewish policemen that pushed
him aside while forcing rest of his family onto a train to
Treblinka death camp. Perhaps when he was beggin Nazi
construction foreman that was sadistically whipping him
to spare his life.
Among hellish horror of death and destruction that surrounded
him - especially after he understood that his whole family was
exterminated in Treblinka it was that vision of inner beauty
of music that carried Szpilman through.
That and help from few courageous people.",1136764800,3,1797,4.973421926910299
1479842,5,B00005JLT5,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" tracks the incredible struggle for survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist in 1930s Warsaw. As the film opens, Wladyslaw is recording on Polish radio, but a bombing raid forces him out of the studio and into the panicked streets. We soon meet his family: a headstrong brother, gentle sisters, and aged parents who are aghast at the more and more extreme measures taken to dehumanize Polish Jews: wearing armbands, not allowed to walk on sidewalks, not allowed to sit on benches in public parks or eat in Gentile establishments, and finally, the move to the Ghetto. Wladyslaw's tight-knit family struggles to stay together as conditions become more and more dire.

The film traces the disintegration of order in Warsaw from 1939 to 1945. Wladyslaw's life goes to new lows as the Ghetto is evacuated to the work (death) camps, and he must go into hiding, his situation becoming more and more dire as he is forced to flee from place to place and scrabble for food. He is taken advantage of, nearly dies from jaundice, and is nearly killed several times, but throughout the music in his head, heart and fingertips still burns brightly. Towards the end of the war, a single act of kindness by a Nazi commander proves that there is still decency in humanity, and finally Wladyslaw is once more able to give the world his musical gift over Polish radio.

This film, while perhaps not on the same level as Schindler's list (there is very little dialogue for much of the film, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it becomes an almost Cast Away tale of solitary survival at its rawest), highlights the indignities perpetrated against European Jews. Dead bodies litter the streets, and the Nazis indiscriminately kill or humiliate whoever they so desire. Human dignity has no worth. The film's violence serves to underscore how much like animals humans can become, filled with primitive blood lust, or like the Jews in the Ghetto, forced to survive on an animal level: an old man attacks an old woman to steal her food, and as the mush splashes on the filthy pavement, he hungrily stuffs it into his mouth off the ground.

German labour camps and the Warsaw ghetto. The ghetto is populated by Jews who have been placed there by the Nazis during the Second World War. The ghetto is basically a prison, with no one being allowed to leave, and is surrounded by German guards.

 It never ceases to amaze, sadden me and even
give up hope for mankind when human beings commit such atrocious, brutal,  sadistic  and inhuman acts such as those committed by the Nazis during the second world war.
Maybe the saddest thing of all is that such acts continue today in the 21st centaury, and that many countries ignore blatantly ignore what is going on around them because there is no political or financial gain to be had. That is of course unless oil is involved.
The only thing that gives me hope is the absolutely incredible strength, courage, tenacity, ingenuity and resilience demonstrated by mankind when faced with adversity.  Adversity at times it seems, brings out the best in most people ( not all) in terms of caring and sharing.

It is also one of the most graphic and, therefore, definitely one of the most realistic movies out there. At times during the film, things get into such detail it's actually sick. Obviously, this movie is not for children; in fact, I believe I am too young to have watched it in the first place, but I definitely don't regret doing so.

The story itself is very interesting and pretty amazing. It's the story of survival. While ""the pianist"" did, most others didn't. It's frightening to think of why this one man did not die with all the others. Was there any particular reason, or was it all just luck?

To know this story is in fact true probably makes it about ten times better, but, at the same time, much, much harder to watch.

The shooting was especially fantastic and so were the scenes in the movie. The characters were all very believable, and, basically, it does seem like it was all very well thought out.

This film was also written from a book, the storyline is almost the same as in the book, it is based on a true story about a polish pianist from the 1940's. Adrien Brody played the part so well throughout the whole movie, The struggles he went through just in order to survive even though his entire family might be dead, he stayed alive because of the love of music. This film will open your eyes and make you see that whatever is going on in your life, it isn't so bad, if he could survive getting shot at everyday and never staying in more than one place for a week than anybody can survive anything. The Pianist portrays WWII really well, the only movie in my opinion that comes close to this film is shindlers list, also a great film.

Szpilman was a celebrated pianist in post German-occupied Poland. He was developing a career when the German's captured Poland and began oppressing the rights of the Jews. We see their personal freedoms decay over a period of months and at the end, they are all sent to the infamous ""Warsaw Ghetto"" where 360,000 Jews were herded into a space that could barely fit one tenth that number. Szpilman is more of an observer in the movie and he witnesses things from a distance. A boy being beaten to near death when trying to return to the Ghetto from a hole in the wall, people being lined up and shot randomly, people forced to dance for the soldiers, a man printing up newsletters demanding rights for the Jewish people of the Ghetto. However, he never gets involved in any of these events. When the Jews are finally sent to the death camps, Szpilman is rescued by a Jewish policemen (who were the lackeys of the Nazis) and he is given places to hide. He hides for nearly 3 years and then meets a German officer who is mesmerized by his Piano playing skills and offers him protection, where he stays until his town is saved by the Russians.

Roman Polanski, who took aspects of his life as well as documentary footage to make a film that encapulates Warsaw in the 1940's. The buildings, costumes and the feelings are there. He does even better showing a destroyed Warsaw, where the city lies in ruins and the people are in hiding. You get the sense of the devastation that the city went through.

However, I felt his directing was uneven. I enjoyed the movie much better when Szpilman was one his own. The earlier scenes when Szpilman is with his parents seem forced and idealized. His father is the pillar of integrity, his brother the figure of defiance and the women are not fleshed out well, including his sisters whom we barely get to know. However, the macro aspects of the first half of the movie bothered me more.

What Polanski seemed to be doing was to show us what the horrors that the Jews went through at that time, but the scenes seem all staged, as if Polanski got on his soapbox and visually screams ""This is what the Germans did to us!"" Polanski got his inspiration from documentary clips (as seen in the DVD), but he takes these random episodes of violence and inhumanity and strings them together at one shot. To me, the staginess of these scenes seems a bit pretentious because there is nothing behind the violence, it just there to portray the Nazi's in an (justifiably) evil light. However, in movies like Schindler's List, the violence was always justified because Spielberg took time out to study the mindset of the Nazis, especially Amon Goeth.

The movie works better when Szpilman is on his own. Without a network of friends and admirers, Szpilman would have never survived and the movie makes this very clear. Adrien Brody does an amazing job of changing the once confident pianist to a quivering, fearful bum. He shows Szpilman as an observer, someone who is too scared to make a commitment to anything other than his own survival. However, this is not a bad thing, just a realism of what 99.5% of the population would do if they were caught in Wladyslaw's situation. It is a tragedy what happens to such a talent and you see his passion for the piano in the soulful face of Brody, who captures his essense so well.

I would recommend this movie, but I would not place it in the top movies 5 that deal with the holocaust. It's no Schindler's list, but it's no ""Life is Beautiful"" either (thank god).",1120694400,11,3803,4.583823529411765

1479916,5,B00005JLT5,"Winner of three Academy Awards, and nominated for four others including Best Picture, The Pianist is one of the best films of the decade. Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist is a cinematic and artistic masterpiece similar to The Red Violin in that it was mostly overlooked until the Academy offered the necessary publicity to make it a commercial success on video and DVD. Set against the backdrop of an amazingly beautiful soundtrack featuring such classical composers as Chopin and Beethoven, The Pianist ingeniously illustrates the struggle of one man to maintain his dignity and his connection with civilization in the face of a personal hell on earth and some of greatest crimes in human history...

Actor Adrien Brody turns in a brilliant performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a piano player of immense genius in 1930s Poland. Szpilman and his family enjoy a life of relative wealth and comfort as part of the cultured and educated European social elite. But that life is turned upside down on September 1, 1939, when the imperial forces of Adolph Hitler's Nazi Germany invade Poland. As a Jew, Szpilman and his family are considered sub-human in the eyes of the German government, and a campaign of terror is quickly instituted against the Jewish population of Warsaw.

Szpilman must live his life the best he can while Warsaw is fenced in with brick walls, and its Jewish citizens are singled out and driven through checkpoints like cattle. At first, the residents of the Warsaw ghetto believe they can wait out the tragedy unfolding before them, but before long, men are assaulting old ladies for meager allotments of food, and citizens are risking death to escape the horrors of the ghetto. Szpilman survives for a while as a restaurant piano player, but he's soon forced into hiding as the ghetto is cleared and the Jews are sent off to concentration camps.

When Szpilman's family is shipped off by train to a death camp, he manages to escape and survive for a time in the abandoned ghetto. But it doesn't take long for the Nazis to find him and force him to work in a German labor camp. Escaping captivity, Szpilman survives in the attic of an abandoned bombed-out building in the Warsaw ghetto. While there, he befriends a German officer who shares his love of music and brings him food rations on a regular basis. As the war comes to a conclusion, the fate of both men remains in the air as the evils of the Nazi regime are displaced by the iron fist of Soviet expansion...

Based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, one the most accomplished piano players in all of Europe prior to the advance of the Nazi regime, The Pianist is a masterpiece on the big screen. The wondrous music and its compelling beauty stand in stark contrast to the horrors of war. Brody is more than deserving of his Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Ronald Harwood's screenplay is simply masterful. The precision with which this film tells its story, coupled with its intimate portrayal of the human condition, makes The Pianist one of the greatest films of all time and a definite must-see for anyone who harbors a love of artistry and cinema...

1479917,4,B00005JLT5,"This is a poignant tale of one Jewish man's horrific, yet ironically privileged journey through the holocaust. The protagnist is a gifted pianist from a well-to-do family. Naturally, he has good connections, and so avoids the train to a death camp. He struggles through various hiding places, gets used by a wartime profiteer, and triumphs by surviving a time so many did not. Throughout this production we are treated to gentle, somber, yet hopeful piano music that touches any heart that has ears to hear.

The holocaust, and Nazi treatment of Jews is rightly an almost sacred era in history. We quiet ourselves, offer our respect an admiration to those Jews who suffered through the period--as well as to the succeeding generations. Of course, we also wonder how humanity could do such a thing--and why anti-Semitism, and racism generally--continues to be so powerful. Thus, any film that crosses the threshold of solid and good, cannot help but earn kudos.

Bottom line: The Pianist is a solid and good film. It presents a powerful individual story, well-told. However, the pacing was quiet slow, and, in reality, this type of story has been done quite often. So, competition is stiff, and the bar should be quite high for a five-star rating. So, well worth seeing, but falls into the second-tier of holocaust-topic movies.  For a more original treatment, I recommend Jakob the Liar (Robin Williams 1999) instead.",1112832000,,1417,5.0212765957446805

 From the moment of seperation onwards, the film is a lonely and tense story of a man struggling to survive, remain anonymous and make sense of what is going on in his own city as he can only view varied acts of random, horrific violence from his window. He has no feedback as to what is going on and who is killing who. One feels the anxiety, pain and hope of his family returning or survivng their fate. His struggle is expertly documented, I found myself confused, tense and anxious at each turn of events; much as the central character does.

 He is steadily taken from sophisticated young man to a half starved, half crazed, vagrant and heathen. The survival race takes another bizarre twist as the story nears it's end.

 Brodie is excellent and silently portrays this mans degridation, he seems to do this with great emotional resonance and a sadly beautiful, wasting physicality.

 The support cast are amazing, Fox as the central source of aid is emotive and couragoues. Lipman and Finlay play the elderly parents with tenderness and realism, the scene when the family share a last chocolate is one of the most emotive displays of solidarity and hope I have seen.

Upon losing his family to the death camps yet miraculously being himself spared the same fate, Szpielman's struggle turns into one of survival as he attamps to avoid the Nazis and the simultaneous destruction of Warsaw during the Second World War.

 The story is beyond inspirational, there is truly something to be learned from it. A man who literally lost everything, yet in the end still had his dignity and his passion, perhaps the only thing that kept him alive. It is the triumph of a man in the face of great adversity. The movie itself provides a distinct, unique viewpoint of the environment and events in Warsaw during the war, with great pictoral effect as well as accuracy.

The movie hits a climax with one scene, one heartrending scene, that those who've witnessed it will recognize and those who haven't must see.

1479922,2,B00005JLT5,"This movie seems to help propagate the myth the somehow life for Gentile Poles was basically the same before and after Nazi occupation.

Nothing could be further from the truth.
[...]
Six Million Polish Citizens Were Killed During the Holocaust of World War II.

Half of These Polish Citizens Were Non-Jews.

On August 22, 1939, a few days before the official start of World War II, Hitler authorized his commanders, with these infamous words, to kill ""without pity or mercy, all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we obtain the living space [lebensraum] we need"".

Heinrich Himmler echoed Hitler's decree:

""All Poles will disappear from the world.... It is essential that the great German people should consider it as its major task to destroy all Poles.""

Non-Jews of Polish descent suffered over 100,000 deaths at Auschwitz. The Germans forcibly deported approximately 2,000,000 Polish Gentiles into slave labor for the Third Reich. The Russians deported almost 1,700,000 Polish non-Jews to Siberia. Men, women and children were forced from their homes with no warning. Transferred in cattle cars in freezing weather, many died on the way. Polish children who possessed Aryan-looking characteristics were wrenched from their mother's arms and placed in German homes to be raised as Germans.

The story provides little hint of any of this.",1108252800,14,1384,5.179372197309417
1479953,5,B00005JLT5,"""WTF is wrong with those Nazis?!?!"". I lost count how many times I said that to myself while watching this film. It blows my mind that this happened not even that long ago and it just makes me so angry that there are still racist people today. Why can't people just realize that we are stronger united because we can learn from all different cultures instead of fearing each other which holds us back!

Ok, I'm done ranting...onto the film then =)

I'll admit I put off seeing this film because I wasn't ready for what I thought would be a very sad and heavy movie and while it is that, it is also uplifting, hopeful and beautiful. Roman Polanski shoots this film in a way that is very honest. I didn't feel that he tried to manipulate the way you feel by emphasizing the killings and suffering, he merely shows it to you and lets you decide the way it affects you by showing you only a little bit of reaction from the people in the film.

I only recall one scene in which Adrien Brody really cries, he is walking down a lonely street lined with abandoned belongings scattered on the ground. This makes the movie much more poignant and haunting because your reactions are completely your own instead of the actor's and actress's.

Being a pianist myself I really felt Adrien Brodys anguish when he sat down at the piano but couldn't play it for fear of being discovered. The final piece played in the movie is by Chopin and it was a wonderful choice because it is sad and hopeful at the same time, exactly like this film.

I recommend this movie for all teenagers and adults. Parents should watch this movie with their teens and ask them what they think of racism afterward.",1106956800,5,1674,4.422077922077922
1479954,5,B00005JLT5,"The rubric on the DVD I purchased stated that ""This [...] film follows [the pianist's] journey of survival with the unlikely help of a sympathetic German officer"". I had imagined that the pianist in question would have been playing in some kind of caf&eacute; or bar throughout the five years that Warsaw was occupied by the Nazis, with this ""sympathetic German officer"" being a keen listener and showing his admiration for the pianist's marvelous playing abilities.

Whilst my speculation about the quasi-friendship was hopelessly wide of the mark, the last speculation was almost exactly on the spot, yet the officer (Thomas Kretschmann) sees the utterly scruffy, bedraggled and starving Szpilman (Adrien Brody) hiding in an attic in a devastated part of the Pole's home city barely weeks before the Germans retreated west before the advancing Soviets.

The state in which the officer found Szpilman conveyed in an unforgettable way the utter privations experienced by just one man in his bid to avoid being shot on sight, if not dragged off to the extermination camps, which would have happened earlier in the war had not one Polish Jewish policeman not physically dragged Szpilman out of the line of would-be deportees to Treblinka, since he knew who he was.

Seen from the perspective of one Jewish man, the Nazi policy regarding their treatment of the Jews is crystal-clear: ghettoization and extermination. Even the scenes depicting the so-called ""Gentile street"" running through the Jewish ghetto are powerful as a reminder of how physically cut off the Jews were from the rest of Varsovian society and of how utterly demoralized and ostracized the Jews were forced to feel as a people. How ironic, indeed, that a wall would divide the capital of the (then former) Nazi regime for 28 years, albeit along political, not racial, lines.

As might be expected, there are scenes designed deliberately to shock and appal - as well as remind the audience of just how brutally the Nazis, in the form of the S.S., treated the Jews. Who can forget the one where the old man is thrown to his death from his wheelchair from an upper floor of the building opposite where the Szpilmans were living, and the one where an S.S. man picked out people from a work party, which included Szpilman in its ranks, and summarily executed them. This illustrated just how hard-core Nazis dealt with  those whom Nazi racial theory regarded as the Untermenschen (""sub-humans"").

The conditions in which Szpilman found himself after escaping from the ghetto, destroyed in April 1943, were vastly different from before, as he found himself alone, having to live in a flat locked from the outside to avoid snoopers taking too close a look. When the Warsaw Uprising starts in August 1944, Szpilman is forced to run for his life and take refuge wherever he can as the Nazis snuff out all resistance, killing almost every Pole in sight. It was only at this point that the Kretschmann character, a captain in the army and not the S.S., helps him, but only after he manages to prove he is a pianist in spite of his utterly pathetic and miserable condition. Szpilman manages to survive the scenes of harrowing death and destruction, even if his benefactor was inevitably captured by the Soviet Army and fated to die in a POW camp.

Overall, ""The Pianist"" is as much an anti-war film as it is a war film, given that the aggressors had all the power at their disposal to do whatever they wished to their unarmed victims, although the will to fight on the part of the Jews is also highlighted, not just during the Uprising. Many of the film's scenes were shot not just in Warsaw, but also in two cities in Germany. The images are highly disturbing almost right from the very start, and that was the intention of Roman Polanski, who won the Academy Award for Best Director, for whom this movie was said to be ""his most personal"" on account of his own memories of war-torn Warsaw.

Adrien Brody gives a performance which richly deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor, as he immerses himself in the character, sharing whatever joys and pain came both his way and the way of his relatives and friends, and stoically displaying the emotions that one would readily expect in such situations as Szpilman manages to survive, his life intact, ready to resume his career, albeit in a Poland that had been changed irrevocably.

One can immediately sense that Polanski put his heart and soul into the project (for obvious reasons, given his own life story), and this effort brought the best out of everyone involved with the film. I would echo many others who have expressed their admiration of this film as a work of art.

However, here is where I have an issue with this project: I am not sure that this story is worthy of such an effort. We are in no short supply of Holocaust-themed cinema, some of which rises to the level of masterpiece. Films like ""Sunshine"", ""Europa, Europa"", and the incomparable ""Schindler's List"" are not only visually stunning, but convey powerful life-affirming messages. Not the least of these is the idea that one must work pro-actively for one's bodily salvation. In ""The Pianist"", instead, we are shown a man whose does little to help himself survive. Instead, he is aided by a few sympathetic Poles, and a rather out-of-character Wehrmacht officer. The hero's complete passivity is almost incomprehensible.

""The Pianist"" revolves around this heartbreaking event that occured in the Warsaw ghetto. Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist that is respected and well-known throughout Europe (at the time). Brilliant music, I must say. Ultimately, his fame comes to an end when the Germans round up the Jews, thusly ending Szpilman's fame and gift. He and his family become split up, unfortunately, for his family, they've reached their untimely fates. Szpilman on the other hand has his life spared. Why? Because of his gift. He is alone. He manages to survive the whole conflict, going from living as a recluse in an apartment full of Jewish-hating Germans, then living out on the war-torn community by his lonesome, trying to survive.

A true story of this brilliant and brave musician, who fought against all odds and managed to survive the war years. Director Roman Polanski is also a Holocaust survivor as well. His experiences helped make the movie more accurate. He poured his heart and soul into this movie. Although the movie is executed very well... I'm just not... feeling it. Yeah, it depicts the Holocaust thoroughly and accurately, but to be brutally honest... I thought of ""The Pianist"" as another ""Cast Away."" We never really know Szpilman at all other than a surviving Polish musician. He expresses emotion, but most of the time, he's quiet and helpless. He really doesn't have much of a personality other than playing the piano extremely well. Perhaps the book can give us more of Szpilman's personality. Given this flaw, I don't think Adrien Brody deserved that Oscar at all. Yeah, go ahead and criticize me, but that's my take.

""The Pianist"" is good, but it's no ""Schindler's List."" Honestly, I can't see how people call this movie better than ""Schindler's List."" That movie established a hero that saved 1,000 Jews from death. ""The Pianist"" is nothing more than a movie of survival (hence, the comparison to ""Cast Away""). And ""Schindler's List"" focused more on the Holocaust. ""The Pianist"" only briefly tells the horrible tale. Yeah, criticize me again, but that's just how I see it.

Despite my lil' rants, ""The Pianist"" is truly a good film, but not great. But it is told as it was written in the book, and accurately portrayed by Polanski.

He almost gets caught a couple of times as well. Later, after escaping his captors, he is put into hiding by friends in which his room has a view of a section of the Ghetto and sees the uprising break out first hand. After the fighting is over, Brody's charachter openly expresses regrets to a friend visiting him in the apartment he is hiding in that he wished he was there. His friend replies that he would have ended up dead or worse and it wasn't worth it. His friend then says she is sure that the example of the Jew's courage of resistance will inspire others in Poland to resist the Nazis. I thought this little tie that was shown in this film makes it clear that these scenes are an acknowledgement that the Wausaw Jews who resisted the Nazis with smuggled firearms inspired the Poles to resist the Nazis too.

It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest ""safe house"" has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for his music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be angry if anybody but Adrien Brody had won!

But in the middle of this moral misery this fact will become the weird vehicle which links two refined souls . One of them is clear , but the another is seriously disturbed , between his internal wishes and the outside demands and imposed rules. This encounter will open an invisible gate for those men who will share far beyond his beliefs and points of view a warm and effective reason to forget though for brief moments the crude surrounding reality that involves them .
There is film dated from 1979 titled Roads in the night and casually directed by Krzystoff Zanussi, a polish filmmaker too in what we watch the clash culture between a Polish countess listening Chopin prelude op. 28 No. 15 best known as Teardrop and the curious impossible romance with a aristocratic nazi young officer due the obvious political obstacles .

1480042,4,B00005JLT5,"Based on the book by real-life pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, the film traces a single man, surviving on wits and luck through dark, cruel years of World War II Poland. Szpilman is a classical pianist whose middle-class, affluent Jewishness is not much of a liability until the Nazis arrive. From that point on, he and his family endure the slow tightening of the Nazi noose -- yellow armbands and petty restrictions -- leading up to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto and the deportation of his family to the death camps.

Like many Holocaust films, ""The Pianist"" fails to serve up the raw terror of the times. We are asked to view terrible scenes of mad cruelty, but as viewers, we are too detached to actually feel the unending sense of dread that must have been part and parcel of everyday life. It may be too much to ask a film to do this for us, but they must at least try.

""The Pianist"" is quite true to its namesake book. Both serve up hellish ad bizarre images that if they were not witnessed, would not be believed. The Polish partisan shot in the back and slumping to her knees in the street; the communion-like division of a tiny dime-candy among 6 doomed people; the Bizarre Waltz forced by bored Nazi guards on Jews waiting to cross a barred street; the young lad beaten to death trying to crawl through a storm drain; starving elderly Jewish workers fighting over a pot of beans. These are powerful images that convince because of their relative insignificance. The Holocaust and resistance were a compendium of such small yet telling moments of horror.

While Adrian Brody well deserved the best-actor Oscar for this film, ""The Pianist"" is an extraordinary ensemble movie. Szpilman's family is very real -- by turns bickering, calming, worrying, sharing. Thomas Kretschmann, who plays German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, is extraordinary in his depiction of a man torn between duty and humanity. The Pianist brings to the screen the memories of a man who survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war -- the liquidation of the ghetto and the Warsaw uprising. It's a testament to the thousands and millions who played their small parts in a gigantic drama that shaped the last century.",1097539200,3,2206,4.754569190600522
1480043,5,B00005JLT5,"To all the people who have been saying that Jews were cowards for just letting brutalities happen to them, might I say how hard it is to fight people with automatic weapons with just your fists? They had no weapons, no training, aand the SS had guns, muscle, and cruelty. Frankly the negative reviwers are quite brutal in their treatment of Szpilman for what? Surviving.  He was given a chance to survive, and took it.  What would you do?  This film accurately portrays what it took to survive in the midst of an Anti-Semetic area, dogged by the slime of human creation.

These negative reviewers seem to think the only way to be a hero is to charge out into battle, with plenty of food, ammunition and a high chance of survival.  Szpilman was hanging on for his life in the Warsaw, committing acts of bravery no one considered. I find it heroic that this man had the willpower to survive on the meager rations that he did.

To that reviewer who seems to think that Sept. 11(3,000+) was a greater tragedy than the holocaust(13,000,000+), I find it odd that you find it more brave to wrestle with a man with a box knife than to mount a hopeless fight against trained soldiers armed with tanks, flamethowers, SMG's, and so on with nothing but a handful of rifles and pistols you could smuggle in.

Brody did truly an amazing job at bring Szpilman to life.  His face is perfect for it, and he was brilliant in making us feel the weakness we feel when your world is collapsing before your eyes.  I was nearly moved to tears when that German officer allowed him to live.  That act and others, such as Schindler, brought redemption to the German people.  As a teacher, I would reccomend at least showing the parts in the ghetto to any class studying the holocaust.  It truly brings out the horror of the ghetto.

To Szpilman, the survivors of the Holocaust, and all those Canadians whose flawed DVDs kept them from enjoying this masterpiece.  May you one day find a DVD that contains all the Special features you need.",1096502400,8,2012,4.5220994475138125
1480044,5,B00005JLT5,"THE PIANIST is a devastatingly simple, yet moving, singular viewpoint of the dreadful Holocaust.  Adrian Brody plays the title role, a quiet, brilliant pianist who watches his family being hauled off to a concentration camp.  Scene by scene, over years of pain and anguish, Brody sees others killed brutally and manages to survive by doing what he's told and hiding out in various buildings in the destroyed city of Warsaw.  Director Roman Polanski's Oscar winning guidance gives us Brody's view of this event, and supports him with actors of fine quality:  Frank Finlay as his father, and most notably Thomas Kretschman as the German soldier who in the last segment of the movie joins Brody in the most moving and evocative scenes in the film.  Krestschmann is an actor to watch---he is brilliant in this small but unforgettable role.

The music is awesome, and the movie's dramatic thrust is heightened by its inclusion.

1480045,5,B00005JLT5,"At the beginning of World War II, about four hundred thousand Jews lived in Warsaw, where they represented one-third of the population.  By the end of the war, fewer than twenty-five individuals had survived.  Director Roman Polanski tells the story of one of these men, focusing on how the various atrocities of the Holocaust affected him.  In this sense the film is dramatically different from previous Holocaust films, since it does not attempt to give the ""big picture,"" nor does it show how a family or small group of friends supported each other, emotionally, during the war (as does Anne Frank's Diary).  Instead, it focuses on how one artist, a pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), survived hunger, cold, and extreme privation for five years, becoming increasingly more isolated, both emotionally and physically, and increasingly helpless to act, even on his own behalf.

Ronald Harwood's screenplay begins with a broad picture of the life of an artistic Jewish family of some means, but as the Nazis issue directive after directive, the family must abandon, first, its possessions, then its home, then its neighborhood, and eventually each other.  This increasingly narrow, inward focus to the film develops extraordinary tension.  Szpilman, once he escapes from the line of prisoners bound for Treblinka, is completely alone, dependent on the help of others--including a handful of sympathetic Gentiles who jeopardize their own lives to hide and feed him--and he never knows from day to day if he will survive till the next day, and sometimes barely cares.  Eventually, late in the war, a German reservist, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), finds him hiding in an attic, asks him to play Chopin for him, and finally brings him food for several weeks, until the Russians arrive and take the Germans themselves prisoner.

Scene after scene tears the viewer apart in this harrowing film, as Szpilman, brilliantly played by Brody, faces one degradation after another by those who refuse to recognize the common humanity among people.  The devastated streets and bleak hiding places, utterly devoid of any human touch, are all filmed with sharp contrasts of light and dark, visually emphasizing the ""aloneness"" of Szpilman in Pawel Edelman's stunning cinematography.  The music by Wojciech Kilar furthers the mood without intruding, while the music Szpilman plays by Chopin (Polish) and Beethoven (German) further emphasize the horror of the present.  Showing through the eyes of one man, a pianist, the most heart-rending inhumanity mankind has ever witnessed, Polanski's film leaves the viewer numb with horror.

Most of all, ignore the beer-swilling, NASCAR-loving rednecks who claim Brody's character is a coward. They must have thought this film had lots of explosions and guns.",1093910400,6,440,5.097222222222222
1480047,5,B00005JLT5,"Better than Schindler's list. This is the story about survival against all odds, love of music in spite of hatred and friendships despite differences. Add to all that, this is a true story about someone who just recently (2002) passed away.

Wladyslaw Szpilman is possibly one of the best Pianists in Poland when Germany invades and disenfranchises the Jews. In a short period of time, Szpilman and his family lose everything; their money, their freedom and eventually their lives. Szpilman because of his genius on the piano is saved time and time again from what could almost be certain death. The story of his survival is amazing, one could say almost miraculous.

There is also the music in this film, although this isn't your Amadeus (i.e. music throughout) it still has those moments when we see and hear Szpilman play Chopn, and it is in these moments when the suffering (both his on film and ours?) becomes almost bearable. What Amadeus did for me in sparking a love for Mozart, the pianist (unintentionally) did for Chopn.

I cannot say much more as this movie has been adequately reviewed by 200+ other able reviewers, all I can say is that it needs to be in your collection, whether you love good music, have an interest in history or you want a movie about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

This movie is incredible and almost, almost brought me to tears. If you know me, I'm one that you can't get to start crying.

::HERE IS A SYNOPSIS THAT I WROTE::

The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who, in the 1930s, was known as the most accomplished piano player in all of Poland, if not Europe. At the outbreak of the Second World War, however, Szpilman becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the conquering Germans. By the start of the 1940s, Szpilman has seen his world go from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, while Szpilman is conscripted into a forced German Labor Compound. At last deciding to escape, Szpilman goes into hiding as a Jewish refugee where he is witness to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw City Revolt in 1945.

I guarantee you will absolutely LOVE this movie.

Thank You and enjoy",1092268800,2,1199,4.486238532110092
1480089,5,B00005JLT5,"What a tremendous impact this film contains! Not only are we witness to the horrors of pure hatred taken to the extreme but we are faced to contrast obscurity with the beauty of music.

This true story of Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, will make you appreciate life and question your own character faced with having to survive such brutal circumstances. Imagine losing your home, your family, your friends, your dignity and then being faced with confronting death, not just as a situation, but as a horrible daily darkness that appears never ending. Left alone in a world destroyed as you know it, to fend for yourself by eating garbage and by checking the pockets of the rotting dead who surround you, would you, could you survive? Well Mr. Szpilman did and this film is a tribute to a true war hero. Although he may not be fighting with machine guns and grenades and he may not be actively filled with pompous arrogance, this war movie exposes Szpilman's character as a most worthy human being who sat in the pits of hell and came out on the other side a man capable of beautiful symphonic music.

Polanski does an excellent job as director on this film by capturing subtle nuances alongside of the absolute horror to create a deep emotion within his viewers. He chooses to cloak this film in the colors of despair, grays, dirty beiges, all muted in tone and begging for light and brightness. We are only allowed to see the greenest of grasses towards the film's end. Many scenes in other movies have captured the horror of the cattle scenes, in which thousands of Jewish people are rounded up into freight cars and carried away to their ultimate deaths, but Polanski films a scene that ripped me to pieces just by the jarring sound of a metal lock closing on a freight car filled with life. Polanski also manages to convey the humiliation suffered by the Jewish people and not just how their lives were destroyed but also their dignity. He stays true to the humanness of his characters and in doing so never loses their impact throughout the entire film.

What can we say about Adrien Brody? Simply that he is stunning! Brody becomes Szpilman and he personifies the walking dead. His entire being changes throughout this film, at first classy and dignified he transforms into a fragile beaten man who manages to feel a simple spark of recognition for life that keeps him moving. My heart ached with every step this tortured man took and cheered beside his undying ability to survive. Brody's walk becomes staggered and painful, his broad shoulders begin to stoop with burden, his mouth twists with scurvy and disease and his eyes reside in tragedy only to find some brightness with each chance survived. His hands become the instrument that seals his fate, sometimes elegant and well groomed and sometimes weak representations of their true abilities across a few dusty piano keys.

This movie is a must have. It will stay with you for days and hopefully for an entire lifetime. We can only pray this devastating reality never touches our shores but as life goes hate somehow manages to exist. I hope that when faced with a moment of boredom, a pang of hunger or that furious glimpse of anger we can all remember this heroic story about Mr. Szpilman and that we allow it to change us into better representations of the human race. The truth is told in this movie and it must be respected and learned from because stemming from the bowels of hate the most beautiful music can arise if we strive to find it.",1091491200,4,3513,4.670436187399031
1480090,2,B00005JLT5,"Stories of the holocaust need to be interesting. After all, who wants to spend their recreational time reliving one of the worst atrocities in history?

The Pianist puts a very personal face on the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, and walks the viewer through the struggle for survival of one man and his family. This interesting perspective should bring something fresh to a topic that isn't very appealing, yet has been relentlessly overdone by Hollywood.

But it doesn't. The story isn't terribly interesting, though the unique hero perspective this movie chooses should be fertile for a new treatment of the subject. We don't get any additional insight, and are treated to countless acts of violence hung over a thready plot.

I distracted myself with the movie's excellent cinematography, editing, and music. It's sad that I spent the time watching the movie for its technical qualities instead of its story, but I found the story to be less than enthralling.",1091318400,4,958,5.050632911392405
1480091,5,B00005JLT5,"For the record, let me comment on Dennis Littrell on his same review of this film. I find his opening statement repulsive, as he used the persecution of Jews during WW II as an excuse to justify Zionist persecution against the Palestinians here. Littrell is solely wrong if he thinks The Pianist is a film of Jewish supremacy overcoming all odds. Adrian Brody commented that in Szpilman's book (which this film is based), he narrates his experiences in an objective view. There were not just evil Nazis running around persecuting Poles and Jews, but there good Poles and bad Poles, good Jews and bad Jews and even good Germans among Nazi ranks. Even Polanski allows this in his film, where poor and suffering Jews complain of rich and influential Jews doing nothing to allevate their suffering. You can see the extreme contrast of rich and poor gap where you see the Jews in the restaurant where Szpilman plays the piano and the streets where you can see corpses lying on street, victims of starvation.
In the beginning of the film, the Germans have invaded Poland and the Szpilman family are adjusting their lives to the new ruling of the Nazi Germans. They find their living conditions deteriorate as they are hustled away from their comfortable home to Ghetto and finally to the ""melting pot"". We see two brothers conflicting with each other as Hendrik,  Szpilman's brother did not like the way he supposedly grovel to the authorities and using his privilage as a famous pianist which many Jews may envy. Even Hendrik was ungrateful when his brother freed him from prison. ""Are you mad?"" Szpilman asked. Hendrik's reply was ""That is also my business.""
Szpilman's influence was so great that he was spared when his family was sent off to the gas chambers. He lost every one of his family and when he goes back to the Ghetto where virtually all Jews were wiped out, here is a man completely devastated. We see the second half of the movie being akin to The Fugitive where he wriggles away from the claws of ever-suspecting Nazis.
When caught by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld and asked to play the piano, he plays the piano for the first time in a few years he had to be in silence for fear of alerting those around him (in apartment where he lives, he cannot play the piano as to alert everybody around him that there is a hiding Jew). This is one of the most redemptive scenes in the history of film, Szpilman plays the Chopin's Ballade reflecting the ordeal he went through. It is akin to Furtwangler conducting the great Beethoven Ninth in 1942 with battlefield sounds heard from distant.
At this age, where we cannot foretell the conclusion to the Middle East conflict and Americans squandering up their operation in Iraq, the pathetic music of MTV is contrary to music in Szpilman's time. Great music can only be created with great suffering. Gustav Mahler said that if his life flows like a calm meadow, he would not have the ability to compose anything. The classical music age has lost it's Szpilmans, Furtwanglers, Menuhins and the like. When another horrific World War comes, will there be another artist like Szpilman? Time can only tell.",1085529600,8,3143,4.7249544626593805
1480092,5,B00005JLT5,"The depiction of the brutality of the Nazis toward the Jewish population of Poland is heartbreaking and unforgettable. This film captures the range of emotions that a family experience as they subjected to the gradual increase in persecution that ultimately leads to Treblinka.
Adrien Brody is a marvelous actor and is perfectly cast as  Spilmann the famous pianist who is the only member of his family to survive. Spilmann's Survival depends on the kindnes of others who take great risks to protect him. Thes heroic acts are contrasted with the forementioned brutality of Germans to great effect in the film. A final act of redemptive kindness by a german officer near the end of the war brings the absurdity of the circumstances we have just witnessed into full relief.
Based on Spillman's memoirs , the film is very accurate relative to the book. The cinematography is astounding, particularly the transformation of Warsaw to a spectoral ruin where Spillman struggles to survive. The movie is well acted, well written and shocking in it's realism.

The Pianist basically centers around a man escaping a ghetto. This man, a pianist, travels from house to house in search of a place to hide. The movie has a great pace to it. Just when you start getting bored of a house, a new interesting scene takes place. I've seen this movie several times and it never fails to be breath-taking.

In some ways, it's similar to Schindler's List but The Pianist follows one person as opposed to a large segment of people.  At times, it's a difficult movie to watch because of the atrocities that occured.  I found myself comparing The Pianist to Schindler's List quite a bit.  In the end though, I prefer The Pianist because it seemed more real.  It must have been awful to feel so alone in the world after being split up from your family and not knowing what will happen to you or them.

1480097,3,B00005JLT5,"""The Pianist"" follows the misadventures of Wlad Szpilman, a piano-playing Polish Jew who must endure the horrors of Holocaust.  Already an adult by the beginning of the war, he suffers the growing indignities heaped upon the Jews - from Jim Crow style segregation to internment in the notorious Warsaw Ghetto.  As a concert pianist, Szpilman enjoyed the friendship of non-jewish Poles before the war.  Once the war began, he managed to hold onto enough of them to successfully escape the ghetto and elude the Nazis or Nazi-backed Poles.  The final half of the flick has Szpilman moving from one safe-house to another as the enemy goes from containing the jews, to crushing the Warsaw uprising, to crushing other resistance forces.  The story moves slowly as the horrors of war and its deprivations slowly erode Szpilman's life.
I wanted to like this flick, especially given its apparent devotion to the hero's POV.  The production values are incredible, and some of the sequences are just fantastic (especially the scene which touched off the ghetto uprising).  So why isn't this a classic flick?  Let's blame the player.  Though Brody gives a good performance, he's hamstrung by the emptiness of his role - once he escapes, Szpilman is reduced to living on the generosity and pluck of others.  I don't want to get into the whole ""should he have fled or fought"" debate, but Szpilman doesn't really do anything other than lay low.  This restricts the directions the story can take to two - document only what Szpilman sees, which would tell a good story but essentially nullify him as a main character; or, keep the focus on Szpilman himself - marooning the story on a guy who - deprivations aside - remains isolated from the horrors occurring around him.  ""The Pianist"" opts for the 2nd approach, quickly morphing into a Holocaust film which has little to do with the Holocaust.  Arguably, Anne Frank was also holed up in a temporary asylum - why should her story be treated differently merely because she was a more sympathetic character? (She was a kid, and everybody knows that her story was NOT one of survival.)  The difference between the two is that, Anne Frank's story redeems humanity in an inhumane time - the interaction between Anne and her fellow refugees framing a debate about whether all people are good, and that finally being captured by the Nazis ironically liberates her from a dehumanizing experience surviving in ceaseless terror.  The opposite is so in ""Pianist"" - depriving Szpilman of much interaction to reveal his feelings (his Polish saviors are sympathetic strangers - connected to him by mutual acquaintances; we learn very little about them or how they made the superhuman decision to stand up to both Nazis and similarly minded Poles).  Excellent production only highlights the sense that ""The Pianist"" is telling the wrong story - never letting you forget the possibility that a more deserving story was unfolding across the street, down the block or over the wall from Szpilman's safe-house.  The script makes a further mistake in that it loses Szpilman's character completely - who he is and why we should care if he survives when others don't.  The error is compounded when the script hints at an ulterior motive for the generosity of at least some of Szpilman's Polish saviors (who found that many Warsaw Jews were willing to part with some of their won possessions to pay for Szpilman's safety).  The film surprisingly redeems itself near its end when Szpilman receives help from an ironic direction.  A Wehrmacht (German Army) officer discovers Szpilman, but protects him - not only feeding the refugee but giving him his first crack at the ivories in years.  We're supposed to be cheered that the survival of the artist bodes well for the hero's humanity.  It's a moment the film crafts and then destroys.  By the end of the film, Szpilman has survived, looking more polished than you'd expect for the horrors he had endured.  Tuxedoed, and at the center of a concerto, he bears no scars of the horrors he's seen, nothing to indicate the enormity of the miracle of his survival.",1082505600,6,4118,4.892086330935252

1480129,4,B00005JLT5,"Summary: Famed Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) struggles to survive the onslaught of Nazi tyranny during World War II in this autobiographical film. Already lauded at the time for his talents as a musician, Szpilman spent those years holed up in Warsaw, subsisting on scraps of food and barely able to stay alive. Grace comes in the form of a second chance -- at music, at freedom, at life.
My comments: Everyone knows by now that Mr. Brody won an Oscar for his starring role. I think it was well deserved...it was rumored Adrian actually got rid of his apartment, sold his car, and didn't watch television, in order to prepare for the role. And he dropped around 30 pounds as well. This movie is about the Holocaust, BUT it takes a different approach than most Holocaust films... It's a little slow at times, but the movie will stir up some emotions. There are very violent & sad images in the film, and I almost cried during some parts. The fact that this was based on a TRUE story makes it even more amazing...watch out for Thomas Kretschmann, the actor who played the Nazi Captain who helped Szpilman while he was in hiding...the few scenes between those two were the most surprisingly beautiful, & emotional parts of the whole movie.
THE SOUNDTRACK WAS LOVELY: the piano playing was amazingly splendid.
Overall, excellent film about history, music, love, loss, and the will to live...the way Adrien Brody portrayed different emotions on screen, you forget he is acting. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1080259200,5,1540,4.815094339622641

To pull off the part of going from a clean cut pianist in a higher class society to a sickly scavenger searching for food and water shows the skills and determination of being an excellent actor.
The cinematography was also outstanding. The realism of the Jewish holocaust is captured in a truthful yet disturbing way. This movie brought me to the times of Poland during WWII and I felt what it would be like to be there. That's what an excellent movie is all about.",1079395200,4,866,4.351851851851852

1480134,5,B00005JLT5,"This monumental retelling of real events from 1939 Warsaw through the end of World War II is now atop my list of favorite films, joining ""The Godfather"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""All The President's Men"" on that pinnacle. There is little in my existence that presents a more shattering, emotional and involving real life story than this astounding film.

If you haven't seen it (poor you!), it's a nearly three hour review of events that occurred in Poland from the time of the Nazis invasion and occupation in 1939, through the development of the Warsaw ghetto, to the trains hauling people away to concentration camps, to the resistance fighting to regain their country, to the Russians eventual arrival in 1945. In an afterthought, it appears everything ends well...although we all know Stalin and the USSR put Poland under its thumb in 1945.

The film tells the real life story of a Polish pianist, a national treasure, that was hidden during the war. The first hour of the film is told through his family's travails; the rest through his life. His story is told in remarkable vignettes of battles in the streets of Poland with some of the best war footage ever created for the screen. It won exceptionally well-deserved Oscars for Adrien Brody and director Roman Polanski and the adapted screenplay from the book by its subject, Wladysalv Szpilman.

The score to this film, available on a remakable Sony CD, is not only a generous offering of music from the film but one of the better Chopin collections of recent years, very well-played by extrovert pianist Janusz Olejnicak. It includes one of Szpilman's own Chopin pieces, circa 1948.

My one complaint: Can someone explain to me how the little entertainment ""Chicago"" beat out this film for best film of 2002 as judged by the Motion Picutre Academy? What a travesty! Here is a once in a decade film and surely the best World War II story since ""The English Patient"" and better than that flick! Adrien Brody at least won the Oscar for best actor.

The movie is set in World War II Nazi-occupied Poland. Szpilman is a Jewish pianist, and survived miraculously in the ghettos hiding from the Germans and eluding Nazi death camps. Unlike many unfortunate Jews, Szpilman is lucky to have survived.
THE PIANIST is an absolutely great piece of work; Polanski does a startling job at building such an epic war film at such a grand scale, and also a builds a sad and emontional tone as well. Brody also did a magnificent job potraying Szpilman, and I think he richly deserved that Oscar.

1480180,5,B00005JLT5,"""The Pianist"" is one of the top 10 best films of 2002.  It was rightfully nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win three: Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  Its true story of world-famous pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who struggles for his life during the Holocaust is very powerful, yet brilliant.  The hardcore drama begins the moment his passionate music career becomes threatened by Hitler.  Its material is close to as graphic as the actual conditions, which is how it should be displayed.  Such intensity, which is never lost for a second, guarantees an emotional reaction.  All the emotions in the scenery and through the characters are heartpounding through Szpilman's entire unfortunate journey.  The immense research of these events is present.  The writer's own heart and soul was written in every word.  This project was wonderfully led by Roman Polanski's brilliant vision.  His directing talents answer why he deserves his legendary status.
The set scenery is as accurate to the actual buildings and living conditions of Europe in 1939-1945.  The hard work through the construction paid off, adding extra living intensity.  The clothing worn in the movie adds the necessary emotional value that keeps audiences watching.  All other physical details in this film are also flawless, namely the make-up and the dirty scenery (dirt, burns, blood, etc.).  The musical score was composed beautifully, blending perfectly with every scenes' particular mood.
The performances from all the actors are beyond words.  Adrien Brody beautifully portrays Szpilman in his career-launching role.  His every drop of heart and soul are obviously presented through his character.  This is one of the best Holocaust movie roles in cinema history.  His talents prove that he'll be around for many more years.  A few other actors could have received Oscar nominations for their supporting roles without critic complaints.
""The Pianist"" is a great movie for entertainment and education.  This future classic is sure to please many audiences.  Those looking for more perspectives on the Holocaust should also watch ""Schindler's List"", which offers a more graphic look.",1077408000,6,2205,5.370262390670554
1480181,5,B00005JLT5,"Iam almost speechless to explain just how horrifying a motion picture this really is! That in fact much of what we are asked to view is actually based on true events is equally as disturbing. I would find that there was much personal information that was placed in context of the Third Reich occupation of Poland and the creeping calculation of annilation that placed any efforts to survive as a premium that was virtually fruitless. That the garden was virtually barren and the green of spring was dried to a crisp is to suggest that what was attempted by the forces of the Third Reich brought the end of the world in sight. This is not a picture for the faint of heart for there is such a terrifying calculation to certain death that the only greater shame would of been when the victorious Russian Army was searching thru the occupied communites and almost shot to death the pianist who in order not to freeze to death wore a german coat to keep warm. To me that would of been a defeat to knock you out of your chair,however,thank God,that defeat was not to be. It is an un-nerving event that this individual survived and even more so why we couldn't get to that monster sooner. Though this dear reader is not to place controversy at those that perished during the occupation,the victorious Russian Forces were to be required to surrender the lives of some ten million before they entered into Berlin. Even today with such devastation just a crisis away there may never be a time when such would be the case as was told of in this motion picture. I don't like a whole lot of politics however a concept of eternal vigilance may seem more appropiate than a recommendation to see this picture. I viewed this on DVD,it was a rental from a local library. I do not recommend this film to be viewed by anyone under the age 18 or even perhaps 21. If the adult wants to view this film they should be forewarned,again this is not for the faint of heart!",1077408000,4,1946,4.453781512605042
1480182,5,B00005JLT5,"There are so many ways to review a film.  So many angles, perspectives.  Criticisms are as easy to find (Brody's long hair toward the end is not that convincing) as laurels (Polanski's brilliant use of original black and white footage (much viewable on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial website) of pre-war Warsaw integrated into the scenes of film--reconstructions, if you will.
In all respects a brilliant film.
I will therefore focus on only one aspect.  This is the encounter between Szpilman, the Pianist, and Wehrmacht Hauptmann des Reserves Wilm Hosenfeld (pulled from the Reserves out of wartime necessity), the man who provided the means for him to survive the few weeks left before the Red Army enters Warsaw, which, using Computer Graphic Imaging, is in color as startlingly real as the actual black and white photographs of the period--near total destruction and decimation of a great city.
That encounter, which of course one must live through the film to appreciate, is acted to perfection by Brody and Thomas Kretschmer, the German actor.  I have before me an actual photograph of Captain Hosenfeld in 1940, having what appears to be a pleasant conversation with a Jew, on the street, in the snow, in Wegrow.
Hosenfeld was an unusual man, leaving behind many letters to home.  He died in ingnominity in some Soviet prison camp--only 5,000 of some 90,000 Prisoners of War returned to Germany--a Holocaust unto itself about which we know little.
Hosenfeld was a Captain of Reserves, if anything, a rather stunning man in contrast to what we normally think of when we see the Wehrmacht officer in uniform, the Reichsadler (Reich Eagle holding the Swastika, or Hackenkreuz in German), prominently over the right upper breast pocket of the Waffenrock (four pocket tunic).
Even in the winter of 1939/1940 (the photo is in a recent German book, ""Retter in Uniform""--Rescuers in Uniform--showing Hosenfeld and Schindler to be hardly unique.  Schindler a war profiteer who seemingly regains, or assumes, his humanity in Schindler's list....Hosenfeld, a busy leader organizing retreat who can take the time to listen to Szpilman play, and to say ironically, with a smile--good name for a Pianist.  In German, it would be Spielman--one who plays.  These contrasts--the emaciated Szpilman, the robust, dutiful if resigned Hosenfeld, make the film unforgettable--you will not have to worry about placing it in a ""favorite's"" place.  You can never forget the moment when Kretschmer, as Hosenfeld, says. ""Speil was""--play something.
This film lasted, possibly, four weeks in Austin, Texas, at one, two, maybe three theaters, often nearly empty.  I recommend it most highly, for its tragic and ecstatic moments, one of the most dramatic being Szpilman's ultimately failed search for Hosenfeld.  Mr. Polanski has not lost his filmmaking touch.",1077235200,11,2835,5.208791208791209

That survival depended on his own wits, a great deal of luck, the kindness of many benefactors, and even the compassion of an enemy officer. The director indicates survival is tenuous, and depends on the attitude of the survivor -- one moment's lapse of concentration or effort, and all could be over -- and on the environment -- one false or unlucky step, and all could be over.
--Unlike many Holocaust films, this one moves quickly from one scene to another without overdwelling -- Polanski shoots, makes his point, and then moves on quickly, which allows the movie to avoid being emotionally mawkish and overdone (although it also makes it harder to develop depth of character).
--I saw this film with a person who normally despises and avoids violent documentaries, and neither of us felt Polanski tried to glorify violence for the sake of gaining an audience.  Therefore, we felt far less offended by the violence than in a typical Hollywood film.  It also made us count our blessings!

What surprised me is the Nazi Officer's compassion towards him(probably thinking that it was too late in the game to shoot him or send him off),even to the point of giving him his coat(which almost got him shot when the Russians came to Warsaw),but still a great film just the same. I cannot compare it with Schindler's List, since I haven't seen it in its entirety, but I feel that it is worth every five and more of its stars.",1076889600,3,698,4.295454545454546
1480186,5,B00005JLT5,"This extraordinary film serves skillfully as a poetic reminder of humanities startling capacity for insufferable cruelty towards one another and amazing capacity for kindness to one another in particularly difficult situations!  Although there are several scenes throughout this film that are dreadfully difficult to watch it is a film that should be watched and the reminders it displays continued to be learned in the sincere hopes that nothing like this ever happens again in the future of humanity.
It is of little wonder that this film that is based on a true story won three Academy awards; Best Actor for Adrien Brody, Best Director for Roman Polanski and Best (Adapted) Screenplay for Ronald Harwood.  Adrien Brody's unforgettable performance is nothing short of stunning as he plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist caught up in the Nazi's war against the Jewish in Poland during World War II.  This extraordinary film wouldn't have been as nearly successful without the exceptional performance given by all the supporting actors in this film as well who all deserve as much praise as possible for their parts.
Strangely enough, this is the first film I've watched that was directed by Roman Polanski, which is a mistake that will be corrected.  From the beginning to the end this film is a highly gripping one and I'm sure the credit for that goes just as much to Roman Polanski's direction as it does the script and the actors performances.
The Premise:
""The Pianist"" is the true story Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish man of Jewish faith who, with his family and millions of others, was swept up in the Nazi occupation of Poland and their quest to exterminate the Jewish people.  Szpilman, being an exceptional pianist finds himself spared from the horrible train ride to a death camp but must bare the memory of watching his entire family take that ride as he continues to do what he must to survive to make it to the end of the war...
It is exceedingly difficult not to find yourself shedding a tear for the events that go on throughout this true tale of survival during the holocaust, which brings that much more poignancy to the film and its story.  I highly recommend this film to any and all!  {ssintrepid}

1480250,5,B00005JLT5,"After it was garlanded with awards and so much critical acclaim I decided I had to watch The Pianist, even though with war movies you never know whether you'll get something honest and affecting or trite and clichd.  Polanski's movie definitely belongs to the former.  Charting the life of the Jewish pianist Szpilman (Brody) against the backdrop of war in Poland it's a powerfully emotional piece that, once you've seen the end especially, makes it well worth sitting down for two and a half hours to watch.  Interestingly, rather than show us a view of the Polish resistance or an inside view of the harrowing concentration camps, this is all about one man, and all the better for it.  The Pianist achieves a kind of intimacy with its subject that other similar films cannot boast.
Beginning with the bombing of the radio station where Szpilman plays to Polish listeners, his family are rapidly dispatched to the Jewish ghetto.  I've heard a few reviews stating that the parts of the movie involving Szpilman's family life are clichd.  In a way this is easy to see, with stereotypes being made of various figures such as the brother who refuses to be put down, the valiant sister and the elderly father being used for the sympathy vote.  However, the movie is told in such a brilliant manner that you forget all of these clichs (especially since it's based on a true story).  There are some scenes that are very difficult to watch - people being shot point blank or tossed from windows - but it's this kind of emotional intensity that make it all the more worthwhile.  It was certainly a wise choice to stay out of the concentration camps, in part because the looks on the faces of the Jews being herded into cattle trucks to be sent to their deaths is enough to affect any viewer, and also because it might have been too harrowing for the viewers.  Significantly, it is when Szpilman is alone in the bombed down city streets of Warsaw that the movie really scales down to the intimate and where Brody's performance stands alone as one of true excellence.  Admitedly these parts can get a little slow, but they're worthwhile for the conclusion, which couldn't have come about without these parts and it's certainly brave of Polanski (and typical) for him not to flinch at any part of Szpilman's memoirs.
The final moments though, are just sublime.  Starving in an abandoned house Szpilman is finally discovered by a sympathetic German officer, and these scenes really burn a deep impression into your memory.  Acted with humiliation and sense of what's lost, culminating (inevitably) in Szpilman's uplifting/depressing performance of Chopin, it's the emotional core of the movie.  Put simpy, this deserved every award it won, and then some.",1075334400,7,2742,4.818763326226013
1480251,5,B00005JLT5,"Wladyslaw Szpilman was having a happy enough life in Warsaw in 1939, making a living by playing the piano on the radio. Then the Nazi tanks rolled in and the next six years were very very desperate as the events of the holocaust unfolded. First, all kinds of laws came into effect restricting the movement and activities of Jews.  Jews must wear a Star of David, must walk in the gutter, are routinely brutalized. Then the Warsaw ghetto is constructed and Jews are walled off in a closed world of escalating brutality and starvation. Then they are told the majority of them will be deported, taken to places they are told are ""labour camps"" but which they are beginning to realize are something must uglier... Szpilman escapes this fate though he must watch his entire family taken away to their deaths. He is put in a work group, labouring in the city outside the ghetto. He then escapes out into the city where he is helped out by friends and resistance workers including Dorota, a young non-Jewish Pole he had courted before the ghetto was built, and her husband. From the window of the room he is hiding in he watches the 1943 uprising of the survivors of the ghetto. (Of course it fails and they are all killed.) Then abandoned by the man who was meant to be helping him he is relocated to another room elsewhere right opposite the Nazi police station. There he stays until the water supply is cut off and the building is bombed and burned out by the Germans. Now altogether alone, he hides out in the ruins of Warsaw and, as the Russians advance against the collapsing German army, he is helped to survive the closing stages of the occupation by German officer Wilm Hosenfeld.
That is the story of this movie and it's a true story taken from the memoir Szpilman wrote soon after the war. It also owes a good deal to the memory of its director as Polanski, a Polish Jew, himself survived the Holocaust as a child. It's a wilfully unflashy piece of cinema where everything is extremely understated. The performances are quietly excellent. Brody's in particular is superb but creeps up on one only very slowly. There is no score, no incidental music and music is only heard when it is being played for real as part of the action (except in one scene where it is very pointedly not being played.) It is as if Polanski wants to present these events as plainly and straightforwardly as possible and have us respond to them as directly as possible. For the most part this strategy pays off and the film is an extraordinary and moving experience.
The most extraordinary and unforgettable parts are also the parts that involve the greatest artistic risk on Polanski's part when Szpilman, after escaping the ghetto, is completely alone is a bare room with nothing to do except sit around and wait, hoping that maybe someone will bring him some more food before he starves, watching from his window events in the street at whose significance he can only make frightened guesses as months and months pass. The risk with theses scenes of course is that they could so easily have been just boring and the temptation Polanski resists splendidly is that of being driven by anxiety on that score to sex these scenes up in ways that would have killed off their effectiveness and their integrity: adding a bit of music, perhaps, or a voiceover or cutting into Szpilman's narrative with scenes from elsewhere telling, say, Dorota's story too. But no: here as elsewhere, Polanski sticks rigorously to relaying events as Szpilman experienced them and eschews any other perspective. And in fact these scenes are the triumphant reverse of boring as is the whole movie.
One thing troubled me. This film is always sold as a story of how Szpilman is saved by his love of music and it's hope-inducing dramatic centre is, I think, intended to be the scene amongst the ruins of Warsaw when Szpilman has just been discovered by Hosenfeld and, asked to play the piano to him, proceeds to do so. This scene is intended to be moving and it is but it's also surely a little disturbing. It's not entirely clear whether we are intended to think that this is the point where Szpilman is being saved by his love of music and if it is thereby implied that, if he had been a less accomplished pianist, or if he had been a fishmonger, say, or a dentist, Hosenfeld would not have bothered with him. I'm sure that's not the idea and yet there is a deeply troubling sense in this scene that we are unsure to what extent Szpilman is being tested out to ascertain if he is, in some sense, worth saving...
In any case, this is an extraordinary film, certainly Polanski's best movie since ""Chinatown"" and a spectacular return to form after the altogether unremarkable ""Ninth Gate"".",1074988800,5,4738,4.6270783847981
1480252,5,B00005JLT5,"THE PIANIST is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time. The music, acting, cinematography and the superb direction of Roman Pulanski have all combined to make an extraordinary film. It's the true story of a Jewish pianist and takes place in Poland during World War II. Adrien Brody's performance in the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman was sensitive and believable.
The story begins with Szpilman playing the piano on live radio as the Germans are bombing Warsaw.  Wladyslaw is so into his music that he continues to play even after the station's radio manager signals for him to stop. Thus begins the story of Hilter's war on Poland and the Jews living there.  The portrayal of the home life of the Szpilman family was intriguing.  It gave me a good idea of what it was like for them to live day to day under the increasing threat of Nazi violence towards the Jewish community. All of the Jewish families are made to wear arm bands and sent to live in one area that became known as the Warsaw Ghetto. Some Jews have permits to work outside the Ghetto. Wladyslaw is a radio star and has some influence. He obtains work permits for his family, hoping that would save them all, but it's too late.  Before his family can even use the permits, the Nazis begin to evacuate them from the Ghetto and load them into cattle cars to be sent to concentration camps.  Wladyslaw is standing with his family and just before they are loaded up, he's pulled off by a friend who's a Jewish policeman. He escapes from the Nazis, and spends the war years hiding in various buildings. He survived with the help of Christian friends and by his sheer tenacity.
Since Wladyslaw Szpilman wrote his memoirs shortly after the  war, his account is considered to be very accurate of what took place during those terrible years. I've visited Warsaw three times, and felt that THE PIANIST gave me the real feeling of that city.  I've seen many photographs of the ruins of Warsaw, and this film gave a clear idea of what was left after the bombing.  The Old Town has been rebuilt and its a monument to the dedication and hard work of the people of Poland",1074902400,10,2129,4.511688311688312
1480253,5,B00005JLT5,"This review applies only to the Canadian DVDs released by TVA films. Do not buy them. They're vastly inferior to the American DVD from Universal.
I bought the 2 Disc version because the extra features seemed to be more extensive than the American disc. This is not the case. The American release simply has one two-sided disc instead of the Camnadian's two one-sided ones. There is an additional trailer or two on the Canadian release, that's it.
However, the negatives are much more important. First, the main bonus feature on both the TVA and Universal DVDs is a 40 minute documentary about the making of the film. It's informative and intelligently made.
However, the TVA disc has French subtitles which cannot be removed. I understand the market for this in Quebec, but for English speakers this is infuriating as you try to watch.
Worse, the transfer of the film is markedly less sharp than the Universal disc. I rented the Universal disc and compared them side by side. I took captures on my computer and compared them frame for frame. There's no contest -- the Universal disc has a much sharper, clearer transfer.
Also, the TVA transfer has a noticable flicker to it, which seems to have been caused by using a European PAL transfer from which to make the discs.

Lowpoints: Congrats, this is the 1,000,000th war film Hollywood exuded.
Conclusion: Roman Polanski has a confident but unoriginal grip over the film - the story of a Jew escaping Nazis is invigorating, there are quite a few dramatic scenes, and the impact is strong, but...not long-lasting. It's EASY to make people cry if you show an old man being thrown out a window from his wheel-chair. Mass murder will always evoke tears, and when it's incorporated through a poignant story about WWII brought to life by a classic director, the film is an immediate Oscar candidate. I expected more subtlety from Polanski - luckily, Adrien Brody's silent, touching performance saves the film - it is still a part of the WWII infestation ('Schindler's List', 'Stalingrad', 'The Grey Zone', 'Jacob's Liar', 'The War Zone', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Windtalkers', 'Pearl Harbor', 'The Thin Red line'...should I go on?)",1074556800,4,1015,5.389937106918239
1480255,5,B00005JLT5,"Yes, Adrian's acting was a bit dry in this film, but maybe that was Wladyslaw Szpilman for you.  The movie is about him, and if his demeanor was that way so be it; but no one can deny that the ordeal and pain this man endured for approximately 5 years of his life is not intriguing and worthy of a film.  This person managed to survive the impossible, lost his family, his home, was in the warsaw ghetto (very low survival rate) and managed to escape, his profession and ultimate love (that of the piano) was stripped away from him, and even without these things to keep him going, he SURVIVED?  This movie was amazing, and the fact that it was a true story is absolutely incredible.
This film also brings to light the struggles of non-jewish Poles in Nazi occupied territories.  The resistance of the warsaw ghetto and the poles, the Russian army.  It's an excellent movie for history buffs.  I own the DVD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical films.

UPDATE: Just saw Schindler's List - Both movies are tied in my book.",1074384000,5,1039,4.49468085106383
1480256,4,B00005JLT5,"Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this film.  I heard the reviews and Oscar nominations, but I had no idea what I was going to experience when I popped this into my DVD player.
What makes the film so oddly compelling is Adrien Brody's silent performance.  There are long sections of the film that smoulder on the screen with an eerily noisy silence.  Combined with the constant uncertainty of what will happen next, the film places the viewer unnervinngly on edge...for two and a half hours!  While it was undoubtedly the director's intent to convey the sense of imminent danger to the audience, much of the film involves Adrien Brody crawlingly silently through the rubble of ruined buildings. I can't help but to wonder if the film could have been shortened considerably with some careful editing of some of these long pauses, which ultimately do not provide much in the way of exposition or character development.
Also interesting to me as a music lover was the subtext of music transcending race and nationality, even between a Nazi and a Jew.  A commendable piece of filmmaking, although ultimately not quite as powerful as Schindler's List.",1073952000,,1165,4.863636363636363
1480257,5,B00005JLT5,"It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today.  What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)?  For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former.  I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, ""Never Again,"" would agree and so would most of the population of Israel.  I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.
Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.  (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir).  Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events.  He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.
(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere.  Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war.  Small irony.  But of course that was a war they could not win anyway.  If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)
Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, ""That's what you're good at, isn't it?""
It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars.  The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect.  I want so much to shout: ""Do something!  Don't let it happen!  Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else.  Better to die fighting than to die like cattle.""  But of course I was not there.  We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know.  And of course we have hindsight.
At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread.  The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way.  He concludes, ""They are exterminating us.""
Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin.  The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide.  We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity.  I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.
It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself.  Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive.  The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, ""Play something"" and he does.  It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans.  Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone.  He is the Christ who turned the other cheek.  And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him.  This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film.  The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.
See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some.  His performance will haunt you.  Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly.  For those who have never actually had the details of the Holocaust acted out for them, this will be quite an eye-opener and a chilling, depressing and deeply disturbing experience.  And see it because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.",1073520000,52,5516,4.575788402848423
1480296,4,B00005JLT5,"Q: What was the specific appeal here?
In this case I wanted to feel that I was being honest with myself.  Sometimes I see something that I've done that I didn't necessarily feel that I'd nailed it.  But what's important is that I move me, the journey would be less interesting for me if I didn't. I felt that I had a real responsibility in this case more than with most roles because I was playing an actual historical figure, and of course because of the personal historical nature of the film for Roman Polanski, the director.
Q: He has a reputation for being quite a hard taskmaster, did he live up to it here?
He did give us a rough ride, but I don't think it was unfair.  I think he expects a lot from everyone, and I expect a lot from myself too so I identified with that.  I can also understand how he would have expected a lot from me in particular in this film because this is the most personal film he's made.  It was a huge honour for me, and I felt a great deal of pressure but at the same time he treated me with a great respect and regard to my work.
Q: How much research did you do for the role?
Quite a bit. Roman was very helpful in that his office lent me a lot of documentary footage and I had some literature that I had read.  And Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoirs were very helpful as it was first hand information. But at the same time I was given a lot of leeway with the physicality of the character, because although he was known he was no so known that people remember how he looked and behaved.
Q: Was playing the piano a crucial component to the character for you, too?
It helped my connection with the character, which I wouldn't have known prior to doing the work.  As opposed to acting as if I was playing the piano, I started to not only know the notes but control the levels of emotion and the subtlety within  the music which gave me a greater understanding of the story within the music.
Q: Did you ever feel that your own discomfort was as nothing compared to what the characters in the story went through?
It was minuscule compared to the level of real suffering that exists in this world currently, and has obviously existed in the past.  I felt that I owed that much, at least, to go there. It was awful really, there's an emptiness and a longing that you experience when you're really starving that I hadn't experienced until now. I couldn't have acted that without knowing that pain. As an actor you can call upon similar emotions and try and conjure up these past feelings and torment yourself into re-experiencing them in a sense. I wanted to know the desperation that comes with hunger, and also it was very important to Roman that there was a very clear difference in my physical appearance.  I lost 30 pounds in six weeks.
Q: Was the diet closely supervised?
Well they supplied me with someone who was supposedly knowledgeable in the field but part of it was telling me not to drink too much water which I agreed to, but I'm sure that's not too healthy.  It looked good.  It felt terrible, but it looked good.  And in doing that it became very real.  I had no energy for anything else but that, for piano lessons, dialect lessons, rehearsal and thinking about food.
Q: Were you never concerned about putting your own health at risk?
I have mixed feelings about risking my health, because I hadn't really done that before.  I didn't realise at the time what a great story it was that I had lost 30 pounds for the role, at the time I was just doing it out of necessity. I didn't see far ahead, I tried to take each day and do all I could for that day and then go to sleep and wake up the next day and see what I could do.  Aside form anything else it's made me see things clearer, and also made me very aware of how much pain and suffering exists for so many people.
Q: How easy was it to put the weight back on when you needed to?
It was strange because it totally screwed up my eating habits. I was so consumed with thoughts of food for so long that I had this insatiable appetite. I had to slowly start eating a bit because it was supposed to be very unhealthy to eat a lot, but within the first week I had to do a scene where I had to devour all this sausage, and he kept shooting the scene because he wanted something different.  With each take I had to eat a tremendous amount of this sausage, and I was literally sick because my body couldn't metabolise it.
Q: Wasn't that a little worrying?
It concerned me at first because it changed the way I metabolised food and my body reacted differently for a while. I looked different, in my face and appearance, I gained the weight differently and I thought I'd completely screwed up my system because it reset me into a kind of storage mode.
Q: After all these serious roles are you looking to lighten up with something in the future?
Yeah, I need a break, I need a little lighter journey. I'd like some romance at some point, if it was well written.  That would be great.  It's a different process, but it's somehow less fulfilling.  I don't like to suffer but somehow I find some kind of greater connection to the work when I do.",1073520000,5,5121,4.25437693099897
1480297,5,B00005JLT5,"This movie came highly recommended to me and I must say that I was not disappointed in it. I recommend this movie for a number of reasons. First the story is very intriguing. The presentation Jewish life in Warsaw was quite heart wrenching, this was quite a good angle for featuring a story, very unique. I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic aspect of this movie (beyond that it was based on a true story) that was incorporated by the director, Roman Polanski's, personal experience in WWII.  Secondly, the scenery and cinematography is well done and makes up for the relatively slow pace of this narrative.
On one hand I must agree with the other nay-sayer reviews in saying that this movie lacked so much in character development and dialogue. This movie left too much hanging for my liking. Things such as: what happened to his family, friends etc. I'm sure that given the high death toll these things were meant to be obvious, but the main character gives no indication as to his emotions or feelings on the matter. But on the other hand, given the circumstances of life at this time the story could not have been told any other way.
The DVD comes with a number of features, such as a documentary, that are also worth watching, I found that listening to Roman Polanski's personal experience in the Ghetto was fascinating. It amazed me the amount of work and detail that went into this film.
This movie is well worth a watch for those who are interested in the human cost of war or those who enjoy epics of this time period.",1073433600,,1525,4.586080586080586
1480298,5,B00005JLT5,"having grown up in the shadow of the second world war; holocaust, anti-semetism, palestine, the 'bomb' and it attendants--shelters, drills,civil defense, and stories of the glories of great war--this film  measures up to the idea of its totalist destruction as we watch Poland be occupied, the ghetto established, then destroyed, and its it aftermath, warsaw and poland left in ruins unknown to us only now by a vivid comparison of our visual images of September 11. The reality of the set, and the recent events of september 11, still somehow an illigitimate descendant of the great world war--plagued me so vividly the fist time i watched the film, that i was not able to fully appreciate the performance of its lead actor, Adrian Brody, and watch in detail, as the transformation of a human being into less than  unfolds before our eyes as a result of hatred at its zenith.
Again, i watched the film, and again, it seemed so much the same painful recognitions of what we now know about Holocuast, that i was unable to add any further revelations about its shape until i began watching the third, fourth ,and fifth time. slowly , but surely, what i began to see emerge, was exactly how it must have felt to those held captive, enslaved, tortured and killed over the rising political period in Germany, from well before the war, and until first ending when the Allies began the liberation of Europe. I would like to say that it matters how much one knows about the Holocaust, but it doesn't--it is essential in its complete succintness--it tells the tale. That it takes only one chapter of the war, that of the occupation of Poland, the Ghetto and the Uprising, the story of the Pianist itself, and his family; then the everyperson caught in the spiderweb of nazism, is a complete tale.
At first, i felt the Pianist to be a arrogant man, one whom could not see the dangers of the world, whom deliberately ignored the world around him; only later on, did i come to understand, that in a world of such hostility, such a skin can make the world bearable, even liveable, even palpable to career, marriage, family, and community. This was whom the Pianist was, as he began his walk to the ghetto with his family that day, on October 31, 1941.  It is painful to watch him become more and more disintegrated--i want the arrogant, playful, talented Pianist to return--i want him to stop this, and stand up again. As i watch him become smaller and more invisible, i begin to realize that the Pianist has learned, how to go into hiding with himself; thus , his seemingly amazing ability to hide from the Germans while in their midst. this is the lesson he learned in order to survive. the can of food, becomes food--not its diminished form--the same as the last shared meal the family has together while awaiting their yet unknown fate.
we hear plenty of what it was to survive in the camps; those too, are stories worthwhile, and eternal--we know what it was for anne frank and her family to survive, but we know little about the many others that hid during the war, both Jewish and Christian alike--it is not the mainstream topic of the Holocaust.
the dreams i had as a child, about how it might be easy to survive in the post apolyptic world, was shaken, as i watched this; it is not as my dreams could see it--it was far more that we can even imagine--and that is the very sensibility that Polanksi injects into this movie throught his characters. Each one has their own statement about the survival of this particular end of the world--and it was indeed, the end. And by the end, i began to also comprehend that one singular trait mentioned over and over, in survival stories--that survival depends upon the patience of hope to once again be, combined with  the strange twisted chances of surviving. there are no apologies for survival--there is, the feeling of celebration, more than once, in this movie, of striving to keep alive.
For its genre, it deserves its acclaim--it very patiently seduces the viewer into this world, and unfolds its secrets with delicacy, and efficacy of details and minutes and hours of the times. the scene describing how the star of david patch is to be constructed and worn, is one such fine example, among many in the film of watching an intimacy of survival in horror is given to us.
I would not have felt comfortable going to the theater for this movie--and while i missed seeing the sets and hearing the theater sound system--this was a movie best viewed at home, when i could take breaks, from feelings of despair, anger, and hopelessness that set in while viewing it. The very ability to extract such powerful emotions from within myself, intuited that very sensibility and and wonderful portrayal of this man's life during these years we are given privy to. This is a keeper, on the shelf, along with others, on the subject. I am hoping that there will be a study guide for this move, soon in print.",1073088000,2,4933,4.640732265446224
1480299,2,B00005JLT5,"Even though I'm simply echoing stuff that a lot of other negative reviewers have said, I feel I must help counter all the mysteriously great reviews this film got!  Adrien Brody TOTALLY didn't deserve the Oscar for this -- hell, he hardly even has any lines, and spends most of the movie hiding like a rat, with an expressionless face, watching Nazi atrocities out of his window!  And (though this is not Brody's fault) his character is totally unsympathetic and cares for no one but himself.  All the Nazi brutalities have been shown ad nauseam in other, far-better movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful.""  As someone else said, I think this movie (and Brody) did well because 1) it's a Polanski film (whoopee), and 2) it's about a politically correct subject.  Frankly, I don't need any more movies about the Holocaust unless they have something new to say about it -- and this film definitely doesn't.",1073088000,11,920,4.7974683544303796
1480300,5,B00005JLT5,"Why live in a make believe world when the real world is so much more intriguing?
This film tells the story of a pianist who struggled for survival during the Warsaw Getto Uprising in WWII.  I was glued to my seat.  The book from which this film was adapted is more of a journal than a novel.  It was written just after the event, so the memories depicted are fresh.
The bonus menu is also strong.  The film peaked my interest to learn more and the bonus specials filled in the missing gaps, complete with shots of the main character in old age and film clips and photos from the Warsaw uprising.
This is not a ""feel good"" movie.  You won't smile, but you will come away a little richer.",1072915200,6,686,4.246153846153846
1480301,4,B00005JLT5,"As all viewers would have known, this is a great movie.  It is a personal movie for Roman Polanski as much as ""Schindler's List"" to Steven Spielberg.  It's not for me to say that which one is better than another because I don't believe a comparison is needed.  Rather, I would rather treat them as two different entities.  Whilst their cores are different, one depicting how one soul is saved by reluctantly saving countless of lives, the other is about surviving the hardship during the occupation of Poland during World War 2, both of them attempted to convey  the potential evils that we humans could become.  From this movie, I learnt of the ghettos, the walls that separated the Jews from the others not unlike the Berlin Wall, the kinds of humiliations & indignities that Jews needed to live through during those oppressive periods.  I also learnt that there was a disunity among Jews during that time.  Some were Germans lackeys & some totally opposed to them.  There were many poignant moments.  Out of those hard time, we were also shown the generosity & compassion that came from people from all walks of life & race (including a high up German officer) to assist Brody's character despite the danger that they might brought to themselves.  The movie never rushed & it gradually revealed itself like a great story book.  We rejoiced & elated for the survivors when the world was all over.  It's about triumph of human spirits.  I guess if we believe much in ourselves, we shall conquer all adversities.  This movie is just the right reminder for us all.  A beautiful movie that's ""enjoyable"" to watch.  Highly recommended.  In terms of technical information, the DVD set comprises of two CDs, one a feature movie & the other, a documentary depicting how the movie is made.  Highly recommended.",1072828800,4,1803,4.776699029126213
1480302,5,B00005JLT5,"As I get older, I tend to appreciate ""historical"" movies.  I often learn lessons that I never knew took place.  This movie is one of those.  When it came out, I thought it would be extremely boring.  It premiered on TV last night.  I watched something else.  I happened to turn my TV on very early this morning and it was on.  Figuring I'd be bored, I expected to turn the TV off very early into the film. I was VERY wrong.
I couldn't turn the TV off.  I learned about a part of history I didn't even realize took place.  I felt for the Jewish people and the fear, torture and often, eventual death, they encountered.  This took place only because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs.
I applaud Roman Polanski for his outstanding directorship (he definitely earned his Oscar).  The movie was very realistic and allows the viewer to ""see"" what happened a mere 60 year ago.  I believe this is partially due to his own life experiences.  He had fantastic control over what appeared to be a high number of ""unnamed"" extras.  The realism of the costumes and behaviors were also excellent.  But how can I forget Mr. Brody, an Oscar winner himself.  He was outstanding.  His character made his experiences a lasting impression on me.  It makes me think of what is going on in our world even today.
The final lesson I learned was we need peace worldwide.  If you watch this movie and aren't moved, take the temperature of your heart because it obviously has a slight chill to it.",1072569600,3,1476,4.481203007518797
1480303,4,B00005JLT5,"""The Pianist"" wasn't an easy movie to watch, and it's proven even harder for me to review.  To put it mildly, this isn't a feel-good movie, and I certainly wouldn't recommmend it to everyone.  Telling the story of a young Jewish piano prodigy who manages to survive the Nazi occupation of Poland, this film is almost unfailingly bleak and depressing, practically making ""Schindler's List"" seem cheery by comparison.  I've read about the Nazis' incredibly harsh rule in the conquered territories of eastern Europe, but seeing it on screen is still daunting, and Roman Polanski's camera is there to capture the physical and mental devastation that World War II brought to Poland.  Not a movie you'd go to on a first date, to be sure.
Throughout the harrowing first half of the movie, we see the humanity of the ghettoized Jews reduced by degrees until their lives have become as meaningless and disposable as those of cattle.  There are some brutal scenes of schockingly callous violence perpetrated by German soldiers, but the violence itself isn't even the worst part.  The systematic denial of humanity that enabled such senseless mass killing is much worse, especially since we still see this going on in various conflicts today.  And unfortunately, you can't remind yourself that it's just a movie.
As reviewers more eloquent than I have pointed out, protagonist Wladyslaw Spzilman isn't even really a hero.  Those Jews smart enough to realize their impending fate and brave enough to fight back are killed just like the rest.  His experiences during the German occupation of Poland don't constitute a tale of heroism so much as they illustrate the power of man's primal urge to survive.  Once Spzilman goes into hiding with the help of a few good Samaritans, nothing much happens; by then the psychological damage has been done anyway.  The prevailing failing of this second hour is one of the overwhelming emptiness that characterizes a country turned into a wasteland.
By hiding out Spzilman has escaped the death camps, but his fight certainly isn't over.  Not only does he have to worry about getting through the rest of the war in the most hostile environment imaginable, but there's a question that nagged at me throughout the movie: does Spzilman even manage to retain any of what made life worth living in the first place?  How could anyone?  That's why the famous late-movie piano-playing scene assumes such importance.  When Spzilman plays for a sympathetic German officer, it's not only a moment of catharsis for the audience, it's a reaffirmation of his very humanity.
In the end, ""The Pianist"" is worth watching, even if, like me, you may decide afterwards that you have no urge to see it again.  If nothing else, it serves as an example of what can result from failure to acknowledge our shared humanity.  That said, Polanski's portrayal of the Holocaust is surprisingly free of political correctness, making clear that there were good Germans and bad Jews to be found.  Unfortunately, moral ambiguity is often in short supply in Hollywood, but this is hardly a Hollywood movie.  It doesn't go down anywhere near that easily, which is part of what makes it so compelling.",1072569600,12,3189,4.9605263157894735

1480305,5,B00005JLT5,"There have been many films on the Holocaust, but Roman Polanski's film about Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist who survived against incredible odds, is probably the most perfect film on the subject I've seen.
Szpilman is a real person, a talented pianist who played regularly on Warsaw Radio. His story is told in this film with a script that is economical of words,  using action to show what Szpilman does to survive the Warsaw Ghetto, where many died of starvation, then  being arbitrarily pulled out of line while boarding the cattle cars to Treblinka and being forced to hide in the city. He is befriended along the way, and finally by a most unlikely person. As we watch the horror of the Holocaust occurring in the background, we realize that Szpilman was the lucky pearl that rolled under the couch and was spared while so many others were consumed in the conflagration.
Polanski shows himself to be one of the most masterful of directors, never lowering himself to shock or sentimentality. The sets, filmed in Germany's ""Hollywood"" Babelsberg, are phenomenally realistic. I've seen photos of Berlin after it was bombed; the scenes of the destruction of Warsaw are not exaggerated.
The actors (including the well-known German television and film actor Thomas Kretschmann as a German officer) were well-cast and well-directed. Adrien Brody, as Szpilman, looks and acts the part of both a pianist of great talent and a malnourished fugitive from the Nazis, losing 30 pounds during the filming to depict the part accurately.

The DVD itself is a must-own, along with ""Sophie's Choice"".",1071360000,4,487,4.674418604651163
1480338,4,B00005JLT5,"I guess we have all tendencies to compare this movie with the Shindler's list. This movie is certainly very close to the reality and as a matter of fact, it's really well done. I will mostly compare this to the movie serie named HOLOCAUST filmed in the 80's with Meryl Streep
You become easily like involved in the story. If you want to compare with the Shindler's list, I will say the Spielberg's work was more telling about the period, the fate of most of the jews. Polansky tells about the fate of just one character walking in what Spielberg described.
The pianist is someone who will have a lonely journey and it for sure makes the story,not less interesting, but flatter or quieter than the Shindler's list. Adrien Brody is simply excellent and it's an actor I'd like to see more often.
Last thing, please try to get and watch Night and Fog, it's a french 30 minutes documentary by Alain Resnais. In it, no actor but real pictures, real people and I can tell you, It will certainly be the more horrible thing you have ever seen on a screen making very weak everything you saw about the subject.",1071360000,4,1100,4.477611940298507
1480339,2,B00005JLT5,"This film is competently made, even very involving in the beginning, but the disappearance of the Pianist's entire family so early on and endless shots of him staring out of various windows made me think there was a more interesting story going on elsewhere.
It would have had a much more profound effect if I'd never seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's best ""adult"" masterpiece, but I kept comparing the atrocities of this film's color scenes of horror with Spielberg's black-and-white ones and had to go with SCHINDLER every time.
I've always loved what Polanski did with THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY and especially CHINATOWN, but I've been scratching my head since then with efforts like FRANTIC, BITTER MOON and THE NINTH GATE.
THE PIANIST is one of his great films told at the pace of one of his bad films.

1480341,1,B00005JLT5,"I honestly couldn't be more bored or annoyed by this movie. It depicts the life and conditions of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation of Poland during WWII, and probably does a very good job of showing what conditions were like, and the horror and suffering inflicted on the Jewish people, but it just isn't entertainment! There comes a point in the movie - about half way through - when you realise that nothing is actually going to happen. It almost seems as though only half a script was written and the rest of the movie needs to be filled in with a haggard looking pianist staring out of various windows. Yes, I know that the intention was to make the viewer feel the tedium and claustrophobic conditions that the pianist was enduring, but it just isn't interesting! I don't really think that the life story of...I can't actually remember his name so you see how much impact this movie had on me...was actually worth making a movie about in the first place! This was just an overindulgence of the part of some writer and director, and such a shallow movie with underdeveloped characters, not to mention the apathy! This film only really showed me three things about the nature of people. (1) Everyone in this movie cares for nothing other than himself - even the pianist who seems to care little for the fate of his family as long as he is OK. Everyone is on the take - even the ""nice"" guy who is supposed to be collecting for the pianist is creaming off the money and letting the pianist get sick - is there noone in this movie with any human decency? (2) The Jews simply allowed their fate to happen to them without so much as an attempt to fight back until it was all too late. Those thousands of Jews in Warsaw could have made a real problem for the Nazis if they had just had the backbone to do something about it! (Again, I'm not saying they don't - this is the message I am getting from this movie). There are so many hints that they are going to fight back, but the vast majority end in apathy! (3) All Germans are evil. By the time we have witnessed the many horrendous acts of cruelty we see so many of the Germans comitting, the one German who is supposed to redeem the others at the end of the film, just doesn't have any significance. Also, as ALL the Germans are portrayed as evil and brutal, the kindness of the German officer who brings the pianist food is now way out of character. I am aware of the brutality committed by the Nazis, but the overindulgence in brutality this film portrays can have but one goal - to pit people against the Germans! Do we really need to dredge up all that hatred again and again as the world is supposedly becoming a closer community? I think not! If you want to be bored, depressed and feel very negative about humankind, then this is the movie for you! If you want to be entertained, then go and watch the Star Wars collection!",1070409600,21,2890,4.37360594795539
1480342,4,B00005JLT5,"I am kind of torn as to what to think about this movie.  While watching it, I was annoyed because I have seen it all before.  There have been tons of movies on holocaust and of the individual incidents displayed here.  There is even a movie that covers the Warsaw ghetto rebellion in much more depth.  This movie didn't really say anything new.  But, then I think, so what.  There are tons of great movies out there that are remakes or cover old ground.
The real beauty of this movie is the vivid recreation of Warsaw during WWII.  You really get the feeling that you are there.  That makes this movie a journey worth taking.
The movie does have some problems.  The hero is not very engaging.  He is like Candide who experiences one adventure after the other, without making any impact.  All he is there for is to have someone's eyes to see the action.
Roman Polanski, the director, talks about how this character represents an affirmation and celebration of life.  I don't get that feeling at all.  You especially get no feeling of how this event affected him, shaped him or how he moved on after the war.
The other problem with this movie is that it is just boring and slow in some parts.  Too much time is spent sitting around in a room with nothing happening.  In some respects, this does give you an idea of tedious and boring his life must have been at times, but you really don't get an idea of how he responded to it.
The main bonus features of the DVD is a ""making of"" short and bio of the director, Roman Polanski. It shows why he had such passion for making the movie.  It explains how Polanksi grew up during WWII in Poland and how he suffered through some of the atrociities.
But, Polanski painful childhood is still no excuse for what he did later in life.  He drugged and sodomized a thirteen year old girl in the US and then fled to Europe.  Should we be honoring such a person?",1069372800,2,1894,4.347578347578348
1480343,5,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist is an amazing film on all counts and could well be the best film from Polanski and his most personal work to date. The best way to describe The Pianist is by sticking Robinson Crusoe in the middle of a Nazi Holocaust.
Holocaust films are always striving to get at you emotionally by creating good guy bad guy type scenarios. The truth is that The Pianist is not really concentrating too much on delivering a Holocaust movie. Instead it aims for telling the tale of a feeble piano player trying to survive Polish Nazi occupation. The premise is a simple one. The Pianist is not like his brothers, sisters or friends who are all actively seeking ways to rebel against the Nazis. Instead he is just trying to stay alive in order to engage in his one passion in life - playing the piano.
Basically the film starts with Wladyslaw Szpilman (An amazing Adrian Brody!) learning with his family that the Nazis are making decrees against the Jews. You see the elevating intensity of a rich family suddenly being relocated to a confined Jewish district and then the horrors start to build up from simple street provocations to full out mass murders in public view. The buildup is powerful and horrifying. The things you see in this film will make you angry and mad, but the Holocaust is not really what is at the heart of this film.
Wladyslaw is just a Piano player and can do very little to stop what is going on. He does not wish to join any revolution and tries to stay out of the way being hospitable and polite when he can. As the world collapses around him he finds his life spared from the concentration camps only to be catapulted from the frying pan into the fire as he tries to survive in solitary either with the help of Jewish sympathizers or by living among the rumbled ruins in search of food. Seeing the world through the eyes of Wladyslaw is what this film is all about and Brody gives his best performances when he is alone with nobody to talk too or anything to say. Just seeing him stagger around in search of food is like nothing you have seen before or will see again.
Sure the encounter with the Nazi commander at the end is a little hard to believe and it does border on the fantastic as if to create a musical plot twist for our pivotal character but then again it is based on a true story and these things did happen so it is believable in an unlikely sort of way.
At its core, The Pianist is a survival movie about one man trying to last among the rubbles and ruins. At times it is surreal and at others it is devastatingly emotionally potent. This is one of the best films of the 21st century and you should certainly not miss out on seeing this drama. The set designs, plot, script, costumes, acting and action sequences are all on top form. For realism it is simply unparalleled by any film of its kind.

It's true that this is another movie on Jew's sufferings of world war 2 but this is the best of all put together. It is a movie based on a life of a true artist Wladyslav Sh. and it was directed by an excellent director Roman Polanski.
The images throughout the movies are so real. Tears streamed down my face so many times as I watched this movie and I swear to God up to now I watched it nearly ten times so far and each time I feel more sympathetic to what this remarkable man went through.

1480377,4,B00005JLT5,"There are plenty of subtle, powerful moments in this film, but the best one is near the end when the pianist literally plays for his life. To prove he's not just a simple Jew --- a nobody whose life has no value in World War II Warsaw --- he has to play piano beautifully in front of a Nazi officer. When the Nazi sits down, stunned, overwhelmed by the music, you understand why. You feel what he feels.
That's quite a feat when you make a movie for a 21st century audience. How many of us sit at home listening to piano concertos with our mouths gaping, in awe of the music? Somehow, Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski make it work. You get so immersed in the world of The Pianist, you find it easy to put yourself in the shoes of the Jews and the Nazis. Instead of a history lesson, you get a portrait of people who lived it.
The rest of the film builds up to the piano-playing moment, adding one small detail after another. From the start in the Warsaw neighborhood, the tension builds. Halfway through the story, you realize that anyone can die at any moment. Even the title character himself could die before the credits roll.
The costumes and sets are so perfect, the film has a documentary feel. When Jews are sweating in the sun in a courtyard, you know just how exhausted and hungry they are. When the pianist blows his cover in a secret apartment by knocking down a stack of dishes, its a moment as frightening as anything in a horror movie.
This is the kind of movie you'll want to watch twice even though you didn't really *enjoy* it. Seeing this story on the screen is quite an experience, but not something you look forward to. It's a testament to Polanski and Adrien Brody's skill that they've created something so special ---- a horrifying tale, beautifully told.",1067040000,2,1776,4.4176829268292686
1480378,3,B00005JLT5,"The story is about a Pianist surviving during the World War II in Poland. How many movies have come on the backdrop of World War II and Germans, Concentration Camp?
I was expecting some heroic act by the pianist - at least during the time when he was collecting pistols in the German camp or while throwing guns to the ghetto. Although I do not expect Arnold kind of heroism, I was expecting something a normal human being would do on times of pain. But Alas! I see him hiding and sneaking like a coward from place to place. The pianist was found to survive and worry about food more than thinking anything heroic. There is a dialog ""You are great pianist in Poland and in the world"" but there were not enough scenes to emphasize and give impact. The director could have deleted couple of scenes on this instead of showing his hunger.
Although survival is more important, the Pianist getting help from others and on emergency - did not get any sympathy - but conveyed selfishness. It is true that as a single man you cannot fight the mass but there is nothing to convey that he even felt that.
I could not find any great performance by Adrien to win an Oscar. Mediocre acting. But he playing the piano before the German needs appreciation. It is unfortunate that the excellent performance of the Pianist is shown along with the end titles. Thank God I watched in the DVD version so could enjoy - not sure if I would have had the opportunity or patience to watch this in theatre.
The movie is boring at times as there is no fight back. Nor one gets motivated. I have not read the actual story but the challenge of converting an autobiography to a movie failed partially.
You cannot compare with the epic movie - ""Schindler's List"". I recommend ""Life is beautiful"" more than this.",1066694400,7,1778,4.473846153846154
1480379,4,B00005JLT5,"A film that could be watched together with Schindler's List, or Annie Frank so that we could have a full picture of the darkest holocust so real and so vivid...
There is a lot of justification for Polanski to win an Oscar as the best director and likewise, for the film to win the Gold Palm Award.  The acting of Szpilman was good too; but as to whether he deserved an Oscar turned on how well the other nominated films that year were and who the judges were etc. But that doesn't matter too much in any event.
As a piano music lover, I'm neither disappointed nor too gratified: there aren't a lot of piano music anyway. To be exact, there was only one Beethoven sonata in any event and the playing was nothing as exciting as ""Song Without End"" where the actual pianist was Bolet.
However, an average viewer should be able to find the the music appealing enough and should be able to finish the whole film in one breath rather impressed, or even stunned. Recommended.",1066348800,,967,4.432584269662922
1480380,4,B00005JLT5,"I admire Polanski for taking a broader look at the Holocaust, showing the divisions within the Jewish community in Warsaw and the help some got through the Polish underground.  Of course, it helps to have such a compelling figure as Szpilman to wrap this complex story around.
One gets a very strong impression of the devolution of Jewish life in Warsaw, as Szpilman's family is forced to reduce itself to increasingly more appalling conditions. Polanski takes in a large panoply of characters, showing just how difficult the situation was for all those involved.  The Germans are by and large faceless officers who carry out random killings.  The Warsaw Uprising is touched upon.  Szpilman seemed to have an angel on his shoulder, able to keep one step ahead of the Germans.
The situations are tense and unsettling but the film is perhaps a little too clean in terms of depictions and gives a little too glossy and account of the horrors of war.  Adrien Brody turns in a fine performance.  He seems to capture Szpilman's early disillusion and eventual degradation through the course of the war. Szpilman was a survivor, which contrasted sharply to the nihilistic views of his brother.",1066089600,4,1185,4.9296482412060305
1480381,5,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist is a unique and beautiful film in that it tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman without marring the truth with pretense or bravado. The film, as a whole, presents a vision of world war 2 Poland that was painstakingly crafted as to give the viewer an idea of the chaos, cruelty, and reality that was the backdrop for the life of the protagonist. The plot is essentialy about the survival of Szpilman as Nazi Germany invaded his homeland, sending his family to concentration and labor camps to die. The cinematography is an achievement in itself and the film is historically accurate, in one scene even showing a Nazi cameraman filming the proceedings as the Nazis truly kept thorough records.  This film does not hide the ungodly practices that were Nazi doctrine, and throughout the film, we see the arbitrary brutality that was the fate of so many polish citizens. A young woman is shot in the forehead when she asks what soldiers intend to do with their prisoners and a young boy is beaten to death trying to escape a prison wall, a scene that diector polanski lived through when he escaped nazi occupied Poland through a wall. However, because Wladyslaw Szpilman is a great artist , and more importantly, because he is very lucky, he manages to escape this ill-fates of his family members. It is through this journey that we become aquainted with the other characters in the film. These characters form the incredible depth of the film. The Polish people as a whole are not made out to be saintly patriots,one dimensional sufferers, or the subhuman manifestaion of Nazi theories. They are more accurately sculpted as human beings with weaknesses and strengths, and their own dark sides. Wladyslaw Szpilman's family represents a side of Poland that was intellegent and artistic, with strong and cohesive families, the embodiment of what so many of us strive for. For them, we feel sympathy. Their loss is truly tragic, because their fall is so great. They are not without their imperfections though, and this is  shown succinctly when Wladyslaw's brother lets his sister know that he ,"" Wished I could have known you better..."" before being sent to a camp. Also depicted, are characters who would steal a guandis and dying musician's money for survial, a below average intellegence propaghandist newspaper distibutor and prisoners who fight old women for food. On the other hand, we are not introduced to many Germans on an intimate level. The soldiers who are represented are usually brutal and murderous, fufilling the grand design of the Nazi plan. From soldiers, this behavior was solicited and required, but we also encounter a nasty german woman who would have the protagonist shot for being Jewish. This seems to suggest an evil nature of the society as a whole... until Wladyslaw meets a german officer who saves his life. The scene of their meeting is particularily striking and beautiful. Up until this point we have really only seen Wladyslaw Szpilman reacting to the chaos around him. Here he is confronted by the officer with the question of ""who are you"". Wladyslaw explains that he is a Pianist, but then stutters and stops..."" I was a Pianist"". And this is the state to which he has been reduced. He is no longer an artist. He is no longer human, nand does not look more alive than dead. He has been stripped of his humanity completely, and thus of his identity as THE PIANIST. But instead of killing him, the soldier asks him to play, and so is the character revealed to us. He is revelaed by his music, and while he plays, the officer listens, overwhelmed by the identity that Wladyslaw has recovered.",1065571200,14,3633,4.8112

If I said that ""The Pianist"" was BAD, I'm sure I would be labeled a Nazi sympathizer and be sent to a leper colony somewhere in Luxembourg. Now, let me get another thing out of the way and say that ""The Pianist"" isn't really a very good movie, either. Yes, Adrien Brody delivers a good performance in the film, and the cinematography adequately captures the violent environment that was Poland in the early 1940's. Now, let's talk about some things that ""The Pianist"" DOESN'T do, such as presenting anything new or relevant to the pursuit of portraying the Holocaust in film. I'm not sure why more people didn't see this, but ""The Pianist"" follows the typical NBC movie-of-the-week Holocaust format almost to a T: happy Jewish family enjoys life, happy Jewish family hears about the war, happy Jewish family begins to suffer discrimination, happy Jewish family gets pushed out, happy Jewish family gets sent to camp, one gets left behind, rest of movie follows him. I think I might have seen something like this on ""Lifetime"" a couple of weeks ago. Now, is it a CRIME that Roman Polanski chose to be so completely ordinary in his rendering of the Holocaust (even though he went through it himself and could have really brought some needed emotional depth to the film, one thing it lacks badly)? Not really. His film isn't hurting anyone by being the complete antithesis of something fresh and important such as ""Schindler's List."" What happens to ""The Pianist"" in its prodding, typical narrative, is that it becomes simply an ""Okay"" movie, something that a person as talented as Polanski shouldn't create. The Holocaust DID happen and has been etched in time, but movies have done a fantastic job of rendering historical events in a fashion that brings new light to them. ""Schindler's List"" was so groundbreaking because it was spare, raw, and mainly from a Nazi's perspective. ""The Pianist"" may be well-made, but that doesn't mean it's great by any means. It's a book of Holocaust cliches poured into a grossly overlong film. There is a touchy ground that is broached when it comes to critiquing a film about such an important time in world history - one that demeans a Holocaust film looks unpatriotic, or unsympathetic. I'm simply rating a film here, and Holocaust-or-not, ""The Pianist"" is hopelessly ordinary and didn't deserve any of the three Academy Awards it received.",1064966400,9,2495,4.818181818181818

1480385,5,B00005JLT5,"I love the cinema of Roman Polanksi,ever since I watched a lonely, paranoid and frustrated Catherine Deneuve's descent into madness in his masterpiece Repulsion. In fact Polanski's films were one of the first I ever watched and thanks to them that I came to appreciate cinema as much more than mere entertainment, but an art form of the most sophisticated kind.
He is truly one of the last directors/auteurs in cinema today,whose life,background and personal vision often collide with his fiction,to give us a unique blend and classic films.
The Pianist is certainly his best film since since Chinatown,an EXTREMELY well directed movie,and of course it is his most personal.
Interestingly enough,Polanksi has never approached on celluloid the subject of his identity/background as a Pole/East European on one hand, and his Jewish heritage and the suffering he experienced from the Nazis as a result on the other,(both his parents were sent to concentration camps, only his father survived the ordeal)..Until now that is.
Adapting Wladyslaw Szpilman's own book about his experiences,hardships he faced and survival in the polish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland,it is also true of Polanski's own experiences..He too had to flee the Nazis and learned how to survive. Although the film touches greatly on the suffering of the Polish Jews under the Nazis,(with harrowing images of cold brutality),it is a more personal story about survival,seen exclusively through the eyes of the gifted pianist(and indirectly Polanski's too).All the events that unfold during and up to the end of the war revolves around his perception and condition.
The process of one man's survival against impossible odds that never diminished his love of music,the hunger that never clashed with his sense of humanity..This is really  what the Pianist is about, and this is what makes it a fine film.
There are many haunting images and unforgettable scenes in the Pianist, but the one I most vividly remember is when Szpilman plays a beautiful Chopin ballad for the first time in years for the German officer,hesitant and confused at first but then totally immersed in the music as if  transported into another universe, an energy suddenly bursting that does not fail to impress the officer who saves his life.
This was an extremely powerful scene!
Throughout his career Polanski has chosen his actors well, so naturally it was an inspired choice to cast the wonderful Adrien Brody for the lead role,earning him a well deserved Oscar.
Polanksi in the Pianist has for the first time faced his own past and background, and in a way also exorcised his own demons as much as Wladyslaw Szpilman did in his book,two men who have suffered greatly,two artists who share a common love for their craft: one never leaving Warsaw, the other returning years after to tell the story of the Pianist, and his own too..",1064448000,2,2882,5.078059071729958

The major difference between this and Spielberg's gem is that ""Schindler's List"" is more objective, and ""The Pianist"" is subjective.  In this film a rapport develops with Szpilman and you see the horror through his tired eyes. The direction is astounding, and I pity anyone who did not see this on the big screen. There are many shocking scenes, most of which happen so fast that they are indigestible before the next horrifiying sequence.  This may leave some people feeling cold, but the technical filmaking in this movie is superb.  Roman Polanski richly deserved the Oscar for Best Director. This is a moving film with many unnerving scenes that linger long after the lights have come up.",1064448000,,812,4.905109489051095
1480407,4,B00005JLT5,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is a hard film for me to review, because it was a hard film to watch. I am an admirer of Polanski, and have watched everthing he's made---right down to ""The Fearless Vampire Killers""---scores of times. I approached ""The Pianist"" with a combination of intrigue and ambivalence: on the one hand, doubtless I would get a hearty serving of Holocaust horror and grue, which I wasn't looking forward to. On the other hand, Polanski is a master filmmaker at the height of his craft, and if he had a story to tell about the Nazi occupation of Poland, I wanted to hear it.
I wasn't expecting this.
""The Pianist"" is not a normal film; it is certainly not a normal ""Holocaust film"", if there is even such a thing. And contrary to the way the film was marketed, it is not a story of hope, of redemption amidst the ruins, of a ray of light in humanity's darkness. Not at all.
This is a story of stupid, brute, hard-scrabble survival. The fact that it is set in 1939 Warsaw is almost incidental, in that the character of Wladyslaw Szpilman (played masterfully by Adrien Brody) could as easily have been stranded on a desert island, crashed in the snowy heights of the Andes, or buried in the bowels of some Stygian cave.
So viewer beware: this is not a hopeful tale, this is a brutal, harrowing, horrifying first-person journey told entirely from the viewpoint of its eponymous protagonist. And from the moment we encounter the pianist playing Chopin for the Polish state radio, until the closing credits, the camera literally never leaves his side.
With that in mind, ""The Pianist"" is the story of a young Jewish man's struggle to survive as the Nazi darkness falls across Poland. The story is set, and takes place entirely, in Warsaw, begins with the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 (with a shell literally crashing into the Pianist's formerly serene world), and culminates in the ""liberation"" of the city by the Soviet Red Army in 1945.
The sequences are terse, starkly filmed, often brutal, and mercilessly chronological: Szpilman's family, along with the other Jewish citizens of Warsaw, is quickly humiliated and segregated. One by one come the cold Nazi dictums: no Jews in the parks, no Jews in cafes, no Jews sitting on public benches, all Jews must wear self-made Stars of David on the right arm of their clothing. Ultimately Szpilman's family is moved to the Warsaw ghetto, and things quickly go downhill from there.
When the credits rolled, I was stunned, I was utterly in shock. I recall the initial line of ""Moby Dick"" from Melville: ""And I alone escaped to tell thee."" That, for me, is ""The Pianist."" Szpilman is nothing more than a brute survivor, his humanity is reduced by degrees, as before our horrified eyes he begins to die a death of a thousand cuts. And that, I think, explains why this movie was so maddening for me, and at times so repulsive.
It's hard to identify with Szpilman, this man who trades everything for survival, for the ability to once again play Chopin on his beloved ivories (and boy does he get his chance!). Adrien Brody here is truly masterful: I completely forgot that I was watching an actor on a screen play a role, and became completely absorbed in the character. It is an amazing role, but also a creepily unattractive one: Szpilman is no hero. The heroes in this movie get shot, burned, executed with no quarter and no mourners. Indeed, I became increasingly frustrated with this strangest of protagonists, who is both massively lucky and massively foolish; those familiar with the sequences where Szpilman fumbles with dishware and ambles out to Russian rescuers will understand what I'm talking about here.
Szpilman, meanwhile, survives---but there is a catch to his survival, and in it I think Polanski provides an antidote to an otherwise mesmerizing but nihilistic film that seems to whisper about the silence of God in a blindly uncaring, insane universe. And even more remarkably, despite my initial loathing for the character---my God, man, grab a rifle and get revenge!---I began to care very deeply for him.
Polanski makes a bold decision in attaching the camera solely to Szpilman, and it is a gambit that pays off handsomely. Szpilman becomes our eyes on this brutal, searingly horrific world; his ears are our ears, and we flinch when he fumbles with a cabinet and brings a cupboard full of china crashing down on the floor of his hiding place. Polanski has worked seamlessly with Director of Photography Pawel Edelman to create a totally authentic nightmare world which becomes unbearably horrible---and then, without flinching, spirals down into even more unimaginable horror.
The acting here is all first-rate. Particularly surprising is the excellent work by Thomas Kretschmann (an elegant German actor with fine poise who appeared, amazingly, as the Vampire overlord Damaskinos in Blade II), who portrays a German officer who---no, I'll let you see for yourself. In a sense, Kretschmann's character serves as the mirror image of the pianist, and puts a fine coda to the film. And while the film features the most haunting piano works of Beethoven and Chopin, composer Wojciech Kilar (who produced the astounding soundtrack to Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"") returns with a haunting, moving score that serves the movie well.
I am not finished with ""The Pianist."" It was not an easy film to watch; indeed, it was often repulsive and maddening, and yet I imagine I'll be watching it again. If you find yourself reacting in the same way to the film, if you're tempted to turn it off---resist!---stay with it: you'll be richly rewarded. It is a bold film, a masterful movie, and a film which I contend again is not strictly a Holocaust piece: it is about survival, and centers on the question of how much of himself a man is willing to surrender in order to survive---and after the surrender, what remains of the man? What makes him human?
One question continues to trouble me, though: is Szpilman changed after his ordeal? Is he a different man---or is he the same? Did he change, after all?",1064361600,30,6069,4.825335892514396
1480408,4,B00005JLT5,"The uniqueness of this movie stems from the fact that the leading actor is not leading anything.
There is no escape from the feelings the common viewer senses as he watches the film - there is no ordinary protagonist in here. Adrien Brody, as Wladyslaw Szpilman, is actually portraying the character of an everyday person - that in the face of grave danger wants only to stay alive and is not interested in fighting back and probably dying in the process.
In many previous films the crowd has come to expect tales of bravery, boldness and selfishness that give rise to sublimity of the spirit and a far-reaching emotions of human bond.
This motion picture turns things the other way around; Szpilman is not really the hero. The real heroes are the people who take tremendous risks and help him to survive the incomprehensible and inconceivable ordeal of The Holocaust. Starting with the Jewish Capos, continuing with a few Polish friends and ending with a high rank SS officer; they are all persons that rise up beyond the mere circumstances and imminent danger, reach out and help a friend - or a total stranger.
The importance of this film is the return to the notion that even among the most ferocious wickedness - goodness still exists - even if in small quantities.

Great and very talented director Roman Polanski who for the second time in his career went in the undermined world to make a point, to tell the real story which have been told before.
Nazi march thru Poland, placed Jews in Ghettos and than shipped them to concentrating camps. To burn them, to gas them, to kill them.  Wladyslaw Szpilman ( best role by Adrien Brody ) was lucky to get away and hide to survive. Five stars! A million Oscars! No! Why?
 After first 30 minutes of the film, I lost any interest in main character. Even Polanski admitted that this was not much to go with. This is not the story of someone who sacrificed something for better. It is a story of a chicken which never crossed the road. But I have to admit director's talent. The way how he showed his personal point of view on the main character: by making him watch in hiding the others, the ones who chose not to hide but to fight. The ones who didn't care about their little lives but cared about real freedom... the ones who won the war.
At the end the story of the German officer got my attention but it died without deep look into it.
I would of give this fine film A- grade, but I watched not well known ""The Truce"" few month before ""The Pianist"" came out. Compare to that film? Solid 4 stars, not an inch more.

I've always been a sucker for things having to do with the ghettos during WW2 and this movie immediately appealed to me on that level, but what left me speechless was Adrien Brody's performance.
I've been a fan of his for years, but his performance in this movie was without a doubt his best.  He captured the spirit of Wladyslaw Szpilman and I admire the lengths he was willing to go to in order to experience what Szpilman experienced in terms of isolation and starvation.
This movie affected me in a way I never expected it to.  There were moments when I completely forgot that this was a true story and that Szpilman survived. To be honest, I was screaming for him to hurry up and run out of the room when the Germans were blow-torching the buildings.  My heart broke on a few occasions with this movie, but the scene that got to me the most was when he told his sister that he wished he knew her better.
Roman Polanski has created his masterpiece.  I'll admit, the movie does drag on in some scenes, but overall, this was a story about one mans will to survive. Afterall, survival was Szpilman's ultimate masterpiece.
I would also recommend checking out the book the movie is based on.  This is a rare instance where I found the movie to be better, but it is a worthy read.

1480414,5,B00005JLT5,"I am a history buff. I will admit that up front, so when I heard they were making a movie about the Warsaw Ghetto during WW2 I nearly jumped out of my seat. The movie begins with Adrien Brody playing the piano. Right then you are rivited, because it is awesome. If you are familiar with the story of the Warsaw ghetto, you would know that the Germans came into Poland, and literally walled up the city, and housed 500,000 people in hellish conditions. Throughout the movie, you see Brody's charatcter endure horrible things at the hands of the Germans, all the while you know that he is one of the greatest pianists in history. After spending almost the whole war in running from the Germans and the concentration camps, near the end of the movie, while hiding in a house, Brody's character befriends a German officer who takes pity on him and brings him food and other amenities. After the war ends, he continues playing the piano on a grand scale, and lives all the way until his death a few years ago in 2000. What makes this story so great is that it is true, it really happened. All the way through the story, you watch and think ""this really happened to someone."" It is a very sobering experience to watch this movie. If anyone has seen Schindler's List, you will understand. I strongly recommend this movie to people who want to appreciate the efforts of people involved in WW2.",1060214400,2,1385,4.5
1480445,5,B00005JLT5,"Director Roman Polanski had much personal history to draw on, when he directed ""The Pianist."" He spent his own childhood in Poland, and escaped from the Krakow Ghetto, although his mother, and other family members, perished in the Holocaust. Polanski makes this his most personal and powerful film to date, and deservingly won the Academy Award Oscar for Best Director.
""The Pianist"" is the agonizing story of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's survival of the Nazi's destruction of Polish Jewry. The film begins in 1939, with Szpilman playing Chopin on the piano for Radio Warsaw, as the Germans bomb the city, and finally force him to stop playing. History has documented well what happened in Warsaw over the following two years - the Jewish ghetto was constructed and settled, racial laws were written and enforced, people died of starvation, illness, or Nazi murder. Then the ""resettlement"" roundups began. Szpilman was waiting at the Umshagplatz to be deported to Treblinka, with his family, when fate seemingly intervened, and he was spared. His survival story is a different kind of hell than others that I have seen or read about. Szpilman watches the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, and subsequent destruction, from the outside, looking in. Usually, accounts of the Jewish uprising are from former fighters, or survivors, who were inside the ghetto at the time. I can only wonder if Szpilman longed to join his fellow Jews and fight the Nazis, rather than remain in his solitary apartment overlooking the ghetto, with his own end unknown.
The story is told from a uniquely unsentimental point of view. I felt at times that Szpilman, brilliantly portrayed by Adrien Brody, had distanced himself from all emotion, except for the periods when he played the piano in his imagination, and listened to music in his head. Perhaps this detachment was the mechanism that allowed him to survive emotionally.
The well-written screenplay, by Ronald Harwood, was adapted from Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoirs published in 1946. During some of the movie's most emotional parts, there are amazing camera shots of snow falling, or leaves blowing across an empty street, or the snow covered ghetto ruins that look like the end of the world, with the only sound - Chopin's piano music. These film takes add emotion to the film, compensate for, and contrast well with Szpilman's emotional isolation.
There is a haunting scene, near the film's end, with Szpilman and a German officer, that still moves me to tears when I think about it.
The film is a remarkable in its sensitivity, and portrayal of one man's struggle to survive.  I highly recommend it.",1059868800,3,2632,5.064516129032258
1480446,5,B00005JLT5,"There have been many movies made about the holocaust.  What does this movie add to what has already been said about the holocaust?  In my opinion, many such movies understandably and justifiably emphasize realism and factual represention of events.  Unfortunately, many directors do not have the skill to realistically depict hope under such circumstances.  For example, Spielberg's Schindler's List resorts to rather sophomoric narrative devices in its depiction of hope in the face of adversity.  When the list is first generated, we see Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley desperately thinking of name after name of people to save.  There is a build-up that felt like a scene in the locker room of the underdog team before the big game, or the ""you can do it"" speeches given to someone who's failed at something in the past.  It is typical Spielberg and it makes you feel like cheering Schindler on.  And, in the end, when Schindler laments he should have saved more, there is a sense of artifice and overdramatization.  This was not the holocaust.  There was no cheering and overdramatization.  People were scared for their lives, alone, focused on self-preservation, acting in secrecy and desparation.  The mood of Schindler's List overall was certainly sad and the scenes ""realistic"", but I felt that Spielberg oversimplified and overdramatized the emotions and some events in order to emphasize hope.  It is this over-emphasis of hope that undermines Schindler's List, because it feels forced.  In The Pianist, no such simplification occurs.  This is an uncomprising, unflinching view of terrible events in one man's life that sustains hope for survival without phony plot devices and oversimplification.  It is somewhat documentary in style, without very much dialogue, special effects, or forced dramatization.  The events unfold simply, without artifice, and without prejudice.  If Spilzman died it would seem natural and expected given his circumstances.  The fact that he survives is exhilirating. This holocaust movie reveals the goodness in human nature in the face of the most terrible atrocities realistically and without compromise.  That has not been achieved in past holocaust movies very often or very succesfully..

1480447,5,B00005JLT5,"Forget the Oscars. Forget the Golden Globes. The Pianist WAS the best film of 2002, no doubt about it. A great movie is supposed to make you feel all sorts of emotions, make you experience things you'd never thought you'd experience. The Pianist does that an more.
The fact that the movie is a hard one to watch probably didn't play well with award voters last year. There isn't much happiness in this tale of WW2 war prisoners and concentration camps. But Brody embodies his character so well - a young Polish pianist who has nothing to live for now that that war has started and who's only way to stay sane is by playing piano in his mind - that he more than deserved the acolades he received for this role.
With this film, you almost feel as though you are living one of the darkest pages of history. Director Roman Polanski brings you back to a time of death and sadness and makes you feel all of these emotions as if you were there in person. There are not many films that can make you feel such a strong slew of emotions.
The Pianist is a film that will go down in history. It will still be remembered - and celebrated - fifty years from now. It is truly one of the best, and most affecting, films about the holocaust.",1059523200,3,1224,4.280172413793103

However, as it rolled on in the theatre I found myself ticking off when the ghetto uprising would start, when the deportations would start, when the russians would start, and realized that, inspite of it being an absolutely horrific period in history, the pacing of this movie is way too familiar. For me it di not have the heartbreaking drama of Schindler's story, and in fact seemed too often to too closely mirror it.
I was not aware that this was a true story (I tend to live under a rock), so I thought some of what this poor man goes through to be incredulous, and when it looked like he might be shot at the end by mistake, I presumed it was just another manifestation of Polanski's sick imagination. Finding out that it was true did not move me any closer to the heart of the story. See for yourself. As a film, it has undeniable strong points technically. As a story, I just kept thinking that this was redundantly Schindler.",1059523200,2,1028,4.41578947368421
1480449,5,B00005JLT5,"Not since ""Shindler's List (1993) has such a poignant tale of Holocaust survival been brought to the screen. The team of Roman Polanski (Director) and Ronald Howard (screenplay) have faithfully adapted Wladyslaw Szpilman's touching memoir to produce one of the most realistic human dramas in recent years. Polanski's own recollections of his childhood spent in the Cracow ghetto are added to Howard's screenplay. The result is a brilliant and artistic testimony to the human spirit's will to survive. Adrien Brody plays Szpilman, an accomplished pianist from a well-to-do Jewish family in Warsaw. He is playing over the Polish radio station when the Nazis conquer the city in September 1939. Forcefully moved into the Warsaw Ghetto, Szpilman is spared the fate of his family who are loaded into cattle cars and ""relocated"" to the concentration camp at Treblinka. With the help of others, Szpilman escapes the ghetto and goes into hiding. He is hidden by a close knit group of Polish gentiles who risk certain death if they are caught. Szpilman is nearly starved to death while locked in a flat when a shady accomplice sells Szpilman's food ration on the black market. Szpilman watches helplessly from his perch while the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is quelched and the city turned into a smoldering ruin. Forced to live the existence of a rat, burrowing through the gutted city in search of food, Szpilman is saved by Hauptmann (Captain) Wilm Hosenfeld, like Schindler, a good German. Ironically, Szpilman is nearly shot by the Russians at war's end because he is wearing the officer's great coat Hosenfeld had given him to keep warm. The human will to survive in the most horrible circumstances is the film's central theme. The ability to keep one's humanity and moral integrity under such conditions was the true test for Szpilman. It was his love of music, that flowed through his veins when nutrients could not that saved his soul from crumbling like the city walls around him. Besides the horrible atrocities committed by the Nazis, Polanski displays the darker side of non-Germans as well. The Jewish police and Polish Militia, who brutally beat Jews and herded them onto awaiting transports are accurately portrayed. With the exception of one neighbor who tries unsuccessfully to turn Szpilman into the Nazis, all the other Polish gentiles depicted in the film are sympathetic to the Warsaw Jews. Anti-Semitism was equally as rampant a problem in Poland as in the rest of Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. Perhaps Polanski was trying to remain loyal to Szpilman's perspective, but a stronger dose of Polish anti-Semitism would have seemed more believable. On the whole, The Pianist is a wonderful film. The set design and wardrobe are authentic down to the finest detail. Every scene is a gem. The acting job by Brody and supporting cast are superb and the soundtrack hauntingly beautiful. The DVD's behind the scenes extras are a fine tribute to Polanski's artistry. I rented this DVD, now I have to own it. Five stars and highly recommended.",1059436800,2,3062,5.017681728880157

At first the restrictions placed on Szpilman and his family don't seem so bad, but as time goes on they are forced to move into the Jewish ghetto, where they are eventually loaded onto a train bound for one of the concentration camps.  As Szpilman is waiting to board the train with his family, however, he is pulled from the crowd by one of the ghetto police, Jews who are working for the German officers in hopes of better treatment, and told to run away.  From that point on his life becomes a struggle for survival, working for the Germans until they liquidate the ghetto, then being smuggled from one safe house to another until he is finally discovered in the bombed-out ruins of a flat by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, a German officer who is so moved by Szpilman's music that he decides to keep the secret of the pianist's survival until the Germans retreat from the city.
Adrien Brody played the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman with great sensitivity, showing Szpilman to be a man of deep feeling who is witnessing the horrors of the war all around him, but doing what he must to survive.  Adrien Brody was able to make the character of Szpilman so believable and human that I found myself near tears several times during the course of the movie.  Thomas Kretschmann was also very good as Capt. Hosenfeld, the young German officer who provides aid and comfort to Szpilman after hearing him play the piano.  While I was watching this particular scene I could actually see Hosenfeld being torn between his duty to his Motherland and doing what he knew to be right as a human being, and Kretschmann played it just right.

The main problem with this film is that, like car chases and graphic violence, the subject has been revisited so often that very few movies break any new ground. We see the refugee, Wladyslaw Szpilman, reduced from cavalier indifference to a desparate effort to survive. A number of people help him, feed him, hide him, including a German officer. Alas, he seems focused only on saving his own skin. We watch with him as Jewish partisans fight the Germans in a lopsided match; we see Polish citizens risking their lives to hide Jewish refugees. Unlike ""Schindler's List"" or ""The Garden of the Finzi Contini's"", there seems to be no message beyond ""Look what horrible things happened to these people"" -- not a startling revelation to most movie-goers. The movie is well-made, though a bit long. Be warned, the 'R' is for a little off-color language and a LOT of graphic violence.

1480454,5,B00005JLT5,"Hollywood [Bad]! I have just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece, a film that is about characters and events, that's lyrical and beautiful and all I can think of after it is how much of a tool Tom Hanks is. Why is it that after experiencing Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST I can only think of Robert Zemeckis's CAST AWAY? It's a really an eerie feeling, but go with me for a little while. Maybe my ranting will begin to make sense.
THE PIANIST is the powerful and lyrical life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody, Summer of Sam), a Jew living in Poland during World War II. It follows him from a peaceful life as a piano player on polish radio, to the ghetto's of Warsaw, to hiding in empty apartments, and all the while dreaming of life as it once was. CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks, The Money Pit) a FedEx employee that gets trapped on a deserted island and in the end talks to volleyball.
How are these two stories similar? They're both about men trying to make through unbelievable circumstances and how they must do it alone. One takes the Hollywood approach, where everything is ambiguously tied up at the end. The other takes a more lyrical approach, where a man returns to what he does best. The Pianist takes the lyrical approach and in the end is more successful a story.
Brody is fantastic. For much of the film he's teetering on that thin line between madness and sanity. Nothing more telling than the scene, in which, Szpilman, whom hasn't eaten in days, finds an unopened jar of pickles. In his attempt to open that jar he is confronted by his worst fear, a German guard standing before him. In a Hollywood film, this scene would be about Szpilman breaking free and running away. But in the PIANST it about him longing for that can of pickles. When he picks it up off the floor he holds onto it for dear life. If his life is not taken by the guard he's got to eat so he's not letting go. It's a small moment that is really powerful.
I contrast that with Tom Hanks teetering on that thin line as well. He has a friend, he talks to a volleyball. But this relationship is far different. This relationship is about giving the actor something to talk to. The most dramatic moment in this film is when he losses the Volleyball. Problem is the film suggests that the volleyball is a character and not a need, like food. This moment is so huge it spoils what should be a moment of discovery for the character. The moment when he can go on without his crutch, but all the audience cares about is a stupid volleyball.
The final moments in THE PIANIST are also small but have strong impact. Moments before the credits roll we see Szpilmann sitting in an open field, wondering what to do next. It then cuts to him doing what he's always done. He's beaten those who have tried to keep him down. It's encouraging but the music doesn't have to swell, and the violins don't have to play. It's a small intimate moment. The scene does not force emotion, but there is much there. It plays with life the way life really is, when the battle is over, we may have changed but we still sometimes go back to what we are good at. He one tha battle and he can play again.
CASTAWAY puts the hero right in the middle of a literal crossroads. What should he do next? The camera circles around him, and he walks down a road. But while Both moments are very similar, this moment is over sentimental. It forces emotions and it fails to move you, you don't really care what road he choses. It kind of diminishes his battle. He has nowhere to go and I'm sure none of us want to follow.
In film sometimes plot is inconsequential. I would have loved to have been trapped on an island with Wladyslaw Szpilman as much as I didn't care about Chuck Noland on an island, and well he'd probably wind up gassed in a polish concentration camp had he come up in that time. That's what is great about Brody's performance, he is in every scene of this movie, and fills the screen with a character of depth and strength. Hanks fills the screen with a character of no depth and mostly surface strength.
It's amazing that I could compare two completely opposite films and explain how one fails and the other one works. But I have found a new film I can call a favorite and another film I can never rent again. One is powerful, the other dull and yet they have two characters that can be very similar.
Do yourself a favor and rent THE PIANST, you won't be disappointed.",1059004800,3,4451,4.370325693606755
1480475,5,B00005JLT5,"The New York Times recently published an article that hypothetically asked if there were too many recent documentary and feature films made about the Holocaust.  The answer was an obvious no, but it does stand to reason that films about the Holocaust have become a genre that is all their own.  And, like any genre, there are good movies and lousy ones.  The Holocaust itself is such an emotionally loaded subject that it's difficult to dismiss any material based on it.  And that's why there is a perceived glut of Holocaust movies out, because all of them are taken seriously (except maybe ""Jakob the Liar"").
The Holocaust remains a fascinating subject for the simple reason that it happened.  It is, along with slavery, the darkest chapter of recent human history, and it cannot be undone.  It cannot be reversed.  There is a finality to the events that remains terribly difficult to deal with, and it's what ultimately makes Roman Polanski's The Pianist such a devastating experience.
It's curious that Polanski, who is himself a survivor of the Holocaust (he lost all but one member of his immediate family when he was just a boy), would fashion the Pianist as such an unsparing and unsentimental look at what happened to Polish Jews during World War II.  Then again, it makes perfect sense.  Polanski knows what an unforgiving time that was, and he refuses to sugarcoat it.  Not that a movie like Schindler's List wrongfully dabbled in adding extra melodrama to the era, but The Pianist is important because it seems to get the true emotions of its characters just right.  You feel like the story happened exactly this way in real life.  Polanski also filters the story solely through the point-of-view of Wladislaw Szpilman (played by Adrien Brody, whose portrayal merits adulation beyond the Oscar he has already received).  He does not try and make Szpilman's story a microcosm of every Jew's story.  Nor does he try and make Szpilman an overly herioc figure.  He is simply a normal man who miraculously survives and cannot explain why.
The fact that Szpilman survives the Holocaust makes The Pianist riveting as a story, but the idea that he had to do it in such complete and total isolation (the latter portion of the film plays almost like the movie Cast Away) is what makes it doubly powerful.  If this is what Szpilman had to endure in order to survive, imagine what others had to go through.  And is it a better fate to survive such atrocities rather than perish?  Polanski provides no answer, and that's why the film unsettled many who saw it.
It would be foolish in discussing The Pianist and its accolades to not acknowledge the controversy surrounding Polanski himself.  Regardless of people's opinion of Polanski (and it can range from admiration to disgust, sometimes from the same person), The Pianist stands alone as an important work of art.  And, the fact that Hollywood actually gave Polanski an Oscar in absentia for the movie speaks more to its undeniable power than it does any kind of perceived liberal favoritism (though there's plenty of that to go around in the film industry).  Polanski clearly saw a parallel between his childhood memories and the story of Szpilman, and it shows all over the movie.  It makes The Pianist his own, but not in any kind of self-indulgent manner.
Polanski also saw something in Brody that must have reminded him of himself.  Brody, who had gone relatively unnoticed despite his wealth of talent, here gives a performance so complete it's hard to imagine that he is in real life just a kid from Brooklyn.  Thanks to Brody, some portions of the movie that could come off as contrived (in particular the piano-playing scene in a destroyed Warsaw ghetto), instead feel real and are completely heartbreaking.  Other actors are effective here, but Brody is the film, and the job he does is nothing short of amazing.
Roger Ebert has said numerous times that no good film is depressing.  I disagree with that (you won't be partying after watching Schindler's List).  But great, emotionally difficult films like The Pianist are far too rewarding to avoid.  It is easily the best film of last year, and perhaps the best dramatized Holocaust film ever made.  Art like this makes the words ""Never Forget"" a whole lot easier to remember.",1058918400,4,4289,4.829001367989056
1480476,5,B00005JLT5,"Like Dracula, World War II is probably one of the most filmed eras. You have Oskar Schindler's saving the Jews in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, and the Invasion of Normandy in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Here, Roman Polanski directs a story that takes place throughout World War II through the eyes of a Polish man and his love for the piano.
The story begins as Wladyslaw Spilzman, a pianist is living through augmenting worse conditions. He then is forced to hide through the ruins of Warsaw, until his rescue from the ruins by a kind hearted German officer. Through dealing with famine, tragedy and death, he manages to get through it by his wanting to play the piano, even in his mind. In one scene, he imagines playing the piano notes in his head without actually playing for fear of Germans overhearing.
In today's era of overblown movies without substance like Legally Blonde or really expensive but good films like Matrix Reloaded, it's about time a film came out of Hollywood with a gripping story and human characters, rather than a big green Shrek reject.",1058745600,2,1137,4.835897435897436
1480477,5,B00005JLT5,"One of the most magical aspects of movie making can be found in the rare occasion when such a dramatization of a best-selling book results in an equally spellbinding film.  Of course, the fact that it was Academy Award winning director Roman Polanski chosen to direct the project was a critical choice in bringing this shattering story of a man who found his humanity in classical music even in the midst of the Nazi takeover of Poland during World War Two to the screen. Given Mr. Polanski's personal experience as a Holocaust survivor, he has an exceptionally well-hewn capability to recreate all the sights, sounds, and sensibilities of the times to the movie with loving accuracy. In so doing he has created a modern masterpiece along the lines of such similar treatments of the period as Stephen Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"".
Yet, while Spielberg apparently was striving to paint a broader-brushed treatment of the period and the horrific excesses of the Nazi treatment of the indigenous Jewish population during the war, Polanski concentrates much more exclusively on the personal journey of a solitary human being, in this case a pianist so singularly focused on his art and its centrality to his existence that he is often almost schizophrenic in his ability to ignore or block out all the mayhem, chaos and destruction that surrounds his every move.  Against such a backdrop of the momentous events transpiring from the German army's invasion of Poland in September of 1939 through the end of the war is the pianist's story so marvelously told. His survival through the most barbaric of conditions imaginable is a testament both to his good luck and his hardy strength of will to survive for the sake of his blessed classical music.
Young actor Adrian Brody, in an Academy Award winning performance, both accurately and amazingly portrays the almost unbelievable events experienced by author/pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman as he makes his tortured way through the brutal gauntlet of the Nazi killing machine bent on the systematic extermination through the combined strategies of enforced work regimes, slow starvation, and murder in the death camps. The protagonist survives through a combination of his own wits as well as through the unexpected and strictly forbidden assistance of others, many of whom literally risked their own safety and lives by reaching out to aid him.
 Polanski puts a human face on the Germans as well, showing at one point how in the midst of the unspeakable horror many of his colleagues were visiting on the Polish Jews and gypsies, even an officer in the Wehrmacht could be willing to risk his own safety to assist the pianist. The cinematography is remarkable, with a superb depiction of the massive destruction that modern war brings in its wake. The overshots of a totally destroyed Warsaw is a graphic demonstration of such total devastation on a scale so unimaginable that it would be otherwise difficult to grasp either intellectually or emotionally. This is a film that belongs in any serious film fan's library, and one I can heartily recommend for all but the youngest viewers. Enjoy!",1058745600,4,3131,5.04054054054054
1480478,4,B00005JLT5,"If ever a director was born to make a specific film, it's Roman Polanski and THE PIANIST.  Winner of numerous international awards including Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, ""The Pianist"" follows the true story of Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous escape from the Warsaw Ghetto.  Epic in scope with attention to the minutest period details, the film's authenticity resonates long after it ends. Adrien Brody underplays Szpilman and we understand that his desire to again create music helped him survive. Perhaps the poets had it right when they merged Beauty and Truth and Freedom.  A significant extra is the documentary ""A Story of Survival"" in which Polanski reflects on his own horrific childhood in the Warsaw Ghetto. Clearly, every frame of ""The Pianist"" is filtered through that lens.  This is a great film of horror and hope.",1058227200,4,869,5.141843971631205

Adrien Brody rises to star status, made even more impressive by his physical deterioration and the training he undertook to improve his actual piano playing skills. His performance conveys even more with the use of his body than the words he speaks. And those words are at times poetic.

His every movement, every gesture, tone of voice, his whole demeanor held my attention without pause. The photography is that of ""Room With a View"" and ""Passage to India"". It has the historical scope and authenticity of ""Another Country"" and ""Reds"". You watch in horror that ""Humanity"" could ever sink and slither to this level.
There are few films I could watch again and again, this is one of them. Your eyes need to follow the most subtle details, the myriad textures within each scene. The widescreen version enhances even on our small television screen.

1480481,5,B00005JLT5,"This is the second movie, next to Uprising (highly recommendable too), that shows the tragic Warsaw uprising. Only, the Pianist goes beyond and tells the story of the Jewish-Polish pianist Szpilman. I was not only fascinated by the performances of the actors but - as a German - I felt sad and extremely sorry for what has happened to all those people in the name of the German people. Actually, it was hard to swallow to see a German officer walking up to some Jews, returning to the Ghetto, and randomly shooting some of them dead. It was the way it was performed that was utterly believable. This inhuman capacity that some Human beings have is shown brilliantly in this movie.
However, it is not only the Germans but also the one Polish character that supposedly helps Szpilman to survive and simply betrayes him and almost let him die. It is the human dimension that makes this movie special.
A very nice and very believable scene is placed at the end when Szpilman was saved by a German officer who eventually dies in a Soviet concentration camp. The film shows also that not all Germans were bad; something many movies end up doing: bad Germans, good Allies. However, life is not like that and there is a lot of grey in between black and white.",1058054400,2,1251,4.564444444444445
1480482,4,B00005JLT5,"The movie is bracketed with the first and last scenes the same--the pianist is playing a beautiful classical piece on Polish radio. In between the scenes is the destruction of the Warsaw Jewish community.
Partly a 'normal', if that word can ever be applied to WW2, holocaust story with the associated emotions:
how can the participants in such horror ever get their just due?
why did the Jews go as sheep to the slaughter and not fight until the end?
an emotional 'never again' and 'i'd rather die fighting'
but after all these emotions pass, as they do in the numerous other Holocaust movies this has several other things to recommend it....
first the stark graphics, several times you feel it is is black and white, strongly presented, the scenes of destruction and abandonment. street with dead and suitcases, blocks of destroyed buildings.
but the last message is the one with him in the building attic when the German officer catches him. it is a most moving depiction of the randomness, the nonsense, the inability of man to control his own destiny despite his enormous desire and struggle to do so. Not just the Jewish but the German as well. He died 7 years later in a Russian gulag camp. A victim nonetheless but a willing one cooperating in his destruction by following and working for the Nazis. but in a way as undeserving of the fate that awaited him.
Are we all victims of fate? moved by forces that mangle, destroy, crush us? the pianist is a struggling man, not a hero, but an antihero, he lives simply by dumb luck, held together by the music in his head, motivated by human needs just to survive.
the authors of the movie seem to say that the randomness overcomes all. something more must emerge from the Holocaust, something more heroic, something more struggling to do good in the midst of great evil. but this movie shows only the banality of survival.

Many times I questioned out loud how a person can do such things.  I keep hoping for the best.  Each time my wish was granted surprising me.  It was an outstanding film.  You can tell that a large amount of love was devoted from all who were involved providing the audience with one of the few perfect films.  The praise presented from critics and film institutions is warranted.  Adrien Brody has brought a new level of talent to the film industry.  He has set a standard that those in the business need to study.  Every year I watch a number of so called Academy films.  They are boring. Actors fail to impress me.  Plainly said they [stink].  Some are worse than other but you get the idea.  Great movies are to have a special aspect setting them apart from all the rest.  All the dimensions including Actors, Directors, Producers or Screen Plays should rise to the occasion.  The Pianist achieved all this and more. If you have the time look up the number of awards won by The Pianist. I get chill bumps.  Watching The Pianist is an experience I will not soon forget.  The world is so lucky to have Roman Polanski.  He is the director behind classic movies such as Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown both I recommend you rent this week. He is a genius.  To express my feeling about The Pianist is hard.

1480506,5,B00005JLT5,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is a brilliantly produced tale based on the true story of a Polish Jew whose strong will to survive carried him through the darkest days of Nazi occupation of Poland.  The acting is superlative in all the roles, from Adrian Brody's lead to lesser roles, like the well-dressed lady in the Warsaw ghetto who obsessively asks everyone, ""Have you seen my husband?"" A notable acting performance is also given in the role of the German captain who, as the Russians approach Poland, gives his overcoat to the pianist, partly out of kindness and partly to try to enlist his aid as the Germans are defeated and captured.
  The photography is superb, the attention to detail is excellent.  This is Polanski's master work.
  Although the movie is bleak throughout, with much suffering and no light relief or moments of humor, it is also suffused with hope, with endurance, with the will to survive.  One of the most moving scenes is when the pianist lifts the lid of a piano in the apartment where he hides.  He cannot play it, for the sound might alert others, but he holds his hands over the keys, fingers the air, and mentally hears the piece his hands are playing.

1480507,5,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist is a true story about a Jewish pianist in Poland during World War II who manages to survive the horrors of the Nazis.  The Jews are forced from their home and into a cramped Ghetto where there is starvation, few jobs, and horrors.  Nazis take delight in bullying the Jews.  Then, millions are Jews are forced into cramped wooden cars to go to concentration camps.
The pianist doesn't go to concentration camps, however.  He manages to stay behind, but his tortures don't end there.  He is forced to help the other Jews build the wall seperating the Jews from the Germans.  At night, the Jews take long marches, following the Nazis orders.  The Nazis may randomly take Jews from the march and shoot them in the head, killing them.  The pianish manages to escape this, but then he is on the run from Nazis.  Good friends help them, but then he is alone when the city is bombed.
I will not go on with the story (I left enough detail out anyway).  I will, say, however, that the story is brilliant.  The movie does an excellent job portraying the horrors, sadness, and torture the Jews had to face.  The actors do a wonderful job of making the movie seem extremely real; it is as if you are actually at the scene, back during World War II, and watching this happen.

1480508,5,B00005JLT5,"When Adrien Brody received the Academy Award for best actor in a leading role earlier this year, I was at first surprised. (I had expected Daniel Day-Lewis to be elected because of his incandescent portrayal of William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting in Gangs of New York.) Then I began to think again about The Pianist and realized that Brody's character -- Wladyslaw Szpilman --  was the focal point of that film from beginning to end...and that most of his portrayal was non-verbal. (Some may assert that the Warsaw Ghetto, not Szpilman, is the main character. They have a point.) Directed by Roman Polanski who also won an Academy Award -- as best director -- and deservedly so, this film examines a five-year period during World War Two when Warsaw was invaded and occupied by German and then Allied forces.
For me, the defining moment in this film occurs when a bomb exploding in the studio drives Szpilman from the piano and ends the broadcast of his performance. His obsession with creating art seems to exclude from his consciousness any deep concern about his family (parents, two sisters, and a brother) or about the brutalities amidst German occupation, especially in response to Jewish resistance. I have not read Szpilman's memoirs, first published as Death of a City (1946) and then as The Pianist (1998). All I know about him is based entirely on Brody's portrayal in the film. This detachment from the world around him is evident again later, as when Szpilman, in hiding, silently moves his fingers across a piano keyboard, lost in the creation of music only he can hear in that situation but which the film's soundtrack effectively provides.
Polanksi's film obviously celebrates human survival during one of history's worst periods. I realize that comparisons and contrasts of Szpilman with other characters in other films is probably a fool's errand. However, at the conclusion of the The Pianist, I thought about Sol Nazerman (played by Rod Steiger) in The Pawnbroker (1964) who, at that film's conclusion, unleashes a silent scream of unspeakable pain. For whatever reasons, there is no such indication that what Szpilman has observed (if not experienced) has similarly affected him. The war ends. Life continues. Szpilman's career resumes. Perhaps, just perhaps Szpilman's own emotions can only be expressed through the creation of great art. It remains for others to express theirs in other ways, perhaps with a silent scream.",1057104000,3,2444,5.0495049504950495

I agree with most of the reviews below as to the quality of the film and its acting -- all the awards are well-deserved.
It should be noted that there are several interesting minor characters in the film as well. Perhaps the most memorable is the Nazi officer (based on a real person) who helps Szpilman toward the end of the film.  But also notable are Szpilman's family members, as well as the crazy lady searching for her husband, Szpilman's lost love, the ""Pied Piper"" character, etc. All add depth and color to the drama of a world gone mad.",1056931200,3,988,4.645714285714286
1480510,5,B00005JLT5,"'The Pianist' is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman. I saw the DVD version after I had seen the movie in theaters 4 times, and after reading the book twice. The book was written immediately after the war, and it has a lot of detail that is unique. It is one man's perspective, and his lack of bitterness is remarkable. Roman Polanski has retained the honesty and the detached observation of Szpilman while making the movie. As far as the movie was concerned, the DVD did not add to what I had already experienced.  For me, the movie made a deep emotional impact, and the book is very inspiring. I liked 'The Pianist' even more than Schindler's list.  It goes straight to the heart, possibly because of the truth and the directness in it.
Adrien Brody- as Szpilman- is brilliant, and fully deserving of his Oscar. He is in nearly every scene, and he expresses so much without any words! Polanski and screenplay writer Ron Harwood have stayed very close to the book, at times including an entire scene, with dialogues and details from the book.
The DVD has, on the other side, interviews with Polanski, Brody, Harwood, and Thomas Kreschman (he played the German officer in the movie). It shows what went into the making of this great film. The German archives have footage of the Jews being taken to the train, etc. They were used in creating some of the scenes. Some things came from Polanski's childhood experiences- the Jewish police says to Szpilman, after saving his life, ""Don't run!""- it came from Polanski's own experience. What kept Szpilman alive after he lost his entire family was his love for music. The DVD has a clip of the real Szpilman playing Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor- the music he played before and after the bombing of the radio station. If only he had lived to see this movie!
 I would highly recommend the movie 'The Pianist', and particularly the DVD version for the extra material that comes with it.",1056931200,,1954,4.6579710144927535
1480511,3,B00005JLT5,"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.
What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor.
The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts.
Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them.",1056585600,9,1925,5.0251572327044025

For this viewer the larger screen version, though impressive, seemed to attract the vastness of the problem, the litter of corpses, the unrelenting bombings, spontaneous killings, etc.  Viewing this movie on the DVD format makes the story far more intimate and the performances by all members of the cast, headed superbly by Adrien Brody, much more compassionate and human and hence more credible.  Perhaps the story lends itself more to the hushed, in the living room atmosphere that is mirrored in the film than to the epic proportions on a large screen in a dark theatre with a distracting audience.

I don't know if it is that I'm also a pianist, but this movie moved me in a way that I have never been moved before.  Don't get me wrong, I'm taking not one thing away from Spielberg, but Roman Polanski made this movie much more personal.  It is told from the point of view of ONE man which makes it easier to identify with the character.  I had never heard of Adrian Brody before this movie, but I can definitely see why he won the Oscar.  He did an amazingly believeable portrayal of Szpielman, his struggles, his agony, and his torment.

1480536,5,B00005JLT5,"I rented this film expecting a story about the Holocaust.  What I saw was so much more.
The Pianist is a film about a Jewish piano player (whose name I will not even try to spell) who plays the last song heard on the Polish radio before the Nazis invade Poland in 1939.  His family is shipped off to the death camps whereas he is saved, but is forced to live in hiding for almost a year.  He survives for the sake of his music.  What an incredibly brave thing!  It is his music which saves him in the end; he is caught by a German Nazi who tells him to play a song on the piano.  After he has finished playing, the Nazi decides to leave him alone in hiding, for the music is so beautiful.  He even brings him food and clothing when the Nazis flee from the incoming Russians.  After returning to a normal lifestyle, he goes back to playing the piano on the Polish radio.
There is not much to say about this film other than the fact that I was stunned and awed.  This movie captures the very essence of what the Jewish people went through during the Nazi occupation.  I am a big history buff and this film was very accurate.  Some scenes were very horrifying, namely the scene when the Nazis pulled several Jews out of a walking line and told them all to lie down, then shot them all.  It was a very well done film, and I would advise anyone to see it, whether or not they know anything about the Holocaust or WWII.  Adrian Brody, who plays the pianist, certainly deserved the Best Actor Oscar for his performace.  It was simply stunning, as was the rest of this film.",1055721600,,1566,4.193979933110368
1480537,5,B00005JLT5,"While the movie and music CD are worth 5 stars, there is one bit of horror that we cannot forget--and it has nothing to do with the Holocaust. The CD that I bought had a sticker attached to it with the following Roman Polanski quote(Polanski was the one who made ""The Pianist"" film.) The sticker reads, ""THE PIANIST is a testimony to the power of music , the will to live, and the courage to stand against evil."" But lest we forget, it was Roman Polanski who in the 1970s made an arrangement to give a 13 year old girl a screen test, and ended up drugging her, then photographing her topless, and then raping her. Convicted, Polanski was released on bail, and promptly fled the country. He has yet to express any remorse for his behavior, and yet he claims the right to call the actions of the Nazis evil and immoral. It seems once again that evil and immorality is always something the other person does. If you think this kind of behavior is acceptable simply because Polanski has made a great movie, would you want a man with such a behavior pattern allowed to walk the streets of your neighborhood?",1055635200,2,1102,4.433497536945813
1480538,5,B00005JLT5,"What a relief it was to realize that great movies are still being made!  This movie is the best Holocaust movie I've ever seen and it will certainly invite comparisons to ""Schindler's List"".  Both movies are epic in scope and bring the reality of the Holocaust to life in human terms.  However, ""Schindler's List"" was made, I felt, as a tribute to the risks that an ordinary man took and the difference that it made in the lives of many people.  It gave us an uplifting message in a sea of depravity.  It did it well and it stands on its' own merits.  ""The Pianist"", if I'm interpreting it correctly, is about the survival of one man who witnessed the whole scope of the Nazi Occupation of Warsaw.  Through his eyes we see the fall of Warsaw, the implementation of the ""Jewish Laws"", the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto, the forced exodus of the Jews to the concentration camps, the Warsaw Ghetto revolt, the Warsaw Uprising, and the fall of the German Army to the invading Russian Army.  So many aspects of so many things are brought in subtle and in boldly stated scenes.  It is amazing how much is said in this 2 1/2 hour movie.  For example, there was one brief scene where a Jewish policeman makes a comment to a German soldier while hundreds of Jews are being loaded on the railroad cars for shipment to Treblinka.  I couldn't hear what was said and I was going to replay it to see if I could pick it out better.  However, I realized that I had already gotten the point; the Jewish cop had sunk so low that he was trading ""shop talk"" humor with his own oppressor while his people were being led to the slaughterhouse.
The acting is superb throughout the movie.  The cinematography is outstanding.  Everything comes together in such an excellent manner.  Roman Polanski certainly deserved his Oscar and I will leave it at that.  There is much in this movie that earned its' R rating.  However, that is because it boldly attempts to bring us face to face with the horror of the Holocaust.  I have seen an endless number of movies that have been R rated for no valid artistic reason except that they are full of unnecessary vulger obscenities and sexual explicity.  It's becoming a near impossibility to find a movie that my son and I can watch together.  I can watch this movie with my son and explain to him how anger, fear and prejudice can, if left unchecked, lead to the unthinkable becoming reality.  A number of people ridiculed the criticism of the uncut showing of ""Schindler's List"" on TV.  How can people object to 4 letter words and ignore the greater obscenity of the murders of so many innocent people, they asked.  But by eliminating the unnecessary use of profanity and sexual explicitness, we are able to focus on the real profanity and obscenity of what is happening in front of us.  Apparently it takes Roman Polanski to show this to Hollywood.
A final note about the movie has to do with its' ending.  I discovered some years ago that Holocaust literature, by its' nature, is not given to happy endings.  The story of survival is, to many, a happy ending of sorts but most stories of the Holocaust leave a person feeling empty.  This is true in ""The Pianist"" as well.  There is an interesting twist that, in any other movie, would lead to a positive statement.  We are lead down this path in anticipation of such an ending only to encounter a sudden dead end.  In analyzing our disappointment, we get a glimmer of the sense of meaninglessness that the Holocaust brought to its victims.  It is a statement consistent with Polanski excellent portrayal of the Holocaust.",1055635200,3,3588,4.5507020280811235
1480539,3,B00005JLT5,"***1/2 ""The Pianist"" is a bit like ""Schindler's List"" as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile - Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with ""The Pianist"" since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew - the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.
This is not to say that ""The Pianist"" is a better film than ""Schindler's List"" - far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option - having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto - Szpilman flat out declines the offer.  This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes ""The Pianist"" seem frustratingly superficial at times.
Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, ""The Pianist"" is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost ""reportorial"" objectivity.  As in ""Schindler's List,"" people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways.  Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  ""The Pianist"" doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  ""The Pianist"" brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.
Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb.  Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.
""The Pianist"" is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains ""The Shop on Main Street,"" the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what ""The Pianist"" is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  ""The Pianist,"" by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.",1055548800,6,3958,4.824224519940916
1480540,4,B00005JLT5,"Nearly a month has passed since I last saw the film but I still cannot erase the piano tunes out of my mind. In one of its most poignant scenes, the main character plays Debussy's 'Claire de Lune' in the middle of the ruins of Warsaw under a blue moonlight. It is a beautiful cinematic moment and for that reason alone I want to highly recommend this film.
  The Pianist is a film by Roman Polanski , the revered auteur of Chinatown and Rosemary's baby. He is a film maker who has led a life so fraught with hardship and personal tragedies that his story may as well be made into a movie. When he was still a child living in Poland his mother died in a Nazi concentration camp while he alone was able to escape. Tragedy ensued even as an adult. His actress wife, Sharon Tate was brutally murdered by members of the Manson clan in 1969. In 1978, Polanski was charged with statutory rape over a thirteen-year-old girl, which forced him to flee from the United States. He still faces arrest and imprisonment if he ever sets foot on U.S. soil. With such a colorful past, the fugitive director is equally sympathized and hated by many. While lately the victim girl (who is now a fully grown woman) announced to the public that she forgave him for his past crime, there's still much controversy over him, especially after the Best Director nomination he garnered recently. While people may still be divided in opinion over the director's personal life, there is little dissension over his recent work as being a deeply moving holocaust drama.
  The film follows the true life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman , a celebrated Jewish pianist who survived the holocaust by hiding in the ruins for many years. At the onset of the movie, we see him as his sophisticated self. He is a well-established artist, coming from a wealthy family, who is loved and admired by his own community. But after the fall of Poland, his life takes a sudden downturn. As the Nazis begin corralling Jews into the Ghetto, the normalcy of his life begins to disintegrate. Soon he is separated from his family, rescued at the last moment from being sent to his certain death at the concentration camp. For a while he is aided by his Polish Resistance friends who provide him with a hideaway. But the resistance is soon destroyed and he is again forced to survive on his own.
  Watching Polanski's film, one cannot help but make comparisons with Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. Both films depict the same subject, but their scope and tone are vastly different. Spielberg's story was anecdotal, with more attention given to the larger picture. Also it was more sentimental, with its sweeping score and climactic developments. In contrast, The Pianist focuses on a more micro-level. Everything that transpires in the movie is seen through the eyes of Szpilman (played hauntingly by Adrien Brody) and therefore the audience is given a deeply personal experience. As for the tone of the film, it is subdued and grim, the plot almost stoically averse to dramatization.
  According to the director himself, it was all deliberate. Much of the details in the movie were drawn from his own experience, and as such, he didn't want to embellish. Straying from how it truly happened would be trivializing his own past. The result is a story unhinged from any forced emotions. The film doesn't manipulate the audience into tears. The dry reality of the events themselves is sufficient to evoke the pathos.
  Events in our real life have the power to move us in a way no fiction can. Watching Szpilman's humanity being whittled down to its bare essence is moving because we recognize the reality embedded in it. Human nature can be fascinating. When faced with the bleakest of situations, one still finds a way to express one's hope. To Szpilman, that was the piano. Listen to him play the piano on a moonlit backdrop,  and you will know instantly what his tale is about.",1055462400,2,3922,4.710948905109489
1480541,1,B00005JLT5,"This movie is about A jew that survives the whole bloody war. In the end some German finds him , feels sorry for him and lets him live. He also goes on on play the Piano after all the $*** he has been through. Sorry if I messed up the ending but what can I say.......",1055376000,,267,3.7857142857142856
1480542,4,B00005JLT5,"Early on in this film, I thought to myself: ""Just another holocaust film. So what?"" I'd seen and read it all, from the enslavement of the Jews (and their initial inability to cope with the reality of what was happening all around them) to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto. It bothered me a little that I wasn't seeing anything new. But then again, I reminded myself, this wasn't fantasy-- this was history.
However, by the end of the film, I realized that this film does come up with something essential.
The key to this movie is the utter helplessness and claustrophobia of its protagonist. Mr. Szpilman struggles to obtain a work card for his elderly father, only to watch his family packed onto the train bound for Treblinka anyway. He's only saved by dumb luck-- a Jewish collaborator grabs him and throws him behind police lines, enabling him to get away. Why? Apparently because of his musical talent; the one thing that seperates him from the rest of the victims, and also something he had no control over.
Following his escape, the protagonist moves from refuge to refuge, and barely manages to elude the Gestapo. He gets sick, grows a beard, and eventually degenerates to the point where he's barely recognizable. In the end he wanders hopelessly through the burned remains of the ghetto, where he runs across something rare indeed: a Nazi commander with a heart of gold, who spares him-- once again-- because of his musical talent. Later, this officer is killed by the Russians, in spite of his courageous actions.
The moral of this story?
None, unless it's that no good deed goes unpunished, and that our actions have no relationship whatsoever to our destinies. But why should this film has a moral? Real life doesn't concern itself with messages; it is what it is. Ultimately this film is a brooding, ironic tale of a man who's forced to watch through one window or another as the world destroys itself. In the end, he survives by pure accident-- and perhaps that in itself is the message both of this film, and of the holocaust.",1055376000,2,2046,4.717877094972067
1480573,3,B00005JLT5,"This book should never have been made into a movie; the narration of the horros experienced by Wladyslaw Szpilman during the Nazi occupation of Poland was published soon after the war ended, and it constituted a powerful and frequently introspective story; I have not read the book, but the critique it has received from Amazon readers is uniformly good (nothing less than four or five star ratings). The truth is that some books simply cannot be transformed into successful motion pictures, and this apparently is one of them. It is an account of how events descended upon a man who remained a passive receiver of uncountable pain and horror; and how, in the end, he prevailed.
The ingredients that went into making this movie are all superb and beyond negative criticisms: the script is masterful and Roman Polanski directs with precision and meticulous concern for detail and nuance. Adrian Brody's performance reflecting his physical decay over time, and his increasing anguish, is certainly a tour de force of extraordinary acting. The film's theme of hope and of survival cannot be faulted. And so, why does the final product miss its goal, and become (dare I say it?) tedious? The clue, in Roman Polanski's own words, is this: ""The events [Szpilman] describes are not written like a novel, they are written like a journal, and are therefore unfilmable."" Exactly. This film consciously attempts to resemble the newsreels of the day; and like newsreels (in general) it provides the visuals and the immediacy of action without furnishing the transformations that lead to truly great art. When my mind started wondering about what kind of lighting was it that made Mr. Brody's ample nose become translucent, and was this being done on purpose, the movie had obviously lost my attention.",1055289600,3,1789,5.026936026936027

 Brody's entire family is wiped out and you see him staggering down the streets weeping like Deniro in a comical way, as in Analyze This: the worst acting I've seen in a lond time, Brody's speech was better.

1480575,5,B00005JLT5,"This is a stunning portrait of how one Polish Jew survived the Nazi Holocaust.  This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a concert pianist living in Warsaw.  This movie was directed by Roman Polanski (Chinatown).
The film opens in Warsaw before any Jews had been put into the ghettos.  Szpilman was playing the piano for Warsaw radio.  A bomb is heard in the distance.  He keeps playing.  Another bomb hits, but closer.  He is still playing.  When a bomb finally blows in the windows and knocks Szpilman across the room, he is forced to acknowledge what is going on.  He is cut, but unhurt.  He returns home to learn that the Nazis require that all Jews in Warsaw must relocate to a ghetto.  After some arguing, the family relocates to the Warsaw Ghetto.
This is a movie about the survival of one man during one of the most important and terrible times of the twentieth century.  The film never loses the focus of keeping the camera on Szpilman.  There is so much more going on than what we see on screen, but in the context of the film, those other things are not important.  This is a singular story and it is beautiful and haunting.  There are moments of absolute beauty and wonder, and there are moments that are excruciating to watch.  We know this is a true story, based on a memoir by Szpilman, but we don't know the details of his experience.

1480576,5,B00005JLT5,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist is the real life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who was a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland.  Adrien Brody plays Szpilman and he gives a star-making performance.  Szpilman is a concert pianist who plays on Polish radio and as the film begins he is playing on the radio when the area of Warsaw the station is in is bombed.  The Szpilman family is defiant at first towards the news of the German occupation, but then like all Jewish families, they are forced to follow the strict rules the Nazis set forth regarding Jews.  They are made to move from their spacious and homey apartment into a [cramped], run down space in the designated Jewish ghetto.  The family struggles for money, but Wladyslaw is still able to play piano in a Jewish restaurant for meager earnings.  Eventually the family is in line to be sent to a concentration camp, but through sheer fate, Wladyslaw is pulled from the line boarding the train and is spared certain death.  He then spends time working a slave laborer building the wall separating the Jewish section of Warsaw from the rest of the city.  Again, he escapes through the gracious help of others and through the underground resistance is kept hid in an apartment away from detection.  Although free from the ghetto, he is a prisoner in the apartment and at the mercy of others.  He is facing starvation when he is forced to flee the apartment when it is bombed.  He hides out in a hospital for a while and eventually ends up in the bombed out ruins of Warsaw.  It is while he is hiding in the ruins that he again faces almost certain death when he is discovered by a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann).  Hosenfeld speaks with him and asks what Szpilman's profession was and Szpilman replies he is a pianist.  There happens to be a piano in the house and Hosenfeld makes Szpilman play.  Szpilman plays a gorgeous piece and Hosenfeld is moved to spare Szpilman's life.  He brings him food and when the Germans are retreating from the Russians, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his coat to keep warm.  It is the exchange between Hosenfeld and Szpilman that is the heart of the film and shows that despite the horror of war and the atrocities of the Nazis, that the true spirit of humanity can still shine through.  Ironically, Szpilman survived the war and went on to continue his career as a pianist and Hosenfeld ended up a prisoner in a Russian war camp where he died several years after the war ended.  Mr. Brody is incredible in his part.  His facial expressions convey the sense of fear and hopelessness that Szpilman must have felt through his tragic journey.  Never once does go over the top, it a truly genuine performance.  Mr. Polanski also does a brilliant job of directing.  He details the senseless brutality and omnipresence of the German occupation of Poland, but never sinks into gratuitous violence.  The film was nominated for seven academy awards including Best Picture.

1480580,5,B00005JLT5,"I full appreciate and endorse the idea that there will be one film in your experience that brings home the horrors of the Holocaust for you, and after that point nothing else has quite the same effect.  This is true for me and actually came when I was editing out commercials of the television mini-series ""Holocaust,"" which had none of the graphic depictions found in theatrical films such as ""Schnidler's List"" and ""The Pianist,"" or even later television efforts such as ""War and Remembrance.""  But just because the full horror truly overwhelms you that first time and never with quite the same force again, does not mean other similar tales are not worth the telling.  I know I will never see a film that conveys the horror of war more than the opening sequences of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but that does not stop me from seeing more movies about World War II.
""The Pianist"" is an atypical story of a European Jew during this period because the title character, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody is his Oscar winning performance), survives the Holocaust.  There is a memorable shot of Szpilman walking down the street of the Warsaw ghetto after the deportation of the Jews and the streets are littered with their possessions.  Hundreds of characters in the film, thousands from the ghetto, millions throughout Europe were exterminated by the Nazis.  Szpilman is the exception, not the rule.
The horror of his survival is that is so random and very little of what Szpilman does contributes to his being alive at the end of the film.  The explanation, such director Roman Polanski provides in this film, is that Szpilman has value as a classical pianist, a cultural icon of sorts to the people of Warsaw, whether they are Jewish or not.  That is the key factor in the decisions, often impromptu ones, that save Szpilman's life.  But there is also the factor of luck, whether it is both German and Russian soldiers being poor shots, or simply where you stand in line.  You can see where the story would resonate with Polanski, who was pushed through the fence of the concentration camp by his father, who also survived.
In many ways ""The Pianist"" is a fitting counterpart to ""Schindler's List"" as a different sort of survivor's tale.  In Steven Spielberg's film the story is heroic because of the effort to fight the system and the odds (Oskar Schindler ended a lot high on the list of AFI's Heroes this week than Moses).  But there is little of the hero in Szpilman.  Instead he is a witness, who often has to do nothing more than look out the window to see both the atrocities committed by the Nazis and the turning tide of the war.  He is a mute witness as well, as much by temperament as by his vocation, although there is only one piano piece in the entire film where we sense that he is articulating his feelings rather than playing what he has been told to play.  But Brody plays many scenes without ever uttering a word and despite the title very few scenes have music if his character is not the one playing it.
The Pianist falls between triumph and tragedy, which may well prove unsettling to many viewers who want the security of provided by such categorization.  I have seen comparisons to the second half of this film with Castaway, and while I understand the comparison it falls through simply because Szpilman is a less than active agent in his own survival too many times.  But that is just another small reminder that The Pianist is history and not fiction and that the greatest horror is not the we are the victims of a grand design but rather of the arbitrariness of the fickle finger of fate.",1054771200,51,3609,4.631661442006269
1480581,4,B00005JLT5,"No one who cares about Roman Polanski's work should miss this DVD's taut documentary about ""The Pianist"" and its director.  Billed as a making-of featurette, ""A Story of Survival"" transcends that reliably lightweight genre on the power of Polanski's words and vivid recollections.
The director tells his personal story clear-eyed, almost matter-of-factly, but with heart. As he speaks, images from Nazi camera crews are intercut with nearly identical clips from ""The Pianist,"" showing how the director used WWII film archives to ensure authenticity of the movie. The making-of includes recent footage of the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman playing a Chopin nocturne (the pianist died in 2000).
Polanski says he chose the autobiography of Polish musician Szpilman because it was written right after the war, when the memories were fresh. The book's detail of the Nazi occupation was ""vividly true to me, a child of the same period,"" Polanski says.
""The Pianist"" looks fine, up to major studio standards. Audio is generally OK, in DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1, with a fairly tame mix that makes little use of the rear sound stage. Center-speaker dialog is noticeably muffled at times.

It is a truly mesmerizing story. While it is somewhat slow in the beginning at sucking you in, you will be fully there by the end, I guarantee.
The movie doesn't ever get political, nor does it get graphic or gory. It's simply one man's account of what it was like to be a Polish Jew and live through that time in history. Oh, don't get me wrong, there's plenty of violence and death. It's just not dwelled on. Nor are the horrors of Auschwicz, though we know what's happening through what we studied in history class and what we do see on screen. When thousands of Jews are ""relocated to the south"" we know fully where they are going and what their fate will be.

The first scene takes place in a radio studio where the character Szpillman (Adrian Brody) is playing the piano over the Polish Radio. Then out of nowhere in the background a thrusting explosion is heard and soon the building in which the pianist is playing gets bombarded with bombs as the German take over goes unknowingly underway. This is how the film starts! With an instant beginning the film instantly begins the character's run through survival. After the families get weekly decrees from the German Nazis of rules on how Jews can only live and from then on the brutal reality of history portrayed by Roman Polanski is something you just have to see for yourself. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it definitely will be a fast two hours because the scenes ,dialogue and whole story is so beautifully connected that it will almost feel that you were by his side the whole time as he tries so desperately to survive by hiding in bombed up buildings and ghost towns and a hospital that was evacuated after it was emptied by a fight from the Germans against some Jews who had some guns. Well this movie is one that I am happy I just bought because just writing this review makes me want to watch it right now!!! This is a beautiful film and I think Roman Polanski did everything right towards the making and story line of the film. It just has such a heavy atmospheric and emotional feeling when this film is watched and you won't move out of your seat, I guarantee it!",1054512000,4,2059,4.295629820051414
1480624,4,B00005JLT5,"Films like The Pianist are important to watch for those of us born after WWII.  It is hard to believe such things actually happened, and if we forget such utter depravity is possible it will happen again.  This film shows how one average Jewish Polish family was destroyed during the Holocaust.  It portrays well how powerless human beings truly are against institutionalized evil.
  That being said, I could not help but compare this film with ""Life is Beautiful (LIB).""  At first I thought LIB was the better film because it is more ""entertaining,"" meaning there is a greater range of emotion -- you laugh and cry.  The Pianist elicits mostly negative emotions, and can get tedious.  But then I realized that this is also a part of the suffering that the protagonist went through -- fear without relief for 5 years, waiting and not knowing what had happened to his family or what would happen to him, having to remain silent, hiding and waiting.
  This movie is probably closer to the truth of human experience than LIB.  Although both protagonists of The Pianist and LIB are very talented, The Pianist does not idealize the life of its main character as does LIB.  The Szpilman family is also not ideal -- they do not seem to be particularly pious or observant Jews, they do not know each other well and there seems to be the average amount of family discord and jealousies.  Wladyslaw (the protagonist) is more lucky than brave or smart.  He survives by playing dead, but then is almost shot by Russians for wearing a German coat.  He allows himself to be separated from his family and is not able to return a kindness to a German officer.  He appears stunned and numb for much of the movie, simply focused on survival.  In short, he is an Everyman with one great talent -- like most of us.
  So, is The Pianist a good movie?  It depends -- if you are looking to somehow be entertained by a Holocaust movie -- then watch LIB instead.  However -- if you watch movies to engage your mind and you want to understand the realities of war and evil -- then this movie will help you imagine how terrible war is, and how powerless everyone becomes in its face.  This can be the first step towards whatever action your conscience leads you to take.  The worst evil of all is apathy.",1054512000,2,2277,4.526960784313726
1480625,5,B00005JLT5,"THE PIANIST [Adrian Brody / Directed by Roman Polanski / 150 minutes / Rated R for violence and brief strong language]
""The Pianist"", Roman Polanski's remarkable drama about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust in Warsaw, Poland in the early 1940s, is the best depiction of the subject since Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List""; in fact, in some respects it is a better movie. While Spielberg and his family grew up in the safety of the United States, Polanski [born in 1933] and his clan were Polish victims of the Nazi atrocities. If there is a problem with ""The Pianist"", it is that some viewers will find it too painful to watch. This is a horror movie in the literal sense because it depicts man at his worst in real life. To this day, I have difficulty accepting emotionally that all this occurred just sixty years ago, though intellectually I know that it did.
Adrian Brody plays real life pianist Wladslaw Szpilman, who was on track to becoming one of Europe's foremost performers when the Nazis invaded Poland. Within months, he, his family and more than 500,000 other Warsaw Jews were crammed into a ghetto comprising a few city blocks. It wasn't long before more and more people disappeared, having been shipped off to concentration camps. The pianist uses every trick he can think of to survive in a living nightmare which goes on and on and only gets worse.
Mr. Brody won Best Actor and Mr. Polanski Best Director at this year's Oscars. At the time it seemed a surprise upset to many people. In retrospect, the awards were richly deserved.
Because of its subject matter, ""The Pianist"" isn't suited for everyone. [Children should have a grasp of history before seeing it, for example. But it is also very rewarding and a great example of the art of movies.",1054425600,3,1769,4.728155339805825

1480629,5,B00005JLT5,"Jewish pianist Wladyshaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is considered to be the most gifted pianist in pre-World War II Poland. Music lovers eagerly await his shows on Polish radio, and fans travel to Warsaw to meet him. But when Nazi Germany invades Poland, Polish Jews begin to be persecuted. At first they are forbidden from public places, required to wear arm bands identifying them as Jews, and are restricted in the amount of money they can keep. Then all of the Jews in Poland were relocated to a small part of Warsaw that became a Jewish ghetto and confined there. Wladyshaw Szpilman and his family were among them. Szpilman managed to survive the difficult and terrifying life in the Warsaw ghetto for several years, until only 60,000 of the original half million Jewish occupants remained. He escaped to the outside before the ghetto was burned and was hidden by some friends in the Polish underground. Even with the aid of others, Szpilman became deathly ill and nearly starved to death on several occasions before the Russian army finally drove the Germans from Poland and he was free to come out of hiding.

""The Pianist"" is the story of Wladyshaw Szpilman's struggle to survive the desperate circumstances that Polish Jews faced under Nazi occupation, based on Szpilman's autobiography. ""The Pianist"" was directed by another Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation, Roman Polanski (whose parents paid for a rural Christian family to keep their son while they were taken to a concentration camp). Roman Polanski has said that he would never make his own story into a movie, and he waited a very long time to direct someone else's. ""The Pianist"" is a long movie, and it contains a lot of material that would not be essential to tell Szpilman's story. The extra material helps pace the film and is included in such a way as to give the film a lyrical quality, create mood, and enhance our understanding of the environment in which Szpilman and his countrymen were living. Presumably for personal reasons, Roman Polanski did not cut this one to the bare bones. That's fine because the added length gives us a chance to see more characters, some very fine cinematography, and more of Adrien Brody's excellent performance. ""The Pianist"" is engrossing enough that its length doesn't produce boredom. There are a lot of minor characters, and all of the film's performances are impressive. I highly recommend ""The Pianist"" for its incredible story of perseverance, great performances, beautiful cinematography, and inspiring tribute to the power of music.",1054252800,9,2557,4.9882903981264635

In this way he is an everyman. I did enjoy that. I did enjoy the portrayal of Warsaw (the city I was born and raised in and which was leveled be the Nazis - and by the way, he was the only director who ever thanked people of Warsaw for their patience during the shooting as many streets had to be closed) but I was not thrilled by the cinematography.

This movie was touching especially towards the end where you see how hard it has been for the pianist to survive (sorry, his name, I still can't figure it out, even after reading the back of the DVD, I'm only 16)!
Though I loved this movie, it is not what I expected, but was pleasantly surprised, and quite honestly, I do not know what I expected from it... but I know I got more than I expected...
Adrien Brody was captivating in this film... if he wouldn't have won the Oscar, something had to have been wrong with the Academy!  He is brilliant, one of my favorite scenes is when he plays the piano without touching the keys... but I have a favorite scene, but I won't tell you what it is, you MUST watch it, and when you do see it, you'll probably know which scene I'm talking about.
On that note, WWII is my favorite period of history, because the cruelty of Hitler makes me wonder, and interests me because I don't see how a human being can be so cruel, and this movie doesn't answer the question, it just makes it harder to understand why because the story is true.
It's hard for me to write a review, (as you can see, I jump from subjects, and ramble), because this movie can't be explained in words, only by watching it can you experience the feeling of the movie in all its glory!",1054166400,2,1460,4.203571428571428

We seem to get at least one main stream or indy flick a year dedicated to this... and AMAZINGLY, most all get an Oscar nomination(s) of some kind.

I'm giving this film 3 stars for three reasons (1) Brody, he wears that haunting look exceedingly well (2)Cinematography and (3) Polanski gets a point for DARING by following a passive character whose sole purpose in the film is self-preservation.  I suppose he was destined to make this film due to his own personal history, but an Oscar nomination?  It's interesting that he decided against one that was autobiographical.  At any rate despite Brody's best effort (and a good one at that), I felt less inspired and more manipulated.
True story or not, I struggled to stay awake in this one.  I managed to do so for most of the film by counting the number of wanton, random and impersonal atrocities used liberally by Polanski in getting his point across.  I lost count around 30...",1054080000,3,1218,4.766666666666667
1480758,5,B00005JLT5,"It's very funny for a Polish citizen to read about the ruins where Szpilman was hiding (eg. ""among the ruins of the Warsaw ghetto""). It prooves that many people haven't seen this picture with enough attention.
Szpilman has been hiding on the so called ""aryan"" side of the wall since his escape from the Ghetto.
He has been watching the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto (April 19 May 18, 1943) from the window of an ""aryan"" house. During the Warsaw uprising (August 1 - October 5, 1944, about 200 000 Polish victims) he has been hiding at an ""aryan"" apartment, then in ruins of a hospital occupied prevoiusly by the Wehrmaht, and finally in a house where he has met the ""good"" German officer.
The sea of ruins you can see on the screen while he is going down the ruined street - it was just Warsaw, not its part - the Ghetto. In fact, the Ghetto has been destroyed yet in 1943.
Warsaw as the capital city of Poland was destroyed in 95% in result of the WWII.
In my opinion the movie is a masterpiece. Polanski didn't even try to make this picture more sophisticated or studied. He has tried to show the Szpilman's story (and, somehow, his own) as accurately and exactly as possible, without any fireworks. And he was right - this movie looks almost like a documentary.

1480759,5,B00005JLT5,"I see dozens of movies each year. I have studied about and read hundreds of books on World War II and seen many of the movies and mini-series on it.
Yet I never felt closer to the horror, the reality and the mundane day-to-day living of it than through this film.
Roman Polanski lived as a child in a Jewish Ghetto in Poland. His experience informs each moment of this film and takes the viewer right into the streets and the alleys of late 1930's, early1940's Poland.
The film begins with the young pianist, portrayed memorably by Adrien Brody, playing for the Polish radio. The studio ends up being bombed-but it is more of a ""ok, here are the bombs, let's move on,"" than an overally dramatic reaction. That's the beauty of this movie: surreal horror is incorporated into everyday lives.
The film then traces the descent of Brody and his family from their beautiful aparment in the city, into a smaller one in the ghetto, into the waiting area for a concentration camp. They are not saints-they fight, they snip at small things, they roll their eyes at an annoying woman in the waiting area (until they hear her tragedy)-and such humanity makes the horror so much more real.
Through a series of improbable twists (but as has been noted, those who survived did so only because of improbable twists), Brody's character escapes the train to the concentration camp and ends up going underground in the city. I won't say more to ruin anything.
I would highly recommend this movie to individuals who appreciate serious, intelligent moviemaking on profound themes. I would not recommend this movie to individuals who need a lot of action or melodrama or levity. This movie achieves a soul searing impact not through hand-wringing dramatic scenes but through subtle and at times silent small moments.",1053648000,6,1794,4.790322580645161

At the close of this film you will feel as though you have lived through everything that Szpilman lived through, as well as those who were not so fortunate.  You will feel weary at the end...you will feel like you have triumphed over something.  You will feel a duty to live your life to the fullest and to allow others to live their lives as well.  You will learn a lesson that we all should learn.  The human spirit cannot be broken so long as there is something it can hope for.
Brody is exquisite as Szpilman, taking on the burden forced on the musician by the oppressing Nazi invaders.  You can look in his eyes and see the pain that Szpilman must have felt.  You can also see his strength.

Adrien Brody's perfomance was spectacular!! He deserved 110% the oscar he won. The directing oscar was very well deserved too. This film shows how extreme and devastating the holoucast was. I've always cosidered the holoucast the most horrible and unhuman things in history... and this film made me realiza that i was right.

1480804,4,B00005JLT5,"The Pianist is a good film, but not great.  I don't understand why this was such a big winner at the Oscars!  (Even though Chicago took home double as many Awards, with 6)
First- I don't think Adrien Brody deserved the Best Actor Award.  Did anyone even see Nick Cage in Adaptation!?  He was so excellent.  The only reason why he didn't win was becasue that movie had an off-beat type of brilliance.
Second- Why in the world did Roman Polanski win?  In a way I am glad the Martian Scorsese didn't win because I believe he'll be back in the upcoming years with an even better film that will sweep the awards, including Best Director.  But, what about Rob Marshall?  Chicago would have been nothing without him!  Rob had the great idea for the musical numbers being metaphors and daydreams in Roxie's head.  Plus, Marshall choreographed all the numbers!  That is amazing dedication.  Plus the editing was smooth and well done.  I just didn't sense that Polanski had the same pashion.
Thirdly- Charlie Kauffman had the Oscar stolen from him for best screenplay: adapted material.  Every scene and line in Adaptation shines with creative characters and brilliant words.  Actually, the movie's main showcase is the writting, because it is SO GOOD!  I have NO idea why the pianist won, and if you see Adaptation, you'll be wondering too.
That being said, I thought that The Pianist was definetly one of the better films over the past year.  I think everybody knows that this is nowhere near Schindler's List.  But, then again, what film about this subject matter is?  Not a bad effort at all.  But, not worthy of all the praise.",1052092800,2,1622,4.684397163120567
1480805,3,B00005JLT5,"Polanski, a survivor of what we have all come to accept as 'humanities darkest hour '(notwithstanding many other equally confounding, affecting and, as yet, cinematically un-surveyed 'darkest hour''s) has delivered a curiously affected, slovenly piece. All the sketched outlines of an outstanding film are present and accounted for: galvanising (if overly familiar) backdrop, a strong central perspective and experiential trajectory (in the form of Szpilman's tenacious, determined character), excellent production values. All that is missing is a sense of effort on the part of those most centrally involved.
Polanski's direction is undistinguished, mechanical, heaving the 'The Pianist' along with all the zeal of a put upon carry donkey. The pace of the film is leaden and contains a high 'oh, get on with it' quotient, which should be fatal for a film with such high-minded, literate pretensions. The scenes of the ruined Warsaw ghetto are intensely re-created, but fall more or less in line with those images we have come to expect from a film dealing with an aspect of the Holocaust, adding absolutely nothing onto the already fixed perceptions burnished onto (many of) our collective conscience (courtesy, in some ways, to the far superior 'Schndler's List').
The main problem with this film, most puzzlingly (read: alarmingly), is Oscar winner Adrien Brody. Although sporting the requisite haunted look, he never quite gets under his character's skin, or allows sufficient erudition as to his motivations (a must in a realist text like this). This robs the already moribund film of what could have been its greatest, and saving, virtue.
All said, the film is not bad, per se. It might have been more accomplished. Hopefully Hollywood will now shift its attention to some other worthy historical texts.",1052092800,3,1809,5.328671328671328
1480806,5,B00005JLT5,"Above all, The Pianist is an excellent film. I waited until after the Oscars to see it. So I won't pretend that I was an early, unbiased fan. I saw it because I heard so many good things about it and because it won several awards. It was described to me as, `A better and more personalized version of Schindler's List.' So I went in expecting a quality film. And I was not disappointed. I tried to be as objective as possible when viewing it and I don't think the Oscar hype had an effect on me.
The film had some fairly clich elements. Such as the standard animalistic Nazi soldiers who parade around and randomly shoot Jewish citizens. I also thought some of the scenes in the ghetto were heavy handed. As though our faces had to be rubbed in the filth before we would understand the despair and evil humiliation that the Jews withstood. But these problems are small and they didn't really effect the film as a whole. And the `psychotic Nazi soldier' clich was countered effectively by the Nazi officer who showed compassion in the end. The biggest positive element of the film was the way it showed the best that man can be while also showing the worst that man can be. It really made me sit back and question many things. It brought up ethical issues like `might makes right versus universal individual human rights' and `when is killing right or wrong and who truly decides?' The film had an intellectual quality that raised it from simply being good, to being excellent.
If you are looking for an expertly crafted film about the survival of a real man in an unimaginable situation, The Pianist fits the bill. I recommend it to anyone who would appreciate an excellent historical drama and a story that captures both the best and worst qualities of mankind.",1051920000,4,1762,4.544025157232705

1480808,5,B00005JLT5,"I saw The Pianist on my birthday 3 months ago.
I had heard some good reviews and was very interested to see what Polanski had been up to lately.
I was astonished, moved, and speechless.
The movie embodies everything that I love about film....a true story being told with love and great care for the past, and in a way that makes you feel the pain that the characters experience.
Adrien Brody will now get the credit he deserves after his 10+ years in the industry. His performance was genuine and brilliant. He has been my favorite actor for a few years and out did all of his previous work with his role as Wladyslaw Szpilman. I cannot think of a more deserving performance of the Best Actor Oscar in recent years.
The Pianist is an unforgettable film about a simple man who hangs on when all hope and life is lost from the world he knows.",1051660800,54,840,4.356687898089172
1480809,5,B00005JLT5,"Polanski proves that being adept at the surreal or fantastical does not preclude a director from composing an effectively thoughtful and linear story. If anything, Polanski demonstrates that true vision knows no bounds. Like many, I wasn't sure how much more of the Nazi regime imagery I could stomach. Quickly I became endeared to the character and found myself pulling for his survival as if it was really taking place. These days it is so difficult to become so absorbed in a film. For a movie to pull this off requires an amazing vision and a successful unfurling of that vision and all its detail. Many forces seemed to work together to achieve this accomplishment.

What is so profound about this film is the degree to which the viewer becomes transmogrified through the course of following the central character in his determination to survive.
The war scenes and depictions of brutality are, in my opinion, done truthfully and in a manner that lends credence to the story.

This movie captures the fundamental human feelings that ultimately pull us all together. It does so without catering to any sense of ""political correctness."" Good and evil are demonstrated by Nazis AND prisoners.

More than another ""war movie,"" this film transcends genres and moves into the realm of greatness. Whatever you think of Polanski the man, this film is brilliant.",1051401600,12,1357,4.969162995594714
1480810,5,B00005JLT5,"IT'S AN IMMPORTANT FILM ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH AND THE SURVIVAL OF ONE MAN LIVING AGAINST THE ODDS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S THE MUSIC THAT SAVES HIM.  ADRIAN BRODY DESERVED THE OSCAR AS WELL AS ROMAN POLANSKI BOTH PUT SO MUCH OF THEIR SELVES INTO THIS FILM.  PLEASE WATCH IT WITH AN OPEN MIND AND AN OPEN HEART, DO NOT LOOK AWAY FROM THE SCREEN FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION AND REALIZE THAT WAR DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.  ART IS IMMPORTANT SO LIVE FOR THE COLORS IN MUSIC AND FILM FOR IT'S THAT FREEDOM THAT ENSURES SURVIVAL.",1050451200,3,514,4.333333333333333
1480811,5,B00005JLT5,"A moving, understated, almost documentary-like story of a  Jewish pianist's attempt to survive the Nazi holocaust in Poland. Polanski's direction is beautifully restrained, there is no spelunking in violene nor melodrama, but a simple, unrelenting story of both a people's suffering and especially one man's suffering and survival in a world temporarily gone mad. The note of hope at the end is realistically done and mitigates but does not cancel out the suffering we have just spent the past two hours witnessing. Adrien Brody's Academy Award was not only deserved but indeed ineluctable unless Hollywood wanted to publically confess it is no longer interested in film as art. This is an infinitely sad, infinitely moving but also infinitely human testament  to the art of music, the art of life and the art of film.",1050451200,6,818,5.097014925373134
1480812,3,B00005JLT5,"Well made movie alright, but we have seen countless depictions of war time Nazi domination. I expected from the title that ""The Pianist"" would mean something about the struggle of a pianist to save his people or to contribute to war, or to use his musical capabilities to escape or something! But this is JUST ANOTHER ESCAPE movie!
I mean, it could easily have been ""The Barber"" and how he saved his life and in the end gave a fabulous haircut to a good samaritan German general and everything could still be oh so touchy touchy.
I just don't get it. Anyway, good movie worth watching but it is a war movie afterall...with all the cliches of war (like Nazis being real rude and stuff).",1049932800,8,685,4.488
