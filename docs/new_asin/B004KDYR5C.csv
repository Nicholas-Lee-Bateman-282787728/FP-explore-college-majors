8432808,5,B004KDYR5C,it was everything my son expected. he really likes to watch mick foley. it came on time and was in great shape. no problems,1461369600,,123,4.166666666666667
8432809,5,B004KDYR5C,"I was surprised when I heard Foley jumped to TNA. I always thought Foley was a great wrestler. I think sometimes he could get a little full of himself and think he was the greatest ever. I do respect Foley for what he did in coming to TNA. He came there to try to make wrestling good again. Foley being rich from wrestling and writing doesn't need to be involved in wrestling anymore. I also respect Foley for being a kind, caring and generous man in his charity work. RF Video has a Best Of Cactus Jack DVD Set that covers his entire run in ECW I recommend you buy that. I loved his run in ECW more than WWE or WCW. Of course some of his best matches in WWE were against Taker, Austin, Rock, HHH, and HBK. I thought Foley in mid 1998 and early 1999 helped WWF start really kick WCW's butt. I think with Austin out of the picture he stepped into that spot and proved he could carry the ball against The Rock.

  One of the best matches on the dvd is The Cage Match Sting vs Foley. They both put on a great match and a great moment for Foley to get the belt. I think it was a good decision to put Foley in a wrestling role. Foley being their champion gave them more credibility. Another great match on the dvd is Kurt Angle vs Foley. It was an amazing match and proved Foley could still put on a great match. Angle and Foley worked well together. Another great match was Bound For Glory Foley vs Abyss in a hardcore match. It was a big one. It was great. You can see similarities between Abyss and Mankind character. I think Foley helped Abyss a lot and it was good for Abyss's career to say he wrestled Foley.

  During the period Foley came in TNA it was getting hot. Sting's Heel Turn and formation of The Main Event Mafia was great. Sting's Heel turn went pretty well and MEM was one of the greatest factions TNA ever had. Foley jumped into the picture to help The Front Line in a supporting role before fighting Sting. I would have picked a young guy to beat Sting for the belt rather than Foley. A guy like Styles or Rhino so The Front Line would have gotten atleast a major victory and TNA wouldn't all be about pushing older guys. I do think it was a good move to give Foley the belt for a brief run. One of the only complaints of the dvd is it's missing his epic hardcore match with Kevin Nash. Overall this covered his entire career mostly.

  There is also a good match with Foley and Jarrett on here. My favorite match on here is Foley's match against Flair. Those two squashed their beef but they put on great matches. Foley represented the greatest hardcore wrestler ever and Flair the best wrestler period. There is a great clash and conflict there. It was like Bird vs Magic. Two different people very gifted in their craft. Great match. You also hear from other TNA Wrestlers on Mick Foley.

  All in all this is a great dvd that covers just about everything. Foley had a positive impact on TNA. Unfortunately TNA made the mistake of getting Hogan and thus their downfall. I was satisfied with his run in TNA. I thought he should have only stayed a couple years. In the end he had some great matches in TNA and is remembered for being part of TNA when it was on the rise. Cheers!",1402099200,,3195,4.219672131147541
8432810,4,B004KDYR5C,"I really enjoyed this Foley dvd. Its really cool to see some behind the scenes stuff on Mick, and also i liked seeing him in TNA. I missed all of the original programming. Sure he has lost a step or two or Three, and he would tell you that himself, but this was his most interesting Dvd, until the current wwe release from 2013.",1356912000,2,328,4.140625
8432811,4,B004KDYR5C,"I'm so happy I got this dvd. Awesome matches, cool extras. Do I recommend this to those are a fan of wrestling & Mick Foley to be spectific? VERY STRONGLY!",1354838400,,155,4.2
8432812,4,B004KDYR5C,"I like this DVD because it shows more about the man outside the ring,some family moments,and charitable efforts. I like his wrestling but i'm not a big wrestling fan so to see the man doing what he does outside the ring is something speacial. I only wish they would have seperated it on the two disks,one of his out of the ring happenings and one of his TNA wrestling career but they are all kinda blurred together. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.",1307145600,,468,4.211111111111111
8432813,5,B004KDYR5C,"While this could've been 2 discs, loaded with more footage of his charity work and stuff he's done outside of the wrestling ring, TNA has done a good job bringing Foley fans a DVD they can enjoy. Loaded with matches, segments and some good interviews from other wrestlers, Mick Foley: Hardcore Legend showcases what Foley still has to give to the world of wrestling and how he can still have a good match even with all his injuries.

We start out with a video package talking about the birth of hardcore wrestling and how Foley himself brought his own sick and twisted side to each match he was in. We hear from guys like Jeff Jarrett, Tommy Dreamer and Abyss on how they describe hardcore and how Foley has helped shape what and how the hardcore style is today.

We then go to Jeremy Borash and Mick Foley talking about each match or segment then we see the clip. Both have some good insight especially Foley.

-10/2/08: Foley's TNA Debut: An in-ring promo by Foley talking about how he's happy to be in TNA. Good but short promo here.

-Genesis '09: w/Brother Devon & AJ Styles vs. Scott Steiner, Booker T and Kip James: This was Foley's in ring debut and only the last few minutes are shown, where the match got restarted under anything goes rules. Its a good brawl, Foley almost has his leg shattered when AJ does a splash onto James through a table that Foley happened to be partway under. Foley wins by DDT'ing Steiner onto a chair for the pin. Not bad for what is shown. 6/10.

-3/19/09: w/Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting (TNA Champion) & Kurt Angle: This match was more about putting a storyline over, where Angle kept beating on Foley, much to the dismay of Sting to the point where he got in Angle's face and told him to just pin Foley. The finish of the match was good though as Foley hit Sting with a chair for the pin, which of course leads to their Lockdown match. 6/10.

-4/16/09: Foley interviewed Cactus Jack (aka himself) on the upcoming match he has against Sting at Lockdown. Its a good, dark segment that ends with Foley beating on Sting and standing over the fallen world champion.

-Lockdown '09: TNA World Title Match vs. Sting: These two have a history dating back to their '91-'92 fued in WCW, and well given how good the hype was for this match, it was actually a pretty solid main event. Especially given how both men are clearly past their prime, they both brought their A-games. Sting worked on Foley's leg some so Foley couldn't climb out of the cage and couldn't go through the door he had locked shut earlier. Foley used the barbwire bat on Sting's leg and both men used the cage as a weapon numerous times. Sting also got some usage out of the bat as he smashed Foley with it 5 of 6 times. The finish comes when both men are climbing out of the cage and Foley drops down seconds before Sting can to win the world title in about 15 minutes. New TNA champion: Mick Foley. 9/10.

-Victory Road '09: TNA World Title Match vs. Kurt Angle (Champion): This isn't too bad of a match, given how both men are pretty banged up from years of taking chances in the ring and also that Angle was dealing with a groin injury. Foley does actually display some good wrestling moves including a front face lock and an arm bar. For the first few minutes Foley does dominates, then Angle does send Foley into the steel steps and starts working on Foley's leg with kicks and stomps. Angle locks in the ankle lock but Foley reverses it and eats a massive clothesline. Foley hits an elblow drop to the outside on Angle, then back in the ring locks on a body scissors and uses the mandible claw on Angle. The ankle lock is locked onto Foley who gets to the ropes but Angle kicks his hand away and Foley taps out, Angle retains his title in about 14 minutes. 7/10.

-Bound For Glory '09: Monster's Ball Match: vs. Abyss, Special Guest Referee Dr. Stevie: Foley hits Abyss with a barbwire bat during Abyss' entrance and so begins are hardcore dream match. Foley knocks Abyss off of a piece of the set through the stage, then runs and dives on Abyss with the barbwire bat in hand. Best spot of the match was Abyss bursting up through the stage all horror movie like. The action is fairly brutal from here on, with numerous weapons being used including a trash can, a barbwired board among others. Most of the times its a handicap match with Dr. Stevie helping Foley beat on Abyss. There is a tazer spot that is pretty lame and a botched 3 count that brings down the match to a halt for a few moments. Daffney comes out and gets chokeslammed from the top rope through another barbwire board. The finish comes where Abyss hits the black hold slam on Foley and Stevie makes the 3 count with a little help from Abyss. 8/10, a couple points off for the bothced tazer and 3 count.

-Final Resolution '09: Foley's Funhouse Rules Match: w/Abyss vs. Raven & Dr. Stevie: Its a good brawl, Foley breaks out some classic offense including the running knee in the corner and the tree of woe elbow. The action breaks down with Abyss/Stevie and Raven/Foley
pairing off with the latter pair even leaving the arena for a bit. Raven comes back to the stage and starts choking Abyss with a kendo stick and even bites at the burn wounds Abyss sustained recently. Foley comes running down the ring with a shopping cart full of weapons and runs it into Raven and Stevie. Foley starts using the weapons including a street sign and a barbwire bat on both men. The sock is brought out by Foley but Raven throws salt into his eyes. Abyss hits the Shock treatment on Stevie while hitting a legdrop on Raven. Foley wraps a barbwire ring around Stevie and lays him on a table, then Foley hits a diving elbow through the table from the stage. Finish comes when Abyss reverses a DDT by Raven into the Black Hole Slam for the win in about 9 minutes. 7/10.

-3/22/10: vs. Jeff Jarrett: This was from Impact and was a No DQ/Loser leaves TNA match. Beer Money were made the special referees for this match and it had the expected under-lying theme of both men going all out but not wanting to make the other guy leave the company. Both men kept trying to gain the advantage, Foley broke out some unexpected moves like a backslide then starts nailing Jarrett with fists and kicks. Back from the break, both men are on the stage Jarrett hits a snap suplex on Foley. Jarrett starts working over Foley and even tries pinning Foley with his feet on the ropes. Foley DDT's Jarrett on a chair then breaks out the sock and uses the mandible claw. Finish comes when Jarrett hits the Stroke on Foley on a chair for the win in about 9 minutes. 6/10.

-10/7/10: Last Man Standing Match vs. Ric Flair: If this is Foley's last TNA match or his last match period then this was a good way to go out, against one of the greatest of all time in Ric Flair. Its a good brawl from two men who show age is just a number as they both go all out. Foley brings a barbwire bat into the ring and smashes it into Flair's face a few times, busting him wide open. The action spills to the stage and Flair launches Foley off the stage through a table. Back from break we're in the ring and Flair is wearing Foley down and even brings out some thumbtacks. Flair runs at Foley but is backdropped onto the tacks. Foley brings out a bardwire board and runs it straight into Flair in the corner. The referre counts to 5 before Flair gets up and starts chopping Foley, but a table is brought out by Foley, Flair hits a lowbow, sets Foley on the table, slams him with the barbwire board then hits a top rope splash through the table. Flair does his classic faceplant right into the tacks as Foley is declared the winner since Flair couldn't answer the 10 count. Match length was about 10 minutes. 9/10.

-We now get treated to some of his work outside of the wrestling world, including his childhood and how that influence him to write his best selling books. We hear from Foley about how he felt he needed to write the books so people who read it would understand the real story and the pain he went through. Jarrett, Abyss, Angle and others offer their takes on how successful Foley has been outside of wrestling.

-There's a story about how Foley used a line that kinda slammed Matt Morgan and how he asked for Morgan's permission, which was granted.

-We also get a peek into his home life and how he enjoys spending more time with his family, which is pretty touching to watch. Foley even shows a scrapbook he made, which was neat to see.

-There's the story about how Foley has donated his brain to science once he dies and how the head injuries he has suffered will help people learn more about concussions and head trauma and how to prevent them.

-He talks about his dad and how he influenced his desire to do more charity work, from his trip to Africa and other countries doing goodwill work. Tazz and Morgan talk about how Foley's charity work, even with Morgan saying he enjoys doing it and will keep doing it long after his own career is done. There's videos showing how he's helped build schools and other places in Africa and how that was more gratifying then performing in front of massive crowds of wrestling fans.

-Foley talks about his work with RAINN, Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and how music artist Tori Amos helped him decide to work with the organization. He split the money from the sales of his latest book Countdown to Lockdown, with half going to RAINN and half going to and African group for abuse victims.

-Dreamer says he can see Foley being around wrestling, movies, charities and anything where he can contribute and make a difference. Borash and Al Snow say Foley will continue to do great things and that the best is yet to come. Angle, Abyss and Jarrett praise his in-ring and outside of the ring work and how the crowd connects to him.

-Foley says his next focus should be on his kids as he's missed out on a lot due to his wrestling career.

Extras include:

-A segment with Ric Flair and Foley doing a great in-ring promo hyping their last man standing match that was included on the DVD. These two are magic on the mic and go back and forth very well and both start punching themselves til they bleed and still keep talking. What a well done and emotional segment. This leads to Foley talking about how if his and Flair's books hadn't been written that fans wouldn't have been able to see the great back and forth banter from both men.

-The next segment is where Foley helps advance the concussion angle TNA had going with Mr. Anderson and Matt Morgan, where Anderson was sidelined with a real concussion. This was a great piece of business as Morgan cut a great promo before Foley came down to and admitted he suffered a concussion in the last man standing match he had with Flair. He also says he has suffered way too many of those and never allowed himself enough healing time and that Bischoff and Flair are exploiting Anderson's injury. Flair rips Foley's hardcore wrestling and that he has caused people to kill themselves in the ring to get over with the crowd without actually wrestling. Foley doesn't dispute his claims but says he wants to be part of the solution. This was easily one of TNA's best in-ring promos as each man did a great job selling the storyline.

This is easily one of TNA's best DVD releases, the parts where Foley is with his family and the charity work he's done are very touching and show he's not just a wrestler. The matches are good, as its always nice to see the Impact matches released on DVD.",1303689600,,11509,4.420481359131666
8432814,4,B004KDYR5C,"After making his mark in companies like WCW, ECW, and WWE...Mick Foley brought his talents & name value to TNA Wrestling resulting in various matches & moments captured onto this DVD set.  Along with the match selections, we got a personal profile as we hear Foley & others on various subjects such as what is hardcore in their minds, his wrestling style, the story behind him becoming an author & writing his books with an interesting story behind Matt Morgan's involvement in his latest one, him donating his brain to science & the issue of concussions, his charity work including the RAINN organization, how people will remember him & his future while also being treated to seeing footage of him at home with his sons.  You'll also hear from Tommy Dreamer, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Al Snow, Taz, Kurt Angle, Matt Morgan, and Dixie Carter throughout the presentation as well.

Matches (Hosted By Foley & Jeremy Borash) Include:
TNA In-Ring Debut w/A.J. Styles & Brother Devon vs. Scott Steiner, Booker T, Cute Kip - This was originally scheduled to be Foley & the members of the Frontline group against the Main Event Mafia but with Kevin Nash getting injured (AGAIN!), Cute Kip took his place.  The match was joined in progress & picks up after Foley restarted the original contest under hardcore rules.  As expected, plenty of weapons were used from trash cans to chairs to the announce table with the only real highlight being A.J.'s splash onto Kip through a table...with all of that landing on top of Foley's leg.  The tag match before this wasn't anything special & the restart helped a little bit but past it being Foley's in-ring debut, this is easily forgettable.
Genesis 09

w/Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting & Kurt Angle - This was Foley's in-ring debut on Impact along with Jarrett's first Impact match in 2 years in a tag match that happened right after Destination X where him & Jarrett were the special enforcer & referee for the match between Sting & Angle.  Foley was able to out mat wrestle Angle in the beginning to the shock of everyone causing Angle to resort to dirty tactics such as getting the M.E.M. bodyguards involved before using a steel chair & Angle Slam Foley onto the floor.  There was still tension between Sting & Angle which we saw throughout the match as Angle refused to tag Sting & kept beating on Foley because Sting kept showing mercy towards Foley saying ""THAT'S ENOUGH, JUST PIN HIM!""  However it was the ending of the match that completely shocked everyone & setup the main event for Lockdown.
""Impact"" Mar. 09

vs. TNA Champion Sting - Before the match, there was a change to the rules in that you could also win this match by escaping the cage but only climbing over the cage & dropping to the floor as the cage door was locked. Foley came as his Cactus Jack persona and busted himself open before the match got started. They told a good story here as Sting hurt Cactus' leg early on to the point where Mick had problems climbing out of the cage so his decision to have the cage door locked backfired so he tried different ways of escaping the cage...including trying to squeeze himself through one of the camera holes in the cage. It wasn't a blow-away match but you can tell both men tried their hardest here as it was the best Sting match probably since Bound For Glory while Foley heavily made up for his lackluster performance at Genesis months earlier. I'll give Sting & Foley credit here in that they did what Triple H & Randy Orton couldn't do at Mania in that although their match didn't top the the previous two matches, they were able to follow it up and give it the best they could.
Lockdown 09

vs. TNA Champion Kurt Angle - It should be noted that this was the first one on one meeting between these two & Kurt was going into this match with a legit groin injury which saw him not go as ""all out"" & intense as Kurt usually does and you saw him heavily favor it as one point after missing a moonsault. I'll give credit here in that Mick gave the best in-ring ""wrestling"" performance he's had up to this point in TNA with using various moves like a bodysissors/mandible claw combination. This was a solid bout but again, nothing really memorable.
Victory Road 09

Monster's Ball Match vs. Abyss w/Dr. Stevie as the special referee - This match had a special stipulation that if Abyss used thumbtacks in this match, he would lose by disqualification (yes, a DQ in a hardcore match). They started out on the stage that at one point saw Abyss go through it only to come out the ramp like it was a scene from a monster movie. I don't want to give too much away here but the only negative things I can say here is that the way the ""tazer"" came off looking when it was used was just so hokey & there was a big botch with the count at one point that it was worthy of the chant it got. Past that, you had barbed wire come into play via the baseball bats & wooden boards covered with it, thumbtacks, and Daffney getting involved & doing something so unexpected that it had the arena chanting through the video package for the next match ""She's Hardcore! She's Hardcore!"" You got just about everything you expected in his match & more just based off the reputation both men have when it comes to the word ""hardcore.""
Bound For Glory 09

Foley's Funhouse Rules Match w/Abyss vs. Raven & Dr. Stevie - Despite the crazy title, this is really just a hardcore match as Foley & Abyss were out for revenge for the fire incidents on Foley's eye & Abyss' leg caused by Raven & Stevie in the previous weeks. As you would expect, they brought out all the plunder (Dusty Rhodes reference) & fought everywhere from kendo sticks, trash can full of weapons, barbed wire baseball bat while fighting in & out on the ring to the stage & ringside. One moment to look out for was Stevie being wrapped in barbed wire on a table before Foley delivered his classic elbow drop. If you like hardcore matches, this is for you.
Final Resolution 09

No Disqualification/Loser Leaves TNA Match vs. Jeff Jarrett - This took place shortly after Hogan & Bischoff arrived in TNA with both Jarrett & Foley being a pain for Bischoff leading to this match where Bischoff wanted to get rid of at least one of them.  Beer Money were the guest referees while Bischoff did commentary here.  This was actual a good straight wrestling match between both men as although the match had a no disqualification stipulation, they didn't go there past a chair getting involved but it was a good match overall.
""Impact"" Mar. 10

Last Man Standing Match vs. Ric Flair - The spokesmen for their respective groups (Foley with EV2 & Flair with Fortune) met here days before Bound For Glory.  Both men were bleeding ""crimson mask"" with various weapons used such as a baseball bats & boards covered in barbed wire, thumbtacks, and tables.  Hardcore spots were taken by both men such as Foley being tossed off the stage though a table, Flair backdropped onto tacks & later splashing Foley through a table, and Mick getting beat up with his own book.  In what was been Foley's final match (so far), this was the hardcore war that we should have gotten in their feud back in 2006.
""Impact"" Oct. 10

Other segments shown on the DVD include his debut promo on Impact & the interview Foley himself conducted with Cactus Jack while DVD extras include the face to face meeting with Ric Flair the week before their Last Man Standing match & his confrontation with Immortal over the issue of concussions.

They captured most of Foley's career in TNA on this DVD with the only match that wasn't included that I felt should have was his Legends Championship match against Kevin Nash from Hard Justice but overall, this is one to add to the collection for any fan of Foley, TNA, or just hardcore wrestling.",1303171200,7,7773,4.544349070100143
