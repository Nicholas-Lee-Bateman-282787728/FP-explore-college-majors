8740911,4,B017WW1R50,"We hear that the prosecutor is gay, and at one point we see a naked man walking, but we don't know if the naked man is a prostitute or a lover. Other than that, it was very interesting seeing a prosecutor fighting an uphill battle at a time when the prime minister of Germany wanted to forget the past and protect criminals like Globke.",1534032000,,336,4.265625
8740912,5,B017WW1R50,"Frau Ruckhaus makes a point that the scenes are quite short. Nevertheless, the acting is so fine and restrained, no Hollywood tricks or fake music. A much more realistic, dialogue rich, portrayal of anti-fascist hero Fritz Bauer, that is dense and uncomfortable, as it should be. Very realistic and much much more potent dialogue than The People v Fritz B....even the actor who plays him is better, he is almost annoying in his tenseness, as he should be, this man who conceived of his job as to make Nazis uncomfortable.",1531785600,,521,4.8
8740913,2,B017WW1R50,"About the only good thing about this film is its subject. I have never seen a film with such poor editing, I got dizzy with the jumping from scene to scene, none lasted longer than 5 seconds. A much better film on the subject is The People vs Fritz Bauer.",1522454400,,255,4.12
