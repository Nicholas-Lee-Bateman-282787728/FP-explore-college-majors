8242996,3,B0011YZVO4,"The Dracula Saga is a rather ragged attempt at a costume horror movie that sadly fails on more levels than it succeeds. The story follows a young couple travelling to a remote castle in central Europe to visit the remaining family relations of the wife, who is pregnant. Along the way villagers warn them that the castle is evil, and dead bodies are found along the way with neck wounds. Nothing very original there! On arrival at the castle, all manner of strange things happen as the truth about the family background is revealed...which should come as no surprise, bearing in mind the title of the movie! There is a fair amount of nudity, with lots of female cast members removing their blouses, and some gruesome action as well, especially at the movie's climax.

Unfortunately the enjoyment of all this is hampered by some very basic shoddiness. Although Deimos Films have found a beautiful clean print, and colours are rich and clear, a lot of shots are out of focus. No amount of remastering can correct badly focussed photography, and it really shows. Several shots also have a gauze-like mesh effect overlaid on them, which at first I thought was a technical issue, but in reflection it might have been a failed attempt by the director to add atmosphere. The acting is not very good, the English language dub is truly awful, and in another bizarre lapse of continuity, the heroine clearly wears different wigs in different scenes throughout the story!

I suppose this accounts for why Leon Klimovsky never made it as a big name horror director. Having a stunning authentic castle as a setting and adding lots of bare boobs does not make up for all the other budgetary and artistic shortcomings. Even European beauty Helga Line (in a minor role) is wasted here. I do love Deimos' presentation of these Euro horrors, they do very well with the quality, packaging and DVD features. This is just not one of the better movies.",1451952000,,1930,4.75820895522388
8242997,2,B0011YZVO4,"As soon as I saw the name Leon Klimovsky I knew I wanted to see this movie.  The film ""Werewolf Shadow"" that he directed is one of my faves, and even though I knew Paul Naschy wasn't involved in this one, I hoped that some of his genius might have rubbed off.  Plus I've been very impressed with all of the Spanish horror movies I have seen so far, so I was hoping for the best with this one too.

But unfortunately this film was just not up to the standards of Naschy or de Ossorio.

The problem this time out is that the script is just not that interesting.  While watching this I found myself literally falling asleep and had to turn it off and watch the rest another day.

Yes, Narciso Ibez Menta does make for a distinguished looking Dracula, and in other hands I think he could have gone down in history as one of the great ones.  But unfortunately his character just doesn't get to do very much in this movie.

The story has ol' Drac longing for a male heir because the family line is dying out (wait a sec, I thought vamps were supposed to be undead and immortal?).  But his only male offspring is a twisted one-eyed deformity, so now he is placing all his hopes for the family's future on his pregnant granddaughter who is coming for a visit with her husband. (But it is never explained why she is not a vampire, and why she doesn't seem to know that the rest of the family are vampires.)  Oh, and somehow these vampires can go out in daylight for short periods of time too -- or is that just more low-budget cost-cutting day-for-night filming in broad daylight?  Yeah this plot doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense and is full of unanswered questions.

When the film finally drags to a close, the ending is actually not that bad if you like black humour, but it just feels like getting there has been a pretty tedious chore.

The DVD looks great and seems to be part of the same Spanish horror series that has been issuing very nice versions of the Naschy back catalogue.  But this is one of the lesser entries in the annals of Spanish horror.  Overall I would only recommend this movie to really die-hard hard-core fans of 70s Eurohorror.  Everyone else can safely pass this one by without missing anything.",1258761600,,2223,4.346246973365617
8242998,5,B0011YZVO4,"After I saw Klimovsky's excellent Werewolf vs. the Vampire Woman, I knew I had to check out some of his other movies. When I saw the trailer for this on YouTube, I knew I would dig it (Don't watch the whole thing, it gives too much away!). It's creepy and cheesy (in a good way) and so cool. Gore, nudity, and weirdness abounds, but it has a classy look to it...and the harpsichord music is a perfect fit. Move over Lugosi and Lee, Narciso Ibez Menta is the best Vlad Tepes ever!",1226966400,4,479,4.217391304347826
8242999,5,B0011YZVO4,"I am a film junkie!  And I can say that if you love quirky, rather esoteric fims, this one is a pure gem.  I'm not big on the average fair of spanish horror films; however, Victory's The Dracula Saga stands out as the premiere example of excellence in Spanish horror. I rate this film up there with Vampyres and Alucarda, and Spider Baby, reminiscent of Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers, it is that great: great character development, great atmosphere and mood, great story development with a black humor tinge.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is into 'not the usual' and is looking for something worth watching over and over again. The dvd quality is excellent, despite some visible artifacts like the netting used to soften scenes at certain points; color is vivid, picture is clear, and sound is nicely ranged. This is a collector's prize!

I edited this review (12/03/2011) to expunge a rather uneducated and truly untenable opinion of the films of Paul Naschy. Since I first posted this review, I have been seriously viewing his films, and have acquired a completely different opinion of him as an actor and screenwriter. The Dracula Saga is not the kind of film to be compared to Naschy's films; his films seem to be an entirely different style and orientation. That said, along with The Dracula Saga, which stands alone in its own right as incomparable, I have collected most of Naschy's films that I could acquire. He was in his own right a true master of not just Spanish cinema, but world cinema, and I prize my collection of his films on dvd. I can't wait for his last film to come to dvd in the States, Empusa! To those whom the previous version of this review offended, I do sincerely apologize. I have become a true Naschy convert!

I am still waiting for Blood and Roses to come out on dvd, though - this movie is the absolute best of the best, another in a class of its own!",1206316800,12,1908,4.567251461988304
