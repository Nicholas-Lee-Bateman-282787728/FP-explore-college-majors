2218952,4,B0007LPDLS,I really enjoyed watching this documentary.  It was very informative and I had no idea one of the places featured was so close to me.  I highly recommend it if you are into shows like Modern Marvels or anything on Food Network.,1136160000,,227,4.380952380952381
2218953,4,B0007LPDLS,"Very enjoyable & light-hearted look at some great, Mom & Pop burger joints around the US. An absolute must for any restaurant owner or burger fan.",1124409600,2,146,4.653846153846154
2218954,5,B0007LPDLS,Saw this on Sundance or IFC channel channel last night. Every captivating story of every hamburger joint is a joy to behold. Each place is so unique so individual and the people who have run them for generations are so passionate about what they do it is downright inspiring. Think I'll pass on the butter burger and the one with melted peanut butter. Everything else made me terribly hungry.,1120521600,11,392,4.695652173913044
2218955,5,B0007LPDLS,"I saw this documentary last weekend at the River Run Film Festival in Winston Salem and it was a smash hit.  George Motz did a superb job of uncovering one of our most treasured cultural icons in an entertaining and hillarious way, and that is saying a lot coming from a vegetarian.  This guy has definitely got a great career ahead of him.",1114473600,9,340,4.380952380952381
2218956,5,B0007LPDLS,"Whether you love hamburgers (grilled, boiled, covered with green chiles, or slobbered with butter), love movies about Americana, or just love human stories, this movie is for you. I went to the New York release last week and was among the hundreds of people who couldn't get enough; the hour was too short. I am buying three copies today for friends and will keep returning to this whenever I want a gift that will make people laugh and think. The film reminded me of how you don't need to leave the country to learn about people's differences; just traveling from New Haven to Santa Fe to Meers (Oklahoma) to Chicago with this documentary does the trick. I highly recommend this to you--for yourself and those you want to make happy.",1108166400,6,734,4.653846153846154
2218957,5,B0007LPDLS,"Lot's of fun to watch, great insight to how diverse the hamburger is in America, The length of the show is just right.",1381708800,,118,4.173913043478261
2218958,5,B0007LPDLS,"I saw this on either Sundance or IFC and just enjoyed it.  I really wish the guy who made the movie would make another one about other special hamburger places. I've seen he's done a book, but a movie would be awesome.",1357689600,,218,4.190476190476191
2218959,5,B0007LPDLS,"Quite simply the best piece of modern Americana you can ever get outside of a Springsteen, Guthrie or Josh Ritter album.  The movie is like getting in an old station wagon and driving across the country.  Every set of owners and workers here love what they do and Motz keeps out the narration to let their pride drip onto camera.  My favorite place is the joint in Meers, Oklahoma.  The owner tells ""yankees"" that mustard only goes on his burgers because ""ketchup belongs on the fries.""  I have Italian cousins and gave them this film as my best attempt to explain American culture.  Too many documentaries today examine political polarizing subjects.  Hamburger America is refreshing.",1298332800,,685,4.904347826086957
2218960,3,B0007LPDLS,"I usually watch the Food Network and The Travel Channel to find restaurants that would be really worth taking a trip to, but a few of these places probably should not have been on the list.  On one hand, the movie included three hamburger places that are also on the Food Paradise DVD (the oldest burger joint, the steam burger, and the burger cooked in 90-year-old grease) which were worth viewing in further detail on this DVD, but some of the places had no business being considered some of the best in America.  One place had peanut butter on the burger and one had a glob of butter on the burger.  That's it!  Those should have been on the list for most unusual burgers, but being slightly different does not make them amazing.  If I wanted to try a burger that way, I can put peanut butter or butter on a burger myself.  Also, some places were discussed in detail more for their history than for what makes their burgers unique.  The Billy Goat restaurant section mainly discussed the Chicago Cubs curse and the ""Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger"" motto.  How about explain what makes the burger itself taste good?  I felt that this documentary showed a few hamburger restaurants truly worth checking out, along with a few unique ones in which the burgers did not really look that special.  I'd recommend the Food Paradise DVD over this one.  The burger section is better and it has a number of other sections.  Hamburger America is not a bad movie, but it is average because only half of the hamburger restaurants truly look like they are worth visiting.",1275004800,3,1568,4.661818181818182

2218963,5,B0007LPDLS,"Awesome video.  If you're a foodie, you'll love it.  I didn't do my research before purchasing this video.  I thought it was about the best burgers in America.  Rather, it's about some very unique burger emporiums.  I've already been to two of the featured places and plan to eat a burger at each of the burger institutions included.",1198886400,3,333,4.672413793103448
2218964,5,B0007LPDLS,"Hamburger America is a true foodie's love affair. I first encountered the film in Santa Fe, NM so I was able to eat at the inimitable ""Bobcat Bite"" whose green chile (they spell it with a ""e"" out there) burgers are as phenomenal as the decor of the place is simple. You won't strictly need the sides due to the size of the burger, but the cole slaw is fabulous.

Now that I live in Connecticut, I am soon due a pilgrimage to Louis's Lunch in New Haven and a side trip to try the steamed hamburgers in Meriden. There is nothing like a fine hamburger -- nothing! ""Hamburger America"" is a wonderful paean to the best burgers out there; there are so many others that deserve to be included, so do give us a sequel.",1160697600,4,710,4.220588235294118
2218965,5,B0007LPDLS,"A film that chronicles people, their lives and passions, just as much as it chronicles burgers.  The title is fitting, as one becomes familiar with different regions of America offering different renditions of an American Classic, the Hamburger.",1140912000,2,245,5.447368421052632
2218966,5,B0007LPDLS,"One of the warmest, most pleasantly lip-smacking film's ever!

Made by a guy with a super-sized heart, AMERICA is a joyous

celebration of the burger, and the down-home folks who create

some of the most wonderfully odd versions of it. Take it from

someone who has the HAMBURGER AMERICA poster hanging up - this

little treasure is a home library essential.",1136851200,8,358,4.80327868852459
8048422,2,B0007LPDLS,"I was really shocked by how disappointed I was with this.

Instead of a documentary with a theme or lesson, it really is just 5 or 6 interviews of various Hamburger Joint owners who have no common thread, other than that they've been around along time.

Motz is often talked about in the cooking / burger community and I hope his other work stands higher than this.

Honestly, this felt like a promotional cut designed to give networks a taste of what an ongoing series of ""Hamburger America"" would look like if it got greenlit. Obviously it didn't and now Motz sells this to consumers.",1511913600,,586,4.561904761904762

8048430,5,B0007LPDLS,"As a retired chef I have cooked thousands of burgers in hundreds of different ways. My tastes were dictated by seasonal ingredients, location, the customer's general taste threshold, and any worthwhile trends. The basic burger is a wonderful platform for creativity. Hamburger America is a mouthwatering journey through diversity. While I would never put peanut butter on a burger, I would try it once. My personal tastes are simple. I want to taste the beef so if you can buy chuck meat, some sirloin, and a Delmonico Steak, and you have grinder--make your own. Or, buy some fairly lean chuck, pick a marbled sirloin strip steak, and pick a marbled Delmonico steak; take the three packages and ask the butcher in the super market to give you a hamburger grind. ( A cheaper good grind is always 80-20 chuck!) You should end up with 3-4 pounds of burger, about 8, 8 ounce burgers. This will be a somewhat expensive burger but worth it; season slightly. An 8 to 9-ounce burger patted out to a 1/2 inch thickness is yummy. Cook to medium rare or no more than medium.  Pan fry in a cast iron pan if you have it. Grill over a mesquite infused fire for quite a delightful treat. In grilling consider adding no more than a tablespoon of real butter to the middle of the burger; grilling can quickly dry out a burger if you are not careful.  I season specifically at home; some black or green fresh ground pepper,  and kosher salt (always use kosher salt; it's a marvelous seasoning), or minced onion, or TB of butter. If I am splurging, I buy an 8-pack of seeded, soft potato buns, about 4 inches in diameter. Lightly toast the buns, butter slightly, or a little Hellman's mayo (ONLY!) or nothing. I have been just toasting the  buns because my juicy burgers soak up those juices very nicely. I add a slice of american cheese, Land-o-lakes or colby cheddar to each bun half, then lay the burger on. If you can wait a few minutes, go POPEYE Wimpy on the burger. You wait because the juices get situated in the burger instead of running down your chin. No ketchup or mustard, no lettuce, tomato, or onion. This is my purist burger; toasted bun, cheese, burger and a final pinch of kosher salt. I have been eating this lately. Everyday burgers are a 5-6 ounce burger from a simple burger press; take a piece of 4-inch diameter PVC drain pipe and hacksaw it at no less than one inch thick; wash completely,  lightly pack burger into the pipe mould, turn out onto cutting board and insert into sandwich baggy, fold over, put in freezer. It's my emergency burger supply. With these emergency burgers I freeze English muffins. Cheese or no cheese; mustard only, or ketchup only, or Hellman's only. Or no condiments. I keep it simple most of the time. Exotic home burgers can also be somewhat burnt yellow onions, or shaved on my slicer red or yellow onions, or a thick slice of Bermuda, red, onion, or sauteed mushrooms and bacon strips (3 cooked strips broken up and split between the buttered English halves; you then put a slice of cheese on each bacon bun because the heat of the burger melts the bacon in place.) and Swiss cheese. Another unusual burger is one with cheese and a over-easy egg (or hard) on soft potato buns;  a drippy Wimpy burger! What will you be eating tonight!",1382659200,2,3271,4.563884156729131
