8344451,3,B001KQFASU,"A film arriving with little hype or fanfare proves that if packaged neatly with a succinct narration, it can sustain the interest of the audience despite being devoid of a big star cast.

Debutant Sasikumar, who had his initial training under Bala and Ameer has followed their path in choosing a different plot for his first film and succeeds in delivering a slick product. He has sketched, in an impressive fashion, the lives of people who are drawn into killing, portraying Madurai from a different perspective.

A sample of artful editing can be palpable in the sequences wherein the chutney turns into sambar in a different place in the plate and in the scene where a bucket of water one takes to bathe turns into water on the other's head. Director Sasi's approach is throughout realistic: he chooses shots carefully, amplifying the film's tone of realism deeper. Kudos, also, to the art director who has brought in the feel of the 80s in all the scenes.

Subramaniapuram is certain to be lapped up. However, this is not a film for romantic buffs.",1300838400,,1052,4.769230769230769
