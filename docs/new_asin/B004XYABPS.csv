4498397,5,B004XYABPS,"Let's face it: Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson are -- and always will be -- the original, definitive, best -- ""Girls Next Door""! Seasons 1-5 are pure magic. Fun, frothy and surprisingly charming. Three Barbie dolls living in Barbie's Dream House. (So what if Ken is 80 years old. Ken was always an afterthought anyway. Just an excuse for Barbie to have a wedding dress.) But when the three original GND left Hef for Marriage, Vegas and a Travel Channel series, fans of the show knew it would never be the same. They were right. Fortunately or unfortunately, life at the Playboy Mansion continues -- and with that came three new girlfriends, Crystal Harris and the Shannon Twins (Karissa and Kristina). Like them or not, the ten Season Six episodes are produced by the same people who brought you vintage GND and the result is a series of fun, cleverly put together episodes that still have much to offer. Who can resist Ukranian bombshell Dasha when she tries to muscle in during Hef's trip to Italy? Or Barbi Benton joining the girls for a 70s-style roller disco party? Of course, Holly, Bridget and Kendra are here, too. The original Season Five finale (Transitions), originally aired as a two-parter, is presented here in it's entirety -- and with bonus footage not seen on E! Then Holly appears in the first two episodes of Season Six when Hef takes his new girlfriends to Vegas. Bridget appears in a later episode as the host of a fashion show. And then all six GND get together for Kendra's baby shower at Mary O'Connor's house. If you are a GND fan -- or just a fan of good, well produced reality shows -- you should ignore the naysayers and ""haters."" Season Six is a fitting finale to a great, ground-breaking series and a must-have for fans.",1311552000,7,1772,4.664536741214057
4498398,1,B004XYABPS,"Im going to confess, when GND season six originally aired on `E!' I took a pass, seeing that the original cast departed, I had no further interest. I wasn't surprised to learn the ratings plummeted and the show was soon canceled following its season/series finale, I assumed I didn't miss much, and I obviously wasn't alone in not watching.

So in seeing this DVD being released this year after its failure, I couldn't help but laugh, but in reading a synopsis I realized the real stars and original cast  Holly Madison ,Kendra Wilkinson and Bridget Marquardt were still involved in episodes. Episodes of which I hadn't seen, so I caved and bought this DVD at a fitting low cheap price from a competitor shopping site to add to my GND DVD collection.

This DVD includes the farewell episodes of Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson and Bridget Marquardt, as well as the Kendra baby shower one, an absolute upside, because I had never seen those. The truth of the downside of matters is that I was disappointed that the commentary addition to the special features was solely done by the fail triplets that tanked this show Crystal, Karrisa and Kristina. I reluctantly listened to their attempt to do commentary and within minutes I realized there was no entertainment value or special behind the scenes info to be had, with the insertion by which I would assume was Crystal where she says, ""we just watch...... and talk about it??"" I swiftly turn that crap off, and in the little time I did listen to them commentate it was obvious they were going to be rude and derogatory to the original cast in the small here and there cameos they appeared and just be blatantly moronic, revealing further validity in my opinion that they are the last people that should have been given the position of carrying this show further, and had no respect for the people who made it possible for them to even be there in the first place.

Overall this DVD of GND Season 6 gave me as a fan a horrible closure to a show that was once fully entertaining, and gave me an introduction to some of the most horrible women I have ever seen in television history Crystal, Karrisa and Kristina.",1311379200,43,2159,4.629242819843342
4498399,1,B004XYABPS,"I am NOT a Playboy fan.
I started watching the show in the winter of 2009.  I gave it a chance,
I ended up becoming a fan of the show.
Why?  I liked Bridget & Holly.

So, I was a late bloomer to getting the actual five seasons of the show on DVD.

This season 6 I do NOT acknowledge.  Why?  Because the Girls Next Door are Bridget, Holly & Kendra, NOT the runaway bride & those twins who I am guessing were just there to get as much as they could.
So, I only watched three episodes:  Bridget's, Holly's & what you would call Kendra's even though Bridget & Holly were in it.

Where you saw the chemistry between Holly & Hefner-you saw ZIP between him & the runaway bride.

I will NOT buy this DVD set-NOT FOR 3 EPISODES.

And, the Kendra episode.  So just for TV.  Big huge NOT REAL stuff about the runaway bride & those twins buying gifts for Kendra or caring about her to do this.  The show did it or Hefner made them because he is still close to Kendra.  So fake the runaway bride & the twins.

End of the franchise-which actually happened with season five.

DO NOT BUY THIS, if you are a real TGND fan-we know who the real TGND are, NOT THE RUNAWAY BRIDE & THE TWINS.",1311206400,14,1170,4.065789473684211
4498400,2,B004XYABPS,"It is clear that E! wanted to make this season seem more about the old ""girls"" than it really is. The old girls appear on the cover, several of the menu photos feature the old girls and they appear in many of the deleted scenes.

That was smart on E!'s part because the new girls are not nearly as entertaining as the original three. After watching this entire DVD with commentary from the new girls, I can only say that I am not surprised that this season did as poorly as it did. I wanted to like the new girls but they come across as vapid, catty and vain. I had hoped that this was due to editing on E!'s part, but through the commentary it is easy to see that these girls are truly just vapid, catty and vain. They mock Holly's laugh and mannerisms and make snotty comments like ""she looks good for her age."" They make rude comments about other bunnies. They clearly have very little in common with Hefner and don't care about him in the way that the old girls appeared to.

The bottom line is that these new girls behave in the way that people assumed the original girls would behave before their season's aired. We were all pleased to discover that the original girls were intelligent, classy, and truly seemed to care about Hefner. The new girls don't share these traits.

Beyond that, Season 6 appears to be much more staged than previous seasons. I don't fool myself into thinking that Reality TV is truly reality, but at a certain point a show begins to feel so staged that it becomes unwatchable. This season teeters on that brink. Commentary from the girls confirms that many of the situations and conversations were staged by the producers.

Huge GND fans like myself will purchase this DVD despite all this because we just can't help ourselves. The commentary is interesting for an inside look at the mansion and the few episodes that feature the old girls are a great reminder of how fun this show used to be. But go ahead and pass on this season if you were hoping for more of the first five season's charm, fun and entertainment. You won't find it here.",1311120000,37,2071,4.442105263157894
4498401,2,B004XYABPS,"I just pre-ordered this Season, but I cancelled at the last minute and decided to wait a little longer to make up my mind at the right time. If there is one. I am a GINORMOUS fan of The Playboy Brand in general, and I own the last 5 seasons already on DVD so why not just complete my collection? But not quite yet. It's been a pretty long while since we've seen ""The Fab 3"" -- Holly, Bridget, and Kendra all together anyway, and my grudge against them leaving the show, while Hef attempted to ""replace"" them with these 3 new Gold Diggers is pretty much gone, but I still like to make fun of it all, LMAO. I knew they wouldn't last and it didn't take them that long at all to pack it up and say ""sayonara"", eh? *yawn* Good riddance!

Shows just how good Hef really had it when he had his ""main dish"", Holly and his 2 ""sides dishes"", Bridget and Kendra. Whatta' complete moron he was for letting Holly get so depressed, causing her to leave his sorry arse after 7 whole years of loving devotion. I already knew that Kendra would be one of the first ones to leave because she was so young and had a thing for young jocks (and I was right, lol) ... and Bridget... she would soon follow because... well... what else would she have done? Her relationship with Hef was nothing but business anyway.

Oh well, things as well as life change, my friends... and The Fab 3 all have their own reality shows as well as new and better lives without Hef anyway. So HAHAHAHAHA to Mr. Playboy. I just hope that at least Holly and Kendra continue to make their dreams come true and don't fade away! Hey, I still like to laugh at everything that transpired, even as a big Playboy fan... and a GINORMOUS TGND FAN! But I am NO fan of Hef. I will always be a HUGE Holly fan, though. Holly won and Hef lost. How can there ever be another successful season without ""The Queen Bee of The Playboy Mansion?"" The original 3 girls were so, so beautiful, smart(in their own special ways, lol) savvy, and each of them had their own special and unique relationship with Hef. They were like their own ""little family."" There was just so much positivity in The Mansion!! -- Unlike this season with all the negativity and immaturity of ""The New Girls Next Door."" BAH!!

Now, for the these magic questions to be answered: Will Hef approve a brand new filming of a Season 7 with a fresh new batch of Gold Diggers?? Will there be a whole break up/broken engagement/moving the eff outta' the mansion episode with Crystal and all of that, just like how it was in the beginning of this season with Kendra?? BAHAHAHAHA!! Sorry, I couldn't help myself. :P Hey, ya' never know. Maybe his fresh batch of ""new additions"" would be way more entertaining than these 3 flakes ever were. Also, what is Hef's new masterplan be in his attempt to ""get back"" at all who have left him?? More new girlfriends becoming Playmates every month?? One of them ending up as Playmate of The Year?? OH!! Is there a chance that he and Holly could ever get back together now that Crystal is out of the picture?? Hhhhmmmm... such food for thought. Sorry, I just have to say again what an IDIOT Hef really was/is. What a ""show"" he put on just to hurt the ones he really loved the most deep inside his heart, but will never admit. Just like a clown. It's amazing how life unfolds, isn't it?

Anywho, I really don't care about the past--I just find it all extremely humorous, that's all. So if you're a true Playboy and a ""refugee fan"" of the seasons past... by all means... just enjoy all the new cheese of this season, the flakiness, those ANNOYING twins... and of course, the sheer nakedness anyway. ;) I know I'll probably never take the DVDs seriously--If I ever do decide to buy it. I'm satisfied with just watching Holly's show. I hope her heart can officially heal now w/out Hef's ridiculous antics he stirred up just to hurt her even more for leaving him. Holly has her justice and her victory she rightfullly deserved, and that alone also makes me happy. <3 <3 <3",1310256000,3,3998,4.369623655913978
4498402,2,B004XYABPS,"This is worst season of the series. I don't like the fact that Holly, Bridget and Kendra are on the cover and they barely appeared on the season. Also, it was boring the whole time. The girls don't have personalities: The twins are just two dumb bimbos, and Crystal is not enough to keep the series interesting as it was, they tried too hard to make her the new Holly but it didn't worked well. Overall, I prefer to believe that this season never existed...
Just don't buy this, please. Better save your money on Holly's and Kendra's spin-offs DVD's.",1307577600,50,550,4.51

If you can get past the total stuck up personalities of the twins that is! ""Transitions pts 1&2"" are definitely the highlight of the season, but as the season progresses you really grow to like Crystal and her bubbly personality and she definitely saves the show from being a total flop.

4498435,5,B004XYABPS,"I rated GND Season 6 at 5 stars because the production, directing, casting, camera work and writing of this season is every bit on par with the previous 5 seasons. Certainly Season 6 has a different feel to it since Holly, Bridget and Kendra play only somewhat modest roles; however, that does not mean cameo or insignificant roles. Those of us who have followed the first 5 seasons of GND have grown accustomed to the original ""Girls"". They were good, perhaps excellant, in their roles, very personable, talented, sexy, worthy of our sincere audience love. We learned to care about them and still do. But let's get serious about their replacements, the focus Girls of Season 6. Crystal Harris and The Twins (Karissa & Kristina Shannon) are worthy replacements; they are sexy ladies with plenty of personality. Over the last 55 years Playboy has photographed only the most beautiful women that were willing to share some of their charmes on camera. There have been some real beauties in the past, some of which continue to be much involved in The Mansion and various current activities. In phisical appearance Ms. Harris and Mses. Shannon can run with a fair number of these past race horses. The Girls of Season 6 were willing to share a significant amount of their endowments on camera.

 And, yes, things are a little different during Season 6; however, Hef plays a somewhat expanded role in order to provide continuity with previous seasons. Mary is also prominantly cast, and there are appearances by brother Kieth and previous members of the The Mansion staff. All of the key players made an excellant trip to Italy shown during the season.

A fair review of Season 6 must note that this season is shorter in comparison to its predecessors. Season 6 runs 243 minutes, while Seasons 1 through 5 run, respectively: 336 minutes, 418 minutes, 330 minutes, 379 minutes, and 390 minutes. Season 6 is published on 2 discs while the previous seasons were distributed on 3 discs.

Season 6 is challenged by the fact that it is being distributed 2 years after production, which took place during 2009. Much has happened during the 2009-2011 period. The Twins are gone from The Mansion and so is Crystal Harris, somewhat spectaclarly in her case, and we know that the likelihood of a GND Season 7 is modest at best.

Were Seasons 1-5 the best? Of course they were, for a number of reasons including 5 seasons of continuity with the same splendid cast. That doesn't make Season 6 bad or the Season 6 Girls or Hef any less charming. They did more than a decent job, folks, and many past GND fans will enjoy them.",1311638400,6,2605,4.729074889867841

8447619,5,B004XYABPS,"I bought and have watched the first three seasons of Playboys The Girls Next Door And there were some fun moments. However the three girls Holly, Bridget and Kendra did not have the chemistry of niceness that the girls of season six had.  There was a lot of catty attitude between the girls of the original cast. Kendra came across like a dumb blonde jock, she acted real juvenile and without makeup she was not attractive at all. Bridget was so blah plain I don't see how she got the part. The only girl of interest was Holly she was way prettier than the other two girls put together, and she was creative and smart.  So I can see why Hef picked her as his number one girlfriend.
In season six of TGND we are introduced to three new of Hefs girlfriends. Crystal; Hefs girlfriend number one and the two adorable ever so cute twins; Karissa Shannon, Kristina Shannon.  The twins make this season. They do most of the commentary and are such fun to watch. They are two fantasy dolls from heaven! It is a joy watching them having fun and their bubbly commentary is very entertaining.  It is fun watching them because the twins love each other and share this special love and fun with us. They go to Europe to meet their relatives or when they to Vegas to have a fun romp it is a joy to watching them.  You feel as though they are your best friends and when they are telling of how they feel and and are so honest that you really want to know them even more.

Some reviews say the new girls are catty/mean/stupid/vapid/etc. I guess I didn't see all of that. No, they are not as fun/charming as the original 3, but their comments are funny and they are entertaining and nice to look at. If you liked seasons 1-5, I think you'll like this too. Not as much, but it's still worth adding to your collection!",1475798400,,719,4.4961832061068705
