2089669,5,B0002F6BTM,"If I did not already have the season 1-5 box set and the season 6-10 box set separately, I would jump at this deal and would have saved 25 percent.  Then again, I could not wait to own this entire series.  If you are a fan of AYBS?, you are eventually going to want the whole series, so why wait?  Get it all and enjoy the 69 episodes as well as some extras now.  It's better then waiting for PBS to air them all in between fund raising telethons.  Here's all you get:

The first half of this set (volumes 1-6 with a bonus volume 7) represents the best AYBS? material with original cast members Arthur Brough (Mr. Grainger), Harold Bennett (Young Mr. Grace), Larry Martyn (Mr. Mash), and Trevor Bannister (Mr. Lucas). They include all episodes from the black & white pilot through ""It Pays to Advertise"" from season 5. Volume 2 also includes my all-time favorite AYBS? episode ""Big Brother,"" when Mr. Rumbold installs a closed circuit television in the store to uncover a burglar but instead uses it to spy on the Grace Brother's staff. The artistic details of both AYBS? sets are very nice. After choosing an episode, the elevator conductor announces the title and the lift doors open to reveal the plot.

The second half of this set (volumes 8-13 with a bonus volume 14) includes some unpopular cast changes but still offers plenty of hilarious episodes. Starting with volume 8, Mr. Grainger is replaced by a string of, mostly unmemorable, characters, and Mr. Lucas will eventually be replaced by the more mean-spirited and less tactful Mr. Spooner.  Still, more of my personal favorites are nestled within the later volumes of this set.  In ""Grounds for Divorce"" it seems almost every female member of Grace Brothers is enamored with Captain Peacock. ""The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocomb"" are about her obsession with you know who (in this case, he's not ""free""). ""The Hero"" with Capt. Peacock developing a boil on his bum is another of my favorites. It also includes Trevor Bannister's last episode ""The Punch and Judy Affair"" which, although I find to be boring and repetitive, is a fan favorite.

What I also enjoy about both DVD sets for this series are the extras in volumes 7 and 14. You get half hour bios on John Inman, Molly Sugden, and Wendy Richard. Each bio includes pre-AYBS? clips (Sugden in ""The Liver Birds,"" ""Coronation Street;"" Richard in ""The Newcomers,"" ""Hugh and I,"" ""Up Pompeii!,"" ""Dad's Army,"" etc.). In Richard's bio, there are many clips from the long-running soap opera EastEnders. They also include interview clips with Inman, Bannister, Frank Thornton, Richard, and Sugden as well as others that look like they were recorded fairly recently. ""The Best of..."" extra on volume 14 was disappointing. I thought John Inman would provide commentary to AYBS? clips. Actually, it is just a bunch of random clips (some quite long) that any fan of AYBS? has seen many times before. The piece on Molly Sugden looked as if it was going to be the same clip show but, fortunately, ends up with more interviews with actors and a look at Sugden's life in her own words which makes for a very welcomed extra. The first episode of Grace and Favour is also included and I recommend picking up the DVD with all the episodes of this cute series that is now available. This series was great, and ""I am unanimous in that.""",1102809600,119,3328,4.683219178082192

2089727,3,B0002F6BTM,"The program rates a 4 or 5, but the disks themselves rate only a 1 or 2, so I gave it 5.
The data on Amazon lists it as ""subtitled for the hearing impared"", the box has the subtitles list as ""Closed Captioned"", the CC symbol is also on the box, and each disk has the CC symbol on the front.
However, there is no CC or subtitles of any kind.  I have 4 different brands of players that work fine on other dicks listed as CC (except season 1 of ""The Good Life"", another DVD set to avoid.
Because the sound quality is not very good (think the production values of the first few years of Dr. Who"") captions are essential to understand some of the dialog, especially the young sales girl.  She apparently has many of the best lines, but I do not have a clue what she said,- except for one episode where she pretends to be a high society lady when her diction is perfect.

God I didn't like it the first time I saw it and god bless patience because each time I saw it after that I learned to love the characters and feel like I knew them more to enjoy the humor. The double entendre humor is at a level you'll never see on regular tv. And with episodes only running a little less than 30 minutes so easy to sit down and enjoy a good laugh quickly.

When we originally received the discs, they were fine for the first play-through. They discs were handled gently and replaced in the cases as soon as they were removed from the DVD player. After finishing the series, the entire set sat on the shelf for a couple of years. When I wanted to start watching the shows again, I was dismayed to find that disc after disc had problems. Ranging from glitchy playback to discs that simply wouldn't play anymore, the poor quality of this product was extremely disappointing.

2090050,5,B0002F6BTM,"A great cast (for the most part), plenty of running gags (Mrs. Slocombes pussy-cat Tiddles), fabulous characters (the ambiguous Mr. Humphries who is described as being neither here nor there), all make this an enduring classic.  Its fun, its familiar humor is well appreciated, and it can be watched endlessly without growing tiresome.  Ive lost track of the number of times Ive watched this series.

I am disappointed though that one of its creators, David Croft, has stated that Mr. Humphries was not a homosexual, despite all the humor indicating he was.  Croft insists that Mr. Humphries was just a mothers boy.  At a time when it would have been helpful to have a gay icon in popular culture, it feels like a betrayal having Mr. Humphries (played by an openly gay actor John Inman) reinterpreted to avoid any misunderstanding (appearances can be misleading?).

Made in England in the mid 1970's through early 1980's the show's main characters stayed together throughout. This set is very nice, with the episodes in chronological order, followed by a set of interview and post series specials. One disk is the John Inman specials seen on PBS, the other has interviews of Wendy Richards, and several of Mollie Sugden. The last one follows Mollie as she's a great grandmother, still as sharp as ever, and meeting some of the surviving cast members at a family reunion.

2090159,5,B0002F6BTM,"Having just been introduced to this show recently by my boyfriend, I snagged him this set so we could watch the whole series together. While the box that houses the DVD cases is quite flimsy, the slim cases themselves are very well made, and contrary to other reviews, they hold the discs very well. The DVD menus are quite comprehensive and make it really easy to navigate the series from start to finish, or to simply find your favorite episodes. Film masters must not exist, because these DVD's were obviously remastered from videotape. But that being said, this is probably the best the show has ever looked and will ever look. We found that turning on the ""Cinema"" picture setting on our 4K LG OLED TV warmed up the picture perfectly and made it look just like it did when it originally aired. The standard picture setting was way too bright and not only washed out the colors immensely, but put every DVD compression anomaly under a magnifying glass. So toggle your picture presets and find one like ""Movie"" or ""Cinema"", it will really make the discs look their best.",1450742400,4,1073,4.652631578947369
2090160,5,B0002F6BTM,"I watched this series when I was younger as it came on KLRN in the states. The quality then was not great since this show was older even then at the age that I became a fan of it, so I'm sure without it being remastered it is going to be a rough quality compared to HD that people are so use to now a days.

I have not purchased this specific item but I have loved the show and all of it's characters over the years.

For the crazy sad reviews on how offensive this show is, I would suggest if you think this show is offensive then how do you survive even browsing through the internet or watching shows or movies that come out now a days. This show is practically G rated compared to what is out there now or language in music. Someone had commented that characters in this show talk about underwear/knickers and to be honest they sell clothes, in a clothing store (oh how shocking). Any clothing store sells underwear so the fact that you find that strange or offensive, just blows my mind.

Those who are a fan of this show know already what they are in store for as to the language used on this show, and for those of you who are not familiar with English/British terms, may be *offended* by what they hear if you are highly sensitive and have never seen this show before. Terms used by them are different from what we consider them, especially during the era this show is taking place. I'd suggest if you do not know what you are getting into with this DVD maybe try to find some clips of the show first that are available online before buying, so you don't waste other peoples times with negative reviews .

If you are a fan of Monty Python, then this show will not offend you.

The humor is a bit risque and requires perfect timing to let the humor sing. These actors makes this show special. Mollie Sugden (Mrs. Slocombe) is a master of comedy and can deliver the most outrageous lines as if she was the most proper grande dame.  It was the Australian version uses almost the same script, however, that gave me a better appreciation of the supporting cast.  Without Frank Thornton (Captain Peacock) and Wendy Richards (Miss Brahms), the characters became dull.

The savvy direction also deserves a nod. John Inman's (Mr. Humphries) performance in the Australian version brings out the contrast. Timing and delivery in the Australian version simply fails to be funny.  The timing of the British comedy is spot on.

Nicholas Smith (Cuthbert Rumbold) said in a documentary on the show that viewers often commented that the characters were such good friends.  He rightly pointed out that in the show they did not play friends. I agree. Instead, they were friends in real life and chimed together on set.  They were a good team, and they made a brilliant show.

2090195,5,B0002F6BTM,"If you have never seen the Brit comedies then you should order this set of Are You Being Served?. Outstanding writing and producing along with very memorable characters, these are the comedies of times gone by.
I might suggest that you may order a single edition before investing in the entire series to get you started. The shows are fast moving and the plots vary with a lot of hints of near vulgar monologue, but in a extremely funny way. (you have to judge that in your mind).
Very well laid out series with a little information about the Characters and their pasts in one of the disks, and a little on screen preview both in words and bits of preview of the show.",1445299200,,668,4.395161290322581

Been watching on the PBS britcom suit for over 20 years, including Keeping Up Appearances, As Time Goes By and Doc Martin.  Sadly they do not play in Chicago as we just moved here, so we decided to buy the Are You Neing Served  set.  It never gets old with its dry humor and sublinal jokes.  We now have our Saturday nights back with a cup of tea and biscuits.  Nice set and the restoration is awsome, picture quality and sound are a amazing.  Great price too.

2090565,5,B0002F6BTM,"My all time favorite Britcom...  I've seen them a hundred times, and have never stopped loving them!
I used to keep them on constant rotation in my DVD player and simply follow the last disk of the series with the first again...  I've not found the series available online, and am Glad to know I've got the set on hard copy myself!

I watched the show every time I found it online, but found the complete series interesting in the ability it gave to see the slow progression of characters as the series went on...  some people go after years, some people are only there for a short time...  I mostly liked seeing how Mr Harman began as a side character, and eventually grew to be a replacement for the original character, lost after a very long run...

I enjoyed the variations and amazing diversity of story they managed to pull off in a show where they NEVER DO ACTUALLY LEAVE THE STORE!!  and the double entendre never really loses its cheeky smirk-inducing qualities...

Interestingly, tho I'd seen it on PBS for years, there were a couple of episodes I had NEVER Seen on this Dvd set...  for obvious reasons eventually...  and it's interesting to see how, what is really a very progressive show, still had its moments of situational prejudice...  (you think rather a lot after watching it an 'undred times...)

A classic, I will enjoy watching well into my dotage...

From the first, ""Captain Peacock, are you available?"" to the ending credits you just have to watch and see what happens next. A good amount of this show can be seen in the modern comedies of the 90s and 2000s, and is greatly missing today. Just good clean (sometimes) humor with a great cast of characters that seem to enjoy one another. My wife was extremely excited to have this as a gift as the DVR we had them on went down.

But the show ended up losing focus on Lucas and ended up being about the entire department store floor itself-much to the disappointment of the actor who played Lucas, who was supposed to be the star.  The show concentrated on jokes about malfunctioning store displays, selling shoddy merchandise (""It will ride up with wear!""), infighting between the staff, and dealing with the elderly ""young Mr. Grace"", and succeeded in that.  But as the show went on, several actors left and their roles were taken over by less suited actors, and everything eventually fizzled out.

Amazon agreed to and did send out a second set of disks. But, these too were Region 2 disks. Both sets of disks said BBB America, but they had Region 2 noted on them.

I was very disappointed as ""Are You Being Served?"" is one of my favorite television shows and this was offered at a great deal on Amazon's Gold deal offers. But, if it doesn't play on your DVD player then it is too expensive no matter how low the cost.

So, my rating of one star does not reflect the content of the video, but rather that the two sets of disks sent were unplayable.",1407456000,11,805,4.01875
2090727,4,B0002F6BTM,"This show belongs in the pantheon of British comedy legends for many reasons: the excellent cast of true characters, the classically farcical situations, and the ingenious sight-gags and brilliant double-entendre dialogue by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft that makes me break out in giggles when Mrs. Slocombe complains ""This sort of thing isn't easy on my pussy"".
For ten series, the staff of the mens and womens clothing sections in Grace Brother's Department Store spar, share, and work together.  This is a major ensemble show, but because this is a light comedy show, there isn't a whole lot of depth to the cast: they are as they appear.  Mrs. Slocombe is all dignified ridiculousness, Captain Peacock is haughty pomposity, Mr. Humphries is impishly camp (despite the writers constant denial that he was gay, one can't help but leave with the impression he has to be at least a closeted homosexual), Mr. Lucas is cheeky and lecherous, Mr. Rumbold is well-meaning and clueless, Mr. Granger is cantankerous dignity, while Miss Brahms (in my opinion the weakest character) is an airhead pretty girl with a bit of an edge to her.
In a way the limited scope of plots and character development is part of what makes this an enjoyable show... you shouldn't expect anything of these characters except to make you laugh and they usually deliver in full measure.  I can break the show down into a few phases: the best years were series 1-5 when the original cast was intact, then Mr. Granger was quietly dropped (the actor playing him died but this show practiced the infuriating habit of never explaining why we never see characters after they leave, and over ten years several characters came and went).  Series 6 and 7 were ok, but when Mr. Lucas' character was written out after series 7 (again practically unexplained), it starts to feel the core of the show is lost and that which made it so funny begins to feel repetitious, with the plots becoming more and more outlandish in it's last three years.
Still, we have here the most perfect specimen of British comedy/farce.  It has been a huge hit here in America for many years and belongs with the other greats.  We are served... with laughter and fun for everyone!",1407369600,,2215,4.800524934383202

2090784,5,B0002F6BTM,"Unless you are living on another planet and never heard of PBS TV, you must have watched at least one episode of Are You Being Served? It was, hands down, the funniest, most loved and revered, and longest running comedy on British TV. Its plot revolved around an aging department store and its inept management. Its Men and Women departments are thrown together on the same floor and must share, or should I say, compete with each other for floor space and customers. Its employees are an odd lot of characters whose various personalities clash with riotous results. That, coupled with a woman chasing octogenarian owner and a department manager who, though well intended, hasn't a clue how to manage successfully, promises hours of laughs and entertainment.

What originally aired as a B&W pilot and schedule filler turned into a long running comedy of several years. The success of the series was due to its brilliant writing, and the cadre of hand picked, ""seasoned"" professionals who knew how to embellish a script to fit its characters.

If you watched the series repeatedly over these many decades on Public TV, then you have already fallen in love with it and its characters. I adore good comedy and have a DVD collection of more than 2500 titles. It would not have been complete without Are You Being Served?, and its redux one season series, Are You Being Served? - Again (aka Grace and Favour).

For some reason, my DVDs of U.S. films/series don't seem to have this problem with ""separation"" or as it's sometimes called, ""heat damage.""  Anyway, there's little recourse for this issue, so in the end, this caused me to purchase this set over again, and for the price, I wasn't disappointed (and hopefully the discs are of higher manufactured quality than the previous release).

There is nothing different content-wise between this set and the previously released collection.  You will enjoy the lower cost and the space-saving packaging!",1372118400,,650,5.161904761904762

As my sister observed, it is rare that a show can make us laugh out loud so consistently.  The shipper got the set to us a little early in perfect condition.  We will probably just start over when we run out of discs!",1372118400,,380,3.896103896103896

The Brits seem to cast people who might look like their role, not just another pretty face (except for a couple of ""secretary"" roles).  The result is a fine ensemble that play well off each other.  Most of the original main characters are now deceased, but it is a tribute to their skills that people today still enjoy their work.  The complete collection allows us to watch episodes we might have missed and revisit ones we found particularly funny.  It's worth every penny!  A perfect ending for an imperfect day...guaranteed to make you laugh and brighten your spirits.  No wonder it was a hit for such a long time.",1369440000,,698,4.626016260162602

2091082,5,B0002F6BTM,"I only ever saw a few of the original broadcasts of Are You Being Served, and they were hilarious. The innuendo is typical British and probably incomprehensible to the uninitiated American public. The Aussies love it. But once you have absorbed the culture, you will be hooked. Many of the episodes are predictable, but always manage to hold a surprise here and there. Each of the regular characters is developed well, and meet both stereotypical expectations and then jolt you out of comfort with totally unexpected zingers.

The first few episodes lack the clarity of the later episodes, no doubt due to the age of the film. The 4:3 display is at first a disappointment, but then we are talking of vintage series before widescreen TV was even thought about.

If you are a British Comedy aficionado, then you already know about this series, so why haven't you bought it yet. If you are new to British Comedy, jump in now.",1368057600,2,922,4.720496894409938

Old Mr. Grace was the original owner.  This show still comes on here in America on PBS on Sunday night (where I live).

2091234,4,B0002F6BTM,"This long running British tv series perhaps has been more adored by American PBS watchers than BBC watchers! It's a quirky sitcom with no superb acting & very contrived scripts, but that part of it's charm! It tells the story of employees at a store called Grace Brothers that have to share a space now because women's wear has moved to the same floor as men's wear, much to everyone's dismay! The main ""floor"" characters consist of two established employees who seem to really go at each other. A young, pretty, inexperienced woman's wear assistant, and two men's wear assistants who play off each other wonderfully and get a lot of laughs. Lastly, the every present ""floor walker"" who sits on his high horse only to have his pompous self knocked down often! The supporting cast includes the very elderly store owner who hires sexy nurses and secretaries to send him in to heart malfunctions often. There's the sometimes cranky & often foolish manager and the custodian who manages to cause trouble often and usually on purpose. One thing I've enjoyed is the 6 main ""floor employees"" were portrayed by the same actors for many years except for a quick change of cast for two. Because it was on the air for so many years you enjoy watching the cast develop their characters and age as they would if you were going to the Grace Brothers to be served. My husband and I used to watch the sitcom every night and after the years have passed still use the lines from the show, such as ""it'll ride up with wear"". The answer they always gave the customer when trying clothes on that were too long. (It's where I also learned about Paddington Bear and picked up some British slang!) This is a lighthearted show that's easy on the grey matter and very enjoyable. Since many Americans don't know understand British humour is, thinking Benny Hill which is not accurate especially now, should watch an episode or two on Amazon's Instant Videos before committing to a who series. Or perhaps a season would be best which is quite affordable on Amazon! This show is cherished by my family for a good laugh after a hard day!!",1355702400,,2108,4.624

2091261,5,B0002F6BTM,"At first glance it seems like a simple, congenial sitcom set in some retail store, but this is a very complex rendering of the human condition with many of the strengths and weaknesses we all possess. The social thinking and subtle nuances within this group's relationships, is a mirror of all of us in our own working environments.
The ranking, the envy, the fear, the kissing-up, the arrogance and the back-stabbing are all playing along with the basic goodness, acceptance and sense of humor we all have.

The dialogue and general situations are not only funny but also characteristic of the retail trade, which I am a bit familiar with. The selling, the over-selling and the lying to the un-assuming customer, they all make an excellent case for the best comedy. Whatever the fit of the garment be sure `it will ride up with wear'... the same refrain as the `everything will be ok'... even in the obviously hopeless cases.

What brings it all together with the writing and the directing, is the brilliant performance of the cast.  Each actor becomes his or her character in the most convincing and humorous way.
I love British comedy, I have many shows I watch over and over, but this one remains one of my most favorites. It could also be because I see more than a sitcom in these shows. They are painting the tedium of life in a colorful, bearable and most human way even when it's just trivial gossip.

These were times when being social meant being together and participating at life in an office or a store, talking to each other and getting involved.

All the episodes through the 13-year run are equally well made even with the changing of some characters. It's definitely worth having and watching if you love British humor.",1352246400,11,1736,4.697368421052632

2091289,5,B0002F6BTM,"We all have our guilty pleasures which we enjoy secretly while knowing that we should be more grown-up than to indulge ourselves. One of mine (no, I'm not telling you the others!) is AYBS? It's the most simple and unsophisticated humor, full of double entendres and cheap laughs. It works because the cast put it across so well, especially Mollie Sugden and John Inman as the single middle-aged lady and the man who is neither one way nor the other respectively.

Don't watch this in order to elevate your mind. It's just basic fun with no message or subtlety. Forget your political correctness and let yourself be entertained. If you want to know the type of humor in the show, I can't do better than quote John Inman (this isn't in the set, so it's not a spoiler). He was asked which of Mrs. Slocombe's various hair colors he preferred and replied ""I don't mind what color her hair is, as long as it matches her (insert colloquial name for cat here)!""

This set has all the episodes from the original AYBS?, plus the first episode of the sequel 'Are You Being Served Again'. (The two series that were made of AYBSA?, some 10 years later, are well worth getting separately.) There are also interviews and specials about the show. Sadly, almost all the cast are gone now; the charm of the series has outlasted its actors. This set is a great memorial for them.",1338422400,,1360,4.546938775510204

Other British comedies I suggest you try are ""As time goes by"".

The aspect I had not realised back then was the satirical accuracy of the workplace and the archetypal characters within. Workplaces I remember back in the sixties and seventies all seemed to have a frustrated Mrs Slocombe, a pompous Captain Peacock, a thick-as-two-planks boss like Mr Rumbold and a doddery, ineffectual Mr Grace at the top.

While I obviously have no complaints about the episodes themselves, the DVD set does have a couple of deficiencies.  First, the pilot episode is still only in a black-and-white kinescope; even though the BBC has since restored the pilot's original color, this has not yet been made available on DVD.  Second, the DVD menus are cumbersome, with the unavoidable animation needless and unnecessary.  Moreover, it is not possible to quickly change selection between episodes without having to endure this animation.  Lastly, the bonus features on the 12 episode discs are repetitive and limited, though the two remaining bonus discs contain well-produced programs by PBS and the BBC.  Any fan of the series, and of British comedy in general, will be glad to own this set containing the crown jewels of British television, and the DVD's deficiencies pale in comparison to the many hours of enjoyment one will get watching the episodes.",1323648000,,1184,5.172774869109948

2091379,5,B0002F6BTM,"20 years ago when I was in Jr High school, I remember flipping through channels and finding this show on PBS. I remember the first time I stopped to see what it was. It was Mrs. Slocombe's wildly dyed hair that caught my eye. ""What was a woman in her 50's doing with pink hair?"", I remember thinking to myself. It didn't matter, from that point on I was hooked.

I would take blank VHS tapes and every time I would catch an episode on TV I would record it. I ended up with a stack of 30+ tapes filled with episodes, all out of order and often repeats. I watched those tapes so often they eventually wore out.

I was beyond thrilled with I discovered they put the whole series into a DVD collection. I was so excited when I found there were even 2 episodes from the last season of the series I had never even seen!

All the characters play fun and unique rolls. While the shows setting is almost always the exact same (a department store) the actors are so strong and the dialogue is so witty, it shows just how great a program with outstanding writer and actors can be.

2091415,5,B0002F6BTM,"Are You Being Served(AYBS)which ran from 1972 to 1985,certainly has to go down as one of the BBC's biggest television sitcom triumphs ever. This rather ordinary setting in an old style English department store was populated with some of the most eccentric but lovable characters you would ever find on TV anywhere.
Mrs Slocombe(Mollie Sugden)whose hairstyle/colour changed as often as the weather. Her catch phrases were,among others,""weak as water"",when referring to the men. When she wanted to emphasize a statement she would say""...and I am unanimous in that..."".
Miss. Brahms(Wendy Richards)was Mrs. Slocombe's assistant in the womens wear department,whose cockney accent and less than stellar mind,would sometimes rate an admonishment from Mrs. Slocombe in the form of""That will all,Miss Brahms"".
Mr. Peacock(Frank Thornton)whose pompous attitude and sarcasm/stares as the stores floorwalker were something else to behold. He was always berating the maintenance staff for being on the floor during open hours.
Mr. Grainger(Arthur Brough)was the oldest and most crotchety man on the floor and senior salesman in the mens wear department. He seem to be doing a constant reprising of Winston Churchill. If trouble arose for him it was always""...a glass of water for Mr Grainger"".
Mr. Humphries(John Inman)was the effeminate/mama's boy who never left home. He was second behind Mr. Grainger. When Capt. Peacock would glance his way with""Are you free,Mr. Humphries"",an inevitably alone Mr. Humphries would respond""Yes,I am free"" and do his famous quick walk over to the Captain.
Mr. Lucas(Trevor Bannister) was the young assistant to Mr Humphries,and he always had a comeback,especially towards Mrs. Slocombe.
Mr. Rumbold(Nicholas Smith)was the Mickey Mouse eared boss of all(next of course behind the young Mr Grace,the owner).He would steal others suggestions for his own and was sometimes hard to get a point through to;in other words,pretty thick.
This cornucopia of characters,along with so many other memorable ones,with all their foibles and quirks were quite lovable and one could easily empathize with them as they all had their feet firmly based in reality;the cornerstone of good comedy.
Technically speaking the shows(all 69 eps on 14 discs,two in one slip case)have been transferred wonderfully. The only glitch in the set that I found was on the ep ""Pop Star"".During the beginning music it suddenly stalls(stuck on one note)for two or three seconds then continues. The film itself is still moving so it is either a glitch from the original film master or something from the transfer. Along with the 69 eps are the original pilot. Also are some wonderful extras on the two end discs. They contain featurettes on three of its main stars,the best of AYBS,a AYBS special starring Inman playing Mr Humphries and his mother and ep#1 from Grace and Favour,the sequel series to AYBS.Along with many of the earlier eps comes some trivia about each and each ep features a lead in from a closing and opening elevator door,with the title of the ep being spoken. There is a lexicon of sorts included for those who don't quite get all of the English phraseology.
All in all a highly recommended box set of one of the funniest BBC shows ever to air. Some of the funniest double entendre's,farce and even slapstick will have you laughing out loud as you watch them. Highly Recommended.
FYI- Out of most of the main cast only Frank Thornton(Mr Peacock) and Nicholas Smith(Mr. Rumbold) are still with us as of this writing.",1307836800,,3519,5.197183098591549

Ms Slocombe who is single and is not aging gracefully.  Mr Humphries who is gay, however, he never really admitts to it.  Mr Granger who is so funny.  Mr Lucas who gets around with the ladies.  Then there is Captain Peacock who is a bit snooty but who gets about with the ladies & is married as well and so does young Mr Grace.

This is a cleverly done show. Innuendo and sly remarks abound to draw the viewer in and laugh out loud. British television doesn't have to be profane or specific to be funny and this is a true example of how they do it.
The actors all work well together and one can see the chemistry abound. It is no wonder this show aired on BBC for so long and why it continues to captivate viewers here across the pond, years after its end.
This complete collection contains 14 discs that contain all 69 episodes of the series and DVD extras. For those wondering, it does not include the movie or the Christmas special, as the other one for sale on Amazon does, which probably explains the price difference and difference of features between the two. The quality of the DVD's is well done and nothing to complain about.",1300233600,4,962,4.320441988950276

2091434,5,B0002F6BTM,"It really says something when the humor is just as good today as it was when the series were shot... The actors and roles in the cast are all distinctively different and they all combine so well for really funny situations. Add to that the great English used (wow.. no ""like""!!) and all you can do during this show is smile, laugh and laugh some more... The humor is from situations, fantastic reactions to sarcasm, which is sometimes really sophisticated and veiled, plus the ""clash"" between the social classes, which itself is quite harmless at the end of the day.
Bottom line: timeless quality sophisticated humor... One only wishes that one's workplace would be remotely as fun as theirs...

The b/w version was a copy of the original color transmitted show sold to overseas stations and actually still contained the original color signal embeded within the film. By a new process the film was able to be fully restored to color.

What a pleasant surprise to find the entire collection of episodes plus extensive interviews with the cast that were done before Mollie Sugden's and Wendy Richards' deaths. The interviews with and documentaries of the cast members are on Volume 7 of this set.

Are You Being Served is a classic sitcom, filled with laughter, innuendo and one-liners that made the players famous. Sugden's famous (or infamous as the case may be) lines about her [...] (cat), Tiddles are all here and still funny no matter how many times I watch the episodes.

So what's new?  Just ONE thing:  the packaging.  This set takes up MUCH less room on your shelf than the old collection (it's about 2 inches wide).  Everything else is the same as far as I can tell... the dvd's are exact copies of what was already released (I was kinda hoping for less annoying menus, oh well).

One minor problem is with the slim double-DVD cases: they don't hold the discs in place securely, and discs will often fall out when opening the case.

So the verdict?  If you like ""Are You Being Served?"" and don't already own the collection, this is a very good deal... I paid much more for this set several years back.  Do you already own the older set?  Then stick with it, unless the shelf space that it takes up is driving you crazy.",1250208000,433,963,4.259668508287293

2091599,5,B0002F6BTM,"I discovered AYBS on a PBS station during law school.  It was a pleasant, homey program that greatly helped me unwind at bedtime (no mean feat, at the time) so I could eventually fall asleep.  I don't want to imply that it's like a sleeping pill-- it's more like a massage.

No sitcoms make me roar with laughter every minute (MST3K came closest, alhough categorizing that as a sitcom, or anything else, is problematic); but, the good ones brighten my mood, especially when the characters come to feel like welcome, comforting, old friends, and I'll always have a warm feeling from seeing the core cast.  John Inman as Mr. Humphries is among my fondest characters from any program, anywhere.

The jokes are often pretty silly or over-the-top, making ""The Andy Griffith Show"" seem like ""COPS.""  You come to anticipate the reactions of each character to a given situation with certainty; but, as many reviews will attest, that is something people who like this show enjoy.  I wouldn't quite say that this show is like crossing ""The Office"" with ""Gilligan's Island;"" but, it's tempting (never moreso than when you encounter the ""Guatemalan monkey"").  If I did, I'd say the watchability greatly favored the former parent.  Even though I could see many jokes coming a mile away, they were often done so outrageously that they still sometimes surprised me the first time through.  I found it interesting how the British were prepared (rarely) to make jokes based on cringingly erroneous ethnic stereotypes that wouldn't have been tolerated here in the U.S. decades earlier; and double entendres abound that might have pushed a very mild, harmless program into a later time slot here.

When some original cast members had to leave for one reason or another (death being a common one), their replacements had a hard time filling the shoes of their predecessors; but, I'm grateful that they kept the series going as best they could.  Even new cast members contributed to some memorable moments.

Unfortunately, I've had horrendous luck with BBC Video quality control with every set I've ever bought, and I'm running into similar problems with the box set of ""Only Fools and Horses,"" also from BBC Video.  The entire current batch of AYBS Disc 11's appears to be corrupt in the same place based on 3 sets I tried (look for it in ""The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocombe;"" if yours doesn't start tiling, dropping sound, and generally just becoming a mess when she discusses getting a chip caught in her throat the previous night out with Mrs. Axelby, I envy your good luck).  The second and third sets had a slightly defective Disc 12, as well (I couldn't have known it, but, I should have quit while I was ahead).  Amazon has suspended sales pending correction of the disc defects. I strongly recommend watching any BBC Video release entirely before the inspection period expires if you much mind defective discs; and, I urge you to buy multi-volume sets from sellers like Amazon who can easily replace defective sets, and let you pick out a single set of least-corrupt discs from two sets of mixed quality before you have to send one set back.  Even when I've had to pay a bit more to buy from Amazon, the customer service has made the investment well worthwhile, especially on large, multi-disc sets where the odds favor the occasional bad disc.",1211587200,4,3332,4.827768014059754

As an American who grew up on Taxi, Three's Company, Laverne and Shirley, etc., I can honestly say that AYBS is one of the GREATS and can hold its own against any American sitcom.

My only complaint is that so few episodes were made! What were they thinking? Thirteen years and ONLY 69 episodes? In the U.S. that amount of time would have generated around 250-300 epsodes! A shame that such a PERFECT cast wasn't given the chance to entertain us at least a few more times per year.

Your about to enter Grace Brothers. Where you will meet Mr. Humphries, Mr. Grainger, Capt. Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Lucas, Mr. Grace, Mr. Rumbold, Miss Brahms, Mr. Mash, Mr. Harman, and many more.

Some of the later episodes I don't like. After Mr. Granger left (Arthur Burrow (I cant spell) passed away) It kinda got worse. Mr. Tebbs was okay. And I hated Goldberg. But it wasn't too bad. But after Mr. Lucas was gone it was just awful. I mean Mr. Spooner was just so so you know awful. I have nothing against Mike Berry his music is great (especially his album A Tribute to Buddy Holly). But his character is just bad. I just don't like him.

My favourite episode is A Good Change is a rest (The One where they had to go work in the Toy Department). It was the first episode I saw. And I still love it to this day.

In Case anyone didn't know a couple months ago John Inman (Mr. Humphries)

died. I don't know how old he was but it really sucks that hes dead. He was a really good actor.

Oh ya I was gonna mention about the controversy about Are You Being Served. OK for all you people who are upset about Mr. Humphries. You know being gay. Hes not. It never said he is. The laugh Track. Its a real audience. So the producers didn't say when the laughs were. And Mrs. Slocombs cat. Well lets just say if you think the jokes are nasty in this show then you have a sick mind. If you think about it its only your mind that thinks they are nasty.

Ladies Intimate Appearl headed by Ms Betty Slocumbe a nice enough lady who at least understands the needs of the posh classes enough to sell to them but a lady equally at home on a bar stool in a trucker or biker bar as you will find out.  Ms. Brahms a brassy young thing who is not just common but some would say dead common or common as muck, with her heavy East End of London accent as second string in the ladies department she adds a bit of spice to all the upper crust goings on.

For the men there were a succession of players as the turn over in the Men's Ready Made Area was higher during the shows run.  Two who stayed was the man in the Middle Mr. Claybourne Wilburforce Humpries a dandy foppish fellow in his fine taylored suits by day and wild life by night.  Mr Humphries sometimes came in dressed in ways that told tales that could easily set the heart crossways within you.  Mr. Humphries tape measure in hand was always at the ready to take your inside leg measurements.  He was a man who at middle age still lived with his mother who lives quite an exciting life if Mr Humphries stories do her justice.

There is Mr Lucas a skirt chasing dog wrapped in the every so thin vaneer of a gentleman but only while a paying Grace Bros customer is within range.  Mr. Lucas is a nice enough sort but his commissions are always stay low because, his eyes are on the ladies figures not the sales figures.

There is the referee of this wild bunch floor walker Captain Peacock a very important man at Grace Bros but only if you count being ""Self Important"".  Captain Peacock who served in the military in the Big War WW2 is at the very bottom rung of Grace Bros, Middle Management with desires to move higher.  Captain Peacosk is not just a dog he is an old dog who can see a woman a mile away on a cloudy day and from further still if he is near an open window.  If you could buy Captain Peacock for what you end up thinking he is worth and sell him at what he thinks he is worth you would be far richer than Bill Gates himself at the end of the transaction.

Mr. Cusbert Rumbold is sort of the director of operations for the floor, you must remember department stores of quality had layers of middle management during this era.  Anyways before meeting Mr. Cusbert Rumbold on Are You Being Served I did not know what a Toby Jug was now I do.  Look at the man's ears for goodness sake his humorous value to the show is built in.

There is sweet kind if brusk and a tad common voice of the working man, in support staff worker Mr Harman whose appearance on the floor during store opening hours sends Mrs Slocumbe and Captain Peacock into a warp driven tizzy.  There are some floor displays that will just blow you away with their odd ball humorous charm.  The real secret to are you being served is almost everything said in the show has a dual meaning, one clean and another that is slightly less wholesome.  Mrs Slocumbe has a pet cat, she adores and she never fails to tell you of all the high life and drama she has at home with her Pussy named Tittles.

Then there is Mr Grace.  An old but lovable man clinging to life by a thread thinner than the fleeting trail left by a tired electron as it circles its atoms nucleas.  Mr Grace still loves the ladies but alas is too feeble to act on any of his desires leaving him fun but harmless.  He is funny in his own right as he brings a certain depth and old world charm to the role it would not have had without his efforts.

Remember the flagship item on offer at any old line department store after all was Service, Service Service along with knowledge of products.  With Are You Being Served its not like an on location store where things look way real.  The stories are tame, relics of their times 1973 to the early 80's.  The in store sets are only barely believable sort of like the old Doctor Who Sets.  But you do not buy or enjoy Are You Being Served for the authenticity of the sets or cutting edge storylines.  Are You Being Served provides you comedy that is second to none a task it still delivers does with vigor and power despite its age.  I give Are You Being served 5 stars only because, I can not give it more.  If you love british comedy you must have Are You Being Served in your collection it is one of the staples and for its price of the complete set a pretty good value.

Enjoy I brought it so I will be too!",1145923200,8,4882,4.198497854077253

My friends (including my girlfriend)don't understand why I would pay that much money for these old shows, but I happen to think they are hilarious. I watched my first episode on PBS late one evening about 5 years ago and have been hooked ever since. I was first introduced to British humor back in the 80's when ""The Young Ones"" aired on MTV. One thing about Americans watching BBC comedies, either you get it or you don't. Definitely worth purchasing and highly recommended. The DVD's have extras that explain certain things that happened on the show. It also contains bios of individuals that appeared on the show.

2091728,5,B0002F6BTM,"I am an American, I was born in America and have always lived in America. I grew up watching sitcoms like Full House, The Cosby Show, Saved By The Bell, The Wonder Years, and Three's Company. Not until just this year have I even seen a BBC sitcom. I have always totally adored British accents and loved the way the British talk and have always found England to be so much better than the U.S. as far as artistic architecture and the way they design the interior of buildings just from what I've seen and read. But I never knew how the British sitcoms were until just a few months ago.

I was at a friends' house and we were watching these British sitcoms and Are You Being Served? came on and it was so funny when I saw Mrs. Slocombe staying in this ""apartment"" in the department store and she was going to be with Mr. Humphries after the lights went out and people kept coming in her ""apartment"" and 2 of the guys had to stay in one bed and I was just totally cracking up!! Then the very last thing Mrs. Slocombe says before the credits that I'll never forget, ""Mr. Humphries, Leave My P***y Alone!"" I was just totally rolling on the floor after that. I HAD to buy that episode on DVD and I just got Vol 9 last week and I just totally love this show!! Mr. Humphries and Mrs. Slocombe are just amazing and hilarious!! Since I've seen this episode which is called The Apartment, I have watched many other episodes on PBS and I crack up everytime!! I do plan to own every episode on DVD one day!

Another favorite that I also started watching is Keeping Up Appearances and I really wish that was still showing as well. And for years I've heard of Judi Dench and just recently started watching As Time Goes By as well. Judi Dench is also amazing. I really love these British sitcoms so much especially Keeping Up Appearances and Are You Being Served? and now all I can do is watch the DVD's or see re-runs on PBS. I really do wish that they would return Are You Being Served? because in my opinion, it beats any American sitcom any day!! I didn't realize what I've been missing all these 26 years of living, living in the U.S. but now that I've discovered the British way of sitcoms, I'll never turn back!!!",1120608000,7,2204,4.2829736211031175
2091729,5,B0002F6BTM,"I have enjoyed ""Are You Being Served"" since 1987, when I first discovered it on my PBS affiliate in Tempe, Arizona. The wit, the warmth of the characters and the actors who played them hooked me from the very start.

At the time I was working at Dillard's Department Store, at the Metrocenter Mall. Ten years of ""serving"" leads me to believe that this delightful and silly show was the product of intensive research, including the use of hidden cameras. That is what I like best about ""Are You Being Served"" - the way it gently poked fun at and paid tribute to those men and women who do try to serve their customers with a smile, the professionals of the distributive trade. I only wished Mr. Humphries had worked in my department; I could have used the laughs.

If you enjoy good British comedy that is gentle and generous in spirit, give this a try.",1118707200,3,852,4.455128205128205
2091730,5,B0002F6BTM,"I love the show, and watching an episode a day never gets old. My husband, who was unfamiliar with British comedies, loves it too. The humor is not too dry or off-beat. I still laugh hysterically at every episode. Probably one of my favorite of all time.",1106784000,4,254,4.425531914893617
2091731,5,B0002F6BTM,"Ten series of this classic Britcom were produced between 1973-1985, and all sixty-nine 30-minute episodes, including the black-and-white pilot and the Christmas specials (positioned chronologically in the order originally broadcast), are here in one boxed set.

The series revolves around the staff of Grace Brothers' Department Store--particulary the staff of menswear and ladieswear.  The ladies' department is headed by the pompous, air-assuming Mrs. Slocombe (Mollie Sugden).  She's a bit of a man eater (or would be could she get her hands on one!) and is forever fretting about Tiddles, her pussy--cat that is!  Her junior is sexy Miss Brahms (Wendy Richard), who is constantly fighting off the advances of the menswear junior, Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister, who left the show after series seven due to a scheduling conflict).  From series eight on, Mr. Spooner (Mike Berry--a former singer) takes over as the new menswear junior, flirting with Miss Brahms and insulting Mrs. Slocombe at every opportunity!  The menswear department is headed by curmudgeonly old Mr. Grainger (Arthur Brough, who died (aged 73) following series five).  In between him and Mr. Lucas is the flamboyant Mr. Humphreys (John Inman).  With his mincing gait, outrageous costumes, and familiar cry of ""I'm free,"" he's my personal favourite--though the whole cast really is terrific!

Of course one cannot forget the subtly lecherous floorwalker, Captain Peacock, a pompous ex-army officer (or so he claims).  One gets a sense that this is probably the only position of authority he's ever had, and he milks it for all its worth, barking orders at his underlings at every opportunity.  His favourite target is the rough, bawdy maintenance man, Mr. Mash (replaced by Mr. Harman in the fourth series), a militant trade unionist who loves to goad Cpt. Peacock (and who probably makes more money than Peacock does too!).  Of the four actors who temporarily took over the role of department head following Brough's death, my favourite is Alfie Bass, who played shrewd Mr. Goldberg, himself an ex-army man, and from whom we glean a lot more about Corporal--I mean Captain--Peacock than Peacock would care to have known!

Then there is Mr. Rumbold, the bald-pated, jug-eared department manager (like Mollie Sugden, Nicholas Smith was very good-natured in allowing his physical appearance to be the basis of so much humour!).  Finally, there is Young Mr. Grace, the elderly and extremely frail but hilariously lustful store owner (Harold Bennett, who died of a heart attack in 1981 following series eight, was 74 when the series began!).

There are two discs of DVD extras, the first of which consists of three 30-minute profiles (John Inman (1999), Mollie Sugden (1998), and Wendy Richard (2001)), each of which provides a brief bio, snippets from the various television productions in which the actor has been involved, and remembrances from fellow actors.  The final feature is ""Are You Being Confused?"", a text-based dictionary of British slang.  The second disc contains two features which have appeared as PBS specials over the years:  Firstly, there is the 75-minute ""The Best of Are You Being Served?"", which is hosted by Mr. Humphreys and his mother (both played by John Inman, of course!), and which contains snippets of some of the funniest moments in the series.  Secondly is the lovely 90-minute profile of Mollie Sugden (2002), which also contains snippets from the shows she's been in and remembrances from fellow actors, yet it doesn't entirely duplicate the other profile.  Also included is the first episode of the 1992 sequel, ""Are You Being Served? Again!"".

With scripts liberally laced with double entendres, innuendos and puns, and a cast of characters made all the more memorable by some of the most capable actors in British comedy, this is character comedy at its best--a real Britcom classic!",1104278400,309,3888,5.198717948717949
