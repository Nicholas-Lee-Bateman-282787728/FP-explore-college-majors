8425352,5,B004DIPL6I,I saw him play these live and this is the next best thing. The sound is very well recorded and rewards listening with a good surround system,1471046400,,140,4.222222222222222
8425353,3,B004DIPL6I,"Sound and picture are absolutely stunning. The performance also ... all six French Suites, performed without break before a live audience, from memory.

That all said, there was something about the playing that was a little strange, that I couldn't quite put my finger on until I realized he was playing absolutely without pedal. This was confirmed to me when I saw him live in San Francisco a few weeks later (Oct. 2013). He played the entire Goldberg Variations, on piano, with zero pedals, his feet flat on the floor. (He did use pedal for Beethoven, the Diabelli Variations.)

Now, far be it from me to offer advice to a world-class virtuoso. But for myself, the pianoforte has an expression pedal for a reason, need I say it, to add a little shimmering and resonance when judiciously applied. It's a part of the received sound of our received instrument.

Sure, the pedal is a tool that can be abused, but then again, I suppose even the piano lid is a tool that can be abused. Anything on the piano can be abused. To not use the expression pedal because it may be abused, or because Bach didn't have one ... heck, then why bother with the modern piano at all, which Bach didn't have?

The bottom line is, does the performance WORK with zero pedal? In my opinion, no. It sounds half-baked.",1384560000,3,1293,4.560344827586207
8425354,5,B004DIPL6I,Nothing else to comment. Great performance of great pieces of a great composer on a great place with a great quality. :),1359590400,,120,4.5
8425355,1,B004DIPL6I,"The image is great, Schiff plays excellent. However, the DTS system of the blu ray was not remastered well and it has alot of cracking noises on high end stereo systems.
Not recommended.",1350691200,,186,4.666666666666667
8425356,5,B004DIPL6I,"He is without a doubt one of the top interpreters of Bach's piano music playing today. His play is smooth and elegant
Watch the audience at times, they seem to be transfixed while listening.
Highly recommended",1344902400,,209,4.833333333333333
8425357,5,B004DIPL6I,"Andras Schiff is not a naturally demonstrative player. Rather, he is a thoughtful musician who can be relied upon to deliver deeply considered views of the music he is playing - as if playing to himself. This does not necessarily make for riveting viewing but it certainly makes for a satisfyingly musical experience as demonstrated here.

For this reason I was not bothered by the choice of piano rather than an earlier keyboard instrument such as Bach might have envisioned. Nothing is attempted that is out of style in that respect and this belongs to that select group of recordings where doubts concerning the use of a piano are rendered irrelevant in the face of the relevancy of the interpretation that we are offered.

The concert is very long and comes with a substantial encore bonus, the popular and well-known Italian Concerto. It is unlikely that a 'better' performance or recording will be issued soon so this is something of a 'must buy' if the music attracts you. However, I am glad to be watching it in the comfort of my own home - those church pews look awfully hard and uncomfortable!

Good surround sound in DTS 5.1 as well as stereo and sympathetic camera work complete a very desirable package. I would expect this to give considerable satisfaction to future purchasers with the exception of those diametrically opposed to the use of a piano. There is thus every reason to suggest that this disc is worth the full 5 star rating.",1343520000,3,1450,4.746031746031746
8425358,5,B004DIPL6I,It is a privilege to listen to this unique musician and pianist. Schiff has a very deep understanding and knowledge of Bach compositions. His playing shows an extraordinary approach joining both intellect and feeling. He knows how to get any sound he wants from the piano. The utmost zenith of Bach interpretation.,1308441600,5,314,5.0576923076923075
8425359,5,B004DIPL6I,"This Blu-Ray of the French Suites is a nice companion to the DVD of the English Suites. But unlike his English Suites he plays the 6 French Suites one by one without a break. A remarkable effort. This performance is pure genius and beyond my power to criticize any part of it. If you are a Bach devotee you will not be disappointed with it. It's one of my favorites and I have listened to it(and watched it) many times.

One technical glitch. You can select a band to listen to but when it's finished the disc won't let you return to the main menu. So if I wanted to listen to suite 3 then suite 6 you would have to eject it, reload, then select suite 6. Maybe this is a fault with my LG player. I don't know, but I thought I'd mention it.",1302912000,7,739,4.061643835616438
8425360,5,B004DIPL6I,"Andrs Schiff has been lauded for decades for his playing of Bach. His performances tend to draw lavish praise (and occasional disapproval: I remember not liking his 'Goldberg Variations' set the first time I heard it and then grew to love it immoderately over time). This DVD of his performance of the six French Suites is a logical follow-up to his earlier DVD of the English Suites&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bach-English-Suites/dp/B000EQ5VGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bach: English Suites</a>. He plays the suites in numerical order in what looks to be a smallish space in a Protestant church in Leipzig during the Bachfest in the summer of 2010. He had, of course, earlier recorded (audio only) the French Suites to general acclaim&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bach-The-Six-French-Suites/dp/B0000041ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bach: The Six French Suites</a>&nbsp;and these present performances do not vary markedly from those. As you likely know, his playing of Bach is marked by smoothness (no Gouldian staccato here) and utter clarity of the polyphonic strands. There is no Romantic stretching or dramatic shaping of phrases, no major variation of dynamic, but tone is varied beautifully and completely at the service of the music. Audio for this DVD is nigh perfect. He is playing a Hamburg Steinway that was customized by Angelo Fabbrini. Schiff and Maurizio Pollini have recenetly been dedicated to Fabbrini's pianos and one can hear why; the sound of this piano is simply gorgeous and clearly it responds sensitively to Schiff's touch. The concert ends with Schiff playing Bach's Overture in the French Style in B Minor, BWV 831 and finally the Italian Concerto in F Major, BWV 971.

There is a second DVD lasting just over 30 minutes. It is entitled, rather inaccurately 'Andrs Schiff Explains Bach'. Better is should be called 'Andrs Schiff Talks About Bach.' It is filmed in the same church and features for most of its length a head-and-shoulders shot of Schiff sitting, relaxed on a bench, and  speaking in monolog. He speaks in German; there are subtitles available in English and French. He appears to be a gentle, soft-spoken man whose reverence for Bach is evident. He mentions starting every day, when there is a piano available, by playing Bach for about an hour. (I seem to remember that Rostropovich did the same thing -- at the piano, not the cello.) Schiff calls Bach the 'greatest composer of all time' -- just as Anthony Tommasini has just done in today's New York Times -- and expresses awe at the amount of music Bach wrote. 'It has been calculated that if one simply copied out his all his music by hand it would take several decades.' He also comments that no one in today's hurlyburly could find the silence that Bach required to do his work. (He points out that Bach always worked in a room away from his home with all its noisy children.) He speaks at length about the music in the French Suites, pointing out something I'd never quite realized -- that the first three are in minor keys, the last three in major keys. And he points out that Bach would never have expected anyone to play all of them in order in a concert. 'It takes a madman like me to do that.' The last five minutes or so show Schiff sitting at the piano,  talking about the structure of the French Overture in B Minor, demonstrating at the keyboard. Fascinating and illuminating.

One could wonder, I suppose, why one would want to watch a DVD of someone playing the piano, but the videography is such that certainly for students of the piano Schiff's playing could be instructive. He is one of those pianists whose entire energy flows through his arms and hands, while he sits quietly with none of the bodily dramatics that some pianists indulge in. Seeing the undemonstrative majesty in his playing adds to the aural experience.

Recommended.
