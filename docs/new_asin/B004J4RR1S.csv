8431591,1,B004J4RR1S,"Imagine wanting to make an ""Indian Jones"" type of film in England and being limited to a 20 Euro dollar budget. David Hilton (Richard Cambridge) is asked to look for the missing Professor Kixley who appears to have found the satanic ""Eye of Kali"" or at least the satanists who have kidnapped him. Armed with Kixley's assistant and a shovel, David goes to search for the idol which goes with the eye.

The fight scenes were more of a struggle for me to watch than they were to make. Special effects consist mostly of a green filter placed on the camera lens...couldn't afford a voice enhancer. The sound quality was poor. The sound track was playing plenty pf action music that was far more exciting than what was on screen.

The DVD quality was what I would expect from a bootleg. Near the end of the film, the movie goes dark while there is still sound. Then there is total blackness without sound, followed by film with no sound and finally they get it back on track.

The dialogue, acting, and characters aren't worth watching.",1413504000,,1030,4.556756756756757

8431593,4,B004J4RR1S,"A great ""quick--save the earth from Satanic apocalypse!"" story.  It's actually pretty disturbing though...they manage to get under your skin and freak you out!",1370390400,,159,5.625
8431594,4,B004J4RR1S,"This devil movie is spooky.  There isn't much in the blood & gore department here, but plenty of psychological creepiness that will keep you up at night if you're a wimp like me.  I really liked it, it's got a great story...it just scared the bejeezus out of me!",1368316800,,262,4.326530612244898
8431595,4,B004J4RR1S,"I wasn't sure about this movie before i watched it. I've had a few bad experiences with low budget british movies before. This was ok. The beginning was a little slow to begin with but well paced with plenty of action in the middle. The ending is very similar to raiders of the lost ark.
 I feared the worst when i saw that the movie starred richard cambridge and marysia kay from the atrocious demonic but cambridge is good in this and kay isn't in it much. Elliott is a sexy and feisty heroine .
 Not awesome but worth a watch.",1311897600,,529,4.227722772277228
8431596,4,B004J4RR1S,"I was expecting just your typical horror film, but was surprised when the story line turned out to be really good.  I didn't find it totally horrific but more entertaining with it's plot. Anyone who wants to watch a good movie will enjoy this.",1307145600,2,243,4.5227272727272725
8431597,5,B004J4RR1S,"I thought for an indie Horror/adventure, that this was very well done, I was thoroughly entertained the whole time. I would defenitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good movie to watch, not just horror fans.",1303171200,2,222,4.868421052631579
8431598,3,B004J4RR1S,"OK,Hold on this is an English/Irish co-production based on Indiana Jones.
Some scenes are definitely similar to original `Raiders Of The Lost Ark',But,'Tween influences like cool cars and spiffy bad guys.
This is a possible dvd series from Chemical Burn, Hope they build on more challenging action traditions.
Plot moves well,lots of action fighting,Car stunts and explosions.",1299715200,2,376,5.614035087719298
