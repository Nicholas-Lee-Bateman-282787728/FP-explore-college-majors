6564475,5,B00M8BC570,"This was a very good movie.  My husband chose it and I wasn't initially aware that it was a Christian movie.  It becomes apparent after a short time.  Many times Christian movies are kind of predictable, this one was not-- in my opinion.  As someone else said, it might not be appropriate for younger children, I'd say under 9 or 10.  It's worth watching.",1519948800,,355,4.484375

6564481,5,B00M8BC570,"This is a divine movie.  I truly enjoyed it.

6564485,4,B00M8BC570,"I see there is a lot of criticism about the story and filmmaking. There is warning that it is a Christian movie as it says a quote about God in the cover of the dvd. Others criticize the acting and shooting.

It is an excellent story about loss. As most Christian movies there is a tight budget. A lot of the actors are volunteers. If you are against low budget movies or Christian ones why not order something else??

This movie has 5 doves ranked for family fun. There are some hi jinks but for the most part this movie deals about how one learns to deal with loss from a Christian viewpoint.

I always research something before buying I got to view this for free on Amazon Prime and my wife and I enjoyed it enough to order it.

There is loss in everyones life and certainly in mine. It is how I dealt w my loss that is important. So if Christian movies or low budget movies bother you I suggest you purchase something else. If you are like me and enjoy a great story and to see people change over a little bit of stilted acting and corniness then this might just be for you.

It really is what you do with the crisises in life that really counts. IMHO.",1516492800,9,1156,4.165919282511211
6564486,2,B00M8BC570,"Yes, all things do happen for a reason, but not all reasons are God's reason.  We live in a broken world, an imperfect world. Jesus told us in scripture that we would have troubles, tribulations, and trials and distress and frustration in this world. See John 16:33.  He will see us through those troubles. He said that good things can come out of bad situations for those that love Him. He doesn't make the bad things happen to us. He restores us in the midst of heartbreak. THAT is the plan.",1515801600,,493,4.406593406593407

6564505,1,B00M8BC570,"I really don't like rating things with a bad rating, and usually don't even bother, but I had to with this one. Hopefully it saves someone else the time of searching through looking for something to watch, and then waste their time on this one. It seemed to have a really good story line, but I'm not even sure of that because I only made it about 15 minutes in before I gave up. I only gave up for one reason.....THE ACTING IS HORRIFIC.
The young man who's the main character, I mean...ok, A for effort but COME ON. The acting was so ""forced"" that it was annoying, facial expressions were so overdone I cringed every time he was suppose to be annoyed with his parents. The rest of the acting was just as bad if not worse. Shame.
I do notice that most of the higher star reviews on here were simple because it was evidently a ""faith based"" film. I didn't know that when I started watching it, nor would I care either way. But you shouldn't rate something 5 stars just because it's considered a ""Christian movie""......bottom line is, the acting is bad. REALLY BAD. What else makes a GOOD movie?",1502409600,,1093,4.362745098039215

It's too bad they missed the mark with their Christian message because of the low quality of acting. The music was not too bad, but it did not blend well with the movie. I thought if one question, when the parents were discussing ""going to church"" there at the camp, they invited their young son to go. That seemed strange since most devout Christians would take their children to church, not ask them if they want to go. They are parents, they can do that.",1502236800,,630,4.535087719298246

Most younger kids are just learning about how the world works and it's not always easy for parent to explain logic.  So the best thing to do is don't bother and allow your kids to be indoctrinated.  Once indoctrinated, they will grow up to be loyal sheep.  The church will have a steady income and you can pretty much make them do as you please since they haven't develop an sense of logic or reasoning skills.  This movie teaches you to let go and allow someone else to think for you.  All you have to do is give in to god and everything will be alright.  For everyone else who has free-will and don't want to give indoctrination a chance, you won't like this.  it will just be a waste of time that you will never get back.

Then I realized that Christianity is NO different than any other religion that exists on Earth. It's all a bunch of B.S. that serves to ""conglomerate your group"". I know this comment will be erased by the committee censoring the comments. I just hope that the ideas stick with some of the censors. You are committing atrocities. You know that you have been lied to, that you are lying to yourself, and even worse, that you are lying to future generations. Christianity, Islam, Judaism are all filled with lies. Hinduism? Lies.

The Current is an excellent movie that really hit home with me. Yes, it is a faith-based movie and that might scare some people away, but it helps those who have dealt with loss and suffering. Our 21 year old son passed away four years ago and the hurt still resurfaces to full intensity sometimes, especially around holidays, anniversaries and birthdays.

6564540,1,B00M8BC570,"Christian Propaganda film.
Message: No matter what happens, belief in god solves everything.  Even the bad parts of life are part of gods plan.
If you have heard this before and don't buy into christian fantasy and dogma, skip it.
Christian propaganda films should come with a warning tag so that those of us who realize Yahweh was myth / lie / made up story....can skip the film. There was no Yahweh / Jehovah who created humanity 6000 years ago, humanity is much older than that. There was no Yahweh that then flooded the world with Noah global flood 4300 years ago. The Native Americans for example failed to notice humanity had not started yet and....lived on despite NOT going to the middle east to get on Noahs boat.
Films that depict the bible as true promote lies. Its time...these lies and liars just ....stopped.
Jesus allegedly believed that he was the direct descendant of mythical Adam and mythical Noah. No human in direct contact with a truthful god would have mad that type of mistake. (See Luke 3 re genealogy of Jesus). The Jesus character was a work of fiction.
Christian groups at times play games with the length of a creative day in the genesis story to try to escape the problem with the bibles teaching of 6000 year old humanity. The problem is that there are also passages translated with the word begat. A was X years old and begat B. B was Y years old and begat C. It is a simple addition problem to figure out x+y years passed from the beginning of A to the birth of C. This process can be used repeatedly to build a timeline from Adam forward and including the alleged flood of Noah. No matter how churches try to play games with creative days, ignoring the begats only works with people ignorant of the bible and its contents. It is important to figure out a time line using the bible, then compare this to what was happening with Native Americans, Australian Aborigines, Africans, Sumerians, Egyptians, Africans etc during the biblical beginning of humanity 6000 years ago and during the alleged global flood 4300 years ago. People in these locations before humans allegedly existed and that lived on despite an alleged flood that killed all life not on the ark is a HUGE problem. The bible lied. Killing all life not on the Ark means that all plants and animals around the world that only can grow in one location on earth...would have been killed. The bible states the flood was global and killed ALL life not on the ark. Your country for example would have been rendered dead mud.
The bible then alleges that god confused the languages. IF you have done your timeline and figure out when this happened per the bible, you will find that the Egyptians and Sumerians not only were speaking their own languages by the time of the alleged Tower of Babel but each group had written records in their own languages over 1000 years before the bible states more than one language came to be used. The bible lied again. These are not the only lies in the bible. IT only takes ONE lie to prove a religion false. No good god would ever reward people for believing lies.
See Wikipedia re James Usher.. He did the math to figure out the biblical time line.
See the Catholic Encyclopedia re Adam. They admit its ...not true. though call it religious poetry, spiritually true though not literally true. The problem is that Jesus allegedly disagreed and allegedly taught a literal Adam and Eve, literal flood and literal Yahweh. Note that the evidence is that Jesus was a fiction created from stories of other god / hero myths from other cultures.

A semi intelligent 8 year old with an internet connection can look up Canaanite gods to see how the Yahweh myth developed
They may look up the going theory as to why sea shells are found on mountain tops. Stone age man thought that meant the world had to be flooded in the recent past. We now know mountains can be pushed upwards from ancient sea floors via plate tectonics. BIble writers guessed at why there are sea shells on mountain tops...and they guessed wrong. If a truthful god was guiding the writing of the bible....they would not have guessed wrong.

My favorite bible stupidity is in Genesis 30. It states that animals inherit their coat pattern not from DNA. A truthful god could have supplied this answer. Instead animals allegedly inherit their coat patterns based on what they SEE while mating. Bible character Jacob agreed with Laban that Jacob would keep spotted animals and Laban would keep those with a solid coat. Jacob then put a notched (therefore spotted) stick in front of animals that were mating and their offspring were born spotted. According to this understanding of inheritance, placing a paisley or plaid cloth in the fields should lead to paisley cows or plaid sheep. It also means that babies should look really interesting given the many designs of bedspreads these days.

I rated this movie 1 star. Honest and honorable people would not spread lies and misinformation. At a minimum this video needs a warning label that spreading standard christian lies is the point of the film.",1499731200,6,5080,4.666294642857143

The setting is relevant and makes us feel like we were there too. My tween was bawling w/ this film. Rich in good values represented by real things that happen in our lives. Good eye opener and good way to share God's word.
