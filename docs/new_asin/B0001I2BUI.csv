2003721,5,B0001I2BUI,"My expectations were high when I learned that HBO was going to spend over $60 million on an adaptation of Tony Kushner's extraordinary 6-hour epic play, but I could nt have imagined that the resulting film would move to the top of my list of best films ever made in the United States - but that is precisely what Angels in America has done.
Streep and Pacino deliver the finest performances of their careers here (Streep in 4 roles!). Emma Thompson is radiant. And the performances of Jeffrey Wright, Mary-Louise Parker, Justin Kirk and Ben Shenkman positively shine.
And the WRITING and DIRECTION! As close to Shakespearean as any American work I have ever read. And scenes that captivate in their composition and lighting, in their structure and their content. And a magical blending of profundity, humor, pathos, tragedy, and ultimately, the triumph of the human spirit over desperation and resignation. A musical score to match the high levels of word and vision.
In short, this film is nothing short of miraculous. All who worked on this masterpiece should be proud of their achievement. Angels in America stands as testimony to what the human mind can accomplish at its finest and most creative.",1077494400,306,1201,4.921182266009852
2003722,5,B0001I2BUI,"I first saw this play about three years ago, and fell in love with it.  I went back three times to see it before it closed at the end of the week.  So, as you can imagine, I was both intrigued and afraid of what HBO might to do this wonderful play.
As I began watching, I was impressed with the cinematography, although a few of the characters seemed a bit stiff, and hard to relate to as actual human beings.  Perhaps this was do to the toned-down style of acting in film as opposed to theatre.  By the end, however, I was almost in tears.  This is the best film I've seen in a very long time.",1077494400,11,594,4.0
2003723,5,B0001I2BUI,"This is simply the most amazing cinematic achievment in decades and one of the finest films ever. The Motion Picture Academy should award a special Oscar, even though it was made for TV.",1077494400,17,186,4.666666666666667
2003724,5,B0001I2BUI,"It is a rare thing indeed when a play in this day and age with this kind of subject matter that did very well on the stage can be captured so ethereally by the camera. This film not only tugs at your heart but it opens it as well by inviting you into this world and holding your hand through it, leading you to the other side. Questions are asked and like in everyday life there are no clear cut answers. But the questions are provocative and the answers we do get are enlightening, and they lead to other questions.  Sometimes in life the destination isn't the goal, but the journey to get there.  All we really know how to do is survive because that's all we can do and sometimes that's enough.
This film is also poinant because right now in 2004 there are people out there who think AIDS and the devastating effects it has on people is over because a few drug companies have come up with something that works for some (not all).  Angels in America brings it back down to the human level of suffering, while at the same time asking us exalted questions not only about faith and destiny put the level of that faith, and our understanding of our destiny.
Who we are isn't dictated to us by the level of our adversity, but by how we address it.  With what dignity we come to the table and confront our fears, our anger and our pain.  One can only be defeated if one refuses to get back up again.",1077408000,38,1394,4.225563909774436

2003799,3,B0001I2BUI,"OK, the first time I saw this I was blown away by the performances and they really are practically all Oscar-worthy.  But the story was not anything I could relate to.  What on Earth?  The only character I felt drawn to, that I peripherally connected with ended up being discarded in the end: the closeted Mormon guy.  His wife was relatable even though she was a drug addict.  As for the main gay characters, I really could not relate to any of them.  The couple struggling with AIDS was not likeable.  While the performances were stunning (Meryl Streep taunting Al Pacino as Ethel Rosenberg before he died was chilling), I really have no need to see it again.",1483142400,,661,4.5508474576271185

2003803,4,B0001I2BUI,"This movie, running very long and feeling a lot like an episodic TV movie, is about the early AIDS crisis, and the men's lives who were ravaged by the disease.  As seen in the poster art and video packaging, one of the men afflicted with aids and afraid he will die is visited periodically by an angel, played by Emma Thompson.

Three excellent performances are given by Al Pacino, Jeffrey Wright, and Meryl Streep.  Wright and Streep play multiple roles.  Jeffrey Wright's performance was so compelling that many times I forgot I was watching a movie.",1473638400,,552,4.71875

2003827,5,B0001I2BUI,"Incredible!  One of the best mini-series I've ever seen.  You'll laugh out loud at certain points, and feel like crying during others.  Mary-Louise Parker is absolute perfection!  And the entire cast is amazing.  (I watched with the captions turned on, because the dialogue by Tony Kushner is so great.)  I know that I'll revisit this mini-series many more times in the future.

NOTE: Most of the negative reviews are from people expecting some sort of ""quaint"" story involving a traditional concept of ""angels"".  (After all Meryl Streep is involved in the project...).  Or from people who take exception to the liberal perspective which is expressed throughout, specifically as it relates to the 1980s Reagan era.  And yes the mini-series is sympathetic to the gay community during the AIDs epidemic.",1462579200,6,801,5.1395348837209305

HOWEVER,  it was pretty long and drawn-out and it was presented within the story of a gay couple.  I have gay friends and am not prejudiced at all, but I am not interested in watching a movie about gays.  The message is tolerance and I am all for that, but the people who really need to get this message are not going to watch something in this context.",1453593600,,490,4.170212765957447

2003850,4,B0001I2BUI,"I like to write when matters are fresh in my mind: This is a 6 hour film don't let that scare you as strangely after watching the Russian version of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy that seemed like it was 6 hours, but strangely this did not seem to be 6 hours. But what can I say about this film where I have to think as to the point of it all. Good acting okay for sure but I am still at lost after watching once so as to pin point a meaning of this film with creative appearance by the late dead Ethyl Rosenberg (played by Meryl Streep) and ""angels"" though I don't believe in the supernatural nor in the use of the supernatural as an artistic vehicle to present ideas though I am not entirely opposed to such ideas there are limitations. Was this about people or the AIDS epidemic and those closet queens in the establishment like Roy Cohen played by Al Pacino. ????I think I will have to watch this again though I am giving 4 stars.",1445126400,,932,4.126373626373627

I watched the real drama play out while living in Oklahoma, seeing young men deserted by families, communities, and churches, left to die alone and hopeless. A coalition was formed, called RAIN, Regional AIDS Interfaith Network, that brought together folks from all denominations, ages, races and income levels, who felt that everyone deserves to be loved and cared for.  Being involved in RAIN changed the final weeks and months for many AIDS patients, but also help reconcile families, and the volunteer caregivers such as myself.

2003921,5,B0001I2BUI,"First off, I have to say that Justin Kirk did an amazing job here, a performance that is often mentioned secondary to those of the more established actors in the film (Pacino, Thompson, and Streep).  I loved Kirk as Andy on Weeds, and he is just as fantastic here - perhaps more so.  Ben Shenkman was equally incredible, as was Jeffrey Wright.  Belize and Prior were, without question, my favorite characters in the film.

While I can understand the dislike many felt toward Louis (Shenkman's character), I could also accept where he was coming from and why he did the things he did.  No character here was an evil person - well, maybe with the exception of Roy Cohn.

I approached this miniseries with hesitation due to its length - it's a lot to ask to devote six hours of your time of the same topic, especially when you're not sure whether or not it is quality material - but I was instantly riveted.  I completed the first three hours yesterday and could not wait to finish the last three hours today.  Angels in America unabashedly explores the very fabric of what makes us human, and while at times it does get a bit weird with Prior and Harper's fever dreams/hallucinations, the film is simply spell-binding.  You can appreciate why actors like Streep and Pacino are so revered, as there are often scenes in which they convey so much with nothing more than the shift of a glance.

I am not familiar with the play on which this miniseries was based, but from the light research I have done, the miniseries does appear to be a fantastic, true-to-form adaptation (and having Kushner write the screenplay was probably a huge help in that regard).  I wanted to see this film years ago, and I'm sorry it took me this long to get around to it, but this is certainly a case of ""better late than never.""  If this film were a person, I'd hug it.",1401321600,5,1843,4.485029940119761

2003936,5,B0001I2BUI,"I read about Tony Kushner's play and was fascinated so when it came out as a movie I had to have it. Meryl Streep steals the show in her completely different roles as others in the cast do. It covers so much of the AIDS/HIV history as it relates to a group of people, gay and straight, male and female without holding back on how it affects their lives.

2003938,5,B0001I2BUI,"Angels in America is a drama, set in the Regan era, about post-war America from the 50s through the 80s. Produced as a mini-series by HBO, based on the play in two Parts by Tony Kuschner, Angels in America is a gay-themed work by a gay author, cleverly weaving politically and socially relevant characters and issues into a broader tapestry portraying the lives of men and women in 1980s New York at the height of the emerging AIDS epidemic. The rabid anti-communism of this period is drawn into the orbit of the drama in the persons of Roy Cohn -- Joseph McCarthy's unctuous and arrogant attorney (alongside Richard Nixon) during the anti-communist witch-hunts of the HUOC -- as well as Ethel Rosenberg, executed as a Soviet spy in 1953, and a young attorney facing important career decisions within the Republican Party. The characters in the drama are caught up in the sweep of contemporary trends and converse much about politics, culture and the human condition with passion and humor: AIDS, politics, race, political and sexual orientation, loyalty, cowardice, religion, the conflict between the political Left and Right, American history.
Angels in America may well be most interesting and its subtle humor most accessible to viewers on the Left side of the political spectrum, though thoughtful conservatives can also find much entertainment and food for thought in this epic drama.
Angels in America, based on its clever construction, narrative brilliance, sensitive probing of eternal themes, and masterful literary technique, is -- in my opinion -- a masterpiece of American theater. It is far from light entertainment and certainly nothing for the weak-hearted or weak-headed. Anyone interested in serious theater/film reflecting high literary ambitions and the intent to engage pressing political and cultural issues should find the investment of some seven hours well repaid.",1390694400,3,1889,5.258278145695364

2003976,4,B0001I2BUI,"When I was a theatre student, my fellow classmates frequently chose scenes from this play to perform for class. So when the movie came out (not until after I graduated) I was eager to see the whole thing. I didn't really know what to expect. A few 5-minute scenes don't explain much of a 6-hour story. And the back of the box says nothing.

So... I was surprised. The gay men and AIDS theme was the only thing remotely grounded in reality. The angel, dreams, hallucinations, prophecies, a trip to heaven... you never really knew what was going on, and it was fascinating to watch, and analyze. Many of the actors played multiple roles. Most of the characters were likable, although some were deplorable. I felt the sex, nudity and obscenities were overdone. That really brings down the intelligence level of a good movie, in my opinion. (They did not have enough confidence that the story was compelling and interesting enough to keep our attention on its own merits? Especially with the actors they managed to cast?? Guess not.)

2003978,4,B0001I2BUI,"I don't normally review movies that are actually TV mini-series, but this one is really unique. It's also six hours long, on two DVDs.

It's full of stars: Al Pacino plays Roy Cohn, a Jewish lawyer and Washington insider who is ""evil incarnate,"" as one character puts it. Meryl Streep plays Hannah Pitt, mother of Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson) and mother-in-law of Harper Pitt (Mary-Louise Parker), two very confused Mormons. Streep also has two other roles; look for her.

In fact, quite a few people play more than one roll in this odd film. Emma Thompson is Nurse Emily, but also the guardian angel of America. She appears first in white, and later in dark blue with white. I think she also played a homeless person who told Hannah Pitt how to find her way to her son's apartment.

My favorite character is Jeffrey Wright, a flaming queen who is Nurse Belize, and also a mystical travel agent, and I think also a rather phony leather queen in the park.

Yes, it's that kind of movie.

The basic story is that Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) lives with his lover, Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), but they break up when Prior is diagnosed with AIDS and Lou can't handle the whole thing. Meanwhile the evil Roy Cohn is trying to persuade the straight-laced (or is that laced up straight?) Joe Pitt to take a job with the Justice Department that he has arranged for him. Roy needs someone on the inside because he's about to be disbarred for borrowing a bunch of money from a client and ""neglecting"" to pay it back. Why Joe? Because Cohn is a closet queen who has lust in his heart for the handsome young Mormon.

Unfortunately, Joe is tightly laced indeed. He and his wife are ""buddies,"" but their sex life is pretty awful for both of them. Also, she's a Valium addict and has hallucinations and weird episodes of a variety of types.

It's hard to know when something is a dream, a hallucination, or a real part of the story. I finally decided it was easier to just treat them all as events to be evaluated later. That seems to have worked best.

This is sort of a cross between ""Dogma"" and ""The Birdcage,"" although there is a lot of serious stuff, and a lot of sadness. There are also some superb laughs, as when the Angel has to ""revise the record"" because the Prophet to whom she appears, Prior Walter, is not behaving as predicted. But the sex scene between the Angel and Prior (whom, you will recall, is decidedly gay) is excellent, and reminds me of ""Angel Fire"" by Andrew Greeley.

Just toss out all your assumptions and expectations, and enjoy the movie. The preachy part is all the way at the end, in an epilogue. And it, too, is not something you could predict.",1336694400,,2660,4.490683229813665

Each member of the cast is poignant and adds news layers to their characters, particularly Mary Louise Parker, whose portrayal of Harper Pitt is stunning and one that I will always remember.",1307318400,,651,4.344262295081967
2003985,4,B0001I2BUI,"This was a great movie, only it seems to have been written as one long poem, of which I could not understand a word of what Emma Thompson's angelic character was saying--Gibberish, Gibberish, Goo, Gibberish. The acting was of the finest qualtity. Meryl Streep(Hannah Pitt & E. Rosenberg) is a constant. One would have better odds criticizing her performances that are not excellent. I don't know any Jews , but I have often heard of the stereotype about Jews and guilt. Ben Shenkman did the stereotype more than justice as the guilt ridden gay Jew, Louis, who leaves his  lover, Prior, when he finds out that he has A.I.D.S. His very anal over examining and judging everthing else, while well acted, was irritating. While not knowing which way to turn, he seemed to know what was at the end of every road. Al Pacino gave one of his best performances as Roy Cohn, the conservative, closeted gay king maker. Eyes never wondered while watching his performance. While many may have hated his character, none could hate his performance or fail to feel feel empathy at his suffering and death. Belize, the gay nurse was yet another gay angry at the world. He seemed to know everything about anything and was angry with what he knew. Jeffrey Wright(Belize) did well putting everyone in their place- guilting some, uplifting others, empathizing with more. His reluctant forgiveness of the just dead, Roy Cohn, and teaching Louis to forgive him was unexpected  and welcome , considering all of Belize's apparent pent up anger at his perception of a world hostile  and unaccepting of gays and all people who are different. Justin Kirk's Prior, played ever emotion to perfection.  One could not help but sympathize when he suffered and related to his frustration. Cheated out of life and refusing to accept death he took the viewers everywhere from angry with God and the angels, not willing to accept heaven to accepting of the struggle to live for life's sake, his performance was nothing short of deserving to be on the same stage with Pacino and Streep.

One of my main problems was the writing, though great as a script idea, was too poetic. Everyone seemed to be teaching a class with one subject, from a a book of poetry written by one angry writer. This movie was good at portraying different views but, for the most part,  the views were different because the people were. One could feel that string of agreement running through the theme of the movie. We just had to wait to get there.  The big costar in the room was the antagonist of all things traditional, represented by the anger at patriotism, Ronald Reagan, tradition, Biblical morality, etc, etc. There was no positive view expressed for either. Patrick Wilson's character 's views represented the closest thing to ""the other side"". Now Streep's character was a good Mormon, but was educated to the error of her ways ,as portrayed in the film. She did not surrender her faith totally.

Streep was excellent as Ethel Rosenberg and Joe Pitt's mother, Hannah. Her Hollywood nickname should be ""The Standard"". Pacino did not have to pretend to be excellent as Roy Cohn. Mary Louise Parker, who played  the pill-popping suffering, neglected, wife of Joe Pitt, did good as a spacy, wife, fed up with a husband at home with her, who did not want to be. Again, her lines , like most was total poetry. When not lashing her husband with  her tongue, she escaped her marriage , by escaping reality. The place she went to ,though, served no purpose at all for the movie. As angry as Belize was at America, Capitalism and moral non-relativism, , he was only rivaled by Louis' guilt and certain examining every aspect of life.  Louis(Shenkman)as a guilt ridden Jewish gay man , who new all except himself lit up the screen with his perfomance. Not knowing which way to turn after his crime against Prior, and by extension, everyone ill with A.I.D.S, he used nieve, freshly out of the closet, Joe, to asuage his guilt , until Joe falls in love with Louis and Ben discovers that Joe's paycheck is not signed by a member of the union.

Great Movie. Too much poetry. Too one sided, as you know where the writers are going. No, and I do mean no, fair representation of opposing views. Not one full character represented the non-Hollywood, non liberal, non anti-Bibilcial view of homosexuality, suffering and compassion(except for Joe, but he was confused and bewildered throughout much of the movie). Anger was everone's motive. The portrayal of suffering from A.I.D.S emotionally and physically was revealing and educational. The goal of teaching those of us not touched by this disease-met. The goal of a great movie sometimes,  is to take us where we don't want to go. This should include the screenwriters.

PS. I absolutely loved the gospel song sang in the church, at the funeral,  by the transvestite. If anyone knows, please leave a comment and let me know it that song is on the soundtrack before I purchase it.",1305504000,2,4958,4.768961493582264

2003987,3,B0001I2BUI,"Don't get me wrong, I liked quite a bit of the movie. It had potential to be a powerful film (I especially enjoyed the big appearance of Emma Thompson in ""Stop Moving!"").  But after 6 hours of watching, the main two couples couldn't reconcile their differences, and split. There were also three characters with loose ends, which don't get me wrong, a movie needn't be stupidly happy, but five years passed, and we learned nothing of one of the original couples, or of what happened in Heaven.  Did God return? Or was it like waiting for Godot, and he never showed up? They didn't even give us the courtesy of that one.

And all of this might have been okay but for the last problem. As my acting teacher said, ""show us, don't tell us.""  They had not one, but about five characters fourth-wall monologue. It was trite and preachy, and after six hours, what you wanted to know about wasn't told, and instead you got some story of the angel Bethesda.

Ultimately, after a six hour film, you want something grand or meaningful (like the Mahabharata where they are tested in heaven against their enemies). This was neither, the scene in heaven kinda fizzled, about when he went on about suing God.  Yeah, I know there was this whole metaphor for the male figure leaving, but still... I guess this is what kinda made it so weak was it was okay to forgive someone you hated (the crotchey old man that hoarded drugs for his own benefit), but not someone you love? What?!? Shouldn't there be all the more reason to forgive since you do love? Nope, let's get on a plane and wax philosophical about souls rebuilding the ozone.",1303344000,4,1615,4.5326460481099655
2003988,5,B0001I2BUI,"This is a perfect production of a perfect play. The performances from the entire cast are to die for - Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson, Mary Louise Parker, Jeffery Wright, and Emma Thompson - all are perfect. You could not find a better cast to play these roles. At least four of the actors play multiple roles in this epic film, which deals with the search for meaning during the AIDS epidemic in the eighties.

Angels in America, as adapted by Tony Kushner from his own play, is a moving, fantastical, campy, and unsettling experience. The entire film spans six hours, and this allows you to become immersed in the story, as well as emotionally invested in the many complex characters. There will probably never be another miniseries like it. It is one of a kind. Mike Nichols' direction is as superb here as it was in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Closer. This film is proof that he has not lost his touch!

I become a little breathless when I think of some of the scenes - one that comes to mind often is the scene between Belize and Roy, when Belize describes his vision of heaven. Time stops for me when I view this. It is so beautiful and terrible; the idea that Belize's vision seems like hell to Roy - and that Belize knows this and describes it deliberately with that in mind. Who knows if this really is his vision of heaven - only he knows. Very interesting to think about.",1259625600,2,636,4.264462809917355
2003998,5,B0001I2BUI,"Amazing as it might seem, I had seen neither the play (it premiered in Seattle) nor the movie, which I'd bought, then put aside unviewed (like so many other things). It was only Wednesday night when I popped it into the player and was knocked for a loop. (I can't think of a less-trite expression.)

It is, first and formost, a brutal, testicle-kicking attack on post-Reagan ""conservatism"". It's fortunate that Roy Cohn -- one of the most-vicious American politicians of the last century, and a homosexual who died of AIDS -- actually existed, so that Tony Kushner did not have to invent him. He is a convenient personification of everything the author (and I) detest in American society.

I am at a loss to say anything ""intelligent"" (or even original) about a movie in which every character is deeply flawed, a film that is sufficiently complex (and ambiguous, where appropriate) that it cannot reveal everything in a single viewing. ""Angels in America"" is worth seeing simply for the quality of writing, acting, and direction. (The special effects ain't bad, either.)

If I have any complaints, it's that theatrical metaphor -- which is acceptable within a stage work's lack of literal reality -- can seem a bit heavy-handed in a film, which appears to be literally real.

It's a mistake to view ""Angels in America"" solely as a chronicle of how AIDS devastated the gay community. Yes, it's also a polemic, but Kushner gets away with it by remembering that you cannot tell a story about ideas, you can only tell a story about people.

Like any Great Work Of Art (and it is one), it is, fundamentally, about how human beings cope with life. It's one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen, and I cannot recommend it too highly.",1256860800,6,1732,4.740863787375416
2003999,5,B0001I2BUI,"Politics and religion aside, the acting alone is reason enough to watch this film. Jefferey Wright and Justin Kirk's performances stand out amongst an entire cast of great performances. Not a sour note in the bunch.",1251158400,,215,5.0
2004000,3,B0001I2BUI,"Angels in America: 6/10: The play Angels in America must have had a much greater impact in the nineties then the miniseries has today. It also probably worked better as a play. That said; this is one of the more creative adaptations of theater one is likely to see on the small screen.

Mike Nichols deserves great praise for making the stage bound fly. He over reaches occasionally but the effect is memorizing. Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Justin Kirk all shine. While the brilliant Jeffery Wright simply steals every scene he is in. Mary Louise Parker and relative newcomer Patrick Wilson are unfortunately saddled with a disposable story that does not really fit in with the rest of the play. In fact, poor Mr. Wilson simply disappears for the last third or so of the miniseries while his characters mother played by Meryl Streep takes center stage.

Pacino's Roy Cohn is hammy and not played as evil as he was in the original play. While Cohn has been more forgotten than redeemed since the play first came out; his nemesis Ethel Rosenberg's (Streep again) reputation has suffered greatly since the mid-nineties. While Pacino is very good, Streep is simply brilliant in the very well written role of a Mormon mother lost in New York. Her character simply surprises both the other characters and the audience by not sticking to our preconceived notions.

Two actors however do drop the ball. Emma Thompson simply does not make a good angel. She is not helped by the fact that the angel moves around like Peter Pan in a junior high school production. As a result many of the angel scenes simply do not work.

The other problematic performance is Ben Shenkman as Louis. One quickly has sympathy for every character that suffers with an encounter with Shenkman. Unfortunately the audience suffers the most screen time with this horrible persona. The character is simply evil. That self centered, banal evil one finds in real life. This is of course fine in a film, but Shenkman the actor doesn't seem to realize how repellent his character's actions are. Instead of developing the evil he simply pulls out Jewish stereotypes. Compare this to Pacino's entertaining vision of evil in the persona of Mr. Cohn.

Creative and surprisingly fun Angels in America does run a little long (as a miniseries is won't to do) but is worth a look.",1248825600,2,2332,4.776674937965261

Good plays always represent a potential for good films since they already have a good script to start with - the least a play must have. But take a great play like this one by the genius of Tony Kushner, add the genius of a director in top form together with top actors like Al Pucino at his best with the other great performances by the amazing Mary Louise Parker, the strikingly superb Ben Shenkman and Patrick Wilson along with the divine Emma Thompson and you get an incredible knock out film that's more than a movie somehow.

Each hour installment will literally take your breath away. It's as sweeping as it is lugurious. Mike Nichols does an amazing job at transitioning Tony Kushner's beautiful and sprawling play on film. I only wished the producers had considered releasing the film in two halves in theaters; now that would truely be an event.

'Angels in America' is about many things to many people. For the most part it is a historical account of homosexual life during the Regan era (1980s). There is an assembly of one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever from big timers like Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Emma Thompson to the equally ""big"" Mary-Louise Parker, Justin Kirk, Patrick Wilson, and Jeffery Wright; all do a phenomenal job in their roles-many have multiple roles. Though the film tackles AIDS in America which can prove to damning in its depressing portait, the film is nevertheless joyously hopeful.

Everything about this film is astonishing and top notch. No expense was spared. The production is excellent from shooting New York City to shooting the heavens; it's absolutely stunning. The dialogue is rich and complex and is just as beautiful as anything Shakespeare has written-only far more modern.

It's no doubt 'Angels in America' holds a special place in my heart. It's one of the rare films that speaks to me, and even though it's considered a mini-series, it's definitely one of my favorite films of all time, a classic! You will wowed! ""Prepare!

The acting was fabulous, especially those actors (already mentioned many times by other reviewers) who took multiple roles. Justin Kirk and Jeffrey Wright were a wonder. I had only seen Wright in one other movie (Basquiat, that was him, wasn't it?) and I liked him then...

I still cannot figure out why Joe Pitt is shunned at the end, even as his mother becomes central to the in-group. Or, does Joe - the model of right-wing Republicanism who perhaps grows/changes least during the film - do the shunning?

2004014,3,B0001I2BUI,"It was with a lot of anticipation that watched ANGELS IN AMERICA - the adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize winning play about the HIV outbreak during the Reagan years.

Lots of people here have criticized this 6-hour HBO huge production for political reasons... or because they disagree with some of the views axpressed... or because it supposedly glorifies this or that... or because Ethel Rosemberg is portraited in a certain way... etc.

But ANGELS IN AMERICA disappointed me simply because of its weaknesses as a film.

FIRST - It is a 6-hour film that has no material to be 6 hours long. At best, it could have been 3 hours long. I have nothing about long films when ""long"" is a consequence of a real dramatic necessity. Here it looks like the producers decided to stretch the screenplay in order to make it look more epic or more overwhelming, or more important, or something it clearly is not. MAYBE it was just a way of justifying the big budget.

SECOND - The scenes are clearly overlong with lots and lots of excessive dialog. The dialog is sometimes beautiful, powerful and poetic... but lost in the excess of talking heads.

THIRD - The ending itself lasts over 30 minutes. It looks like the third&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LORD-OF-THE-RINGS/dp/B000634DCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LORD OF THE RINGS</a>: it takes forever to end!!

FOURTH - While Al Pacino (the lawyer who dies of AIDS), Jeffrey Wright (unforgettable as Belize, the gay black nurse) and Justin Kirk (as the AIDS victim who is abandoned by his boyfriend) all give beautiful performances, I must say that the other characters look like cardboard stereotypes.

And they are stereotypes because the author clearly hates them: A Mormon (Patrick Wilson) who discover he is gay, his wife (Mary-Louise Parker who looks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WILL-GRACE/dp/B00009Y3RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WILL & GRACE</a>'s Karen Walker on Valium), his Mormon mother (Meryl Streep) who does not understand her son, and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), the selfish liberal Reagan-hater.

With six hours of film, one would expect all these character would have a lot more substance... but only some of them really are that developed. Take the mother (Meryl Streep), for example: she is a Mormon who arrives in NYC after discovering her son is gay. She is clearly someone with lots of prejudices and hate. And yet... we hardly see her having to cope with reality. We hardly the character's arch. Suddenly, she helps Walter Prior (Justin Kirk) to get to the hospital, stays with him, sees the angel, gets frightened and leaves the next morning saying she had a strange dream... and suddenly she is the most gay-friendly person in the world. And not a hint on how her relationship with her own son (the Mormon gay guy) has changed.

FIFTH - Somebody please explain to me WHY, on the very first scene, do we see Meryl Streep as an 80-year old Rabi? The make-up is great... but her voice OBVIOUSLY sounds like a woman pretending to be an old man!! Why? Several characters are played by the same actor. Sometimes it work (Jeffrey Wright as the travel agent and Meryl Streep as Ethel Rosemberg) and sometimes it doesn't (Mary-Louise Parked as a homeless woman and Justin Kirk as a SM leather man in the park). Why?

Well... ANGELS IN AMERICA could have been a landmark.
It simply isn't.
It is beautifully produced and it has great moments. Every production value is right and you can clearly see a top director surrounded by top-everything...

Then it progressed to the conflict between homosexual segments of the Jewish culture and Mormon culture and Reagan White House culture--and every character began to speak in what became monologues--even though it was supposed to be dialogue. There were a lot of profound thoughts--but the writer seemed to be intent on making every line of ""dialogue"" a profound thought--and wasn't content to limit each character to a few profound thoughts at at time but had to string them all together in long lines of dialogue that morphed into monologue. Unfortunately, when one character rattles on for five minutes at a time, those profound thoughts begin to sound like the jabbering heard in a room full of drunks. By the time I got to the second disk I was sick of their proselytizing and decided this movie is one of the worst bunches of crap I've ever listened to. Yes, AIDS is a horrible disease--I've lost friends to it. Yes, the world population is killing itself over prejudice. No, I'm not a Reagan Republican--I was a university student in California when Reagan was govenor of the state.

2004018,5,B0001I2BUI,"Welcome to New York in Reagan's time, in the days when Reagan declared that AIDS was a divine punishment to homosexuals. And AIDS are taking their toll on gay men in New York City. All kinds, from the prudent to the careless, from the loving and lovable to the hateful and spiteful. But indeed the film is not about that, them and their types, or even those who can afford AZT or not.

It is about love and what love can be, how love can be revealed when confronted to some treachery, or what looks like some treachery though it is only fright in front of the disease for some or coming out of the closet for others. Add to that a new born homosexual who is a reaganite and a mormon at the same time, which is a lot against his new birth and a clear cut condemnation that will prevent him from being properly baptized and christened.

Add to that a mormon mother taken in the whirlwind and whirlpool of this revelation and confrontation to death and how she will be able to cope for one and even save the day of several of them, including her own son. But even so, that's only one little part of the film. It then plays on the visions some have, on the angels some can see, all angels of death. Those angels take the shape of Ethel Rosenberg for the lawyer who managed to get her death penalty.

The angels also take the shape of a real female angel with wings and all that is able to take a couple more to their death, lead them to the ladder, Jacob's ladder that leads straight up to heavens. But that both Christian and Jewish imagery and symbolism is not enough to satisfy the baroque taste of the director. Heaven is not going to be the garden you may think it is. It is a vast ruined temple and city where some clerk or even bureaucrats are managing the fate of the dead from behind a long table piled up with files and papers, and the prophet who is probably not as Jewish as many others refuses to abide by their decision and demands more life and he does go back to life, he resurrects in a way.

And this leads to the end of Reagan, of the cold war, the perestroika and Gorbachev, and a new era in the world. If only they could have known this new era was going to lead to eight years of absolutely nightmarish regression, two wars, and a lot of terrorism amplified and multiplied by the war-mongering of a vengeful tribe of American politicians who did not deserve to be appointed to their positions, and I say appointed since they were not elected properly, at least for those who should have been elected. In retrospect the joy of 1990, January 1990 mind you, hardly three months after the fall of the Berlin Wall was going to be rather short-lived and be buried in the sex-play of a president and then the bellicose vengeful adventures of another.

Altogether by far nearly sixteen years lost to the phantasms of two men. Yes the angels are in America, the angels of death that give you a wet dream first and lead you to death afterwards, the little death and the big death unified in one single jump into empty space and the fall through the cosmos. An amazing film that seems to reflect a whole period and at the same time to express the distantiation we have been able to build thanks to nearly twenty years of crisis and plain at times painful living.

Apparently, so has HBO. They won't show this again, but I can turn on and see ""Batman Returns"" any day of the week.  Go figure.

Adapted from Tony Kushner's prize-winning ""Angels in America/A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,"" Mike Nichols does a most superb job at directing this for the small screen.  A winner of 5 Golden Globes and several Emmys, the play (and movie) deal with the early discovery of AIDS and its affect (or lack thereof) on the Reagan administration.

The major characters are Joe Pitt (played by Patrick Wilson); Roy Cohn (played by Al Pacino); Ethel Rosenberg, et al. (played by Meryl Streep); The Angel, et al. (played by Emma thompson); Prior Walter (played by Justin Kirk); Belize (played by Jeffrey Wright); Harper Pitt (played by Mary-Louise Parker), and Ben Shenkman (played by Louis Ironson).  Meryl Streep is absolutely unbelievable in ANY role she plays here (as always).  Al Pacino is just as fantastic as Roy Cohn.  You just want to kill him, but (as the saying goes) he eventually gets what's coming to him.

Mary-Louise Parker defies description in her performance of the eternally depressed, pill-popping, wife-of-convenience, Harper Pitt.  Patrick Wilson plays her husband of convenience who is so brainwashed by regligion, he sets himself on a path where neither he nor anyone who comes to associate him will ever be happy--although he so desparately wants to be.  Justin Kirk plays the AIDS-ridden ""prophet,"" that the angels have decided to contact.  Too bad his agents or whomever it was involved with the movie thought only to nominate him as a supporting actor, when he is the main character in the play and movie.  When they tried to right their wrong, the votes were in and he wound up being nominated for nothing!  Jeffrey Wright reprised his role of Belize.

Although never preachy, this movie does deliver a very serious message:  that gay people have (and want) just as much rights to live as others.  Reagan had a great ability of burying his head in the sand on matters regarding AIDS, and it cost countless lives--both gay and straight.

This movie is divided into 6 parts, with a total running time of 352 minutes.  I could have watched double that time.  I loved it all.

It's not just the content, but the material is very unothodox, but remember this was a Pulitzer Prize winning play.  The standouts here are Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, they both are simply fantastic.  Streep plays several roles, one which you will be shocked to find out is her, Pacino plays only one, the devil incarnate, Roy Cohn, but he makes it the most memorable in the film; the dialogue between Pacino's Cohn and Steeps Rosenberg is fantastic and fascinating.  The main character, who is dealing with life with AIDS in the eighties is very well fleshed out, the actor playing him is very good, but his nebbish, Jewish partner is annoying as hell, not only is he a horrible person, but NOBODY could stand him for two minutes, much less four years, I could not understand what the main character ever saw in him..it sure was not looks, the guy looks like a bird of prey, uh think Vulture not Golden Eagle...the story about the mormon and his wife is the weakest in the movie, I found the Mormon guys story interesting, his confliction with being gay, married, Mormon and a Republican..(lord!!!)...but his wifes story and her hallucinations..which i didn't realize Vicodin could spawn..was just annoying to me..she was so shrill and uninteresting..but Streep as his mother was great.

Like a lot of plays adapted to film, sometimes the parlance of the speeches seem a bit stilted or ""play-like"", but somehow that doesn't detract much from the film, as it is a film about communication both said & unsaid. My major complaint about the film is that Pacino, Streep and Thompson get top billing in the film - when in fact that they're all essentially secondary characters - which is not to say that each wasn't brilliant in their roles ( and sometimes multiple roles - particularily Streep who surely outdoes herself in the film & certainly deserved an Emmy for her multi-performance ). Justin Kirk plays the lead Prior Walters - with a mix of love, pathos, fear and joy, yet doesn't even get listed in the box credits - for shame I say. Jeffrey Wright - also outstanding - deservedly won awards for his part in the film.

As a straight man working in San Francisco during the 80s and 90s, I watched the devastation this disease wreaked on friends, colleagues and strangers while the world ignored the issue.  This movie gave me an insight into some of the emotional and spiritual struggles of the human beings affected by AIDS.

'American Psycho', great as it was, had done me in and satisfied my anger. I don't think Mike Nichols hits one false note in this epic, and I was taken in by almost all of the performances.  Streep, Pacino and Wilson are stellar in hitting peak moments with grace; Parker is comical and endearing.  While so many films out there are as false as advertising on prime time TV, and exist as nothing but wallpaper to pass time and pacify the hoi polloi, I was so pleased to rent something with something valuable on its mind.  And no, it's not just another film about the Immune Deficiency years. It's about so much more. So much.  Mainly the rewards of forgiveness and reaching past one's grievances to see the reality of another person as oneself staring back at you.  And that's not a minor thing regardless of how jaded, postmodern, drowning-in-irony one may be.

No one else really talked about Belize played by Jeffrey Wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill (not to mention his amusing depiction of Mr. Lies). Watch his description of Heaven to Al Pacino's character very carefully, the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite. I think Justin Kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with Meryl Streep are great to watch. The production only falls short with Mary Louise Parker's character. She reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying. I wanted a little more passion and bite from her. Another disappointment is the sort of forced ending. Each character is forced to talk directly to the camera and it gets a bit too preachy and self concious of a movie/play.

To say that it revolves around a gay man who is suffering with AIDS, while true, does not give a fair idea of its content. The man does indeed encouter an angel, played by Emma Thompson. Also in the drama is Roy Cohn, himself dying of AIDS, and haunted by hallucinations in which Emma Rosenberg, the ""convicted atomic spy"", appears to him. The cast of this imaginative drama includes Emma Thompson, Meryl Streep, Jeffery Wright, and Al Pacino playing Roy Cohn. Each of these actors plays multiple roles. The entire cast is outstanding. The film treats Kutchner's play with great flair and visual imagination.

2004040,5,B0001I2BUI,"I'll be blunt: this miniseries nearly left me in pieces after I completed it in one night. I was tired and irritable thte following day at school, but it didn't matter. 'Angels' is one of the finest miniseries in recent memory, and like Roots, is an absolute must have for your library.

Capturing the 1980's in an entertaining fashion, the film centers around the lives of three groups: homosexual couple Louis and Prior, disgruntled husband/wife Joe and Harper (though Joe happens to be a closeted homosexual himself, and a mormon too--sheesh) and the notorious lawyer Roy Cohn.

As Prior is diagnosed with AIDS in a time when the disease was met with both fear and ignorance, Louis leaves him and seeks a relationship with Joe, all the while when his wife Harper is having what is either a series of hallucinations or heavenly visions--we are left to decide.

While in the throes of agonizing pain, Prior is visited by a true angel, sent from heaven to seek out "" the prophet"" in order to do good in a world that had gone so wrong.

The miniseries, six hours long, covers a multitude of topics, from AIDS and sexuality to mental illnes and politics, all the while never straying from its true path: to enlighten those who might have otherwise remained ignorant as to the millions of Americans who suffer from AIDS. For they truly are the Angels of America, citizens who face an uncertain future with the bravery and compassion that many of us will never come to know.

The performances are outstanding, featuring an all star cast of Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Patrick Wilson and Mary Louise Parker, to name a few. Truly a virtuoso performance by all those involved, they truly carried the miniseries to dizzying heights, and far exceeded my expectations.

While I would like to think one day this miniseries will be shown in High Schools across the country, for now, I absolutely insist that you either rent, purchase or borrow this work of art in the near future. Pieces like this only come around on very rare occassions, and when they do, we owe it to ourselves to give them the time they deserve!",1150070400,20,2101,4.6802168021680215

With that in mind, I'd like to offer some advice to those that may inadvertently rent/buy other movies:

There are no Cuckoo birds and no nests in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

There is no obvious wind in Gone With the Wind and what there was didn't blow anything away

There are few, if any, good fellas in Goodfellas

There are no lambs in Silence of the Lambs

Chinatown isn't set in a town in China

There is neither $1,000,000 nor a baby in Million Dollar Baby

You guessed it, no bulls in Raging Bull

The coats are made of denim or some such material in Full Metal Jacket

Paul Newman's body temperature is about 98.6 degrees just like the rest of us in Cool Hand Luke

There is little, if any, sleeping in The Big Sleep

The prison hallway is only a few feet long in The Green Mile

The African Queen is not about a gay black man

No waterfowl were hurt in the making of Duck Soup

The earth rotated as usual on the Day the Earth Stood Still

There are actually multiple conversations in The Conversation

The raunchy men's magazine does not appear in The Hustler

Nobody inherited the wind in Inherit the Wind. It still belongs to all of us

There is no discernible odor while watching The Sweet Smell of Success

All the President's Men is only about *some* of the president's men

I hope that some will find these simple reminders useful. If not, you may want to consider looking at the back of a DVD case, visiting your local library or going to one of the thousands of web sites that talk about every movie ever made.

As for this film, if you're not frightened by things that might be different than what you've experienced or that perhaps strike too close to home, and don't spend your time judging how everyone else lives, then there is much to love about this work. It may not be perfect, and there can be many legitimate gripes about it, but overall it's very, very good. Scan through the positive reviews here and you'll get a good sense of it. No need for me to repeat it all here. Unfortunately, most (but not all) of the negative reviews are just those with some sort of political/religious agenda to put forth instead of commenting on the film.",1149724800,23,2452,4.36644591611479
2004042,5,B0001I2BUI,"It never ceases to amaze me that people become so violently upset when art (whether it be film, television, paintings, or theater) does not take a ""balanced"" stance on an issue.  Art is ART, not fact.  Get over yourselves.  If you don't agree with what a particular piece of art has to say, then fine.  But there's no reason to write a 1500 word diatribe bashing the author, the performers, and the entire message because you don't agree with it.  Open your mind.  How can you appreciate any art otherwise?

All of this aside, Angels in America is a stunningly filmed and acted piece of personal storytelling.  It deftly manages the concept of the personal being political as it weaves the stories of the characters into and out of one another.  Angels understands the human condition - both physically and emotionally.  The story is not afraid to let people be sick, bleeding, hurt, and broken.  It is also not afraid to let them be racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, religious zealots or atheists.  The characters of Angels experience love, hate, fear, sadness, anger, anxiety, frustration, and pain.  Even without the overarching presence of the AIDS virus within the story, the characters of Angels clearly demonstrate the human condition in which we each find ourselves.  That's what's so amazing about this piece - even though it deals primarily with gay men and their relationships, it does't cast these people as only that.  These men (and a few women) demonstrate an number of behaviors to which each of us can relate - gay or straight, sick or not.  And, at some point, I'm sure we all would have liked to have an angel descend upon us to show us the way.... but Angels insists time and again that it is the human spirit and NOT the angels that will lead us out of darkness.  The human spirit is what conquers disease and develops relationships, it is what we use to teach one another and to console each other.  That is the lesson of Angels in America... and it is brilliantly portrayed.",1147564800,8,2003,4.706896551724138
2004043,4,B0001I2BUI,"One of the several angels in this film says, ""You ain't stupid. So don't ask stupid. Ask something for real."" She is saying that most people avoid complex truths in life, and instead they choose to cycle their brains in cursory pursuits. She encourages Harper to ask tougher, more real questions. And Harper complies by asking, ""In your experience of the world, how do people change?"" THAT is a tough question to answer. How do you get people to change any of their long ingrained patterns? THAT is an incredibly complex, intelligent, and real question.

Love finds ways to create bonds between the people in this film who start out perceiving they are adversaries. In this movie, angels, both heavenly and mortal, watch over and gaurd. They enlighten.

The movie asks: Should personal truths be expressed? No matter how horrible or sinful a person feels about them, does expressing them create less long term fear and harm than either silence or lies? Harper wants to know what her gay husband is doing while he is away from her. So she asks, ""Can I come with you? This isn't working anymore, I'm cold."" He says, ""I wouldn't want you to see."" She replies, ""You think it's worse than what I imagine? It's not."" It's not necessarily the fact that Harper's husband is gay that ends their relationship. It appears more likely that it is his dishonesty with Harper about his homosexuality, coupled with his denial and self-punishment within himself, and his inability to conceive how his feelings for both men and his wife can be reconciled well - that all combine to create the rifts between them. Yet Harper personally and truly loves him, despite all of that. I still believe that when she says her love for him is irreducibly real, she is being totally honest with herself and the audience.

Truth is messy. Truth is sometimes ""sin"" full. Truth is more complex than most people understand. The lead character concedes, ""I usually say f*#@ the truth, but usually the truth f#@*s you."" Personal truths don't often fit commonly promoted 'truths'. Regulary, personal truths are more complex than & contradictory with the status quo. And a person can say, ""F*#@ It!,"" but that is just giving up. It is an unintelligent conclusion because it allows the status quo to universally trump personal truths. And the status quo should not be allowed to do that to beautiful and uncommon individuals.

To quote Billy Joel, ""You can say the human heart is only make belief, but that is only fighting fire with fire."" That quote for me has always meant: You can deny your feelings. You can say that your 'Emotions are just getting the best of you,' but that suggests there is no personal truth creating your personal emotions. And I've usually found that emotions are not just stupid chemical responses; rather, there are usually great, natural reasons why emotions effect us so strongly. And if a person incorrectly labels those emotions as selfish or fallen, they may be misidentifying their body's good natural responses, responses that are trying to fight to build and create loving relationships, even if those relationships are not in line with the status quo.

The movie encourages NOT being silent. The leading gay protanonist, in his final great speech, having survived living with AIDS for several years, says of homosexuals and outcasts in general, ""We will not die silent deaths anymore."" Change cannot come without discussion. And the forces that don't want change will call for silence because discussing real, complex moral ideas can change the world.",1144886400,,3550,4.900166389351082

Angels in America is modern magical realism; it has intensely serious moments and delightfully ridiculous moments as well. Though some of the situations fell a little flat and some of the dialogue got a little vague or wordy, this film makes up for its own flaws. I had to watch it twice to catch all of the cleverness.

I loved Emma Thompson in all three of her roles, and Meryl Streep as well. I found Al Pacino a bit hammy but he usually is. The rest of the cast was also perfect.

My rating is only 2 mostly because I was not interested in the topic.  However, it was extremely well acted.  The story was also complex with complex characters and overall was well done.

However, it is obvious that the writer had created a story he wanted to share but didn't have an ending.  The angel and heaven scenes near the end were horrendously hokey.  Some characters at the end stepped out of character to give little speeches that seemed very corny especially out of place against the superb acting that was displayed through the rest of the movie.

There wasn't as much liberal preachiness as other are complaining there is.  Not that there isn't liberal venom sprinkled throughout the movie. It just doesn't dominate as others claim.  Mostly the focus is on the characters.

The end does have a very vile liberal view though that I assume is the view of the writer of this.  A Jewish person spouts an antisemetic talking point about how ""Israel has a right to exist EXCEPT for the Palistinian's areas.""  Of course, I wouldn't be surprised if the writer himself isn't Jewish himself holding these same monstrously immoral antisemetic liberal views.",1137024000,2,1399,4.703703703703703

2004051,5,B0001I2BUI,"In spite of a few imperfection (intentional or otherwise) ""Angels in America"" was one of the most original and heartfelt works to have graced the American stage. AiA, the film, ably brings the play to the screen. It is original. It is funny. It is poignant. It is crude and even blasphemous. Above all it is honest. It is everything a non-religious religious movie ought to be.

In Ronald Reagan's America, the AIDS epidemic was cutting down young gay lives at a furious clip. Caught between the spread of a virulent infection and a society that relegated it to the margins, the [...] community was reeling. Treatments were rare, and those that existed were limited to drug trials, to which only the very lucky or the very powerful had access. It's against this backdrop of death and identity that AiA is set.

Playwright Tony Kushner does not paint every gay character as a saint or a hero. Some are power-mad, some cowardly, some just trying to survive, while some step up in best Florence Nightingale fashion to alleviate pain and bring hope. The film cuts between sets of lovers. Prior is suffering with AIDS, but his squeamish friend Louis (great when it comes to pronouncing sweeping theories) is unable to support Prior during his illness. A young Mormon couple-Joe and Harper-struggle through madness and a sexless marriage, mostly due to Joe's inability to accept his own sexuality. Al Pacino, in an Oscar-worthy performance, plays Roy Cohn as a man in love with himself and with power, who vehemently denies his [...], even as his body is being ravaged by HIV/AIDS. Throughout the personal struggles, the principals are beset by visions that challenge them, comfort them and give meaning to their suffering. Meryl Streep is perfect as Ethel Rosenberg-the voice of Kohn's withered conscience-whom an overzealous Kohn had railroaded (as AIA tells it) to the gas chamber. Prior is visited by Emma Thompson, as an angel who proclaims him a prophet. Harper retreats into drugged-out hallucinations that protect her from her own feelings of uselessness and worthless. Special mention goes to Jeffrey Wright, who plays nurse Belize, who ministers to his sick friends (and enemies) while doling out tough love that keeps them grounded in reality.

Redemption for these characters comes in facing truths about their characters. Those who accept the truth find peace and love; those who reject it, like Cohn, are doomed to die alone in their lies.

AiA is a masterpiece that uses the AIDS epidemic to strip away the masks of self-delusion and falsity that are the hallmark of humanity and the special curse of [...] in a homophobic society. The film's depictions of gay sexuality are frank and not always pretty. But by exposing the inner, hidden core of [...] humanity, the film shows [...] as persons of full human dignity who do not deserve suffering and death, but who soldier through its ravages with grace, love and courage.",1135641600,,2930,4.9371196754563895
2004052,4,B0001I2BUI,"There are no extras on the DVD package, not even the obligatory HBO Presents documentary they do for other films.  Otherwise, the positive elements are the cover art, and the basic 2-disk box.  When it comes to the casting, the famous leads did not produce the best work in this series, let alone the best work of their careers, but they earned the accolades anyway.  They were marquee value.  However, Al Pacino does perform subtle work in his scenes with Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson), a would-be son or convert, whom he is attempting to seduce to the dark side professionally and into a sexual relationship personally, but so refined about it, even the target doesn't have a clue: The editing spotlights Pacino's stroking Wilson's shoulder more than once to make sure the audience gets what is really going on.  Often, though, Pacino is merely yelling at the top of his lungs as the serpent morphs into a spoiled brat.  When it comes to Meryl Streep, with multiple roles, she is typical Meryl Streep, and nothing to be said for or against.  She is just there.  Emma Thompson is forgettable as a nurse, yet wonderful - even incandescent - as the angel who is visiting the ""prophet"" character of Pryor as he sinks in health due to AIDS.  And another multiple-part actor is Jeffrey Wright, who is appearing all over the place here, but most important as Pryor's friend and Cohn's (Pacino's) nurse.  But there is no reasonable excuse for having the multiple parts as-played-by-a-few-actors gimmick, not in the HBO production.  This hurts the drama, though a case may be made that Emma is a sympathetic nurse and therefore assumes the guise of angel in Pryor's heated visions for that reason.  As the nurse, she is there to witness Pryor's lover's abandonment.  Why Streep would be a fifties' casualty as well as a concerned Mormon mother, I have no idea, as there is no link.  The best lead acting comes from the actors Justin Kirk and Patrick Wilson, with Kirk as Pryor railing against his fate and his abandonment by his lover - Louis - and Wilson as Pitt, trying to reconcile the fact he is striving to be a perfect Mormon while also facing his attraction to men, and the fact he can't keep his wife satisfied, no matter how much he sublimates his true desires. He is the character having to face guilt whether he stays on with his current lifestyle or starts a new one.  Complicating Pitt's decision process is his fear of abandoning his wife, Harper, who has a chemical dependency problem only more pronounced by her sexual frustration (she knows her hunky husband doesn't want her sexually; hell, even his nickname for her is 'buddy' and you can't get less sexual than that).  So you have two characters hallucinating, Pryor and Harper, as they are the physically ailing ones suffering issues of abandonment and betrayal.  Mary-Louise Parker as Harper is the same dry-wit sorry-for-myself character she has made a career of playing, it's become her schtick, and her most affecting scene is probably when she's facing her mother-in-law and pointing out the mannequin which has the same face as her husband - and the mannequin is representing the ideal of Mormon male heading out to new territory in spite of the dangers en route (Utah).  In reality, Harper is on her own as her husband is investigating his new lifestyle like a committed zealot - but this is a journey Harper can't take with him. As a break from all the drama, most of the Harper and Pryor scenes are played for laughs, even Pryor's first glimpse of ""malboro man"" Pitt (Wilson).  But Justin Kirk is able to utilize the liberation his character has so he seems the only person having fun.  Patrick Wilson has the most complicated multi-dimensional character (the rest are two-dimensional) as we follow his agonizing cycle.  For those keeping track, Kirk and Wilson do the stripping in the film, for Wilson maybe by rote a stripping as he did in the Broadway musical ""The Full Monty,"" only this is for dramatic emphasis, even desperation, as his character is illustrating the breakthrough he has made, shedding his skin (clothing) literally and figuratively, removing even the underwear which is part of the Mormon uniform.  The overall weakness of the play working against this splendid cast and all their efforts is the glorification of socialism against conservatism, in a quite simplistic sort of way - ANGELS IN AMERICA is truly a black-and-white film.  And the ending of the film, which deals with certain characters' fates and not others, is sloppy.  Finally, the immature intolerance displayed in the character of Louis, which hardly makes him the knight in shining armor I think the writer intends, perhaps the alter-ego of the author himself, makes a POV so pretentious seem quite childish.  So it was a well-done, well-filmed production, with loads of small weaknesses.",1134345600,4,4845,4.836561743341404
2004053,2,B0001I2BUI,"I deeply regret not being able to give this version of ""Angels in America"" more than two stars. I'd heard good things about Tony Kushner's play, and given the A-List actors chosen for the screen, I expected more. Or should I say less? By that I mean that HBO on a bloated budget is a red flag for an over-long and over-indulgent piece of dreck. It's quite frankly shameful to waste time, money and talent in such a way. ""Angels in America"", by trying to be everything by going in dozens of different directions at once, naturally ends up being nothing and going nowhere. Is this a speechifying morality play? Is this a child's 'special effects' fantasy? Is this a showcase for actors to experiment? (Uh, why was Meryl Streep cast as the aged rabbi again?) Is this a repository of left over bits and pieces from other projects? Because it IS that incoherent, and I can't shake the feeling that this whole effort was done frivolously, like on a bet or something. As in, ""Let's just see how silly we can be, and how the masses will still suck up to us!"" DISCRIMINATING VIEWER ALERT: Don't fall into this trap!",1134086400,11,1106,4.507462686567164
2004054,4,B0001I2BUI,"I sometimes wonder if some people bother to consider and genuinely think through what they're typing for sites like this. If they are ""genuine"", and not just ranting for the sake of it, I begin to wonder where these people come from, what their cultural location is. One of the eventualities of living in an age that is so besotted with the internet, with ""open forums"", is that now everyone can have their say, every social or political rant can ""be heard"", so to speak. The internet and some of the exclamatory fragments that become available through its medium (even at shopping sites like Amazon!?!) can become an interesting barometer of conservative hysteria and reaction. The review below mine was clearly written by someone articulate. Its content is, however, alarming and deluded. Tony Kushner is a ""socialist"" and ""Angels in America"" is couched in ""Communist"" rhetoric? Kushner is against American ""free society"", ""freedom of choice"" and ""liberalism"", is dangerously opposed to the ""American dream"" (etc.,etc.)?

What I always find interesting about rants like this is that words such as ""Free Society"", ""Patriotism"", ""Democracy"" (etc.) are always taken to be transparent, un-problematic terms in an immutable binary opposition, posited as ""right"" and ""normal"", with the other terms (""Communism"", ""Socialism"", the ""Left"") are ""abnormal"", ""wrong"" and deviant. ""Angels in America"" deals precisely with the [O]ther term in the opposition: ""homosexual"", ""AIDS"", ""Black"", ""Jew"", ""leftism"" (not analogous to ""Communism"" by the way) in the face of the monolithic American conservatism of the 1980's that would ignore it. The reviewer below would crush Kushner's voice for being ""anti-patriotic"", hence ""anti-American"" while the film itself deals precisely with marginal communities that will not and CANNOT be recuperated into the kind of America that the reviewer un-problematically seems to posit as the ""Real America"". This image of America does not really have ""free will"" as its basis, as the reviewer would have us believe (via Walt Whitman!), but rather ""conformity"". I think people like this reviewer are so reductive, conservative, ""silencing"" and uncompromisingly ""faithful"" in their thinking that they are the dangerous ones, not Kushner and his justly oppositional voice. Although the terms in the opposition have changed (somewhat) since the 1980's - to get into it would require more space than is available here -  the terrifying conservatism of the 80's is still with us. Not much changes. We still know our enemies.",1133481600,7,2536,5.369346733668341
2004055,1,B0001I2BUI,"Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"" is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. Not so much for the pathetic list of self-loathing characters that are paraded before the hapless viewer, but for its sickening moralizing that American culture is to blame for all the world's woes, including AIDS. Kushner, a self-proclaimed socialist, doesn't condemn America for being not liberal enough; he criticizes America for being too liberal. ""Angels in America"" exposes an intense anger toward a society that permits far too much liberty. Living in a free society means one has to be responsible for one's own actions--and this Kushner detests. Freedom of choice means one might make the wrong decision. In America one has to weigh one's choices and live with the consequences. If you choose to go to a gay bath house and engage in sex with strangers rather than go to the library and read a volume of Walt Whitman's poetry, there will be different consequences for your actions. The freedom is yours. But Kushner hates freedom. Hence, his love affair with communist spy Ethel Rosenberg. Kushner conjures up dead communist spy Ethel Rosenberg in the form of an angel (played by Meryl Streep) who visits a suffering AIDS patient. His saintly portrayal of a woman who sold American military secrets to Soviets during the 1950 reveals just how deep Kushner's contempt for American society lies. Although Kushner only sees evil at all levels of American society, it was in socialist Cuba where dictator Fidel Castro was putting homosexuals in mental hospitals and prisons in order to contain AIDS there. Kushner accepts these Draconian actions taken by Castro. Papa Castro and Kushner are of the same ilk. It is free will and liberty which are the villains. Society needs restraints, defined moral structures, a ""papa"" to tell us from right and wrong so that we do not end up making the wrong choices. It is telling that the only redeemable character in this film is a masculine, independent, self-sufficient professional attorney and Mormon who has come to openly accept his homosexuality. This character is the ""all-American"" male: good-looking, strong, virile, self-sufficient, capable of making his own way. But in Kushner's world, these are evil attributes. In typical Leftist fashion, self-sufficiency, strength and independence are vilified as ""bourgeois"" and the character is degraded for failing to understand the ""big picture"" of socialist Utopianism. But whatever the case, the crux of ""Angels in America"" (the Angels, by the way, are the communists who walk among us evil capitalists) is a complete hatred for freedom and individuality. Do not be fooled by the subject matter into accepting Kushner's anti-American rants. People who liked this film are simple-minded sophists who think Oprah is more knowledgable on world affairs than Milton Freidman. For radicals like Kushner, all issues are reasons to perpetuate the communist ""dream.""",1131840000,38,2943,5.197894736842105

I sat down to watch it, expecting the usual stagey-ness of most filmed plays, fully expecting to be unimpressed despite its reputation (I'd been fooled by fawning ""theater people"" one too many times).  Six raptured hours later, I emerged from Tony Kushner's (book and screenplay), Mike Nichol's (director), and Thomas Newman's (music) masterpiece, changed forever as a human being.",1129852800,5,615,5.019607843137255
2004057,5,B0001I2BUI,"There are so many things to say about ANGELS IN AMERICA, but each of them is as difficult to put into words as the last.  To all of those who found this 6-hour adaptation of the play boring, consider looking beyond the superficial oddness and confusing nature of the story to its core.  When you dig down deep, ANGELS is a story about coping with life, with heartbreak, with disease, and learning what it means to be human.

With this said, ANGELS is anything but easy to understand.  Its references are as complex as they are hard-hitting, and it is as unforgivingly brutal in its honesty as it is right on the money.  The AIDS epidemic of the mid-1980s is the focus of the work -- but on a broader level, it's a study of how individuals live and function in modern day America.  The constant political references are apt to confuse all except the most politically-minded -- myself included -- so you may have to do a little reading and research to best understand the myriad references found herein.  Still, ANGELS is a full-force criticism of political neglect and ignorance -- things which still abound today.

The storyline being as complex as it is, it's astounding to see such superb performances from the cast.  Pacino, Streep, Thompson, Kirk, Shenkman, Parker, and Wright give brilliant performances that should not be missed.  The anguish and strife of the time, combined with the difficulties of relationships and dealing with situations we simply have no control over, make this film a masterpiece of modern cinema.

Make no mistake -- this film is not something you should watch with the assumption that you'll leave it with a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your heart.  It's honesty is piercing, and its sadness nearly heartbreaking.  Still, there is always hope -- we have an incredible resistance to change, and yet we're amazingly resilient creatures.  For better and for worse, we fight for what we believe -- as Prior says, we refuse to lay down anymore, to suffer and die in secrecy.

With unsurpassed poignancy, Kushner produces a tale that is sometimes funny and often heartwrenching.  Thomas Newman's delicate compositions ring true in the background, as well -- his soundtrack is compelling and truly breathtaking.  Prepare yourself for a brilliant work that won't leave your mind anytime soon -- if ever.",1128729600,10,2339,4.836683417085427
2004058,2,B0001I2BUI,"I remember sitting in a Barnes & Noble and reading each part of ANGELS IN AMERICA in the '90s and wondering how it would play onstage.  The dialogue was wonderful and, even without seeing an actor as Roy Cohn, some scenes just jumped right off the page.

When I heard that HBO was sinking tens of millions of dollars into a mini-series of it, I was afraid that their worst tendencies would overwhelm the production.

And it did, for the most part.

If they wanted to rip it up with the surreal angel scenes, they should've got the deranged English director Ken Russell (ALTERED STATES, TOMMY) instead of the socially-conscious Mike Nichols.  But I'm sure Russell would've also monkeyed with the rest of the play's carefully crafted messages.  (To be honest, I don't wish Russell on anybody: read the bio of legendary screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky to see that).

And what did the angel scenes really lead up to?  The ""prophet"" she announces climbs the ladder into Heaven...and tells God what he can do with it.  All the hours of weaving a complex story of personal human interaction are capped off with the sullen petulance of a child-like reproach.

It is revealing as a mentality (""Nothing Is My Fault""), but as drama it doesn't work as well.

But a lot of scenes really work and the cast is great, but the ending is a let-down.  And some of the hallucinations are just indulgent messes.

I've watched shows like ANGELS IN AMERICA and AND THE BAND PLAYED ON (the book was infinitely better), and I've noticed a lot of historical revisionism going on: Ronald Reagan was NOT responsible for the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's.  I was there and saw it: at the news of a new ""gay disease"" striking down gays in San Francisco and New York, the Reagan Administration ordered the bathhouses in Frisco shut down until the situation could be evaluated...and the gays just about burned City Hall to the ground to keep them open.  And for the virus to spread even more.

In 1987 or '88, the USA spent $700 million dollars on AIDS research and $77 million on breast cancer research, the leading cause of death for women.  That was in USA Today.

When I see desperate characters in movies like ANGELS IN AMERICA berating the government for ""not caring"" about what's happening, I remember the truth: the people most at risk didn't allow anyone to care.

They screamed for help while pushing it away.",1127088000,14,2382,4.655502392344498
2004059,5,B0001I2BUI,"""Angels in America"" is not merely a great play, like ""Our Town,"" ""Death of a Salesman,"" ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" it is one of the defining dramas of the American theatre - an absulte masterpiece - with a title now immediately recognised internationally by the common man.

This screen adaptation by Tony Kushner and Mike Nichols is an incredible achievement.  Having read the play, and having seen it on stage, I was still unprepared for this epic production.  I started crying during the first scenes.  Streep's speech at the funeral - the eulogy - was so emotional I couldn't hold back my tears.  It sounds so silly to say that Meryl Streep and Al Pacino are masterful, they're legends after all.  Still, their work here reminds everyone of their status and why they are so deservedly praised and heaped with so many accolades.  The rest of cast is outstanding.  Mary Louise Parker and Jeffrey Wright won both the Emmy Award and Golden Globes (as did Streep and Pacino) and are staggeringly good, as are Ben Shankman, Patrick Wilson and Emma Thompson.

Kushner's writing is simply brilliant.  Nichols direction is inspired (how could it not be?).  Every single production element is award caliber.  Thomas Newman deserves special praise for his haunting musical score.  Words like landmark and masterpiece seems inadeqaute.

2004066,5,B0001I2BUI,"I've read the other reviews, and am surprised that so many people missed so much! I was epecially annoyed that one reviewer mentioned that it was ""dated""; this can only be attributed to the brilliant Mike Nichols creating a period piece (the '80's). The immense amount of subtle humor certainly alleviated the grotesque allegory that was taking place. Without that element, this would've been downer-city. Example, Prior (Justin Kirk) wrestles with the Angel (Emma Thompson), and when it's over, the angel announces that she pulled a muscle and needs a break. Also, my favorite, Joe's Mormon mother (Meryl Streep) asks Prior if he's a hairdresser. He responds, saying that if he was, it'd be her luckiest day. Even the evil Roy Cohn (Pacino) makes jest of his plight. And then there's Streep as the cynical rabbi. I was very amused and entertained. My point is, that if you think this is a downer about HIV/AIDS, it covers much more than that. Motivations are explored, as in the relationship of Prior and Louis (Ben Shenkman); as well as the Mormon couple, Joe (Patrick Wilson) and Harper (Mary-Louise Parker). As far as the complaints I'd read about the dialogue, I thought every line of delivery by all of the above-mentioned was real and sincere...Emma's, however, was written to be interpreted by Prior, the ultimate drama queen, as he saw it. ""Angels in America"", as presented on HBO and directed by Nichols, is breathtakingly powerful. At 6 hours, it never fails to entertain. I'd had the DVD since March, when it was first released. I only watched it the other day, waiting for the right time to absorb the whole thing. And, yes, now I must watch it again (as a previous reviewer recommended).  This was nominated for practically every Golden Globe, Emmy, etc., that was available. The many fine male performances I'm sure caused confusion (leading/supporting?). I was impressed with Pacino, Streep and the wonderful Jeffrey Wright (as another sort of Angel), and EVERYONE involved, but in the long run, I was most impressed with Justin Kirk as Prior. He had the toughest part, and was seamless in his portrayal, so very  diverse. This is monumental in its achievement, and I wish everyone could see it to get a feeling of the attitudes at the beginning of the AIDS crisis. One nice thing about the film/play, is that, with the exception of Roy Cohn, everyone is a nice person at heart. My complaint about the DVD, especially at the price, is that there are absolutely NO extras. Commentary from any of the brilliant talents involved would be welcome, as well as a chapter-selection that allowed getting into and out of each of the 6 chapters.

2004067,2,B0001I2BUI,"In The Western Canon, Harold Bloom, probably the most influential - and some say greatest - critic, listed Angels in America (the play)as one of the important works. As a play, I see how it may work - great metaphorical, beautiful language and sometimes in iambic pentameter - very Shakespeare.

But adapted to screen, I think it is the language that fails. It sounds contrived and unnatural. When Shakespeare's plays are transposed to films, the directors often find new ways, new settings, new mise-en-scene to match the metaphoric language but in the case of Angels in America (the series), the director does not and that's where it fails.

Another thing that I do not understand is why Al Pacino is given the best actor in the Golden Globe over Douglas Kirk who plays a more central and convincing role.

Not that Streep's character doesn't tow her own worldly baggage, but her ordinary yet not unquestioning life contrasts well with the troubled complications of the other characters. She's like a sigh of relief when all else is bated breath. Somewhere deeply involved in the second half, I had to ask myself if I'm enjoying the film because of the creativity involved or is this merely a good soap opera? And were the surreal scenes of a frustrated wife stepping into La-La Land, angels crashing through hospital ceilings, and the ghost of U.S. assasinated convicted spy Ethel Rosenberg walking around and offering advice, effective or merely indulgent? There's also a strange morality working here; a perceived as evil AIDS patient succumbs to the illness, while a good-hearted one survives; out and proud homosexuals are made heroic while a troubled one, guilted by his religious upbringing, is left out in the cold.

2004077,4,B0001I2BUI,"The Tony Award winning smash becomes an ambitious 6 hour mini-series.  I've been interested in viewing this work for over 10 years.  I'm not sure if the Broadway version is better, but if it's what I think, this is an acting  powerhouse.  It's a bold look at gay life and the AIDS epidemic in the mid-1980's.  I found it incredible that Tony Kushner used a real life character (Roy Kohn) in a fiction story and it worked like a charm.  Here's my review.

Millenium Approaches - ***** stars!

Clearly my favorite!  The performances by Pacino, Streep, Wright and Parker were outstanding.  The ending sequence is just breathtaking.

Perstroyka - *** stars!

The second part is somewhat disappointing in that it gets obsurdly ridiculous with Prior vision in heaven.  The acting is still wonderful.

Overall rating - **** stars for the wonderful performances by all.  The music by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile) is outstanding.  He's probably the best composer in the business today.  This is a moving story with unforgetable characters.  It's a story you won't soon forget!",1112054400,3,1087,4.977653631284916

2004079,5,B0001I2BUI,"I sat down one Saturday evening 2 hours before I was to go out on the town (and enjoy Los Angeles' incredible dining and nightlife)and began watching Angels in America part 1 on HBO.....I sat transfixed and still for 3 hours and cancelled my plans to go out 1 1/2 hours before it ended, I COULD NOT PULL MYSELF AWAY. I was expecting part 2 to follow and was extremely disappointed to learn it wasn't showing. The next day I ran out and bought the DVD and sat for another 3 hours during part 2 transfixed.

It has taken me 2 weeks to sit down and write this review, I just could not find the words to do it and still find it difficult to do now. I am not going to go into any detail about the plot or the incredible characters as one can read plenty of excellent reviews from excellent reviewers on these matters below..of which I am pleased to see 95% are good, and deservedly so. I merely want to say how it made me feel and that this film moved me in a way very few that have preceeded it have. This movie made me feel practically every human emotion there is...which is a little scary being that few films or plays can do such a thing. Is it tragic? yes, is it hopeful? yes, is it funny? yes, serious? yes, boring? never. Is it about gay men dying of AIDS? yes....but that is only on the surface, it is about SO much more than that. It is about people (gay and straight)and our not so sometimes perfect journey through life in this very uncertain and frequently ugly world. At the risk of sounding cliched or cheezy this movie has changed something in me, forever. It makes one want to be a better person, to not be fearful and angry at what we don't understand or hate, rather we should should strive to be compasionate and understanding...even of the things or people we might loathe.

If you have adverse feelings towards discussions on religion, philosophy,politics,love,death,abandonment,self discovery,the American dream,disease,race,drugs,devotion,homosexuals, and INCREDIBLE dialogue that borders on Shakespearean you probably won't like this film, however, you should watch it! It may make you see something different..in a different light. Don't be biased, check that at the door and watch with an open, forward thinking mind.

I am 28 years old and barely remember the outbreak of AIDS in the early 80's and I also barely remember the Reagan years. I am pretty well educated in politics and history though...but you want need to be....if you are human you will understand. My only regret is that I did not get to see this Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway sensation of the 90's on stage. If it is ever revived on Broadway I will pay what ever the cost to see it.

There are Angels in America, the angels are us.

Bravo HBO...incredible!",1110326400,19,2757,4.5728744939271255
2004080,3,B0001I2BUI,"The jury is still out.  I admit, while watching the film, especially the second part, I said aloud - this is @#$%ing stupid.  The plot was contrived, at times, and downright silly.

But I have to say, I was left with enough of an impression of the thing to be thinking about it quite a bit.  Having watched it alone, I couldn't wait to talk with someone about the story - to check in and see what others thought.  I read nearly every review here.  I guess I remain on the fence between those who praised it outright, and those who lack imagination.  Then there are the reviewers who simply lack any compassion or tolerance of diversity.  I admit that the gay characters seem whiny, as some reviewers wrote - but isn't drama often about exaggerating characters?  Has anyone read Dickens, for God's sake?  Every one of them was bigger than life, more evil than the devil, or kinder than all the saints.  Since when has entertainment been about realism?  Get over it!

I think it's really a combination of ""Philadelphia"" meets ""Dogma"" in some ways.  The religious depictions were disturbing - but I think in a good way.  I'm sick of having religious ""standards"" crammed down my thoat.  The concept here of God walking away from over-sexed angels throws a curve ball - inventive, refreshing and so naughty!

I agree with some reviewers about the packaging and rating.  I was surprised, but not offended by the frontal nudity of both men and women, and by the graphic sexual scenes.  Anyone who rents this thinking it's a spiritual/religious film - will be soon surprised!  I think it should be labeled appropriately.

Finally, unlike some, I did find hope in the ending.  So Prior didn't become a prophet - in other words, he didn't die, to end the suffering.  Isn't human nature meant to struggle to survive?  I think he did the noble thing and tried to keep living, even under the most harsh circumstances.  The ending, I thought, wasn't forced and preachy.  It was redemptive.  I felt hope for humankind.  So there.

The jury is out.  Until I can either recommend the movie to friends, or denounce its value, I can't really take a stand.  Rent it and see for yourself.",1109635200,22,2167,4.608923884514436

While there are certainly legitimate criticisms that can be made (e.g., the dramatic tension doesn't always unfold consistently, and the long speeches would benefit from a red pencil in places) it's rare to find a movie that offers such intelligent dramatic fodder for the actors, or that stretches the imagination so vividly.

2004085,5,B0001I2BUI,"This film version of Angels in America is an exceptional accomplishment. The production and acting were superb, possibly some of the best caught on film. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of playing the dying Roy Cohn. Meryl Streep is magnificent playing both the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg and the Mormon matron, Hannah Pitt. Mary Louise Parker plays the Mormon housewife struggling with a gay husband while also struggling with her sanity. Justin Kirk is superb as Prior, a gay man dying of AIDS while also dealing with the abandonment by his partner, Lewis. Patrick Wilson suffers through the guilt of leaving his wife, telling his mother about his sexual orientation, while being propelled into the energy of his new gay identity.  All the other actors were superb but Streep and Pacino were extremely powerful and moving.

The script is poetic, much like Shakespeare in beauty, fluidity, and emotional penetration. Therefore the viewer should not expect realistic naturalistic dialogue. The stage is often more suited for the poetic than is the screen, but Mike Nichols stayed true to the message and kept the beautiful dialogue as originally written. The language is so stimulating that I suggest the viewer have a copy of screenplay nearby so they can re-experience the lines.

What is this play about? It is about AIDS, conservative politics, history, relationships, self awareness, religion, theology, love, forgiveness, survival and transcendence.

What are the angels? They are the ever expanding idea of freedom. Only a genius of Kushner's standing could equate the movement of the Mormon's to Utah to gain religious freedom, with the modern gay civil rights movement, with the rise of Gorbachev and the fall of the Soviet Union.

What is the central theme? The tension between our duty and responsibilities to others and the duty and responsibility to be true to ourself. Joe and Lewis both struggle with this dilemna which is the central armature of the play. However upon that armature hangs far more pain and history that almost any other theatrical production.

I strongly recommend this production and wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

2004086,3,B0001I2BUI,"I have to agree with a number of the reviewers here that, while ""Angels in America"" is a noble effort, it is flawed due to the theatricality of the dialogue, frequent heavy-handedness in making its points, and a some acting weaknesses. While the angels and other examples of the supernatural are a central element of the film, I feel that they almost could have been eliminated. Take away Emma Thompson's angel and the other visions of Prior Walter, take away some of the lame made-for-tv-melodrama among the young gay men, take away Mary-Louise Parker's annoying characterization of gay Mormon lawyer's wife and you could have had an effective three hour film. I won't go into explaining all these elements because I assume that most reviewers have seen this film and simply want to express their opinion.  You could have had a great story centering on a scaled back account of Prior and Lou and Joe (with a different actress as his wife), Al Pacino as Roy Cohn, Meryl Streep as Joe's mother, and Jeffrey Wright as the nurse (forget about his  silly other role oboe-playing guide to Parker's supernatural excursions.  OK. Keep in the few minutes of Streep as a aged rabbi. That was good.  I like Emma Thompson but the film did not need her in the roles of a doctor (her accent doesn't work) and a street person and it DID NOT need her as the angel, because the film did NOT need the angel.  That said. Pacino steals the show as Roy Cohn and Streep is brilliant in all of her roles. (OK> I would keep her Ethel Rosenberg in Cohn's hallucinating.)  As to all the attacks on conservatives, RIGHT ON, but those could have been edited down. There were just too many flaws in this film and I found getting through it an endurance test, so much so that I would leave the DVD running while going to the kitchen to fix a snack.",1105488000,12,1819,4.530487804878049
2004087,3,B0001I2BUI,"I wanted to like this mini-series more than I did.  Unfortunately, quite a bit of it did not translate as well on television as it did on stage. Biggest quibble, much of the dialogue did not translate well onto the smaller medium.

I have to admit that I am surprised at the vitriol and hatred of some of the reviews this film has received.  I suppose that much of the ill will towards PWA that existed in the 80's has not gone away. My advice, if you are a homophobe do not watch this movie, and if you do watch it don't complain about gay characters. One more thing, this film is not lying about the way that the AIDS pandemic has been treated by the Republicans and much of America. Let them complain about revisionist history, but the conservatives are the one's doing all the revising on the topic of AIDS.  This film is the true (if somewhat surrealist) story of what actually happened.

2004088,5,B0001I2BUI,"I honestly didn't know if I wanted to see the quintessential AIDS movie.  It seems that so much of the already-scant gay movie/theater aresenal from the 90's focused relentlessly on AIDS and its impact on the community.  I needed to grow up.

In the gay community, there are many different forms of 'haves' and 'have-nots' but none more palpable than those living with or without AIDS in their lives.  This absolutely beautiful series did what so many others have failed to do - put AIDS into context with so many other things that people have to deal with in life.  Denial, deception, religion, politics, love and, most importantly, forgiveness.

For those who see things through just one lens, you could easily classify this epic tale as one -just- about any one of these topics, but as a whole it is so much more.  Through absolutely brilliant acting, direction and the creativity of Kushner's work, this tale comes to life as one, ultimately, of hope.

As a gay man who has survived the 90's and seen so many lost, I suppose I'm predisposed to embrace such a beautiful work, but it's my hope that many others who have little or no direct knowledge of this epidemic will embrace it with open arms and, if nothing else, see the beauty in artistic form that was borne of such a despondent time in the lives of so many.",1105228800,8,1319,4.582978723404255

2004090,5,B0001I2BUI,"There have been few movies that deserve the ratings this movie deserves.  Never before have I seen such exquisite hatred from Hollywood that covers all the bases like this movie does.  Conservatives, Religion, Republicans - all slammed effectively in one single movie that serves only one single purpose - to deceive.  It is pure genius how Republicans are singled out and actually blamed for the AIDS epidemic, despite how Republicans have never promoted homosexuality and drug use - the very means by which AIDS initially spread like wildfire during the 80s and early 90s (a fact we all remember very well).  This movie is truly worthy of the Michael Moore stamp of approval in first rate propaganda and disregard for anything sacred.  It is also a brilliant example of perfectly deceptive packaging - just look at that cover!  It will surely fool unsuspecting right-wing families into buying/renting it because it masks itself as some kind of Mel Gibson or Walt Disney movie, complete with zero description on the back of the cover as to what this movie actually contains (a brilliant plan to convert those right-wingers to liberalsim by tricking them).  It also does a fantastic job of getting Mormonism completely wrong (Mormons, remember, faithfully refuse to abandon Leviticus 18:22, a COMMANDMENT that AIDS seems to magnify).  About every concievable innacuracy one could conjure up about a religion is present in this movie while promoting a lifestyle that, if all practiced it, would doom the entire human race to extinction in a single generation due to lack of reproduction.  A new low that should earn Hollywood the notoriety they so desire and certainly earn in spades with this triumph of cinematic flatulence.  The utter degenerate state of humanity that this movie portrays truly serves the liberal agenda.  But it also serves the conservative agenda even more, doggone it.  For you see, as Hollywood continues it's downward spiral into the toilet, offending nearly everyone under the sun in the process, conservatives eagerly anticipate the next series of elections in which the Democrats (the political arm of Hollywood) will only continue to lose elections and scratch their heads as they wonder why.  As the rest of the growing majority of Americans who continue to sit back in their increasingly populous red states, read their bibles, raise their children to know the difference between right and wrong, vote against those who promote this tripe, and watch the liberals reap what they have sown, we have to ensure that Hollywood continues to crank out this kind of entertainment so that our message continues to get out loud and clear.

By the final episode, I was extremely moved and more hopeful than sad--I had spent six hours watching these characters and so felt very invested in their stories--wanting at least another six hours with them.  Nichols, his cast and the monumental Kushner have made a work of difficult beauty--the scope of this film as impressive as any grand novel, as any other grand movie (Lawrence of Arabia?  Schindler's List? both with the same power as Angels to draw one into an era of spiritual despair without scaring off most of their viewers) or perhaps even a grand life.

2004093,4,B0001I2BUI,"Undoubtedly one of the best TV mini-series of the last 20 years, Angels in America is a powerful, moving and thoughtful meditation on love, AIDS, loss, power, politics, identity and numerous other themes.  However, it is not the flawless masterpiece that other reviewers claim it to be.  First, the good stuff:

Without an exception, the ensemble cast, many in multiple roles, is superb.  The two central characters, Prior and Louis, are believable, rounded and flawed, and convincingly gay without resorting to campery or histrionics.  Mary Louise Parker is a revelation, damaged and bruised, yet strong and self-aware.  Little needs to be said about Al Pacino other than usual: shouty, but effective.  Emma Thompson almost slips into parody at some points, and her American accent is less than perfect, but she is reigned in by Mike Nichols, and gives a warm performance as Prior's nurse.  Special mention must be made of Meryl Streep and Jeffrey Wright, however.  Streep is magnificent in all her roles, exuding warmth, humour and infinite compassion, while Wright is especially impressive in a funny, queeny, angry yet marvellously understated role as Belize, Prior's best friend.  Thomas Newman's score is effective and frequently beautiful, while Nichols' direction, as expected, is masterful, wringing great performances from his actors, and conjuring up some beautiful images as well as moments of ferocious intensity.  Kushner's script is thoughtful and provocative, and a wonderful piece of theatrical writing.

This last point, however, is one of the series' major flaws.  The dialogue remains too theatrical to convince on a TV screen.  As an ultimately realistic medium, such poetic, beautifully nuanced lines often come across as melodramatic, flowery or, worse, just plain silly.  In the more fantastical elements of the show, that's just fine, but when it's in an argument between two lovers, it is distancing and self-defeating.  The arch theatricality of the screenplay is what, ultimately gives Angels four stars instead of five.  The constant analysis and deconstruction of events creates longeurs and moments of frustration, particularly around the two-thirds mark.  The show could have been more judiciously edited to propel the story forward faster.

Having said that, the final episode is triumphant, with a fantastically succinct, surprising and moving wrapping up of the themes and stories in the show, with a change of tone that is both startling and effective.  The occasional moments of tedium are worth sitting through for the masterful final hour, which succeeeds in clarifying and enlarging the point of the whole six hours.  Ultimately, a highly satisfying, engaging powerful and provocative show.  Highly recommended.",1102723200,13,2751,5.423529411764706

If you like to think about the world, and especially the people, around you, this movie is absolute philosophical gold.

It is very graphic, but if it weren't, the issues looked at would not have their full impact. The story portrays real, truthful life, and so it is scary. We all know that. That said, you really have to have a very mature take on the scary side of life to appreciate this story--the only reason this movie is ever getting below four stars is because the people who watched it got freaked out.

2004096,5,B0001I2BUI,"The first scene in the amazing HBO film that may win you over is one of fantasy and illusion. Sick Prior, after taking some of his drugs, slips into a hallucination or a dream, and meets up with another drug induced character, Harper. Together, they commiserate about their sad, pathetic lives and how they see into each other. The acting, fantastic, the drama, superb, its reality in its unreality is brilliant. Long anticipated, long awaited, the landmark play of the 90's, Angels in America finally comes to DVD with astounding results.

Tony Kushner's play, produced in the early to mid 90's, is both a damning indictment on the lack of response to the early AIDS crisis, to a celebration of those who survive and continue to live with the disease. It's a brilliant work that is not easily understood, but upon several viewings, and even readings of the play, allows the layers and filters of this incredible drama to infuse itself into your own psyche, and by merely watching it, you are changed. Angels quite possibly is the quintessential drama ever produced.

Through a handful of characters, the themes of despair, continuance, and

redemption is explored. Mormon Joe Pitt struggles with his sexuality, while married to knowing-yet-unknowing wife Harper, who struggles with her drug addiction. Prior Walter, struggling with AIDS, must deal with his prophetic status, while dealing with less than supportive boyfriend Louis. Prior's story is countered by arch-conservative real life attorney Roy Cohn, who fails to acknowledge his own struggle with AIDS. Additional characters include Belize, a former drag queen and current nurse, and Joe's mother Hannah, herself coming out of her Mormon upbringing who probably deals with reality the best of them all.

Given the brilliant script, the acting soars above anything seen recently on television. Screen stars Al Pacino and Meryl Streep powerhouse their characters, making them incredibly real. Justin Kirk as Prior and Ben Shenkman as Louis both prove their acting chops by being the center of the film and carry it extremely well. The first scene where they discuss Prior's illness sets the tone for the entire film. However, two performances absolutely stunned me. Mary Louise Parker as Harper, makes her character, which reads as a crazy lunatic, more heartbreakingly honest and internal pain. And Jeffrey Wright as Belize harnesses the anger and resentment of the entire gay community with his beautiful performance. He perhaps is the most underappreciated American actor today, and I don't know why we don't see him in many more things.

Angels isn't for everyone. Those easily offended by religious plays, homosexuality, or AIDS would best steer clear. However, if you want a movie that will reduce you to tears many times, where you love the script and the acting, I highly suggest Angels in America.

2004097,3,B0001I2BUI,"I saw and loved the play but the movie version leaves much to be desired. It is far superior to most TV movies, obviously, but the material does not translate well from stage to screen. Many moments that were either touching, funny or impacting in the stage version were flat on the TV screen. The acting is excellent, not surprisingly with an A list cast like this. Much of the dialogue to me seemed absurbly pretentious, more like poetry than any type of believable dialogue. If I wanted to read poetry I would...but I don't watch movies for poetry.

Also, the 'message' is unbelievably preachy and heavy-handed. Some of the scenes simply went on too long and towards the end I was actually fast forwarding to get to a point where the plot actually advanced. It should have been about 3-4 hours instead of 6.

I was reluctant to rent this as I thought it would be a predictable, mindless and vulgar soap opera for urban gay people with little to interest anyone else. It is anything but. This is a story told with an epic sweep and deals intelligently - and sometimes brilliantly - with everything from politics, American immigrants, Roy Cohn, Mormonism, theology, angels, and family to the Reagan years and AIDS. I am anything but a liberal - I am a Bush conservative - but a great piece of writing is a great piece of writing no matter what the point of view. And ""Angels"" is a great script. This is a six hour movie but director Mike Nichols has it zipping along at such a fast clip that there isn't a dull moment. Don't let your distaste for (or boredom with) movies with gay sub-plots keep you from this one; you'll be missing out on a great film. The entrance of the Angel at the end of part one is unforgettable and one of the most spectacular pieces of film in the last decade. Pacino gives a great, intense performance as Roy Cohn that doesn't have him chewing up the scenery and becoming a parody of himself. Mary Louise Parker does a great job as Harper, the emotionally ill Mormon wife who comes across as Marie Osmond on ecstasy and LSD.

And his counterparts in this film are also engrossingly well performed people. Gosh, I just can't say enough abotu this film. My one pet peeve is the little speech at the end, given by four of the principle characters. I thought the style was out of step with the rest of this movie and it didn't settle right with me.

To see the stage play, you had to attend 2 evenings worth of theater -- Yes, it was a mini-series even when it played live, and each evening was over 3 hours!  We're talking over $100.00 for just one person to see this production once!  The critics may say what they will as to whether or not this recorded production is as good or better than the original.  But the bottom line is, if you love theater and great production values, this was an epic effort, well worth a few bucks.",1101427200,4,922,4.458333333333333
2004101,3,B0001I2BUI,"Very loyal re-working of the brilliant Broadway show, but not much imagination. Mike Nichols does an exceptionally capable job bringing the play to the screen, but it rarely lifts off and feels like a real ""movie.""

2004104,5,B0001I2BUI,"Sometimes, we take for granted the immesurable privilege to see films that portray gay men in a light other than weepy, limp-wristed, lovestruck kids who ultimately have a raunchy lovescene that makes the rest of the free world cringe.  It might be over-complicated, that's true, but isn't that a good thing once in a while?  I'm not knocking other less salient films, but this one just grabs your balls, straight or gay, and pulls down on them hard enough to make you actually...*gasp*... think!  It is important to note that no matter what age or decade we live in, issues regarding homosexuality essentially remain the same.  And this film is a brilliant rendition of the play i had the honor of seeing onstage.  While it may also be true that some parts of the film have fallen short of the expectations some audiences set.

The DVD's are an added bonus to a cinephile like myself, it gives me and others like me the chance to take a bit of the magic home.  It is undeniably a grand vision of a world even some gay men already chose to forget.  After all, the greatest thing about this film is just to remind us about things we have almost forgotten.  It has accomplished its purpose just because it's there.",1100131200,12,1212,4.548387096774194
2004105,4,B0001I2BUI,"Nichols' film version of Kushner's play is faithful to the ethereal effervescence of the original. The performances by ALL of the actors are pitch-perfect (Mary-Louise Parker is particularly forceful, as is the brilliant Jeffrey Wright.) I am not using the word ""wonderful"" aimlessly: the film is literally full of wonder. My only gripe (aside from the fact that not one of the main actors is gay) is that Nichols decided to cut the line ""Very Steven Spielberg"" at the end of Millenium Approaches. That may seem like a ridiculously mundane gripe, but that one line encapsulates the entire power and point of Kushner's play (according, too, to Kushner)! The play is a reponse to the overly schmaltzy barrage of AIDS dramas in the 1980s. Society, it seemed, accepted gay men only as subjects of death and sappy sentiment. In the play-text, Kushner takes the most potentially sentimental moment in the play (Prior is at rock-bottom! The Angel crashes through the roof with sublime, spiritual, stunning force!)...and undercuts it with Prior's campy response, exposing the fakery and artificiality of straight society's view of gay men. Alas, this production decides to forsake powerful cultural critique for unabashed sentiment, playing it safe in more ways than one, in what is an otherwise perfect rendition.",1099958400,6,1306,5.194312796208531

Anywho, the first half is so compelling I couldn't stop of watching it.  I sat through all 6 hours in one sitting, and I didn't start watching until 7pm. The second half looses something.  It gets confusing and very artsy fartsy.  It distracts from the wonderful acting and message in this film.  Still, I have no regrets sitting through all six hours.  I hadn't done that since ""The Stand.""  This is exceptional filmmaking.  A rare film that treats gay characters as people not stereotypes.  There are some very humorous scenes mixed in with the grit and flights of fancy.  There are moments that are so real and hit home with me.  Simply excellent.",1099353600,3,924,4.617283950617284
2004107,5,B0001I2BUI,"Two hundred years from now, when the AIDS epidemic will be ancient history as both a vaccine has been developed and a cure found, when people want to know what the AIDS plague years of the 1980's were like, they can acquaint themselves with this marvelous work by Tony Kushner. This HBO production, directed by one of America's great directors Mike Nichols, (screenplay by the playwright) deserved every award it received. The acting is phenomenal. Meryl Streep literally becomes Ethel Rosenberg. The Roy Cohn deathbed scene where she recites the Kaddish is spellbinding. She is also perfect as Hannah, (such an Old Testament name) the Mormon mother. Of course she would wear sensible shoes and carry one of those awful rain scarves in her purse for rainy days. Al Pacino plays the vile Roy Cohn with everything he has. (Cohn was such a reprehensible human being that someone created a panel for him for the AIDS quilt that points out his awfulness, calling him a bigot as I recall.) Emma Thompson (we've all known someone just like her) is better as the nurse with a tattoo, too much eye makeup and a polyester nurse's uniform than as an angel. In the stage production, the angel's appearance is magical. You literally gasp when the angel, held up only by wires, first descends, appearing to Prior. That magic is difficult to translate to the screen and some of that wonderment is lost, as we get bogged down in the angel and heavenly scenes-- it's good to know however, that gay men go to San Francisco when they die-- but the film may ultimately belong to Jeffrey Wright who plays the effeminate African American nurse Belize.

Mr. Kushner is so ambitious, tackling homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, fundamentalist religion, closeted homosexuals, gay Republicans, the indifference of the Reagan administration to the first cases of AIDS because they were in the gay population and more-- and then friendship, the courage of the gay community, death and dying, love and ultimately hope. There are so many levels of meaning here and different plots that the playwright artfully brings together.

There is much humor here (the memorial service for the ""glitter queen"", for example, and more sadness. Parts of this play with make you weep. Some scenes are almost too painful to watch. Many of the lines approach poetry. ANGELS IN AMERICA is simply the best thing ever written about AIDS. How do you compare, say, a short story or a novel or a three act play for that matter with a six-hour epic? It is impossible to describe just how wonderful this production is.",1098921600,22,2563,4.862700228832952
2004108,3,B0001I2BUI,"I really enjoy Angels in America.  As a play, it is wonderful, and does a lot of things that can be translated really well to the stage.  However, I don't feel that the HBO version really did the show justice.  First of all, Kushner suggests that the audience see the magic- the strings holding up the fantastic things that happen.  Secondly, I don't believe Justin Kirk did a very good job as Prior.  He lost some of the WASP-y wit that is so necessary in the character.  Yes, he is dying of AIDS, but he doesn't want pity.  I did think there were some great performances, mind you, but I would rather see it on stage where it was meant to be seen.",1098921600,4,649,4.227642276422764

I could definitely feel the theatrical roots as I was watching the movie -- the long intensive monologues especially reminded me of sitting in a theatre and I found myself wondering how different the movie is from the play.

I found the angel scenes and the visual effects unbelievable, however, you just have to go with it and eventually, you fall into the story and accept the premises. I almost stopped watching after the first dvd because it was just a downward spiral emotionally, with respect to the subject contect, and also the pacing was getting slow. However, I kept going and it was worth it in the end.

2004110,4,B0001I2BUI,"Whatever else you say about it this IS a remarkable film.  The performances, much of the writing, the music, the direction and the special effects are all top notch.

Be warned that this is a ""deep"" movie --very heavy drama-- not your typical Friday night fun fare.  Watch this when you can handle some intensity and thought.

I did feel that many of the scenes went on way too long, and could have benefitted from some judicious script editing.  One would have hoped that famed director Nichols would have had the clout to pare down even such highly revered material as this, but apparently not.

That said, it is a moving and thought provoking experience.  While there are a few glimpses of non-sexual nudity, there is nothing truly ""explicit"".

Watch this one when you are ready for some heavy drama, and willing to be patient with scenes that go on a bit too long.  In spite of these factors, it is ultimately a rich and moving work, with superb performances and interesting themes, and is well worth seeing.

2004113,5,B0001I2BUI,"The shocking intolerance on display below, in some of the negative reviews of this production, is one of the main subjects of this series, and only helps to show how direly we need productions like this one. It ought to be broadcast on prime time national TV. Much of Angels is about how 'keeping up appearances' can destroy people's lives; its core subject is the fundamentally inhuman nature of conservatism. The Angels are ""cosmic reactionaries"", as one character has it; one of them (Emma Thompson) descends on the main protagonist, Prior Walter (Justin Kirk), to tell him that people have to stop moving. Movement shakes up Heaven, which relies on stasis, eternal sameness. Walter is promoted to a ""prophet"" of this message, a mission he grapples with but ultimately refuses. This central story interweaves with his conflicted relationship with Louis (Ben Shenkman), his politically engaged liberal boyfriend who runs out on him because he can't deal with the ravages of Prior's illness, AIDS. Louis in turn upsets the marriage of valium-addicted Harper (Marie Louise Parker) and closeted homosexual attorney Joe (Patrick Wilson). Joe breaks away from his stifling routines, much to the dismay of his Mormon mother Hannah (Meryl Streep), who comes over from Salt Lake City to intervene, and ends up finding typical (or even ""stereotypical"") homosexuals not quite as bad as she thought. Harper meanwhile escapes into her own Antarctic dream world. Another person not pleased is Joe's employer, none other than Roy Cohn (Al Pacino), a viciously homophobic homosexual, who tells his doctor that he hasn't got AIDS, but liver cancer. This of course doesn't save him from a lonely AIDS-death, haunted by the specter of Ethel Rosenberg (Meryl Streep), whom he put on the electric chair in the fifties through corrupt manipulation of the justice system. All these manifold plots are connected by the character of Belize (Jeffrey Wright), an ""ex ex drag queen"" who is Cohn's nurse, Prior's ex lover and Louis's friend, and clearly the morally superior force in the play.

Angels is incredibly rich and complex; the writing is terrific. The brilliant surface of Angels, that abounds in wit, tragedy, humanity, political debate, campiness, even occasional sentimentality, conceals a multi-layered message of universal appeal. The acting in this production fully realizes the text in all its dimensions. (Pacino's brilliant performance attains an extra edge due to his uncanny physical resemblance to Cohn - just take a look at Mapplethorpe's terrifically horrific portrait of that man, and than watch Pacino: it's chilling.)

The blatant factual falsehoods contained in some of the negative reviews demand contradiction. Some people would have you believe this is an X-rated film, but the references to ""explicit sex scenes"" in several reviews are utterly exaggerated. There are exactly two scenes in the whole series that, with a considerable stretch of the imagination, could be called explicit. Neither of them involve nudity, both are of tragic rather than erotic portent, and one (the much maligned Central Park encounter) is mainly ludicrously absurd and comical. The supposedly ""explicit"" sexual activity in these scenes in total accounts for less than a minute of the whole six hours of the series.

Several actors play double or triple roles, not to show off their versatility or to let the make-up department have a ball or whatever, but simply because the original play dictates it that way (I will not go into the symbolic depths hiding behind this device). Many viewers of this series seem completely unaware that this is a faithful televization of a tremendously successful two-part stage play. That people hungry for superficial entertainment run into their video rental store and take home anything with an appealing box cover without having a clue what it is, ending up shocked or disappointed, seems to me to be their own fault, not that of the film at hand.

It is very simple: if your are of conservative or religious bent, or a homophobic, you will quite probably hate AinA. So don't watch it - problem solved. But you will deprive yourself of simply the greatest thing ever made for American television.",1098403200,56,4220,5.156204379562044
2004124,5,B0001I2BUI,"This epic 2003 HBO mini-series, adapted from the award-winning Broadway play by Tony Kushner and directed by Mike Nichols, is moving, compassionate and extremely weird.  I didn't expect to like it.  I don't like stories that include angels, dream sequences and long philosophical speeches.  And the topic of AIDS in the 1980s was sure to be, I thought, depressing.  I therefore only rented the first of the two-disk series and expected to only watch the first of the three episodes it contained.  Three hours later, it was well past midnight and I was sorry I didn't have the second disk in my possession because I would have stayed up all night to watch it. It took another two days for me to get the second disk.  And now that I've watched the whole thing, I'm certainly impressed.

First of all there is the star power.  All Pacino is cast as the true-life lawyer Roy Cohn who really did die of AIDS in the eighties.  He's one of those people we all love to hate, and hate him we do, right down to his painful death scene in which he dies angry and unrepentant. This is perhaps his finest role and he is absolutely fantastic.

Then there is Meryl Streep.  She actually plays three different roles.  I recognized her in two of them - as the Mormon mother of a gay son who has left his wife, and as the historical Ethel Rosenberg who Roy Cohn sent to her death in the 1950s.  But it wasn't until the credits rolled until I realized she also was cast as the bearded rabbi who officiated at a funeral in the opening scene.  Emma Thompson played multiple roles too.  She's the understanding nurse as well as a homeless woman.  But in her largest part, she's an angel.  And, rest assured, she is no ordinary angel.  She's angry and gutsy and passionate and wild.  And even though I still don't like angel scenes and wished they would hurry up and end, I must admit that her acting was superb.

Justin Kirk plays the young gay man with AIDS. His performance is spectacular as we watch him go through all the phases of contemplating his death.  His lover, Ben Shenkman, is weak.  And so he runs away, deserting his companion and trying to find solace by starting a relationship with Patrick Wilson, a married Mormon attorney whose ethics have been compromised by Roy Cohn.  Mary-Louise Parker is cast has Patrick Wilson's slightly insane wife.  Jeffrey Wright is an angel who helps her out and he's also cast as a gay nurse who takes care of Roy Cohn. His performance is fantastic and I must say he's an actor to take note of.

There are six episodes in all.  And all are not created equal.  There are slow parts that bored me.  And, true to my own tastes, I didn't like the scenes with the angels.  But, taken as a whole, I was caught up in the artistry of the writer, director and actors.  I also loved theme even though it was disturbing.  It put me right back in the 1980s when the world was just discovering the awful specter of the AIDS crisis. It was set in a New York that I know and understand, including the politics of the time.  It all seems like a long time ago.  But I'm glad its essence has been captured on the screen.  This is not a perfect series and it certainly isn't for everyone.  But I certainly found it worthwhile and intriguing and definitely recommend it.",1098316800,17,3277,4.423076923076923
2004125,1,B0001I2BUI,"I have no problem with the overall content and theme of the movie. Yes its important for all persons to be treated equally, AIDS is an unmitigated tragedy, but really this movie could have gone about plying its message in a more affective way.

And yes I did watch it to the end, but the foul language and intended graphicness while not overtly explicit was extremely uncomfortable to watch especially because the scences were too long and in some cases unnecessary to my thinking (the anal sex in the park, being one scene I could have done without).

The obsence language and vulgar inuendos become tiring and repulsive and repetitive. I wanted to give the whole cast a dictionary to learn some new words. I kept thinking, they've got to stop with the ""f"" word soon, but it seems most of the cast was extremely verbally challenged and this word seemed to be the only word they knew how to use for feeling angry, loving, impatient, etc. That word is considered vulgar slang people! It also means to victimize, cheat, betray or take advantage of.  As I women I take offense to this word because it connotes sexual violence or victimization.

I agree with one reviewer -- this is not a movie you'd want to watch with your kids.  I don't understand why it is not rated?This is not a spiritual movie as the title leads you to believe  but a look at what happens when people don't respect life, others, or themselves.  Its a view of some very selfish people despite the movie's attempt to make political and racial statements about the 80's.

In essence this movie is disgusting. It shows nothing of the true anguish and love that gay people can feel toward each other. If I didn't have some very close gay friends, I might contend from watching Angels in AMerica that this is how life is for all gay people and to be honest, I wouldn't want to know them.

Human beings suffer, no matter whether they are gay or not.  Disease and tragedy afflict us all.  Listen up America, we as a caring and compassionate society are going down the toilet and unless we begin to care about each other instead of selfishly going about our daily lives and believing only God talks to us and not our neighbor, we will make Hell on Earth a reality for our children. Does this movie motivate one to change from being selfish to caring?  I don't think so.  SO what was the moral value in the movie?  I've read other reviewers who gave this movie high ratings, but nothing they've said changed my mind.

In closing, for Pete's sake rate this movie and warn people in advance that is it dark, obscene, and heartless.  The ""humor"" is very thin.  And Prior's ghostly ancestors were annoying.",1098316800,34,2662,4.535564853556485
2004126,4,B0001I2BUI,"I'm definitely a far post second war country homosexual audience to tug in my words on the space of this page alongside many vocal native viewers here, the set era is mid-80's America when I was just a kid who hardly knows what U.S.A. stands for, the casting generation is 30 years before what I can understand a word from SERPICO or SILKWOOD, and that I am none of any religion to speak of religious revelations or visions.

Thanks to increasing medias for selected HBO programmes these days, but I'm glad to find myself among a few instant crowds to recognise this must-see miniseries production. It's intense for the first time I can feel man's struggle with ""afterlife"" strongly depicted before television since I have read AFTERLIFE by Paul Monnette many years ago. The emotions are vibrantly interpreted and deeply revealed, and so real that I can relate beyond my non-religious mentality with the character of Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) for subconsciously praying for an angel (Emma Thompson) to save his battled world.

Only a little annoying for me is the racistic, impulsive Louis Ironson but only because Ben Shenkman is playing the subduedly offensive character so well. Both Patrick Wilson [THE ALAMO, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 2004] and Mary Louise Parker [THE BEST THIEF IN THE WORLD, SAVED!], who play the sexless Pitt couple, had offered the series certain degree of nudity of disputable subjects yet not in a slight light-hearted method.

ANGELS IN AMERICA is a profound result to efforts of faithfully devoted believers from home box behind-the-scenes in making one's purest sacred hopes and prayers come true on screen. A must-see gem.",1098230400,2,1654,4.9855072463768115
2004127,5,B0001I2BUI,"""Angels in America"" is, quite simply, an incredible, incredible viewing experience and is well worth six hours of your time. Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Mary Louise Parker, and a bevy of others all turn in outstanding performances. Al Pacino is especially good and brings a lot of verve and ultra right-wing nastiness and awfulness to the real life figure of Ray Cohn. The direction and writing are also excellent, with the dialogue verging on Shakespearan at some points--it's a joy to listen to. The film touches on a multitude of subjects, including what it meant to be gay in 1980s Reagan America. It cemented my view that having a more liberal, left wing perspective somehow makes one more human, because right wing politics oftentimes has no room for tolerance and inclusiveness. Indeed, that seemed the main message of the film--we are all human and in this together no matter what our age, race, or sexual preference. I highly recommend this film.",1098057600,14,967,4.938650306748467
2004128,1,B0001I2BUI,"So many here have given this film 5 stars, it seems people consider this a contemporary classic.  I beg to differ.  Mike Nichols has never been one of my favorite directors.  Am I the only one who thinks The Graduate has not held up well?  Well, as for Angels in America, it possesses all the problems I hate about contemporary American films that take on heavy subject matter.  One thing is fairly explicit love scenes that go on way too long.  I am getting to the point where intimate scenes between characters, whether between two men, two women or a man and a woman - it doesn't matter - if they go on longer than a couple of minutes (unless the plot is continuing), I grow uncomfortable and then annoyed.  I feel like I'm intruding on an intimate moment that should be for the characters, not us.  Filmmakers - wake up!  There are ways to create love scenes without just showing characters all over each other.  Once that starts - cut away!  We get the point!  And all that singing and dancing.  Excuse me but it was boring.  The plot has to continue even when they sing.  Perhaps it was the writer's attempt to create something like The Singing Detective, but it's not clever and falls flat.  It didn't work all that well in The Singing Detective either (and I'm talking about the BBC version, not the remake).  And the Emma Thompson angel stuff just showed me how well she can overact.  Emma, your Shakespearean acting style is wearing thin, please give it a rest.  All those visual effects.  For what?  Added nothing to the film but a little bit of visual interest.  And also, what was the cutsey point of having Meryl Streep and some of the other cast members playing different roles, covered in makeup?  To give Streep an opportunity to show what a great actor she is?  We don't need that.  Give some other actors a chance.  As for the acting in general in this film, it was the best thing about it, but it just proves good acting can't save a long-winded, sanctimonious, overdone plot.  People have complained about the language, which doesn't bother me, but there was so much of it it began to feel like the writers were falling back on it like a crutch.  The score by Thomas Newman, however, was one of the few understated things in this production.  But the film needed to be cut down.  At least by two hours, probably more.  The whole thing was in slow motion.  Perhaps one day we'll get a film that deals intelligently and creatively with the problem of Aids and gay people in America, but this is not it.  Oh, and if I see one more silly reference to the Wizard of Oz in an American film, I'm going to puke.",1097971200,34,2624,4.422594142259414
2004129,1,B0001I2BUI,"Angels in America is a stirring, moving drama about the pain, suffering, and hopelessness of gay life in America.  The film speaks powerfully, poignantly and disturbingly to the indomitable human spirit. This is a tribute to the marvelous acting which is the only saving grace of this confused, conflicted tale.

The characters are as tortured and twisted as the plot which finally, spins out of control as an irritated ""angel"" squawks ""I am a bird of prey"" as she struggles to escape the grasp of a would-be Jacob who is dying of aids. The scene then shifts to ""heaven"" which more closely resembles hell - stark, barren, populated with characters more demonic than angelic.

The story does end but not until bizarre events are twisted together: the Rosenberg trial and McCarthyism, anti-capitalism, lesbianism, and Mormonism. Strange bedfellows indeed.

I wish the author had left God and heaven out this philosophical mess of a story. It is rootless, meaningless, and full of despair. Very unlike God, who loves the mortal afflicted people that He created. He alone offers healing for the hurting and hope to the hopeless.

This is an awful film - dressed up with wonderful actors who add some dignity to the sordid mess.",1097971200,36,1223,4.946341463414634
2004130,3,B0001I2BUI,"The cast is truly phenomenal led by veteran living legends Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, and a scene-stealing Al Pacino.  The rest of the cast is solid with particularly memorable performances from Mary Louise Parker and Jeffrey Wright.  The direction is inspired, to say the least, with superb set designs and some fantastic coaxing with the actors to bring out some genuine performances.  And the script is based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play.  The writing is, in itself, remarkable...and incredibly depressing.  The story takes place in the mid-80s with the emergence of the AIDS epidemic which is often referred to as another Black Death brought upon humanity.  There are characters who struggle with the disease, others who struggle with their faith in religion and politics...and each other.  The overall effect of this 6-part series is not uplifting ever, with all the characters being very human but sometimes coming across a little too sanctimonious and/or emotional.  By the time part 4 ended I really didn't care about any of the plot resolutions to come, nor about any of the characters involved.  Part 5 and 6 seemed interminable by comparison to the first 4 parts.  There is also a lot of homosexuality in the story, some of which is very explicit, which does lend a strange kind of taboo freshness to the plotting, but by the end of the show I was shrugging my shoulders in confusion.  There are no revelations...only great suffering sparked by the occasional glimmer of hope that is soon snuffed out by a high minded gust of wind.  The last scene of the series is a soliloquy for Mary Louise Parker's character which suggests while we need hope it probably isn't very likely we will find it any time soon.  I cannot recommend this series for the simple fact that I don't want to relive another 6 hours of creative depression, regardless of how well made or how well acted the show is.  Final note: there are no special features on either disc, which is surprising given the amount of talent and effort went into making this series.",1097712000,8,2049,4.817142857142857
2004131,5,B0001I2BUI,"I long ago came to the conclusion that few of the people who run media, outside of art house and film festival environments, were interested in producing something for the small screen that is moving and contains ideas in the same way that great theatre does. I am glad to have stumbled across this powerful, moving, funny, beautiful exception. The fact that (spoiler a few words away, beware!) they would put a drama on the air where it turns out that god has vanished from the universe thus forcing the angels, finite, limited creatures like us,  to try to carry on as best they can -- much as we poor humans must -- is stunning.

AIDS victims whom I have known often feel abandoned by god or even cursed by him. AIA actually takes suffering seriously in a society where most media feeds us happy talk or happy-ending stories or sentimental junk religion 24/7. This film takes the problem of pain and its meaning seriously in the same way that the greatest plays of the ancient Greeks or Shakespeare did.",1097625600,14,1006,4.583333333333333
2004132,5,B0001I2BUI,"2003's Angels In America, directed by Mike Nichols, aired on HBO and won the most Emmy Awards for best series. The 6 hour series (yes it is very long and comes in two DVD's) stars Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Marie Louise Parker, Emma Thompson, among others. The lines between reality and fantasy are blurred as the main theme seems to be that angels in Heaven are suffering an enormous crisis- God has abandoned the Universe out of his disappointment with mankind. Set in the 80's, during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the AIDS outbreak, the series follows the lives of gay couple Prior and Louis and straight couple Joe and Harper. When Prior is diagnosed with AIDS, Louis abandons him and hooks up with Joe, who has been a closeted gay all the while he was married to Harper. Joe is by far the most interesting character. Raised a Mormon, a Republican lawyer who works for Roy Cohn, notorious for secret evil doings and political machinations. Prior, though, is the focus of the movie. He is visited by an angel (Emma Thompson) who declares him a Prophet and who takes him to heaven where he is gives specific instructions on how to make the world right again with or without God. I never understand the need for the religious symbolism and business with angels, but it seems to work beautifully, a great symbolic metaphor and contrast for the real and scary world down below in New York City and in San Francisco. Be warned however, this was an HBO series and contains a ton of foul language, nudity and sex- mostly homosexual sex. The theatrical play was much better, despite the advantage of using computer graphics, the New York City location including the ""angel"" statue in the Park and other visual elements. This is strictly an adult movie with adult content and at no times must this be viewed by children or younger viewers. Kudos to Meryl Streep for her sensational performance as three people- the Rabbi as the movie opens, Joe's Mormon mother who is nevertheless strong, opinionated, courageous and forgiving and as the famous executed Communist lady who looks like a 30's, 40's Eleanor Roosevelt type of woman. Al Pacino, too, deserves credit and applause as Roy Cohn. This movie lives up to its hype.",1097625600,10,2219,4.721649484536083
2004133,1,B0001I2BUI,"Wow.. since when has sensationalism with no end meaning overwhelmed US entertainment? Yes, this movie deals with a heavy subject, and yes it tries, but it also severely lacks punch where it would have been vital. Magnolia, for example, is far more powerful.",1097193600,26,257,5.0
2004134,5,B0001I2BUI,"Set in 1980s New York and subtitled ""A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,"" the six-hour ANGELS IN AMERICA concerns a group of largely gay men who find themselves caught up in series of disasters that range from love to religion and from politics to philosophy--and most specifically caught between the rising tide of AIDS and a generally unsympathetic society.

In the midst of this, AIDS patient Prior Walter begins to have a series of visions, which may be fever dreams, medicine-induced hallucinations... or, most unnerving of all, real. His long dead ancestors rise to speak to him, the floor cracks open to reveal a burning book--and at the conclusion of the play's first half a beautiful woman with majestic wings crashes through his roof. She is the Angel of America. He is, she tells him, a prophet, and she has come to bring him a message for mankind.

Intertwined with Prior's other-earthly experiences are oddly parallel lives. Joe and Harper Pitt are a deeply dysfunctional couple doubting their faith in the Mormon Church, Joe a closeted homosexual, Harper a valium-addicted and mildly psychotic woman given to visions as strange as those of Prior Walter's. And as further counterpoint historical figure Roy Cohn (1927-1986), among the most sinister figures of 20th Century America, finds himself taunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg as he drifts toward his own AIDS-induced death. The characters swirl in and out of each other's lives and dreams, playing to stereotypes and yet defying them, arguing politics and philosophy and love and death--and it is fascinating stuff.

Although the play stunned 1990s audiences, most considered it utterly unfilmable due to both length and content.  But this HBO-produced, Mike Nichols-directed version not only captures the power of the original, in some ways it improves upon it.  Playwright Tony Kushner has adapted his work to the screen, rearranging certain problematic scenes and bits of dialogue to better effect, and certainly no one could argue with the cast, which is absolutely stunning in a series of multiple roles.

With a mad swirl of irony, intense drama, outrageous humor, and unexpected twists and turns, ANGELS IN AMERICA is almost sure to hold your attention--particularly if you recall the Ronald Reagan years well enough to recognize the truly bitter allegory the film offers on what many consider his largely absentee second term.  Truly a must have, multi-layered, bearing repeated viewings, beautifully directed, performed, and filmed.

2004140,5,B0001I2BUI,"Tony Kushner's film adaptation of his prize winning play, 'Angels in America,' is at once a haunting yet compelling tale about the lives of people stricken with AIDS during the Reagan era.  Under Mike Nichols' direction, the film manages to capture the mangled emotions of not only those who are affected by the devastating disease but also of their loved ones, their friends and the medical professionals who attend to them.

While the movie centers mainly around Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman) and portrays their conflicted relationship once Walter finds out that he has AIDS, the film manages to capture superlative performances from Al Pacino as Roy Cohn and Meryl Streep in four different roles.  Emma Thompson as the Angel and as Walter's nurse also gives a memorable performance as do Patrick Wilson as the ""Gay Mormon Republican"" Joe Pitt, Mary Louise Parker as Pitt's wife, Harper, and Jeffrey Wright, who reprises his stage role once again as the fierce Belize.

The film also attempts to offer an interesting mix of political and philosophical issues that are examined and re-examined throughout the movie.  Presented during Reagan's conservative Republican administration, the turmoil in the lives of homosexuals, not to mention those stricken with AIDS, struggling to find an acceptance is expertly shown.  The religious and philosophical bonds that the Mormon Joe Pitt possesses turn him into a painful and convoluted soul, who himself is incapable of accepting of who he really is.

Al Pacino as Roy Cohn probably sets himself apart from the crowd (once again) in his portrayal of the slimy, conniving divorce lawyer who is used to getting what he wants even in the face of death.  Modeled on a true life character, Pacino's constant yelling seems a tool to reassure himself that his connections and the dirt that he has on people will get him through anything even the deadly disease that he is fighting.  As the movie goes on, Cohn's slow realization that he will slowly perish to a painful death has been captured brilliantly on film.  In the end he is a sad sight: debilitated, defeated and dead.

Where the movie falls short is in its length but the slow movement at times seems to drive in the movie's beautiful message. The closing scene sums it all up and I urge you all to see it and understand just what I mean!!",1096502400,12,2366,4.89

The performances are just astonishingly brilliant, with most of the cast playing multiple roles, all of them superbly.

I had been interested in it sense, but had never gotten the opportunity to see on stage or read the script, so when I found out that HBO was going to be releasing this miniseries on DVD I was in very high hopes that it would be everything that I had hoped for!

I watched the entire film (all 6 hours) and was absoluetly blown away, the story is probably one of the best ever written, the characters are amazing, and the actors (especially Justin Kirk ""Prior"" and Patrick Wilson ""Joe"")  are nothing short of spectacular.  Nearly every actor in this film deserves an award of some sort, whether it be an Emmy or whatever else.

This movie now holds the number one spot on my list of favorites.  And I don't think it will be replaced anytime soon.  This film truly does touch the deepest regions of your heart and soul.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  It will make you angry and it will make you hurt.  It will make you overjoyed and it will mend your wounds.  This movie truly is remarkable and I highly recommend it to everybody that is interested and even to those who aren't.

If you are contemplating purchasing this movie, do it, I guarantee you will not regret it.  I payed $33.00 for Angels In America and it is probably the best decision I have ever made when it comes to buying movies.

I hope this review helps in some way and I hope you agree with me once you've seen it!  It is an instant classic!",1096329600,15,1520,4.28421052631579

2004160,5,B0001I2BUI,"Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"" is without doubt one of the best plays ever written. There is almost nothing in contemporary literature that compares to Kushner's ambitious ""fantasia on national themes,"" blending gay men dying of AIDS, unhappy housewives, Mormons, Jews, Angels, Roy Cohn and Ethel Rosenberg into one exhilarating meditation on religion and politics in America. The film version of ""Angels in America"" is a long time in the making, and comes to us directed by Mike Nichols, written by Kushner, and a stellar cast that includes Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Jeffrey Wright, Mary-Louise Parker, Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, and Patrick Wilson. At six hours, it is a complex, emotionally wrenching and thought-provoking piece of work that shows indelibly the true greatness that television is capable of.

""Angels in America"" takes place in New York City in 1985, a time when people and cultures are coming together and relationships are being torn apart. Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) is dying of AIDS and his longtime lover Louis (Ben Shenkman) leaves him. Closeted lawyer Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson) works for the ferocious and manipulative Roy Cohn (Al Pacino), a homosexual with AIDS who never admits his orientation. Joe's wife Harper (Mary-Louise Parker) is addicted to Valium and is profoundly unhappy, and when she disappears Joe's stalwart mother Hannah (Meryl Streep) moves to New York to pick up the pieces. As Prior is hospitalized, he is cared for by Belize (Jeffrey Wright) an ex-drag queen, and begins to have terrifying visions of an Angel, played by Emma Thompson.

""Millennium Approaches"" and ""Perestroika"" form the two parts of this epic film about sex, politics, religion, and forgiveness. The first half sets centers around relationships falling apart, only to be reborn during the second half. The acting is amazing all around. Al Pacino gives his best performance in years as the evil but still human Roy Cohn. Meryl Streep amazes in her three major roles as Hannah Pitt, the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg, and an aged Rabbi, and Jeffrey Wright is stunning as he recreates his stage role of Belize. Patrick Wilson and Mary-Louise Parker are also very solid, and Emma Thompson is glorious as the Angel. Justin Kirk and Ben Shenkman are uneven, but mostly very good. The screenplay is perfect, and Mike Nichols' direction is superbly imaginative.

""Angels in America"" will likely be viewed and discussed for decades. It is occaisionally too studied, as if the creators couldn't stop thinking that they were adapting a Great Work of Art, but when this movie lets go of that and soars, it is breathtaking to behold. Although it does have its flaws, the good points ultimately outnumber the bad, and its sheer ambition and epic scope make it well worth seeing.

Winner of 11 Emmys including: Best Miniseries, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor (Pacino), Best Actress (Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Wright), and Best Supporting Actress (Parker).",1096243200,6,2987,5.152577319587629
2004161,5,B0001I2BUI,"Just rented the movie this weekend and was glad that I found the movie.  Yes people who have reviewed it this is about the gay lifestyle but it takes it about 2 steps further and it tells the story of three gay people.  One about Roy Cohn the famous attourney who committed two people to death and then he and his gay lover are documented in this movie and he ends up having Aids and ends up in the hospital dying of this very death and in the end the friend of the lawyer that Roy has working for comes in and says a Jewish Prayer over the dead body of Roy.  Second there is a story of a man named Prior Walter and this man also is a gay person but ends up getting AIDS also and ends up living for six years after he gets the disease and during the first few months of this disease he sees this angel and ends up in the end going up to heaven to beg of forgiveness to the higher authority and comes back down to earth and preaches the word to everyone and takes the bible the angel gives to him.  The third story in this miniseries is about a man named Joe and his wife and his wife ends up taking some Valium everyday of her life and ends up hallucinating everyday and going into dreams and also in the end of the first disk she ends up in her makeshift dream of Antartica which in my estimation is very weird and very cooky but in the end Joe is a closet lesbian and comes out to his wife and her mother played by Meryl Streep and he ends up dating Prior Walters boyfriend but in the end they break up and Priors boyfriend comes back to him.  At the end of the miniseries we see Prior, his boyfriend, Joe's mother, and Roy Cohn's nurse in the middle of Manhatten in front of a statue and Prior is giving us a monologue of the rest of his life six years after getting diagnosed with Aids.  To me this was a riviting miniseries and a very eye opening one for me because I should not be judging people by who they go out with for what reasons everyone has their choice in who they go out with and we can be thankful for that.  That is why this miniseries was nominated for 21 emmy awards and won half of them 11 including Best Actress in a Miniseries and Best Supporting Actress in a Miniseries plus the Best Miniseries.  So all in all very well done by Tony Kushner and Mike Nichols for adapting it to the small screen.",1096243200,3,2320,4.050218340611353
2004162,5,B0001I2BUI,"I just watched this on DVD, and all I can say is ""Bravo."" Amazing that something this superb actually appeared on TV first. The acting was incredible and the story imaginiative and compelling. I am a straight white woman (jsut for the record, as I noticed some reviewers think that only gay men will be interested in this)and having worked in healthcare during the 80s, this is right on target. And for those who think this is uncalled for Republican bashing, well, in 1985, 25,000 people had already died of AIDS and the Reagan administration was trying to pretend that it didn't exist. In fact, it was over five years after the first published reports of AIDS appeared, that Reagan actually made a public statement about it. By the time the govt really acted, AIDS had spread into far and wide, way beyond the gay community. But because in the early days, it was restricted to gay men and IV drug users, the conservatives Republicans in power looked at AIDS as a ""moral"" issue. So now, is there any reason to wonder why there was so much Republican bashing in this movie? You have to look at things in their historical context.

This is one of the best productions I have ever seen. When I think of all the people that died, because of our government's inaction, it does make me ill. You can catch glimpses of that in this movie, as to how AZT, the only AIDS drug available at the time, could only be gotten by the privileged few.",1096070400,43,1432,4.486590038314176

The Republicans are all evil (except for the one good Republican, who eventually sees the light) and the gay characters are all witty and clever and charming.

Stereotypes are boring, regardless of which side is being stereotyped. And oversimplifications don't promote useful dialogue about important issues. Frankly, this isn't a movie; it's a lecture.

It reassured me that it was still possible to have magic and quality in the performing arts, not just the drivel and garbage that passes for ""quality entertainment"" in  our society.

I had great trepidations when it was announced that HBO Films was finally going to adapt this project. Even though the assembled cast was top notch, to be sure, it was a daunting task, to say the very least, and yet, in its own mysterious ways, this TV adaptation , though it goes through a a metamorphosis esential to the medium, it peels ways layers of meaning amd subtlety which enhance even more the mastery of Tony Kushner's creation.

2004166,4,B0001I2BUI,"Let's cut to the chase here.  ""Angels"" is a beautifully shot, gloriously acted fictional work.  Amazingly, it was the lesser known actors that gave the most brilliant performances.  Much more so than even Pacino and Streep.  The roles were played with realism and vibrance.  Truly exceptional work.  The acting plus the cinematography was enough to cause me to sit down and watch this  miniseries even though it was not what I anticipated.  Even the beginning credits are lovely as well as the music.

""Angels"" is well written for what it is.  A closer look however, causes one to think that perhaps it is the people that are suffering with AIDS that are the angels.  Or are the angels the people that try to help those who are stricken?  Is the angel the nurse or is the nurse the angel?  (Those who have seen it understand that last question)

Although this film is strikingly well done, it does give those who  have no knowledge of such things, a mistaken idea of God and heaven.  God is on holiday here and angels are trying to cope the best they can.  While one can appreciate the more ""real"" aspects of the film, the surreal images might be considered to be God bashing or Christian bashing as it were.  Those who know scripture would find such as was written in this story, laughable.  And indeed I did laugh at the attempts to describe what some would call the ""spiritual"" aspects of Angels in America.

The dynamics of friendship, loyality, kindness, self hatred and caring for one another all come into play here and are woven together well.  Meryl Streep in her role of the Mormon took on a  sort of dumbness that I fear is all to common an opinion of those who try to live their lives according to their faith.

Many deeper issues lie herein.  Morality, faith, heaven & hell, responsibility,  respect, where illnes comes from, why do we suffer, are angles real, is God real, does He hear our prayers, doesn't He care, where is He?  Obviously the answers to these and other queries you may have will not be answered in the watching of ""Angles"".  Still, it's a fine piece of work.

I would recommend it to only those who are are not easily swayed.  The subject matter may offend some folks with certain sensibilities.  It can be graphic at times.  Even so, Angels in America is one of the most brilliant works from Mike Nichols to date.",1095897600,11,2346,4.54066985645933

I understand HBO was in a rush to release the film, but I don't think it would have killed them to allow us to gain a little more insight.

This is a controversial miniseries. As one reviewer pointed out, they had no idea what the film was about (only seeing the cover with an angelic figure on it). If you'd never heard of this film (for some reason) and only saw the cover of it at your local video store, the assumption may be that this is strictly a ""spiritual"" film about people and angels. Be warned, it isn't.

So what is it about?

That can be tough to put into one, short review but I'll give it a shot. So here goes.

God is on a permanent hiatus/vacation and left the angels in charge of heaven. And they're not happy about it. They're working their...well...wings off trying to keep up with God's job (the scene toward the end of the film with angels at desks flowing back away from the camera is pretty impressive). Since God isn't around to answer human prayers, humanity must rely on each other ...with a little help from the angels. If there's any doubt that God is absent from both the angels' lives and ours, all you have to witness is the outbreak of AIDS/HIV, the silence of the Reagan Administration about it, and the horribly corrupt legal system that tries to be more letter correct than ethical.

The story plays out against a triad of lives, basically. First you've got a young man who's in love with a Jew. They've been living together and must now face the worst of the worst: AIDS. Their acting is spot-on, comical at times, and very touching. Secondly you have an assistant district attorney (played EXCELLENTLY by Al Pacino) who's a scumbag with incredible clout (he can ring up the White House easily). But he's just been delivered a serious blow: he has AIDS, too. But he refuses to change his character. He's a yelling, screaming, evil, and twisted man who refuses to believe he's dying until the final moments. Thirdly, a newly married Mormon couple are encountering problems. The wife is having emotional and psychotic breaks, while her husband contemplates his own sexuality.

Brought in amongst this group of people is an angel (played well by Emma Thompson ...who actually plays a triple role in the miniseries, being a nurse and homeless woman as well). One of the gay men begins to see her in visions when he's running fevers, or whenever he gets an erection (actually that's how he knows when she's close by). She tells him that he's The Prophet and that his life will have meaning. Her loving touch and frightful powers are an awesome spectacle on the screen.

Played out against these characters (angelical and no) is the Reagan Administrations crushing absence of any mention of the AIDS epidemic. There are some great revelations that many of the characters bring across to the viewer during the series (mainly by Al Pacino as he lay dying in a hospital bed and gets visits from a rather famous person that he put on death row for being a communist during the McCarthy investigations).

This series is excellently acted, perfectly filmed, and brings all the characters together toward the end. Toward the end ....

And here's why only three stars were given by me. The end. The film makers did something unforgivable in my opinion. Instead of letting the viewer come away from the film with the understanding that AIDS is terrible and that God may not have all the answers for us (that we might have to turn to ourselves in times like these), the film makers set up a mini-talk documentary by the actors at the end of the movie, telling us about their political motivations and the HIV/AIDS problem; rather than having us come to those conclusions on our own based on the film's merits. WHY DID THEY DO THIS! I don't have the answer.

I still recommend this miniseries. It's well acted and brings out an important message. It's just unfortunate that the makers of the film didn't trust us (the viewers) enough to think we'd ""get it"" and not mash our faces in the ""message"" at the end. If it weren't for that, this would've been a five star review. Easily.",1095811200,16,3967,4.630156472261735
2004190,5,B0001I2BUI,"I was fortunate to travel to New York City in November 1994.  I saw a number of things on Broadway since I knew I was not likely to return anytime soon (as I haven't).  One of the things I managed to see was ""Angels in America.""  I knew it had won a Tony Award in 1993 as well as a Pulitzer Prize and I knew that it was Tony Kushner's lengthy play in two parts, his ""Gay Fantasia"" about the AIDS epidemic.

I saw Part I ""Millenium Approaches"" at a Saturday matinee and went for an early dinner afterward, returning to the theatre to see Part II ""Perestroika"" that night.  It was an amazing day.  The dialog was riveting.  I laughed uproariously at the witty lines and found tears in my eyes at other times.  I'd never seen a play with as much to say and with such a delightful premise.  A lot of what happened was pure fantasy and it made a wonderful nonliteral vehicle through which ideas could be presented and discussed and profound questions asked.

Nearly 10 years later, the DVD version of HBO's adapation reached me and just a few days ago, I spent yet another Saturday watching both parts of ""Angels in America.""

I cannot praise the adaptation enough.  Cinematic values were topnotch.  The acting was superb.  And 95% of the original play remained intact, thanks to the fact that Tony Kushner adapted the screenplay himself from his original live play.

Most of it has worn well with time, though many of the ideas presented, though still of great importance, are no longer as fresh as they once were.  Too bad it took 11 years to bring the play to the screen, but infinitely better late than never.

I gather a number of people were bored or offended in some way by this play.  So I would caution potential viewers NOT to bother with ""Angels in America"" if:

1. You think a fantasy can't present ideas and questions.

2. If you don't have a sense of humor in the face of the AIDS epidemic.

3. If you need to hold gay men and lesbian women as bad and wrong in order to validate your own negative experience of self.

4. If you're so far to the right politically that a liberal viewpoint -- or any viewpoint markedly different from your own -- strikes you as unpatriotic and subversive.

5. If you're very conservative in religious interpretation and you need to take everything literally -- specifically, if you think that a fantasy involving angels who are sexually stimulating and the idea of an absent God is anything other than a literary device.

6. If words bore you and listening to dialog puts you to sleep.

Really, there are other DVD's to rent or purchase and if this is going to bother you, well, life is just too short to be miserable and blame it on others.

As to the subject matter and those unfortunate people who think this movie is HBO's version of ""Touched by an Angel"" or something, well, the original play made headlines, won a Tony award on TV (with a scene re-enacted on the awards show), won awards and was much discussed.  A movie title will seldom tell you much about the plot of a film, so you might want to look something up if you missed the publicity the first time around.

Three cheers for HBO, for Tony Kushner, and for a superb ensemble of actors.  The number of Emmys won by this production says it all.  Excellent, amazing, superb, surprising, extraordinary, worthwhile.  Not for everyone, I suspect, but three cheers to HBO for doing something not designed for the uncaring, the easily bored or offended.",1095811200,18,3452,4.483974358974359
2004191,5,B0001I2BUI,"I did not have high hopes when HBO announced that they were adapting Tony Kushner's play, Angels In America, into a cable movie.  After watching the 6 hour long movie, I was stunned by the brilliance of Mike Nichols' directorial adaptation to capture a Broadway play and put it on to the big screen.  Teaming up with Nichols, Kushner had to re-write several scenes in order to make the play work into the movie.  But both men did a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of a stage play and putting it in movie format so that the viewing audience understood the meaning of Kushner's words, the emotions that stem from the words said, and the vision of what the actors were trying to portray.  A movie and play like Angels in America is made to make an audience think about life, stimulate the mind, and to understand what it is like to be in society, for some, a society that is not often seen but only read about through obituaries.  This movie should be in everyone's DVD collection, if not for the story itself, but consider the way the movie was produced.  Not many directors can capture a play's essence and put it on a television or movie venue.  Nichols is able to capture all of it, the essence, the words, the guttural reactions, and the time period. This is one movie you cannot miss.",1095811200,10,1295,4.461864406779661
2004192,5,B0001I2BUI,"It turns out that while my wife and I watched ""Angels in America"" on DVD, it was winning a huge pile of Emmy awards. Frankly, it doesn't take watching the award show to see why it got so much notice this year, and I'd rather watch the series itself than the Emmy Award show any day of the week.

""Angels in America"" is by turns funny, touching, whimsical, serious, and most of all surprising. I wasn't too surprised to learn that it was adapted from a stage play, as it has the feeling of a play at several key points in the story, but it's not distracting or annoying, and even adds to the effect in some ways.

""Angels in America"" is essentially the story of several people of different backgrounds in New York City in 1986. This is the time of Ronald Reagan, the advent of AIDS, and a time of great uncertainty for many people in America. The characters of ""Angels"" are several gay men, a Mormon husband and wife, a mother, an angel, a ghost or two, and perhaps most surprisingly, McCarthy-era lawyer Roy Cohn. How these people's lives touch one another, how they weave together to form the tapestry of America, is the real theme of ""Angels in America.""

The performances in ""Angels"" are all memorable, especially when you keep in mind that several of the actors play multiple roles (again, as often happens in a stage performance). See if you can spot Meryl Streep's first appearance in the film when you watch ""Angels"" for the first time! While all the actors were excellent, the performances that really stood out for me were Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, Emma Thompson (always a favorite of mine), and Al Pacino, who plays Roy Cohn in perhaps the best performance of his career. It takes top-notch performances to convey this sort of material convincingly, and these actors deliver all that and more.

The direction of ""Angels"" was refreshing as well, at times lighthearted and at times deadly serious. Mike Nichols gets the point across in each scene with a steady hand, and despite some pretty tricky scenes never falters. The film is brutally honest in what it depicts when honesty is needed, but also whimsical at times when trying to be too serious would come off as outright cheese. I found the scenes with Emma Thompson as the messenger angel especially effective in this regard, as just when it seems like it's getting too over-the-top serious something surprisingly light happens. It's a combination used throughout the film, and always to good effect.

The score for ""Angels in America"" deserves mention as well, especially as it was the score that originally brought the series to my attention. I'm a pretty stalwart devotee of Thomas Newman's work these days, and couldn't be more pleased with his music for ""Angels."" It's the perfect accompaniment for the series itself, and like the series the music rides the fine line between heartbreak and hope quite well. The music is lovely to listen to on its own as well, but more importantly, I can't really imagine any other composer's work who would match the emotions and themes of the series as well.

Make no mistake, ""Angels in America"" is a complex work, much moreso than my simple summary of it would seem. No matter where you come from or what your background is, you are likely to find something in this series which challenges something you believe in -- not in an in your face sort of way, but in a subtle, nuanced way. This is not a presentation which is trying to offend you or change your mind, but it is certainly trying to make you think.

Check your pre-conceived notions of religion, politics, sexuality, and even sanity at the door. In this vision of America, you'll find that they simply don't apply. That revelation is perhaps the most inspiring thing about ""Angels in America"" -- it is about what America means, in the best sense.",1095724800,23,3813,4.673621460506706
2004193,5,B0001I2BUI,"I have long held that the major strength of dramatic television programming is the able to tell extended narratives. I am thinking not only of the mini-series and such epic classics as ""Shogun"" and ""Lonesome Dove,"" but of traditional dramatic television series that create lengthy story arcs, such as ""Wiseguy"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" I shudder to think of ""Angels in America"" reduced to a theatrical film half as long and you know full well that network television would have censored the script beyond recognition. Only HBO could have done this and they deserve all the plaudits they are getting after having swept every major category it was nominated for, including all four acting honors as well as Best Miniseries, Directing, and Writing.

""Angels in America"" was originally two full-length plays by Tony Kushner, ""Part I: Millennium Approaches,"" which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, ""Part II: Perestroika,"" which won the Tony Award. Taken together the plays look at ""the state of the nation"" in 1985 when the AIDS epidemic was exploding during the Reagan years. Two of the main characters in the drama have AIDS. Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) is a reasonable young man who has to wonder if he has gone insane as he is visited by the ghosts of his ancestors with the same name and an angel (Emma Thompson). The other is Roy Cohn (Al Pacino), the infamous lawyer from the McCarthy Hearings and the Rosenberg trial, a hateful powerbroker who insists his doctor (James Cromwell) treat him for ""liver cancer"" because only powerless people get AIDS.

These two characters are intertwined with the lives of others who come into play in various and often surprising combinations. Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson) is a lawyer at Cohn's firm, a Mormon who closes his eyes when he makes love to his wife, Harper (Mary-Louise Parker), because he is imagining she is a man. Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman) is unable to cope with what is happening to Prior, his lover, and while he walks away he is so consumed by guilt he engages in high-risk behavior. Belize (Jeffrey Wright) is a caring and compassionate African-American gay nurse while Hannah Pitt (Meryl Streep), Joe's mother, arrives from Utah when Joe confesses in a middle of the night phone call that he has left his wife and is a homosexual.

Kushner is able to cover the spectrum of reactions to AIDS, both by those who have the disease and those around them. There is also the clear undercurrent that the nation's reaction to the epidemic is both political and prejudiced. However, with a title like ""Angels in America"" you know that there will be a strong religious element as well, from the rabbi who opens the play talking about how nothing ever really melts in the American ""melting pot"" to the revelations that God has abandoned his creation (it happened at the time of the San Francisco earthquake) and that Prior has been chosen to act as a prophet and help the world return to the ""good old days."" However, Prior refuses to act as the angels want and has a few choice suggestions for them instead.

The true angels in ""Angels in America,"" of course, do not appear until the final scene of this 352-minute drama at the fountain in Central Park with the statue of the Bethesda angel. Those characters represent all faiths, races, genders, sexual orientations, and generations, as well as caregivers and patients, and reinforce the idea that heaven is what we make on earth. For those who need points made directly and explicitly, the play provides a benediction, delivered directly into the camera in close-up in language so plain and firm as to command their assent.

""Angels in America"" is both beautiful and profane. The dialogue is witty and searing, poetic and powerful. The collision of characters is compelling, as are the performances. Several of the performers, most notably Streep, have multiple roles, which adds an additional level of resonance to the tale being told. You would think that after almost two decades this play would be dated, but while there is clearly a fierce anger against the Reagan America of that time, ultimately ""Angels in America"" is about compassion and understanding, even towards that which we hate. The great irony here may well be that the fear and hatred of the homosexual community against those who fear and hate them is just as strong. The difference is that the notion of ""community"" is decidedly more vital to gays and lesbians.

Director Mike Nichols has shepherded Kushner's brilliant translation of his stage drama to the small screen and confirmed once again how good television can be (even when it is not TV but HBO). I really think that the only thing to compare this to in television history is ""Roots,"" and not simply because it is another example of how television can raise the consciousness of the nation. I say this because of the way this production has been chaining out, with more and more people checking out this monumental work, just as the audience for ""Roots"" built each night it was on. All those Emmy awards can only help spread the word.",1095638400,24,5073,4.831990794016111
2004194,5,B0001I2BUI,"This film took over 10 years to bring to the screen. If the subject seems dated to some, the crisis is not over. This could be a film about any disease, and any Country. This could easily
be Africa, and a huge section of their population.

6 hours, based on a play,I thought I'd be bored. We watched the entire program in one sitting! We actually fumbled to get the second DVD onto the player so we could continue, it was that intense.

The story is often funny and always touching , the acting superb. The moods and the lighting suggest the peril surrounding the characters.

There are so many reasons that this won a record 11 Emmies,
Meryl Streep is just one. As Mrs. Pitt , we see how much trouble she has visiting her son, who snubs her. Then, we see how loving and kind she is to Prior. Streep plays 4 roles here, and is awesome. Pacino is despicable as Roy Cohn , and his
performance is riveting. The scene with Cohn and his Doctor is unforgettable. A master manipulator

To me, this is a story of pain that some can't see, and pain that some can't handle. The angels are the ones who see the pain, deal with it,and find it hard to understand why the others walk away from their loved ones' pain. Abandonment and
salvation are reoccuring themes, reality and fantasy coexist
in most of the characters, or is it ""under influence? ""

The music is excellent ( the theme is breathtaking ), and fits well with the subject. It would be hard not to be touched by this winner.",1095638400,13,1474,4.326086956521739
2004195,5,B0001I2BUI,"Set in the 1980s, on the brink of this ""syndrome"", we follow the story of several people as they intertwine, interweave, and co-exist in a world frightened of the new millennium.  It explores the a series of themes like individuality, friendship, love, fear, death, life, evil, and most importantly heaven.  God has left us, abandoned us, as this film would say, as Republicans beat down the door in Washington and create rules set forth by old white men with a passion for reliving the past. The world, especially America, has become a very cold place.  As the millennium approaches, Prior Walton must choose whether he wants to become the next prophet for the angels.  He must decide, alone and scared, if he is ready for the challenges that await him.  He must choose for all of us.

If you watch this film, no matter if you believe in what you see or agree, you will react.  That is the ultimate pleasure of this film.  It causes a reaction in its viewers.  Pulitzer Prize winning Tony Kushner develops this reaction thanks to an intelligent script and story about our world.  This was more than just a movie, it was more a cautionary tale of our lives.  It explores so many possibilities (all most too many to name) between religion, culture, race, economy, politics, and power.  An aspect of this film that pulled at my heart and mind were the words that came from our actors mouths.  This is not your normal grunt and sputter dialogue, this was imaginative, bold, and extremely provocative.

This jumbled mess of a review is my simple attempt to trivialize this massive film.  Angels in America is one of those films that should be enjoyed with a glass of wine, open friends, and an open mind.  This film insights ideas and challenges thought.  That is why I loved the play so much, I have a passion for reading literature that breaks the cultural norm.  That shows us, the American public, what we are afraid to look at in that dark alleyway.  Angels in America, the play, did just that.  Thankfully, director Mike Nichols does not sway from that vision.  He beautifully gives us each detailed image as if it were the last.  Not only is the cinematography, should I say, exceptional (it is a very small word for the truth), he has quite possibly the best actors working for him.  Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, the AMAZING Jeffery Wright, the OSCAR WORTHY (if a film) Justin Kirk, and the powerful Emma Thompson, all giving more than 110% for this film.  It is films like this one is the reason why I love cinema.  When you have a film that goes beyond the mindset of the average American, you have already won the battle.  You film will stand out and speak to a new audience about the truths that surround our lives.

In case you haven't noticed, I loved this movie.  Love is such a small word.  I adored this film.  This is one of those films that you will remember forever and want to watch again (all six hours of it) over and over.  The story is so tight that it pulls you in from the opening scene and doesn't sugar coat anything.  This is reality that just happens to be picked up by a camera.  This is a story about America, our America, and the relationships that surround us.  This film is like going into a history museum and seeing modern day images of our pilgrims.  Angels in America is the story of a new breed of settlers, crossing a new uncharted America, looking for a land that is not corrupt, evil, and sinister.  They are looking for their own utopia, much like our fathers before us.

Groundbreaking.  This deserves every award it receives.

2004196,5,B0001I2BUI,"From some of the reviews below I understand I will qualify as a pervert if I say something positive about this production. I'll just take my chances, in the belief that the true perverts are those who cheer the legalizing of automatic guns and the denial of basic civil rights to whole segments of society, but are deeply offended at the sight of a naked human body. Not, for that matter, that there are more than 30 seconds of full nudity in the whole 6 hours of this miniseries. Let me just state flat-out that Angels in America is by far the best American made TV production I've ever seen, and no doubt one of the most meaningful, wise and healthy things to have come out of that country for a very long time! Why this show wasn't aired in Europe is beyond me.

The original play was premiered in The Netherlands by RO Theater in Rotterdam in 1995, at which occasion I saw it and was completely blown away by it. I was very curious to see whether the intensity achieved in a small theatre through a very spare, minimalist production - very much ""actor-driven"", as Kushner suggests in his instructions - would hold up amidst the trappings of a big scale multimillion dollar TV-production. I remember how back then the closing scene of  Perestroika, where the characters address the audience directly, was almost unbearably intimate and had me stifling my tears. To my surprise the effect achieved in the filmed version is, if anything, even stronger. The whole experience of viewing this was so compelling that I would probably have watched it in its entirety in one go had it not been way beyond my bedtime...

If you like simple escapist happy endings, are allergic to surrealism, have trouble confronting the ravages of serious illness, are deeply religious, are a homophobic or a hardcore republican, beware. If any of these apply then you REALLY need to watch this, but you won't like it! AinA certainly is no innocent family entertainment, as one of my fellow reviewers found out after being fooled by the romantic box cover. This is an angel that deals out orgasms and whose approach is signalled by erections! Tony Kushner's writing is up-front, uncompromising and irreverent in dealing with matters of emotion, sex, politics, religion and the general ugliness of the world. It is also deliberately stylized in places, but realism is never a first concern in a story where the dead mingle with the living, visions and hallucinations abound and angels descend from heaven. It's a tribute to Kushner's genius that no matter how surreal the context, the people in this story are nevertheless profoundly touching. They may be thwarted characters, but they aren't flat ones! I was glad to find that the whole production adheres very closely to the original text of the plays. It is a heady mix of razor-sharp (and at times hilarious) sarcasm, anguished tragedy, gay clich&eacute;, biblical allegory and political pamphlet. The outward appearance, a story centring on AIDS victims in  '80s New York, may seem dated, but the underlying message is universal. AinA addresses some fundamental questions about the nature of the USA that have rarely been more to-the-point than they are today (the quip about the word ""free"" in the national anthem being deliberately set to such a high note that nobody can reach it struck me as particularly topical...).

To see these highly charged lines delivered by such a cast as this one is of course pure delight. Al Pacino trumps his own satanic performance in ""Devil's advocate"" as a thoroughly corrupt, yet strangely intriguing Roy Cohn. It's good to see Emma Thompson out of period costume and in angelic garb for a change, and to my non-american ears the twang she gives Nurse Emily sounds quite convincing; the power of the words is even such that they succeed in turning Meryl Streep into somebody else than Meryl Streep. But though these big names are the ones touted on the box, it are Justin Kirk, Ben Schenkman, Patrick Wilson and Mary-Louise Parker who act the true core of the story, and in no way does the power and passion of their performances yield to that of the ""stars"".

Angels in America offers you a lot to think about and has a powerful potential to move. Some of its characters may seem hard to identify with, but soon enough you'll find that you have more in common with them than you thought (and like, possibly). On top of all that this series is beautifully produced. Rather than going all out on special effects, the supernatural events retain a theatrical feel. ""It's OK if the wires show"", Kushner says in his staging instructions; of course, there are no wires showing here, but scenes in Antarctica (stage set) or Heaven (Hadrian's villa in Tivoli, Italy, with the Golden Gate bridge blended into the background) have been realized through artistic creativity rather than the nowadays ubiquitous and bloodless computer tricks. It only adds to the sincerity of it all. Thomas Newman's music is, as always, a treat in itself. Please don't miss this.",1095638400,16,5019,4.809965237543453
2004197,5,B0001I2BUI,"An excellent adaptation of the award-winning play about the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, when certain people believed, and many still do, that everybody who gets AIDS deserves it.

There are great performances, but not unexpectedly, from Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson.  Standout performances also by lesser-known actors like Jeffrey Wright and Justin Kirk, among others, who appeared in the original stage production.

Heavy going at times, but ultimately moving.

Some viewers have left disparaging, even offensive reviews.  It makes me wonder why they selected this DVD at all, as the subject matter was quite clearly stated in the Amazon synopsis.  Why watch a story about gay people and AIDS if these are subjects with which you are clearly uncomfortable?  One person in particular, with nose obviously out of joint, asked, ""Who the hell do these people think they are?"" I wonder the same thing about him.  Did somebody force him to watch this DVD?

2004218,5,B0001I2BUI,"Had it been released theatrically, I think 'Angels In America' would be best movie of the year.  Ironically, no studio would ever release this theatrically. Too long. Too smart. Nothing that would make it's money back...even w/the talented folks in it.

Religion, sexuality, disease, environment are all touched on - and not so lightly. Tony Kushner's play tells a great interwoven story - but I see some reviewers here must have forgotten (or been uninformed of) the '80s and the culture that was predominant during the Reagan era.

The cast pulls it off flawlessly...almost.  Streep is does a wonderful job as Mother Pitt, but especially as Ethel Rosenberg (the make-up to look like Rosenberg is dead-on). For me, Al Pacino was, well, Al Pacino.  I know Roy Cohn is supposed to be over the top, but for much of his performance, Pacino plays it the way he's played many of his characters of the last decade.

As for other actors (who are not supporting, but as much of leads characters as the ones played by Streep & Pacino) they are wonderful.  You cannot truly separate the men into whom is better than the next.  Ben Shenkman, Patrick Wilson, Justin Kirk and Jeffrey Wright do outstanding jobs.  (Though personally, I think Wilson does an A+ job as the sexually conflicted Republican.)

I cannot say enough good things about the job Mary-Louise Parker does. I found her simply amazing. In a much more limited roles(s),Emma Thompson does a good job as the angel and a homeless woman....and an ok job as a nurse.

Even tertiary characters do an excellent job - including Simon Callow as one of Prior Walter's ancestors.

The story, though maybe exaggerated at points, delves into deep emotional waters.  The fear of disease, being sick, dying and the emotions that go with it are real....and at times unsettling (at least for me).  The loss of love on almost every character angle is just as hard.  There are no neat tied-up bows at the end...not really.

Yes, the DVD has no extras - which is disappointing.  But a bigger disappointment would have been if the play had been adapted in a half-ass manner.  I can live w/out the extras.",1095465600,14,2136,4.742547425474255

Some of these reviews seem to imply that the men in these stories deserve what they got, that is a symptom of narrow-mindedness, intolerance or just sheer ignorance.  And it's this exact attitude that perpetuates society's overall dilemma; when forced to confront an issue considered ""controversial"", instead of being thought provoking, the will goes unappreciated because many are still too blind to see.  Even so, I highly recommend the movie, all six hours.  Yes, it's painful, sad and occasionally disjointed, but it is also an honest telling of events within the context of the time and place where the story takes hold.

It is affirmation, it is condemnation.  Crushingly brutal, yet joyously uplifting.  It is at once real, surreal, hyper-real, unreal.  It is a piece unto itself, and a pop-culture microcosm.  It demands that you bring something, anything, to it, then reflects that something back at you, for good or ill.

What is it?  What is ""Angels in America""?  It is, in a word, ART.",1095206400,14,699,4.420634920634921
2004225,4,B0001I2BUI,"Angels in America was a big undertaking for HBO. They took the wonderful play by Tony Kushner and got a great cast and director. Among the cast is Meryl Streep as a rabbi/Ethel Rosenburg and numerous characters. She, Al Pacino, James Cromwell, and Sir Michael Gambon add to the wonderful cast. Cast aside, this film is funny and thought-provoking. Let's face it, today that's a rarity.

Like any work, it has its highs and lows. Among the highs are wonderful acting jobs, biting humor, and a good take on the controversial AIDS crisis. The series goes much deeper to cover the 1980s way of life and many other issues. For that, it deserves praise. The lows include excessive language, some outlandish situations, and too much dialogue in some spots. But overall, this is a work that needs watching.

In conclusion, if you want to see a work that is fresh and thoughtful buy this DVD. However, if you are homophobic or don't care about the AIDS crisis, don't buy it. But we should all praise HBO for having the courage to make a film that tackles issues that are all but ignored today. Enjoy.",1095033600,8,1091,4.618556701030927
2004226,1,B0001I2BUI,"Sadly, the best thing I can say about watching this DVD is ""I'm glad I didn't pay for any tickets during the hurricane"".

When one sits down to watch a movie, she shouldn't have to be projectionist, ticket taker, usher, and critic all in one phase of history. Al Pacino can act like there is no tomorrow, but that doesn't make him a writer at the dawn of time. Likewise, Meryl Streep was not a baseball player. To imply (as this DVD does), that some kind of extra-terrestrial uranium force was responsible for the AIDS epidemic is more then irresponsible, it is downright anti-thought-provoking.

On the positive side, the six actors who were at the forefront of this drenching catacomb did give the utmost sincerity in all known dimensions (and I believe there are four dimensions).",1095033600,20,783,4.75

I mean, I'm gay myself, and I couldn't relate to ANY of the characters, they're so far from what I am and what I have experienced...and that's something of a miss, when there are so many gay characters in one play!! If only I could relate any of them to some of my friends, but no...another miss. And WHY do they always have to show gay men 1)in drag (I hate drags!! They bore the c**p out of me!!) and 2) befriend whimpering, screwed-up females??

2004228,5,B0001I2BUI,"I hate to echo previous sentiments, but I do wish this had been a theatrical release instead of a TV movie so that people would experience it on the big screen and the filmmakers could be eligible for Oscars. I saw the play on tour in the early 90s and was disappointed after hearing all of the hype. However, I found this adaptation to be a far superior experience to the Pulitzer Prize winning stage version.

Jeffrey Wright's performance is jaw-dropping. The dialogue is thoughtful and meaty and interesting. The negative reviews here talk about a formless plot, which is not entirely inaccurate. I would argue that this film is a work of art that doesn't need to be held to the strictest notions of plot structure and character development, as the film is ultimately about neither.

For people who do not have HBO and missed this film, I strongly recommend a purchase. It is truly quality filmmaking with artists (including Mike Nichols, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson) at the peak of their careers. Not to be missed. Six stars out of five. Terrific.",1094947200,22,1065,4.720430107526882
2004229,5,B0001I2BUI,"For those who are afraid of taking the dark journey into the soul of the mid-eighties AIDS epidemic, this adventurous film will not allay your fears of experiencing its brutalizing effects and the unrelenting aftermath that holds us hostage to this day. What is surprising about this movie is that it captures not so much the play's dramatic impact (a given with this production's pedigree), but rather the epic sweep, fantastical elements and brittle humor with a heart-pumping gusto rare for any movie. But this is no ordinary movie given that playwright Tony Kushner wrote a groundbreaking two-play masterpiece over a decade ago that serves as a sweeping indictment of Reagan-era homophobia, medical apathy and social ignorance. It certainly doesn't hurt that legendary director Mike Nichols has guided this ambitious drama with an amazing cast that only starts with Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson.

The story primarily follows three characters whose lives intertwine - Prior, a young man dying of AIDS; his ex-boyfriend, Louis; and Joe, Roy Cohn's ambitious protege, a closeted Mormon married to a woman slipping into delusional depression while he starts an affair with Louis. The fictitious characters are counterweighted by a subplot that centers on Cohn, the demagogic McCarthy-era lawyer who willingly convicted the Rosenbergs and whose closeted promiscuity led him to his 1986 death from AIDS. In his heartfelt adaptation, Nichols allows Kushner's poetic soliloquies full reign and films New York City as an epic backdrop to depict an epochal time. With a six-hour running time, the story certainly takes its time winding through several stories to its conciliatory conclusion, but not a single moment seems wasted here. A major part of its pleasure is how unexpected the plot turns are and how seemingly jarring images and scenes gradually make sense within the torrential stream of the storyline.

The acting is uniformly superb but not in a way that one would have expected. The veteran leads are predictably strong, yet they do not dominate the ensemble. As Cohn, Pacino rages like he was onstage in an Italian opera, seducing and poisoning everyone around him as he produces his own kind of virus in embodying the corrupted American Dream. Streep, as ever the acting chameleon, gets to play three characters - a pallor-white ghost of Ethel Rosenberg, a bravura turn as an aged rabbi and most significantly, Joe's repressed Mormon mother who unlike her son, gains greater self-awareness by the movie's end. Thompson gets to play three smaller roles in a stunning fashion equal to Pacino and Streep, most memorably as the angel crashing through Prior's ceiling. I have to admit though that as impressive as Streep and Thompson are, it is rather distracting to see them cast in multiple roles for their obvious versatility, which takes away somewhat from the veracity of the story.

Regardless of the veterans' contributions, it is really the acting by the younger actors that makes this movie transcendant, especially since they have the bulk of the screen time. Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman and especially Patrick Wilson are all excellent as Prior, Louis and Joe, respectively. Kirk avoids mawkishness with fiery intensity. Wilson gets kudos for greatly underplaying his role to haunting effect against the dramatic fireworks spewed on him in scenes with Pacino and Mary-Louise Parker. His sense of lost identity is palpable at the end. Parker movingly plays Joe's wife, Harper, who takes Valium to insulate herself from the world crashing around her. She mixes self-pity and humor seamlessly into a character that alternately rankles and cowers. And as the film's moral center in a blazing performance that cuts to the heart of the messages of intolerance and ignorance, Jeffrey Wright plays Belize, a flashy but truthful confidante to Prior and Louis and acerbic nurse to the dying Cohn. When the ensemble acting is at this high a level for six hours, it is hard to imagine what the effect of a mediocre performance would have had on such a potentially unwieldy project.

There are a lot of grandstanding speeches of self-revelation that may alienate some viewers, especially those who may not be able to appreciate the story within its historical context. But I like to view ""Angels in America"" as grand opera with powerful themes that need to play to the back rows. It is impossible to think of a movie, much less a TV-movie, with a more ambitious emotional scope and a deeper sense of revelation. I only wish the DVD included extras commensurate with the production itself, but alas, that will happen in future commemorative editions, I'm sure. For now, this is an epic to be savored.",1094860800,19,4711,5.090556274256145
2004230,5,B0001I2BUI,"I am writing this after having watched 'Angels in America' on HBO for perhaps the tenth or twelfth time since it was first aired earlier this year.  Every time I watch it I see something new or understand a different aspect of the film than I did the last time.  It is so rich with humor, pathos, deep thought, questioning, rage, understanding and generosity of spirit that it never ceases to take my breath away.  I imagine I will still be watching it--frequently--years from now as a result of having the DVDs available to own.  I would have bought them at any price, but to have them priced SO CHEAPLY by Amazon makes it impossible for me to imagine not owning them.  I have been waiting since I first saw the film on HBO for the DVDs to be released.

I have always been a fan of Al Pacino and of Meryl Streep, but I don't think it's an exageration to say that nothing Pacino has ever done before prepares you for the intensity of his performance as Roy Cohn.  It is beyond superb.  I have to believe that every actor hopes to reach this level of performance one time in their lives, but very few are ever able to do so.  I think it defines acting, as I have never been so moved by an evil character in my life.  As for Meryl Streep, well, I have seen her in other roles which moved me profoundly, and I am never surprised that she astounds us with almost every performance.  But her performances in this film are earth-shattering.  Almost every actor in this film is astonishing.  James Wright is so remarkable I cannot believe he is not better known outside the New York theater.

There is so much compassion in this film.  Compassion for each and every one of the characters as well as for humanity in general, which means of course that Tony Kushner is not only a genius--but the heart and conscience of a generation.  I am so impressed by this man's mind, his heart and his great loving soul that thinking about what kind of person he must be brings tears to my eyes.

The direction of this film gives me a level of respect for Mike Nichols that I never suspected.  I have always enjoyed and admired his films, but this is so far beyond what I expect from him, that I want to go back and see all his other films again to know if I have been missing something, or if he has just surged with age to a place way beyond where he seemed to be.

There are problems both with the play and the production, as others have mentioned.  These include places where things don't 'work' or just seem weaker than other parts.  In a way they are more obvious because of the strength of the rest of the film.  However, it seems worse than petty to dwell on these minor points or moments in a film of such quality.  It's like dwelling on a mosquito bite on the body of a Goddess.

Which brings me to perhaps the most important aspect of this film.  This country is so divided and hostile today that I find a work of art like 'Angels in America' has even more relevance than it did when it was written.  It is exactly Kushner's compassionate view of both the worst of humanity and the best of humanity that distinguishes this work, along with his honest portrayal of flaws in the thinking and the behavior of both sides of the 'Great Divide'.  [Being less compassionate than Kushner, only my most generous heart--and not any part of my mind--manages to include Roy Cohn in the 'human' category--and even then only because of Kushner's portrayal of him--before seeing this film I could think of Roy Cohn only as the devil himself].  This is not to misinterpret his politics and sympathies which are clearly liberal...but he chooses to humanize rather than demonize those with opposing views.  And he has very sympathetic characters point out the flaws in the liberal 'mythology'.  The piece has liberal politics but it is not a liberal tract by any means.

Kushner examines the aspects of his characters and of Americans in general, that unite them in their humanity.  He also illustrates those aspects which demean and divide them--greed, fear, vindictiveness, hypocrisy, arrogance and self-absorption all make their appearance.  Yet rather than demonize the characters, these weaknesses serve to show their shared complexity, their shared humanity.  In his compassion, Kushner forgives even his most evil characters, and is hopeful even in despair.  He portrays the complexity of human nature rather than playing to win his arguments by appealing to ignorance through simplifying the issues in question.

For those reviewers who say they did not understand this film, I find it hard to believe they really watched it.  My husband's favorite movie is ""Dumb and Dumber"" and he watches inane reruns of situation comedies that were moronic the first time around.  Yet he was the one who saw 'Angels in America' first and taped it for me and insisted nightly when I returned from a business trip that I stay up and watch this movie instead of doing what I would normally do on a 'work night' [which is NOT watch TV].  He then recommended it to all of our neighbors and friends and loaned his precious video to people who didn't have HBO.  Usually VERY quiet, I saw him ask each person who returned the film what they thought about it.  Since he is a deeply SECULAR man, I've never seen him proselytize for a movie before.

People say this is a film about AIDs and about homosexuality, and on some level it is that.  But much more it is about love, compassion, tolerance and AMERICA.  It is so much about the miracle of AMERICA in its theory, its myths, and its beautiful and awful reality.  It is also a love song to New York, (a description usually used to refer to Woody Allen movies) but to the spiritual rather than the physical New York.

Lastly, 'Angels in America' is about faith and religion, and how one's faith and/or religious beliefs can enoble or limit the scope of one's life.  It is about the spiritual vs. the religious and the places where these worlds come together, and how they also exist apart.  It is a truly great film.",1094860800,24,6026,4.530989824236817

2004249,5,B0001I2BUI,"A jaw-dropping film adaptation of Tony Kushner's epic, 5-hour play, which was a defining artistic statement documenting the political and social upheaval that AIDS-HIV disease brought to America's gay community and to the wider America around it.  Mixing agitprop and camp with magical realism and utter, heart-rending, pathos, Kushner and director Mike Nichols bring the story to the screen in a big, big way, with all-around amazing performances by a perfectly cast ensemble.  Al Pacino gets to chew up yards of scenery in his portrayal of the sleazy, venal, far-rightwing attorney Roy Cohn (who acted as Joe McCarthy's point man in the infamous 1950s prosecution of ""atom spies"" Julius and Ethel Rosenberg) and for once, all of Pacino's high-decibel yelling pays off with some real dramatic ooompf.
There are a lot of things that you could comment on in this play -- the exploration of Jewish-American assimilation, the powerful reaffirmation of a supposedly marginalized leftist perspective, etc. -- but the most profound insight Kushner has to offer is about who the real redeeming angels will have to be in our nation's coming cultural reconciliation.  The humanity that he is able to impart into the character of the middle-American Mormon, Mother Pitt (played faultlessly by Meryl Streep), is a marvel of modern political drama: and it rings undeniably true.  Pushing past our narrowly defined social and political ""roles,"" and into our shared humanity, is the only road open to folks who want to see America's moral and ethical core liberated from the ideological intrusions of the religious far-right, and the resulting frustrated anger of the disenfranchised middle-liberal-left.  In a strictly us-vs-them world view, Mother Pitt would be derided by those on the we're-here-we're-queer Left... but as many people have learned, particularly amid the devastating upheavals of the HIV crisis, our real emotional lives are (ideally) not ruled by dogma.  Mother Pitt isn't just a caring parent, she's also a kind, pragmatic person, and for her, the most pragmatic choice when confronted with an epidemic, is to simply offer sympathy and solace.  What could be more natural?  Let's hope her example prevails.",1080950400,312,2213,5.3028571428571425
2004250,4,B0001I2BUI,"Let me get this out of the way right now- I am gay, and I am a student of theater. So, I am intimately familiar with Angels in America. It is my favorite contemporary play of all time, bar none. It might be on par with Shakespeare, I don't know. So, when I heard that HBO was doing a version of this, I was, like another reviewer, intrigued and frightened. My fears were assuaged when I found out who would be in it. (Mary Louise Parker and whatnot)
  When I watched this montrously epic play come to life onscreen, I was more than satisfied. The directing was ok, a little heavy on the mystical elements of the play and lacking in the play's abundant humor. However, the performances made up for this. I think my favorite performance of all of them was Mary Louise Parker. The woman should win every acting award available, be it Oscar, Emmy, Tony, or anything else, for this performance. I have always known she was good, but I didn't know she was THIS good. Oh, my, is all I have to say. I go back to it, and watch it again and again. She is absolutely one of the finest actresses of our time, one of the finest. My other favorite performances were Ben Shenkman as Louis, and Jeffrey Wright as Belize. Shenkman really fleshed out the character, made him more interesting than I remember. And Wright took the minor character of Belize and made him one of the more memorable people in the story. You could just look at him and tell he was brimming with emotion.
  Thanks HBO, for doing justice to this monumental piece of theater.
  A note: I was not all that impressed with Justin Kirk. He is a magnificent actor, and I would love to see him onstage, where he is best. But as Prior, he just didn't get it for me. He was fine, really emotional, but lost the humor the character needs. Too heavy on the self pity. Just my two cents worth-",1080432000,22,1838,4.3130434782608695
2004251,5,B0001I2BUI,"Part One: THE MILLENNIUM APPROACHES
Tony Kushner's ANGELS IN AMERICA created a major sensation when it was produced in the mid 1980s in New York and Los Angeles (and subsequently in theaters across the country). Not only is this a magnificently written drama whose seed lies in the agar plate of America in the time of Reagan, AIDS, post-Vietnam trauma, and general angst, it is presented in a long, two part production that demands much of the audience - not only in physical endurance, but in emotional vulnerability. That Kushner succeeded in making his points is evident in the continuing productions of his bipartite play. And now HBO has granted Director Mike Nichols a huge budget, his choice of the finest actors available, and an uncut presentation of this historically important work for television audiences. Yes, the experience is different when the play is transformed to film, but this transformation was with the complete blessing of Kushner so we must accept that this version is on target with Kushner's concepts.
The story is so well known that it need not be summarized, other that it is a series of messages about mortality, moral decline, the exigencies of dealing with AIDS as a paradigm for the possible extinction of the human race, or more poetically - the millennium, and the importance of connection between souls in a time of terror. The cast is superb - yes, different from the stage production with the exception of the brilliant Jeffrey Wright - and Mike Nichols draws performances from such luminaries as Meryl Streep (a rabbi, as mother of the main character, Ethel Rosenberg), Emma Thompson (a street bum, the nurse, and the Angel Messenger), Al Pacino (in an inordinately affecting portrayal of the usually despicable Roy Cohn), Mary Louise Parker in her finest acting performance to date, and Justin Kirk as the lead. All of the ""minor"" roles (such as the uncredited Michael Gambon, Patrick Wilson, etc) are played to perfection, the appearance of delusional characters is splendid in a surreal, theatrical fashion, and the visual effects are compelling.
After this satisfying Part One THE MILLENNIUM APPROACHES it is with great anticipation that we await Part Two PERESTROIKA. The play/film deals with challenging ideas and it is to the audience's credit that the work is being so well accepted. But enough said. The true brilliance is in the poetic writing of Tony Kushner who deserves every kudo and award available for this daring and provocative and wholly poignant masterwork.
Part Two: PERESTROIKA
Part Two of Tony Kushner's brilliant adaptation of his own play ANGELS IN AMERICA is in many ways more compelling than Part One, due in part to the stunning visual effects afforded film vs stage, but also because of the heightened writing level for his characters. The actors continue to create wholly three dimensional characters, each surpassing their own high standards. The lines are delivered in a near
Shakespearean manner - but then the lines are WRITTEN with a near Shakespearean quality! (...)  three hours of an extended tale requires more room than this space allows. But the message is clear: ANGELS IN AMERICA is the most important work to appear on television. Mike Nichols direction, Thomas Newman's musical score (rapturously orchestrated by Thomas Pasatieri), and all the creators of the special effects and cinematography deserve Emmy Awards and more. This is simply brilliant theater and it will be available on DVD soon.",1080345600,13,3481,5.085664335664336
2004252,5,B0001I2BUI,"I'm not joking.
  I'll be frank: I was hyped up for this film.  Even ignoring the incredible play that is actually life changing, it has a stellar cast and incredible behind the scenes crew.  I wanted it to be good; I needed it to be good.  To say that it superceded my expectations is an understatement.
  This play/movie challenges and provokes; entertains and amuses; floods you with grief and compassion.  Those final words (which I won't spoil if you haven't seen it) make my heart sing.  It features career defining work from Streep, Parker, Wilson and Pacino (Streep in particular is stellar in three different roles), and what had better be career exploding roles for Patrick Wilson, Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, and Jeffrey Wright.  These gentlemen are doing work that they'll have a hard time topping.  Wright manages to take Kushner's poetry and transform it into something Whitmanesque, Shakespearean in it's grandeur and heartbreaking imagery.  He does more with a glance than most actors can do with an entire script.  Patrick Wilson makes Joe's pain so real that it's heartwrenching for the audience.  When he utters ""I'm going to hell for doing this"", you can't help but cry out in sympathy.  Kirk is phenomenal as our leading character - he mixes pathos with deep (and broad) humour, and not only provides the biggest laughs (well, Wright too), but it's only because the comedy is rooted in pain.  Shenkman has the most difficult role - he's the author's stand in.  He's also kinda unsympathetic, and his hyperintelligence isn't portrayed as well as it should be (director/writer, not actor), but Shenkman manages to pull of these disparate pieces into a cohesive whole.
  I'm giving it five stars not because it's perfect (indeed, there are a few little flaws), but because anything this good doesn't need to be perfect.  Anything with this much stuff, in terms of ideas, drama, humour, depth and profundity is reall quite something.  The opening credits are gorgeous (seriously breathtaking.  That's how good this movie is).
  Watch it, treasure it, remember it, and whenever someone bashes Hollywood for producing crap, remind them that it can also produce beautiful things.  This is one of them",1078963200,42,2213,4.997260273972603
2004253,5,B0001I2BUI,"Angels in America is truly a wonderful piece of art.  I was so deeply moved by every single episode that I actually had trouble focusing on anything else after I finished watching it.  Mike Nichols manages to combine the finest poetry with the most atrocious actuality.  The acting performances are also exceptional.  I especially enjoyed Justin Kirk's portrayal of Prior Walter.  He acts with such truthfulness and authenticity and truly manages to capture the thoughts of a desperate man who's not able to accept his own destiny.
My thoughts are; if you'll only watch one thing this entire year, watch this.",1078531200,23,609,4.99009900990099
2004254,5,B0001I2BUI,"Many people get stuck on the fact that Angels In America contains many gay themes, and it's sad.  The themes in this film run so far beyond gays and into every vein of American society.  I challenge everyone to view this film or see the play even if you are vehemently anti-gay.  I guarantee it will open your eyes to a picture much much bigger than you can ever imagine.  I don't believe this movie at any time condemns anyone for their beliefs, it simply asks us to evaluate our beliefs, and to question the status quo.
I was a lighting designer for a production of this (both parts!) while I was in college, and it opened my eyes then.  To see a movie made of it is simply wonderful.  I think Kushner did a wonderful job translating it for the screen.  The director I worked under always said this play was really a film, and he was absolutely right.
I refuse to call this a movie because to me a movie is just another thing to watch.  This is truly a film.  It is film at it's finest, coming together with theatre to truly touch our hearts.  Please, see this film.  You will walk away asking yourself more questions than you ever thought possible.",1078444800,91,1151,4.306976744186047
2004255,5,B0001I2BUI,"This series took my breath away. Tony Kushner has truly created a work that will transcend time, living on for so long, and this movie a actually does the play justice. I read the play before I saw the HBO film, and I must admit that I didn't think that they would even compare, but the acting, the direction, and, of course, the writing were phenominal. All of the stars play their role with the utmost perfection. This is honestly one of the best movies of all time.",1077667200,18,468,4.329545454545454

Going from shocked to hate to broken hearted and then some was just an emotional rollicoster but well worth ever second because it really made you feel what was going on in the scene.
