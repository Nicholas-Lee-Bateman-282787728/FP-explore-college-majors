8044904,2,B00076IWJ8,It became quickly apparent that this is primarily an art film.  Unfortunately the special effects detracted from the interestings clips where the scientists spoke on the topic of evolution.  The distorted voice segments were frustrating in that you could only understand a few words here and there.  Overall disappointing.,1157846400,2,322,5.530612244897959
8044905,5,B00076IWJ8,"Stunning visuals and theme supportive structure put this doc firmly in my ""must see"" category. Evolutionary theory presented with all the wonder and color of possibility...I've never been so eager to re-experience a lecture. You will want to watch this over and over. If you like your scientific theory mixed with liberal doses of art, this is the doc for you.",1152748800,2,360,4.918032786885246
