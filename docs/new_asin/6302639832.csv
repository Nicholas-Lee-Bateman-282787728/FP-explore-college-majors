7828196,5,6302639832,"I wanted to purchase because I'm in the mix of collecting any and all history of 'My Uncle Sam Chatmon' and his half Brother Bo.  I really liked this piece of history and the VHS as a whole!  This is my Dad's (the late, Willie Chatman, Sr.) father's brother!  My Dad changed the last name spelling (from the 'o' to 'a' in the last ending of our last name) when he went into the U.S. Army.

I found out this was a common thing that was sometimes done.  I'm currently researching the reason why.

In listening to much of his music....I find it interestingly telling stories; some whimsical, funny but most of all...I'M LOVING IT!

He also has many documentaries/interviews that folks have done with him that are out their.  Many 'FAMOUS' people knew him and I found out material that, Bonnie Raitt, from a fund set up, dedicated a memorial plague in his honor!  Thanks Bonnie!

Check this documentary medley of Blues singers out yall!  I think you'll love it!!!

Thanks too to the Seller where I bought it!  This was a smooth transaction from beginning to end!",1382572800,,1058,4.534391534391534
