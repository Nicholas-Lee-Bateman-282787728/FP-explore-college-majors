1404459,5,B000059H6U,I noticed that a couple of reviewers don't seem to notice that the dvd-rom also contained two episodes of the tv series. I loved the extra episodes and the story of big al. The animation seem to be even better than the original series was. All in all wonderful.,993600000,,261,4.346938775510204
1404460,5,B000059H6U,"Let me get a few things out of the way.
First of all, Walking with Dinosaurs was great.  Sometimes the special effects were less than perfect, but it was all excusable.
However, I thought it unfortunate that we never got to see just one species as it interacted with others.  WWD seemed to cover more the stories of communities of dinosaurs, unlike the classic documentaries that follow a single pride of lions, or a pod of whales, and the like.
But it was great, and just as the original captured the big picture, Allosaurus captures the details.  The special effects are flawless, the story is well-worked and realistic, everything works.  If you like dinosaurs, liked Walking with Dinosaurs, or enjoy documentaries, try out Allosaurus.  He was my favorite as a kid, and I love seeing them do justice to the ancient beast.
One gripe.  The music needs to stop.  Good documentaries are only natural sound.  BBC melodramatizes when it scores the action.  But I tune it out.",992304000,4,972,4.772455089820359

As with any subject there are certain pros and cons to the subject-what color?How do we really know what they did? Based on their approach,I feel they used a great deal of sound judgement in deciding how to present a possible story. I hope more of these videos will be coming our way! They at least try to give a real feel to the period.  An approach to dinosaurs a long time in coming and welcomed!",989884800,4,487,4.180851063829787

I don't need  anymore wall paper or a screen savers I just was expecting some educational  information  for my grandkid and got very little. I wasted my money on this one.

1404463,4,B000059H6U,"A follow-up from BBC's wonderful 'Walking with Dinosaurs' series, this two part video looks at the life of Big Al, a fossil allosaurus from the Jurassic era.  Here in Australia, this was called 'The Ballad of Big Al'.
The first episode looks at the life of Big Al over his life of seven years - from birth to death.  Al leads a full life, but it certainly isn't an easy one.  You get to see all aspects of Al's life, both as predator and prey, eating, sleeping and trying to have sex.  It was a little frustrating in that it doesn't run as long as I would have liked.
The second episode details the science upon which Al's life was based.  The fossil is described, and what it tells us about events in Al's life are pointed out.  In addition from the specific evidence of Al's fossillised skeleton, some general assumptions about allosauruses and their lives are shown, with reference to the modern day descendants of dinosaurs.  This episode explains why the previous didn't go as long as I would have liked - because they only showed what could be justified.  If they'd made things up, there could have been more - but everything in the first episode is justified in this.
The recreation of dinosaurs is better in this show is better than its predecessor - certainly in regard to their interaction.  In the original series, we either had groups of dinosaurs carrying out similar activities or small number interacting.  In this one, for example, the scene of several allosuruses attacking a herd of diplodicuses is wonderful, and I think better than could have been achieved in the original.
If you like 'Walking with Dinosaurs', this may suit you - always provided, of course, that you are happy to deal with a smaller focus.",986601600,21,1728,4.636065573770492

1404515,2,B000059H6U,"The title of this DVD is misleading.  By calling it ""The ** Complete ** Dino Dynasty"" one is led to think that this is the entire series, but it's actually only season 1, which covered the dinosaurs. Season 2 was post-dinosaur, encompassing the beasts.  I fired this DVD up for my now-grown daughter to relive her favorite childhood show and she immediately says ""that's not the right voice!"" Turns out Christian Slater narrated season 2, and Ben Stiller did season 1.  Upon searching, I find that only season 1 has been released to DVD.  So there you have it.  If you're a Ben Stiller fan (I'm not), you may enjoy it, but I found his narration to be droning and uninterested at best. I did my best to hear Mr. Robot's voice in my head, but alas, I only hear Zzzoolander. In any case, I also got the original BBC ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" with Kenneth Branagh and it's very good. I'll save this for my grandkids, if a) I ever get any and b) if DVD players are still a thing by then.

It takes you from his birth to his untimely demise. The highlight to me and what makes this movie one to watch is the spectacular hunt where a pack of allosaurids attack a herd of diplodicus.

If you enjoyed Walking with Dinosaurs, this is an extension of it, all about the life of one Allosaurus.

The story they tell, and the way they recreate his every footstep, has you feeling for the guy, even though he lived, and died over 250 million years ago.

1404607,3,B000059H6U,"I like this old special. Allosaurus are my favorite dinosaur. However, as is typical of the original series, this Walking with Dinosaur special in corporates the possible ""life"" of this particular fossil find, based on the scarring on the bones. The process itself is not unusual and forensic pathologists use this technique routinely to assist in the solving of deaths.
Unfortunately for us, and Al, he died while still a young adult and so his life, and by extension this video, is short.  This is the only reference in walking with dinosaurs series to the Allosaurus so this is all we can get. which is why there is only an ""average"" for my rating.
the information that is presented very well with the bone injuries being showcased, so the viewer understands why the proposition is given as it is.
the CGI is, as usual, very well done. The puppets less so. the problem with the puppets all the way through the series is that they don't resemble the CGI so its obvious when used.",1393113600,,981,4.637931034482759

1404633,5,B000059H6U,"***This review may contain spoilers**

  As another reviewer has already mentioned, ""Allosaurus: A Walking with Dinosaurs Special"" (hereafter ""Allo"") is essentially the seventh episode of that magnificent pseudo-documentary series, and maintains that series lofty production and narrative standards (including retaining Kenneth Branaugh as solemn narrator).  I think ""Allo"" was created in response to some ineffable clamor for carnivore balance.  In other words, T-rex had his own episode on ""Walking with Dinosaurs""; now it's Allosaurus's turn to shine.

  The first 30 minutes of ""Allo"" chronicles the relatively short but painfully eventful life of an Allosaurus, christened ""Big Al"".  We follow his life from a tiny hatchling to a nearly full-grown subadult. He encounters stegosaurs.  He participates in a rousing diploducus hunt with others of his kind.  He attempts to woo a much larger, more mature, and definitely more ferocious female allosaur.  Throughout his life, Big Al was basically the carnivorous theropod's answer to Evel Knievel.  He suffered bites, scratches, lacerations, and bone dislocations, especially to his feet and legs.  The litany of injuries finally takes its toll on Big Al, eventually losing his hunting ability and succumbing to starvation and thirst.

  As I was watching ""Allo"", I was astonished by many things.  For example, how did a hatchling the size of a pigeon grow to be a 3-4 ton apex predator?  Also, where did Big Al's mother get her maternal instinct, enabling her to protect her brood like a mother crocodile from predators, including, unsuccessfully, against a cannibalistic male allosaur?  How many of Big Al's nest mates survived along with him (probably not too many; allosaur chicks, like croc babies, probably had a very high mortality rate)?  Did Allosaurs really cooperate to take down gigantic prey like Diplodocus?  Did sexual dimorphism really exist among allosaurs, meaning size differences among the sexes, in this case females larger than males? Some of these questions are addressed in the second 30-minute half of ""Allo"", where fossil analysis speculates upon Big Al's life and provided inspiration for the first half.

  One thing stood out prominently in ""Allo"": Big Al and his ilk may have been at the top of the food chain during the Jurassic, but their lives were far from easy.  Despite their size, allosaurs must have had a tough time against the larger herbivores.  As I recall, Big Al meets two stegosaurs but decides not to attack them, probably because of their sharp spiked tails and aggressive posture.  During the thrilling diplodocus hunt on the salt flats, it takes three(!) allosaurs, including Big Al several hours to bring down even a sick, overheated member of the herd.  Even after they start to consume the multi-ton carcass, a bigger female allosaurus arrives and threatens to claim the kill as her own.  Speaking of females, Big Al's clumsy attempt to woo a female allosaurus literally ends in crushing failure.  Most importantly, an allosaurus's feet and legs were its fortune; any serious damage to either could spell doom.  Big Al breaks one of his middle toes while chasing one of the bipedal, relatively small Dryosaurs - a fatal wound for any hunter, but especially a two-legged one.

  Both halves of the ""Allo"" disk provide intriguing scientific, paleontological, and zoological information about Big Al and his world.  Of course, some of this information is speculative, which may put off some viewers, just as it may have done with the ""Walking..."" series.  Also, a few viewers may disapprove of giving a dinosaur a name, as if he were a harmless pet, because it may lessen his dignity. Phffft! I think chances are you will enjoy learning about Big Al's life and death in ""Allo"".  After all, T-rex has had enough press.",1335225600,,3817,5.166394779771615

The series won a emmy and it deserves a place in history because it helped to bring about a greater understanding of the bird-dinosaur link.

""Walking with Dinosaurs""

Walking with Dinosaurs Program Description:

The Journey begins 220 million years ago with a trip back in time to the reign of the dinosaurs!

Using the latest scientific findings, Walking with Dinosaurs examines the 155-million-year history of these great creatures, from the aggressive Coelophysis, the first animal to hunt in a pack, to Tyrannosaurus Rex, the most terrifying carnivore on the planet. Feel the ground tremble as dueling Triceratops (that's a mistake, they're actually called Torosaurus in the program) lock horns, and soar with Ornithocheirus, who could travel over 300 miles on a single flap of his powerful wings.

Program Titles:

1. NEW BLOOD

2. TIME OF THE TITANS

3. CRUEL SEA

4. GIANT OF THE SKIES

5. SPIRITS OF THE ICE FOREST

6. DEATH OF A DYNASTY

Extras:

- 29 minutes of behind-the-scenes picture-in-picture footage

- 50 minute ""making of"" documentary

- Promotional trailers

This is an excellent program, and definitely my personal favorite of the three. Everything is incredibly realistic, to the CGI models, animatronics, locations, and even the story-lines. I must have watched it at least 10 times by now. (and I'm only talking about this DVD collection; I must have watched this series 50 times on our VHS recording)

The features are very good, and filled with plenty of jokes with the dinosaurs not doing what they're supposed to and the like. It's really neat to see them on location filming nothing or creating the animatronics and what-not. All the other features are excellent too.

""Allosaurus - A Walking with Dinosaurs Special""

Allosaurus - A Walking with Dinosaurs Special and Big Al Uncovered Program Descriptions:

In 1991, the most complete allosaurus skeleton ever found was discovered in Wyoming and fondly nicknamed ""Big Al"". Through careful excavation and restoration, scientists have pieced together a detailed biography of this one dinosaur. Using the same computer graphics and animatronics techniques that amazed viewers all over the world in ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", this program vividly recreates the 15 years from Al's birth to his untimely demise.

In Big Al Uncovered, Al haunts modern-day museums and dig sites as scientists explain how they picked up clues and traced the evidence of one dinosaur's life story.

Extras:

- Picture-in-picture sequence with over 40 storyboards

- Photo gallery

- CD-ROM sampler of screensavers, video clips, wallpaper and more

Just as good as ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and very interesting to see more of Allosaurus from the second program from ""Dinosaurs"".

Big Al Uncovered was also very interesting and, again quite amusing. The rest of the features were also very good.

""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts""

Walking with Prehistoric Beasts Program Description:

When the dinosaurs disappeared from the Earth, they did not leave an empty planet behind them. A succession of extraordinary creatures came and went over the following millennia. The award-winning team behind ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and ""Allosaurus"" invites you to take a trip to this amazing new world. Here, flightless birds as tall as a man kill with a single snap of their powerful beaks, early ancestors of man struggle for power and territory as they try to defend themselves from the famous saber-toothed tiger. And even the saber-tooth cannot take on the Glyptodon - the massive two-ton armadillo that is the most heavily armored mammal ever.

It's an extraordinary trip through history and evolution that begins with the end of the dinosaurs and ends with the rise of even more mysterious creatures... the first humans.

Program Titles:

1. NEW DAWN

2. WHALE KILLER

3. LAND OF GIANTS

4. NEXT OF KIN

5. SABRE TOOTH

6. MAMMOTH JOURNEY

Extras:

- Two 50 minute behind-the-scenes featurettes

- Interviews with the creators

- Fact files

- Photo gallery

- Storyboards

I felt, although this was almost as good as the first two, it was a little off its mark. Some camera shots could not really be filmed realistically, (like a Basilosaurus engulfing the camera with its mouth, effectively eating the cameraman) which took a little away from the realism, but this didn't happen very often. And, I personally could have lived without the slow-motion scenes. I also thought they focused a little too much on the hunting aspect, but again they didn't overdo it. Still a great program, and really neat to see some prehistoric mammals which are often overlooked.

The features are also quite good, and the interviews with the creators were very interesting.

The video transfer for all three are perfect as well as the sound, and all the features are very interesting and pretty funny too.

All in all, this collection is top-notch and quality entertainment, highly recommended!",1216252800,55,5144,5.169491525423729

Highly recommend starting with the film ""Origins"" that has great graphics and description of the forming of the earth and our solar system (however would have been greater with a brief description of the ""Big Bang"" theory) and then follow this series with ""Walking with Cavemen"" to cover human evolution.

One citicism, which actually extends back to the Speilberg classics. Why the human-like facial and body mannerisms? I can understand how kids might be scared by the ""real deal"", an entity terrifying enough to make even Spiderman take flight.
In think, in 2008, even the ""kiddies"" can take a stronger dose of dino-reality. There was no cuteness.

The Journey starts with the first dinosaurs in a struggle to survive a brutal desert. Then you travel ahead to the Jurassic, where you follow the life of a baby sauropod, or ""longneck"" for fans of ""The Land Before Time"" movies, and explore the vast ancient seas. Then, it's on ahead to the Cretaceous, where you with fly with pterosaurs, or ""flyers"", survive a harsh winter in the South Pole forests, and see the dinosaurs go extinct when a comet hits the Earth. But the journey is far from over. Now you follow the lives of the creatures that lived after the dinosaurs. You will see a forest ruled by a giant killer bird, a giant whale try to survive pregnancy, a baby giraffe-like rhino survive his first few years, the apes that will evolve into humans try to survive in the savannah, a saber-tooth cat fight for his home, and a herd of Woolly Mammoths travel to greener pastures for the winter. If you love dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures, then this series can't be beat! Buy now and enjoy it for years to come!

It is done in the style of a wildlife documentary, and the effects are so realistic that it is easy to ""go along for the ride"" and believe that you are watching dinosaurs being filmed in their natural habitat.  The storytelling is also quite engaging.

I haven't seen it in a while, but from what I remember it walked through each phase of the the dinosaurs life on the planet from Triassic, Jurrassic, Cretaceous, going through dinosaurs that you may never heard of, how they lived, died, survived, preyed on each other, etc.

It's not for everyone. I can see someone with a slight passing interest in dinosaurs and the period enjoying fifteen minutes or so then becoming bored, so I say rent it first through Netflix because I haven't seen reruns of it in a while.

Dinosaur fans should very much enjoy, and even kids should like it because there are computerize images with the voice overs and while it is educational they should learn something about each species and each period, not just Jurassic because of ""Jurassic Park""  Very well done, I recommend.",1164931200,26,886,4.740259740259741

The story is about his life, which was only 15 years long.  60 minutes, half of which is the story and half of which is about how they figured out what they did from the bones.

I kind of feel sorry for Big Al.  He had a REALLY tough life and we don't even know if he ever got to have offspring or not.  Was he a father of dozens of Allosaurus babies or did his genes end with his death? Extras also include a photo gallery and storyboards.",1105747200,8,697,4.0144927536231885

Superb computer graphics and animatronics create the believable dinosaurs. There is suspense,action and tradgedy,as well as humor and fun woven into the story. One negative comment is with the location of the filming. It is filmed in Utah and Arizona,which do not look quite accurate,but the extensive research and realistic dinosaurs balance it out.

I used to imagine what it would have been like when those skeletons I saw on exhibit lived, and how someone needed to play tour guide to that realm and how I should twist the handle. Sadly, no matter how I tried that doorway, it always remained closed, my time machine not quite working the way I would have intended, and dinosaurs were left either in bone formation or in the movies as monsters.
There was never an in-between.
With the creation of the Walking With Dinosaurs series, however, everything began to change and I, still that boy with an interest in that hobby, found myself addicted. The key that separated this series and made it ""unique"" - a word I try to use sparingly - is in the way the dinosaurs, our main actors and actresses, are portrayed. Instead of turning then into a depiction of a colossal, toothy menace or dryly discussing their lifespan in the way one discusses ancient relics, the series showcases dinosaurs by allowing one to walk with them through their terrain. From the flora and the fauna, the insect life and dinosaurs themselves, a depiction of CGI effects, prosthetics, and of ""dinosaur knowing"" comes to life. Here, you see the landscape the way it would have been, the animals roaming free and observed naturalistically, and the experience is incredible because it looks so vibrantly realistic.
In Allosaurus: A Walking With Dinosaurs Special, the Allosaurus ""Big Al"" is showcased as he struggles from the cradle while trying to grow into something fearsome. In sixty minutes, the fifteen years from the egg to the eventual demise it faces are depicted, showing a person that going to the head of the class wasn't easy in that age.  Here, other dinosaurs walk as well, and the efforts of one of the top predators of its age seem a tad on the hard side - making me rethink the allure of being the biggest kid on the block. Survival while growing, it is dramatic and enlightening experience, and its pretty interesting how harrowing an introduction can be and how brutal it can be.
For anyone that has yet to watch this series, I'd recommend tuning in as soon as possible and catching up on all those moments you missed out on. I would recommend starting with Walking With Dinosaurs, however, and moving on from there. Still, that is far from being a bad thing. Besides this video that focuses on Big Al and a few of species, other DVDs house other forms of life that are entrancing. Wonderfully fast predators, Megladons swimming the high tides and eating enough to be interesting, and other strange species await you. And they, all the DVDs released thusfar in this series, simply look fantastic.",1058140800,35,2713,4.687631027253669
1404736,5,B000059H6U,"The ""seventh"" episode of the spectacularly successful ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" series, ""Allosaurus"" - better known as ""The Ballad of Big Al"" outside the US - is a extraordinary follow-up to that series.  It also served to whet many fans' appetite for the later ""Prehistoric Beasts"" series.
In ""Allosaurus"", we followed the life of ""Big Al"" literally from birth to the grave.  Life wasn't all ""blood in tooth and claw"" for the top predator in Jurassic America, as we're shown.  As a baby, Al had to watch for predators, especially his own kind!  He had to literally teach himself to hunt, and some prey was just too big to take on without help.  And mating was no pinic either; Al needs more than flowers to win a female's heart.
As a sequel of sorts to ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", ""Allosaurus"" does quite well.  We're treated to the same CGI and animatronic effects seen in the previous series, and while the puppetry still needs a little work, IMHO, the CGI is top notch.  All of the dinosaurs featured in the episode ""Time of the Titans"" - Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, and Stegosaurus - return here.  Three more dinosaurs are added to the cast; Dryosaurus, Othnelia, and the famous Apatosaurus.  As with ""Dinosaurs"", there is a ""Making of..."" episode, included on the VHS, giving us insight into the research of what is one of the most recognizable predatory dinosaurs, second only to Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor.
While ""Allosaurus"" is a wonderful series, I do have one little complaint.  Surely the Framestore and BBC teams could have added a few more dinosaurs to the episode.  They didn't need to have added more sauropods; three is enough.  But what about Ceratosaurus, or Camptosaurus, both contemparies of Allosaurus?  Surely both these dinosaurs could have been included, especially since its likely Ceratosaurus could have competed with Allosaurus for the same food source.
Despite this ""flaw"", ""Allosaurus"" is a fine follow-up to ""Dinosaurs"".  Part of the continuing ""Walking with..."" series, which now includes ""Prehistoric Beasts"", ""Chased by Dinosaurs"", and now ""Walking with Cavemen"", ""Allosaurus"" definately belongs in anyone's collection.  And here's a message to the folks at the BBC: please, *please* do something about the time *before* the dinosaurs.",1055980800,13,2270,5.147138964577657

1404738,5,B000059H6U,"I loved the BBC's documentary series ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" so much, that when I saw this by them , I did not waste any time to get it ordered. It's not as long as Walking w/Dinosaurs but  they tried to keep this story on Big Al. It's the same look and feel as Walk w/ Dino , so if you liked it , you will like this one. Also I think you should consider looking at BBC's ""Walking With Pre-Historic Beasts"" , it's equally as good, with newer and awesome animals.",1026604800,,463,4.087912087912088
1404739,5,B000059H6U,"The story of ""Big Al,"" is a big hit with my 4-year-old son (and with me). This program was not produced specifically for kids, but the narration is clear and obviously comprehensible to viewers of all ages. I'm a big believer in not ""dumbing-down"" dialogue for the sake of children. Kids become motivated to learn -- and they do learn -- when they are challenged to understand what's going on around them. My kids want to know what mom and dad are talking about and what's going on in the world. So, they wrestle with the concepts that elude them and ask questions to fill in the blanks. ""Allosaurus"" has obvious dinosaur appeal, and it's truly educational and challenging. Some scenes deal with injury and death. I'd recommend that you preview the disc before showing it to your own children. In that vein, I recommend that you avoid ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" for your kids. It's far more violent and intense than ""Allosaurus.""",1018310400,3,936,4.748466257668712
1404740,4,B000059H6U,"Well,I have to say that I have seen this one,and it was better than the usual ""Walking with Dinosaurs"". This time,they have a real storyline,although it`s just a documentary film. And the dinosaurs seems a lot more full of life,although their look isn`t different. It`s a pity these series were not included in the book.
I this 30-minute special,we follow the allosaurus named Al from beeing an egg to his death. In fact,this could truly have been the life of an allosaur. But there are still a few things which I don`t understand (and it has happend TOO many times in ""Walking with Dinosaurs""): why does he always start arguing with a female of his own kind?Why didn`t they let him fight another male to get the female instead?That would have been a little more realistic (and a more usual thing to happen in the dinosaur world as well).
Well,I know the filmmakers weren`t made out of cash,but I think this documentary could have been a little longer - 30 minutes was too short. It should have been about an hour. Then we would probably have had more time too learn about Al`s dangerous and wondrous world,and the fantastic creatures living there.
Still,I think this was a very nice addition to BBC`s most expensive project so far,and it is recommended watching both for dino-loving kids as well as for adults and anyone interested in dinosaurs & computer animations.",1011398400,7,1368,4.7521008403361344
1404741,5,B000059H6U,"WE came across this on the BBC while traveling in Scotland, and my kids (3&7) were enthralled.  We could not get them moving, even with the coaxing of castles and the Loch Ness Monster.  To be honest, my wife and I enjoyed it enough to sit with them.
It tells a great story, with great animation and teaches while being honestly entertaining.  It is one of those that finds that perfect balance.  Do not buy it for any DVD extras, that is not the point.  It is just a great show.  The other place to find it is in the Natural History Museum in London, and a lot of the money made from those items ""shilled"" go to continue this kind of BBC programing and the phenominal work done at the museum.
To sum it up---I gave my children the choice of this or Pokemon and they took this.  I rec. it to anyone with children who like dinosaurs.",999216000,6,832,4.19496855345912
