8444488,5,B002R0EUHU,"The film does an exceptional job of giving the viewer first hand and close up insight of one of the more dramatic struggles taking place these days.

For me getting a real feel for what makes these activists willing to risk themselves physically and risk alienation from their society was priceless.

The events are dramatic yet the filmmaker does not loose sight of the humanity of his characters.

In short it has all the makings of an excellent documentary.",1256342400,2,460,4.7974683544303796
8444489,5,B002R0EUHU,"This movie documents how the Israel-Palestine conflict get people to be so extremely activists, risking their lives in order to say their words. This movie is a slap to your face, especially if you are Israeli.",1254873600,2,210,4.861111111111111
