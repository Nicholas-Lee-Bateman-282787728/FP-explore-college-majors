5905302,5,B00EDVNCW0,"This low budget comedy delivers some nice laughs and while the female character are a bit underdeveloped - this is all about the boys. Josh Folan and especially Avery Pearson deliver strong performances as stoner/slackers who drag their girlfriends into the woods to make a video to impress their TV survival show host idol, Bear.
Beautifully shot and there are even some surprisingly nice tender moments. AMC's Hell on Wheels star, Phil Burke has a small role as the douchey brother.
Definitely worth checking out!",1392163200,2,515,5.070588235294117

5905304,5,B00EDVNCW0,"I'm a big Channing Tatum, and Josh Folan is the Channing Tatum of independent film.  A modern masterpiece for the millennial generation.",1382832000,,136,5.181818181818182
5905305,5,B00EDVNCW0,One of the best independent movies I've seen this year. Josh Folan is a rising talent in the indie film scene. Also great performance from Hell On Wheels star Phil Burke. Also check out Josh's book about film making.,1382832000,,216,4.564102564102564
5905306,5,B00EDVNCW0,"Very refreshing to see a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  You can tell the writing happened very spontaneously.  Good music and creative use of editing.  Cutaways to past events very funny.  Overall, a good debut from Josh Folan.

You will laugh.  You could try masturbating too, but the results may be varied.",1382832000,,324,4.907407407407407

8604330,3,B00EDVNCW0,"It's kind of funny.  It sort of reminded me of Dude Where's My Car in spirit.  The plot isn't similar, but it's got some similarities.  Two dumb but funny friends bumbling their way through life.  It's pretty low budget though.  In fact, at 39:20, you can totally see a microphone come down into the shot on the right side.  In fact, I don't know how you could miss it. Not sure how that got past editing, but it's an ok movie if you've got the time to kill.",1512345600,,458,4.1477272727272725

8604333,4,B00EDVNCW0,"Surprisingly funny! Needed a bit more on the sound bites but overall a great flick! Two bros trying to replicate survival like their survival idol along with their girlfriends out in the middle of no where. A great survival ""spoof"" film to watch, not for the whole family because of some adult language and content but something to watch if you are interested in some of the ""survival"" shows out there. Maybe it's me, but the humor needed a bit more punch but it was still overall funny.",1491955200,,487,4.545454545454546
8604334,5,B00EDVNCW0,"A great little film about awakening. The characters are great and the comedy is dead pan. The humor is a lot like clerks but more organic and absurdist. If you need to smile, watch Vaughn and the gang go wild!",1483401600,,209,4.25
8604335,5,B00EDVNCW0,Antics in the woods done right. Really fun and easy watch if you want to have a few or lots of laughs,1473897600,,101,3.6363636363636362
8604336,5,B00EDVNCW0,"Endearingly inept stoners in the woods trying to do what everyones kinda thought about doing after seeing just one episode of Man vs. Wild. Whats not to like? Watching a good slacker dude comedy always sends me into college nostalgia. This movie is just the right amount of light-hearted, bumbling bro comedy needed after a 12-hour work day. The hilarious premise and funny dialogue had me laughing while I cracked open another Natty Light.",1467849600,,440,4.95945945945946
