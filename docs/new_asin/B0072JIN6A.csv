5051817,4,B0072JIN6A,I don't think it is exciting enough for my 13 month old. I think he is too young for this set yet. It is not as jam packed with fun like the new Wiggles dvds. Still good stuff!,1389916800,,176,3.6578947368421053

All three are the best out there. My daughters love all three, but their favorite is You Make me feel like Dancing. They can watch it over and over again for ever!!! I even enjoy it too! They dance until they drop! We even dance with them too! Awesome entertainment for kids. Good buy for the price too, as you will be saving some bucks if were to buy the three all separate.",1375488000,4,525,4.1568627450980395

I may have to buy a third set if they can't stop grabbing the discs.  Good price for a great collection!,1366848000,,365,3.9452054794520546

5051824,5,B0072JIN6A,"This is coming from a grown up aimed at other grown ups who might have to sit through hours and hours of repeated playing of these shows. Even though this is the remake of Wiggle Time, the original is so charming in a home made cardboard car sort of way, the shows from this era with their mix of simple colorful sets and some computer effects are easy on the nerves. This is where a lot of the songs and clips we know them for come from. Greg Page's happy dance at the beginning of Get Ready to Wiggle is about one of the most joyful things you'll ever see.

You Make Me Feel Like Dancing is one of the better shows from the Sam era. The Shimmy Shake is one of his best Wiggles numbers he doesn't use his opera voice for and he looks like he's enjoying this one a bit more. The show is well paced and they go from disco to ballroom to ballet showing off different dances and hopefully getting you off the couch to do something. It might be turning off the DVD during Minnie the Moocher, instrumental, if the cat noises get to be too much. I like the credits where we hear what The Wiggles' favorite parts are and get to see the people inside Wags, Henry, and Dorothy.

It's Here Comes the Big Red Car that starts off well then drives off a cliff. It's a remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wiggles-Dance-Party/dp/B000088UXB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wiggles - Dance Party</a>&nbsp;which is interesting as it's the oldest show available and proves just how much it's the Wiggles themselves that drive the show. Yes it's the same Anthony, his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-I-Got-My-Wiggle-Back-A-Memoir-of-Healing/dp/B006HW13CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How I Got My Wiggle Back: A Memoir of Healing</a>&nbsp;chronicles the transformation.

Things in HCBRC go fine as long as it's The Wiggles and their friends in moderation, it's the pirate crew that wear on adult nerves. On one hand you can try and figure out who are the characters, Wags, Henry, and Dorothy are among them, and who are the Wiggles' and Captain Feathersword's understudies. (kids might ask why Sam is a pirate and not a Wiggle here) On the other hand you might wish the SS Feathersword would capsize just to see who among them would sink or swim. One of the pirates was still touring with them by 2012 Celebration and it wasn't Sam.",1364860800,6,2414,5.014962593516209

8508962,5,B0072JIN6A,"You may be squeamish at watching a bunch of guys sing and dance around and no doubt many of the stories and skits are silly, but this is good clean fun for your kids with very singable original songs and good clean messages. There is respect for adults, encouraging kids to eat their vegi's, no making fun of each other at the other's expense, learning how to cross the road the right way... lots of other messages in a fun presentation. My kids loved this and I still have the songs stuck in my head although we haven't played this for a year or so. I bought this for my brother and his new baby because it is now one of my standard new child gifts.",1423353600,,650,4.166666666666667

I saw another reviewer mention that the parts with Captain Feathersword are a bit long and I can confirm this; our child starts to lose interest during these parts but still enjoys them overall.",1417996800,,351,4.67741935483871
