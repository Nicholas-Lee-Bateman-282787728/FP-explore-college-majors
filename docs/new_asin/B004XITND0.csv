8446948,3,B004XITND0,"Loved remembering Playland.  I only wish it went into more detail and that there were more pictures.  Overall, I enjoyed remembering a very special time in my life.  I recommend it for anyone who wishes to ""take a look back"" at the Good O'l Days.",1496880000,,246,4.4222222222222225

8446951,5,B004XITND0,I am a bit jealous of you old folks who been to play land when you were young in the 50's it sounds like fun heck I'm 25 and if sanfrancisco was not over populated today I wish this playland was still existed instead of me going to six flags at Vallejo or going to great America at sanjose it is just too long of a drive it would be cool if they bring back playland .,1395878400,,367,3.779220779220779
8446952,5,B004XITND0,I love the whole Lands End area and would have loved to see Playland at the Beach when growing up but I was from the Peninsula and my parents never brought us there.  This video is the next best thing.  It is well done and gives you a feel for what it was like.  I would recommend it.,1389225600,,284,3.8620689655172415
8446953,5,B004XITND0,Very well presented and gave some information I wasn't aware of even though I spend my wild youth in and around the place.,1357516800,2,122,4.3478260869565215
8446954,4,B004XITND0,"I grew up in SF in the 50's and used to take the Muni down Sloat to the Beach very often.  If I was lucky enough to have a couple of bucks, I would choose the big black stallion on the Carousel and have a ball pretending I was a princess out for a ride on her castle grounds.  I also rode the other rides including the Dodge Cars.  They were all great.  Now when I visit the area I feel such a sense of loss.  Just a bunch of Condos.  If only they had valued the site we might still be able to visit.  This film was a bit amateurish.  But what was is now gone.  It was good to see a small glimpse anyway.",1327449600,6,604,3.7301587301587302
8446955,5,B004XITND0,"What a wonderful DVD! I grew up going to Playland in San Francisco and this brought back all the great memories. It goes into the history of it from beginning to end. It takes you down the tall wooden slides that we used to go down using burlap sacks. It shows the turntable,the Big Dipper rollercoaster and so much more. Great interviews with people who worked there as well as participants. They even include a little tour of ""Playland-Not-At-The-Beach"" which has memorabilia from the original one. This is a precious treasure.",1326240000,9,529,4.824175824175824
