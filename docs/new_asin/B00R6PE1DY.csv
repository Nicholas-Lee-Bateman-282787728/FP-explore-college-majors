6901432,3,B00R6PE1DY,"Great movie and the blu ray adaptation was great. Great quality release. The only problem I have with the release is that the ending theme wasn't in the movie! The ending theme Grace Omega was my favorite part of the movie the first time I saw it and it wasn't even a part of this release. There was no music or noise of any kind as the credits rolled. It was really annoying to me which is why I gave it the three stars. You might think this is a small thing, if so go ahead and bump my review up to five stars, but as it stands the movie was not complete..",1423008000,7,558,3.9469026548672566
6901433,4,B00R6PE1DY,"The picture quality of this disc easily bests the old Bandai DVD.  The DTS-MA 5.1 audio track is an explosive feast for the ears!  My only complaint is that the film seems to vibrate a little bit (meaning the picture looks like it is shaking a little bit).  This, however, may be the fault of the source material.  Perhaps Discotek media is not to blame?  This disc is definitely a worthy upgrade!",1422576000,3,397,4.458333333333333
6901434,1,B00R6PE1DY,"The first ten minutes is good
We see the whole town at war
The special armored forces
But once thats all over, its all boring drama of
A written tale based off of lil red riding hood
The main male character suffers daytime nightmares from the  bloody onslaught  underground were he refuses to kill the boy/girl character who btw is on the cover art but doesnt live long. The guy is taken off the job having to retrain and looses any interest. Very lame.
A brigade is a number of people. 100's
1000's

6901437,5,B00R6PE1DY,"Just go to YouTube and watch Demolition D's review of this movie. Only thing that can do it justice.
Great quality Blu-Ray, amazing animation, amazing sound effects and music, amazing dark and deep story. What's not to love?!
Highly recommended ^^",1471046400,6,247,5.048780487804878
6901438,4,B00R6PE1DY,Movie is a 5.  A bit disappointed that the end credit song audio does not work when the film ends on the japanese dub.  I had to switch over to the english audio and that worked find.  Bit of a hiccup in an otherwise great release.,1469750400,,231,3.9782608695652173
6901439,5,B00R6PE1DY,"A unique political drama/love story/ action movie with a very interesting premise.  The animation in it is superb and very well done.  The characters are interesting and feel very real within the setting.  The story focuses around a member of a heavily armed police unite in a alternate 1950s Japan where Germany has taken control.  The movie is a perfect blend of drama, character depth, and action, with some great animation to back it all up.  It explores many ideas like if man can ever truly become more than a beast and has many other metaphors and symbolism in it.  It's not just a good anime, but a good movie just in general.  I highly recommend watching this movie even if your not a fan of anime.  The story is very well written with an actually interesting twist in the third act.  The ending is very emotional and does leave you with a lot to think about.  While there are action sences in this movie, I wouldn't call it an action movie.  It's more of a drama if anything, but it does have a very interesting setting and the story is so well written that I would still recommend at least giving this movie a try.",1469404800,,1125,4.412621359223301
6901440,5,B00R6PE1DY,"I originally viewed this movie through the local library (shockingly, it was shelved in the children's section).  My boyfriend and I were immediately taken into the impressive animation.  We had to double check the release date, because the quality was so high, we assumed it was more recent than '99.  As I mentioned earlier, this is NOT a children's movie.  People get riddled through with bullets, a girl is mauled by wolves, people get literally torn apart by bullets, a child suicide bombs herself, did I mention the bullets??

The story is engaging and the characters are sympathetic.  I watched this with English dub, and liked the voice acting, as well.  Neither of us could get over how incredible the animation was.  We both gasped when a character picked a couple of photos up off of a desk== it just looked so beautiful and natural!  Specifically, this motion was such a small detail, but seriously... everything was labored over in this film.  And you can definitely notice their care.",1463011200,2,998,4.85207100591716
6901441,5,B00R6PE1DY,"Great Oshii movie, and now in 1080p!",1444694400,,36,4.285714285714286
6901442,5,B00R6PE1DY,"Jin-Roh is among those animated films that can be considered for ""adults."" It's slow paced and character driven, there are action scenes sprinkled throughout the film and rather violent. If you're looking for non-stop action, you better look elsewhere. But if you like political thrillers mixed with a bit of alternate history, Jin-Roh is definitely an experience you cannot pass up.

The quality of the animation in this movie is superb, you could even say better than most animated films today and Discotek has done a wonderful job with this Blu-Ray transfer, the audio is equally as good allowing you to enjoy the magnificent soundtrack by Hajime Mizoguchi. As for the quality of the english dub, it's decent, certainly will allow you to enjoy the plot.

There are a few extras, such as trailers and a ""making-off"" documentary.

My only complain is that the ending theme of the film ""Omega"" has been silenced completely if you're listening to English audio track, but it's present on the Japanese audio track. Kind of a weird decision for that.",1443052800,4,1047,4.9375

6901444,4,B00R6PE1DY,"Beautiful transfer. Glad it doesn't have the ""black bars"" like the previous version from Bandai. Wish it came packaged like the special edition with the mini-storyboard book. Still beautiful movie; sad but beautiful.",1441065600,2,216,5.575757575757576

6901453,5,B00R6PE1DY,"Unlike previous releases of Jin Roh, the image fills the entire frame. Previously, there was a black border on all sides, but Discotek has eliminated that completely! Props to Discotek for a stellar release, even though this is one of their first blu-ray's.

Note: the picture is slightly shaky, but not that noticable. I suspect that this was also a problem in previous releases, but was not as noticeable due to the windowboxing.

Edit: The ending song is blanked out on the English track, however it is fully intact on the Japanese track. For some reason, there are English translated credits included as an extra, also with the ending music intact. Very confusing!",1423440000,16,668,4.902654867256637

8694326,5,B00R6PE1DY,This has been one of my favorite movies since it first came out.  The movie is slower paced as far as action goes so don't expect a whole lot.

8694333,5,B00R6PE1DY,"One of the best movies I've seen. Top-notch in every way - story, characters, pacing, directing, cinematography, animation. It's incredible how much you're able to gleam about each character: their hopes, dreams, disappointments, etc., as well as their motivations within their relationships with one another. The themes of identity, friendship, group vs. individual, love, loyalty, it's all done phenomenally. Scenes are so well set-up, locations are evocative. There are dream sequences, a ""story within the story"" that is interwoven beautifully, tons of small details that come to light on a second and third viewing that enhance and deepen your understanding of characters' motivations and internal struggles. Truly a masterpiece of animation all the way around.",1493424000,2,766,5.6695652173913045
