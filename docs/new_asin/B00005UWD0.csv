1669013,5,B00005UWD0,"What a great family film! It was visually beautiful and  a great story plot that keeps you interested. The sets, wardrobe, and casting made it a memorable film to bring out your emotions as you watch it.",1377907200,,203,4.486486486486487
1669014,4,B00005UWD0,"This is an interesting movie which centers on a family where the two children, Kyle and Evie Preston discover that their grandmother's country property which is adjacent to an old mine may lead to a doorway between the human world and the fairy realm. Their discovery just might help their father who is terminally ill. There are some scary images of goblin-like creatures in this movie which might be too scary for the under six age group.
The movie is Not Rated, and runs 91 minutes.",1369958400,,485,4.651162790697675
1669015,5,B00005UWD0,It arrived quickly and undamaged. The Grandskids love faries so they really liked it. I  couldn't find it in the store..I would recommened them to anyone.,1361404800,2,154,4.923076923076923
1669016,1,B00005UWD0,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever. The script is terrible, the poor actors had no guidance from a miserable director - his use of the camera is worse than a beginning film school student, I mean no slight to film students by this comparison. Oh, perhaps he wrote the script too? How DID he get this job? He must be someone's son or nephew. One of the worst scripts ever.

The plot is ridiculous, a giant marrying a fairy indeed.  OK, a little willing suspension of disbelief, we are talking fairies here, but the actors were SO just walking through it, uninspired and using every little ""acting"" trick in the book to indicate their emotions.  Even the usually fabulous and interesting Malcolm MacDowell is boring.  They find a GOLD MINE on the property and the wife's reaction is something like, Oh goody, a gold mine.  Her 6 year old daughter says ""yay.""  Please.  I  mean did they all hate each other during the filming or just had nothing but contempt for the director because they were definitely all just taking the money and running.

The fairies are not attractive and the makeup is terrible.  For some reason, they have blue skin and yet, when they open their mouths, you can see the red inside of their lips and tongues.  I mean it is just terrible. Oh and for some reason WE can hear their little wings buzzing away, loudly, but no one else can. Wait til you see the scary ogres.  Ooooo, so scary.  No wait,  do not watch it long enough to see them. Please, please do not waste your money and especially your time on this. If you really must see it, even though you have been warned, find it On Demand and don't pay.  This way you can erase and/or speed through.",1358380800,,1691,4.409677419354839
1669017,1,B00005UWD0,"This movie was more like a horror film.  An entire village is afraid that a family will excavate a mine that is haunted by goblins. The child characters have nightmares that the goblins get out and chase them down, only the nightmares turn out to be true.  The twist ending which reveals the goblins are actually fairies tones the scariness down, but in my opinion, came far too late after scaring my daughter and me out of our wits!  In the meantime, the father of the child characters comes down with a serious illness in which he coughs up blood and will die in a matter of months.

My daughter couldn't sleep the whole night after she watched it, so parents looking for feel-good entertainment for the family should beware.  This isn't it.",1216944000,3,743,4.556390977443609
1669018,5,B00005UWD0,"A delightful little story with no violence, no horror, no frightening monsters. Just lots and lots of little fairies from the same species as Tinkerbell.

It's perfect for the younger children, warm-hearted, with medium pace, and no worries about nightmares later on. The villian is not so villianous, he shakes his fist at children, the family is loyal and loving and the fairy is friendly, but shy. Even the goblins are more bizarre than brutish.

Great for the under-nines",1158624000,16,475,5.0
1669019,3,B00005UWD0,"We just bought the movie 'The Fairy King of Ar'. It is an ok movie. I think it could have been better though. Allot better even. It starts out with a grandmother reading a book to her two grandchildren. The book is about a giant that wanted to marry the fairy king's daughter. They made a deal, but the king did not keep his side of the bargain. The giant gets pissed off and creates a big hole in the ground and grabs all the people of Ar and throws them down in the hole. The grandmother tells her grandchildren that they have to help the fairies escape. Then she dies and they inherit her house and land.

You can guess here what happens next. They move in after that and meet a cousin of the mother's, whom appears to be crazy and believes there are demons in the mine, that is in their yard. When actually the demons really are the fairies.

If you watch them movie closely you can catch all kinds of little mistakes or things that just don't make since. Like the person who wrote the story was in too big of a hurry and just threw it all together without a care. It has plenty of potential to be something better. Mind you, it is still a good movie. Just not the best.

I love the house in the movie and the yard. It was very magical. I also love the fact that there was a mural of Brian Froud's on one of the walls in the house. But the movie never focused on it. The fairies were computer animation. Which is fine and dandy but they were very poorly done. Even the fairies played by real humans could have had better make-up. And that Tombalina looked more like a boy than a girl fairy.

All in all I rate this movie three stars.",1124668800,32,1637,4.122257053291536

7955673,2,B00005UWD0,"To say I hated this seems a bit cruel - so I'll say I really didn't like it ---- Corbin Bernson really hammed it up - I think they call it ""chewing up the scenery"" in the theatre - def over-acted to the point where you just had to roll your eyes... A LOT!! The mom over sold her role as well - the two kids were the best actors - everyone else just stunk up the screen. Pretty bad special effects and a slow story. I'd rather watch paint dry than to sit through this again.",1520726400,,473,3.88659793814433
