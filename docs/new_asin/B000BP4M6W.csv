8090417,4,B000BP4M6W,A very good video showing some great tips when running the 2-3 match-up zone. I would have liked to see more game action examples.,1323561600,,130,4.458333333333333
8090418,5,B000BP4M6W,This is an excellent dvd that explains many different philosophies of the 2-3 zone defense. the first time I watched this DVD was just to watch it and see what he had to say. I did not like it at all. A month later I had to watch it again because our head coach said we were going to start playing more 2-3 zone. This time I watched it again with the intent to learn and had quite a different experience. I found it very informative. The more I watched it the more I liked it and understood it. Now I would highly recomend it.,1308009600,,526,4.019047619047619
8090419,2,B000BP4M6W,"It wasn't a bad video but for 40$ it could have had better production value, Video examples of strategies ect.  I was kinda dissapointed it seemed like he gave a last second, free seminar and they video taped it and sold it.  There are better videos out there and I'm a huge Syracuse and Jimmy B fan so it's hard for him to dissapoint me.",1247097600,4,338,4.184615384615385
