8413057,1,6305564752,"Even ABC and Oprah have distanced themselves from this 'documentary' that was put out by ABC's entertainment division in 1997. On January 12, 2007, ABC's own program, 20/20, revealed evidence that Anthony Godby Johnson (the young boy dying of AIDS in ""About Us: The Dignity of Children"") was a fictional creation. One of the shows producers, Leslie Karsten, appeared to have contributed to the cover up of the fictional character of Anthony Godby Johnson by making the following reference to Anthony when questioned about the veracity of his existence,  ""I am Momma, and he is the gift of my life."" How ABC could have permitted the cast list to include the voice of Anthony Godby Johnson who a voice analysis expert identified to be that of Vicki Johnson, a woman who claimed to be his adoptive mother, is baffling.
The Wall Street Journal printed a review of ""About Us: The Dignity of Children"", by Barbara D. Phillips, that noted there were 8 pages of press material for a 19 page dialogue script. The press material includes a producer statement that says ""We felt that the emotional journey through childhood, unique to everyone, makes us all experts on the subject."" This ABC documentary can best be summed up by Barbara D. Phillips observation about the producers devoting  screen time to ""adults nursing childhood grievances"". The only thing worthwhile thing about this production is the writer, Laura Cunningham's ruminations about her childhood from her book, ""Sleeping Arrangements"".",1203033600,5,1493,5.089795918367347
8413058,5,6305564752,"This is a great video for children, and adults. It talks a little bit about everything. From being afraid, teassed, abused,and just being themselves. I really liked the beginning when one of my favorite authors Anthony Godby-Johnson who wrote the book A Rock and a Hard Place. Talked about what it's like to be a child, and how they feel. Then in the middle of the movie he comes back and talks a little bit about his story. How he was abused,rescued,and later finding out that he has A.I.D.S.. Oprah also talks about what it was like as a child.",989625600,2,546,4.47
