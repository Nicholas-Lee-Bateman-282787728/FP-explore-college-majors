The photography is excellent, and we noticed there seemed to be an avoidance of modern day construction, thus showing the landscape as it has been for years, liked that. We would recommend it to anyone interested.",1387584000,,367,5.133333333333334

This is one of the DVD sets I chose. People like to watch movies about places they either plan to visit or wish they could visit, including national monuments. I want to see these DVDs myself!",1225238400,,369,4.522388059701493
