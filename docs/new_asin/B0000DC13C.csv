8000492,5,B0000DC13C,"EL MAR DE LUCAS (Lucas' Sea) is a beautifully constructed Argentinean film conceived, written, directed and starring Victor Laplace.  The story deals with issues that are the results of the influences of families broken by divorce. In keeping the story simple and honest, the concept of men accepting their responsibility and vulnerability after leaving a young family to 'see the world' is, in Laplace's hands, a very moving and powerful statement without even coming close to banal!
As the story opens in Buenos Aires, Juan (Laplace) is celebrating his 50th birthday by graciously cooking individual personal favorite dishes for his fiends, the patrons of his restaurant. It seems there is nothing this generous man will not do for his confreres. A young woman (Manuela - in a role that indicates the star power of Virginia Innocentti) appears with a 2 1/2 year old boy (Lucas) and announces that Lucas is Juan's Grandson.  Taken by surprise that he has a grandson when he has had little contact with his son Fecundo (Pablo Rago), this newly discovered extended family  sets the story in motion. His son and family seem to have been less important to Juan than his own self-centered, though beneficent, life.  Now he heads off to The Wisterias in a stolen bus where he slowly gains acceptance into his son's life, discovering the joys of fatherhood and grandfather hood and making up for his self-imposed distance by aiding his son in realizing his dream - a 'sea' (lake) resort in the wilds of Argentina which will not only serve as a living for the son and his family but also for the tender little town of The Wisterias which adores their champion.  There is a coming together with Juan and his ex-wife (Ana Maria Picchio) and through capers both funny and tender the family unit finds restoration in more ways than one.  At the end of the film the 'sea' named for the grandson Lucas promises to become a reality.
This sensitive, very touching film that has many philosophical lessons about family and progeny.  A warm film to lighten your life a bit!",1081123200,3,2056,4.807365439093484
