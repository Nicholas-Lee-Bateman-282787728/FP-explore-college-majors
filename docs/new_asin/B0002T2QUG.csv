8031466,5,B0002T2QUG,"We already have the other versions of Harold so I ordered this to see what all the fuss about the difference was. There is a difference but my kids, 7 months 3yrs and 6yrs, love it just the same. My oldest isn't into the other stories as much but my 3 yr old likes them so whatever. It was a stroll down memory lane to watch the older stories with my kids that I remember watching as a child. There is a clear difference from the hbo version but we all still enjoy Harold so it's great. Item came on time with other items and kids had fun opening their own mail and getting a suprise.",1394323200,,584,4.043103448275862
8031467,5,B0002T2QUG,I got this collection for the Corduroy movie which I had on VHS but wanted on DVD.  I have always loved that movie and have never shown it to any 3 or 4 year old that didn't love it.  The Scholastic videos are the best.,1360886400,2,219,3.8444444444444446
8031468,5,B0002T2QUG,"this was a great collection. My 3 yeard old son loved all the different stories on each DVD, not just the main one. Now he wants to read the books.",1280361600,,147,3.933333333333333
8031469,4,B0002T2QUG,"We received this as a gift for Christmas. Our daughter loves them all, but I'm surprised no one mentioned that the Corduroy story is the only one that is not a cartoon. I thought it was very well cast and well presented with real actors in a real department store, but would have preferred the story cartoon version. The story was also changed a bit, thought the plot stayed the same. Otherwise all the other stories are excellent. As a teacher, I love that these storybooks were made into videos!",1262476800,2,497,4.533333333333333
8031470,5,B0002T2QUG,"We love the Scholastic Video Collections!!  Our first collection included the story ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"".  My two year old son doesn't ask to watch a movie or television.  He asks for ""Boom Boom""!  He especially loves the stories that are put to music or song.

The Scholastic Video Collection is a series that every household with babies, toddlers and preschool age children should have.  They are good, clean, educational fun.",1169078400,4,433,5.028169014084507
8031471,5,B0002T2QUG,"What a great idea! The books you love from your childhood are here, in DVD format for you to share with your child (or classroom). We use these in our home as pre-bedtime videos on occasion. Our favorite is the ""Harold"" DVD. You could look these titles up on your own for a full video listing, but I thought I'd help out and make your life a little bit easier. Included titles are as follows:

""Harold and the Purple Crayon"": Harold and the Purple Crayon, A Picture for Harold's Room, Harold's Fairy Tale, The Mysterious Tadpole, Drummer Hoff, Smile for Auntie

""Corduroy"": Corduroy, Yo! Yes?, Here Comes the Cat, The Rainbabies

""The Snowy Day"": The Snowy Day, Whistle for Willie, Peter's Chair, Pet Show!, A Letter to Amy, The Trip, Apt. 3 (Also included in this DVD is ""Getting to Know Ezra Jack Keats"")

Hope this helps! Sound quality and story flow is great. My 2-year-old just loves these!",1134259200,13,895,4.610062893081761
