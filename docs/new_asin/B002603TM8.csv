8500756,5,B002603TM8,"This dvd is really well done foundational video for soccer skills.  My U9 rec player could follow it without it patronizing him, but also without leaving him in the dust.  Lots of individual drills and well as small group drills for 2 or 3 kids. The sort of thing that a parent can work on with their kids, leaving their rec team coaches to focus on team play and game tactics.

The main focus is on ball control, all the way from the different surfaces of the foot and contact areas with the ball for different passing and shooting effects, to basic dribbling and body movement.  It is organized into small chapters that can be accessed from the menu, so that you can easily go back to 1 or 2 drills before you go out to the park with your bag of balls.

The kids in the video look like U10s, with a mixture of girls and boys.  The on screen coach was an Australian international, and Ajax player (Dutch team that regularly appears in UEFA Champions League).

If your child has these fundamentals mastered, look for something more advanced on tricks and tactics.",1351900800,,1063,4.448453608247423
