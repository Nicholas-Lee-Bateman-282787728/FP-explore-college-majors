154706,3,0792844734,"Julien Temple's colorful and tuneful tribute to England's pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll scene looks a little better as it ages. ""Absolute Beginners"" opens with promise...an impressive ""Touch Of Evil"" tracking shot capturing the energy of London's youth culture/nightclub scene on a hot summer night circa 1960. From that point on, however, the director runs into trouble with narrative (a common problem for many MTV wunderkinds who jumped directly from 5-minute videos to the big screen in the 80's). Temple does have a great visual style, and the proceedings tend to perk up during the production numbers, particularly when sultry Sade and hammy David Bowie are onscreen. A number featuring Ray Davies perfectly encapsulates the zeitgeist of all those classic Kinks odes to British middle-class life. The plot may have been inspired by the virtually unknown (but quite ahead of its time) 1960 British classic ""Expresso Bongo"", which took a cynical look at the manufactured pop star machine. The movie's final third, with a convoluted subplot about a racist real estate developer, doesn't fit the rest of the story and brings everything to a grinding halt with too much noisy, confusing bombast. Still, the eye-catching sets, memorable musical numbers and musician cameos makes this one worth a look.",987984000,3,1297,5.270531400966184
154707,5,0792844734,"When you watch the opening sequence from ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, the first thought that might come to your mind is that it's shot a lot like Janet Jackson's ""When I Think of You"" video.  There is a reason for that -- they were both directed by Julien Temple.  His background as one of the top music video directors comes to good use here.  All of the musical sequences are superbly staged and choreographed.  As an added benefit, you get a rare chance to see both Sade and R&B pioneer Slim Gaillard perform in a motion picture.  Sade is absolutely stunning as she sings ""Killer Blow,"" a song which she also co-wrote.  The soundtrack is filled with other great songs including Slim Gaillard's ""Selling Out,"" ""Having it All"" (performed by Patsy Kensit), ""That's Motivation"" and the title cut.  The latter two songs were performed by David Bowie.  In terms of plot, the makers of the film took a big chance by going beyond the basic boy-meets-girl story found in most classic musicals.  The romance is still there, but it also attempts to deal with some serious social issues, including the gentrification of a community.  For the most part the film succeeds in its somewhat lofty ambitions.  Overall, the cast gives credible, if somewhat broad performances, but this is to be expected within the musical genre.  An initial hurdle for American audiences will be to decipher the thick British accents.  However, with the second viewing that shouldn't be a problem, particularly given the fact that this release comes closed captioned.  Thank God for closed captioning!  I previously purchased the earlier, non-captioned version, but because the film has been so popular with my friends, I had no choice, but to buy a second copy.  You know how it is when you loan things, sometimes it takes a l-o-n-g time to get things back -- especially with a movie as entertaining as this one.  Rather than keep waiting, I simply purchased another copy (now with closed captioning) and I'm so glad I did.  If you're looking for a musical with something on it's mind, you need to look no further.  You will also be hard pressed to find a musical as visually stunning as this one with great music to match.  This all for just a bit more than the price of a movie ticket.  In short, ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS is an absolute must see.",973641600,10,2302,4.719298245614035

I love this movie for its 80's attempt at portraying 50's West London.  As I  am originally from West London I found this a great nostalgia trip.  The  two leading characters are not very well played but Patsy Kemsit looks as  wonderful as ever.  The musical numbers are great - especially the Ray  Davies piece and the Selling Out routine. Julian Temples' background in  video is obvious throughout the movie and makes for some very original and  striking images.

Needless to say, ""A.B""  is chock-full of 80's music stars, & the colors & editing are  fabulous.  There are some sequences in this film that should be required  viewing for film students. The opening 10 minutes is the longest  uninterrupted, uncut sequence in modern film & it's complexity is  staggering. The musical number ""Selling Out"" will leave you  gasping at it's audaciousness. The set-piece ""A Quiet House""  featuring Ray Davies (the Kinks) could be a music video in it's own right.

154738,4,0792844734,"I saw this film in its initial theatrical release in 1986, and enjoyed it quite a bit. For the most part, it holds up many years later. It is an extraordinarily flamboyant musical, and in explosively stylized musical numbers conveys the birth of rock 'n roll/mod culture in London. It is very imaginative. James Fox is a pleasure to watch as always as a corrupt, powerful fashion designer and David Bowie does a really wild musical number as an advertising man amped up on his own energy. The lovely Patsy Kensit is perfectly cast as Crepe Suzette, the seemingly carefree yet quite practical beauty who is desired by everybody. This movie is based on the Colin Mac Innes novel of the same title ( it was published in 1959; it's part of his London Trilogy ).

154740,4,0792844734,"Absolute Beginners was released in 1986, but it harkens back to those halcyon days of 1958, when England was shaking off its drab shades of grey, gray, and greyer, and embracing more vibrant colors and the power of youth. The Musical is based on the novel of the same name by Colin MacInnes. Colin is also the name of the photographer/narrator (Eddie O'Connell), who is the protagonist. As the film opens, he explains in voice-over his ambition to capture the ethereal blossoms on film before they wither or are rendered in plastic.

This film was an attempt to capture the ethereal blossoms, too, but too late--it was more of a rendering in plastic. Not that this musical is without charm, it is loaded with it--but it tries to tackle several serious issues but ends up biting off more than it can chew.

In some ways it is like West Side Story, with its theme of racial tension among youth gangs, but the music is a mish mash of various styles, all likeable enough, but failing to coalesce into a single unified vision, as it did with Leonard Bernstein & Stephen Sondheim. This film actually has Gil Evans, whose work with Miles Davis stands out, but here his talents are wasted. I imagine that is his arrangement of Charles Mingus' Boogie Stop Shuffle, and Better Git it in Your Soul, but they don't really add anything to the original. We also have a great dance number with Colin and the sinister Vendice Partners (David Bowie) tap-dancing on a giant type writer, and a charming ditty sung by Arthur, Collin's dad (Ray Davies). Did I mention the dance number where Suzette (Patsy Kensit) takes over the fashion runway, or where she sings in Chez Nobody a la Miss Peggy Lee's Fever, to the accompaniment of finger snaps? There is also a great party sequence featuring Slim Gaillard of Slim & Slam fame (Fast Foot Floogie with the Floy Floy) and another club sequence where Sade sings. In the party sequence Dido Lament, Gossip Columnist (Anita Morris) straps a cocktail shaker onto her high heel, hops on the bar, and mixes a martini with her leg while lounging on her back. I was not only shaken, but also stirred.

After West Side Story, I would compare the musical Absolute Beginners to Clockwork Orange, but that film used its music--Beethoven and other classical numbers--in a much more innovative way that supported the story, the action, and was the one redeeming quality of its teen age thug protagonist, Alexander De Large.

If this movie had been done with Paul Weller of The Jam, I think we would have had a much more interesting film experience. He was inspired by the book, Absolute Beginners, to write a song with that title. Even though he belongs more to the 80's, when the film was made, then the late 50's, the period it tries to capture, his music was retro, nostalgic for the days of The Who, and also the soul and R&B that would support the theme of racial tension.

The director, Julien Temple, also directed The Great Rock & Roll Swindle, along with a lot of videos and music-related projects. There is a song here by Tenpole Tudor, as Ed the Ted, that doesn't really relate to the rest of the story, but like his song in Swindle, is charming nonetheless. Not being up on English teen culture as much as I thought I was, weren't there riots between Teds and Mods, or Mods and Rockers? Ringo Starr was asked if he was a Mod or a Rocker, and he said he was a Mocker. In this film there is a stand off between Mods and Trads. Modern Jazz versus Trad Jazz? Who knew the Brits took that so serious.

To me it was interesting to see James Fox in his role as Henley of Mayfair, Dressmaker to the Queen. I wondered what had happened to him. Fox dropped out of the acting profession for nine years (1970-79) after he filmed Performance (1970) with Mick Jagger. A combination of his father's recent death, the strain of filming and smoking the hallucinogen DMT with Mick Jagger led to a nervous breakdown. Fox subsequently joined a religious organization known as ""The Navigators"" which is similar to the Gideons and is closely associated with the ministry of Billy Graham. He published a book, ""Comeback: An Actor's Direction"", in 1983.

[On his 9-year break from acting]: People think Performance (1970) blew my mind... my mind was blown long before that.

Performance (1970) gave me doubts about my way of life. Before that I had been completely involved in the more bawdy side of the film business. But after that everything changed.

To sum it up: This movie is a musical adaptation of the book Absolute Beginners set in 1958. The themes are the emerging youth explosion, the baby boom, and its cultural ramifications. The creativity and energy of youth is co-opted, exploited, and used to sell useless products. The low rent ghetto, haven for artists and other demimondes, is torn down by greedy developers to make way for housing projects, and neo-fascist thugs are used to threaten and harass the inhabitants into moving. These are serious subjects, but then, the fights are all choreographed into dance numbers, making the whole thing seem very silly and trivial. But this is a musical, so what are you going to do? two, three, four, and jazz hands!

154741,2,0792844734,"With my new desire to get back to the unknown, I decided to start at the beginning with a little musical that I heard nothing about, never once caught a tune from a song, nor would think most mainstream video stores will carry.  ""Absolute Beginners"" was a MTV promotion that was initially destined to be one of the biggest box office films of the year.  It was a film for the younger generation, a multi-time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in Britain and how these troubled, constantly hitting each note, teen's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow.  It could have been dubbed the ""Moulin Rouge"" of the 80s, but it disappeared.  It made its very shallow mark on the world, snuck under the radar, and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section, the comedy section, or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn't need chain money to survive.  Alas, that wasn't where I found it - but I found it, watched it, tried my hardest to sing along with it, stared into Bowie's eyes, but found myself faded by the end.  Did it not survive the test of time?  Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society?  Is Bowie too creepy?  I think ""Absolute Beginners"" falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang, but withers to a mere sparkle by the end.

""Absolute Beginners"" opens with a huge number that takes us through the non-gritty streets of London which involve theft nightly, prostitutes on every corner, dance throughout, booze like rivers, and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual.  Sounds like a place we would all hate to be ... right?  Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters.  The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie O'Connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl, Suzette (played by Patsy Kensit).  These two have chemistry, and while Suzette looks like a pre-rehab Lohan, to me they worked.  There was a huge spark between them, the chemistry was like lava, and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled.  I was ready - but then, something happened.  Temple takes us out of the nightlife, takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning, and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first.  Suzette runs away, Colin becomes a pervert, and Bowie ... well ... I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain - I can tell you that much.  Temple gives us this flashy city, this opportunity to see those that inhabit it, but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger.  We learn about Colin, mainly, but nobody else.  I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom, and what importance fashion had to that era.  Also, were they teens really - they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s, but maybe it was my TV.

Character development thrown right out the door, Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger, more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about.  One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example.  Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colin's parents (of which I didn't know it was them until after the film) and a song which screams apathy.  Great song, too many characters, not enough time, suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency, and it just falls apart in your hands.  Then, if that wasn't enough, we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs, rubbing our noggin' trying to understand where our characters are or are going, and Temple throws in hatred, anger, and politics into the final act.  While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme, I didn't think racism would be on the top of the bill.  Suddenly, friends are missing, people are angry, and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race?  Somebody help me out here.  It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming - nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off.  To me, the ending of ""Absolute Beginners"" was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number.  That first part set the pace, and Temple could not keep up.

Overall, I must say that Temple can direct a music video, but I don't think he was quite prepared for the feature film.  I don't think this film will ever make it into full ""cult"" status, and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come.  It is a fun film to watch initially, but when we get to that final part, it just explodes from the inside.  I wanted some cutting edge work, but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for.  I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s, but by the end it just felt forced.  I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to ""Motivation"" by the ever-freaky Bowie in this film, it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status.  I am glad that I watched this film once, but that is all that my small brain can take.  I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning, but he couldn't control his characters (way too many), and the songs didn't seem to match the final moments of the film.  It came out of nowhere, and it was unwelcomed.  If this was a film about racism, it needed to be from the beginning.  ""Absolute Beginners"" was a welcomed adventure, but I don't think I will be dusting this film off in the future.

154762,3,0792844734,"One of the things I loved about this movie was the set design and costumes, all in spectacular colors. However, the color in this MGM-released DVD wobbles from vivid to washed-out and back to vivid, often during the same scene. Pretty disappointing -- what I might expect from a 2nd-generation VHS copy, but not a DVD.",1180915200,4,318,4.696428571428571
154763,4,0792844734,"This year I had the opportunity to read both Absolute Beginners and City of Spades, both by Colin MacInnes. Both deal with racial tension in London. I was surprized to find this DVD where the novel Absolute Beginners had been made into a film. I was even more surprized when I watched this ambitious, slightly flawed, but creative brave product.

Eddie O'Connell and Patshy Kensit are beautiful as Colin the 19 year old photographer, and Crepe Suzette, his dress designer girlfriend. Both have superb dance numbers.

The art direction was exceptional with some of the most creative sets to be seen in years on the screen. It appeared that Kenny Scharf and Rodney Allen Greenblatt had designed all the club interiors in the film. The costumes were over the top. The choreography was exceptional since it had to convey the chaos and violence of race riots in dance form. It reminded me of the gang fight scenes in West Side Story, only more violent and less stylized.

David Bowie plays both a dramatic role and sings one of the songs in this musical. Sade however takes the prize with ""Killer Blow"" sung in a nightclub. The scene of Sade singing is worth the price of the DVD. Other bands play in the film, including Fine Young Cannibals. Ray Davies (looking very good) of the Kinks plays Colin's father, a content and handsome middle aged man with a nympho wife who has sex with the male boarders in their boarding house.

The film is a conglomeration of diverse influences from various times and eras. From West Side Story to the work of Charles Mingus, you will find great entertainment watching the various iterations of these influences flow across the screen.

Yet, underlying the vast visual and musical display is a subplot about racial tension and disruption. The film conveys the message that a lively mixture of influences from a range of human cultures stimulates and enlivens the human soul. Likewise, efforts to suppress and destroy others because of race, ethnicity, and religion is counterproductive and damaging in the long run to the human condition.",1167955200,2,2067,4.8441926345609065
154764,4,0792844734,"I've had the soundtrack to this movie for years, the double album no less.  It is an absolute masterpiece.  The movie is a bit of a let down after finally seeing it.  If you think of this movie as a series of interconnecting vignettes it works much better as the plot is very convoluted and meandering.
The final riot seems out of place, but is very effective with our hero caught in the middle of a race riot, running from both the neo-nazis and the angry blacks, having no safe place to go.  Jerry Dammer's music during the whole episode is outstanding.
In the end there is some substance with it's strong anti-capitalist message and even more style with the series of music videos, but empty nonetheless.
David Bowie is the class of the field here.  Sleek, stylish and somehow menacing.
James Fox is understated and uncaring as the greedy heavy.  Everyone else is a step below.  Many over-act or just don't have the chops.
There are a number of pretty standard ""characters"".  There's the hip beatnik type with the always-hip sunglasses, the good-natured gay ""Oscar Wilde"" type with the always-hip sunglasses and the ultra cool black trumpet player (not a sax?) with the always-hip sunglasses.  There is also a street urchin type who's lust for money, it turns out, hides a darker side and a good natured, busty, and big boned lesbian pseudo mother type.
All businessmen & women are portrayed as corrupt bungling money-grubbing capitalists, who are intent on turning the hero's poor tenement neighborhood into an ultramodern ""white"" housing project.
The show business types are fake, toupee wearing liars.  Come to think of it, in my limited experience that's not far from the truth.
There's even an old schoolmaster type who seems completely lost (surprise, surprise).
Many of the actors and artists have a problem keeping up with the words during their lip-syncing (though Bowie makes it look effortless).  You'd think in a major motion picture there would be more of an effort to make that work.
Of course the real star of the movie is the music and the standouts are Gil Evans, the aforementioned Jerry Dammers and David Bowie.  Honorable mentions go to Working Week (Rodrigo Bay doesn't get much airtime but is an exhilarating song) and Style Council reworking their ""With Everything to Lose"" as ""Have You Ever Had It Blue"" with added horns and Latin beats (though it seems out of place here). Slim Gaillard's ""Selling Out"" Clive Langer's ""Napoli"" Smiley Culture's ""So What?"" all work wonders with or without the movie.",1088208000,3,2526,4.862470862470863

You'll watch the film and think it looks really neat, but you won't care for the characters. A few months after this film was released, Spike Lee had a hit with something called ""Do the right thing"". Spike's film is almost a copy of this, same plotline, same issues, but no music. Both films cover a hot summer heatwave where peoples tempers are on edge, race riots occur, etc etc. Why Spike got more attention, I'm not quite sure.",1079654400,,695,4.612903225806452
154766,4,0792844734,"There's a movie musical somewhere in David Bowie's talent, but I'm not sure this is it.  Don't be deceived by the cover, David's only a minor bit in this.
The sets and lights are spectacular here, and the music's pretty good.  I like the Sade song.  Some of the British accent's a bit hard to catch, (I turned on the captions for the ""Ted's not Dead"" song)
Disappointing extras, and not even a copy of the film's preview. I'm never really partial to slide shows of promotional photos.
I think this film just came out at a time when musicals weren't popular.  It probably would have fared better if released today.  I'm sure some Broadway producer will be ... over it soon, given their proclivity to turn movies and TV shows into Broadway musicals.",1053216000,5,747,4.544776119402985
154767,5,0792844734,"""I remember that hot wonderful summer, when the teenage miracle reached full bloom, and everyone in England stopped what they were doing to stare at what had happened.""--opening narration
I also remember the number of times I tuned into MTV for David Bowie's video, which included clips from that movie.  I finally saw it on TV and I was blown away.
Colin is the main character and narrator of this story.  It's the long hot summer of 1958.  Rationing was over, and Britain was rebuilt, thanks to the Marshall Plan--now it was time for Britain to have fun with their own pop culture explosion.  Colin has a lot of colourful friends.  There's Wizard, pickpocket and entrepreneur out for a fast pound, Cool, the African trumpet player, the flamboyant Fabulous Hotlife, described as ""our own Oscar Wilde,"" Dean Swift, ""a modern jazz creation,"" and Big Jill, a hefty but friendly lesbian.  And yes, there's the luscious Suzette, Colin's love interest, whose wanting to make it to the fashion big-time causes a rift between them.
Suzette does make it big, attracting the attention of her boss, Henley of Mayfair (James Fox).  She comes onstage in a daring glittering black mini, and does the hot jazz number ""Va Va Voom"" with some African dancers.
Colin spends time taking snaps at the neon glitter and sights of the London nightlife, but doesn't want to go mainstream.  ""It's not that I've got anything against money.  It's just what you have to do to get it.""  He eventually does pictures for Harry Charms (Lionel Blair), an oily talent searcher and agent with a penchant for young boys.  It's actually gratifying when his protege Baby Boom shoves a microphone full force in his happy sacks.  And I don't know if anyone noticed, but early in the movie, BB's the schoolboy who ends up picking up Charms' card that Colin throws away.  It took me a while to finally realize.
Kinks frontman Ray Davies plays Colin's father, a man who lives with his ""pre-war photo albums and sad memories.""  Colin's half-brother Vern is a disgusting, barely human cretin.  And his mother (Mandy Rice-Davies of Christine Keeler fame), disillusioned with life, has affairs with the numerous lodgers.  The cutaway tenement for the ""Quiet Life"" number is a brilliant touch, as is the chaos going on in there.
David Bowie has only a small role as Vendice Partners, that seller of dreams, but his musical number ""That's Motivation,"" where he successfully tempts Colin into selling out has a wowser of a set including giant typewriters, a globes with an airplane attached at the equator, an Everest mockup marketing frozen vegetables, and a floor painted to look like a giant 78 record.
Speaking of musicians, Sade doesn't look out of place singing ""Killer Blow.""  She's simply exquisite!
Patsy Kensit is so much more ravishing here than she ever was before she went on to Lethal Weapon 2 and Angels And Insects.  Eve Ferrett is wonderful as the bubbly Big Jill.
Notable cameos include Steven Berkoff (Clockwork Orange, Beverly Hills Cop) as a Neo-Nazi fanatic presumably modelled after Enoch Powell, Colin Jeavons (House of Cards) as the fanatic's pamphleteer, Julian Firth (Brother Jerome in the Cadfael series) is the Misery Kid, dressed in the skeleton suit, and Robbie Coltrane (Krull, Harry Potter) as Mario the store owner.
The hot swing jazz sets the pace of the movie, replicating a slice of England sadly long gone.  A real blast of a movie.",1028678400,23,3420,4.875647668393782
154768,5,0792844734,"This is a very visually captivating film based on the fervent and poetic novel by Colin MacInnes. The film creates a surreal world where teenagers frolic in a frenzied London in the late 50's jazz based existence, paralleling outlandishly produced 80s music videos. I love it. Directed by Julien Temple we see corruption of youth by the inevitable commercialization of them by the parasitical establishment in this stylized parable of a generation in evolution. Patsy Kensit is pretty to look and with a name to match as Crepe Suzette.",1026432000,3,535,5.022471910112359
154769,5,0792844734,"Hip photographer, Colin, searches 50's London for latest teen sensations, and finds exploitation, sex, music, disillusionment, loose-morals, fashion and Teds. Great performances from David Bowie as a mid-Atlantic entrepreneur Vendice Partners, Patsy Kensit as the irrepressible Suzette, Lionel Blair, James Fox, an evil Steven Berkoff, soulful Sade, and koolest of Kool Tony Hippolyte. A fantastic Anita Morris, and a near-Oscar-winning Eddie O'Connell leads as Colin. Cameos by Tenpole Tudor, Alan Freeman, Eric Sykes, Robbie Coltrane, Ray Davies and Mandy Rice Davies keep your eyes guessing. The film descends into early racist confrontations with scary results. A must-see-film for contemporary musical lovers! Music from David Bowie (of course), Sade, Style Council, Ray Davies and Eighth Wonder, with Slim Gaillard's brilliant ""Selling Out"".

154770,4,0792844734,"With the likes of Moulin Rouge making an impact in the current film scene, one can't help but look back to another lavish attempt at the musical in the 80s - Julien Temple's overlooked ""Absolute Beginners.""
I watched this in glorious 70 mm and like watching Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge - this was a visual tour-de-force.
The critics didn't like it however, which was a shame.  Forget the plot, and the story, but enjoy the ride.  That's what it's all about.  This was a really inventive and slick piece of work.  Heck, Julien's other (& lesser) music video work like ""Blue Jean"" with David Bowie got more attention, and I wonder why.
Well worth watching but as someone puts it below, it really should be letterboxed and on DVD.  Video just doesn't do the scale of the vision much justice at all.  Or perhaps we will see a re-release someday in the theatres.  But that's wishful thinking...",1002758400,4,889,4.624203821656051
154771,4,0792844734,"I've owned my VHS copy of this movie for many, many years.  It is well worn, and I am eagerly awaiting its DVD debut.
Despite what many critics may say, this is an awesome movie/musical.  It's kind of like ""The Music Man"" meets ""Quadrophenia"" meets ""Streets of Fire.""  Very cool indeed.
Story involves the emergence of Soho in the very early 1960's.  The whole Mod scene was just catching on and times were about to get very interesting, as the whole Northern Soul and R&B sound was about to explode.  Features an awesome David Bowie, and, as always, the dazzling (despite being somewhat talent-hungry) Patsy Kensit.  Add to this, an impeccable soundtrack.
I recall that when it came out, I first got the soundtrack lp just for the Vespa on the front. (Since I collect them, as well as Lambrettas).  Then, I flipped the lp over and saw the features.  Three words sealed the deal for me:  ""The Style Council.""  Paul Weller and Mick Talbot are still among my personal idols.
Get this movie.  It's very good and I know you won't regret it. Also get for ""Quadrophenia"" featuring very young ""bell-boy"" Sting.  It too captures the mod scene very well, and the clashes with greasers and the infamous ""Rumble in Brighton"" of which Sezter (a la the Stray Cats) sang.
Also, check out ""Streets of Fire"" and ""Something Wild.""  Particularly the latter has an INCREDIBLE soundtrack.",993513600,6,1368,4.7215189873417724

7792489,4,0792844734,"You can tell that Temple got his start in music videos; this is a very visually appealing movie, but only a marginally satisfying character study. Mainly, it's just a lot of fun to watch, even though he doesn't ever really fully invest himself in any of the several story lines. Like ""Velvet Goldmine"" and ""Backbeat"" which came out at roughly the same time, but were both better at story-telling, if you are interested in various time frames of British pop music, and the surrounding social currents, you should enjoy this. Bowie, Sade, Tenpole Tudor, and Ray Davies all have roles, and the music is a blast, especially Slim Gaillard's ""Selling Out"" and Sade's ""Killer Blow.""",1487894400,,675,4.878260869565217
