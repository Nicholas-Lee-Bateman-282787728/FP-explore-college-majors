it is narrated by Lucy Lawless and is well done. It's forty five minutes long and this company prints their products on dvdr's for some reason. That is a minus but the show is a good one about saint joan. And what a incredible , tragic and herioc and even awful life she lived. This made me realize how brave and incredibly strong willed she was. She really believed in herself and her times were so nightmarish that it's inspiring how she even attemped to do what she did. She was only a kid and yet few would ever claim to be as brave as she was. Her rape and hideous death by being burned alive are only part of the story. The king she served was not a good man by any means of the word imo, Still the photography is good here and they do some recreations. So this is NO movie , it's good though.",1326326400,4,908,4.135593220338983
