1809717,5,B00007GDKA,I really liked this video. Its not a workout tape like neena and veena's its a dance tape that teaches a routine. Its fun and not too hard to learn.,1071532800,,148,3.966666666666667
1809718,5,B00007GDKA,"This is a choreography by Amira Mor. It is volume 2 of her series and geared towards intermediate students. Very lovely dancing. The choreography is the same style of dancing as in her performance video ""Behind the Veil"". This is not one of those videos that the instructor teaches one way but dances much differently leaving you with the feeling that she cheated you out of a quality dance insruction and kept her true technique a secret. If you love her dancing, then you will love this video. Beginners should start out with ""Bellydance your way to Fitness"".",1047945600,5,561,4.73469387755102
7976302,4,B00007GDKA,"If your looking for a way to just exercise then this is for you, if your looking to learn more belly dance moves not so much..",1378944000,,126,3.8846153846153846
7976303,5,B00007GDKA,"She offers a lot of information in this video that will be used in her advanced performances.  The dance is very pleasant to watch, sufficiently aerobic, and the setting allows the student to look forward to the days ahead when she will perform in a setting other than the studio.",1322438400,,280,4.6
7976304,4,B00007GDKA,"This lady knows how to move, if you are just starting in bellydance

and want good style and workout this is for you, no fancy set up, just good dance.",1172275200,2,151,4.033333333333333
7976305,5,B00007GDKA,"I love this video, and the choreography is enjoyable. Amira Mor teaches at a pace fast enough to keep you on your toes , but slow enough to remember the choreography. The music, ""Habibi"", is catchy and energetic. Amira Mor teaches moves such as the ""Sphinx"", which is similar to fast zar head movements, and the pelvic shimmy. She also has a little bit of shimmy layering in the choreography. I would not recommend this video to someone with no knowledge of belly dance, or someone just beginning to learn the basics because of these movements. It is great for someone who has had some belly dance experience. Amira Mor's techniques are flawless, and I liked the way the choreography changed pace. The scenery is not so much the issue as the moves, and the way Amira Mor breaks them down. I believe she does a great job of doing this. Personally, I plan to always refer back to this video for practice.",1140480000,,902,4.539877300613497
7976306,5,B00007GDKA,"I have always admired the Amira Mor videos - she is a very good teacher! Clear and concise, she shows each move in slow motion & explains it before moving it up to tempo. Her ""Bellydancing for Fitness"" DVD is a more basic one, & you should start with that. This one assumes you know a few bellydancing moves before you've begun, so if you don't know how to bellydance, it could be a bit too challenging. I liked this video & enjoy her teaching style as her belly dancing.",1132617600,,471,4.2444444444444445
7976307,2,B00007GDKA,"I like instructionals that mock the class setting, so you can see more than just the instructor perform a movement- helps you to figure out whether or not you are doing it correctly sometimes.  She is a little cheesy in her introduction and starts moving off beat towards the end of her performance, plus the other girls are off sync probably due to that... that is distracting.  But it is still fun to dance along.  Let's face it- most bellydance videos are fun.  So try to see past the cheesiness of the plastered on smiles and try not to peek into the window of the neighbor's bedroom window visible over the backyard fence behind the dancers, don't pay too much attention to the plaster Grecian statues that litter the pool deck, or the algae accumulating on the plaster of the pool... just dance and have fun- that is the only way to enjoy this video.",1127174400,2,856,4.503225806451613
7976308,5,B00007GDKA,"In my opinion Amira Mor is an awesome belly dancer. I not have only watched her videos but also have been taking classes with her for the past 2 years. I have tried a lot of workshops with different teachers and Amira is absolutely the best. I highly recommend buying her videos since they are all exceptional and all very different. Don't let the bad reviews fool you. Amira is everything but a sleazy dancer, she  a gorgeous  woman who definitely knows how to dance. Everyone has a diffrent style of belly dancing  and I definitely prefer hers to any other belly dancer. Try it for your self .....",1110412800,,599,4.477064220183486
7976309,4,B00007GDKA,"Here's what this video does not do:

1. It does not spend a lot of time on individual techniques.

2. It does not teach you to bellydance if you don't know anything about it.

3. It has no warm-up or stretching.

Here's what this video does:

1. Amira Mor presents a choreography to a catchy ME pop tune and breaks down each section of choreography.

2. She describes each move but does not spend a lot of time teaching it or doing it over and over so you can practice it. (That's what pause and rewind are for.) The tape teaches you the dance, not how to perform a walking shimmy.

3. She keeps you moving and goes back to the top of the dance a few times so you can repeat what you've done already.

4. It's not unlike a very fast-paced workshop.

Amira teaches with a number of dancers behind her. During the ""class"" portion they wear coordinated practice-wear, and in the ""performance"" they wear unique bedlah. The filming is all done outside, so the video doesn't suffer from the ""dark as a pit"" trouble that many dance videos have.

Look! A balanced review with no catty remarks in it! It can be done!",1103068800,2,1107,4.330097087378641
7976310,1,B00007GDKA,"Amira Mor is a terrible belly dancer and presents the dance in a very classless and tasteless way. It very sad to see the beautiful art of belly dancing reach such a low point. Belly dancers work very hard at preserving and embellishing their art, not turn it into a bad day at the local Go-Go bar! Amira Mor dances likes a stripper not an Oriental Belly Dancer. Glad I got these DVD's for free and didn't buy them...do yourself a favor and go the real belly dancers.",1093996800,,467,4.318181818181818
7976311,1,B00007GDKA,AMIRA MOR IS NOT AN AUTHENTIC BELLYDANCER. ANYONE CAN PERFORM A STRIPTEASE.  THERE'S NOTHING ARABIC OR TURKISH ABOUT HER MOVEMENTS.  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VOCABULARY REGARDING MOVEMENTS?  DOES SHE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RHYTHMS?  WHAT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS HOW YOUNG SOME OF THESE PERFORMERS ARE.  HER DAUGHTER  IS ONE AND SHE'S NOT EVEN 17 YEARS OLD.,1090972800,5,385,5.112903225806452
