172224,5,0941232131,"As you probably know, the ""Why We Fight"" series was produced by Frank Capra when he was a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The series was commissioned by Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, as a way of indoctrinating all the troops who signed up in the wake of Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war. The idea was to make it clear we were doing more than just remembering Pearl Harbor. Eventually the series was shown to the public in theaters across the country. This introductory film in the ""Why We Fight"" series covers the events leading up to the Second World War, focusing on the rise of Fascism in Italy and Germany, the Japanese attacks on Manchuria, and the United States' lack of military preparedness. The last is particularly interesting because it implicitly explains Pearl Harbor not as a Japanese victory, but rather as an American defeat (we lost rather than they won). ""Prelude to War"" defines World War II in black and white terms as the totalitarian worldwide conspiracy threatens to turn the free world into a slave world. Admittedly a propaganda film, this 1942 documentary is quite informative, explaining about Hitler's book ""Mein Kampf,"" Lebensraum, the Tanaka Plan, the London Naval Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nuremberg Laws, and even such details as the Roman fasces.
This 54-minute black & white film won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1942 and the series as a whole is credited with redefining the documentary as an art form. Of great historical value, it must be underscored that ""Prelude to War"" is not exactly propaganda in the most pejorative sense of the term. The film's great ""sin"" along those lines is that it makes the case that public opinion was moving in the direction of joining the war. Instead of dismissing this film and Capra's efforts as the American counterpart to what Goebbels was doing in Nazi Germany, it is more accurate to think of it as being the film equivalent of a prosecutor's speech in a trial. ""Prelude to War"" makes much better use of evidence without the radical distortion you usually find in classic examples of propaganda.",1082332800,2,2126,4.8273972602739725
172225,2,0941232131,"In short, too much repeat footage.  This DVD pack is sub average at its very best.  The Highlights are the program on the battle with the Africa Corps. and the program on the Battle of the Bulge.  The other 2 programs are made up of repeat footage.  Their are virtually no insights given and the feeling of the entire set is one of an impersonal overview.  And not just any overview but an overview that is rushed, its as if the narrators (there are 2 and they are both inept) need to make a mad dash to the toilet and just want to get this damn thing over with.  If you are looking for something comprehensive and insightful this clunk is a total waste of time.",1067644800,4,662,4.214285714285714

172227,2,0941232131,"I have seen some pretty good productions from the History Channel.  This is not one of them.  It views like a text book, with rapid fire black and white war footage, and facts.  The information is good, however it is difficult to watch as the narrator changes with the footage (which is often).  Do not expect to see much along the way of synopsis or historian commentary / insights as you view this dvd.",1051920000,4,404,4.418918918918919
172228,5,0941232131,"I remember watching in rapt amazement the Canada at War series when it was first shown in the early 1960s. In fact, I remember it being shown to students at my school. My father flew with the RCAF in bomber command and this was an opportunity to explore some of his role in the war. This was the first television series which provided a comprehensive picture of the role of the Canadian military during World War 2. Although not as well known as the World at War series, it is less ""preachy"" and stands the test of time more effectively.
Those people who identify Canadian international participation by its politically correct ""peacekeeping"" role will be surprised by the significant contribution made by that country during the second world war. Two facts: 1. by the end of the war Canada had the 3rd largest navy in the world. 2. Canadians served in all the major theaters of the war.
The music score is wonderfully written and is a highlight of the series. Film clips include scenes from other series as well original footage.
Long after ""The Valor and the Horror"" has been justly assigned to the scrap heap of historical revisionism, the ""Canada at War""
series will justly be remembered as an accurate tribute to Canada's proud contribution to the second world war. A must have for any history enthusiast.",1038268800,4,1310,4.724890829694323

I purchased it, and was glad to see some mention of the Canadians, even used the old union jack the Canadians had as a flag, at first i didn't realize that flag was for the Canadians.
Kind of old, nothing really new here, shocking or really that exciting, kind of boring, magazine subrictions to WII history or WW2 are much more interesting.",1031443200,4,413,4.434210526315789
172230,3,0941232131,"Potential buyers should be made aware that this History Channel presentation dates from the mid 1980s. As such it lacks some of the ""spit and polish"" of more recent THC offerings, but the subject matter and footage are of course much older than that.
Overall it is a decent package considering the amount of material and the price, but I found it somewhat lacking compared with the shows that THC currently produces, which tend to have better narration, better music, much better maps, and a more professional presentation.
Video quality is about as good as one could expect, and the audio is basic and serviceable stereo.",978566400,17,622,4.877358490566038
172231,4,0941232131,"Due to the lack of educational films on WWII, this one is the best to be found. It clearly explains the whole European campaign, with personal photographs from the GI's who were actually there. I think that it is important to know the history of something before you watch a drama on it, so i suggest watching this movie before watching Saving Private Ryan, or The Thin Red Line.",977702400,3,379,4.507246376811594
172232,5,0941232131,"This is an extraordinary film, a must see for anyone who wants to know what World War II in Europe was like.  The film was shot by John Houston's Signal Corps unit.  When the powers that be in the Army saw the film, they  moved to prevent its release.  It was just to vivid in showing what the war  in Italy was like.  And of course, it was completely different than the war  movies Hollywood was churning out.  So the story goes, Houston appealed to  Gen. Geo. Marshall, who ordered it released.  The film covers one battle in  Italy.  All elements are covered, from planning to fighting.  There is none  of the Huns-on-the-run-how-chased-the-Germans-away mentality of many war  movies.  It is a documentary in the finest sense. This shows the gritty  details of war, including the only scenes I have ever seen of the stacking  of dead GIs on to trucks, sewing them into shrouds and burying them, right  on the battlefield.  Houston had his cameramen right up at the front with  the GIs as they advanced.  Houston also shows the battle's effect on the  village of San Pietro.  All through the film, Houston's brilliance as a  director comes out.  While I have not seen the particular video offered  here, if it is the standard version you won't want to miss it.",943488000,13,1262,4.592760180995475

It's a series from the 50s or 60s with lame graphics and commentary.  It has decent real-life video, but I expected so much more for my money.  I'd send it back, but since it is already opened I'm sure they would not accept it.  Plus it's not worth my time and effort.

172238,1,0941232131,"This set of videos was disappointing, especially because the History Channel usually is better.

First, it's not just about the war in Europe, so if you want to focus on the European theater, you're also going to get some about Japan, Asia and Africa. Which means the European focus is weaker.

Second, they use some of the shots and narratives twice. Which is okay if you watch an episode a week, but not if you watch all 4 in a couple of days. The repetition seemed pointless.

The videos also don't give a good feel for plans or battles. It seemed to be more like 'a battle went here, and here, and here...'

I'm looking for something better.",1218412800,3,645,4.440677966101695
172239,5,0941232131,"This 3-hour single disc covers every aspect of the war. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested or someone that may be a teacher.

172240,5,0941232131,"I am a fan of most WWII documentaries. I had not seen most of the segments in this set with the late Walter Cronkite.  I find it to be an excellent supplement to the World at War box set. A true enthusiast will not find this set disappointing. It is over 8.5 hours in length. Most volumes consist of stories that are about 20-30 minutes in length.

It contains interviews with the Doolittle Bombing raid survivors, a Japanese spy from pearl harbor (very interesting and informative,) stories on the Burma Road, Tarawa, B-29 raids over Japan, Okinawa and the Kamikazes, A-bomb mission, Angaur, USS Hornet, Midway and others.

They are pieced together well and add some depth to the picture of WWII that is portrayed so often on the History channel. It is a five star set in its content and quality but does not have the international perspectives or comprehensive view of the war that the World at War has. It also does not have the detailed military analysis that the Battlefield Series has. Still, this set is good and a history buff will enjoy the numerous first hand accounts of events that are recorded in the series. For the Price, it is well worth it.",1120780800,6,1157,4.579710144927536
172241,5,0941232131,"World War II: After Pearl Harbor, 1941-1945 is an excellent wartime documentary that excels where many a documentary fails - it attempts to show the true face of war.  The death and misery of war are shown in a number of pretty graphic (especially for its time) shots of dead and wounded men, grieving refugees and war victims, and mass destruction by land, sea, and air.  There is a good reason for this: the original materials of this film were recorded and shown as the war was progressing.  While we can look back and, in hindsight, see that the turning points in the war go back as far as 1942, victory was far from assured until the final months of the global conflict.  The Allied peoples, those on the homefront especially, could not be allowed to lose an inch of resolve in those perilous days, and the material preserved in this particular documentary helped ensure that the fighting spirit never faded until ultimate victory was obtained.

This video makes highly productive use of its one hour, taking viewers from the day of infamy to the unconditional surrender of Japan in 1945.  The accounts are truly contemporary, given without knowledge of the actual future of the Allied victory.  While most WWII documentaries concentrate on one theatre of the war, this particular video takes you chronologically through the crucial events and victories of the fighting in places all over the globe.  From the defensive victories of 1942 at Midway and El Alamein to the Russian triumph at Stalingrad, from the offensives of 1943 in North Africa to the relentless conquest of Pacific islands by the Allied forces in 1944, from the breakthrough at the Battle of the Bulge to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - it's all covered here.  The war footage is especially impressive; making use of both Allied and enemy films of the fighting, this documentary features some of the most stunning, fight-intensive war footage I have ever seen.

What impressed me the most, though, is the documentary's acknowledgement of the vast number of nations fighting alongside the Americans, British, and Russians in this war.  There's no John Kerry-like belittlement of America's brothers in arms here, as a whole list of nations are given their proper due for the bravery they showed.  Even the French (with the exception of the cowardly Vichy French, of course) come out of this looking brave - and appreciative for the now-forgotten efforts of Allied forces to give them back the country they were unable or unwilling to defend themselves.

The only complaint I have about this documentary is the conspicuous absence of General George S. Patton.  No one should ever talk about the campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, nor the Battle of the Bulge, without mentioning the name of Old Blood and Guts.  I can only assume Patton was not the most popular leader in Ike's chain of command at the time and was thus deprived of a mention in this wartime documentary.",1097539200,,2950,4.860279441117765
172242,5,0941232131,"What you have here are volumes 5 and 6 in director Frank Capra's celebrated ""Why We Fight"" series that is the supreme example of American propaganda during World War II. Capra was a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was commissioned by Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall to make a series of short documentaries that would explain the policy of the U.S. government to the troops that were being hastily assembled, trained, and sent overseas to fight. Eventually the ""Why We Fight"" series was shown to the public in theaters and prints were distributed to American allies in England and the Soviet Union as well.
""The Battle of Russia: The Nazi March Frozen"" is a 57-minute black & white documentary narrated by both actor Walter Huston and writer Anthony Veiller. It begins with Hitler deciding to betraying his alliance with Stalin and attacking the Soviet Union. However, at the end of this documentary the Soviets stop the Nazis at the battle of Stalingrad and Hitler's army suffers a crippling defeat at the gates of Moscow. ""The Battle of Russia,"" which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Feature-Length Film Documentary, is a prime example of the way the Soviet Union was presented as a strong ally during World War II (check out ""Mission to Moscow"" in this regard as well).
The first five volumes of ""Why We Fight"" series focused on Hitler's Nazis overrunning Europe in the first half of World War II. ""The Battle of China: The Assault on the Great Wall"" shifts the focus to the Chinese defense against Japanese aggression. Like the previous chapter, ""The Battle of Russia,"" an important part of the intent here is to establish a sense of identification between the American people with a foreign ally, although Capra does not have to gloss over the political ideology of the Chinese the same way he did with the Communist Soviets.
This explains why this chapter provides a brief history of China and its people and then details why the Japanese wanted to conquer the country, namely getting the raw materials and slave labor necessary for taking over all of Asia. The War in the Pacific covered, showing the valiant effort by the Chinese to stop the Japanese. Also featured are General Claire Lee Chennault's famous Flying Tigers, the American Volunteer Group who had joined the battle to defend China. This 67-minute black & white 1944 documentary is narrated by writer Anthony Veiller (Walter Houston just does the voice of Abraham Lincoln this time). In the next and final volume, ""War Comes to America,"" the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brings the United States into the war and in 2000 the ""Why We Fight"" series was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry and remains a prime source of archival footage for the period.",1085270400,2,2776,4.821802935010482

I was living in Nova Scotia at the time. There were Navy,Army and Air Force bases all around me. Soldiers,sailors and Airmen were everywhere. Troop trains passed through our town ,and at night the windows were blackened,Air Raid horns were sounded and the towns were  blackened. It was common to see planes practicing overhead. Halifax harbour contained great numbers of ships preparing for convoys of troops and war materials. Each child in schools had gas masks and wore them for drills. There were aluminum drives to collect the metal for making planes,war bonds and war stamps were sold to raise funds for the war effort,stamps were issued for rationed things such as sugar,meat,butter,gas,etc. ships were being sunk along the Atlantic shore,and in The St Lawrence by German Submarines. A Nazi sub got trapped inside the nets of Halifax Harbor and finally sunk. Another Nazi sub sunk an unarmed ferry  ""The Caribou"",between Suydney Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
 Also the radio continually had news about the War and the daily newspapers covered events in detail

 There was no TV at all;but Newsreels were always a feature at every movie theater. As to being up to date ,they were several days behind the events,as film had to be flown back from Europe or Asia. It was always B & W .It was similar in quality as you will see in this set.
 There seem to be several formats of this set. The one I have has 2 VHS tapes. The first is titled  ""Submarine Warfare"" and lasts 53 minutes. The secondis titled ""Attack! The Battle For New Britain"" and lasts 59 minutes.
