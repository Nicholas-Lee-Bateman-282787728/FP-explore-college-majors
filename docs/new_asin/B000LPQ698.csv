8163120,4,B000LPQ698,"A smart fun film about the film industry and an actor whose star is falling. He takes to mentoring a young actress. Ching Wan Lau struts scruffy-cool all the way through, good enough to make this seem like it's really about him. Siyan Huo, as the mentored one, portrays good character arc from naive and quirky to strong-willed and independent. Good performances and good writing elevate this above simple cynical insider display.",1350518400,,430,4.986111111111111
