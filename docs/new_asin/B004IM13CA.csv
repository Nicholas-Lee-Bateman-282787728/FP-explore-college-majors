8430816,2,B004IM13CA,"What Planet Are You From - Seung-Hee, a young movie director with a promising career loses all hope when he and his girlfriend Hye-Su have a car accident and she dies. A few years later he runs into a poor girl Pok-Shil who looks exactly like Hye-Su at the street market in a remote country town. They develop a relationship despite very different worlds they live in, but it turns out Pok-Shil was indeed Hye-Su's long lost younger sister. Now brought back into her real family, which runs a big film studio Seung-Hee works for, it is a matter of time before her mother who still blames Hye-Su's death on him finds out about their relationship.

One Fine Day - Gun and Ha-Neul happily lived together as young children after Gun's father and Ha-Neul's mother had married. However when the parents died in a car accident, Gun was adopted by a family that later moved to Australia, and Ha-Neul by a wealthy man who may have something to do with their parents' death. Years later Gun goes back to Korea to find out more about his father's death, and uses it to extort money from the wealthy man to fund the medical costs for his sick step-sister Hyo-Ju who loves Gun. However when Gun and Ha-Neul meet again, their happy childhood memory turns into love.

These two are typical Korean soap operas: lovers torn apart by twists of fate so soapy that they make your brain slip in your head, and bad people who will do anything to get in their ways. ""What Planet Are You From"" was slightly better because of Choeng Ryeo-Won's comical acting, but ""One Fine Day"" was almost creepy for the weird step-sibling love. If you are into this sort of stuff it may be be OK, but if you are looking for great original stories you have to look elsewhere.",1322352000,2,1734,4.501587301587302
8430817,3,B004IM13CA,"One Fine Day - Acting in Australia was a bit dry and cheesey.  First time I've heard of these actors, so can't really comment about them.  However the storyline was basic, not really a heart stopper or moving drama.  Hence only 3 stars.

What Planet are you from - The female lead played both roles well.  It's a drama you have to watch from the beginning to piece together, however a few episodes closer to the end kind of fell through for me.  3 for this one too!",1314921600,,465,4.2272727272727275
8430818,4,B004IM13CA,"What Planet Are You From - I love it, especially Ray Won, he's perfect for the role and the rest of the characters, they did their part very well.  One Fine Day - it's only Gong Yoo, I can say why I watched this drama, there is no sense in the story, the ending is not clear.  I don't like it and some characters did not do their parts very well.",1310688000,,346,3.859154929577465
