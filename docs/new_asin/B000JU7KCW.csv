2679178,5,B000JU7KCW,"Rotation is one in a string of German films that sought to investigate how a seemingly civilized country could be drawn into the madness of Hitler-Fascism. The film spans over 20 years, and shows how Printer Behnke slowly becomes a member of the Nazi -party, refuses to act when his Jewish neighbors are arrested by the SS, and then when he is finally betrayed by his son, a member of the Hitler Youth. It is certainly a classic, among the other films of the DDR-based DEFA studios!",1214784000,13,482,4.551724137931035
2679179,4,B000JU7KCW,"Director Wolfgang Staudte cowrote this fine film with his father Fritz Staudte together with Erwin Klein. Both Staudtes took part in Reinhardt and Piscator productions, and in Hans and Lotte's wedding entertainment American audiences may hear Brecht and Weill.

This powerful work was released three years after Staudte's ""The Murderers Are Among Us"". In contrast with that film's depiction of an educated paragon tortured by conscience, Rotation traces the lives of Berliner everyman Hans, his beloved Lotte, and Lotte's politically-engaged brother Karl from the depression and runaway inflation of the 1920s through the return of economic normalcy, the Nazi ascension to power, war, impending defeat, the battle for Berlin, and finally war's aftermath and reconstruction. Rotation opens during the fall of Berlin. Sheltering from the battle outside a woman hears the Soviets have reached the Moabit district and she immediately leaves safety to dodge the bombs and shells outside. Why? Our interest of course is immediately piqued. The film then flashes back to 1925, the year of Hitler's reorganization of the NSDAP. Hans strives heroically to provide for Lotte and their dear son Helmut. Hans is a good neighbor to the Jewish family downstairs. Karl the communist thinker and activist fights both capitalists and Nazis. Hans, Karl, and Lotte care deeply for one another and for toddler Helmut. Hans resents the class oppression which feeds children of the aristocracy cake while Helmut is sick and malnourished. Hans is jailed for labor organizing. While not endorsing the NSDAP he accommodates the party in order to secure work he desperately needs to put food on the table. Here Staudte and DEFA show industrialists solidly behind the NSDAP while Karl and Hans have only the backing of fellow workers. For years Hans refuses Karl's entreaties to join the struggle, citing his family responsibilities. Finally out of devotion to his brother-in-law as well as to humanity Hans commits acts of resistance and is betrayed by Helmut, who is now a committed member of the Hitler-Jugend. It is the ramifications of this act for Hans, Lotte, and Helmut in the context of their love for one another which begins and ends the film.

Rotation celebrates the strength and continuity of human life and love: love erotic, filial and fraternal.",1169510400,39,2335,5.240641711229946
8152972,5,B000JU7KCW,"When I was in the EAD-USAF as a Captain (later a Major). At the AF University, in Academic Instructor and Foreign Officer School, one of the subjects I was able to pursue was the International War Crimes Trials (IWCT) in Nuremberg, Germany.  I was astounded how the Hitler Jugend were indoctrinated with unquestioning obedience to authority, and the overwhelming majority of Germans were mesmerized to accept Hitler as the New Messiah to dismiss Jesus Christ as a ""clever Jew.""  This DVD is a masterpiece produced by Wolfgang Staudte and told by the Germans themselves how it happened.  A German family became divided over the Nazis.  A Son who was a Hitler Youth member betrayed his
Father.  His Father survived the Concentration Camp, and after the war, meets his Son again.  Father and Son are reconciled and go on with living.  I have shown this movie to other professional colleagues who were thoroughly impressed how the Germans told the story themselves and went on to rejoin civilization based on the Natural Law of Universal Right and Wrong - truth, justice and the value of every single person.  Five star rating is applied to this movie that should receive more.",1480896000,,1173,4.888888888888889

8152978,4,B000JU7KCW,"East German film shot in B/W about a man who subterfuges the Nazi cause using his position at a newspaper printing press in Berlin.  His only son, a devout Hitler Youth member, finds out and turns him in.  The dad is to be shot by firing squad, but is saved by the invading Russian Army.  After the war the son returns and the dad forgives him.  This film has a lot of underlying themes-how a society can be led astray by promises of jobs-war as a destroyer of families-and family forgiveness.",1420243200,3,493,4.384615384615385
8152979,4,B000JU7KCW,"I have been watching a ton of German movies lately.  This one is a bit ""Mickey Mouse"" in that it was made not long after the war and the continuity isn't great.  But the story is great.  It demonstrates a Father's undying love for his son - unconditional and no matter what.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1348444800,,313,4.0
8152980,5,B000JU7KCW,I was afraid a dramatization of such an eventful period in German and 20th century history would lend itself to sweeping generalizations for the sake of the narrative. But I was really impressed by how the makers of this film were able to believably ground the events of 1930s and 1940s Germany in the lives of one German family. Superb acting and cinematography. I highly recommend it.,1266537600,7,386,4.776119402985074
8152981,4,B000JU7KCW,"I am not a student of films and I have no expertise in filmography but I do enjoy watching foreign films. This is a black and white WWII movie about the effects of the Third Reich on a single close-knit family. The protagonist's (Hans Behnke) son joins Hitler Youth and tattles on his conscientious father's efforts to provide for and protect his family. Behnke is a not a party man, he works assiduously, upholds neutral principles and family loyalty. His apathy towards overt Nazi party affiliation and the use of his printer's skills to publish anti-Nazi literature to help his doting brother-in-law (Kurt) land him in trouble. The War ends, there is reconciliation between him and his son. His son's transformation and realization that evil is preventable are the kernels of this movie. Filmed in late 1940s, in German with English subtitles, its technical limitations compared to current technology actually enhance the effects of fear, paranoia and desperation. Behnke's steadfast non-affiliation is admirably brought out.

That this story focuses on a single family is its strong suit.  There is due time given for Behnke's character development. He joins the party, albeit reluctantly, just to keep his job and provide for his tolerant wife, Lotte, and his much-loved son, Helmut. Unemployment, crushing hunger, Helmut's malnutrition, shock of filial betrayal and the pervasive spying by Nazi secret service all test Behnke's convictions. At times he compromises, and at others he suffers immensely for not relenting. This raises the dreaded perennial question, ""What would you have done under these circumstances?""

The film closes with a coda showing Helmut falling in love at the same location as his father did 20 years earlier. Helmut, now repentant and transformed, seems to hold out hope for a future that does not repeat its destructive past. He promises as much to his new love. We know differently now; we humans have since broken our internal promises and reengaged in many newer destructive acts. Sorry Helmut!

For us, now in early 21st century, this is a painful realization because we are incapable of not repeating ourselves - BUT our hopes to the contrary sustain us.",1216080000,22,2192,5.131652661064426
