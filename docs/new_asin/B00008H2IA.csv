I didn't expect a big Hollywood production or anything but the makers of the film should have been more than grade schoolers at least. The story was bad and the acting was awful. It was either over dramatized or under acted in most of the movie. The story starts out with a woman dying and everyone being upset about it. Granted, this would be very true. But in the next sequence, the brother-in-law of the dead woman is soo upset he is not performing at work and is having nightmares about her being gone. Come on....don't you think that it should have been the husband of the woman that was having these problems? The rest of it is just that stupid as well. I am not recommending this movie to anyone. There are alot better out there that are cheaper in price and alot more entertaining to watch.",1171238400,,858,4.36875
7984544,4,B00008H2IA,Great scare flick!  It takes you in different directions ala THE SIXTH SENSE.  It's been Omega's top seller for years and for good reason.,1038182400,,138,4.708333333333333
7984545,3,B00008H2IA,"With all of the [bad] horror...I've seen over the years, it's refreshing to see a movie that at least attempts to tell an interesting story.  Yeah, the acting is so-so, the production values are limited, but it's a good effort.  Well worth the seven bucks I paid for it.  I could have done worse, I could have bought ""Panic Room"".",1038009600,5,330,4.466666666666667
7984546,3,B00008H2IA,"This movie is proof that even with a low budget you can make an interesting movie. The acting is so-so, sometimes over-dramatic, but something tells me they didn't make a lot of money off of this piece. There are some creepy scenes and some of the stories told in the movie will give you the chills if you think about them long enough. There are some editing flaws (mainly continuity) but it makes the movie even more fun. The DVD that I had had some problems in the beginning, video was dropping, etc. but it may have just been a bad copy. If you are in the mood for some cheap entertainment, this is it.",970531200,4,605,4.269565217391304
