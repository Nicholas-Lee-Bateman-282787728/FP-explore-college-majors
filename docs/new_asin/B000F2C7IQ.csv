8116505,4,B000F2C7IQ,"If you haven't read or watched Blake and Mortimer, it's akin to Tintin in its ligne claire style and world-traveling adventurous style. But where Tintin was a veritable eunuch, Blake and Mortimer are two gentlemen who wrestle with their mutual but forbidden and ultimately unconsummated love.  To be sure, their attraction and momentary intimacies are deftly hidden within euphemism and symbolism, but an  observant viewer can hardly miss the meanings intended for the minority adult audience living in a world wrestling with its own gathering acceptance.  Perhaps one day a fresh artist take up the pen put down by Blake and Mortimers' original creator, Edgar P. Jacobs, and ""properly"" finish the beautiful tale he began, with the tender embrace we fans have all been waiting to see.",1329955200,,784,5.15748031496063
