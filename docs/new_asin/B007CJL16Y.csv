5077642,4,B007CJL16Y,"I'm Mexican, so I have in on good authority to say that 90% of Mexican comedy films are horrible. Obvious jokes, hammy acting, bad timing, no sense of flow... So it's quite refreshing to find a movie that gets it right. I've heard contrasting opinions on this, people either hated it or loved it. I loved it. So funny, original, unique, smart, visually striking... Joaquin Cosio anchors the whole thing and this is hands down one of his best performances ever, he rocks every scene he's in. The supernatural elements are so refreshing and uniquely mexican, yet never cliched.",1376006400,5,575,4.818181818181818

  Chucho Juarez is a policeman. He had his heart set on playing the part of the devil in this year's Christmas play, Pastorela. He has played the part of the devil for many years. He couldn't wait to show his fellow actor playing ""God"" (Ernesto Yanez) his new devil costume. He broke the news to Chucho that he will not be the devil this year because Father Benito Garcia passed away after making love to a nun. The Father's last request was to get Father Edmundo Posadas to replace him at the parish. Father Posadas is very experienced in exorcisms.
  It is up to Chucho to convince the new priest to let him play the devil.

5077644,5,B007CJL16Y,"I bought this movie on the recommendation of my friend Alberto (profession: Mexican) because my complaint that Mexico lost the humor and playfulness (humor for the whole family). In favor of the film met my expectations and convinced me that Mexico is on track to regain its greatness in film. In contrast, a Mexican need for me to explain some expressions of double meaning and what is the ""Pastorale"". Very good movie, was looking for a good comedy with surreal touches. Five stars, if that's what you want.",1355875200,,509,4.795454545454546
5077645,5,B007CJL16Y,"The history starts with the death of the pastor (in circumstances somewhat ""unusual"") from the town of San Miguel de Nenepilco, as is customary in ancient people's traditions are all, in this case the conclusion of the typical pastorale is a very rooted by the people of the community. And many doubt the death of the pastor is performed again, but soon the World exorcist Father Posadas (Carlos Cobos) takes the baton for the celebration.
When new comes with their own ideas and decides to leave out Jesus Juarez federal agent (Joaquin Cosio), who until then played the role of devil's work, of course the agent is not at all pleased with this and starts a battle between him , his friend (Eduardo Spain) who stayed with the prestigious role and the Priest in his eagerness to do things his own way ends complicating everything.
Basically this would be the story of Pastorela, throughout the film we see known actors in roles like Anna Serradilla irreverent in a nun's role and Mr. Eduardo Manzano as a cardinal, among others that contribute to the tape droll moments. The performances are scheduled at times have no interpretation required for the role and others severely overreacted.
But the comic skill of the cast makes the story bearable to plasma, however the script written by Emilio Portes is imaginative as it takes one of the most deeply rooted traditions in Mexico and deformed to make a comedy, but this is good , has its flaws as downtime and some holes in the story that it could be also correct that some of the dialogue is forced.
Those highlighted in the film for its interpretation are Carlos Cobos, Joaqun Cosio and Eduardo Spain latter being a good team when the sequences between the locations chosen for the film are the Church of San Miguel de Nenepilco and the historic center its surroundings making it even more droll situations.",1336608000,3,1857,4.752321981424148
