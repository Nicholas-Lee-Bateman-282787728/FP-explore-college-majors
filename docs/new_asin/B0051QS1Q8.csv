4525774,4,B0051QS1Q8,I thought the packaging was well done and the content was both interesting and unique. It just boggles the mind what the mind will end up doing in a given situation. I would recommend this DVD set to those of whom would be interested in such a subject.,1361836800,,252,4.270833333333333
4525775,3,B0051QS1Q8,"Narration very good. Stories as okay.  We are surrounded by all kinds of virus and bacteria that drive us crazy. Learning how to deal with these organisms is very difficult, because first of all you have to find which one is the problem and maybe when you find out it's late.",1358467200,,275,4.392156862745098
4525776,5,B0051QS1Q8,I think I own all of these...wish they made more they are all very interesting.  Thanks for the quick service.,1358035200,,110,4.5
4525777,4,B0051QS1Q8,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about cases of strange illnesses and Medical mysteries. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. Bitter Potion: The flu-like symptoms of a mother and her children proved to be indicative something much more serious: thallium poisoning. Investigators had to find the source of the poison... and when the mother died, to determine if the exposure was accidental, or if they also needed to find a killer.
2. Breaking the Mold: A healthy three-year-old boy suddenly develops respiratory and neurological problems, and doctors can't explain why. Then his father begins to exhibit signs of Alzheimer's Disease. His mother becomes ill while traveling in an airplane; fortunately, the passenger seated next to her makes his living by removing toxic mold from buildings. When she tells him about her family's health problems, he suspects their home might be making them sick.
3. Broken Bond: When a two-year-old boy was rushed to the hospital suffering from brain seizures and breathing difficulties, doctors could not find the cause of his illness. Then the boy's sister provided an important clue, and raised the possibility of a syndrome of which few had ever heard.
4. Core Evidence: In 1996, more than a dozen children in Seattle, Washington, were fighting for their lives. Each one of them had contracted a serious illness, and no one knew what it was. When one of the children died, investigators knew the clock was ticking.
5. Deadly Formula: Detectives learn that a genetic disorder caused the deaths of a woman's children, resulting in an overturned conviction.
6. Fatal Fungus: An infant was rushed to a Cleveland emergency room with serious breathing problems. The baby's lungs were bleeding, a life threatening, extremely rare condition. Within months, there were more than 30 cases - an incidence more than a thousand times higher than anywhere else in the world.
7. Legionnaires' Disease: An examination of ""Legionnaires' Disease,"" so named after it decimated a 1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia. One hundred and eighty attendees developed pneumonia-like symptoms; 29 individuals died.
8. Nursery Crimes: Why do children at a Texas hospital seem to be dying at a higher rate than at any other hospital in the country? Medical investigators have no answers until they discover that one nurse seems to be on-duty in almost all the fatal cases.
9. Something's Fishy: Two people in Seattle, Washington died after taking an over-the-counter pain reliever; lab analysis of the pills showed they were tainted with a lethal concentration of cyanide. The investigation which followed led police to a suspect with a motive for murder.
10. 'Til Death Do Us Part: The doctors at the hospital couldn't determine the cause of Bobby Curley's hallucinations and intense pain. At first, they treated it as a neurological disorder, but Bobby's condition deteriorated. Something he was being given in the hospital wasn't curing him, it was killing him.
11. Ultimate Betrayal: On a windy October night in 1995, a mysterious fire swept through the home of a doctor and his family. Two of the family members made it out alive; two did not. In the debris, investigators found evidence which told them much more than how the fire started.
12. With Every Breath: The year was 1993, and young Navajos on a reservation in the southwest were dying at an alarming rate. CDC officials had never seen anything like it, and the mysterious illness had claimed the lives of more than 20 people. The tribe's medicine men provided investigators with a critical clue... which would lead halfway around the world to a most unlikely killer.",1352160000,13,4283,5.214804063860668

4525782,5,B0051QS1Q8,"A real eye opener.  Had seen the show on tv about a mysterious illness in a family that was traced to black mold throughout the house.  Family survived but had to move to maintain their health.  Based on that show we ordered the 2 disc set and were not disappointed.  Not only were we able to watch the mold show again, but many more interesting, informative shows.  A fine addition to  our library at a great price.",1412467200,2,416,4.337662337662338
