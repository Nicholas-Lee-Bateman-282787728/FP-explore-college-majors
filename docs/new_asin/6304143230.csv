790786,2,6304143230,"I recently purchased this movie for my vast Zombie DVD collection,
I have approx. 150+ zombie movies in my collection and thought this would fit right in seeing the name of the title and the recommendation of a friend.

I did some reviewing online and saw a few trailers, and knew that this would be a B- rated movie,
but after watching it, I give it an F
For Fail!

The movie goes, when a clutsy, dimwitted weed smoking army soldier transporting a barrel of radioactive material to a disposal facility loses it, then a clan of backwoods hillbilly moonshiners find it and turn the misplaced barrel of chemical waste into a whiskey still.
Going blind from a bad batch is the least of their worries as the toxic moonshine (a green liquid that looks like green Kool-aid) turns them & anyone who drinks the juice into REDNECK ZOMBIES!
As the redneck zombies stagger around looking for their next human happy meal, they come across a group of out of place Yankees camping in the outskirts that become their feast of southern-fried gore & goodness.

I read that there was supposed to be mayhem that will turn your stomach and tickle your funny bone!
I didn't find it in this movie.

I was also told to grab a seat and set a spell with your favorite gut-chompin, tobacco chewin' cannibal kinfolk from hell in REDNECK ZOMBIES! It wasn't there.

I don't know if this movie was intentionally supposed to be this bad with its low budget, horrible character makeup, terrible acting, bad (but supposed to be scary) scenes that arent, special effects that need some serious help and the nonsense of thats not supposed to happen.

If you're looking for a scary zombie movie, this isn't it, If you're looking for something with gore or suspense keep looking, if you're looking for a zombie flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat,
Look elsewhere, This movie is cheesy and not the average zombie movie cup of tea.

Would I recommend someone buying it? Well if you want to own every zombie movie ever made, then sure I would say yes buy it, If you're looking to own a decent made zombie movie that you will watch over and over or even at least a time or two, maybe three, I would say no!

There are better zombie movies to own than this one.
This crap rates right there at the bottom of the barrel of horrible zombie movies alongside with Zombiez

My recommendation for a zombie movie consumer, don't waste your money on it,
as for me I bought this movie for my vast zombie DVD collection, watched it once and will then place it with the rest of my zombie DVDs to collect dust and never be watched again.",1409356800,,2596,4.471458773784355

790883,3,6304143230,"Redneck Zombies, (1987), is a low-budget gore-horror/comedy film about a group of hikers in the undead hillbilly backwoods of rural Maryland.

I've never seen a Troma Entertainment movie before, so this was my first experience, and one I'll most likely not forget.  I thought it was executed fairly decently considering the obvious budgetary restrictions, and I look forward to watching similar projects from this company.

The acting wasn't great, but the humor wasn't bad.  There were a few scenes that I chuckled at, but for the most part, it was your typical horror-cheese.  Nothing exemplary there.  The gore, however, was plentiful, and realistically hammered out throughout the film.  I saw a few chunks of what appeared to be real meat being ripped apart by the zombies, so that's notable.  I also thought the writers and director did a fine job creating a cast of individuals that definitely stood out as their own characters.  (My favorite was the chubby white hiker that was drinking the whole time.  Win.)  I also enjoyed the sporadic parodies of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Watch for those...

At film's end, I certainly wasn't wowed by the effort, but I can see why it's garnered the cult following that it has.  This isn't your typical indie horror movie.  There's something special here, and I'm glad I finally let Troma take me for a ride.

790884,1,6304143230,"Over the past years the brothers Sid have come across inordinate amounts of B in every genre known to man. Some of our finding have been absolutely epic and somewhat mind altering, or maybe that's just the chuck, and some have been just straight up losers. In an unfortunate event we were finally given the opportunity to witness the cult favored Redneck Zombies and couldn't have been more disappointed. Now clearly we were far from any high expectations for a legitimate horror here, but figured there would be plenty of laughs when you combine zombies and hicks (a Sid favorite pastime). In some odd turn of events there wasn't a single laugh to be found. The only amusing factor was the film quality rising no higher then a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>&nbsp;entry...possibly much much worse come to think of it.

Redneck Zombies doesn't have much of a plot other then what the title explains. A bunch of backwoods hicks gets their hands on a tub of toxic waste which spills into their moonshine causing them and their fellow dim whited buddies to turn into hungry zombies. That with some horrid acting and 70's porn style camera work is about all there is to it. As we sat in a state of sheer boredom we simply couldn't get through the entire flick not wanting to waste the streamlining on it any further. There isn't a B out their we're against checking out, but this one should remain on your ""NEVER WATCH"" list along with other features like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Night/dp/B000J10F6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween Night</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rise-of-the-Scarecrows/dp/B002I7V9WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rise of the Scarecrows</a>.

790886,1,6304143230,"Warning: If you were involved with this movie in any way, please just stop reading right here. I doubt you'll like what I have to say about ""Redneck Zombies.""

People who call this a ""B"" movie don't understand what B movies are all about. This is definitely an F. I am sorry to say it, too, because every description of the plot makes it sound as though there is plenty of potential for a good, enjoyable, snark-worthy really, really bad movie; the kind that is so bad you enjoy watching it to laugh at it. When I sat down to watch it with two friends, both of whom love bad zombie movies, I expected to have a lot of fun. Instead, we wasted our time.

The basic premise is that a container of radioactive waste gets into the hands of some illiterate, ignorant, and incredibly unintelligent rednecks, who proceed to mess around with the stuff, getting it into their moonshine and from there contaminating the region's rednecks, turning them into zombies. There is an obligatory group of hikers who have come into the region (obviously not from ""around here"") and fall victim to the redneck zombies. Much gore ensues.

As I said, the premise has tons of potential as both a humorous romp and as a send-up of other horror movies. However, even as a comedy, it fails because there is nothing funny in it. The ""stupidly inbred redneck"" stereotypes aren't clever enough caricatures to be funny--heck, even saying they aren't clever enough implies some intelligence to the humor, but there isn't any. The gore is--well, to say it is gratuitous is to tar it with the same brush all zombie movies deserve, but let's put it this way: One of my friends watching this, who LOVES gore--the more, the better, as far as she is concerned--had to cover her face for the gore scenes. (As I did.)

Unfortunately, the acting is also pretty horrible. There are a few people in this movie who can act, but they are helpless against the sheer unrelenting badness of the script and the less than stellar acting of the other characters.

Having said all that, I know that there are die-hard fans of Troma, the production company that created this film, and those fans love this one a lot. In fact, many Troma fans say this is the best movie Troma ever made. (At which I am speechless. I cannot imagine how bad the other ones must be for them to not be ""as good"" as this one.) If you are a Troma fan, then you might well agree with those other fans, so don't let my review dissuade you from watching it yourself.

One last note: If you disagree with my review, please don't rate it as ""not helpful."" Rating a review as ""not helpful"" simply because you disagree with it dilutes the usefulness of rating reviews. If my review provides enough information for someone to make a more informed decision about what the movie is about, what the quality of the movie is, and whether it is their kind of movie, then it is helpful.",1260576000,2,2895,4.515267175572519
790955,3,6304143230,"1987's ""Redneck Zombies"" is a prime example of a great idea for a story that is executed poorly. It was shot on tape, giving it a truly unique look (think of it as 'soap opera-vision') and the title has the basic premise for a great story, but it's directed poorly and has (with a few exceptions) uninteresting characters like the Tobacco Man and the main heroine, who is bland and without any personality. The addition of characters like the Tobacco Man just add confusion to the viewer's experience and left me feeling kind of empty.

On the flip side, the movie's unique look from being shot on video adds an amusing atmosphere that doesn't let up for the entire run time. The character of 'Ellie May' is very funny and he should have been the primary comic relief instead of the camper who figures out that bug spray (was it bug spray?) is what kills the zombies. But that's about it. The special effects, gore wise, anyway, are good for an extremely low budget, but the humor is too over-the-top and out there to be funny. The movie could have rivaled the likes of Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" if it had been a serious, balls-to-the-wall horror flick, void of any humor and just two hours of gore, gore, gore, blood running down the screen, but I think the filmmaker's intention was to make a comedy horror movie, but instead of being funny it just sort of feels bloody and kind of pointless. That's not a condemnation, just an observation. But the humor isn't very good unless you were a young person in the 80s and feels heavily dated compared to ""Evil Dead II,"" a horror comedy which came out the same year that managed to be both funny and horrifying. Now, I know that a movie called ""Redneck Zombies"" is a far-cry from ""Dead By Dawn"" but still, it's, as already stated, a great idea that's executed poorly.

As for the DVD itself, I bought the Tromasterpiece Collection (Spine # 2) two disk edition with the soundtrack on the second disk. There are some good extras and the packaging is beautiful, with wonderful cover art for the DVD. All in all, it definitely is a Troma movie, but even for a Troma movie it seems kind of trashy-- and that's saying something. But, if you're in the mood for zombies and have exhausted all your George Romero and Lucio Fulci movies, I guess it's not a bad way to pass a rainy Saturday afternoon. After all there are worse movies, like ""The Video Dead.""",1258416000,,2395,4.503448275862069

This movie delivers everything is promises. It has zombies, it has rednecks, it has zombie rednecks. It has a ton of gore and courtesy-breasts per the genre standards. While it is good for a few laughs, some of which are even intentional, it is mostly just boring and terrible.

Sure, it is meant to be cheesy, and it does have some recognizable parodies of other horror movies that the audience might appreciate. The campy-fun and satire do not carry the movie very far. It is not b-rated, it is c, d, or maybe even q-rated, whatever rating is just barely above what an unpopular film student makes in college (and it is above that mostly because of the decent camera work).

Whatever it is, it's both smart and sophomoric at the same time.  Oh yes, and ultra-gory too.

This DVD release improves immensely over Troma's original release.  For one thing, this is a new master seemingly created by Ed Bishop (with some slight ""improvements"" here and there).  This means that the ""Where's a nice place to take a s---"" line isn't truncated like on the original DVD.  The psychedelic sequences also have some additional effects added to them.  Aside from this, the disc comes with a bonus soundtrack CD, 45 minutes of interviews from 12 cast and crew members, a fun commentary track, original promo trailers, outtakes and deleted scenes from the R-rated video version of the film.  Basically, if you're a fan of REDNECK ZOMBIES, you absolutely must own this release.

790962,1,6304143230,"Warning:  there are spoilers in this review but believe me, I'm not spoiling much.

The first question is, can you make it through the whole movie?  Well, I was bored and had nothing better to do, although in retrospect I could have watched the grass grow.  'Redneck Zombies', to begin with, is filmed on video, that's how bad it is.  It's like a high school project that got an 'F'.  But with a writer named Fester Smellman (it's true), you get what you asked for.

A military jeep hauling a drum of toxic waste loses the drum off the dirt road and is scared away by a fat redneck.  The fat one then gives the drum to Pa Redneck and his three sons, one of whom insists on being called Ellie May and wears his shirt tied around his sagging belly.  The rednecks think it's a new still and begin brewing.  The hooch comes out green and awful, but of course they drink it anyway.  Ellie May leaves to make the delivery run to town.  Pa and sons drink the hooch and turn into redneck zombies. (they kind of melt)  Meanwhile, some novice campers enter the woods to set up a camp.  It's not long before the zombies find the campers and of course, the feast begins.

Some things to watch for (if you actually watch this tripe) are instead of the ice cream man they have a ""dip"" man.  (chewing tobacco)  There's a delivery scene to the freelance butcher that makes no sense, a drooling redneck and a duck-taped girl sitting in the living room watching baby chickens on the TV.  There's the obsessive/compulsive camper who changes his shirt all the time, and is the one who discovers that the zombies can be killed by spray deodorant.  There's the pre-vet school camper who freaks out and does an autopsy on one of their dead friends while hallucinating that he's pulling out shoes, ears of corn, and a rubber ducky, before throwing up into the incision.

The acting is atrocious, the FX is horrible (strawberry jam, red corn syrup, raw liver, and chicken parts) - there isn't one redeeming feature of this movie except that the makers of it acknowledge that it's a comedy and not to be taken seriously.  My recommendation is to always listen to one of my favorite reviewers, Jeffrey Leach, when it comes to horror.

3. The strange rednecks bring characters to each of the zombies instead of random walking rotting corpses.

4. The guy drinking various alcohols in each scene is great.

791113,1,6304143230,"This movie is absolutely, utterly, and completely devoid of any value. I like low budget schlock, and I love camp, but this is neither: this is trash. While the plot is bad enough, the acting, and endlessly repeated gore makes this a triple threat: do not even think of wasting an hour and a half of your life on this.

The plot concerns a moonshine still made from a drum formerly used for transporting radioactive waste and the hilarity that results when the already retarded inhabitants of a hick town are rendered even more brain dead. There are subplots about a mental hospital (which is a corny framing device, yet goes nowhere), racism, and the tobacco consumption habits of idiots, yet none of these manage to further the story in the slightest. The one subplot that does further the story (kind of) is about the stupidest multicultural band of campers you have ever seen who happen to decide that they want to camp out near the nuclear still.

The plot is just a minor inconvenience that occasionally gets in the way of endless low budget, yet still reviling, gore. Cheesy early digital camcorder effects help hold the story together, so you've got that going for you. Of course amongst all the moonshine swilling and innard eating, we learn from a zombie autopsy (!) that zombies can be killed by one type of aerosol deodorant. What kind, you ask? The movie goes out of its way to insist that it can only be deodorant containing Aluminum Chlorohydrate, which is the actual active ingredient in many types of anti-perspirant. If you want to repel zombies at home, the chemical formula is Al2Cl(OH)5. I knew all the chemistry I took in college would come in handy one day.

The film has many other repulsive bonuses such as the corncob-in-the-eye competition, but by far the most repulsive part of the movie is the soundtrack, which contains many original tunes with lyrics you will be hard pressed to forget, particularly the ""Love Theme From Redneck Zombies."" (I'm not sure that's the actual name of it, but you will know which one I mean when you hear it.)

This is entertainment for teenage boys at its worst. I bought this film only because it was marketed with the much better ""Inbred Rednecks"", a film of subtle nuance, poise, and intellect compared to this.

791116,1,6304143230,"If someone ever cornered me by asking why I waste my time watching Troma films, I would have a tough time giving a convincing answer. It seems like every few weeks I end up watching one of these nightmares. I simply don't know why. Perhaps I am too lazy to turn these monstrosities off once the movie begins. Perhaps my love for low budget junk provides enough inspiration to bravely gut it out after I realize the movie is yet another Lloyd Kaufman sponsored disaster. Who knows what drives me to punish myself. I can tell you that ""Redneck Zombies"" presented me with a particularly painful conundrum. I knew the movie would turn into an all out gorefest at some point, but the lead up to the real bloodletting caused so much physical and mental pain that it almost wasn't worth waiting for the payoff. Cosmic questions of massive import assailed my brain as I waited for the film to grind to its inevitable conclusion: why are we on this planet? Will I fulfill the goals I have set for my life? And why am I wasting two hours of my physical existence watching this dreck? Some questions have no easy answers. Some questions have answers best left unexplored. ""Redneck Zombies"" is a movie best left unseen and unexplored in any way, shape, or form.
I'll give director Pericles Lewnes some credit; he created a shot on video film that challenges the very conceptions of what bad means. ""Redneck Zombies"" is such an abominable, wretched project that it soils even Troma's reputation. Imagine, if you dare, a bunch of soldiers hauling a drum of toxic waste through the backwoods of some southern state in a jeep (Yep, a jeep. The Army now hauls dangerous radiation in a jeep. Sigh.). Predictably, the drum falls out of the truck and breaks open. A trio of brain dead moonshiners discovers the drum and decides to mix up a batch of special liquor in it. The firewater mixes with the residual traces of the radiation, resulting in an oddly colored drink that knocks the socks off the local imbibers. It also turns anyone who drinks it into flesh eating, overall wearing zombies. Over the next hour and a half-it feels like infinity-most of the residents in the area drink this nasty brew and suffer the consequences. There's a bit of gore here as some of the infected residents make quick work of those who didn't drink the glowing liquor. The real fun starts later.
A group of campers unfortunately picked this exact time to hike around the backwoods for a few days. The group, largely and thankfully forgettable as actors, is the most moronic group of campers I've seen in a horror film. I would just try and accept them for what they are-victims-and move on. Only one guy stands out of the crowd, a real doozy of a fellow who does nothing except stand around drinking liquor and laughing. Trouble starts slowly at first as some of the campers stumble on the still that made the toxic moonshine. Predictably, oh so predictably, a couple of the hicks stumble out of the woods and quickly make mincemeat out of a couple of the campers. When the others discover the bodies, and realize how much trouble they are in, the fun starts in earnest. A mad scramble ensues as the rapidly diminishing group attempts to clear out of the area. The problem with this chaotic plan comes in the form of packs of zombified hicks lurching around the forests and plains, ripping and tearing their way through the terrified humans. A central question emerges as the film comes to a close: who is stupider, the campers slumming in the backwoods or the zombie hicks? If you find the answer, please let me know.
Did I mention this movie is a strictly shot on video project with a budget of approximately seventy pesos? Lewnes tries to trick the movie up by routinely employing video camera effects and gimcracks that even a high school student working on a video yearbook wouldn't use. Hence, you get a lot of color trails, pictures within a picture, and the like. It's neat stuff if you've spent your entire life in North Korea, but quite amateurish and gaudy to the rest of us. Not to beat a dead horse here, but the photographic techniques used in this movie are to the modern world of cinema what Pong is to modern day videogames. What does work on occasion is the extreme gore at the end of the film. Some of the carnage unfolding onscreen is quite unpleasant, and sporadically effective, for a zero budget production. If the viewer didn't have to wait so long to see the sauce, ""Redneck Zombies"" might have merited a more positive response.
You might think Lewnes could compare with Peter Jackson of ""Bad Taste"" and ""Dead Alive"" fame since both men cut their teeth on extremely low budget horror. You would be wrong. Jackson's films were excitingly creative, gross, and humorous affairs that will leave a lasting imprint on the world of low budget horror. Pericles Lewnes, on the other hand, only leaves behind blight. As far as I know, he never made another movie. Typical of Troma Studios, the DVD release has plenty of cheesy extras. The usual trailers and shameless Troma self-promotion are here, as is an interview with Lewnes and another guy associated with this travesty. Save yourself a few hours of your life and avoid this clunker at all costs. And hey, don't worry-there's no need to thank me for warning you in advance.",1086048000,13,5311,4.645058448459086

791194,3,6304143230,"""Redneck Zombies- The Director's Cut??"" Finally, someone restored this cinematic achievement to the glory that the director intended, censors be darned!
The story, as it were, has a barrel of nuclear waste being dumped in the backwoods and turned into moonshine by a redneck family. The rednecks become the title after drinking the stuff, and attack some well meaning, pot smoking campers. The entire film is a series of very gory attacks as the zombies multiply thanks to all the moonshiner's customers. Instead of killing the zombies with gunshots to the head, the campers find they can kill them with spray anti-perspirant.
This came out way before Jeff Foxworthy made a career of making fun of people from the south. The stereotypes here are all offensive, as the film makers make fun of rednecks, blacks, gays, etc. The comedy is of the Hee Haw variety, with plenty of ""I'm so stupid"" jokes, as well as a ripoff of better horror films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""
Most impressive here are the gore effects. This was obviously shot on video, but the nonstop gore is very good. The cast are all local talent, and do what they can with the material, although the makeup effects are the real star. The movie is not very good, but future film makers might see that you do not need a huge budget to get some very good gore effects on camera.
""Redneck Zombies- The Director's Cut"" comes from Troma Video, and the barrage of commercials at the beginning of the video will attest to that. I am not a huge Troma fan, but this silliness is one of their better efforts. I slightly recommend ""Redneck Zombies.""

I love zombie films, my favourite being Zombie Flesh Eaters directed by Lucio Fulci (I would say the absolutely fantastic Evil Dead trilogy, but you can't really call them real zombies). I jump at the chance to watch any zombie film. So when Redneck Zombies started, it's a wonder that I restrained myself from throwing the remote at the TV screen.
I have never seen such a cheap film in all my life. Having never heard of the film company ""Troma"" before I was expecting to watch a half-decent zombie film, with excellent gore and make-up effects. Just colouring a man's face in green doesn't substitute for a good zombie.
The use of camera was so terrible, and the first zombie transformation scene just makes you want to be sick (not from gore, but from the terrible effects the film makers used).

So zombies (or ummm people with real bad makeup) start coming after these campers which is beyond funny. Actually the gore was pretty good, still cheesy but still pretty good. I like when they whip out the Tennessee Torpedo LOL..If you want lots of laughs get this movie. If your looking for a serious movie, get something else. Another funny movie from Troma, Of course",987811200,5,681,4.544715447154472

I have even seen ""Children shouldn't play with dead things"". But this movie holds a special place in our hearts. Why you ask. My best friend was in it. His Name is Jeff Harris. In one version he is simply listed as Zombie. In another version he is listed as the smiling zombie. He wears a camo hat and coat and has a smile that makes beavers envious.

This movie has it's moments. If you are a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you're in for a treat because there is parody of the hitchhiker scene- I almost busted a gut all over myself. If you are seriosuly thinking of buying this movie just for the fact that it is a TROMA RELEASE(not actually filmed in Tromaville, just distributed by them), may I suggest to check out the more recent Tromeo and Juliet or Class of Nuke'em High.

791326,1,6304143230,"I got this video thinking it would be as good as The Toxic Avenger, which while it was gross and juvenile, was incredibly funny and had some social satire.  This... constitutes as an hour and a half of not just bad, but *painful* acting holding together a putrescent cream filling of gratuitous gore filmed with a video camera and a caseload of ketchup and hamburger.  I can stomach gore as much as the next Troma fan, but the acting was so blatantly dull, annoying, insipid, and insulting I had to turn off the film in disgust before the good, gory bits could occur.  The worst part about the film is that it tries to be funny... but the constant barrage of nothing else but hyperactive yelling, bathroom humor, and fat jokes created a film with absolutely no point or redeeming feature whatsoever.  It appears that this is a movie that people either love or hate, and I have to say that this is the only film I've had to turn off and give up on in the middle for years.  But who knows?

791398,4,6304143230,"While the quality of this film may scare some viewers off at first, rest assured it gets pretty good throughout the film.
The film is at it's best when it is following their stereotypical characters and becomes outright  hilarious!
I was in tears laughing during the autopsy scene in this film.  I though I was going to die laughing!
If you keep your eyes open for  specific things each character does throughout the film, if makes it all  the more funny!  For example, there is one character who never talks, but  always has a bottle of alcohol to drink from in every single scene of the  movie.
Released by Troma, but not made by the Troma team, Redneck Zombie  is a pretty funny gore-comedy.  Don't take it as anything else and you'll  love it!",956707200,3,747,4.507462686567164

I was the zombie wearing the Air Force flight jacket and was  cast only at the end; the sceens where we were grouped to stagger around in  the field like in Night of the Living Dead. It was a once in a life time  experience to be in the making of horror film classics. This movie combines  qualities of a number of well known classics. See how many you can  identify. The story line is profound and there is good theater in the main  acting parts. I was never involved in anything but the simple shooting of  the zombie attack in the field.

Instead, steel yourself for another foray into the collective mind of Lloyd Kaufman and his minions. As the introductory narration intones: there's a spill of toxic chemical waste, annnd, since there are hillbillies -aka: ""actors"" w/ dirt smeared here and there- in the vicinity, zombies soon arise. Somewhere, there is a home movie that -might- be worse than this, but hopefully, it will never be found! Anyone, anywhere, could round up the first ten people they run into on any public sidewalk, and together, they could produce a ""film"" that is far superior to this fertilizer! At least other TROMA films, like TOXIC AVENGER were funny, and made some sense. Not this idiocy! Oh no! Now, simply being nonsensical isn't an automatic disqualification. Hell, some of the most entertaining movies ever made were utterly absurd! Nope, REDNECK ZOMBIES does what no movie should be allowed to do. It bores the $#!+ out of the viewer! Boy howdy!

The group that didn't get a callback.
The group that failed the casting couch.
The group about whom mom and dad just don't speak much.

But they found each other.  And they made a movie.
It proves, if nothing else, ANYONE can.  Unfortunately, they did.

Not PC, never funny, often doesn't even make sense.

And while it is frequently confusing, it is very predictable.
