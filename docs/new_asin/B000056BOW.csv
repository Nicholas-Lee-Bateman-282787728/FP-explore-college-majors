1396711,5,B000056BOW,"As you might have read from other reviews, this is not a movie rather than a stand up comedy film.  I dare anyone to watch this and not find it funny.  If you don't laugh, then you don't have a sense of humor at all. The show is about the concert tour of the same title that was the 2nd highest grossing tour of the year.  Steve Harvey is the MC and provides his own touches of brillance throughout the show.  His ability to relate to people on all walks of life is evident from the moment he takes the stage.  He warms up the crowd for each comedian but the crowd doesn't need it, since you barely regain control from laughing so hard from the last joke you heard.  D.L. Hughley is great in this, although I, personally, think that his set could have been alittle better.  I had just seen his last comedy special before the movie, so I was alittle jaded.  Next is Cedric the Entertainer.  The man is awesome.  The way the he accents his jokes with phyiscal style is brillant.  To top off the show is Bernie Mac.  Simply put, he steals the show.  I could not stop laughing when he was on.  To not own this DVD is a crime.  I will be the first in line to get it when it arrives.  You should do the same. I hope this helps.",980035200,21,1221,4.067226890756302
1396712,1,B000056BOW,"But, I didn't find this movie funny at all. I sat and watched every minute and never once laughed out loud. This was a major disapointment. Steve Harvey's material was tired and old. Cedric ""the Entertainer""'s set was flat. The only moments I found remotely funny were all contained in Bernie Mack's set. And there weren't nearly enough to make up for the other three ""kings"". Anyone who is thinking of wasting their time and/or money on this film would be better served renting Eddie Murphy's ""Delirious"" or any of Richard Pryor's old shows and watch a couple of true kings at work.",979689600,9,583,4.669902912621359
1396713,5,B000056BOW,"When I saw this movie last August it had me rolling in the aisles. All three of the comics get their man. But I have to say Bernie Mac was the funniest , in particluar the skit about his sister's kids. If you liked Raw, Delrious or Live At The Sunstrip you'll love this movie.",976233600,2,276,4.036363636363636
1396714,4,B000056BOW,"I'm going to start the review off with the obvious: this is not a movie, but rather a documentary on the Kings Of Comedy Tour.  In other words, a stand-up comedy film.  You're probably reading this and wondering ""why would anybody sell a collection of comedy skits as a full-length feature film?""  See the movie and you'll understand.  While no doubt suited for television viewing (partly because they're all on BET), the experience in the theatre gives an overall impression of being there, actually watching Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac toss their routines live.  As for the performers themselves, some of them are downright hilarious - I particularly like Steve Harvey and, of course Bernie Mac - while DL Hughley is kinda so-so, spending most of the time talking about panties and dissing audience members.  But even the weaker performances survive because the performers are energetic and bristling with enthusiasm.  This ends up making the material seem a lot funnier than it really is.  I guarantee you'll find yourself laughing till you're crying over jokes that really aren't all that funny (like me as well as everyone else that was in the theatre).  DL Hughley is no doubt decent overall, and Cedric the Entertainer has his shining moments, although as a whole they aren't really anything special.  Emcee Steve Harvey and Bernie Mac, on the other hand, are awesome.  Steve Harvey's material is actually funny to begin with (I LOVE the Titanic bit at the beginning), but a lot of it is inspiring as well.  He manages to find humour in love, spirituality and family life without sounding blasphemous or disrespectful.  Most importantly, he means every single word he says, and that connects with the audience all too well when talking about romance and love.  As for Bernie Mac: THIS is the skit that makes the movie so good.  Without a doubt the star of the show, Bernie talks rudely about his kids and his unique parenting techniques, and pokes fun at other parents.  His subject matter can be a little risky, but he never comes through as disrespectful or snarky.  Whereas Steve Harvey delivers his skits with pure honesty, Mac's charm comes from the fact that its obvious that not a single word of it is true.  This allows him to explore territory that others may be afraid to.  As a whole, this movie is highly recommended if you love to laugh.  It is an entirely worthwhile way to kill two hours, and I can guarantee you'll leave the theatre (or television) with a gigantic smile on your face.",970876800,26,2543,4.802298850574712
1396715,4,B000056BOW,"D.L. Hughley, a stand-up comic and the creator-star of TV's The Hughleys, is explaining why bungee jumping has not caught on with most  African-Americans. ""That's too much like lynching for us,"" he  says, shaking his head and adding, ""You're going to tie a rope around  me and push me off a bridge?""
Hughley's bungee riff is among the  better routines in Comedy, a documentary by director Spike Lee that  captures a show in Charlotte, N.C., by Hughley, Harvey, Cedric and Mac,  comics who have been performing nationwide to enthusiastic, primarily black  audiences for the past three years. All four stick to observational humor,  much of it revolving around racial differences.
A lot of this is funny,  but it never gets as wrenchingly deep or dark as Richard Pryor's routines  in his classic concert films.",968112000,,808,4.962686567164179
1396716,5,B000056BOW,"This film is truly spectacular.  Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric THE Entertainer and Mr. Bernie Mac are outstanding comedians who are not afraid  to tell it like it t'is.  I have seen this film twice already and am going  to see it again and again and again...can't wait for the VHS release  date.
Although the language and subject matter are explicit...SO WHAT!  These men know from what they speak and are able to translate what could be  a painful and difficult situation into something that EVERY person on this  earth can relate to.  My only question is: why did the studio only release  it to so few theatres?  The film is a hit so let's give these Kings their  props!",968112000,,677,4.55
1396717,5,B000056BOW,"The Original Kings Of Comedy are indeed,the true kings of the comedy world. They earned the title of world heavyweight comedians for good  reasons. The #1 reason however, is their performances in this movie and  their overall 2 year nationwide comedy tour. I've seen many live on stage  standup comedy movies before (Martin Lawerence,Richard Pryor,Eddie Murphy  etc...), but this one by far is the best. This film showcases the  incredible talents of Cedric ""The Entertainer"", D.L. Hugley,  Bernie Mac, & Steve Harvey at there very best. All 4 of these comedians  can do individual shows with success ,but when you put them all together  its just untouchable. I can not really say one comedian was better than the  other because all 4 kings performed very well.  Each comedian had his own  special impact on the film. The only thing that could possibly make this  movie any better would be if Chris Tucker or Chris Rock was a 5th member.  Nonetheless,these 4 kings are so funny, you forget there are any other  comedians in the business. If you love comedy and want to watch a fun show  that will make you laugh til' your stomach hurts, then I suggest you see  ""The Original Kings Of Comedy"".  I know that it is a must for me  to see this film again. I will get this movie on DVD the day it is  released. This movie is straight up hilarious and outragously funny. Its  just a good show to watch whether you're black or white. It just can't any  get better than this.",967593600,20,1466,4.561538461538461
1396718,5,B000056BOW,The Original Kings of Comedy was off the hook. Everybody was great but Bernie was the man  It's great and I recomend seeing it over and over again  I've payed to see it three times already,967161600,,188,4.194444444444445
1396719,5,B000056BOW,"Forget Jim Carrey! Forget Marlon Waynes(?)! Go see Cedric the Entertainer! This movie was so much funnier then the other summer comedies. I think that  Cedric and D.L. Hughley were hilarious! The part with Bernie Mac, however,  was sick. Hearing him say ""I will (explicitive) your kid up"" is  funny the first couple times, but soon wears thin. Hearing him call his  sister's kid a ""fa--ot"" is less appealing. Go to see it for  Cedric, he is side splitting!",966729600,2,456,4.7215189873417724
