5144816,3,B0089PCXAS,I found the routine boring.  I have purchased a few of their DVDs and watched their youtube videos and they do the same exercises over and over and over.,1414886400,3,153,4.275862068965517
5144817,5,B0089PCXAS,Great video,1413849600,,11,5.0
5144818,4,B0089PCXAS,I find the 4 workouts are good for each part of the body. The stretching is a good balance in between my yoga and ballet classes to help keep me limber.,1381881600,11,152,3.935483870967742
5144819,5,B0089PCXAS,"Really unique compared to the other programs out there. Great stretch. Each workout is only 25 minutes, so it's easy to fit in and I feel relaxed and good afterwards. I feel like it does for me what yoga never did.",1380931200,33,214,4.2439024390243905
5144820,5,B0089PCXAS,This helped me work through some serious shoulder pain. You can tell a real difference in range of motion and strength after a few weeks.  It is really a great program.,1371081600,41,168,4.419354838709677
5144821,4,B0089PCXAS,"The workouts are great, They really work if you use them everyday. But the DVD that I recieved did not work correctly. The second workout on both DVD's skipped,",1362009600,4,160,4.551724137931035
5144822,5,B0089PCXAS,"This 2-DVD set is one of two new releases this past year by Sahra Esmonde-White (the other is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essentrics-Workout-Class-of-2012/dp/B0089PCE66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essentrics Workout: Class of 2012</a>). Sahra is the daughter of Miranda Esmonde-White, founder of the Classical Stretch workout series. Although the exercises in the various Essentrics workouts are quite similar to the parent Classical Stretch programs, in general, the music tends to be a bit more upbeat, the setting more modern (here, the Montreal Science Center), and the overall sense seems to be that Essentrics is striving to appeal to a somewhat younger audience than Miranda's followers.

The two Essentrics discs in this DVD set are nicely packaged (they came with a bit of foam between them for cushioning). There are two 25-minute workouts on each disc, with the Main Menus lists options for About Essentrics/Classical Stretch, Workout 1, and Workout 2. Sahara instructs all of the workouts live, sometimes by herself, sometimes with two background exercisers. I have broken down each of the workouts in detail below.

DISC 1--STRENGTH IN MOTION

*Workout 1: Core & Legs*
Sahra works out here with Pier-Luc and Erica. I liked that she began with some brief upper body stretches; in fact, although all of the routines in this set have defined target areas, they are definitely full-body workouts. However, I found the standing flow segment to be a bit repetitive, as there seemed to be a lot of cutting the air/lunging and reaching/pulling moves. After 10 minutes of standing, Sahra and crew move to the floor for an abs segment. In full disclosure, I tend not to like traditional abs work involving crunches, etc., so I was not a fan of this section. Moves here included hip raises, leg scissors, and flutters. I did enjoy the side leg lift series which followed, as this nicely targeted the outer hip. Finally, this workout concludes with a nice 5-minute stretching segment, starting lying for the baby stretch and moving to seated for a series of groin and other stretches.

*Workout 2: Full Body*
Sahra was alone here. This routine started with an easy warm-up consisting of gentle throws, tennis moves, and kicks. Next came a really nice series of stretches for the shoulders, back, and abs. Continuing to work the core and posture, Sahra performs plies and a move very similar to Miranda's ""Caribbean Spine."" She then does an arms work segment which includes bow and arrow as well as moves working the arms and legs together; this is followed by additional plies. This all-standing workout concludes with a 5-minute standing stretch which targets the quads, soleus, hamstring, and calves.

DISC 2--STRETCH IN MOTION

*Workout 1: Hips & Hamstrings*
Sahra is alone again for this practice; with the exception of the warm-up, she uses a barre (chair) for the majority of the workout. Again, she begins with a few nice upper body stretches here, then moves on to some work with the feet and ankles. Moving into a series of stretches using the barre, Sahra performs hip cleaners, quad stretch, and hips, glutes, and psoas stretches with the foot on the seat of the chair. Continuing with the foot on the chair, she moves into a long series of hamstring stretches, thoroughly targeting this area, including the IT band. Sahra sits on the chair to perform calf stretches, and she concludes the workout with about 3 minutes of standing stretches for the side and back.

*Workout 2: Shoulders, Upper Body, & Hamstrings*
For this workout, Sahra is joined by Pier-Luc and Shana. The warm-up gradually moves into lots of nice, shoulder-opening work (i.e., a more gentle version of Miranda's ""shoulder blast""). This is followed by a unique shoulder/neck rotational move--loved this! Sahra then performs standing calf and quad stretches. At about halfway through the routine, she moves to the floor, starting with lying on the back for a long series of stretches including the baby stretch and then continued stretching/lengthening from a seating position involving groin stretches, back work, and calf stretches.

Overall, this DVD has been a GREAT purchase for me! I love the 25-minute length of the workouts (easy to use as add-ons), and the workouts themselves are just wonderful. Although I use all four routines regularly (virtually weekly since purchasing the DVD back in May), I particularly enjoy the second workouts on both discs, probably due to the amazing shoulder opening work in these two routines. Highly recommended!",1356652800,130,4580,5.213315217391305
5144843,5,B0089PCXAS,love the workout,1478736000,2,16,4.666666666666667
5144844,5,B0089PCXAS,"Similar to other Essentrics workouts with Sahra and with great music!  I prefer Sahra's workouts than Miranda's, because I find them a little be more strenuous than the Classica Stretch ones.  I also prefer Sahra's cueing.  Highly recommended for lovers of Essentrics!",1477958400,5,268,5.333333333333333
5144845,5,B0089PCXAS,Great!!,1471478400,,7,7.0
5144846,5,B0089PCXAS,I like the slower pace in this one. Miranda & Sarah pretty much do the same techniques. The major difference is the pace & location. Sarah looks like she's in some type of warehouse & Miranda does hers outside. Afterward you will feel good and loose.,1464220800,6,250,4.456521739130435
5144847,5,B0089PCXAS,"I purchased on another site. am able to do exercises where could not do  yoga some people state it is hard to follow I don't agree and I am 65. I love it
.
I gained mobility from broken foot I could not stand on either leg for long without falling down now more and more am able to put on pants without tipping over. funny but that small thing makes me happy. quite during winter am in high hopes of much improvement in other areas as have started doing exercises again",1461542400,3,469,4.0978260869565215
5144848,2,B0089PCXAS,I have been doing the Classical Stretch program for a little over a month using the Miranda Esmonde-White Mobility and Bone Strengthen DVD and I really like those two workouts.  These workouts are much more up tempo and difficult.  I am sorry I didn't just get another DVD from the original Essentrics person.,1458345600,7,309,4.811320754716981

5144852,5,B0089PCXAS,"I am recovering from a surgery and have had to be very sedentary for over 6 months,  I purchased this as an ""easy"" way to get my body used to moving again.  After 10 minutes of basic ""stretching"" I was feeling like I had would have to take a break.  I stuck it out and just went a little easier and was able to complete the 20 minute session.  You will work muscles that you didn't realize were there,  you will be a little sore afterwards, but nothing like doing a full workout with weights.  Amazing low impact workout for your body!",1450224000,7,535,4.196078431372549

5144864,5,B0089PCXAS,"I had never used a stretch program before but had seen one of these
on PBS and thought I'd give it a try for a much lower price.  Easier just
to send in a donation.
I really like the stretch disc for flexibility due to injuries years ago
and I've never really had the flexibility, but decided in order to stay
fit enough to hike and travel I'd better get with a program.

I like the stretches and the instructor is good, more like a real
human than a ""robot"" type.
The only problem I have is that sometimes the instructions are not
really clear for a novice and due to that it's hard to keep up at times,
but I figure after several times of going through the program
I'll probably get it down.

I would have given this four stars, but honestly I feel so much better
after I do these stretches I can only give it a Full Five Stars.

If you do a lot of hard work, either at a desk or manual labor this can be
a life saver, especially if you have lower back issues or sciatic nerve
problems as I do.

As always check with your Doc to make certain you're able to do this
program.  If so,  I highly recommend it.  You may ONLY think this is not a work out.
I never knew how much work it would be.",1448409600,5,1191,3.9747899159663866
5144865,5,B0089PCXAS,Item arrived very quickly and was intact.  Love the dvd,1446940800,,55,4.5

5144867,4,B0089PCXAS,I can definitely feel a difference in the looseness of my body after doing this workout I have to say she seems to get a little lost at times when giving instruction not sure how many videos she has done. I seen her mother on PBS but thought I would want a younger instructor but maybe her mom is is more seasoned when it comes to instruction so I will try one of her moms videos next.,1445212800,,385,4.012987012987013
5144868,4,B0089PCXAS,This is a really great beginners stretch !,1445126400,,42,4.375
5144869,2,B0089PCXAS,"There should be more information given regarding the age group and/or capabilities of the purchaser.  This is for very young, fit persons, not for the elderly.  I had to return it since I could not use it, but sadly it still cost me $26.48 with a refund of only $16.51.  Believe me, I will NEVER order a work out DVD/CD.",1442620800,7,320,4.3
5144870,3,B0089PCXAS,"I've done a number of Essentrics workouts with an instructor, so I thought I was prepared enough for this dvd. The Strength dvd though is too advanced for me and she goes way too fast. The Stretch dvd was better.

However, the issue I have with the dvd's is that she isn't reminding you very well of what you need to do during the work out. Like reminding you to pull out of your hands or feet, to stretch-stretch-stretch, reminding you to keep ""tucking under"", don't scrunch up your shoulders or hip, and things like that. These are all things my instructor is good at doing, and therefore get a MUCH better workout with her rather than the dvd's. It's hard to keep up and pay attention to all the different things on your own when you're not reminded. I was hoping that the dvd would be similar to my instructor's method of teaching, but it's not.

Overall, I wish I hadn't bought this for how expensive it was and would just rather stick with the class I'm able to go to because I don't think I'll use the dvd very much. This was a my first dvd and I doubt I'll buy any other ones.

One last thing---the room she is in does make it look back-lit, but this wasn't a problem for me with a newer tv. I think if you have an older, darker tv then it'll be a problem for you to see what she's doing with all the light behind her.",1438560000,20,1326,4.171875

5144887,5,B0089PCXAS,"I have a ridiculously large number of exercise videos that I have been using recently (including Ballet Beautiful videos), but the ones in this package are my favorites.  Pure Barre does almost nothing for the upper back.  BB dedicates very little time to stretching.  Weirdly, my feet are notably inflexible, and I have even done special foot exercises to loosen them up. But without focusing on feet, Essentrics somehow made my feet more flexible than they have been in long time time.  So with Essentrics, I know that my entire body is getting attention.  And I feel ready to take on the world when I am done.  When I do these, I don't get stiff, but instead remain wonderfully flexible.  This workout does not require great flexibility to start, like many do. Everyone should try Essentrics!",1435190400,11,795,4.801470588235294

5144890,5,B0089PCXAS,"Perfect workouts.  25 minutes and I feel totally stretched and strengthened.  After 2 months of doing Marie and Sahra's DVDs my posture is becoming so much better.  I am so much stronger in the legs and lean in the waist.  It is having a positive effect on my appearance, my horseback riding, and my back problems.  Not to mention my legs and feet.",1433635200,7,348,4.4603174603174605
5144891,4,B0089PCXAS,Really like this.  It's easy to follow.  Stretches you & strengthens.  Would like to find another with a whole body routine to stretch every muscle.  Recommend for any age.,1433289600,2,172,4.827586206896552

Not the case.",1431648000,8,292,4.051724137931035

5144900,2,B0089PCXAS,"Although these work-outs have many of the same movements as her mom's, which are great, they are filmed in front of a large window and heavily back lit, so that it is difficult to see what she is doing. Also she goes at a pretty fast pace which adds to the difficulty of following. I would recommend that people get the mom's new program. She does them outside and in good light.",1424304000,51,379,4.277777777777778

5144902,5,B0089PCXAS,"Love this workout, although it is definitely oriented for the younger set. Fast-paced, some of the movements are difficult to pick up. Some may not be appropriate for oldsters with arthritis and osteo problems.

It's set up in four 25-minite segments: two on strength and two on flexibility. It's so easy to find 25 minutes for a workout. I alternate the strength and flexibility workouts, and I like it so much that I usually start with a 25 minute segment, and then continue right on into the second set.

I do yoga, Tai Chi and Pilates. This is a great combination of all of them. There is no holding positions here. It has a balletic flow. You're in constant movement, which seems very natural to me. This has quickly become my favorite exercise tape. So glad I bought it.

I very quickly saw an effect on my waistline and stomach, and I'm a senior. The music is beautiful, it's beautifully staged with Montreal in the background, and the leader, Sahra Esmonde-White, is not only gorgeous but also very encouraging.

It does move at a fast pace, and some movements may not be suitable for all. But if you have normal health, I highly recommend it.",1421366400,81,1151,4.6

These dvds are pleasant to watch and are easy to follow.  I would recommend this to everyone and anyone. We could all use a smart, gentle exercise routine that is not all about seeing how hard they can kick your butt, but instead its about improving your flexibility and strengthing at the same time......this will over time keep you injury free and feeling better all over so you can do those insanely hard, butt kicking workouts!",1516838400,,612,4.545454545454546

8526397,4,B0089PCXAS,"I love essentrics but every one of these segments is too slow for me except the floor one in the strength section. I thus wasted my money. I don't need all of that talk. I get the movements and can do all of them without a lot of instructions. Perhaps it is the ballet background or the body intelligence I have. I do the full body workout which is the most advanced on the market and the class of 2012 which is semi-advanced. We need some more essentrics workouts that are for advanced practitioners who like a full body workout at the highest level of exertion possible and at an advanced pace. This is not a criticism of the technique, it is just that I want MORE for advanced level practitioners. Anyone listening? Sahra? Are you there? (Smile).",1485043200,4,749,4.434782608695652

8526400,5,B0089PCXAS,I went through and did all of 4 the workouts in a few days. It made a noticeable improvement in flexibility. I plan to do this every day along with my other exercise program. I really found it hard to believe it helped just after one run through. I wish they had opted to use more camera angles and cut to some close ups as the lighting on the set leaves it a bit hard to distinguish which leg is in what position sometimes (with the black tights). I think I will get it all figured out though.,1482192000,4,494,4.051020408163265
