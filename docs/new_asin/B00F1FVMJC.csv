8611503,1,B00F1FVMJC,"It is the sequel of another movie titled ""Essex Boys"". The first one is bad and this one is worse.
The acting is not convincing. The plot is unbelievable. For example, one of the bad guys openly bribed the policeman in the night club. Then he called the police officer ""c..t!"" right in his face. Not only that, he also yelled at his friend who was standing a few feet away and said this policeman is a c..t again. And he got away with it.

In short, it's one of the worst B movies I have ever watched.",1389916800,,501,4.112244897959184
