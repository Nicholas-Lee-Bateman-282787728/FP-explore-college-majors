3513420,5,B001CIOCOY,"It's a B rated movie but for that being said it is still very funny and entertaining I've actually seen it many times . I'm writing this though not for Jackie long and Jason weaver (does always seem to play same character) which I could watch him play that all day ATL happens to be one of my favorites it's simple and captures something of youth..you can relate to ..This is about one scene with Melyssa Ford ..A gem and I think is very underrated I've seen her in other things such as video girl...What about me? Unexpected surprising she has not been in more, I own thousands of movies I can't say I've seen better acting of being rejected from a women that's understandable and real not over the top ..I think she tapped into something there It felt real and like I was there. I think it was shocking is how beautiful and successful she is you think how could she possibly understand that emotion so deeply..just goes to show we all share same emotion no matter who you are. I rewinded that one part again just to see ..wow she nailed that man.",1467676800,,1048,4.3520408163265305

3513426,5,B001CIOCOY,"One of my husband's favorite movies.  This movie makes you laugh at unexpected times.  LOL.  Some of the characters are so silly that you can't help but not like them.  You can't take this movie too serious, so it's great to kick back and take a load off.  The acting is okay, but I wasn't expecting Oscar moments either.  However, it's still a better one than I have seen.",1455062400,,373,4.333333333333333

3513469,1,B001CIOCOY,"I saw this movie because Jackie Long and Jason Weaver have been in movies I like such as Drumline, Idlewild, and ATL, with the both of them being in ATL together. I also wanted to see Mya in a bigger role as an actress and of the three movies I've seen her in, this one is the one where she gets a lot more screen time compared to The Penthouse and The Heart Specialist. I figure hey sounds like it could be a good movie. Man how wrong I was! It didn't open like a regular movie with a production company logo like the way most movies do. It just jumped right in there without a production company logo, as if it was the opening to an hour long TV show or something. Movies with the production company logo tend to transition better. This movie doesn't have the logo to start, thus the horrible transition. This movie also has too many story lines in addition to the main plot. Now for the performances. Jackie Long was believable as Trey. Jason Weaver was ok as Vince, but my only complaint about him was the secondary story line about his date site and sock obsession. Clifton Powell was funny as Cinque the enlightening enforcer and the only other bright spot in this movie along with Jackie Long. Mya, as much as she is fine to look at, had horrible delivery with her lines. But her performance makes her look like Meryl Streep compared Melyssa Ford. Melyssa Ford ruined this movie and I did not feel bad for her character one bit. And her riveting lines screaming ""what about me?"" and ""what about my feelings?"" were cringe worthy. And the ending was anti-climatic the same way Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist was. This movie is so bad that they should change the title to Love Stinks, because this movie stinks!",1326931200,,1717,4.419558359621451

3513483,4,B001CIOCOY,I first saw the movie on television and even though it was edited and some parts were cut out I still found it to be funny. True to form. It's a comedy. Buying the actual dvd now.,1297987200,,179,3.864864864864865
3513484,1,B001CIOCOY,"Oh my goodness!!!

Where do I start?
Well, the acting was way past poor. Mya was very see-through. She was a beginner and could not hide that.
The script was terrible. It almost seemed like they were making things up as the film rolled along. It was predictable and from scene to scene boring.
Don't waste your time or money.",1280188800,,325,4.416666666666667
3513485,3,B001CIOCOY,"I bought this for my coworker who doesn't know how to shop online.  I guess he saw it on tv awhile back and really liked it.  I can't personally attest to the content of the movie, but the dvd arrived on time and in good shape!  Got it pretty cheap too.",1275004800,,253,3.9215686274509802
3513486,4,B001CIOCOY,"This movie was surprisingly good. Being an independent movie, I was expecting a low budget, ""hood"" movie. Instead I was treated to a really smart movie that actually made you feel for it's characters. There was no corny, over the top acting, well not much anyway. All the scenes that supposed to be played seriously were played very well. I've seen Mya thrown in a movie here and there where she did an ok job of acting. She was more than likely thrown in because the producer or director heard a few songs of hers or their kids liked her or something, so when I saw she was in this I wasn't expecting much from her, but she did a really nice job. Nothing top notch or anything, but she played her role very well. The thing that shocked me about this movie was the acting of Ms. Melyssa Ford! Now mind you, I'm not trying to put her in for an academy award or anything, but she did SO much better than I expected from her. I was expecting her to be what she's been her whole career; eye candy. And as soon as I put the movie on I was watching her, not just because I considered her eye candy, but to see how she was going to ruin a potentially good movie with her horrible, mediocre acting skills. Not only was I wrong, but I was pleasently surprised by her acting. As it turns out Melyssa pulled it off quite nicely. There was one scene in particular where she had a conversation with the main character and began crying, I really felt for her character and felt my eyes water up just a bit. I was like ""Melyssa Ford got me crying?!"" How can the video chic have me crying? I'm sure that she was there mainly for her looks, but given the chance she ran away with this role, the girl NAILED it!
In all, I'll say if you're thinking of buying this movie, go ahead and take the plunge. It's really not bad at all,sure there are a few cheesy scenes thrown in here and there ( the blacklight in the bedroom), but it's something you won't kick yourself later on for buying.",1270684800,,1966,4.203703703703703
3513487,3,B001CIOCOY,"This movie is just okay to me. It ain't really that funny. This movie has a little bit more drama, but it's cool. I got to admit that they put this on bet, i just thought i want to see it on amazon instead of renting it at blockbuster. The only thing i like about this movie is that sexy woman MYA (she is so beautiful), Milessya Ford, and that other lady Esscence Attkins. Never the less, this movie was just ok to me. Could be better.

3513488,3,B001CIOCOY,I bought this movie because Mya was in it. She played the part of a very passive girlfriend and it was not a good part or something that I really wanted to see. No backbone. The roles of the other actors are very flip and I would not buy it again if I had to do it all over again. It's the kind of movie that you could go outside and talk to your neighbor while it was playing and them come back in and see basically the same stuff happening to the people in the movie dating each other. It is not so much predictable but just plain closer to boring.,1260057600,,550,3.919642857142857

3513543,4,B001CIOCOY,This was a pretty decent movie. Very funny! But what really had my attention was the soundtrack to this movie. The Artist are basically no names except for Mint Condition. But I cannot find the soundtrack to buy to save my life. This is the first time that I wanted to buy a sound track and could not buy it.....what a shame!,1239667200,,325,4.258064516129032
3513544,5,B001CIOCOY,I thought this was a great indie film. Acting was great in the lead roles. A few of the minor roles weren't very well acted.

Mya is really growing as an actress she did a great job in this movie.

3513548,4,B001CIOCOY,"I liked this movies for it's use of new unknown actors and at first I couldn't connect the title with the plot. Although I like Mya and Jason Weaver, Clifton Powell presents some funny scenes with the only white people in the movie. The two rappers are funny too and this silly rap song they did got stuck in my head for a couple of days. Also, there is not a lot of cussing in the movie which I found refreshing. I often say so many movies can still make their point without all the cussing. I've watched this movie more than once and liked it more each time.

I also appreciated the fact that two of my favorite stars from Smart Guy were in it (Essence Atkins and Jason Weaver).
