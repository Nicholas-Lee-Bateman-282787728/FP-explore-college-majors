8461336,5,B0058CWO90,"I purchased the France set at Christmas and have since then been completely hooked.  The scenery is stunning and the videography is done really well.  It gives good, ""up close to the bunch"" views urging you to stay on the wheel and not get dropped, interspersed with a quick look around at scenery, then you are up front leading the pack and the pressure is on, and the challenges to chase down the breakaway cyclist are so evocative.  I can't believe how quickly time flies using this and how hard I work, it is so stimulating.  I have been through the DVD with both coaching from Fiona and from Tom and Gene which gives a choice of styles, and I've used it without coaching but taken the concepts from the pros and let me feel for when I want to challenge and push.
The music to this set is also fantastic, using artists I hadn't heard of previously but am now downloading their music from iTunes - thanks for the introductions.
As an indoor cycling instructor it really helps to have visual cues and I'd love to be able to get a licence to use these in class.
Thank you to Gene and everyone at Global Rides - top class.",1360627200,,1122,4.328571428571428
8461337,5,B0058CWO90,"Like other Global Ride DVDs, Club Ride in France has a great balance of coaching/training with great indoor ambience...the roads are pleasant but what makes this outstanding is the back and forth competition of the riders and coaches. There are several coaching options that gives flexibility to the workouts...can be a steady stae workout, interval power, or interval climbing. Living in the Northwest, it has allowed me to put on 900+ ""indoor miles"" in bad weather months without getting bored. As for length, it is comparable to other DVDs, and on rollers just about right, but for longer workouts it's easy to re-do a section for interval training and added minutes/miles...great product!",1356393600,,692,5.1875
8461338,5,B0058CWO90,"I taught this as a virtual ride in my indoor cycling class and it was phenomenal. It was like we were actually climbing the cols of the Alpes! (I've ridden in the Alpes so I felt like I was right back there on my bike). The filming is a perfect combination of viewpoints too, from the front, the side and the rear. Since it is filmed from a cycling perspective you get much more of a cycling feel. When you are behind another cyclist, what great motivation to keep pushing! The paceline DVD allows you to train just like a cyclist would train - working to increase your threshold while in the paceline. Two sets of 20-min @ threshold? Now THAT'S cycling specific! The previous reviewer is doing this on an elyptical (??) so how could she appreciate the cyclist's viewpoint or how a cyclist trains? We're not here just to ""look"" at the scenery, we're here to WORK while surrounded by the beautiful scenery, and these DVDs will do exactly that. [It even says it on the box: stay focused on your training, not just the beautiful scenery.]
Price wise, this is about the same as any other box set, so it's very competitive. The increased value of the Global Ride DVDs is the extra cross training you get that is tailored specifically to cyclists. LOVE IT!",1325289600,2,1250,4.4868421052631575
