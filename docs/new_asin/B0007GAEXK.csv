2211502,5,B0007GAEXK,"The Mole was one of the best and most interesting of all the reality shows - the premise was unique and it had the host with the most, the awesome Anderson Cooper, whose intelligence, wit and charm made this show stand out.",1109808000,11,223,4.333333333333333
2211503,5,B0007GAEXK,"I loved this show when it came out. I am so excited for the DVD, this show is all about mystery and trying to figure out who is the mole... it really gets you thinking, and in the end it is sooo surprising. I wish they had more seasons of this show instead of Celebrity Mole Hawii...cause those people were at most c list stars, and it was only like 6 episodes...so i hope this was of help, everyone should by this DVD as soon as it is avaliabale...i am counting the days until it arrives at my house, and the price is amazing",1109376000,10,526,4.0673076923076925
2211504,4,B0007GAEXK,"Love The Mole - it is one of the best reality shows out there, and it's a shame it didn't last longer. This season is the absolute best and I highly recommend it.

The packaging of the DVD set is not good. When I received by set, all three discs were loose in the packaging. Thankfully there was no damage to the discs, but there easily could have been.

Also, the ""bonus"" features on the DVDs are mostly not great. There are some promos for other shows from the same network (not many years out of date) that masquerade as additional features.

I wish they would improve the packaging but other than that I highly recommend The Mole!",1397347200,,634,4.3559322033898304
2211505,5,B0007GAEXK,This was one of the best Reality TV programs on tv.  I am not sure how many season's there were.  I only saw one which I think must have been the final one.  I looked for it the next season and never saw it.  It was exciting and entertaining.  I too believe they should think about doing a come back season.  Maybe on a channel that will advertise it and get people interested.  I know I will watch.  I would like to have a copy of all the season's except the Celebrity season....I heard it was not good.,1392508800,,504,4.071428571428571
2211506,5,B0007GAEXK,"This season is a gem in terms of how great it is. The tone felt very mysterious at the right times, dark at the right times and light harderd when needed. For a first season it actually doesn't feel like a first season, it's perfectly viewable after seeing any season of the mole (no mattter what country the show was made in). It does carry the cozy feel a first season has, but that allows familerarity with the cast to occur, thus allowing a better viewing expereince.

The cast is very entertaining to watch, there isn't a boring person in the bunch, except those who leave to fast to learn completly. Also opinions of some of the cast may change as the show develops, keeping each person fresh and adding to the show. The attachment to the cast is done so well that you feel the same way the constants do. When they win against tough odds you feel happy and when they fail spectacuraly, you feel dissapointed.

You should be able to formulate good guesses at the end for who wins the show and who the mole is, which helps the show as, when you can't guess who the winner/mole are the season is far less effective. I won't state who the winner and mole are but I will tell you the winner deserved to win and that the mole was a good mole (Espically since I thought the eventual winner was the mole and that the mole was the winner).

All in all a great season of the mole it deserves all 5 stars and a good dvd release. Plus it merits re watches as I watched the entire season before buying the dvd.",1346630400,,1503,4.248251748251748
2211507,4,B0007GAEXK,"As a detail oriented person, I loved this show. Unlike other reality shows that we just watch, you could play along with the contestants as everybody tried to figure out who the mole was. The clues were subtle (too subtle at times but more on that later) and the editing was superb, giving us the information we needed without making it too obvious.

As I mentioned above, some of the so-called ""clues"" that the producers added during editing were far too subtle to be noticeable as clues. They do make fun little easter eggs next time you watch it, but they aren't things even the most observant viewers could expect to notice before being told of their significance unless you're overly paranoid, in which case you'll think everybody is the mole. The quizzes were very in depth- knowing who the mole was wasn't enough. You had to know basically everything that had taken place since the previous quiz and how it all related to the mole.

The other problem with being an intellectually complex show is if you miss even a few minutes of the show, you are hopelessly behind, which is why I think the show ultimately failed. At the time the show was airing, I was never able to get my girlfriend interested because she had already missed the first episode so she couldn't catch up. I'm not advocating that they should have simplified it at all, its just the unfortunate flip side of what made the show great. The nice thing about having the show on DVD is you can pause and rewind so you won't miss anything just because you had to go to the bathroom.",1337731200,,1549,4.5285714285714285
2211508,5,B0007GAEXK,"First of all, this is a great show. But it is also a lesson in how to NOT make money. The owners of this series have decided to release season one and season three despite the fact that the most critically acclaimed part of the series was season two.  They could have made so much money.

The first season was good but not spectacular. The Celebrity Mole seasons were not very good at all. So, these particular DVDs are an awful way to introduce one to the series.  By refusing to release the most popular season (season two), they've missed a great opportunity. Considering it was such a brief series they could have even packaged all four seasons in one product.  But instead they just have encourage millions of potential buyers to look for alternatives like poor quality VHS copies (and maybe even torrents).  So, if anyone has a copy of season two they want to sell, I'd like to know; neither ABC nor Eagle Vision want my money.",1312848000,,933,4.497041420118343
2211509,5,B0007GAEXK,"When this show premiered It was one of a few reality shows on the air at the time. And what set it off from others was the hosting of Anderson Cooper, who was working with ABC News at the time. The rules were simple , a group of people were gather at one sight and asked to do challenges to earn money for the pot. Some were dangerous (getting in a bull ring with a bull and have it make two passes at you). Some were just silly like roll a dice and if it landed on 1,2,or 3 you shve you head 4, 5, or six you die your hair green. At the end of each section the group tool a test to figure out who was the mole, a person planted in the group to sabatoge. I remember watching it when it first premiered and thought that it was smart and exciting. And watching it on dvd just made me wish that it was given as many chances as ""The Amazing Race"" was given. Yes Anderson hosted a 2nd season of the series. It was followed by 2 seasons of Celebrity Mole, and the a 3 season of the non-celebrity show. But bythe time they got to this point it was just not that exciting. I hope they will release ""The Mole: The Next Betrayal"". the second season of the show. And I hope that eveyone will watch and enjoy this show for what it is, GREAT!",1311552000,,1229,3.9397590361445785
2211510,5,B0007GAEXK,"The Mole is wonderfully addicting!!! I must say, this first season is one of the best from the US that I've seen!! The group gets to travel to some pretty awesome places, and the group itself is, for the most part, made up of likeable and intelligent people that make the show fun and interesting to watch! I'm so glad to own it and share it with family and friends!!
now i'm waiting on one of you fellow reviewers to create a mole camp where adults can go and play for 7-10 days...escape daily life and dive into a dream!!! any takers? haha",1310169600,,541,4.262135922330097
2211511,5,B0007GAEXK,"Good quality, quick delivery, no problems. The show keeps you guessing and we did spend a lot of time discussing clues that seemed obvious but in the end were not clues at all. The real clues turned out to be a let down. I'd still say buy it.",1306800000,,242,4.0625
2211512,5,B0007GAEXK,"What a good, solid little show and as with every other series I just wish they'd release more.  Something totally different.  If you enjoy shows like Survivor and Big Brother and The Amazing Race then I can't imagine you not liking this series.  I'd buy more in a heart beat.  Just hope Create Space gets their hands on these and gets them out for us!!",1301616000,,352,4.369230769230769
2211513,5,B0007GAEXK,"This is not your typical reality show where you just watch clubbing , dating ,back stabbing jersey shore style .If your IQ is above average then its must watch .This is game show in which contestants solve puzzles and complete tasks in order to win a cash prize -- all while trying to figure out *who among them is mole* . A player planted to sabotage the game/A Traitor. Each episode contain 3 tasks not just one and on basis of three tasks, you try to guess who could be mole at end of each episode and player with least correct answers is eliminated from show. You can pause episode and try to solve some scenario yourself and keep guessing .This Show boosts your brain unlike most Hollywood and political TV that making us mentally handicap. As expected they were unable to attract enough audience and show was canned in USA but run several seasons abroad and brought back for another season as  as Celebrity Mole Hawaii. Support good tv ,watch this show and spread word if you liked it.",1292630400,,991,4.5055555555555555
2211514,3,B0007GAEXK,This is a great season of a great reality TV show. The Mole is a reality TV Show. They play this game internationally. This is onwe of the best seasons. The Mole is the best in this one.,1291161600,,186,3.9210526315789473
2211515,5,B0007GAEXK,"For anyone who hasn't seen the Mole, it's complex and will make you think. My family stayed up until 2am (about 3 hours longer then we usually stay up watching movies) because we had to figure out who the mole was. Its also quite interactive, and I suggest watching it with friends so you can discuss hints and theories.

The one downside, I'd say, is that I only found it interesting to watch twice: once to figure out who the mole was, and a second time to go back and look at everything again. I'd still highly recommend it.",1285977600,,527,4.3232323232323235
2211516,5,B0007GAEXK,"Purchased The Mole Season 1 for my 14 yr old son for Christmas. He loved it. He didn't waste any time watching it on Christmas day. As a matter of fact, our entire family enjoyed watching it. Great show!",1265846400,,203,4.230769230769231
2211517,5,B0007GAEXK,"The Mole was an unexpected surprise.  As a fan of The Amazing Race, I took a chance based on the reviews and ordered this set to watch with the kids over the break.  The show is engaging, intelligent, and a great mystery to follow (avoid reading spoilers or it will take some of the fun out of the show for you). The show is something of a cross between The Amazing Race and Survivor (more Amazing Race) but with its own uniqueness as well.  The contestants were amazingly well-grouped by the producers and you always think you know who the mole is, and then you don't! We even loved watching the recap show.  It was an intelligent show and I wish I'd caught it when it was on TV so it would still be on!  Now, I just hope they put out the second season, since we have no interest in the celebrity version but would love to see the other season Anderson hosted.",1235088000,,861,4.225609756097561
2211518,5,B0007GAEXK,"This is by far the best reality show ever. The first season is great, as well as the second season. The celebrity editions were crap and the 5th one was only ok. It's too bad that it as great as I thought it would be. Anderson Cooper was a fantastic host. The first season had fun and interesting challenges. If your a hard core fan of the mole like I am, this is definetly worthy of going in your collection. I would also recommend the other versions, like the UK versions (1 & 2) and the Australian mole (1-5). Australian seasons 1-3 are the best. The Australian mole has a great host too for the first 4 seasons. I've never seen the fifth season but i know it's a different host.",1226361600,,682,4.213740458015267
2211519,5,B0007GAEXK,"I have been a fan of the Mole since I can remember. The 1st season is by far the best in my opinion, great music and the show is very well done. Much more mystery than the latest seasons. Highly recommended for those who have even not heard of this show.",1219795200,,254,4.0
2211520,5,B0007GAEXK,"I loved this show when it was on.  My husband is a big fan of Anderson Cooper 360, so it was fun to get this and watch it together.  Since he had never seen the show when it originally aired I tried to throw him off as to who the ""mole"" really was.  My only complaint is the length of time it takes to ship, but it was worth the wait.",1208217600,,334,3.676056338028169
2211521,5,B0007GAEXK,"The Mole (not the celebrity versions), by far, was one of the best, most ""real"" of the new wave of reality series.

Adventure, suspense, humor and a great host in Anderson Cooper makes this a must see for any TV person - not just reality TV lovers!

The only fault may have been that it was too intelligent.  You had to pay attention or you might miss something.  It was, however, easy to pay attention because it wasn't paced fast and once you watched it once, you were addicted!

My hopes are that we get to see Season 2 on DVDand that they somehow resurrect the series.  With all of the poor reality on TV today, this would be ahuge hit!  Keep the celebs home though!",1187049600,,670,4.26984126984127

It's smart and funny, and Anderson did an excellent job hosting it. If you like reality shows or Anderson Cooper then this is the DVD for you.  As an AnderFan and a fan of reality TV, I highy reccommend it.",1186963200,,378,3.8461538461538463

2211526,4,B0007GAEXK,"One of ABC's responses to the success of Survivor, was The Mole, a very different kind of reality show.  Ten contestants compete for a cash prize, but with a twist known to everyone.  One of the players was secretly acting not to win the game, but to mess things up, deceive the other players, and reduce the prize money.  Being able to identify The Mole, is the key to surviving and ultimately winning the game.

Spoiler Warning!!!  If you have not watched the program and do not want to know the results, do not continue further.

Those who saw the program when it originally aired in 2001, may recall that The Mode was lawyer Kathryn Price.  Even if the outcome is known, viewing the proceedings is still fun, as you observe how things unfolded, see Kathryn do her thing, and hear the speculations of the other contestants about who they believe is The Mole.

The game begins in California with a tandem skydive.  The action then shifts to locations in France and Spain.  There the contestants face a variety of tests both as a group, and in smaller teams assigned separate tasks.  Tests include the rescues of other players, a maze challenge, sheep herding, and facing a charging bull.  Anderson Cooper's solemn demeanor adds credibility to the sometimes goofy proceedings.

One of the more exciting challenges is the 'Fortress Test', where five contestants, armed with paintball guns, must prevent a team of unarmed attackers from achieving a goal.  At tests involving evasion or military tactics, the players repeatedly prove themselves inept, even though two contestants are involved in law enforcement.  Their dismal failure at the Fortress is no surprise, with Kathryn once again playing a key role in the fiasco.  It is odd that facing unarmed opponents, the players still wear facemasks.  Perhaps they needed protection in case they shot each other?

In the game's final exercise, the three remaining players are locked into individual hotel rooms.  They must work together to accomplish a series of tasks, so that each one can exit their room.  A complicated and entertaining final task.

With $510,000 as the final prize, the eliminated players are reunited, and the identity of The Mole is revealed.  A summary of The Mole's subversive activities is provided, but an extended detailed revelation would have been more fun.  The so-called `clues' to The Mole's identity are too obscure to be taken seriously.  Contestant audition tapes are included as bonus material.

The Mole was very un-Survivorlike as neither direct competition nor teamwork was emphasized as part of the strategy.  Displaying a level of class, contestants stay in upscale hotels.  Food and shelter are of no concern.  The players face ceremonial dismissal, after partaking of a fine meal.  The action seems to proceed at a rather leisurely pace.  With tests sometimes spaced days apart, one wonders what the contestants did during their downtime.  While fun, the series apparently did not have staying power.  A variation on the theme featuring celebrity contestants, Celebrity Mole also fizzled out.",1160524800,,3084,5.045544554455446
2211527,5,B0007GAEXK,this is an awesome show. better than any other reality show out there. does anyone know if they will release the second civilian mole on dvd and if they are planning on making any future seasons of the mole? i hope so cuz it's the best reality show ever made.,1156291200,,259,4.2

2211530,5,B0007GAEXK,"I watched both of the non-celebrity seasons of the Mole when they were released, and loved both, so I was sorely disappointed when there were no more editions, especially since the game took a back seat to the celebrities in the later editions. Furthermore, after the bravura hosting of Anderson Cooper, Ahmad Rashaad, just did not quite cut it for me, though he was better than I had feared.

That said, I received the first season DVD today from Amazon and my wife and I have already watched the first three episodes. Honestly, it is even better than I remembered. Smart, funny, and engaging, this is reality TV at its best. It is a shame that ABC could not have promoted this show more, because it is better than even the critically acclaimed The Amazing Race.

If you are a fan of Anderson Cooper, well, that is the icing on the cake. He really makes for an entertaining host here, not too involved but not entirely aloof either. In other words, perfect!

Do yourself a favor and but the first season; it will be money well spent for the entertainment value.

Now if they would just release Mole 2: the Next Betrayal!",1148947200,,1121,4.534653465346534

Even reality show haters will love this show.

This isn't for the average viewer who just likes to shut off their brain when watching tv. You got to see players be tested on their physical and mental abilities. The Mole was suspenseful and smart. You the viewer actually got to play along too. After every episode I wanted more.

The first two seasons were excellent and so was Anderson Cooper. The ""celebrity"" edition was ok, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

Definitely check out the seasons with Anderson Cooper.",1142985600,7,590,4.699029126213592

I am seriously hoping the second season comes out, it had more players, thus it is longer then the first! Celebrity was okay but I'm not going to pick them up off the shelves. ABC (or anyone) HAS to pick this back up with regular people, even if Anderson can't host, I'm sure they'll find someone.

2211535,5,B0007GAEXK,"The Mole, the little reality show that could.

ABC released this in 2001, hosted by Anderson Cooper (Anderson Cooper 360, CNN) shortly after the Survivor craze hit the world, to compete. What they had in their hands was, in my opinion, the beginning of the greatest game-based reality show ever. And I say this without the slightest hint of bias.

The premise of the show is this: Hosted by Anderson Cooper, a team of ten strangers work together to accomplish a series of challenges. Completing these challenges successfully adds money to a group pot, which only one of those players can come away with in the end. But here's the catch: One of these players is being paid to sabotage these challenges and keep money out of the pot. That player is ""The Mole."" The player that discovers who the Mole is, wins the money.

What makes it different from other shows is the focus on intellectual ability and psychological strategy, rather than primarily on physical prowess. The first season inspired a second season and two ""Celebrity Mole"" versions: a not-as-good-but-still-somewhat-worth-watching version where the players are all D-List celebrities (Kathy Griffin's words, not mine).

But other seasons aside, the first is where it all started. Truly intelligent people will love this show. Everyone I show it to is instantly hooked. I give the first season a 9.8 out of 10, which is only over shadowed by the beyond incredible second season, which isn't out on DVD yet, unfortunately. At a price of under $16 dollars, picking this up is a no-brainer. Whether you love or hate reality shows, this is the reality show for you.",1129852800,5,1622,4.887272727272728

Absolutely worth the 15 bucks... You're purchasing a part of tv history, definately.  Now lets just hope the memory of season 2 isn't forever lost... :(

how dramatic!",1126224000,2,418,5.088235294117647
2211541,5,B0007GAEXK,"I was elated to learn that Season 1 of ""The Mole"" had been released on DVD.  For only about $15, it's a great value in that it has all the episodes from the series on a 3-disc set as well as some deleted scenes, post-execution reactions, and original player auditions/screen tests.

For those of you who may not be familiar with ""The Mole,"" it was a reality show televised in the US after successful runs in other countries.  Season 1 was aired several years ago and enjoyed a second season with ""civilian players"" and two seasons with celebrities as the mole and the would-be investigators.  However, many Mole fans, including myself, feel that ""The Mole"" season 1, with regular people as its participants, was the height of the Mole reality shows.

In season 1, ten contestsants travel to France and Spain and are given a series of physical and mental tasks to complete that could earn them up to one million dollars for the group pot.  One of the contestants is a mole, who works against the team's efforts to earn money for the pot.  Every few days, all the contestants must take a quiz on the identity of the mole, and the contestant with the least number of responses correct will be eliminated and must leave the group and the game immediately.  In the end, only two contestants will remain - the winner of the group pot of up to $1,000,000, and the mole.

I would strongly recommend purchasing the DVD whether or not you have watched this season of ""The Mole"" before.  For those of you who are new to ""The Mole,"" you will surely find yourself immersed in the detective work of deducing the mole's identity.  For those of you who have seen the show and know who the Mole is already, such as I found myself when I purchased this DVD, it's still a lot of fun rewatching each episode and finding out exactly how the Mole sabotaged the game!",1125273600,2,1844,4.491017964071856
2211542,5,B0007GAEXK,"It's a shame ""The Mole"" never took off in the ratings because, along with ""The Amazing Race"", it's a cut above every other reality show out there.  If ABC had hung in there with ""The Mole"" as CBS did with ""The Amazing Race"", things might have been different.  However, both of the seasons with Anderson Cooper are gems.  ""The Mole"" is truly engaging, intelligent television, and I'm convinced that the intelligent factor is what killed it.  I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who isn't afraid to take their reality tv with a dose of travel, gorgeous locations and mystery, all in the company of a charming host.  I love this show and hope this dvd sells well enough that we'll get season two also.  The celebrity versions didn't cut it for me.",1124755200,27,747,4.578947368421052

2211544,5,B0007GAEXK,"I still use the alias ""The Mole"" not just because it's super secreative, but it's an omage to one of the greatest TV shows ever. Andersoon Cooper is amazing, the cast was great, and the challanges awsome. Hopefully there will be a ""Complete Second Season"" too.",1122163200,2,260,4.673913043478261
2211545,5,B0007GAEXK,"I had the pleasure of getting to know some of these players.  I myself, applied for Mole 2.  I must say they are a wonderful group of people.  I sent some of the Mole postcards to some of them and received a whole lot more back.  Personally, Kate and Wendi are super nice!  It's too bad that the Mole never really took off, like Survivor, which is another great reality show that I enjoy very much.  I give the MOLE 10 stars!!  If you like reality shows, like me, you will most definitely like this one!",1117324800,5,503,4.177083333333333
2211546,5,B0007GAEXK,"For die-hard fans of the show, this 3-disc set is a nice tight collection of this wonderful show's first season. Any reality show fan would also probably enjoy watching this show. A great facet of the DVD set is that it contains most of the elements of the original broadcasts, including what could be deemed unnecessary (the ""coming up"" clips and even the casting call for Mole 2) that serve to just add an air of completeness. The bonus features on the third disc include execution reactions, many of them with a sad tone but at least one that is truly wacky and bizarre, along with application tapes and interviews from each player. At only 15 bucks, it's a great buy also. I highly, highly recommend it",1113264000,16,706,4.566929133858268
2211547,5,B0007GAEXK,"Most of the other reviews forcus on the show, so I decided to write a DVD for anyone wondering about the audio, video, and bonus features.  (I agree with the other reviewers on the show - it is most definitely my favorite reality show of them all and is leaps and bounds above the others in maturity and intelligence.)

VIDEO - The video quality is great (much better than my old VHS tapes).  Watching on my 20-inch flatscreen TV it looked very clear, like it was filmed today.  The only time video isn't where it should be is when it is obvious a hidden camera was used; this never detracts from the show.  For the most part, this looks great.

AUDIO - The audio is also very good quality, but is only presented in Dolby Stereo.  Balance can also be an issue, as voices can be too loud and everything else is too soft.  Again, this doesn't really detract from the show, but it is an issue.

EXTRAS - The extras really shine - here you have all 10 of the characters' audition tapes, including pre-show interviews.  You really get to know the characters better and see what they are like out of the show.  Next, there are 6 deleted scenes, which show the characters relaxing and being themselves; they are quite entertaining.  Finally, you have the post-execution reactions.  They last awhile and show you more in-depth how the executions affected the remaining characters.

All in all, this is a great DVD presentation of an excellent show.",1112313600,13,1440,4.552529182879377
2211548,5,B0007GAEXK,"The ""civilian"" version of the Mole blows away the Celebrity version.  Why should I care about celebrities playing the Mole?  It's so much better to watch people who are more like us.  This is the best reality show in reality show history, in my opinion.  Anderson Cooper is a great host, even better in season 2.  His wit greatly compliments the happenings on the show, subtlely taunting the contestants and adding humor to the show.  I only hope that Eagle Vision releases season 2 on DVD, too.  I will certainly buy that.",1111622400,8,523,4.619565217391305
2211549,5,B0007GAEXK,"It's finally happening, we get a chance to watch the episodes without having to tape them!  This show excels at keeping you guessing.  The premise is similar to Clue (who dun it) and if you give it the time of day, you'll get addicted instantly.  I suggest starting out with a suspect in your mind, then alter it throughout!

  Enjoy this DVD! I know I will!",1111190400,4,358,4.348484848484849
2211550,5,B0007GAEXK,"The Mole is hands-down the classiest of all reality TV shows, and it's great to see the first season of this fantastic show issued on DVD.  The game itself is brilliant, consisting of a group of individuals with a saboteur among them.  The goal is to identify The Mole and complete various challenges, earning money for a group jackpot along the way.  Of course the Mole is there to sabotage the challenges and to keep money from accumulating in the jackpot.  The contestants take a quiz at the end of each round, based on their observations and who they feel the Mole is.  Whoever answers the fewest questions correctly is ""executed"".  This continues round by round until three players remain for the final round:  the winner, the runner-up and The Mole.  A major factor of the game is the trust level among the contestants, many of whom try to cast suspicion upon themselves in order to throw the other competitors off.  The challenges are ingenious, the contestants are cool people who enjoy each other's company for the most part (you won't find any ""I wouldn't give you water if you were dying in the desert"" drama here, folks!) and Anderson Cooper is a class act as the host.  What also elevates this show above the reality TV pack is that the contestants ultimately determine their own fate; they may build coalitions to share information as the game progresses, but their knowledge (or lack thereof) of who the Mole is  determines whether they remain in the game or not (as opposed to the backstabbing and the duplicity of the ""popularity contests"" that are prevalent in virtually every other reality show).  The Mole also features a standout musical score, which fits the show perfectly (see my review for The Mole soundtrack CD).  Add to that the lush photography, picturesque locations, the ""strangers in a strange land"" element (language barriers, culture clashes, etc.) and the chance to guess along with the players and the end result is a fun, intriguing and sophisticated show that the whole family can enjoy.  The entire season is here, and the extras (including deleted scenes, post-execution reactions and audition tapes and casting interviews) are great too.  Unfortunately ABC-TV didn't realize what they had with The Mole, and their virtual lack of marketing and promotion of the show led to its demise, which is truly a shame.  Hopefully another network will rediscover this show for the gem that it is, and we can all look forward to The Return of The Mole (and, dare we dream, the return of Anderson Cooper) sometime soon... I'm chomping at the bit to audition for it when it happens!",1110499200,12,2609,4.816143497757848
2211551,5,B0007GAEXK,When I saw that The Mole 1 was coming out I jumped for joy. This is the best reality show ever made! I only wish they would make more of it. This version of The Mole is a 100 times better than the celebrity editions. This show really makes you think. Even the price is great. Don't miss out on The Mole. Hope they release The Mole 2-The Next Betrayel on DVD too. Until then watch The Mole 1!,1109894400,8,391,3.962025316455696

8047169,4,B0007GAEXK,"This reality television show has a different spin than any other. 10 contestants are brought to play the game. However, one of them is actually a mole, a saboteur. Their job is to hinder the group's success in winning challenges, which will hinder how much money they make. The goal of the game is to raise as much money as you can and uncover the mole.
This show is styled with the classic spy/film noir movie genre. The whole thing is one long mystery and the show uses fingerprints and tough puzzles to keep that theme alive. It's a different type of show but I'm not surprised it only had 5 seasons. It's good but it's missing something.",1435449600,,641,4.440677966101695

The strategery and the game-play that went on was brilliant on the part of two players specifically and it's the best game-play that I've ever seen on this show. I really wish that the US would have embraced this show because I've had to resort to foreign versions in order to watch more. It's just so brilliant. This is the best season, but season 2 is also great, and season 5 is pretty good. I could take or leave the two in-between.

As a side note, if you haven't seen this show, don't look at the product details because it does kinda reveal the identity of the mole. Not blatantly, but it does subconsciously indicate the identity.",1427500800,,694,4.552
