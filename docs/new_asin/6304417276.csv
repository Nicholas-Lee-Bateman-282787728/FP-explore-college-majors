A lot of modern day strip clubs are so dark that nobody can see anything. I used to say when I went to strip clubs that one of my greatest joys in life was examining the skin of women, but that joy has been taken away from me; and I said that because strip clubs used to have more light (like in Strip Search Backstage), but now it was so dark that a person can't examine the skin of women.
  Playboy thinks women with fake tits are so hot, and we get a few of those in this DVD, as well as natural personnel. Playboy has the notion that women go outside in a bikini and get sunburned like crazy and get tanned, and it's supposed to be soooo sexy to see the white parts of them where their bikini tops and bottoms used to be. Playboy lays the tan-white-parts thing on pretty thick in this DVD, but I think young women should be encouraged to wear sunscreen, for tanning and getting a sunburn damages the skin and leads to premature aging of the skin.
  Speaking of clubs being so dark, I was in a real strip club once, and it was so dark that nobody could see anything, but I noticed the DJ was using a flashlight at the DJ booth to see something, probably to read the label on a CD, or whatever; and I went up to him and told him that it's cheating that he would be able to use a flashlight to see anything, and he should just sit around in the dark and suffer like the rest of us.
  The notion of having to use a flashlight to see anything is actually a part of this DVD, as one of the clubs has a Flashlight Dance, where everybody sits around in the dark and each person shines a flashlight on the dancer so that they can see anything.
 One part of this DVD that other reviewers seem to like is when the DVD shows guys getting private dances at the Venus Club in Miami, for the club (and undoubtedly the city of Miami) allow people to touch the dancers so much.
  This DVD is a must-have for afficianodos of the genre of strippers & strip clubs. That doesn't especially mean that I love this DVD that much, but I do praise this DVD for being very realistic and accurate and technically very well done.
  I just wish that Playboy could've used more editorial discretion with glorifying females with fake tits so much, and I think Playboy could be a better role model and stop acting like it's sooo sexy to see this tan-white-parts thing. Maybe the Playboy crew could hand out free bottles of sunscreen the next time they visit a strip club.",1208131200,2,2548,4.211498973305955
7870524,4,6304417276,"I agree with the November 18, 1999 review. This video does start out slow, but it gets better.
The people that put this video together made a big mistake. The vignette featuring the strip club ""Mons Venus"",  should've been the last vignette, because that was the best one! After  watching that one, I found the other vignettes to be boring. They were  still hot, but they were boring in comparison. I would've found the other  vignettes to be even hotter, if ""Mons Venus"" was shown last. The  last two vignettes that should have shown (in order), are ""Runway  66"" and ""Mons Venus"". They were simply the best.
What I  didn't like about this video was that the pictures shown at the back of the  video's cover, were not in the video. Since everyone expects the pictures  they find on the back of video covers to be on the videos they buy (after  all, this helps us decide whether to buy the video or not), Playboy  should've followed the principle of putting only pictures that people will  find on the video itself.",964051200,7,1014,4.541436464088398
