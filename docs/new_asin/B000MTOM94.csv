2748396,5,B000MTOM94,"THIS IS THE BEST YU-GI-OH! SEASON OUT OF ALL OF THEM PUT TOGETHER!!  All your favorites are here...AND Pharaoh AKA Yami Yugi has a new image as well as
""the Evil Bakura"" AKA Yami Bakura in which Yami Bakura  TRULY IS A THIEF AS HE MENTIONED COUNTLESS TIMES PLUS HE IS EXTREMELY SICK-MINDED.  I am a HUGE fan of Yami Bakura AND ""the good Bakura""(In the ORIGINAL Japanese episodes by the name of ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"",""the good Bakura"" is refered to the name,Ryou Bakura as this series is known as none other than ""Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duel Monsters"")but one can only help but wonder what would happen IF
Yami Bakura were to ACTUALLY succeed in defeating the Pharaoh?  Anyways,this season called
""Yu-Gi-Oh!: Dawn Of The Duel"" has by far the most action but has a story to it as well as a mission but NOT with cards,mind you.  I can't tell you anymore than what I have revealed but Part 2 has the FINAL episode but I'm warning you to have a box of Kleenex ready for a heartbreaking moment for ALL of them...ESPECIALLY YUGI!!
Perhaps I've said too much but just wait and see what I mean...need I say more?  *Ryou Bakura Girl*  --J.Allen--",1191801600,,1114,4.512437810945274
2748397,5,B000MTOM94,"I'm glad that Dawn of the Duel is finally out on dvd, but I've been wondering about when the rest of Waking the Dragons comes out on dvd. Will they start with volume 3 since volumes 1 & 2 are already out or will they have all of the episodes from Waking the Dragons in a dvd box set like the Grand Championship & Dawn of the Duel Saga?",1180915200,,335,3.869565217391304
2748398,5,B000MTOM94,"That is so awesome that Dawn of the Duel is finally going to be released.  From what I heard, the rest of the waking the dragons dvds will be produced follwing the completeion of dawn of the duel.",1174521600,5,196,4.157894736842105
2748399,5,B000MTOM94,"Finally the are going to release the season 5 dawn of the duel. Actually in this dvd you are going to find out about pharaohs past and the reason why pharaoh chose yu gi as a part of him ( this clue comes out from the next dvd, part 2 ). All the best charachters are included in this season ( all the Yamis, yu gi, bakura and marik ). Its very amusing season and i think is the best of all i have seen by now. If you didn't like the last yu gi oh season 5 dvd, well you have your chance with this one. I reccomend it for you to buy it. I also recomend you to buy the next yu gi oh dvd season5 part 2, just to coplete your entire set.",1174176000,5,633,3.661764705882353

8172296,4,B000MTOM94,"This is the beginning of the end for Yu-gi-oh. That being said, it is a grand adventure with lots of magic and- yay! less dueling. The dub is well done in some ways but is lacking in others.

The Plot:

8/10. This is based on Yu-gi-oh  Manga volumes 1-5 in the Memory World saga. However, the plot is different in a few ways, mainly involving Bobasa's role and Seto's backstory. The modern Kaiba also tags along in the anime version. The plot is not as well flowing as the manga, but still well done.

The characters and voice acting:

9/10 . All character's voice acting are well done, although some are annoying. (Tea, Mana, Bobasa) The most well-portrayed character is Bakura, Ted Lewis does an very good job here, and is in character the entire time. However, it gets very mellow-dramatic when Atem says ""The fate of the world depends on it"" 900,000,000 times.

The Dubbing job:

4/10. I am sorry, but should people really accept the whole ""Shadow Realm"" excuse for death? It is silly and overused. Characters should die and they do not need to remove any hints of violence. In the movie ""The Lion King"", Scar and Mufasa die, yet in this TV show, people can't seem to say the word ""killed"". Why do they think Yanks can't cope with dark storylines?

Value:

1/10. Does this DVD need to be $100-$200? REALLY? You can watch it on Hulu for FREE!

Overall:

 8/10. Let's say I'm being nice here. I am overlooking serious faults here. However, I feel unless the price goes WAYYY down, you should just watch this on Hulu.",1322438400,2,1518,4.52014652014652
8172297,5,B000MTOM94,Purchased as a gift for my teenage son who is collecting all Yu GI Oh seasons - great value for the price!,1304380800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8172298,5,B000MTOM94,"Journey back to ancient Egypt where the Pharaoh must lock the Shadow Games away forever once again. The darkness that corrupted Egypt five thousand years ago will reawaken & take its revenge against mankind once again. Now the Pharaoh & his friends must stop this evil before the world is tainted by the Shadow Games. The storyline is about the Pharaoh reliving his ancient past & repeating his heroic victory over the Shadow Games just like he did five thousand years ago before. The plot is filled with even more danger & destruction due to the magnitude of the Shadow Games dark powers. The speed of the plot's progression is quite fast & fits well with the amount of epic action from the storyline.
The voice acting is very good in portraying the worries & fears of the characters. The dialogue between the characters is well developed & delivered effectively.
I recommend this anime to the fans of the YuGiOh anime series.
Thank you.",1287100800,,938,4.725609756097561
