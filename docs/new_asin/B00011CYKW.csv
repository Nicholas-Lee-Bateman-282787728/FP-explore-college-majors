8005093,1,B00011CYKW,"I really don't know what to say, other than this Armada garbage really sucks.
I started to follow the Transformers mythos in 1984, and have enjoyed every series I've come apon. Be it the original Transformers, Scramble City, Head Masters, Master Force, Victory, Zone, Beast Wars and Beast Machines. Well, that's not the case with this Armada crap. I don't know where to begin a list of everything that's wrong with this abomination.
Mixing cell animation with CGI animation and effects is a bad start and garantees that ""cheap aesthetic"" that we keep seeing more and more of these days. The characters are annoying at best (those that have some sort of hint of a personality anyway)and the writing is embarassingly bad.
As some other reviewer has stated, the human characters in this crap fest are particulally revolting. There's actually this fat kid in the group who goes on about being hungry all the time. The only lines he ever says during an episode are ""I'm SOOO hungry"" or ""Who wants waffles"" or something else to that effect. Yes people, the writing is THAT BAD.
Bland writing and bland voice acting, combined with repetitive CGI polluted animation and bad techno music would be the only words that come to mind if I were to describe this pathetic incarnation of my beloved Transformers.
I'm giving this Rhino release 1 star, because at least the disc itself played correctly on my DVD player.
Yuck!",1099699200,,1408,4.822314049586777
8005094,1,B00011CYKW,"As an avid Generation 1 Transformers fan I must say that I am extremely disappointed with Armada and its successor Energon and must fully concur with all of the reviewers who have written prior to this entry.

Armada and Energon's plot are terrible at best.  This is the first time since I watched Generation 1 and Beast Wars that I hoped that the Decepticons would destroy and obliterate the Autobots and their human sidekicks.
The humans in Armada and Energon are annoying and hold no special purpose.  In comparison, Spike, Sparkplug and Chip from Generation 1 were not put in every episode in an attempt to try to help the Autobots.  In many episodes in Generation 1, we did not see any human counterparts that played a pivotal part in deciding the victor of the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons.  However, in Armada and Energon the Autobots cannot win without their human companions.
I disagree somewhat with the voice casting in Armada and Energon.  In Generation 1 we had great voice actors for the Autobots and Decepticons.  For example, Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, Chris Latta, Neil Ross, Michael Bell, Scatman Caruthers, Casey Kasem and other greats portrayed my heros that I have watched growing up.  In Armada, I am pleased with the voice casting of Megatron (David Kayle), Optimus Prime (Gary Chalk), Hot Shot, Starscream, and Demolisher.  Mr. Kayle has done an extremely wonderful job since he started with Megatron back in Beast Wars and the same complement is extended to Mr. Chalk, but the other voices are sub par at best. For example, Ironhide in Energon sounds like Carlos...ridiculous.

Real Transformers should be ashamed of the latest incarnations of the Transformers story line.  I have not seen a suitable Transformers story since Beast Wars and Beast Machines and odds are that I never will again.
Now to the DVD review, first off I would like to congratulate Rhino for releasing box sets of Transformers Generation 1, Jem, and G.I. Joe.  However, they completely destroyed the credibility of the Armada DVD's such as this release.  For one, the DVD jumps from one episode to the next as opposed to going through the episodes in a sequential order, not that it would matter to me what order they put the episodes in because they were all bad.
In conclusion, the best thing about the Armada release is the cheap price.  This DVD is selling for a cheap price because the Armada and Energon television show is a cheap product.
To the executives at Rhino STOP releasing Armada and Energon DVD's and release Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light also done by our friends at Sunbow and contains the same voice actors and writers who appeared in Generation 1 Transformers, Jem and G.I. Joe.  Rhino please complete the Sunbow dynasty.",1089676800,,2767,4.869936034115138

8005096,1,B00011CYKW,"I am a big transformers fan.  I've been following the Transformers since Generation 1.  I am a decent Transformers collectors too.  In fact, I own more than 60 bots and all videos that are available on DVD.  However, I have to say this one is REALLY horrible.
This DVD includes 4 Armada episodes:
  * Metamorphosis (Episode 2)
  * Base (Episode 3)
  * Confrontation (Episode 9)
  * Decisive Battle (Episode 21)
First, in most people's opinion, Armada is THE worst Transformers series.  The story line is dull and the character deisngs are also bad.  However, I saw many, if not all, Armada episodes before I bought this DVD, so I kind of expected this.
Then, it comes the REAL problems of the DVD: the sequence of the episodes and the selection of the episodes.
The sequence is extremely odd.  Well, what IS the sequence?  It is NOT the first 4 episodes of the Armada series, instead, it contains episodes 2, 3, 9, and 21.  It seems like these four episodes are just chosen by random.  At least, I couldn't find out the correlations between them.
The selection is also very weird.  In the TV series, episodes 1 - 3 was a mini-series.  However, the disk only contains episodes 2 and 3.  So the story starts without a real beginning.  In fact, if you have never seen Armada before, you will be wondering what's going on.  Well, the story line should be easy enough to figure out, but you'll still lose a lot of the story line.
I bought the DVD only for the sake of having a completed Transformers DVD collection.  I really hope Rhino releases some sort of boxed set which is a REAL collection.  As of now, buy it ONLY if you are a HUGE fan and want to keep your collection completed.  After all, you should be able to get it between $8 - $9, it may not a big deal to waste the money just to keep the collection completed.  Otherwise, forget about this one.",1087603200,5,1854,4.408284023668639
8005097,2,B00011CYKW,"Aramda season one sucked!!!! the series only got good during the end of the second season,I probebly will end up getting the box set but other than that I won't buy this single disc...if you like annoying BRATS standing around watching robots barely hitting each other thanks to political correctness then you would like this disc that doesn't even go anywhere..4 episodes that tell the same story get's kind of dull after awhile if you like gen1 and beastwars you'll hate this one,except the second season...stay away from this and get the box set when it's released..",1081468800,,569,4.876288659793815
