8075734,5,B000A7JKNG,"This is an insightful, multiple award winning documentary about the dreaded forced labor camp operated in the 1950s Hungary. This is not a movie as stated by the previous reviewer, it is an excellent documentary made during the communist era (filmed in secret). The filmmakers interviewed both survivors and the captors equally showing both side of the coin. It is a must see for history buffs. The doc provides a very accurate description of camp life without any biases. Interestingly one of the two directors of the documentary also happens to be a survivor of the Recsk camp. There is a good companion movie made by the other director, which shows an escape attempt from the camp (Escape from Recsk). Maybe the previous reviewer was referring to that film, however, I must say that movie is pretty dam accurate too, given that it was written and produced by the same director who survived the camp. Can get more accurate than that!",1416182400,,935,4.813664596273292
