8381546,1,B002UTNJSY,"This is a fraud. I'ts not Tito Puente Last Concert. His Last Concert was with Orquesta Sinfnica de Puerto Rico at ""Teatro de la Unversidad de Puerto Rico""  The producer stole the cover picture from my site and it's been prosecuted. Don't buy this.",1425686400,2,247,4.613636363636363

8381548,1,B002UTNJSY,"I feel deceived! The cover says ""The Last Concert...Collector's Edition"" and it has a picture of Tito Puente which made me believe I was buying the last taped concert performance of the maestro and his orchestra. Even the picture on the cover is misleading as it is not from the performance in this DVD but rather from a much earlier time in which Tito was still youthful, vibrant and fun to watch.

It made me sad to see him play two (2) short opening tunes only to disapear for 75 to 80 minutes and return to the stage at the very end for the tired ""Oye Como Va"". The 75-80 minutes in between were filled with a bunch of UNremarkable unknowns. The lighting in the theater is poor and as a result, the picture on your TV will appear dim. You will need to adjust for brightness. The sound quality also leaves something to be desired. I could not get a satisfying sound through my Dolby surround sound system.

Total time of this DVD is 90:18...an hour and a half which does nothing to remind his fans of the great history-making musician he was.

To put this in perspective, the performance on this DVD was recorded on 04/19/2000 and only six (6) weeks later - 06/01/2000 - the man had died. I don't mean to be unkind but there are moments in which he appears to be disoriented and generally not healthy-looking in this, his last performance (not last CONCERT as the title falsly states). In my opinion, this was a disservice to the enduring legend of Tito Puente.",1341532800,9,1464,4.434944237918216
