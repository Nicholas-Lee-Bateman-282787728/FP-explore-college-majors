8286841,5,B001CD6FRG,"Great lower budget movie and has a singer who grew up in my area, Ken Medema, featured in it. Great storyline and not predictable. Nor is it overly preachy. Definitely will be watching this movie again.",1364083200,,202,4.638888888888889
8286842,5,B001CD6FRG,"This movie is production wise like a low budget tv show, but it makes up for it in the story line.  It will make you laugh and cry.  The message is powerful and the acting is pretty good.  Just a good funny movie without all the four letter words.",1350259200,,247,4.0
8286843,5,B001CD6FRG,"This movie was EXCELLENT! The story was well written, the characters were quite believable, but most importantly, this movie really speaks to you! So many of us grew up in the church, and heard the same cliche sermon week after week after week. But how many of us really know a guy like Floyd. Someone who will come into our homes and speak to us just as we are. This movie taught me that as a Christian, it's not always about being able to speak to people, but sometimes listening is all they need. When you formulate a sermon based on what you know, the only person you're serving is yourself. But when you take the time to hear what the other person is going through, God can come in and give you the right words to say!
This movie truly proves that the church is not a building you go to on Sundays, but the people that God has chosen to put into your life to share his message of love. Floyd and the other characters in this movie really remind us that ""where two or more have gathered... there will God be"".",1250208000,,1013,4.22680412371134
8286844,4,B001CD6FRG,"I just watched this movie, and came away surprised that I had never heard of it before. It is well written, well acted, and uses both laughter and tears to create an engaging story that is delightful.

At times, the different twists, turns and seeming incongruence in the story left me a little lost, but in the end the movie proved very satisfying.

The film is especially good for those who love the Body of Christ, but are discouraged about what they see happening in their local church, or churches in their area.

The film does not tie up all of the ends neatly, and easily gives fodder for discussions. It is not a perfect movie, but is definitely one of the more enjoyable newer Christian movies I've seen. Sometimes the music style is 'outdated' but if you look beyond that, the meaning is there.

I recommend this movie heartily.",1201305600,5,838,4.566666666666666
