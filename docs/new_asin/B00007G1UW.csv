1808870,3,B00007G1UW,"We bought this one out of desperation for something new in the Elmo repetoire, since our little 20-month old thinks Elmo is the greatest thing since his Daddy.  He loves it, but it may be one of the ones a grown-up can tolerate least.  Discuesses shoes, jackets, hats...YOu have not really reach your limit with Elmo until you put up with Jacket and Jill jokes.  One real complaint though...Elmo tells kids that when a jacquet is dirty, it goes into the washing machine.  Try that at home with Mommy or Daddy's leather jacket!!!!
So, why three stars?...four from my kid, two from me!",1044835200,6,583,4.631067961165049
1808871,3,B00007G1UW,"The three Elmo's World episodes (Hats, Jackets and Shoes)collected here are not among the most entertaining for kids or adults. Most of the other collections in this series have two good and one so-so episode on them. These three are really the bottom of the barrel, particularly in ""Jackets"" you can tell the writers had run out of ideas. Nevertheless it remains educational and my toddler enjoys it occasionally in rotation with his other videos in the series...",1044576000,6,464,4.961538461538462
1808872,3,B00007G1UW,My son LOVES Elmo and when I picked this up I'd thought he'd really enjoy it because he's obsessed with HATS!  He did enjoy the hat segment but didn't seem as interested in the shoes or jackets as much.  I'll still go back to Wild Wild West anyday!,1044057600,,248,4.145833333333333
1808912,5,B00007G1UW,"As always, Elmo keeps my kids' attention. They are 4 and 2. This is very educational. Elmo is my favorite babysitter!",1265414400,,117,4.619047619047619
1808913,5,B00007G1UW,"The item arrived in a short amount of time, and just as described in the seller's description.",1255996800,,94,4.588235294117647
1808914,4,B00007G1UW,"This one is not the best in the Elmo's World series, but I just can't get myself to give Elmo a lower star rating. I have purchased most of the ""Elmo's World"" DVDs for my toddler, who is three years if age. He loves Elmo and counts and sings along with him during the video. I think that  Elmo's songs could be a little more inventive, (when Elmo sits at his piano and just repeats the same word over and over I think it's odd--couldn't anyone write a chorus?) but that is my only complaint. Good, safe entertainment for toddlers is hard to find.",1245628800,,546,4.25
1808915,1,B00007G1UW,I am very disappointed. I purchased this product 2/28/09 and never received it. I will not do business again with this company. I gave it one star but it deserves none and should not be allowed a place at Amazon.com.,1238457600,,216,4.425
1808916,5,B00007G1UW,Elmo is very funny. Baby loves it and I have to say that Elmo character makes some comments and jokes that only an adult would understand. I find him very entertaining compared to Barney and Tellitubies. I would pick watching Elmo anyday over the other children DVDs.,1214006400,,267,4.702127659574468
1808917,3,B00007G1UW,"OK OK OK, Elmo is slowly growing on me also and my daughter really likes his DVD's. This is the usual stuff. Kids will love it but it still lacks the appeal of older Sesame Street stuff.",1166832000,2,186,4.054054054054054
1808918,3,B00007G1UW,"I would rate this the least interesting Elmo DVD - it has a slow pace, and it's all about similar topics (clothing items).  Our two year old - who loves Elmo - actually yawns during this one.  The only amusing part is about shoes.  Pass on this one if you have a choice!",1088985600,15,270,4.056603773584905
1808919,5,B00007G1UW,"When I saw some of the other reviews for this dvd, I was a little surprised.  We bought this one for our 20 month-old daughter, and it immediately went into our rotation of Elmo videos.  She loves it just as much as the other ones.  In fact, this was the first one that she started to sing along with Elmo.  She became engaged with the familiar objects.  To be honest, I don't think any of the Elmo segments are particularly tolerable to adults, and this one didn't bother me any more than any of the others.  My daughter loves Elmo, and finds something fascinating in all the segments.  And I can let her watch without worrying about violence, language, or content.  That's the important thing.  So, if your looking to add some ""new"" Elmo to your video library, then this one will fill the bill.",1084838400,17,796,4.43448275862069
1808920,4,B00007G1UW,"I was skeptical about ordering this DVD because most of the reviews were not overwhelmingly positive.  I just wanted to write that it is worth the reasonable price.  Both of my children enjoy this DVD, and they have been having fun wearing their jackets, hats and shoes since they watched it.  I therefore would definitely recommend this DVD.",1048982400,9,342,4.862068965517241

7976078,5,B00007G1UW,My Granddaughter loves Elmo! She finds the DVD entertaining and watches it regularly. DVD itself was in great shape and plays perfectly.,1494201600,,136,5.2272727272727275
7976079,5,B00007G1UW,Bought this on a price drop for only $5.  Was a great addition to a Christmas gift for our 1 year old nephew.,1482883200,,109,3.739130434782609

7976081,5,B00007G1UW,"Super cute, great way to teach about getting dressed, and Mr. Noodles' skit in here makes my kid giggle like crazy. Its pretty funny. We love all of the Elmo's World videos and this is no exception.",1445817600,,198,4.378378378378378
7976082,5,B00007G1UW,Exactly what I expected & my twin grandchilden can't stoo watching. Well made as all Sesame St movies are in content.,1427414400,,117,4.619047619047619
7976083,5,B00007G1UW,I am a homeschool teacher and my preschool students love it.  It's entertaining and informative too.,1425686400,,100,5.25

7976085,5,B00007G1UW,"My daughter loves it. The silly Mr Noodle alway makes her giggle. And she talked with kids in the DVD to help silly Mr Noodle to do the right way. At two, she already learned how to put jackets, pants, shoes and so on from this video. Good job. High Five.",1346198400,,255,4.019607843137255
7976086,4,B00007G1UW,"I purchased this video for circle time with my ABA group. I like the video, but would skip parts with Mr. Noodle so that kids don't get confused as to how to put on jacket, hat or shoes. They love elmo though!",1293148800,,209,4.0
