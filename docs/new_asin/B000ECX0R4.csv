2516128,2,B000ECX0R4,"I guess the best thing you can say about this film is that it gives the audience a sense of what gay life must have been like prior to the aids epedemic.

The acting is not very good, the editing is terrible, the film quality is poor and the sound is bad.

The best aspect of the film is the feature debut of Jane Olivor who sings a great rendition of ""Pretty Girl""  It is great to see her in performance from her early days in the business.  Sometimes, however, the movement of her mouth and the sound of the film do not match.

I also enjoyed the drag show with Diana Ross and Judy Garland.

All in all, not a great movie, but its less than 90 minutes long so its worth a viewing....",1143590400,20,685,4.037037037037037

2516137,3,B000ECX0R4,The movie is quite dated. I was a young middle aged person who had just come out and visited the Ansonia frequently. I think the emphasis on presenting the gay community as predominantly comprised mainly of raging queens is very misleading about the gay community then and now. The main story about an anti-gay protagonist who converts to bi-sexuality is not fully believable.

By way of acting, script and production ""Saturday Night at the Baths"" is pretty bad. The basic story line revolves around the protagonist's struggle with coming out as a gay man. He's soft on the eyes but otherwise amateur as an actor.

What is of interest is the fact that the movie was filmed on location at the Continental Baths, serving as a time capsule of a time and place in gay life before the scourge of AIDS and the mainstreaming of LGBT life.",1472947200,,715,4.578125

At least there's not a tragic ending, like so many gay films of the past. The sad part is: There is no happy ending, either. In fact...there's NO ending! The film just...stops, mid-dialogue, and the credits roll. Maybe they ran out of money.

A very good reason to see this anyway, is so one can better comprehend just how FAR gay cinema has come since this was made, and gain a new appreciation for such labors of love. Good or bad, happy or sad--every effort pushes us forward.

2516169,3,B000ECX0R4,"The 1970s produced a lot of low-budget films like these that were shown in drive-in theaters and regular theaters as part of a double or triple-feature line-up. Saturday Night At The Baths had the look and feel of those movies. Back in the 1970s, I used to go to drive-ins for these cheap triple features (and I actually watched the movies!) Some were groundbreaking like this one and surprisingly good; others were real duds. Because they were independently produced and low budget, these films were free to explore taboo topics that mainstream films were reluctant to take on. Other similar films of the same vintage exploring the LGBT topic was Gemini Affair(1974) and  Just The Two of Us (1975), both available on Amazon.

When I had purchased and reviewed The Ritz, I noticed that Amazon had recommended this film to buy, so I was curious to view it.
Saturday Night At The Baths is very gay-positive, although it was rather campy and overacted at times. Some scenes were so drawn-out that I would fast-forward them, so it could have used a good film editor. It was very low budget, so low budget that one of the actors in an early scene has acne cysts all over his face that were not covered by makeup. In another scene, you can hear kids/people talking in the apartment next door; the director had filmed the scene in an actual apartment and didn't have the budget (or technology) to mask the voices.

When watching Saturday Night At The Baths there was very little to indicate the movie took place in the Continental Baths, which was disappointing. From a historical viewpoint, I was curious to see what this place was like, especially since the Divine Miss M with her accompianist Barry Manilow had once performed there. The so-called scenes in the bathhouse were mainly in its lounge/disco, where both men and women were in attendance. Compared with ""The Ritz, the viewer clearly knows the movie is set in a gay bathhouse and interestingly, women were not allowed in, save for Googie Gomez the lounge singer and Maurine the accountant. I always thought gay bathhouses served an exclusively gay male clientele and was surprised to learn that women and straight people were allowed in the Continental Baths.

I loved the campy floor show with the male dancers in white, along with the female impersonators. I thought the female impersonators were quite good for the era; Shirley Bassey has me fooled completelyI was wondering how a low-budget flick could have afforded Ms Basseys services, until Carmen Miranda appeared and thats when I realized these were female impersonators. The one impersonating Judy Garland looked quite like the Judy of the late 1960s.

Typical of these low-budget 1970s films were to show long, gratuitous sex scenes and lots of casual nudity in order to attract audiences. This one has a long sex scene between the pianist Michael and his live-in girlfriend Tracy.  For a film that I thought was aimed at gay male audiences, I was surprised to see this. It appears this film was still somewhat pandering to straight audiences, though straight males in the audience would have had to be very open-minded (or stoned) to watch the gay love scenes.

The love scenes between Michael and Scotti were tastefully done; there was more tenderness and love between those two characters as opposed to the earlier one between Michael and Tracy. For those who like more explicit sex, this film might be too tame. The football game was funny, with the gay team camping it up to unnerve their straight butch opponents.

While dated, this film does offer a fascinating slice of 1970s gay life in the pre-AIDS days, so it has a definite place in the history of gay cinema. It is an interesting artifact and for those who lived in the 1970s and patronized the Continental Baths or similar places, this film is a fond reminder of a bygone era of a more open, carefree time.",1466726400,,3886,4.78955223880597

Its worth noting that Bette Midler got her start performing at bathhouses. I gave the movie an extra star because it was nice to see sex scenes portrayed honestly.

2516233,3,B000ECX0R4,"""Saturday Night at the Baths"" was made in the early '70s. It isn't a very good movie - it's dated, and the acting is pretty stilted. But I kind of liked it. It has a sexy vibe, the cast is attractive, and it has its funny moments. People from other generations might think of the '70s as decadent, but this movie reveals the almost innocent enthusiasm of sexually liberated people of that time. They really believed that sex was a good thing, and that more sex was even better. The movie also kind of works as a document of New York City in those post-hippie, pre-AIDS, pre-Reagan days: the awful clothes; a casual bisexual threesome; the old Times Square vaudeville houses that showed porn and second-run movies; the Meat Packing District before it became chic; bathhouse hookups; and a heavily made-up young Jane Olivor at the Continental Baths, singing for towel-wrapped young men who lounged by the pool, while well-dressed customers sat ringside at cocktail tables.

2516244,2,B000ECX0R4,"If you were a gay man and lived through the 1970s, you would be aware that disco music ruled the airwaves. You would also know that bathhouses were common meeting places for gay men.

This film is of that era and focuses on a man named Michael who is a pianist. He lives with a woman named Tracy. They have a carefree relationship living in a huge apartment in Soho. Tracy is apparently a photographer and Michael soon lands a job as a pianist at a popular bathhouse. He soon meets Scotti, who quickly becomes infatuated with him, even though Michael indicates clearly that he is straight.

This is the set-up for this film. It is fairly obvious that somehow Michael and Scotti will ""get together."" And that is what happens. It's not any big drama. As such, it's hard to invest in this film emotionally.

Although it is set up fairly well, it then devolves into several bizarre set pieces, including a ""gay/straight"" football game in the park, and en endless cabaret show with female impersonators, with casual shots of men soaping each other up in the ""baths"" and women jumping into some kind of pool. Neither of these set pieces have any impact on the story.

There is also a short sequence with Jane Olivor singing a song she apparently wrote, ""Pretty Girl."" Again, for gay men in particular, Jane Olivor was about as close to Streisand as they were ever going to get. And although she eventually had some success, she never became the diva that she could have. But in this movie, you can get a taste of her greatness, even if her greatness is taking place in an unusual setting. (Mind you, Bette Midler also kickstarted her career by appearing in a gay bathhouse.)

As for character development: Tracy seems to get super upset at Michael because he says that Scotti isn't ""normal."" She essentially shames him into apologizing to Scotti, which leads to a big ""confession"" about his past, his father... ad nauseam.

As a ""time capsule"" experience, the film is interesting. You can get a handle on fashion, hairstyles, music and slang.  Other than that, I'm sorry, this film does not have much going for it.",1442534400,,2108,4.6353887399463805

Otherwise, if you have an interest in this period and what it was like to be in a time of uninhibited sexual exploration, there are some scenes and sociology of the period presented here that are tantamount to a documentary. Take-in Jane Olivor's touching performance and the broadway entertainment at the baths during that time and you will know why this period was so special.  The diversity of the people and the freedom of expression makes this film a gem! It is like a time capsule. The mores (pronounced ""morays"" in this context), are also spot-on. The 70's were so free, the music was amazing and the openness of sexual expression and honesty, though a bit over the top, was totally refreshing, fun and educational. The relationship of our protagonist with this girlfriend and her openness and acceptance of her boyfriend's untapped interest in having sex with a guy, is totally mature and somewhat typical of the time. Folks were exploring and discovering and not so freaked-out by sexual behaviors that  emerged all along the continuum of rational self-expression. The music was as interesting as the story. We hear an arrangement of Satie's Gymnopedies in the background in many scenes, but also the drumbeat of disco as well. Granted, the acting is a bit stiff and even corny, but it is sincere and honest.  So glad Amazon has this film in its catalog. Enjoy!",1440374400,3,1457,4.796812749003984

2516273,3,B000ECX0R4,"After watching this movie, I was surprised by the low ratings it received. The acting by the main characters was better than expected. In spots, quite good. The story itself - a bit underwhelming. On the technical side, I wasn't expecting much given the reviews, but it really wasn't all that bad. This afterall, is a seventies independent film. Making films back then must have been quite a bit more expensive and challenging, so hats off to the people who produced it.

What I really wanted to see was New York City in the 70's, and the pre-AIDS gay scene in particular. The Baths are, of course, an iconic feature of that time, so I was hoping to get a good sense of the place, in the way that the movie ""54, The Director's Cut"" gives you a feeling for that nightclub in the same era. Unfortunately, after watching the movie, I don't really feel like I know what it was like to visit the Baths.

The scene with the impersonators (I don't know or care what the PC word is) was fun, and they were better than good, but overall, I didn't get the feeling that this was a balls to the wall show that only the gay subculture of the day could produce. The movie felt disjointed at times, and frankly, I could do with less background on why the piano player felt uncomfortable around gay guys. Seriously, I wanted to tell him to just quit already. But maybe that storyline was more relevant in the seventies.

It's hard to be too critical with this film, since it is a bit of a time capsule. So I enjoyed it for what it was, and that's not half bad. Perhaps now that the AIDS era is well behind us - I know, I know, people still get AIDS - this effort might inspire a new film about gay life in late seventies NYC, including the bathhouses.  With all the craziness and danger of that city in the seventies, it had one thing sorely lacking today - an incredible sense of freedom, and joy. I can't imagine anything more joyless than being a young gay guy today on any college campus. The PC dogma, political indoctrination, unisex bathrooms (dear Lord, what gay guy wants girls in their bathroom!) and Hillary buttons. Did they wear Mamie Eisenhower buttons to the Baths in the seventies? I didn't think so. Ugh.",1439856000,6,2205,4.397058823529412

It has a murky, black and pink cover with facing profiles and the title between them in the center.

The first was a chopped-up version released without the director's participation in 2006. Later an uncut version of the movie was found in the director's files and released as ""director's cut"" on a new DVD in 2008. The second DVD not only is a cleaner copy with better video and audio, but it includes several minutes of footage missing from the first DVD.

Most important **BY FAR** is a five-minute love scene between Scotti and Michael that not only balances the earlier scene between Michael and Tracey but blows it clean out of the water. The scene with Tracey is a sex scene; the scene with Scotti is a love scene, infinitely more sensual, passionate, romantic and erotic than the mechanical humping with Tracey. The gay love scene alone kills forever the criticism that this movie is worth watching only for its documenting of a life and a world long gone. It qualifies this as a very good movie in its own right and one of the sexiest gay moves of that or any era.

The new DVD also includes an extensive, fantastic making-of interview with the director David Buckley and a wide-ranging interview with Steve Ostrow, owner of the Baths - both filmed recently - which were not on the first DVD; and a few extra seconds of the magical Jane Olivor performance of ""Pretty Girl"" and of the fabulous Judy impersonator lost from the first DVD.

That's too bad, because producer/director David Buckley created a film that now serves as a historical record of what life was like in the early LGBT community, via New York's famous Continental Baths.
The inclusion of legendary owner Steve Ostroff---as well as using real-life patrons & performers of the baths as extras---in the movie lends it authenticity...especially when we discover he's alive & well and living in Australia in a Special Features documentary-interview.
The three lead characters in the film are given life by three appealing actors: Robert Aberdeen, Ellen Sheppard and newcomer Don Scotti, who forge a unique & touching friendship/relationship through 70's sexual freedom & attitudes.
It's not a perfect film by any means---the editing is choppy and the acting a bit campy at times. But hey, there are not many movies out there chronicling a culture long gone, so this film is really something to treasure. If anything, places like the Continental Baths live on today in spirit in Pride Festivals all over the globe.

Cool to get a glimpse of the Continental, but turn the sound off and FF as much as possible.",1211068800,,327,4.311475409836065
2516297,4,B000ECX0R4,"When I was living is Sydney, Australia, I met my friend Steve Ostrow, who once told me all about his life in NYC and of the Continental Baths he ran, the famous celebrities who had their beginnings there and of the scandals that took place in the good ol' bad ol' days of sex in the 70's.

At the time I heard his stories, I was young and I found them hard to imagine. It all seemed like a good pitch for the play and movie ""The Ritz"", which he told me was actually based on the Continental Baths.

Two decades later, with the advent of the internet, Amazon.com and DVDs, I now have the pleasure of actually watching this movie and seeing it as it all happened so long ago.

I was thrilled to relive those heady, Bohemian, sexy, free, Studio 54 days, filled with fashion, perfume, sex, drugs and Disco, when big cities were populated with the jetset, the young, hip and the beautiful.

Younger, modern audiences may not be able to fully appreciate the nuances of this wonderfully nostalgic memoir, but older audiences who lived through the 70's will appreciate this moment in our social history.

I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed 'The Ritz', '54', 'The last Days of Disco' and films set in that era.

8108391,2,B000ECX0R4,"Its strength is that it offers modern, younger viewers, a glimpse into the past, to a culture that has since died, thanks to the AIDS crisis of the 80s, and now the cruising/hookup apps. It's poorly produced, though, and serves only as a curiosity to the modern LGBT community, and a stroll down memory lane for the community's elders.",1514505600,,335,4.694915254237288

This was a gay world unto its own, like the Roman Empire, never to be duplicated or even exist!  I was lucky to survive this experience.  If you view this film, please watch for this intrinsic value of a world that is gone for ever!!  NJMJr!!.",1504569600,,354,4.4
8108393,4,B000ECX0R4,Early gay film as rough and raw as you might expect. But great footage of Continental Baths and NYC circa 1974. But heartfelt performances and pre-AIDS sexual exuberance make this film a sweet and touching experience.,1495411200,2,217,5.055555555555555
8108394,5,B000ECX0R4,"A piece of history many would prefer to ignore.

It isn't a cookie cutter modern movie with well adjusted folks all around and nary a stereotype to be seen.

It has a lot of nudity. And that includes female nudity.

It doesn't end on a high note. It isn't really about substantive change.

And the ending seems written  just to anger and frustrate modern people.

Avoid if you're put off by sex. Avoid if you can't look at it as what it is, a document of it's time.

I recommend it highly to folks who are in the mood for a love story with complications.",1494633600,2,554,4.219047619047619

It was enlightening to see the attitudes and views of these characters in the time, because this was right before it all fell apart for the Gay community. Having never been to the Continental Baths, it was before my time, it was great to see it. I enjoyed the story, the acting, everything.",1486339200,2,373,4.582089552238806

8108398,3,B000ECX0R4,"My first thought in watching this film was it was both dated and  somewhat offensive. However it might be better thought of as a glimpse of a bygone time, one I am happy to not live through again.

That said it is worth the time to have a glimpse of the Continental Baths.  The stage show toward the end of the movie is an upbeat change from the otherwise serious tenor of the film, and the nebulous ending is refreshingly realistic for both past and present.",1484438400,,459,4.313953488372093
