7922402,4,B00004TBFN,"This film's animation was lacking with the character's facial expressions. However, it worked! I really enjoyed this film. It has a simple, yet charming quality to it. There isn't much said, but it has a beautiful message. The backgrounds are interesting at times, and the characters just look like dolls, but this add's more interest to the film. The only problem is that for the dvd I felt they should have inhanced the color/picture quality. Very faded, and warn looking. The extra feature is a George Pal short of John Henry and the Inky Poo. You can find George Pal on DVD on Amazon.com, and his Puppetoons.
So in the long run I really enjoyed this stop frame animation film.",1299369600,2,680,4.675

7922404,4,B00004TBFN,"This is a review for The Emperor and the Nightingale DVD, mine is a slightly different one. The cover art is the same, but mine contains only the movie plus one short film ""John Henry and the Inky Poo"" (which I believe is a George Pal short, correct me if I'm wrong...) The film, narrated creepily enough by Boris Karloff, has been color-enhanced and sound-restored, according to the info on the box. I recall seeing this movie on TV sometime in the early 70's, probably at Christmas time. It is a great story, very sad in places, but with a good message for children even today, although the extremely old-fashioned look of the film may not hold up to some young kid's attention spans today. I would categorize it as more for people my age who have seen it many years ago and wish to have a lovely nostalgia trip by watching it. Buy it and have tissues handy, it's a weepie! I give it 4 out of 5 stars >>only because my DVD doesn't have all the goodies listed such as the other cartoon short subjects and the documentary material.
