3714530,5,B000924BV8,Im a fan of puni puni and excel saga i think there both funny. I just got volume today and thought it was amazing. This is way better then excel saga. The worst thing about this DVD is only 2episodes i mean im paying $30.99 for 2episodes what a ripoff. If it had like 4or more then i would understand. This rated 17+ for alot of reasons. They say it would offend everyone. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDERN IF YOUR NOT AT LEAST THE AGE OF 15 YOU SHOULDN'T GET THIS LOL.,1081468800,3,460,4.010869565217392
3714531,5,B000924BV8,"For those avid fans of excel saga, this is the anime for you!  Puni Puni is all based on a gag found in episode 17 (i think) of excel saga, a short parody of magical girl shows common in japan, especially amongst young girls.  But make no mistake, this is NOT for children (its strongly suggests age 17+), for it is about the closest thing you can get to an actual hentai program.  It is very like Excel Saga in that it stars a super hyper chick with a modest dream that never really comes true, and along the way (the whole 2 episodes) encounters wacky incidents.  However, unlike Excel Saga, you do not need a thorough understanding of japanese culture.  Just a sense of humor, thats all.  You might even notice some familiar characters, especially Nabeshin, the director's alter ego, and his wife Kumi-Kumi (soup girl, remember?).  Plus, you might be able to catch Koshi Rikdo and Menchi.  And one character, Shii, bares a strong resemblence to Hyatt (blue hair, soft-speaker, well endowned).  And for those who enjoy listenin to the dubbed version (if you're goin sub, i'd be best if you're a fast reader!) its fun to identify the voices of your favorite Excel characters!
Well you could have skipped all that, because i'll just sum it up here:  If you enjoy the antics of Excel Saga (or fan service *blush*) these two episodes are definitely worth your money!  But be prepared for obscene jokes, uncomfortable situations (like the aliens and their... packages hangin down the whole show...), and questionable physical comedy.  I thoroughly enjoyed this program, and i would buy anything else they dish out!
Favorite Part:  When Futaba and Poemi are sleeping head to head and they turn their heads to face each other.... the cracking noise made it priceless.",1081296000,6,1762,4.756578947368421
3714532,4,B000924BV8,"Poemy is a school girl starting out her new year, and things are off to a typical energetic start as she strives to do her best and become a voice actress. But things go from bad to worse when an alien kills her parents, Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, in order to pave the way for an impending invasion. Her home distroyed, Poemy moves in with her best friend Futaba Aasu, (I know people in Japan need to have normal name's) getting back to this, Poemy also moves in with her six sisters, but there's no chance for peace when a massive alien mechanoid attacks the city.",1124668800,5,562,4.3619047619047615
3714533,5,B000924BV8,"puni puni poemy is so wacky so insane,so nonsensical and vulgar....its freakin genius!!!!! the plot doesnt make sense,theres no character development..but you know what?it works in puni punu poemy...think fooly cooly given a heavy amount of red bull and you have a great idea of what this little gem of an ova is like

p.s you might want to pause and take a break every 10 minutes.....yeah its that crazy. IT also has directors comentary on the disk, which is something id like to see more of in anime

3714535,4,B000924BV8,"This anime is crasy but it is still very enjoyable to watch. The theme song is very fun to listen to, and watch very closely, you may notice things you wish you hadn't (i did)and I'm not gonna tell my mom about it.

3714536,3,B000924BV8,"PUNI PUNI POEMY is just that unfortunately.  Left over ideas, characters and designs, not to mention a few recycled ones, similar voices and an identical soundtrack.  EXCEL SAGA, which I love in all of it's hyper strangeness and vulgarness promoted this show on DVD halfway through it's run and I was excited.  When it finally arrived, I was disheartened.  First off besides all of the remarks above, it's only 2 shows and secondly the price was too high and didn't warrant a purchase.  I waited and eventaully saw it and I was glad I didn't submit to an impulse buy.  It moves at the speed of a two year old with Jolt cola running through it's veins and is twice as hard to deal with as the original Excel Saga was but with more vulgarness and strangeness to offset the lack of solid jokes.  The plot as mentioned before is about a weird girls attempt to become an anime voice actress and in the meantime use her super powers to save the world and in the meantime moving in with a family of sisters with their own ""special"" powers.

The few good jokes are funny and the disc has a great commentary running through it with the English speaking actors talking over it and even some of the wilder lines seperated from the rest of the track.  If you want my advice, do what I did.  Wait for an oppertunity to see it first or rent it if you can.  Otherwise pass on it unless you really (read REALLY) love Excel Saga.",1100995200,5,1412,4.351145038167939
3714537,1,B000924BV8,"Excel Saga (by the same director/writers/animation crew and voice team) is a work of brilliant satire and self mockery. All 6 DVD's of Excel Saga received 5 star ratings from me.

Extras in the later Excel Saga DVD's include previews and ""making of"" specials of Puni Puni Poemi, and talk about how excited everyone is about this new leap, this new adventure.

Which just leaves me wondering ""What Went Wrong?"". This poor excuse for an anime seems low budget and unscripted and is grating, uninspired, unfunny and all round irritating. For the Excel Fans out there, try and picture ""Going Way Too Far"" (the last excel Episode) without the established characters or funny bits.

The witty dialog, in-jokes, pop-culture references, inter-cultural sillinesses, genre hopping madness and personal foibles of Excel Saga have been replaced by having the lead characters voice played continuously at double speed, one running gag (The lead character keeps referring to herself by the voice actresses name. So very very funny. Not.) and painful quantities of giant boobs, mock fan service, mock pre-teen lesbianism and ""joke"" hentai.

And just in case that pre-teen-lesbianism (...) (thankfully not at the same time) sounds good to anyone, trust me, it's not. It's all done in a poor and doomed attempt to recreate the zaniness and otaku mocking of Excel Saga, leaving it with all the sex appeal of a sea urchin.

Speaking of the Otaku Mocking, whereas in Excel Saga the director (Shinchi Watanabe, he of the afro) casually joked with the viewers and their foibles from time to time, in Puni Puni Poemi you will get the impression that he got one too many letters requesting nude pictures of Hyatt, and decided that we needed to be punished.

Watanabe-san, for the sake of Excel Saga I will try to forget you ever sullied your name and reputation with Puni Puni Poemi.",1091923200,8,1859,4.9423076923076925
3714538,5,B000924BV8,"Ye all be warned, this is not your run-of-the-mill anime.  Right from the opening prologue, it's firing off spoof after spoof until your mind is fried, and that's just before making it through the opening credits.  It is essential that you have a somewhat clear base background knowledge of general anime, all six disks of Excel Saga, and a strong stomach at times.  It spoofs anything and everything it can get its hands on for the segments, and dumps it all into you so fast you have to watch it over just to catch it.  Inside jokes abound for Excel fans.  Graphics are well done, and are what an anime SHOULD be...  Music is reused Excel Saga BGMS, and the plot...  What plot?  Exactly.  Just imagine this as the ENTIRE 26 episode season of EXCEL SAGA, compressed and distilled into an hour of insanity, and injected directly into your brain.  If you can get past these prerequisits, and can handle downright VULGER humor, then you're ready to take on this madcap satire.  And if you can handle it, you should be laughing yourself sick.  If your mind isn't numb after this, check yourself into a psychiatrist.

3714539,5,B000924BV8,"This is one DAMN good 2 episode anime. I really liked the twisted humor. Although it is sexualy oriented, I do not believe it is ""meant"" for boys only.
I am a girl and I loved this anime more than most anime out there...
If you do not appreciate twisted humor, then why bother watching anime in the first place?
I think this anime is worth buying!! If you like crazy anime and you are over a certain age! I'd say 16 or so... You should definately get it!!! ^_^",1088035200,8,460,4.122222222222222
3714540,2,B000924BV8,"I had just finished watching ""Puni Puni Poemy"" and I was definitely suprised at some of the things that they did. I loved the ""Excel Saga"" series and I thought that this two episode OAV would be just as fun, but it ended up to be another sex anime for boys.  Although some parts I really did  enjoy, but it was too much sex oriented. I am not saying that this would be a complete waste of time. Just that it is a fan service for the boys.",1086998400,4,438,3.965909090909091
3714541,5,B000924BV8,"This is the best anime I've seen since Excel Saga.  In fact, it practically is Excel Saga. Poemy is basically just a younger Excel, voiced by the mighty Cynthia Martinez of Slayers fame.  A lot of the same humor, attitude, and bit players as Excel Saga are here as well (not to mention a character that not only closely resembles Hyatt, but has the same voice).  This is not a bad thing. I've been dying for another fix that only Shinichi Watanabe (aka Nabeshin) could provide.  I enjoy the fact that Poemy refers to herself not only in the third person, but as her Japanese voice-actresse's name because, as Nabeshin so delicately puts it: ""The bitch can't stay in character.""  She also refers to her father, Nabeshin, as ""the director"" and cheers her repeated transformation scenes because ""We can reuse the art!"".  THAT, my friends, is anime satire!  I also enjoyed Poemy's bad temper and penchant for destruction.  However, if you are offended by pre-teen lesbianism, rape, S&M, graphic guttings of talking fish (don't ask), lots of cursing, or characters that never talk about anything besides their own breasts than maybe you'd better pass on this one.  This anime is, as Lord Illpilazzo would say, ""base and vulgar"" even beyond it's predecessor. I'd only recommend this to fans of Excel Saga simply because so many of the in-jokes revolve around premises that were established in that legendary series.  Newcomers to Watanabe/Nabeshin's insane (and often inane) humor will probably be confused by the rapid-fire style of self-satire that he employs.  In other words, go check out Excel Saga (all of it) and then come back and I think you will be pleased with this follow-up.  If you loved Excel Saga, and especially if you thought it didn't go far enough, I promise you will not be dissappointed with Puni Puni Poemy.",1086220800,7,1824,4.848387096774194

That kind of says it all really. Don't get this for your kids (unless you don't mind about this kind of stuff...or just don't care). It's a two episode OVA from the creator of excel saga. Lots of (almost) nudity, and some loli lesbians. God, I love fan service.",1238371200,,336,4.265625
8324936,2,B000924BV8,"NOTE: THIS VIDEO IS NOT FOR KIDS! NO WAY!

Like most of the negative reviews of PUNI PUNI POEMY on Amazon have said, I was a fan of EXCEL SAGA and looked forward to this follow-up. However, the two-part story feels more like a rushed, desperate cash-in on EXCEL SAGA's surprise international success than something well planned-out - along with an attempt to both pander to and mock overseas (read: ""mainly English-speaking"") audiences' slackjawed fascination with Japan's BDSM-style graphic entertainment and ""fan service"" (female characters in fetishistic outfits and sexualized poses).

PUNI PUNI POEMY accentuates its predecessor's frenetic characters winking at the audience to the point of a Sarah Palin-on-crack nervous tic, it pushes the idea of young girl-girl crushes and alternative sexual experimentation to (hopefully!) absurd extremes that are nonetheless uncomfortable to Western audiences - and somewhere along the line, it forgot that what made EXCEL SAGA such a blast were the layers upon layers of Asian and Western Pop Cultures colliding and crashing into each other to hilarious effect. Here, the closest we get to that is a GUNDAM-style evil robot versus female superheroes with strictly ""defensive"" powers (like precognition when the enemy's right in front of you, or the ability to spread flowers!), a silly and oft-repeated ""Magic Girl Nude Transformation"" scene (that includes Poemy pulling her socks off with her feet!), and an obvious Death Star mockup complete with building cranes attached above the Earth, accompanied by not-quite-TIE Fighters as music suspiciously like John Williams' ""The Imperial March"" thunders on the soundtrack. They're all funny scenes, but there's not near enough of them - and there are far too many sex jokes both straight and kinky, pointless digressions and WTF? plot twists, even for a satiric show. Just because you SAY the plot makes no sense doesn't excuse you from a plot that makes no sense....

In the end, I felt PUNI PUNI POEMY lacked the comic discipline that Koushi Rikudou apparently gave EXCEL SAGA - and cannot recommend it for that reason.",1233100800,,2114,5.267062314540059
8324937,5,B000924BV8,"this movie is a 2 episode series very similar to excel saga, only this spoofs the ""group of girls bateling for the safety of the planet"" theme of so many anime series'. it also has alot of shock value humor (similar to the ""Final Episode"" of excel) and has very random, rapid content that leaves you descovering more things each time you watch it

8324939,4,B000924BV8,"I really couldn't tell with this anime series. The begining of the anime series -or (the first few minutes) really didn't grab my attention because it was god awful boring and not even funny. Then later on in the first episode, it was sitting on three words to describe it..pure funny junk. Some parts in the first episode had a few laughs but then the laughs die down and you are just looking in shock and saying what the hell just happened but for me it was enough to keep watching on to the second episode. The second episode can only be describe as 'ecchi' and wasn't it almost to be considered 'hentai'. Well anyway...the second episode was annoying ecchi junk...maybe that's the only words I can describe it. Very few laughs just alot of ecchi junk that could give an animated teenage boy a nosebleed for hours but for this series I can't stop watching. Overrall I am kinda indifferent on it. I wouldn't say it's worth the money or it's not worth the money. So just stuck. Just go on Youtube and watch the first episode of Puni Puni and see what you think about it.",1155081600,,1071,4.414141414141414
8324940,1,B000924BV8,"Shinichi Watanabe, the same director from the comedy anime  named, Excel worked on this project and tried to re-create the crazy energy and humor into Puni Puni Poemi. Puni Poemi is a parody of other parody, so it is making fun of other animes that made fun of others. Though it sounds like a wishful paradox integrated into the storyline, the story itself is simplistic and really dumb. Poemi Wantanabi is a young girl like twelve years old who aspires to be a voice actor in the anime industry, but hasn't been offered the job. Poemi also transforms into a super hero and fights off an alien invasion which on taking over Earth. Poemi, is super hyper and super crazy; she talks super fast and does crazy things on screen like stabbing herself with pencils, screaming at the top of her lungs, laughing and crying sometimes at the same time, bouncing around the screen more than Daffy Duck. She's not the only crazy one though, other characters in the show are just as insane and the pacing will get you tired, there is barely a moment of peace in the two episode series. There are lots of weak jokes in attempt to create humor in which only come off as cheesy or perverted, there is some fan service but it is not very erotic, but instead is a parody of hentai anime. There is a constant [...] theme which seem out of place between all the female characters and even scenes that imply sexual activity between two underage girls. The storyline has no cohesive element so there is nothing to follow, the dialog is very stupid and nowhere near the humor of Excel Saga. Puni Puni Poemi is only two episodes long, there is some perversion in the episodes, so I cannot recommend it to anyone under 16 years of age. This was a waste of time and money. If you want comedy anime I recommend the ""Excel Saga"" and if you want fan service get ""Agent Aika"".",1145750400,,1845,4.458579881656805
