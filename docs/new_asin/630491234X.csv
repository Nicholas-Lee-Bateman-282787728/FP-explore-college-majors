7881336,3,630491234X,"When the two Gappa creatures are attacking the industrial part of Tokyo towards the latter end of Gappa-The Triphibian monster, one of them rears back its head and roars.  That brief excerpt ended up being used in the Red Dwarf 4th season episode Meltdown, on a planet that featured some fake-looking dinosaurs.
OK, so much for where I first saw these beasties.  But what is a Gappa?  Well, if Godzilla and Rodan mated and had a baby, it'd probably look like Gappa.  It's inherited Rodan's head and wings, and Godzilla's gray-green scaled body, blue flame, and a resonant roar more like the sound of a flushing toilet played backwards, it doesn't give a rapid constipated bark like Rodan, but durned if I know whose eyes it got.
The story too is derivative, coming from Mothra.  Basically, Mr. Funatsu, publisher of Playmate Magazine, finances and sends a team that includes reporter Kurosaki, female photographer Koyanagi, and scientist Tonaka to Obelisk Island in the Pacific to collect bird and animal specimens, as well as native women.  His plan is to open a holiday theme park so that Japanese do not have to go all the way to the Pacific to get that exotic Polynesian atmosphere.  The expedition is greeted by the dark-skinned islanders, led by a white-haired patriarch (same as in Mothra).  However, despite warnings from the young boy Saki not to enter a cave, Kurosaki and Koyanagi do so and find an egg which hatches into a prehistoric-looking reptile.  The expedition take it back with them to Japan, against the wishes of the natives.  ""Gappa angry,"" they keep repeating.  And that's true, as the parents of the abducted baby head over to Japan to recover their child (q.v. Mothra coming to Japan to rescue the twin fairies).  But Funatsu's profit-motivated greed gets the better of him, like Nelson in Mothra, and he refuses to give the baby up, even despite the pleading of his young daughter.
The scenes of destruction are nothing much to shout home about, as they are the usual retreads of people in rubber suits stomping on model Tokyos, trampling on buildings, melting model tanks, blasting airplanes out of the sky, and convoys of military vehicles.
Apart from this being widescreen and in original Japanese, something not available in any of the Toho monster pics over here, there are some interesting issues explored.  One is the examination of empathic understanding.  In one scene, Saki and Funatsu's young daughter go up to the captured baby, who quiets down and looks at them sadly, showing a link between animal and human kindness.
Another is the role of women in 1960's Japan.  In the dark cave, Koyanagi becomes a bit hesitant.  Kurosaki then taunts her, ""[fine], go back marry an office worker, have babies and change diapers"" a la the traditional role of women in the modern world.  One phrase that isn't translated in the subtitles is ""tamanegi o kitte,"" meaning cutting onions.  In other words, stay in the kitchen.
So what does that title mean, ""triphibian""?  Well, given its Greek etymology, amphibian means able to live a double life, in water and in land, as frogs and salamanders.  Triphibian thus means water, land, and air.
Despite some serious issues explored, material cribbed from Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra by Kaiju Productions, (kaiju meaning Japanese for monster) and unconvincing monsters overshadow what could've been a good story.",1081468800,8,3380,4.948672566371681
7881337,3,630491234X,Its an alright flick the main reason I like it in a way is because the parents of the gappa son come looking for it after i was taken from its own and they cried at the end when they found its son (MAN I FEEL LIKE CRYING TO).Its an alright flick the action was alright but i rather you rent this then buy to see what you think about it. In my opinion its not as good as some of the other kajiu films but certainly one you need to set and watch for your self.,1079827200,,458,3.731958762886598
7881338,4,630491234X,"Gappa was also released under the title Monster From A Prehistoric Planet - which was the title I often saw used for the versions shown on TV.
There are many similarities between Gappa and Gorgo (1961). Both have young monsters being taken from their homes only to have its parent(s) looking for it. The British film, Gorgo, also used a man in suit approach for the monsters.
The special effects of Gappa are equal to the Godzilla movie made around this time - like Destroy All Monsters or Son of Godzilla. Not the best years for special effects from Japan. The film budgets for many Japanese kaiju films seemed to be going down around this time. It was more noticeable in the Gamera series than in the Godzilla series. A good story often made one forget bad special effects. Gappa kinda falls in the middle on that.
In Gappa, it's not the best version of this story, but it's enjoyable. However, I'm tempted to recommend Gorgo over Gappa.
I can't confirm this right now, but I think footage of this movie has appeared in an episode of the British comedy series Red Dwarf. I believe it was the episode called ""Meltdown"" which is on the tape, Red Dwarf IV - Byte Two: Dimension Jump.",1008547200,2,1182,4.52803738317757
7881339,4,630491234X,A fun and campy sci-fi monster film that only the Japanese could produce. Recommended for all kaiju fans!,917827200,,105,4.888888888888889
