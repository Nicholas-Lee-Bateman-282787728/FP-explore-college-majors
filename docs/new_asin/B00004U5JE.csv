7923640,5,B00004U5JE,"One day when I was looking around at the ole Family Video and they were geting rid of all of their VHS Tapes and players VHS tapes for 10 cents each. I bought atleast 200 VHS tapes All extremely rare ones like Spike and mike sick and twisted vol 1 (NOT THE RE RELEASE), and many other which I ma rate soon. So they give me a box for the tapes and off I set for home for video watchin. Now before Watching this I looked at the box cover and thought... ""Oh Crap kids stuff"" and well I was vey very wrong. So it playing and the intro is very amazing a CGI globe and the title in pure 26K Gold. So then it played it and it had many intrusting shorts on here. Not one of these shorts were over 5 mins(which what I like in a short films not like 20 mins of boring savavy crap). There is this one short I must adress this one short on here. It is very strange I have no idea what it's called but this strange (looks like) Topless women keeps on looking stright and singing the same word ""I know who you are, come from a planet from a distant star"" with strange images with UFOs and unreal papers proclaiming alien life has hit earth"". Honstley the strangest thing I've ever seen since General Chaos Uncensored Animation (which also came with the movies I bought for ten cents). Well this tape is good quailty humor some nudity but nothing to get (sorry) horny off. This tape I highly recomend for old Computer buffs or just plain love AMIGA animation capabilitys. Well whatever the case I would buy this tape reletivley soon beacuse I think this tape I've seen on Ebay for 200 dollars somewhere (Glad i got mine for 10 cents). Thanks and GO AMIGA!!}",1263859200,,1642,4.199367088607595
