It is NOT the entire drama.  It IS bits n pieces of the drama.  It would be difficult to understand the plot based on the bits they used.  If you have seen the drama many times, this would be a little review & your memory would fill in the blanks.  NOT the fault of the supplier, I should have realized ONE disc is not the drama & couldn't be.  Most people would figure that out before they bought it.  But just in case, THIS is an over view of the drama only.  Maybe I am the only person who would order it thinking it was the whole drama b/c most people are smarter.  But just in case, I mention it here.",1388534400,4,781,3.8797468354430378
