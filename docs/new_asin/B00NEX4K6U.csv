In two information packed hours you get  a basic program of strikes and kicks that are meant to inflict as much damage as possible. You get a good basic program of point shooting. You get a basic program for using a knife for self protection, and finally McSweeney demonstrates the Tiger Moves method of physical conditioning. This was originally recorded in 1991, when McSweeney was well in his sixties. His program was meant to be useful for one's entire life, not just when you are young and athletic. This is a classic instructional program from a well respected  teacher. If you have a VHS player, you can still find a tape from time to time. If you go to IHF, they have it for slightly less than twenty bucks. It is well worth the cost.",1438214400,2,806,4.551724137931035
