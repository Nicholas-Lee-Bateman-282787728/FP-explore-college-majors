8511535,5,B00772GUPI,This is a great movie to watch.  John Wayne at his best.  Recommend to everyone to buy and watch this movie.,1381017600,,108,4.095238095238095
8511536,3,B00772GUPI,"One of the Duke's earliest movies.  The picture is pretty rough, it looks like it has been digitized in some areas, I suspect this is partly a result of whatever print was used to make this something that can be burned to DVD.  Some areas the Black & White is pretty dark, other areas, very sharp. Compared to the amazing release of The Big Trail, a movie a year older than this, there is a huge drop off in picture quality.  Audio is sharp however.

John Wayne is really a supporting character in this movie and probably is on screen about 30 minutes. This is more a Buck Jones movie as opposed to a John Wayne movie.  Buck wears the biggest cowboy hat you've ever seen.  Not a movie I will watch too many times, but at least I have this in my collection now.

The package is very threadbare, simple case and DVD, exactly like the picture shown here on Amazon.  the DVD itself has one chapter.",1372464000,,894,4.279761904761905
8511537,4,B00772GUPI,"Just another one of an earlier John Wayne ""B"" movie, but it's cute, short, and has...John Wayne.  One needs to be a fan of John Wayne in order to appreciate these cheaply produced B flicks.",1361232000,,189,4.4
