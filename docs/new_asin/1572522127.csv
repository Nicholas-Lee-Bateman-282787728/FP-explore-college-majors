189996,4,1572522127,"I must have watched this film at least twenty times--it never gets boring.  A lot of talking in this film--if you don't know French, have fun reading the relentless subtitles.  Interesting dialog about Pascal--the idea of fate, luck, wager.  It serves as the film's allegory--gambling on a relationship with a person who is both sensual and pious.  Can there be happiness in such a combination?  One has to only take a chance.  And even though you may think you found that special someone with both attributes, there's always a catch.  And the catch in ""...Maud's"" is revealed at the end of the film--which is absolutely beautiful.  The DVD is not as bad as some of the reviews here claim it to be--it's black and white, so with the exception of a couple of scenes with weak contrasts, I think it's an above average transfer.  Heck, it's shot by Cuba's very own Oscar winner Nestor Almendros (Days of Heaven).",1111708800,6,909,4.7025316455696204
189997,5,1572522127,"This is the fourth and best of Eric Rohmer's six moral tales. Like many of Rohmer's films, ""My Night at Maud's"" is about the search for a life-partner, temptation and fidelity. Also, like most Rohmer films, ""My Night at Maud's"" is made up mainly of conversation's, and some might find it ""boring"" or ""just talking."" But the conversations are interesting and intellectually stimulating, and, at the films end, the last piece of the puzzle falls into place.
An engineer (Jean-Louis Trintignant) becomes infatuated with a woman he sees in Church (Marie-Christine Barrault). But before he is able to ask her out, he spends the night at the apartment of Maud (Francoise Fabian) trying to be faithful to his Catholic values by resisting her attempts at seduction. (I won't spoil the film by telling you how his night with Maud ends.) He later meets, dates, and eventually marries the woman from Church. Years later, after running into Maud at the beach, he discovers that his wife has a connection to Maud. (Again, I won't spoil the film by telling you what it is.)",1025827200,12,1059,4.824175824175824
189998,4,1572522127,"""The heart has it reasons which reason knows nothing of."" --Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)
This is the Eric Romer film they warned you about.  There is a lot of talk, talk, and more talk.  But the talk is very interesting.  One of the main topics of discussion is Pascal's famous wager.  Pascal believed that if there is even the slightest chance of the Christian heaven being true, then as a matter of probability, one ought to be a believer.  Even a minuscule chance of everlasting paradise is worth the bet because infinity (eternity) times even a very small number is infinity.  And, of course, if not believing puts one in however small the danger of eternal damnation, then again one should be a believer.  But, as Vidal (Antoine Vitez) sagely remarks in the movie, infinity times zero is still zero.
Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as a 34-year-old Catholic mathematician who has a way with women.  He runs into his old school chum, Vidal, who introduces him to Maud (Francoise Fabian), who has a way with men.  Funny but they don't quite hit it off even though she manipulates him into spending the night with her.  Their conversation is witty, subliminal and revealing.  Maud believes in the supremacy of love, Jean-Louis in being morally flexible.  Although a believing and practicing Catholic, he tells Maud that one is not going against God's will by chasing girls anymore than one is going against God's will by doing mathematics.
The girl that Jean-Louis is currently chasing is 22-year-old Francoise (Maire-Christine Barrault) a blonde, Catholic girl that he has spied at church.  At first it seems that although he is certain that she is perfect for him, she is reluctant.  They too fence with words as they try to mislead and reveal at the same time, and the audience is intrigued, so much so that at times you might forget you are watching a movie.  In this sense a Romer film is like a stage play.  Whereas contemporary directors try to get by with as little dialogue as possible, to let the action itself reveal character, Romer is not shy about using dialogue to reveal character, plot, theme--the whole works.
The film begins with a long close shot of Francoise's profile as she listens in church, turning twice briefly to face the camera.  She is pretty and intriguing.  Although we won't realize it until the movie is mostly over, she is the focal point of the balance between the world views of Jean-Louis and Maud.  After the night at Maud's during which Maud uses her intuition and sly intelligence to figure out Jean-Louis's character, he spends the night with Francoise.  She uses her instincts to figure out not his character so much as his aptness for her.  And then it is revealed how Francoise figures twice in the life of Maud.  I won't anticipate the revelation, but be sure and watch for it.  Suffice it to say that there are two reasons that Francoise is far from Maud's favorite person!  The film ends, as French films often do, with the ironic affirmation of bourgeois values.
For today's DVD hound this movie will play slowly or not at all.  The use of dialogue as something over and above the plot and action of the film will seem demanding and perhaps old fashioned.  The deliberately drawn out scenes at church may cause you to yawn.  But I recommend you stay with it.  The movie has a quality that lingers long after the action is gone.  The underlying philosophy about the nature of human love and how it conflicts or is compatible with reason and/or religion really does reflect to some extent the quotation above from Pascal, whose spirit is akin, although he denies it, to that of Jean-Louis, the careful protagonist of this very interesting film.",1021507200,13,3687,4.744113029827315
189999,5,1572522127,"There are few filmmakers whom I can say truly put me in a good mood and Rohmer is one of those filmmakers. What I love about Rohmer's films is the delicacy and the subtleness in them.
 ""My Night At Maud's"" was the third film in Rohmer's ""Six Moral Tales"". And many see it not only as the best of the six, but, also as Rohmer's best film. And, they have a good case to give it that credit.
 To those who are unaware of the story it goes something like this, and I'll try not to reveal any major plot-points.
 A young man, Jean-Louis (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is searching for the perfect mate. A woman who must share his religious beliefs, which are catholic, and his views of love. He has set quite a high standard for himself, considering it's the ""modern world"". Where religion doesn't really play a big part in most people lives or at least in the women whom he meets. That is until he meets a beautiful blond,Francoise (Marie-Christine Barrault) in of all places, church! He soon finds himself, along with a friend, Vidal (Antoine Vitez) spending the night at Maud's. A ""modern"" woman with ""modern"" views. These two seem to be as different as they come. She is not really what he's looking for and he is too ""old-fashion"" for her.
 What happens afterwards is truly priceless. As Rohmer has made a film that is about as funny as a film could be dealing with sexual morals. It also has some of the ""smartest"" dialogue I've ever heard. If you've never seen a Rohmer film, this is a wonderful place to start. One of the best French films of all-time and one of the true ""classics"" in cinema.
 ""My Night At Maud's"" was nominated for two Oscars; ""Best Foreign Film"" and ""Best Screenplay"". It was also hailed as the best film of the year in 1970 by the late Gene Siskel.",1017446400,13,1766,4.421538461538462
190000,1,1572522127,"The plot of this film is simple enough. A man who is a Catholic sees a woman whom he decides to pursue. She is young attractive and blond. Nowdays he comes across as something of a stalker.
Some time later he meets and old friend and they go to vist a woman called Maude. Maude is a single mother and she and the Catholic end up alone. She talks him into staying the night but the couple do not have sex.
Thus the hero heads off to marry the blond. The end of the film is a chance meeting with Maude and the realisation that the blond had by chance been Maude's husbands mistress.
In 1969 this would have been seen as a pretty sexy film. It relies on the tension of whether the hero and Maude will have sex or whether the vision of the blond will keep him from straying. The irony of course being that the blond was not that virtous herself. The film maker it would seem also is of the view that Maude is a more interesting or attractive women than the blond as she can talk.
The problem with the film is that it is very much a static film which is filled with huge amounts of dialogue. The sexual tension between the characters is something which would have kept audiences interested in the late 60's. Now with the change that has occured in sexual morals you just hear the dialogue. The reality that the conversation is very very dull.
The other problem is that all of the characters are drop kicks. The male is a person whom the audience is meant to identify with. Yet he does not say one thing that is amusing, interesting or even notworthy. He is a person who is attracted to women on a superficial basis, falling in love without speaking to the object of his love. Maude is okay but she goes on and on and on. She also appears to be attracted to the lead drop kick which is not easy to understand.
This might have rated as an interesting movie in its time but its now dull dull dull.",1011398400,6,1889,4.1923076923076925
190001,5,1572522127,"Louis (Jean-Louis Trintigant)is a philandering intellectual with several affairs behind him. But when late in life he becomes a convert to Catholicism, he decides to turn his back on his past and settle down to married life with a nice Catholic girl - preferably a blond. He finds Francoise (Marie-Christine Barrault), the perfect candidate, in a  Catholic church - where else? -  pursues her and makes a date, but before he can keep the date he meets Vidal (Antoine Vitez ), an old school friend who he hasn't seen for fourteen years. Vidal  takes him to the home of Maud, a highly intelligent and lovely to look at young woman. For several hours they have  a lively conversation about the philosophy of Pascal and freedom of choice - which is ironic in view of what happens later -  until Vidal leaves. After which the conversation becomes more intimate and confiding as they build up a strong rapport. Surely you think he cannot still be intending to keep his date with the blond, when he has  this new so  much more promising relationship developing. But there is only one problem; she is not a Catholic. She tries to seduce him and though she manages to persuade him to stay the night he refuses to get into bed with her preferring to lie on the top of the bed wrapped in a blanket - with her lying naked under the bed clothes alongside him. This takes  some suspension of disbelief from the viewer. Towards morning she makes a more overt attempt to seduce him but again fails - his newly found Catholic conscience will not allow him to succumb.
Being a Catholic, you see, now debars him from doing what he has done so often in his previous life; sleeping with a woman outside marriage. And so because he allows himself to be governed by these new strictures, he loses his ideal woman, the intellectual equal who would have made him happy, and goes off to keep his date and marry the blond.
Though he may have seemed to choose the blond in preference to Maude, in reality he made no such choice; his choice was determined for him by the strictures of the Catholic Church. If he had met Maude a year earlier, before his conversion to Catholicism, he would have been able to make a free unrestricted choice and would no doubt have chosen Maude.
It emerges that the blond was Maude's ex-husband's mistress  - a piece of information introduced presumably to show that she is not the devout, pure -minded virgin he originally assumed her to be.
He meets Maude one last time five years later on the sand dunes at some sea side resort - he with his wife and child, she alone. They talk in a desultory way; she tells him that she is unhappily married again and asks why he never phoned her as he had promised, and then she walks out of his life for ever.
This I think is the best of Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales, if only because the usual long conversations have more substance.",1009497600,6,2876,4.483747609942639
190002,5,1572522127,"How to find the right words to make you want to discover french author/director Eric Rohmer ? I would lie if I'd say MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S is an action movie. It's not a boring arty work either. Eric Rohmer is a very  peculiar case among french directors. He's interested in morals, in the  deep psychology of his movies' characters, in literature and philosophical  problems. Vast program, rich but not rebarbative at all.
MY NIGHT AT  MAUD'S is the third of the six moral tales he shot in the sixties and early  seventies. The action takes place in Clermont-Ferrand, in southern France.  Jean-Louis Trintignant (leading actor of Lelouch's A MAN AND A WOMAN) is a  catholic 34 years old man looking for a girl to marry. Observing a young  blonde girl at the Mass celebration, he decides she will be the one.
His  friend Antoine Vitez invites him to pass an evening at Franoise  ""MAUD"" Fabian's place. Light dialogs become soon a conversation  about the Grace, the Predestination, the Sin and the Faith. Antoine Vitez  leaves and let the not-so puritan Trintignant alone with a Maud still  chatting and lying in bed almost naked.
Will Trintignant succumb to the  charm of Maud or be faithful to the blonde girl he hasn't had the chance to  meet yet ? That's the moral point of the movie. MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S is a  1968 movie, shot in black and white with english subtitles you can't remove  (!), that has won two Oscars. I sincerely hope you'll have the curiosity to  take a look at it since 5 or 6 Rohmer's movies have hit the DVD market  these last months, all of them being pure gems. Oh yes ! I forgot. MY NIGHT  AT MAUD'S is one of these movies that can deeply change in you the way you  approach movies.
Take the risk to consider MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S as a DVD  for your library.",955929600,19,1778,4.439628482972136
190003,5,1572522127,"A young engineer meets two young women one Christmas: he marries one, but never quite forgets the other.
There's no more to the plot than that, but Eric Rohmer creates his finest film from this simple situation. It's a  disarmingly intelligent movie, with complex characters who are miles away  from Hollywood's notion of how people speak and think. The acting is pitch  perfect, and the black-and-white cinematography by famed Spanish cameraman  Nestor Almendros is intimate and evocative.
If you love Rohmer's other  films, you're bound to enjoy this one. If you've never seen the work of  this highly original French director, this is the place to begin.",946252800,4,657,5.093457943925234
7797871,4,1572522127,"My Night at Maud's is a great film for those who like subtle romance where what is not said counts more than what is said. That said, this film is an easy one to mis-watch. There is a lot of talk about intellectual and theological topics, and it can seem as if the film is about that. Not so, most of the film you can get from how the characters carry themselves and how they interact; their words are secondary. Besides that, the talk is meant to be partly funny and partly serious; some of the intellectual talk is relevant to the theme, and some of it is intentionally pretentious. Indeed, the main themes of the film are pretention and predestination. (Which is interesting since even though the film is set back in the 1960s, French ""designed"" milieau feels as if it were modern and fresh and free.) Overall, the final product has a very nice, witty, and young feel to it. I rate this one up on account of some good characterizations, and the fact that the actress playing Maud is damn sexy with French charm -- well, that factors right in.",1444003200,,1045,4.419689119170984
7797872,5,1572522127,"Made in 1968 Ma Nuit chez Maud (My Night at Mauds) is the third (actually made fourth) of &Eacute;ric Rohmers Six Contes moreaux (Six Moral Tales). Together with La Collectioneuse (The Collector) and Le Genou de Claire (Claires Knee) it is the film which brought Rohmers name to international recognition as a film director. He had already achieved fame as editor of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma (1957-63) and as associate of those other illustrious critics Jean Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and Franois Truffaut. In 1957 he co-authored with Chabrol a hugely influential book on Hitchcock, and in 1959 he made his first feature film, Le Signe du lion (The Sign of Leo). Unlike his colleagues however, Rohmer delayed directing more feature films until La Collectioneuse (1967) choosing instead to make a series of shorts and work for TV. It was as a decidedly late puff of the nouvelle vague that Rohmer arrived on the international festival scene, and it is interesting that of all the directors involved in this famous movement in modernist film making, his films have perhaps lasted the longest in terms of remaining relevant to audiences. I would argue this is because Rohmer addresses the eternal mysteries of human existence which never seem old-fashioned or dated. Indeed, his films always suggest in a very modern way that human nature is basically unknowable and feature characters who endlessly turn over possibilities in ambiguous narratives which rarely resolve themselves in easy conclusions.

A conservative Catholic in outlook, Rohmer is uninterested in attacking the form of cinema itself &aacute; la Godard, ignores completely the pervasive affects of Hollywood melodrama which affect Truffaut, has no truck with either the theatrics of Rivette or the genre-bending of Chabrol. Instead he marshals the philosophical and literary traditions of the French Enlightenment (as embodied by Blaise Pascal, Jean de La Bruy&egrave;re, Franois de La Rouchfoucauld and Stendhal) within modern day tales which focus on men and women debating their own personal morality and negotiating their everyday lives through simply talking with one another. A persons life is determined by decisions made and how these decisions are arrived at (or avoided) is the meat of any given Rohmer film. We in the audience are never expected to be emotionally involved. On the contrary we are detached from proceedings and left to observe from afar. As Robert Phillip Kolker says in The Altering Eye (Oxford, 1983), Rohmer offers no invitation to emotional involvement and asks of the viewer only disinterested observation and understanding. Thus we have a long series of films which foreground conversation between members of the directors chosen social milieu (the French bourgeoisie) in which ideas are debated, feelings are discussed, decisions are made or delayed, and people generally negotiate their way through life the best way they can. Melodrama is studiously ignored along with any observance of genre conventions while characters are observed with great warmth and generosity with melodramatic confrontation downplayed in favor of reasoned discussion in which all participants are allowed their say equally. There are no big events, no car chases, no violence, no fights, nothing that conventional Hollywood cinema offers by way of seduction. Instead we have a series of highly acute mature films for adults which stay fundamentally very close to everyday human lives and offer pearls of wisdom for those patient enough to listen and watch carefully.

The intellectual framework of Rohmers world may be bedded within the French enlightenment tradition, but the inspiration for the Six Contes moreaux is first and foremost cinematic. Just as Le Signe du lion had been a play on F. W. Murnaus Der Letzte Mann (1924), so these films are six variations on the main theme of the great German directors iconic silent masterpiece Sunrise (1927). Each film tells the story of a man committed to a woman, sidetracked by another and then returned to his true love. Murnau presents his characters as nameless archetypes possibly to encourage us to read deeper philosophical implications into the story. As well as returning us back to the virtual origins of cinema, Rohmer recognized this is the story of the way Man relates to Woman in any given age and hit upon the idea of tackling the same subject repeatedly in a contemporary context: I persuaded myself that the best thing would be to treat the subject six times overI was determined to be flexible and intractable, because if you persist in an idea it seems to me in the end you do secure a following. In these films Rohmer conducts psychological investigations into what the characters think about their behavior rather than depicting the behavior itself and we should appreciate that the French word moraliste means someone who thinks and feels as opposed to the English someone who moralizes. Rohmer wanted the Six Contes moreaux to portray in film what seemed most alien to the medium, to express feelings buried deep in our consciousness. Thats why they have to be narrated in the first person singularThe protagonist discusses himself and judges his actions. I film the process.

As in Sunrise, the main character of Ma Nuit chez Maud remains nameless (I will call him Trintignant). He is an unmarried engineer working at the Michelin plant in the provincial city of Clermont-Ferrand. A devout Catholic, he is attracted during a church service to the blonde Franoise (Marie-Christine Barrault). In a voiceover he states his intention to marry this good Catholic girl even though he has yet to even speak to her. Trintignant runs into his old friend Vidal (Antoine Vitez), a philosophy lecturer. The probability of their meeting being so rare, they embark on a conversation about mathematical probability which veers onto Blaise Pascal (the French enlightenment philosopher and mathematician famed for his wager  that it pays to believe in God because if you win, you win eternity; if you lose, you lose nothing). Vidal is a Marxist who nevertheless manages to co-opt Pascals Wager for his own outlook substituting belief in the Revolution for belief in God even though its Christian basis would appear to suit Trintignants Catholicism more. Trintignant however professes dissatisfaction with Pascal, conflicting as it does with his personal interpretation of his own faith. After attending a Leonid Kogan violin recital Trintignant is persuaded to visit Vidals friend Maud the following night (Christmas Eve). Maud (Franoise Fabian) turns out to be a beautiful sexually liberated Protestant divorc&eacute;e paediatrician who lives with her 8 year old daughter. The trio embark on a lengthy conversation ranging from religion to atheism, from love to morality and centers mainly on the ideas of Pascal. Underneath the smart conversation the characters play with each other from their own carefully distinguished positions. Vidal is a Marxist claiming to have invited Trintignant so as to avoid the boredom of sleeping with Maud again and to tempt his friend into sampling free love. Maud is a Protestant but professes non-belief. She may believe in free-love and enjoys playing the seduction game but is aware that Vidal is in love with her and is presenting Trintignant to her as a test. Trintignant is the apex of the triangle and the conversation centers on his moral choices and especially in his belief in the Pascalian leap of faith and the consequent commitment to a morality already decided. For him he has already decided on his future wife (or perhaps thinks God has already decided it for him in a predestined manner  Pascal was a predestinarian Jansenist) and even though he has yet to speak to her he feels he cannot break his commitment. He is therefore faced here with a choice between two leaps of faith  to keep with his predestined good Catholic girl or take up with an attractive non-believer. It is a choice between the sacred and the profane and as the passage of Pascal from his Pens&eacute;es quoted earlier in the bookshop which Trintignant shares with us indicates it is no surprise that he chooses the former. The important passage flashes past us very quickly so I present it here:

by behaving as if they believed, by taking holy water, by hearing mass, etc. Naturally this will make you believe and will dull you.
But that is just what I fear.
Why? What have you to lose?
But to show you that this is the way, it is that this will lessen your passions, which are your great stumbling block.

So Trintignant endures an uncomfortable evening alone with Maud who, once Vidal leaves them to it, tries her level best to entice his passions. Trapped by a snowstorm into spending the night in her apartment and in her bed with her naked form he is sorely tempted and almost gives in, his indecision finally infuriating Maud. His resolute faith in his predestined fate is seemingly rewarded by God by presenting his future wife by chance (more mathematical probability) in the street as he sits inside a caf&eacute; looking outside. He rushes out to talk to Franoise and the die is cast. But how good is this good Catholic girl? As the courtship continues in the snowy landscape of Clermont she confesses she has had an affair with a married man which has only recently finished. This forces Trintignant into breaking his own moral code. Wanting to empathize with her he confesses to spending the night with a woman just before he picked Franoise up on the street. This half-lie becomes a full lie when a chance meeting between the now happily married couple and Maud at the beach in the films epilogue reveals that Franoises affair had been with Mauds husband before, a fact brushed over by Trintignant referring to Maud as an old flame to appease his wife. He may as well have had sex with Maud that night after all for all the meaning it has on his future marriage. Any sense of absolute morality can only remain private. The film ends with a happy couple and their child all running down to the sea, but the result of Trintignants wager is left very much up in the air. In real life after all, nobody can ever be 100% sure they have made the right choice or made the right wager. We all have to live with the results of the decisions we make whether we feel they have been predestined or not with personal morality by necessity having to be distinguished from the morality we display to the outside world.

Ma Nuit chez Maud isn't an easy film, but it startles by its extremely sharp first person narrative which is articulated within an amazingly precise script. Each character encounter (Trintignant-Vidal / Trintignant-Vidal-Maud / Trintignant-Maud / Trintignant-Franoise / Trintignant-Maud / Trintignant-Maud-Franoise / Trintignant-Franoise-child) is beautifully etched with great stress laid on how Trintignants character changes through each of them. We are always reminded that this isn't how he really was, but rather how he imagines himself to have been from a point in the future. We see a journey from detached bachelor and intellectually-engaged friend through cramped and uncomfortable priggish awkwardness throughout his night with Maud to charming engaged lover and warm husband of Franoise. The Trintignant/Maud scene and the following Trintignant/Franoise scene are treated as differently as can be imagined. After Vidal leaves Trintignant alone with Maud Rohmer stresses the mans awkwardness. He sits in a chair, she lies invitingly on her bed. We rarely see them together in the same shot. They are both isolated from each other (at least through his recollection of the scene). They talk amicably enough, but Trintignant the actors brilliant performance makes clear he would rather be elsewhere and in one brilliant shot he is even depicted as a saint with a light shining from behind his standing form which produces a halo around his body next to a circular painting on the wall. Rohmer seems to be suggesting the fine difference that separates the light of an angel and the flames of hell if he succumbs to Mauds voluptuous beauty. Rohmer refuses to use close-ups throughout the film, but in one shot Maud leans closely into the camera as she talks about her divorce. This is the point clearly of greatest temptation for Trintignant as he remembers this. The later Trintignant/Franoise scene shows a much happier man. He is always close by her side and Rohmer frames them as Trintignant sees them from that point onwards  as a loving couple destined to a future together. In the scene at Mauds apartment conversation takes place with the camera always looking at who is NOT talking, a violation of one of the basic codes cinema has to offer (that the camera must depict who is talking) which stresses Trintignants detached awkward feelings. With the scene in Franoises place we always see who is talking and we are back to safe and harmonious visual representation. Together with his regular cameraman N&eacute;stor Almendros the framing of these interior scenes always seems to comment on the action, the directors hand (as articulated through Trintignants first person narration) always evident in a very subtle way. Exterior scenes are also shot to perfection, the film seeming to emanate out of the environment that surrounds it, especially the snow which perfectly frames Trintignants long night of the soul. Almendros later wrote that some people think Rohmer is in league with the devil, as he predicted the snow that would fall in Christmas 1968, exactly one year after the film was delayed because of the actor Jean Louis Trintignants unavailability. Rohmer even admitted, My films are slaves to the weather.

The careful presentation of the series of dialogs and the way Trintignants character changes throughout the film also mirrors Rohmers depiction of the way his morality is tested and its link with Catholicism. Church service scenes punctuate the film as Trintignant equates his own faith in Franoise with his faith in God, and the positions of both Vidal and Maud as being threats to this faith which puts him on the defensive. Mauds attempted seduction (and Vidals encouragement of it) constitutes an attack on the very core of his being. That is the main reason why he is so uncomfortable (the more attracted to Maud he feels, the more discomfort he suffers) and why he finally relaxes and shows his real self to the devout Catholic Franoise. His spiritual struggle is emphasized even more by the lengthy shots from the back seat of his car as he drives around the Clermont area in pursuit of Francoise on her moped (in pursuit of faith) and in pursuit of a clear direction in life (a wager we are all impelled to make). This becomes a repeated feature of Rohmers other films which often portray characters traveling around searching for some meaning for their lives  the main protagonist in Le Beau Mariage (1981) perhaps being the most mobile of all.

Finally in this wonderful deliciously subtle conversation-piece of a film, we should return to the enormous generosity Rohmer through the narrator-Trintignant shows for his characters. First person narratives usually come with axes to grind, points to be made, scores to settle, but the events of this film are laid out in a highly balanced immensely sympathetic manner with no animosity on display at all. We feel we know each of the characters as they delicately articulate their emotions through things said or left unsaid. Of course the acting is simply terrific. Jean Louis Trintignant is a marvelous actor, but I doubt hes ever been better than he is here (this is a bold statement coming from a huge admirer of his work in films like The Conformist and Three Colors Red). In other hands his refusal to have sex with Maud for reasons of faith would mark him off as a self-righteous prig, but he never comes over that way here, although the transformation in his character is still brilliantly effected. Similarly Franoise Fabians Maud could so easily have degenerated into a base seductress, and yet her intelligence, wit and style are articulated so naturally that we never think of this woman as a man-hunter even if others have sort to do so. Similarly Marie-Christine Barraults Franoise may have been a marriage-wrecker, but her vulnerability is achingly achieved. This is shown beautifully in the final beach scene where she plays with her wedding band as Trintignant explains his meeting with Maud. In one sense we are thinking she is jealous because her husband has just met his former lover, but in another we know that this vulnerability stems from her own guilt at having broken up Mauds marriage. This (and much else in the film) says a lot about the ambiguity of the emotions that Rohmer is so focused on depicting. For him human beings are in the end unknowable. We are all locked into wagers of faith and commitment which may turn bad at any moment. That makes us all fragile, vulnerable and essentially worthy of sympathy and understanding. That is the point from which Rohmers worldview essentially begins and the reason why his films continue to inspire us.

The quality of this DVD is excellent, visuals clean (aspect ratio 4:3) and sound clear. This is a film that rewards repeated viewings. Much of what passes in the dialog is subtle and must be especially penetrating if you can understand French. As far as I can tell the subtitles on this disc are good. We feel we are can understand these characters and sense Rohmers generosity of spirit at every turn. Some people might find this film difficult with its stress on themes religious and philosophic. If you are new to Rohmer Id suggest you try first the later comedies et proverbs or perhaps the altogether lighter and more comic final Moral Tale, LAmour lapr&egrave;s-midi (Love in the Afternoon). None of these are quite as austere as this one deploying as it does long takes, cold grey b/w images, no extradiegetic music and in fact no concessions to anything even remotely commercial. However, nobody interested in the French New can really afford to ignore Ma Nuit chez Maud. Close attention reveals it as possibly this directors finest film.",1428364800,3,18210,5.003629165291983

7797875,5,1572522127,"Like the other moral tales by Rohmer ""Ma nuit chez Maud"" deals with human relationships, love and sex, but  is a little bit more serious than the other moral tales. The protagonist hopes to find a candidate to become his wife. He accidentally meets Maud and they spend the night together dicussing religion, love and sex. Next morning he  meets a girl who he will marry. Rohmer sees life as series of opportunities waiting for catching and happiness which may be waiting round the corner, but you can't hesitate, because it can vanish while you are waiting too long.",1258588800,3,566,4.707070707070707

A movie about those odd conversations we have when we dance around desire, not sure whether to give in or get out. Nuanced to the nth degree, taking its script from situations we all probably recognize, it's a meditative film, ultimately, that offers us a view into ourselves and our desires.

But it's a quiet film (not a single car blows up in its whole duration!) so it might not be a good choice for a plurality of American viewers.

That's not meant as faint praise, not at all. I just mean to say that this is a beautiful film to look at (and the Fox Lorber DVD does it good justice) but, thinky as it is, it maintains a low key throughout that might make certain viewers nervous. Those who are ready for a cerebral film chock full of small insights will love it, though. A product of an era in which the idea of personal ""comprehension"" was interesting and entertaining, ""My Night at Maud's"" is something of a landmark, one that should be better known.",1238716800,3,1003,4.381720430107527
7797877,5,1572522127,"Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as Jean-Louis, a stern Catholic who has wandered the world before settling into a new job at Michelin in the Clermont area of France.  For various reasons, Jean-Louis has never married, and at 34 years he finds himself lonely in this new place.  He chances to meet an old school friend, Vital (Antoine Vitez).  They have drinks and go to a bookstore and chat, primarily about religion and philosophy.  When Vital proposes that they meet up with a newly divorced friend of his, Jean-Louis balks but eventually agrees. Enter the sexy pediatrician Maud.  She attempts to seduce Jean-Louis, who is no nave virgin, but such an interlude may not be within Jean-Louis' personal moral code.  Will they end up together or will Jean-Louis find the nice Catholic girl of his dreams?

""My Night at Maud's"" (1969) is the third in the series of director Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales, following two short films (""The Collector"" was actually made and released third in the series, but is generally placed fourth).  For various reasons, I'm just now getting around to viewing Rohmer's films even though I am a fan of many of the French Wave directors.  To me, Rohmer's films seemed from afar to be less flashy and experimental than the work of Godard or Truffaut.  I've missed out on some great work, such as ""My Night at Maud's.""  His direction and scripting here is impeccable; the film manages to be grounded in stark realism (everything the actors do is perfectly in character) and talky yet somehow glamorous and lighter than air.

Some audiences will be put off by this movie, with its frequent long conversations involving religion and philosophy, focusing on Pascal's Wager.  However, I found that I didn't need to understand the minutiae of these topics (I have read a bit of Pascal years ago), as these conversations exist primarily to show us the characters' moral codes - their sense of what they can and cannot do.  As such, the movie succeeds brilliantly, demonstrating the gray areas of our moral codes that we all encounter.  It's a rare movie that I can walk away from feeling as though I learned something new, yet still assured that I probably only understand 1/4 of it.  Most highly recommended.",1224288000,3,2228,4.839050131926121
7797878,4,1572522127,"I was a bit unprepared for what I saw in ""My Night at Maud's"" (I had anticipated a more festive movie under the mistaken pretense that ""Maud's"" was a night club).  I admit to easing into the extended philosophical discussion of love and similar relationships.  I also found myself enjoying the subtle and not so subtle hypocracy of the participants.  However, this is a comedy in the Shakepearean mode; i.e you may be amused but it's unlikely you'll laugh.  Fair enough, I took it for the candid look at life, love and faith it presented.  I believe that Eric Rohmer's theory is that we can profess to be as open and frank as possible but we still know what to keep to ourselves.  It's a bit heavy in its' dialogue in case you're looking for some lighter entertainment.  However, it's strength is it's dialogue so pay attention and enjoy it.",1194307200,2,841,4.566666666666666
7797879,5,1572522127,"Eric Rohmer's intelligent look at the subject of principles vs. intuition. A mathemetician (Jean-Louis) meets an old school chum (Vidal), a philosopher, and they begin a conversation about Pascal and mind over heart and faithfulness. The conversation continues at Vidal's girlfriend's (Maud) house.

Suddenly our mathemetician is left alone with the Maud, and she invites him to spend the night with her. He accepts but is determined not to sleep with her to maintain his priciples, and in a very funny scene he's successful. After a while he marries Francoise; 5 years later he meets Maud again and learns, by accident, that Francoise was once Maud's husband's lover.

Typical for a Rohmer film, not much happens, but there's lots of talk of a very high quality. But it's not JUST talk - Rohmer is skilled enough not to forget he's making a movie here. He is very on target as his characters explore the topics at hand. It's a very satisfying movie, well worth a watch.",1130198400,2,970,4.837349397590361
7797880,5,1572522127,"Eric Rohmer' s artistic personality has been one of the most original and eloquent. Expressive sobriety supported by a  high caliber humor sense. In this lovable and intelligent work, the seduction issue has never been treated, as an admirable exercise of seduction that links with the purest tradition of the French theater of old ages, plenty of irony, sarcasm and fine charm.

Indeed, the picture is extremely talky, and slow paved in consequence; Rohmer supports on an elegant and smart script plenty of fine intelligence; it's the art of the seduction in its highest order.",1122940800,4,578,5.073684210526316
