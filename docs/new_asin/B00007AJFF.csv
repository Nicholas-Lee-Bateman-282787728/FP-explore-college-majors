1803695,4,B00007AJFF,"Told in a mix of narration and flashbacks, much like the Princess Bride or Forget Paris, this self-conscious genre sendup is part heist movie and part commentary on heist movies.

The plot is engaging but script isn't nearly as clever as it pretends to be, plot holes abound, the twists are more flashy than intriguing, Tim Allen's character's constant movie-quoting eventually grates, and the shadows of Quentin Reservoir Dogs or The Usual Suspects stalk the entire theme.

But for all its simpering in-jokes and posing, there's a sweetness to the film that's diverting and will likely keep you occupied for its length. Decent watch with a group of friends.",1098835200,4,658,5.027522935779817
1803696,4,B00007AJFF,"Trevor Finch's (Christian Slater) life is hanging by a thread as he is taken hostage by Jim (Tim Allen), a skilled hitman.  Jim is a serious enthusiast of classic cinema as he uses lines from different films and complains about the missing magic in current films as he awaits the call for Tout's extermination.  During the wait Finch begins a long story that has a jewel heist, prison escape, beautiful woman, and much more.  The story hooks Jim as he learns about a mistaken identity that might prolong Finch's life.  Who is Cletis Tout is a well-written story with much film history that amuses as it contains both suspense and adventure to keep most audiences entertained.",1087344000,,675,4.793103448275862
1803697,3,B00007AJFF,"For me, the realm of 3-star ratings belongs to films that are worth watching once, don't waste your time by being too long or too stupid, and have enough good moments to hang your hat on....yet the classic 3-star film ruins its own experience too frequently by asking you to accept a bit of business that doesn't make sense, makes a chemistry-poor couple fall in love who hated each other moments before, and otherwise forces your brain to remove itself from the film's created reality and plops you back in your seat saying, ""Wha?!""
This is the case with this mostly cute little film that trades on its own love affair with old-time Hollywood by injecting hit man Critical Jim (Tim Allen) with the same affliction.  It's a quirk that mostly works well, but as he and the leading man (played by Christian Slater) tell the story in flashback, Jim interferes with the story too often.  Breaking down the fourth wall is great if done lightly and occasionally, but here his comments on the behind-the-scenes of filmmaking make the audience think too much about how this film is made, rather than allowing us to get lost in the story.  Homing pigeons also play a crucial role in the story, yet we never get any clue how they know where they're supposed to go in this story, and without an explanation it makes absolutely no sense.
The story itself is clever enough and engaging, and I was never tempted to shut the VCR off, which lifts it above a 2-star dud, at least.  And the ending, or I should say the postscript after the ""guy gets the girl as expected"" ending, is perfect.  Certainly worth a rental, especially now that it's in the cheapo section.",1079308800,,1648,4.591836734693878
1803698,1,B00007AJFF,"Who is Cletis Tout? isn't as bad as they say.  In fact, it's not bad at all for a derivative piece of trash starring Christian Slater and Tim Allen that isn't just one long scene of them emptying their sawed-off shotguns into eachother's hands and feet.",1075161600,2,253,4.5
1803699,4,B00007AJFF,"It's always annoying when movies don't live up to their potential, and it's sad to say that the unimaginatively named ""Who is Cletis Tout?"" is one such movie. The fact is that with its stellar cast, quirky plot, and intelligent dialogue, this movie should have coalesced into something on the level of ""Pulp fiction"" in its perfection. Instead, the movie falls short of such a high level, but the result is still downright enjoyable.
  Christian Slater does a pretty good job of playing Finch, the somewhat worse-for-wear con who impersonates a man more wanted than himself. Portia Di Rossi, in a great departure from her ""Ally McBeal"" past plays an excellent heroine and love interest, giving her role all the spunkiness and freshness that is required. The one who truly shines though (and who elevates the movie's level tremendously), is Tim Allen, as a hitman with a penchant for old movies. The final shot with him doing a quick homage to Gene Kelly is worth the price of admission alone.
  All in all, a pretty good movie, but one that could have been better.",1061337600,2,1064,4.766304347826087
1803700,4,B00007AJFF,"This is a wacky offbeat movie that is an odd mix of romance, action and intrigue.  Christian Slater as Trevor Finch gives another excellent performance as the con man with a computer who escapes only to get caught only to escape... you get the idea.  And when Tim Allen tells him, ""Did anyone ever tell you that you sound like Jack Nicholson?"" I roared with laughter, always having wondered why the two haven't been cast as a father-son duo.  Because there are so many aspects to the film, it's bound to get its share of criticisms that it doesn't hang together or seems to be going in too many directions at once; however, I find the variety entertaining similar to ""Nurse Betty.""  If there's a character flaw, we're not supposed to like a guy who goes around killing people; but Tim Allen is hilarious despite the fact he puts a bullet in people from time to time.  Richard Dreyfuss does a great job for the first two-thirds of the film as the father con-man diamond thief.  And Portia de Rossi is as gorgeous as she was on ""Ally McBeal"" on tv and turns in a great performance as the romantic injenue who loses her father and falls in love with his partner.  I'm not familiar with director Chris Ver Weil's standup comedy, but his comic timing as a director is excellent in this well-paced piece.  I had a real good time with entertaining DVD!  Enjoy!",1055462400,,1353,4.489795918367347
1803701,4,B00007AJFF,I had never seen this movie mentioned anywhere in theaters or DVD.  I loved Tim Allen as a hit man.  That alone makes the movie worth watching it.,1052265600,2,146,4.178571428571429
1803702,5,B00007AJFF,"""Who Is Cletis Tout"" is a smart, funny, low-key caper movie that's in love with movies and a delight to watch. The plot, the characters and the tone all remind me of Donald E. Westlake's novels from the late '60s, books such as ""God Save the Mark,"" ""The Busy Body"" and ""The Fugitive Pigeon."" As a side note, seek out any or all of those novels, and read them; you won't be disappointed if you like comic capers.
The movie is filled with references to other movies (Tim Allen's character, Critical Jim, relates everything to an old movie). One of the less-obvious references includes the ""Pulp Fiction""-like circular structure (note: this film is in no way as violent or profane as ""Pulp Fiction"").
The entire cast appears to really relish their roles and get into the tone of the movie.
On the downside, I rented this, and that's all it's worth as a DVD. The DVD has no extras or commentary or any of the other things that make DVDs collectible (it is, however, presented in widescreen format, one of the best reasons to own a DVD player).",1044576000,6,1039,4.531914893617022
1803703,3,B00007AJFF,"""Who Is Cletis Tout?"" ...  This uninspiredly named film has received very cold treatment in USA, and it seems to have vanished without trace.  Sure, the premise, as I tell you later, sounds like a bad imitation of Quentin Tarantino, but ""Cletis"" has its own virtue that is totally missing in ""Pulp Fiction.""  This film is, in fact, endowed with a much lighter touch and some comedy flavor, and besides a lot of reference to classic movies in Hollywood, this film has, most incredibly, a romantic side that works well.
Christian Slater is Trevor Finch, who is captured by a professional hitman ""Critical Jim"" played by Tim Allen, in a small hotel room.  Now it seems his life is over, but the hitman offers a deal -- tell me your story, and if your story is interesting enough, you might have a chance.  In other word, ""pitch"" me, as screenwriters do before studio executives.  Finch begins his story about how he ended up with the present situation, and the film also follows it with flashback.
The story of Finch, which revolves around his much elder friend in jail Micah Tobias (Richard Dreyfuss) and the stolen diamonds, has so many twists in the course that you might forget about summerizing it.  All I can say is that it involves things like -- fake identity, mistaken target, and the special appearances of Billy Connolly and Rupaul.  Anyway, Finch, Micah, and Micah's daughter Tess join in searcing for the treasure, fending off the gangs and cops alike.
As you may notice, the film is a homage to the genre of crime noir, and its story is far from predictable.  The film takes some very unexpected turn here and there, and shows a very audacious step by introducing an original method of bank robbery (you may smile at it, or you may resent it).  Moreover, some part of the story is too incredible, I admit.
The most elaborated (or pretentious, you may say) part of ""Cletis"" is its reference to old films.  I don't name them simply because most of them are quite famous.  When Tim Allen's hitman refers to the classic films, and he evaluates Finch's story according to the good, old values represented by these classics, you may feel you are living in the age of post-Tarantino genaration.  The fact is, however, the touch of ""Cletis"" is more light-hearted, and though not all references are effective (some are too obvious), the film barely gets away with it, largely thanks to Tim Allen's good performance as acting as a not-so-wicked hitman.
Probably, the best part of the film comes from the romantic side shown most effectively by the portrayal of strong-minded girl Tess, played by Portia de Rossi (known as ""Ally McBeal""s Nell Porter).  Tim Allen's hitman refers to her as a tough girl with a heart of angel, like any Kathleen Hepburn role you pick, and this moviegoing hitman is absolutely right.  Ms. Rossi, lovely and lovable more than ever, is as good as, or probably better than, anything she has shown in that popular TV series, and her fans should not miss it.  The relation between Tess and Finch is sustained by both actors, and you may not believe me, but Christian Slater is surprisingly good as this unlucky but likable small-time crook.
I beleive that with less plot twists and more romance, the film could be better.  Still, ""Who Is Cletis Tout?"" can offer more than you can imagine, if you forget those not-so-effetive film references that might remind you of ... yes, Tarantino again.  But the comparison is quite unfair, because the strength of the film comes from very different quarter.",1036368000,4,3521,4.7254901960784315

7974621,5,B00007AJFF,"This is a great little movie that others have poohed-poohed because of real or imagined flaws.  The things that do work in this film, however, work really well.

The opening scene is strange.  You can't help but wonder where the picture is going from here.  Be patient, you'll find out and the wait as well as the journey are rewarding.

Christian Slater and Richard Dreyfus perform with their usual elan.  The actor who really makes the film, however, is Tim Allen in a very unusual role: a professional hit man.

The music should be issued on a CD -- it's simple, tuneful, and unobtrusive.

Finally, the ending is something you can watch again and again and smile every time.",1187136000,2,677,4.630252100840337
7974622,5,B00007AJFF,"After reading the previous reviews people left for this film, I felt I had to stand up for it. This is one of my favourite films in fact. It is gripping, funny, exciting, sad, thrilling, action packed and highly entertaining. I found that the script and plot were unique and very clever. There are always similarities you can nit pick about movies copying other movies but although this movie is in the 'Pulp Fiction' method of filming the story line is not at all like it or Reservoir Dogs as some reviewers have stated. This is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE FILM. Any person who is not bitter and tyranical as some of these pevious reviewers sound to be will enjoy it immensely, I am absolutely sure of it, and it is an excellent addition to your video library. I've got one and will keep it until the day I die, and have watched it at least 5 times already and my friends love it too.",1147478400,3,878,4.327272727272727
7974623,4,B00007AJFF,"Who Is Cletis Tout? is about a minor league crook and takes on a false identity who happens to be top of the pops for hitman. But the film is not a thriller. It is a light comedy with a mine of stuff about other films laced through it. Tim Allen has his best role to date and it all works well.

Well worth a look.",1102377600,,314,3.757575757575758
