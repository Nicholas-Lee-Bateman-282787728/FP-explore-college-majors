2688050,5,B000KC6SX6,I am recommending this workout to anyone and everyone in my life!  It continues to revoluntionize the way that I exercise.  I actually ENJOY working out to this DVD because it stretches all parts of me.  Not only does it give me a rockin body but it helps me focus on what I most DESIRE in my life.  It activates my mind in a form of dynamic meditation and gives me joy and strength while I workout.  There is nothing else like it out there!,1165449600,18,441,4.141176470588236
2688051,5,B000KC6SX6,"Patricia teaches you how to train your body and mind for success.
Her trick is moving with affirmations.  It stays with you almost like self hypnosis.
She changed my life.
I also teach fitness. Since following Patracia my own classes are now sold out!",1428364800,2,251,4.704545454545454
2688052,4,B000KC6SX6,"OK. Anyone who knows me well would be shocked that I would even request this DVD, must less do it - and forget about enjoying it! It is way more New-Agey than I generally care for and it reminds me of The Secret - a philosophy I don't subscribe to at all. Despite all that, I  enjoy this workout. I would never do it in front of another person, but I love the feel of my workout space when I do it on my own. I do it a spiritual time as well as a physical/workout time when I put in this DVD.

It is one of those workouts that is really difficult to describe though, so I'll give it my best shot. The best way for me to describe it is that is a combination of a simple cardio workout with some toning and balance emphasis married to affirmations and the development of a positive mindset.

The workout is comprised of four segments: warm up, upper body, lower body, cool down/meditation. The segments include mostly low-impact cardio moves that target that part of the body and they are done while you speak affirmation. The moves are all really simple, although Patricia includes appropriate form pointers when you need to pay attention to the moves themselves. She does include some high impact moves, but I just do the lower impact option she covers first.

Upper body: She starts with the arm patterns and then adds in lower-body movement. The arm patterns include scirssoring the arms, arm circles, overhead reaches, and punches. After you get down the physical moves, she adds an affirmation. The affirmations in this section are all very similar and the pattern is easy to learn. This series is repeated several times, including changing the affirmations to statements about myself.

Lower body: The movements include different types of lunges and squats and she adds balance postures. Again, you get the moves down and then you add affirmations. In this case, there are 2-3 different groups of moves with different affirmations. When you put the moves all together (and they are also repeated several times), the different affirmations combine into one longer one.

Like the rest of the workout, the setting is different - I like it. It looks like a loft with dark wood floors and a brick wall at the back. The colors of the decorations (throw pillows, curtains, candles, etc.) are gold and crimson and orange.

I like the music. It is instrumental and seems well suited to the workout. Patricia is backed up by 5 background exercisers, all of whom I watched while doing my moves. Each section can be played individually from the menu or you can Play All. I've only ever started at the beginning and gone until I was ready to stop.

Patricia is encouraging and motivating in this workout. She tells you to focus on your intentions, how you want your life to be, and argues that you can shape the life you want. However, this all means that she talks THE WHOLE TIME. If you want your instructor to not talk sometimes, this is not a DVD for you. Sometimes, she stands still and explains the positive aspect of the affirmations while the background exercisers continue with the moves.

I found this workout to be deceptively challenging. I got a stronger cardio workout than I thought I would. Plus, liked the balance aspect of the workout. The lower-body section was supposed to have some toning aspect to it, but I found that section to give me a cardio effect as well. I ended up sweating through it - not badly, but enough that I knew I had worked out. Plus, I got into the positive-thinking aspect of this DVD and enjoyed starting my day on such a positive note.",1427846400,3,3572,4.577464788732394

2688054,5,B000KC6SX6,"I absolutely LOVE this workout. I had never taken an Intensati class before purchasing this DVD and bought it based on a recommendation from a Kris Carr book (Crazy Sexy Diet- also awesome). This workout is a wonderful mixture of exercise & affirmations- very powerful, invigorating and heart opening. I feel very empowered after and it's a fantastic cardio and strength workout. It definitely sets the tone for your day- Highly Recommended!",1401321600,,441,5.138888888888889
2688055,5,B000KC6SX6,I love this workout... so empowering. You start to focus on your well being and not the sweat ..it really starts my day off right! I only wish the other Intensati classes were on video as well since its easier for me to workout at home.,1401321600,2,236,4.1521739130434785
2688056,3,B000KC6SX6,This was way too hard for me as I am very out of shape.  I think the idea is SO awesome but I think its much more helpful if you have a fitness level to start with and build on.,1400544000,2,177,3.425
2688057,3,B000KC6SX6,"Ms. Moreno has to make more of her time and workouts than this.  The mantra's and affirmations can't come close to that of a live session.  I'm hoping to seek out where and if she will provide an extended or similar version that looks or feels like you're in one of her better classes.  Look her up on Youtube and you will see what a great sell the participants put on the workout.  Too bad I and others didn't find it on this video.  It's a start at least however you might do well to write you're own positive affirmations and just speak them while doing Zumba, Bodypump, or yoga like workouts.  There's more to capitalize on if it's done in person and with others to be sure.",1400544000,2,678,4.2578125
2688058,5,B000KC6SX6,I love this dvd. This workout is intense but when I'm done I am left with a feeling of peacefulness and accomplishment. Patricia Moreno is fantastic!,1397606400,,149,4.769230769230769
2688059,5,B000KC6SX6,"Arrived today and did all except lower body. The upper body workout, wow, are my arms sore! I like the combo of cardio and yoga. I don't see how this DVD could fail to help with endurance. Yes there's lots of talk in the way of affirmations. I'm not used to that, but I did end up liking it. You can always turn down volume but listen at least once. It does help! She asks you to picture yourself at whatever goal you are shooting for and how it feels. As for difficulty I'd say  in average shape but was becoming a couch potato. The warm up is easy but the upper body was lots of fast arm work mixed with some leg moving and squatting. It was hard but not so hard I won't keep doing it.",1393372800,4,687,3.9782608695652173
2688060,5,B000KC6SX6,"Fantastic! If you love law of attraction, yoga and mind body everything, you need to get this DVD. It is fantastic and I've never seen another one like it.",1382918400,,155,4.379310344827586
2688061,3,B000KC6SX6,"The moves on this video are fine, but I had a hard time dealing with the leader talking too much.  She keeps telling us to concentrate on a certain sentence, but she keeps talking and making it hard to concentrate.  I didn't make it through the whole video.",1379289600,2,257,4.333333333333333
2688062,4,B000KC6SX6,Recently I've gotten more into meditation and the attitude of gratitude. This workout combines those with movement. I appreciate the affirmations where some people may find it too new agey. I also love the set and want my workout room to look like this :-). I highly recommend this workout. It's a great way to start or end ones day. I will use this one regularly. Especially on those days when it all seems too much. The only thing I wish was different is chaptering. It would be great to have the option to create your own workout to shorten it on those days you don't have a lot of time. I hope Patricia makes another intenSati dvd.,1375488000,4,635,4.389830508474576
2688063,5,B000KC6SX6,"This is the best workout DVD I have ever done. It is a little unconventional at first but once you get into it, not only are you sweating but you feel so empowered- it is awesome! I did it for the first time yesterday and did get a good sweat going, but the lasting effect of happiness you feel afterward, left me feeling happy not only the rest of the day yesterday but this morning too and I think I slept better as well.

I have tried everything from Slim in 6 (which was too hard for me) to Walk Away the Pounds, to Winsor Pilates Advanced Cardio and this is the only one that is awesome and makes you happy to do it, without feeling like working out is a chore.

Give it a try! You will probably love it.",1374796800,4,709,4.0212765957446805
2688064,3,B000KC6SX6,"I watched a preview of this video on you tube and thought it looked good.  I liked the idea of having positive affirmations said during the workout. Maybe it could change my inner dialog which tends to be self defeating.  I bought the video and watched it today, which I like to do with new workout videos to see what I'll be doing before I actually do the workout.  I am Christian. The chants she uses go against what the Bible teaches. For instance she chants about ""third eye"" and taking about her ""co-creator"".  I hope I can work around this but really wish that, considering that not everyone is of a specific religion, she might be more respectful of other religions and make it more religious neutral.",1371513600,4,708,4.5078125
2688065,5,B000KC6SX6,"Choosing positive thoughts while exercising our bodies is very powerful--especially if you don't like the discomfort of exercise.  In owning about 10 exercise DVD's, this is one of my favorite two.

It pushes a ""reset"" for me if a bit stuck on a problem, too.",1366329600,2,259,4.733333333333333
2688066,1,B000KC6SX6,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would be an intense yoga workout with a spiritual focus that I could use to start out my days on my off-days from working out at the gym.  What I found was an incredibly annoying new-age aerobics video which is highly reminiscent of some kind of cult.

I really really tried to be nice, but after 30 minutes of this video I had to take a break to write this review.

Way too ""new-agey"" like other comments have said.  Yes, I do feel better when I work out, mostly it is just physiological and neurological processes which accompany physical exertion not some kind of spiritual miracle which you have performed via dvd.

Personally, I would not be surprised if all the high-ratings for this video have actually been hypnotized and brainwashed by this video.

To be fair, if you read the horoscope on a daily basis, believe that ""positive"" thinking is scientifically valid, think that wishes are all you need, force yourself to smile in any situation, including but not limited to intense aerobics, worship all things hemp, hope that Vietnamese rice-paddy hats come into style, think organic food can actually save the world, and/or would have loved to drink the kool-aid, then this is your video.

On the other hand, if you are, like me, a rational, skeptical, appropriately cynical and emotionally-balanced human being, this is not the video for you.

Pros

I am sweating; it is an intense aerobic workout.

Cons

There is no warm-up at all; none, nothing, she just starts in the workout at a light pace and then speeds up quick. (and it is not easy)

Her constant talking is much more annoying than actually helpful or motivating

I literally got sick of her saying love, gratitude, and embrace so much I would have been grateful if there was a new-age practitioner nearby because I would have loved their stupid face to embrace my fist.

Hard to follow when you have to mute the video and say ""jesus christ, shut the f@#% up with the bulls$%^!""

The chants are really really weird and creepy, alongside her mindless assistants chanting them over and over.  (Seriously, you want me to repeat these chants and be like those people?!)

I paid for it.",1359504000,3,2184,4.675392670157068
2688067,5,B000KC6SX6,"This is an amazing workout for the mind, body and spirit!  Some may find it a little strange, but I find it amazingly uplifting!  Not only is it great spiritually, but you really work up a good sweat!  I loved this so much that I gave it to my friend as a Christmas gift.  She loves it and does it every day!  The affirmations can really set the pace for a great, positive day, and when practiced long-term, can change your life!!  I highly recommend this!",1358553600,3,456,4.244186046511628

2688070,5,B000KC6SX6,This video has really made a difference for me. The exercises are good for any level. The positive affirmations combined with the movement makes an impression that last all day. If I could do it every morning I would.,1334102400,,217,4.589743589743589
2688071,3,B000KC6SX6,"The exercises were decent. You do feel refreshed after working out. However, the Budda statue was a bit much for me. God as the cosmic butler did not work well either. I found Moreno to be likable. I'd appreciate the dvd more if the religious undertones were removed. If not, I'd prefer to know upfront, so I'd be better informed when making my purchasing decision.",1319760000,3,365,4.630769230769231
2688072,5,B000KC6SX6,This is an intense workout but she works our mind and body all at the same time.  Even if you are not in great shape she tells you how to slow it down and you still feel like you are a part of what she is doing.  I love Patricia Moreno because she has been there with us and she is just sharing how she got past it all to help us.  It does!!  She is wonderful.  It is like you are in her class and she is helping you one on one.,1301356800,4,428,3.5591397849462365

2688074,4,B000KC6SX6,"I have only done the workout about seven times now and i already see a difference in my body. My stomach is flatter, my abdomen is more sculpted, my muscles in my legs are the good kind of sore, much firmer, but best of all my boyfriend says that he notices a difference in my entire attitude! I feel so EMPOWERED!  Sometimes it's difficult to get into this at first, but once you begin to speak to yourself, once you begin to memorize the mantras, you become passionate, you become a part of something. It's challenging but definitely not impossible or easy to give up on. I find myself chanting these words to myself throughout the day. I feel more confident. I feel like i'm finally getting stronger. I just ordered two more of her videos, she's so inspiring and compassionate. YAY!!!",1283299200,9,787,4.542253521126761
2688075,5,B000KC6SX6,"This is more of a movement meditation than a workout, although you will probably become more limber as a result of the doing the work.

2688077,5,B000KC6SX6,"I don't think I could be happier with this DVD. The workout is excellent, and incorporates a lot of good balancing and stretching in addition to the cardio. It's definitely burning calories and releasing those endorphins!

In terms of the inspirational aspect of it, I do find that the affirmations help me stay centered and power through the harder parts of the workout. She chooses some great phrases to use that boost my positive energy and self image. However, they get a little New Age-y for me, sometimes.

Overall, I can hardly complain. I think this is a great DVD, and I find myself feeling physically, mentally, and spiritually relaxed after going through it. I would recommend this in a New York minute to anyone I know.",1271462400,3,731,4.748031496062992
2688078,5,B000KC6SX6,"At last....an exercise video that doesn't require any special equipment and can still deliver a great workout! Not only that, but with the positive affirmations that you learn while doing the workout, you keep yourself in a positive state all day long...I'm really enjoying the Intensati method and started noticing results in the first week....I have already recommended it to my family and friends...it's a method that can be done at any age and any fitness level. Yeah!! Go Intensati!!!",1266537600,3,489,5.125

2688080,5,B000KC6SX6,"I bought this on a whim, and now I love it!  It's a great way to couple the high you get from a good workout with affirmations that urge you to pursue your goals.  I like Patricia's focus and the way she occasionally addresses the viewer, like having a personal trainer in your living room. It takes a little getting used to & makes me feel a bit self-conscious, but I feel so good afterward that it's okay.

The workout seems well-structured, with warmup and cooldown phases.  I wish the pose checks were briefer & that the lower body portion at the end continued for a few more repetitions--I feel like I've just gotten into the rhythm when it's over.

I found this workout at the right moment for me:  I'm trying to work out more regularly, and I've been having trouble working toward my other goals.  I'm hoping she makes more like this!",1250208000,3,841,4.422077922077922

Ms. Schau makes me want to workout everyday.",1210464000,2,313,4.305084745762712
2688084,4,B000KC6SX6,"I gave this DVD 4 stars because of the positive feel good atmosphere it creates.  It starts of with a 5 minute warm up with lots of wonderful affirmations and positive intentions.
The upper arm cardio portion is intense (I wear a heart rate monitor when I exercise I it gets close to my upper limit)  I wish that it were longer that 15 minutes and I wish there was a constant flow from upper body to lower body.  You work out for 15 minutes and stop for about 3.  Too many stops for a cardio workout.
The lower body portion is intense, lots of positive affirmations and gets the heart rate up, but again, there is a lot of stopping so your heartrate goes up and down the whole time.
I would do this as a lifter upper, but if you want a pure cardio workout and not a mind/body workout, try Christi Taylors step/aerobic DVD's..they are great and most can be customized to fit your time constraints.",1201046400,3,896,4.284023668639053

This DVD inspires me and gets me motivated so that when I am doing my other workouts I can remain focused on the task at hand by using the affirmations.  It also helps me in my personal life since I can call upon the affirmations when I am working towards my personal goals.

2688088,1,B000KC6SX6,I didn't like this workout at all. I read all the reviews and don't understand all the high ratings. Not at all what I was expecting.,1184889600,5,133,4.153846153846154
2688089,3,B000KC6SX6,"I loved Patricia Moreno's energy on her two dance dvds: Dance for weight loss & Dancer's body. She gives great cues, detailed, never misses a single important thing to teach & patient teaching. She always show you slow at first so you can understand, then she goes into hyper speed.
This dvd, though I love her, I dislike the moves, they seem to 80s aerobics style with only a hint of yoga, fighting moves, etc. The moves do stretch, but I feel they don't do anything but burn calories.
The 5 min warms up has simple hand movements & a lot of reaching up & down.
The upper body 15 min, has a lot of hand movements, hand jive, fake jump roping, shoulder circles & luckily nice amount of punching though she doesn't give cues on proper punching technique. This is done at hyper speed once learned which means you will drip with sweat like Patricia & the backup men & women do.
The lower body, 20 min, has some balancing, simple kicks (not martial arts kicking) some modified yoga warrior poses, lunges with yoga mudra hands. This is done more slowly for toning & since you'd have to have great balance & coordination of a yoga teacher to do it fast paced.
The end Yoga stretch has triangle, shoulder stretch, wide legged standing fwd bend, twisted sitting pose, butterfly, boat & ends in corpse, meditation with her giving affirmations the entire time. She gives great cuing for proper foot/body placement for all poses.

I love her energy, but she seems a little too earnest & never has any quiet time w/just the music even for 10 seconds. The music is beautiful tribal beat with spiritual harmonics but it kinda only melts into the back of your mind from trying to pay attention to Patricia's constant speaking. I love the words she chooses, but it is better to allow the person to assimilate what you say before speaking more or cheerleading so much.

If you want to increase your body's energy with more modest, normal spoken affirmations/making you aware of your body & increase your constitution, try ""Tantra Toning"", or almost any Kundalini yoga dvd. If you want similar watered-down yoga, boxing, chi kung w/quieter affirmations & but much, much easier pace, try ""YogaBoxing"".
Since it's obvious she's experienced in martial arts & yoga, I'd love to see Patricia do this idea with a little less talking (more like Tantra Toning style) & more emphasis w/o it being watered down of healing arts like yoga, qi gong/chi kung, kundalini, or kick boxing with attention to good posture/technique.

But, once you get into the affirmations (even if you don't believe them wholeheartedly), the workout gets easier and is really fun.  Patricia Moreno is an excellent instructor, and she really helps you get into the chanting and movements.  And the moves, though they are uncomplicated, really work (they left my muscles sore the day after!)  And if you haven't checked out her other two videos, I would highly recommend doing so - they are my favorite workout videos, and I use them regularly to stay in shape, have fun, and escape from my hectic life.

I love her dance DVD too! After reading her feature in Fitness this month, she's even more of an inspiration!",1176422400,3,296,3.933333333333333
2688092,2,B000KC6SX6,"This is really for beginners who want to focus on a few moves.  There is no weight involved.  It's chanting, yoga, and aerobic moves.  I thougt it was going to be life-changing, but it's not.  Borrow it from the library to check it out before you decide if you want to buy it.",1174348800,12,276,4.150943396226415
2688093,5,B000KC6SX6,"I really enjoy this DVD. I hate to workout, this DVD is different, it's a mindy and body workout. When you feel you want to stop the affirmations you say keep you on track. I feel great after the workout and it burns up to 600 Calories in a hour. It may not suit everyone but it works for me!",1174089600,4,292,3.8833333333333333
2688094,5,B000KC6SX6,"I have never enjoyed working out and have never been athletic. In fact, I have always been lazy when it comes to exercise. This dvd is changing my perception. I love the challenge and the sweat. I know that each time I use this dvd, I get better at it and am becoming more coordinated. I love that when I'm doing the exercises, I'm encouraged to think and say positive things rather than to get tired and give up. Because of the amazing feeling this dvd gives me, I try to do it several times a week. Patricia Moreno is an amazing, supportive instructor and I can't wait for her to make more IntenSati workout dvds.",1173571200,8,615,4.310344827586207
2688095,5,B000KC6SX6,"I have purchased over 100 exercise DVDs and this is the first review I've written.  This DVD is revolutionary!  I though I wouldn't want to hear or say the affirmations, but it is so inspirational that I said them and FELT them!  This is a perfect workout to go along with those people that have watched the DVD ""The Secret"" and believe in the power of the Law of Attraction.  It is an hour long and I wished it was longer...it went so fast.  And...YES...it is a cardio workout!  I was sweating! I feel so energized, motivated and happy when I finish this workout!  Thanks, Patricia Moreno...please make more exercise DVD's!",1173312000,14,624,4.5675675675675675
2688096,1,B000KC6SX6,"I am a home-workout fanatic.  I have tried many different videos and read reviews carefully before going out on a limb.  In this case, it was a bad gamble.

First of all, this workout doesn't even qualify as a workout.  It is very overbearing with the new-agey ""spiritual"" stuff.  Even when she's not talking about meditation, there is always an eastern prop of some kind in the foreground.  I am all for ""spirituality"", although mine is not so eastern in nature.  This was SO much it made me nauseous.

While I can appreciate other people's traditions/beliefs, this video did not guide you through your own PERSONAL journey.  It invited you into theirs - which didn't suit me at all.  I was very disappointed.",1172966400,10,710,4.699186991869919
2688097,5,B000KC6SX6,"I love this DVD.  At first I did not believe it to be much of a challenge but with each use, I realized that you can choose how hard you wish to work.  It is very inspiring and with each workout I find myself breaking out into more of a sweat because I'm enjoying it and working myself harder.  I'm looking forward to Patricia coming out with more workout DVD's with the IntenSati method.",1172448000,11,388,4.216216216216216
2688098,3,B000KC6SX6,"I did this  DVD only once so far. I must say it is interesting. It is not like my other yoga workouts. There are some moves that aren't exactly yoga postures. It is however a very positive DVD with all the mantras.. Such as I am strong, I will have all my dreams come true, etc. At first I felt silly saying all these chants. But after the workout I must say I felt pretty good..However if you are looking for a true yoga DVD I don't think this is the one....",1171497600,10,459,3.989130434782609
2688099,5,B000KC6SX6,"I've bought a lot of workout dvds before, and not many seem to give me enough of a challenge nor break a real sweat.  This dvd finally gave that to me. It's a great cardio workout, plus helps your mind by testing your balance and coordination. Plus, when I feel like I need to sit down, those aspirations help give me the strength to continue.  The upper body & lower body workouts are a great challenge for me as far as testing my coordination & cardio strength. I love the motivation that comes with it all!  I'll keep this in my collection forever.",1171065600,20,551,4.330097087378641
2688100,4,B000KC6SX6,"I bought this workout simply for the amazing amount of calories you can burn in an hour.  I love the lower body workout it offers and the positive affirmations.  However, I don't really care for the cardio portion.  I do the entire video, but would like to have a more challenging cardio portion.",1169856000,8,296,4.547169811320755

8155504,4,B000KC6SX6,"Enjoy the exercises plus the positive energy flow. I do feel like I had a pretty good workout plus I feel calm and de-stressed afterwards.
The chants take some getting used to but will motivate you to keep going.
 It is a workout plus yoga class all in one!",1493683200,2,257,4.244897959183674
8155505,1,B000KC6SX6,"I reviewed the contents and noted that she offers ""life coaching"" and then watched the first three minutes and, when she started her affirmations--""I co-create my reality""--I took the DVD out, placed it in its cover and threw it in the trash. What is this? Werner Erhard meets aerobics? This is out of scope of practice for personal fitness. What a crock.",1485216000,,355,4.741935483870968
