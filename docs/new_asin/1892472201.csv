This was a perfect gift for our friend, especially since he got to experience some of the beautiful North Shore with a quick trip to our cabin (complete with  MN blizzard)!",1397865600,,339,4.633333333333334
7801039,5,1892472201,"Those of us who dwell in the center of the continent above the 45th parallel take great consolation from Lake Superior, our inland sea.  A trip to the North Shore is much like a trip to another place entirely with water that stretches beyond the horizon and weather that submits to the massive presence of this lake.

We purchased this DVD on one of our trips up north because Mr. Blacklock is a landscape photographer with a tremendous body of work that artfully portrays this region we love.  The DVD exceeded our expectations.  In fact I wrote to Craig describing his wonderful work as ""Kinetic Photography"".  His artistry, sensitivity to his subject and uncanny ability to capture the mood of the place is truly remarkable.

Any time you pause this DVD you are presented with a magnificent still photograph.  If you love the North Shore, are curious, or simply what to experience a new art form, buy this DVD.",1362441600,,913,4.70440251572327
