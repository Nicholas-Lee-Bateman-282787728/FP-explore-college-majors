8252573,4,B0013QOVN2,Enjoyed the video. I haven't got my lab puppy yet but getting ready. I will get my new puppy in a few days. I got this video used and had to laugh when it arrived. the case on one corner was pretty well chewed by probably the puppy someone was trying to train. Hope it was successful. The video itself was not hurt and worked fine.,1466899200,,331,4.03030303030303

8252579,1,B0013QOVN2,General discussion of training a hunting pup. Not enough specific examples of technique. Too much talk and not enough pictures. This is a dvd.,1361404800,,142,4.958333333333333
