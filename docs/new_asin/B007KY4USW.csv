5094182,5,B007KY4USW,"I have been going to concerts for about half a century and have yet to see a live performance of Bruckner's fifth symphony.  However, having seen both the DVD and Blu-Ray of this Summer 2011 performance by Claudio Abaddo and his Lucerne Festival Orchestra, I believe that this clear and crisp video with excellent sonics comes close to what I've missed by not having seen a live performance. Great Bruckner conductors have the ability to create a sense of unity across these massive four-movement works, instill a pulse that links the great outbursts, the lyrical outpourings, the luftpauses, while at the same time  avoiding the impression of a series of disconnected episodes. And Abaddo and this exceptional group of players achieve this in remarkable fashion.  Watching Abaddo conduct, without a score as with all of his Lucerne Festival videos and his Beethoven symphony cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic, I cannot help but think about how it must have been a shock to the Berlin Philharmonic musicians when Abaddo took over the podium following the death of Herbert Von Karajan.  In this video of his performance of the Bruckner fifth, his emotion-conveying facial expressions, his continuous eye contact with his players, is in marked contrast to his distinguished predecessor in Berlin who conducted in a precise and controlled manner, but with eyes closed and with a facial expression that conveyed little if any of the emotional content of the work he was conducting.  It is sad that Bruckner was never able to attend an orchestral performance of this masterpiece, and maybe it is fortuitous that he was too ill to attend the premier of his fifth symphony in Graz, conducted by Franz Schalk who had secretly adulterated the score, changing the orchestration and inflicting massive cuts, especially in the finale.  Abaddo and his Lucerne Festival players perform magnificantly in all four movements.  The pizzicato strings that open three of the four movements are beautifully played as are, in movement 1, the tutti, chorale, gesangsperiode, the unique use of themes from the introduction as ""dividers"", development and recapitulation of the principal theme of the first movement which, typical of Bruckner, appears at the conclusion of the 4th movement coda to create a sense of unity spanning the entire symphony.  The two themes of the binary-form adagio are beautifully played, the A  theme with its dramatic falling sevenths, the B theme, a soaring melody, one of the most attractive themes Bruckner composed, and the rustic scherzo, featuring a speeded up version of the A theme from the adagio. And the finale which Bruckner labored over, an amazing creation combining sonata form (incorporating Bruckner's innovation of 3 themes) and fugue.  These fugal sections are emotionally powerful, truly exciting--the fugue based on the first theme of the 4th movement with its dramatic octave drop, the fugue on the chorale theme (3rd theme), the double fugue based on the chorale and first theme, and the double fugue on the first themes of movements 1 and 4, leading to the coda with a triple fugue following the dramatic entry of the chorale,and, of course, the final wrap-up with the main theme of the first movement, uniting the entire symphony.  This is a marvelous performance and I recommend it highly.",1346630400,16,3321,5.108856088560886
5094183,5,B007KY4USW,"I first encountered Bruckner in the early 60's, and have had Bruckner ""phases"" ever since, unlike Mahler, of whom I have been a constant devotee since that same time. My initial Bruckner opus was the sixth symphony, his most succinct, and which has remained my favorite since those days(great tunes, well integrated). From there I branched out to earlier and later works. The fifth has always been the toughest nut to crack for me.

Listeners first encountering this 5th. symphony, if they were familiar with other Bruckner works, could be forgiven for thinking that the first movement in particular was constructed from discarded pieces of melody from earlier symphonies, strung together with no overall plan in mind. Certainly, the developmental agenda is not obvious. However, things seem to get more cogent as the movements progress, although there are still instances where beautiful little snippets of melody are left hanging without resolution.

Abbado does a pretty good job of hanging all this together - no mean feat for what must be a devilishly difficult conducting assignment. Just watch how he creates the little nuances in rubato and volume.

Gerhard Knapp in his review has doubts about the Lucerne orchestra being the ideal Bruckner orchestra, and I know what he means, although I think it's more the hall than the orchestra. If you listen during the brass chorales, you can tell the Lucerne hall, being narrow and relatively low-ceilinged, has a short decay time, thereby making it hard for the music to breathe in the Bruckner ""cathedral of sound"" manner. Compare this recording to, say, the Bruckner 7th, recorded by Welser-Most and the Cleveland Orchestra in Severance Hall. The difference in reverberation, and therefore fullness of sound, is quite marked.

That being said, the performance here is very good, as is the recording of it in this hall. The sound just comes across as a little clinical - you can't really bask in it. Video quality is excellent in bluray.

The only other video of this symphony that I have seen is by Wand, which is rendered obsolete by this version. On You Tube, you can see Barenboim's effort (looks and sounds pretty good) together with the 4,6,7,8 & 9, all with the Berlin RSO, and purported to be released sometime henceforth on bluray. These were apparently all performed and recorded within a one week period in Berlin. I frankly don't know how a conductor or orchestra can absorb and perform all this music optimally in such a short period. But the release could be a best-seller if it is priced competitively as a bluray set. They can probably squeeze the whole thing onto two discs.

So, if you like Bruckner 5, you'll love this disc. If you're new to it, try it and be prepared to invest a little time getting to know it. This is not a piece to absorb in one sitting.",1341446400,8,2829,4.846790890269151
5094184,5,B007KY4USW,"Bruckner's Fifth Symphony, composed during a troubled time in the composer's life,  was competed in 1876 and had its first orchestral performance as late as 1894. Compared to the the more free flowing Fourth Symphony, this longer work can seem more episodic, rambling and even experimental. Heard in this superb performance by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra under the direction of Claudio Abbado, it sounds magnificent.

While Abbado's interpretation is certainly not barnstorming, neither is it limp wristed. Although utilizing a large orchestra Abbado approaches many aspects of this work more as a piece of chamber music-thus the subtleties of the wind and brass writing are gloriously displayed. His hand picked orchestra plays flawlessly and the whole symphony is expertly paced. While Gunther Wand's DVD version is also noteworthy , its filming is somewhat dated and the performance is less coherent than Abbado's.

Listening and watching on a decent home theater system I found the warm and clear sound perfectly acceptable. The performance is additionally well filmed. Highly recommended.",1337731200,10,1096,5.511904761904762
5094185,4,B007KY4USW,"Bruckner's Fifth Symphony is a difficult piece to bring off: episodic and at times almost disjointed and lacking the inner drive and structural cohesiveness of its siblings. It seems that the composer, after the glorious Fourth, was trying out both new and traditional venues (an abundance of counterpoint) and exploring formal innovations which not always quite jell. As a whole, the symphony needs a firm grip on its development and, moreover, a stress on some of its proto-modern features in rhythm and harmony, in brief: sharp contours to the many outbursts and a loving hand with the lyrical passages. For me, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski's 1996 CD recording with the Saarbrcken Radio Symphony Orchestra delivers all this, and more. On DVD, Gnter Wand (in dated video and audio) is fine, Franz Welser-Mst with the great Clevelanders more incisive, though sometimes hampered by the reverberant acoustic of St. Florian.

Abbado's recording has received much praise elsewhere, and I gladly agree that his is a very special reading, full of warmth and sensitivity to the composer's mood swings. I do not quite concur with Ian Giles regarding the problems with the recording's dynamic range he experienced: I listened (with headphones) to both soundtracks and, yes, the dynamic range is wide and some piano passages are low in volume indeed, but all in all the dynamics are not out of line for me. The video is very good, so is the audio, up to today's very best standards (see C Major!). As to the interpretation, I don't find the Lucerne Festival Orchestra ideally suited to Bruckner's idiom and his sonorities. At times I sensed some tentativeness in ensemble or intonation, too subtle to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps this is due to Abbado's rather genteel approach to the score which is not quite apparent in the powerful first movement and the beautifully melodic adagio, but in the scherzo where I would wish for a more ferocious delivery (and, as the composer wants, no slowing down in the trio) and in the finale which is not quite overwhelming or, if you like, apocalyptic enough for my taste. All this is admittedly a very subjective response to what must be considered a great performance overall. You may disagree with my quibbles and I'll be happy to hear from you.",1337040000,20,2270,4.973684210526316

8519210,4,B007KY4USW,"Always grandiose Bruckner conducted by a very accurate Abbado, great of course but a little lack of passion, obviously a very sick man. Very glad though to own now this recorded live performance.",1472774400,,195,4.9393939393939394
8519211,3,B007KY4USW,"The last five minutes of this Blu-ray of a concert from the 2011 Lucerne Festival consist of applause, fading out only after members of the orchestra have left the stage and Claudio Abbado returns once more to acknowledge the acclaim that might well have gone on for several more minutes. Audiences at Lucerne loved Abbado, and why not? The man brought much pleasure in his lifetime of music-making, and with the serious illnesses he had already endured, his admirers knew his remaining time was not long.

The applause, then, is for Abbado. The performance of the Bruckner Fifth Symphony is coincidental.

I have a lot of respect for Abbado's musicianship, going back to the late 1970s and his recording of the Brahms Second Piano Concerto with Maurizio Pollini, which I have on both CD and DVD, and Verdi's Simon Boccanegra (I still have Deutsche Grammophon's first CD issue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Simon-Boccanegra/dp/B000001G6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Simon Boccanegra</a>&nbsp;of that opera, on behalf of which Abbado's efforts gave a big push).

That's quite a range -- from Beethoven to Berg -- for any conductor.

If you're a fan of Abbado's and a collector of his body of work, you might like this Bruckner Fifth. It's played cleanly. On Blu-ray, the audio is clearer and balanced more naturally than the sound on Accentus Music's Blu-ray of Barenboim's 2010 Bruckner Fifth&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anton-Bruckner-Symphony-No-5-Daniel-Barenboim-Staatskapelle-Berlin-Blu-ray/dp/B00CFEFM8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anton Bruckner: Symphony No. 5 - Daniel Barenboim & Staatskapelle Berlin [Blu-ray</a>]. The video is sharper, too. Abbado's is not a bad performance. It just doesn't sound like Bruckner. This could be quality music from any number of late 19th century composers whose works are neglected -- Joachim Raff, for example.

The liner notes describe Abbado's way with this music as ""elegant"" and ""cosmopolitan."" Those are not two of the first 100 adjectives I would think of to describe the Bruckner Fifth. Is a volcano in the Andes elegant? Is the Horsehead Nebula cosmopolitan? The Bruckner Fifth is a colossus, one of the goliaths of symphonic literature. You wouldn't know that if this were your first exposure to it. Abbado never immerses himself in the symphony as he did in Wozzeck. It's all from the outside, at arm's length, and you can see that detachment in the orchestra. With only a few exceptions, each player is concentrated on his or her sheet music, isolated, sometimes a little bored perhaps -- until the music's over and they can shake hands and hug and go out for dinner and an apritif. This night, it was all about the occasion, not about Bruckner.

If I'd been at this Lucerne event, I'd have been standing and applauding, too. But for Abbado, not for Bruckner. I'd rather remember those recordings of Abbado's that will remain landmarks as long as reviews of classical music are written. This Bruckner Fifth, unfortunately, isn't one of them.",1450051200,2,5695,7.343108504398827
8519212,3,B007KY4USW,"Even if you're an atheist or agnostic there's one deity who existence cannot be denied: Zeitgeist. Omnipotent indeed are its powers. Attribute omnipresence to it too. It takes bravery to defy its hegemony. Claudio Abbado - Mister Nice - was not such a man. Sad though it was, he limped doggedly after the period practice wolfpack in the last decade of his life - to no vivid end.

A critic from the Neue Zcher Zeitung described Uncle Claudio's Bruckner Fifth as follows: ""Abbado's approach to the music of Bruckner is soft and songlike, at times tense and urgent but constantly filled with warmth of feeling."" This is accurate enough even if it gives away the game. Most if not all of Bruckner's symphonies are a reckoning with God. The Fifth in particular could be likened to the stained-glass windows of Chartres Cathedral, proclaiming the history of salvation from Genesis to the Book of Revelation. You won't find any of that in this well-filmed, superbly recorded performance of the Fifth - that would be too sectarian. It might exclude someone. Litigation could be forthcoming. Should we run a disclaimer at the start of this performance and urge the viewer to consult their health-practitioner? Having erased the horizon, let's mute Bruckner's longing for the infinite. We know better. All gods are dead (when we bother to think about it).

To a more mundane consideration: notwithstanding the fact that a very large orchestra is in play, it's surprising how little torque is generated by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra (Abbado's fetish for the Via Media is no doubt in play).

Bottom-line: this is another antiseptic, easy-on-the-soul instalment of Bruckner Lite (and on this very point I'm in full agreement with my friend Mogulmeister who has penned a perceptive review of this same performance). If you're comfortable with this approach, clover awaits you. Celibidache - that disreputable old reactionary - provides a Fifth with more metaphysical kick to its name.

It begs the question: where do you fit in the scheme of things?",1435795200,,2040,5.0266272189349115

8519216,2,B007KY4USW,"This is certainly an improvement over Abbado's previous recording of Bruckner's 5th symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic.  Yet as well-played as this Lucerne performance is, anyone who is interested primarily in Bruckner's monumental 5th symphony, instead of Claudio Abbado's ""Lite"" version of Bruckner's 5th symphony, will likely find this performance fundamentally lacking.

Other reviewers have correctly pointed out that Abbado takes a ""genteel"" approach to the symphony, and does not turn it into a reverential ""church"" as one might hear in the great performances of Karajan, Jochum, and Celibidache, among others.  I think those are astute observations.  Yet what that means, to my ears at least, is that Abbado fundamentally ""misses"" what this music is all about, and most importantly the spirituality that is at the center of it.

If one needs a ""Lite"" version of Bruckner's 5th (and by the way, that's an oxymoron), then one is probably missing the entire point of the work in the first place.  And if you like your Bruckner shorn of the spiritual/metaphysical element, then this is the performance for you.  But isn't Bruckner without the spirituality sort of like Beethoven's 6th reinvisioned as an outing to the mall?

The orchestra is wonderful and the two-star rating is entirely for the quality of the playing.  But to what end?",1408752000,5,1344,5.185185185185185
8519217,5,B007KY4USW,"I was introduced to Bruckners Fifth in the late 1960s with Eugen Jochums monumentalized approach at a live concert, and then on his LP set.  Jochum notoriously halved the tempo at the end of the fugue, yielding a double augmentation of the chorale.  This grand broadening, along with a doubled brass section almost allowed the scent of valve oil to drift like a veil over the first few aisles.  I was blown away, as was much of the audience.  I felt after such grandeur, that any other approach was sacrilegious and weak.
Since then, Ive heard many performances, and now appreciate this work in more modest garb.  However, Abbados nuanced and refined reading stands alone as the most transparent and lyric interpretation Ive heard.  The Lucerne Festival Orchestra has a uniquely international sound:  one cannot really say the brass is German or the winds French.  Each solo is imparted with a polished sheen, expressive, yet fastidious.  Abbado lets the musical events unfold on their own with a reverence for the score, eschewing grandstand plays.  I had to forget the cathedral of the past.
I still love to turn up the volume on my Jochum and recall the thrill I experienced over forty years ago, but I would place this exquisite performance above the rest.",1391731200,3,1260,4.845794392523365
