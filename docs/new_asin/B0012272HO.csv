8243558,5,B0012272HO,A picture is worth a thousand words.  Good companion piece to the Mandrell book on tube flies.  Buy these together.,1369267200,,115,4.7
8243559,3,B0012272HO,"A very good, detailed instruction for tube fly tying.  The downfall, only 5 patterns with little variation among the 5.  Would like to have had more patterns/tying methods to view.  Also would be nice to have some sources for tube flies materials mentioned.  Little pricey for what you get.",1264118400,2,290,4.857142857142857
