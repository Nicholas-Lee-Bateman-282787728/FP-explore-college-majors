8673267,1,B00MNRAANA,"Complete rip off! -- ""The Missing"" isn't an original dvd. Someone filmed it with a handycam! The picture jerks around and is so distracting you know it's a fake. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! -- Also, ""The Three Burials..."" -- is a terrible movie! It's been on my list 'to see' for a long time, because I love Tommy Lee Jones, but this was just awful! It's the western version of ""Weekend at Bernie's"". Disappointing combo overall... I do hope the 'powers that be' release ""The Missing"" on Blu-ray. It is a truly wonderful western.",1524009600,,526,4.5473684210526315
