2750531,3,B000MV8AD6,"I love Zombie movies and this one had some kinda new twists on the old theme that I liked,it was unique and worth watching. Not a big budget and a lotta wholes in the plot, but pretty pleasant concept.",1198281600,,201,4.17948717948718
2750532,1,B000MV8AD6,"Lots of people apparently consider this movie ""fun"".  Lots of people apparently consider this movie ""good"".  What am I missing?  This is a made-for-cable ""zombie/buddy comedy/romance"" that is nothing more than bland crap.  It's about as cutesy and stupid as you can get.  Says a lot about what kind of movies people seem to like anymore though, I guess.  1 out of 5, ptoeey.",1187827200,,374,4.765625
2750533,4,B000MV8AD6,If you're a Dean Cain fan or you enjoy the Sci Fi Saturday night movies you'll probably like this. What do zombies and scorpions have to do with one another find out for the first time here. The movie doesn't seem to take itself to serious and has a fun tone. If you only like Romero zombies or Fulci zombies or even today's fast moving living dead this movie will not be your thing. If you like to mix it up and not have high expectations Dead and Deader will probably surprise you in some spots.,1186012800,,497,4.1875
2750534,1,B000MV8AD6,"I seen this movie about a month ago and I really wish I could have that hour and a half of my life back. There was nothing scary, or creepy about this movie.",1184803200,,157,3.787878787878788
2750535,4,B000MV8AD6,"...first of all Dean Cain is a horrible actor, he is so bad in this movie it is hilarious. Well you already know the story (read the amazon description). This movie is hilarious, it is not meant to be a serious zombie flick ala Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" but I highly recommend this one if you are a fan of the zombie genre or horror comedy. A worthy addition to your library.",1177286400,,372,4.253521126760563
2750536,3,B000MV8AD6,"To put it bluntly, DEAD AND DEADER manages to barely rise above that prevailing cinematic sludge of tired, played-out, low budgeted zombie flicks. A 2006 Sci-Fi Channel original movie (something this film shouldn't really take pride in), this one offers nothing new but still isn't all that bad as far as horror features go. It's certainly gory enough as limbs and other body parts are torn pretty indiscriminately and frequently. Dean Cain, far removed from his LOIS & CLARK glory days and, it seems, also far removed from a 24 Hour Fitness gym, rises above his acting resume and provides a dazzlingly mediocre turn as the show's undead hero. It's a good thing he brought funnyman Guy Torry with him, who provides wingman duties and those traditional sidekick jokes. Incidentally, Star Trek actors are in deeper financial straits than I thought if they've sunk to popping up in low budget servings such as this (John Billingsley and Armin Shimerman).

Not to make a lame zombie pun, but here come the SPOILERS. When a Special Forces combat unit does a recon at a Cambodian site which has lost contact with headquarters, the soldiers shockingly encounter ravenous, flesh-eating creatures. They engage the ghouls only to be rapidly overwhelmed. The only survivor is Lieutenant Bobby Quinn (Dean Cain), whose body is recovered and is pronounced DOA. However, Quinn revives just before he's buzzsawed into for autopsy, to the medic's casual disbelief. After Quinn uses a scalpel to carve a scorpion out of his forearm and after the forearm subsequently heals itself, Quinn and the medical officers begin to smell something funny (and, no, it's not the forearm).

Suffice to say, Quinn very rapidly realizes he's become part zombie and is now endowed with superstrength and a healing factor. And, as long as he chomps down on some raw, red meat every now and then, he's copacetic. Of course, he does still sport that pasty complexion and still has a tendency to spew green blood. The rest of the negligible plot involves Quinn, a wisecracking military mess cook (Guy Torry), and a feisty bartender honey (Susan Ward) battling the undead as they strive to curtail the spreading zombie infection.

There isn't one original note here, not one. When the movie doesn't have its military characters reduced to spouting trite phrases such as ""Stay frosty,"" it indulges in uninspired B-movie cliches. The special effects and stunts are universally cheesy, the dialogue corny, the acting performances pretty ho-hum (although Susan Ward is very, very nice to ogle at). But, having said all that, DEAD AND DEADER isn't all bad. Lower your expectations - or, realizing that it's a Dean Cain feature, maintain your normal level of expectations - and you'll be fine. Just stay frosty. Viewers will either enjoy Torry's one liners or be irked by them. To me, though, the film's funniest line isn't from Torry. It occurs when Quinn almost gobbles down his cute bartender friend and he apologizes by saying, ""You know what they say, the fastest way to a man's heart is thru his stomach."" I give this one two and half rotting and infectious stars.",1170460800,15,3125,4.959923664122138

8173069,3,B000MV8AD6,"I will have to say that the first half of this movie was pretty good and then they did some weird mad scientist thing and it went downhill from there. The first half had humor about a zombie topic. Dean Cain is a soldier who goes overseas with 3 of his men and they come upon a shack with scientists that are for want of a better term flesh eaters. It blows up and well the 4 men are affected too. Cut to the autopsy in the states, Dean wakes up and well things happen from there. Dean, is not bad, and has some pretty funny stuff as does his sidekick in the movie Guy Torry, later we meet the female presence and she is Susan Ward also pretty good. Now as for the rest of the cast some good and most not too good. AS I said I was having fun til a mad scientist and his crew take Dean for his longevity and then it gets stupid. So 50-50 on this one. I leave that up to you, I can recommend the first half but then........",1495843200,,921,3.904255319148936

8173071,5,B000MV8AD6,"As a Susan Ward fan, this is a nice little campy flick, nothing flashy, goofy lil movie
with both horror of zombies and cheeky comedy,  but  hey, Susan looks fantasic & I had to add it to my collection",1367366400,,201,4.128205128205129
8173072,5,B000MV8AD6,"OK honestly this really was a sleeper Zombie flick, it had everything in it that makes it a classic B-Movie. Dean Cain was great as was the supporting cast, it was gory very gory and funny what's not to love about that?! Any Zombie fan should pick this movie up. Way better than some of the trash that's being made or has been made lately.",1341360000,,339,4.230769230769231
8173073,5,B000MV8AD6,"Once this zombie flick gets going, it is really quite funny, thanks mostly to great one liners and a dry delivery by Dean Cain. Only major weaknesses are a slow moving intro (during a military mission) and a claustrophobic zombie-attack climax that feels cliche (and shows the tight budget constraints). Otherwise, this is one zombie movie fans will mostly likely enjoy.",1316044800,,370,5.081967213114754
8173074,5,B000MV8AD6,I didn't think Dean Cain could make a good zombie flick but I was mistaken. I highly recommend this one.,1297468800,,104,4.25
8173075,3,B000MV8AD6,"There is so many zombie stinkers out there its incredible, but this movie
rates a little higher.  I was ready to view this film and eventually fast
foward to the end as i do for most stinkers, but after seing the beginning
and some original material like the crawly little things inside the zombies
i continued to watch it.  After a while you could feel the movie changing
from serious to not too serious,, a joke here and there and then the next
transformation to a buddy movie...the bartender honey (Susan Ward ) , the
sidekick (the cook) and our main actor.
  So its quite a mix, and most will work. The gore is done good, the
zombies are pretty good also.....  The film won't win any award but
has won my patience for 90 minutes or so. ( i really did not like the
way the film went with the buddy thing with the bartender, great looking
but it still took away some of the darkness of the film and changed it
to funny pink.......
good for a rental...a keeper if you collect zombie films.",1225152000,,990,4.301075268817204
8173076,5,B000MV8AD6,"Dead and Deader, I have to say, is a really good movie for what it is. This movie has tons of action and that is the most important thing you want in a zombie movie. It also has a nice taste of comedy as well. The cast is also really great. You got Dean Cain, but also other famous people such as John Billingsley and Armin Shimerman (of Star Trek fame).If you are a zombie fan, you should check this out. How often do you see a movie where a zombie is a good guy? This is a lot better than some other B rated movies to come out recently like Return of the Living Dead 4 and 5. True, it doesn't take much, but this movie is WAAAAY better than House of the Dead, and that crappy movie came out in theaters!",1220140800,,705,3.937062937062937
8173077,2,B000MV8AD6,"I am a Dean Cain fan so of course I had to check this movie out for myself.  While Dean Cain's character is shown throughout the entire movie, the only time I actually get to see the Dean Cain ""acting"" that I feel in love with is not until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The ending of the movie was totally stupid!  There are a few dumbass puns in the movie.  I don't know who wrote this crap of a movie, but my biggest thought/questions is: Why Dean! Your career started out so well with Superman and while you have had a fewnot so good ""B"" scifi movies, I still had hope, but this movie is the biggest joke of your career.  I still like Dean Cain but would defently never want to hear or see of this movie again!  Dean, stick to what you are good at, action,...not this crap!

Oh and the ""gore"" in this movie is completely ridiculous!!!",1209513600,,841,4.128834355828221
