8239544,4,B0010YSD7C,"The characters feel right...the way that you would expect them to be from reading the comic books.  I suppose it would have been more interesting, if the characterizations went a little deeper than their well-defined roles, but, hey, it's an animated adventure.  Also, there is a lot of recurrence of the same villains across all of the these Fantastic Four volumes.  My only real complaint, though, is that I am not a fan of this type of art, which makes all of the characters' chins pointy.  What's the point of that, anyway?",1443139200,,527,4.695652173913044

8239546,3,B0010YSD7C,Didn't realize that this volume had episodes I already had in Vol. 1. But that was my error. Otherwise it was fine.,1377993600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8239547,5,B0010YSD7C,"Super Heroes? Fantastic heroes is more like it. This Dvd set is full of FF episodes that you can watch if you have a dvd player. Don't try to put a dvd in a vcr though because it won't work. However, you do not need a dvd player or a vcr to look at the pictures on the dvd cover.
Awesome!",1229904000,,288,3.737704918032787

8239549,3,B0010YSD7C,"The Volume 3 is good. In some parts, Jhonny's flames are not so good. They made too much transformation on Ben's costume. My favorite episode is with Ironman.
