If you are curious about Biblical miracles, these will serve you well. You won't easily find this much information elsewhere.",1373155200,,300,4.788461538461538
8523765,4,B0080RBACC,"We have not watched all the videos yet, but especially like the one on the Exodus across the Red Sea.  The only other one we've watched so far is the Gates of Jerusalem.  It was a bit long and tedious, but did contain interesting information.  I think we'll enjoy all these as we have time to watch them.",1357084800,,304,4.206896551724138
