3447043,4,B001AD54TS,A Peter Wimsey film with credit for writing to Dorothy Sayers.  Wimsey was always quirky but a little too much in this film.  But still worth watching.,1446249600,2,151,4.555555555555555
3447044,3,B001AD54TS,Mediocre film noir.,1431820800,,19,5.666666666666667
3447045,3,B001AD54TS,"I thought this was one of the better movies of its type I have watched on Amazon Instant Video. (By ""its type,"" I mean ""previously unknown to me, B picture, and oldish."")

I thought the mystery elements -- the unraveling  of ""who done it"" and the clearing of the innocent party -- were well-plotted and interesting. And since that's the main part of the movie, that meant the movie was interesting for me. The drama and fighting and capturing-the-criminal parts were exciting.

I have seen Peter Haddon in another movie, and I like him. He has a rather fey, abstracted persona (if I know what ""fey"" means * ), and he gives people the impression he's a fool -- perhaps intentionally, like Zorro, or the Scarlet Pimpernel, or maybe like Peter Falk as Colombo. Being taken for a dummy works to his advantage. Anyway, I liked him as Lord Peter Wimsey. Others may differ.

All in all, I liked the whole tone of the movie, the interplay between various characters, and the whole package. A pretty good old mystery.

* I just looked up ""fey."" It means ""giving an impression of vague unworldliness"" -- that's Haddon's persona, all right. Kind of like Charles Butterworth, or maybe Roland Young.",1430438400,4,1186,4.6826923076923075
3447046,5,B001AD54TS,Older films are the best! came quickly and in great condition. Just as advertised.,1430006400,,82,4.928571428571429

3447048,1,B001AD54TS,"This was NOT produced in 2008, as described.  This is a REALLY old movie.  OK if that's what you like.  Didn't watch.",1421884800,,117,4.2272727272727275
3447049,4,B001AD54TS,Rather interesting Lord Peter Wimsey story by Dorothy L. Sayers. Blackmailer gets his and killer deceives everyone but Lord Peter into thinking he's a detective.,1421020800,,161,5.48
3447050,5,B001AD54TS,"Awkward film making but extremely well thought out plot for a one hour ""show"". Probably made for TV.
Love the name: Sinister Cinema.
And the good guys win in the end.",1389398400,,166,4.387096774193548
3447051,2,B001AD54TS,"Love British mysteries. Love old movies. Didn't care for this one at all.

Originally filmed in 1935, this must have been a 2008 re-release of this Sayers story. I don't want to be too harsh.  A film buff or a Wimsey fan may find this to be great, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",1361750400,2,281,4.0
3447052,3,B001AD54TS,I thought the plot interesting and I liked the scene where the engine went through the door.  The effect was well done.  The portrayal of Lord Peter was strange.  He was presented as an idiot rather than the sophisticated detective in most of his cases.  This puzzles me.,1322179200,8,271,4.583333333333333

8276759,1,B001AD54TS,"The Silent Passenger delivered nothing.  Even for $1.99, I feel swindled.  The sound and visual delivery of this
film is so poor that it can't be taken seriously.  There should be some warning about how old this film actually is.
When we looked at the entry point, the year was 2008 which is totally misleading.  How about one of the first years
that film used sound?",1502064000,,367,4.515151515151516
8276760,1,B001AD54TS,"Sound is atrocious. Even the subtitles didn't help, as so much of the British slang was incorrectly interpreted/misspelled. I never liked Margery Allingham's Peter Wimsey books, and this movie interpretation didn't do the character any favors. In the books, Wimsey seems very pretentious to me; in this movie, he is played as a smart man who pretends to be a moron. Emphasis on the ""moron"" part.  Could have watched it with a smile, if the sound had been improved even a little bit. I spend a small fortune every year with Amazon, and I expect and deserve better quality than this.",1498089600,,581,4.752475247524752
8276761,3,B001AD54TS,Rented on Amazon video...the audio was not very good...hard a hard time following the dialog.,1481328000,,93,5.266666666666667
8276762,5,B001AD54TS,I love the actor who played Peter whimsy . He is exactly as Peter whimsy in the books are! Fun little movie!,1477785600,,108,3.9545454545454546
8276763,5,B001AD54TS,"I am methodically making my way through all of the 1930s and 1940s British mysteries available on Amazon, and this is one of my favorites, if not the best so far. Great plotting and a terrific ending that takes place in a train engine work shed. These were the days of the London and Northeastern Railway (LNER) and the filming of the carriage interiors as well as locomotives and exteriors is an added treat. There is even a runaway shunting engine in the climax!

I have read other places that this film was edited for viewing on CBS TV in the 1940s - I would enjoy seeing the original theatrical release - but until then this shortened version does very well.",1474070400,2,662,4.471074380165289
8276764,1,B001AD54TS,"Terrible audio quality.  Neither my wife nor I could understand a word.  We gave up after a few minutes.  These early pictures are a crap shoot, but it's shameful of Amazon to put something like this up for sale.",1463356800,,212,4.384615384615385
8276765,2,B001AD54TS,Please stop charging rental fees for this movie. It is not well done as the overview says but a badly cut up and shortened to a 54 minute movie. I have mentioned this movie in particular but many of these old movies do not earn the little $1.99 rental fee.,1452297600,2,256,4.14
8276766,5,B001AD54TS,excellent,1449619200,,9,9.0
8276767,4,B001AD54TS,Sound needs to be cleaned up or ad captioning. Really good story. Surprised I have never seen it before. This very well could have been where they invented the great Colombo. It is Colombo to a tee.,1446508800,,198,4.378378378378378
