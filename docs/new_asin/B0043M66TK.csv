8415142,5,B0043M66TK,"I absolutely loved this movie.. What a wealth of information we end up learning as Martin Clunes takes us round the world. I was so impressed by his  own deep love for horses , and the very interesting people he took us to meet, who show us that the horse  has faithfully helped people throughout the centuries, and is always willing to be your very best friend, if you treat him lovingly.. It was great to see Martin as himself , not as a film character. Thank you so much for making this film Martin.",1388448000,6,502,4.273684210526316
