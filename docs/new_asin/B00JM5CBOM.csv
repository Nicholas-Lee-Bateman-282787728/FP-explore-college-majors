6381569,5,B00JM5CBOM,"Scavenger Killers is a horror / comedy type of a movie, I didn't know there was such a thing.
It kept me Scared and at the edge of my seat, I didn't know what to expect next,
but yet I was laughing throughout entire movie, the Comedy was sort of slap-stick and hilarious.
Made by Kenneth Del Vecchio and Dylan Bank, what were these two crazies thinking.
 I LOVED IT and was very entertained!",1402444800,2,391,4.283783783783784
6381570,5,B00JM5CBOM,"This was an exceptional movie. Good writing as well as directing. The actors especially the leading male judge was hysterical. Its a must see movie, gory , yet funny but its an absolute thrill to watch! But  you will love it!!",1402444800,2,226,4.512195121951219
6381571,5,B00JM5CBOM,"The movie opens with an funny tone and stays like that throughout the film. Robert Bogue is ridiculously hilarious with his presentation and performance. Dustin Diamond plays a psychic with tourettes and he is too funny. I watched it with a few friends and we laughed and were entertained the whole way through. Scavenger killers has some of the sickest and most gruesome kills i've ever seen in a movie, definitely worth checking this out!",1402444800,4,440,4.88
6381572,4,B00JM5CBOM,"As a horror film, Scavenger Killers is as fun as it is gory.  The Film depicts a lively, energetic couple, with full-time professional lives, that still find the time to feed their sociopathic fantasies.  As difficult as this is to believe, Robert Bogue and Rachael Robbins manage to create and portray a scenario in which even our most trusted pillars of the community can have such altered concepts of right and wrong, that it leaves us wondering who can be trusted.  Eric Roberts has certainly played bigger and better roles, but he played this one well in the context of his character. Dustin Diamond portrayed a most delightfully adapted psychic, whose Tourette Syndrome augmented the comic relief in a most enjoyable ""A Fish Called Wanda"" way. This film utilizes sexualization and gender exploitation in an exaggerated way, much like All in the Family exaggerated racism to invalidate it. This is not the scariest movie I have ever seen. It is also not the most gory, but it was an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. Oh...and I hope I am not on the list!",1402444800,2,1067,4.725806451612903
6381573,5,B00JM5CBOM,"If you want to see a really well done but sick horror movie, Scavenger Killers is it. Saw it at Hoboken Film Festival which is actually somewhere in NY. Really funny too with Dustin Diamond playing an undercover cop with Tourette's and other undercover cop in wheelchair who can't speak and does crazy sign language. Overall it's crazy violent but interesting all the way through, telling story of lawyers who are serial killers, one of the lawyers being a judge. So a cool change of pace for this type of movie.",1402444800,2,512,4.637362637362638
6381574,5,B00JM5CBOM,"I love horror films and this was a great one that had all the necessary elements -- psychos, blood, hot chick's, and a good plot.  Main detective steals performance. Won't spoil, but film has some really funny (and gruesome,  and sexy) moments. Not for the feint of heart, but I think this will go down as a cult classic.",1402444800,3,321,4.423728813559322
6381575,5,B00JM5CBOM,"I watch dozens of horror movies every month, and the first time I watched this it instantly jumped into my short list of favorite films ever.

Everything from the great ensemble cast to the story, characters, humor, gore and effects are TOP NOTCH.  You can tell while watching it that the entire cast and crew truly had a passion for what they were making and had fun making it, which is hard to say about most films.

Robert Bogue especially shines as Judge Limone, relishing his character's psychotic evil in a performance that rivals Christian Bale in American Psycho, in my humble opinion.  Rachael Robbins (who also co-wrote the script), as the Bonnie to his Clyde, feeds off his twistedness and amplifies it right back at him in some sort of feedback loop of craziness.  Eric Roberts charms the screen with the usual Eric-Roberts-ness while Dustin Diamond plays his character's counterpart -- A Tourette's Syndrome-inflicted clairvoyant who, in order to activate his sixth sense, must grope a heavyset black woman while inserting his fingers in her mouth (No, I'm not making any of this up).  If my childhood memories of Screech as the sweet, awkward nerd from 'Saved by the Bell' weren't already destroyed they sure are now.

The fact that it's receiving such polarized reviews and being met by some with disgust only attests to Scavenger Killers' greatness that will stand the test of time.  If you're an overly sensitive, easily offended, weak stomached person with a fear of having your sensibilities challenged stay away -- But if you're like me and enjoy a well made, fun, unique, over the top film this is the one you've been waiting for a long, long time.",1402444800,4,1669,4.831578947368421
6381576,1,B00JM5CBOM,"This movie insults me both as a filmmaker and as a woman. The way that they sexualized such graphic gore is unnecessary and unhealthy. The plot wasn't even good. I didn't care about any of the characters. The dialogue was purely exposition while the director indulged in making violent porn. It's not worth watching, never mind buying.",1402358400,5,335,4.894736842105263

6381578,4,B00JM5CBOM,"I had no idea what to expect in this gruesomely, insanely funny, Troma or even H G Lewis type blood and gore film.  I've been reviewing all kinds of gore films, which the good ones, I called Gorefest Delights, since I used to publish an underground fanzine ""The Gorefest"" for several years, so this one is definitely a gorefest delight.  the team of serial killers, I found to be very entertaining, and the the gore effects are top notch, from start to finish in this very entertaining blood and gore, and sadistic film, but with a big tongue in cheek plot which delivers in every respect.  I loved it, it made me laugh, and even shocked me in some of the gore and kills.  If you like gore films, you should love this one, it reminds me of the many such films that came out in the late 80's, although there is nothing serious about this one, as it is just flat out fun, but not for the squeamish or movie fans that don't get this type of movie.  and another big element in this one, is non-stop sex and naked women, which always adds another factor for us gorehounds to enjoy.",1412899200,,1076,4.306930693069307

6381581,3,B00JM5CBOM,"A judge (Robert Bogue) and a lawyer (Rachael Robbins) go on an erotic killing spree in a manner of a Lloyd Kaufman Troma film. The FBI has a colorful cast of misfits on the trail. These include a psychic agent (Dustin Diamond) who gets his readings by groping an obese woman (Thea Vidale). Agent Truman (Ken Del Vecchio also script writer) is a mute in a wheelchair.

The film had all the makings to be a cult classic, yet seemed to fall short. The production was uneven. I liked the sign interpretation scenes, shades of a Nelson Mandela memorial, but for the most part, Robert Bogue couldn't deliver his lines to provide an entertaining film. I did like the classical music playing during the signature killing scene, shades of ""Clockwork Orange"" but they only did it once. Rachael Robbins co-work this work and managed to keep her clothes on except for showing her butt.

Film is good enough to get your Troma fix, but not the cult classic it tries too hard to be.

6381582,1,B00JM5CBOM,This movie was just terrible. Expecting a bad movie and was still amazed at how terrible it was. Eric Roberts was in it for maybe 5 minutes. Avoid this one like the plague unless you just want to torture yourself.,1406419200,4,213,4.35
6381583,1,B00JM5CBOM,"It's amazing how difficult it is to describe what could possibly be one of the worst films I've ever had to sit through as this one. SCAVENGER KILLERS features some of the worst acting, the worst effects and the worst plotline of I've ever had to endure. From the opening moments of this film till the end credits rolled I was dumbfounded once again that this movie was actually given the green light, the money was provided for someone to make this film while others sat on the shelf.

The story is thin here. A judge and a defense attorney set out to kill as many people in as many ways as they can. The first victim is one that the judge rules in favor of even if the circumstantial evidence was enough to go for a conviction. Not only do the judge and the lady attorney kill this victim the sequence they've done so has her in bed with them and their bodies covered in her blood. I'm sure that the reason behind this was to shock but instead it just somehow gives them a chance to display their acting abilities instead. In other words they can't act.

The pair continues to kill and kill again, which of course means we get the chance for some gratuitous flesh from time to time. In particular we get to see three victims for the price of one, of course all female, standing on boxes with their hands tied up above. One is decapitated in what appears to be one of the most terrible special effects moments captured on film combining actual effects with CGI for a terrible effect. And during the moments of their kills it seems the judge and attorney feel compelled to have sex as well.

With all of that you would think this was the worst offense committed here but it isn't. What is is the fact that well known and respected actors actually appear in this film. Eric Roberts, Charles Durning and Robert Loggia all make appearances in the film and all I cold think each time they appeared on screen was are they really in need of money so badly that they'd appear in something like this? It saddened me to think they had to be in something so terrible.

While I watched I tried to force myself to believe that what was going on here was a campy film made to look like those of H.G. Lewis, a homage perhaps to poorly made, poorly shot films that fell into a category of movies that were so bad they were good. If that was the attempt they failed miserably.

I'm hoping I never have to see either of the leads in this film again in a movie or if so that they take a few acting classes before then. If they've already done so then they need to ask for their money back. Each time I saw the lead actress in this film I kept thinking she must be a porn star because not only does she look like one offering a display of cleavage every chance she had but she had the same acting talents of one as well.

To list the things wrong with this movie would be to waste consonants and vowels. Suffice to say that this is a bad movie and not in a good way. I am stunned to find a number of favorable reviews online for this movie. It makes me think either those posting those reviews either work for or are related to someone involved with the film. That or they're written by people who adore any and all horror films that offer gore more than story. I honestly can't think of a single word that has been created to say how bad this movie is. So let's just stick with two: it stinks.",1405382400,5,3375,4.224806201550388

6381585,5,B00JM5CBOM,"Everyone who was disgusted by this film needs to lighten up. It doesn't pretend to be high art or make any political statement. It's just a fun, gory serial killer flick with great actors turning in intentionally kitschy performances. I enjoyed it thoroughly and I suspect that if you're in to this type of movie, you will too!",1404604800,3,327,4.655172413793103
6381586,4,B00JM5CBOM,"Heres a trivia question for you:  what do you get when you combine the surrealism of TWIN PEAKS with the hardcore bloodshed and ruthlessness of NATURAL BORN KILLERS?  The answer is SCAVENGER KILLERS, a film that is due out tomorrow, just in time for the Fourth of July.  If you're a fan of either title I mentioned above, I will wager this film will be next on your list of Must See Movies.  And it should beits a crazy, twisted fun-ride of mayhem and massacres!

The title of this film threw me at first; it doesnt make sense if you take it at face value.  But once the film gets going, the title (and concept) are quickly evident.  Im not giving anything major away by telling you it refers to a killing scavenger hunt, which the two main characters embark upon.  They draw victims out of a bag and then have to kill whoever or whatever is on the piece of paper they draw.

SCAVENGER KILLERS is shot well and looks pretty good onscreen, although you can tell by some of the set locations that is a lower-budget film.  I refer specifically to the FBI offices, which are located in an old, red-brick building.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it stuck out to me for some reason.

The acting is good, too, with the talented Robert Bogue and lovely Rachael Robbins headlining as the titular characters.  Both play psychos with a chilling expertise, and their onscreen chemistry is very believable.  Screen legends Charles Durning and Robert Loggia even have cameos, which gives the film even more credibility.

The gore in SCAVENGER KILLERS is outstanding.  There are many practical effects shots, which is a huge plus for me.  A few of these shots are rounded out with some CG, but its hard to tell when they occur.  As a result, this blood-soaked romp satisfies on many levels.

My sole complaint about the film is that theres really not much of a plot to speak of.  The pair bicker while they kill and then make-up with some heavy lovin.  The FBI is trying to figure out who the killers are (by using a Tourettes Syndrome-laced psychic who has to fondle the breasts of a black woman for his visions), but otherwise theres not much going on.

Honestly, though, thats part of what makes this film so much fun.  Its just senseless violence infused with a bizarre cast of characters.  This is a heck of a film, and its one every horror fan should watch for sure.  Its quirky and at times brutal, which makes this a must-see film.  Give it a look if you can handle it, but be warned:  you're in for a hell of a ride.",1404172800,3,2520,4.445414847161572

The ensemble cast was magnificent, it was actually really funny, the effects and direction were top notch, and the story was pretty enjoyable. The gore was there, but the comedy kept it entertaining. I could sit here and go on and on about Robert Loggia's performance and Dylan Banks directing, but I can't do it justice. A must watch.",1402617600,2,525,4.645161290322581

Why would three big name actors want to appear in this? I mean this a a very low budget B to C  film. It's kind of a cross of a Troma  style film meets Saw. Anyway it was watchable, and moved fast.

8652396,4,B00JM5CBOM,"""Scavenger Killers"" is a creative, modern spin on the serial killer lovers concept, although they are more Mickey & Malory than Bonnie & Clyde but either criminal duo applies with these two characters, Taylor and Sarah. The prose has Kenneth Del Vecchio and Rachael Robbins coming off like the super-hetero-bastard-children, of some twisted love affair between Quentin Tarantino and John Waters. The cast, and it is a recognizable and eclectic one, give pretty convincing -all be it over- the-top performances that really sell this story. I mean considering the subject matter and vision that Bank shoots for in ""Scavenger Killers"" it is noteworthy that everyone delivers reasonably believable characters. The film is dark, satirical and gory.

The special effects used in ""Scavenger Killers"" is a standard assemblage off practical (small amount of CGI) effects that is necessary for this sort of film. Trust when I say that this is a visceral, all out, gory film filled with plenty of kill scenes and blood splatter. Considering the budget and the lack of fear to put the effects in your face, it is commendable the amount of care Bank and his team put in to giving us the gruesome. Some of the sequences are obvious and don't quite reach the ""reality"" mark, but the quality of the effects in ""Scavenger Kills"" is equal to that of most blood soaked horror effects of films with a much higher budget. My only turn off was the little bit of CGI that was used for blood splatter and kill effect. Most scenes embraced straight-up, practical effects, and since the CGI was very minimal it doesn't hurt the film or the kill sequences that featured them.

Overall ""Scavenger Kills"" creates a wicked, modern spin on the Bonnie & Clyde concept with total homicidal depravity. The style is a Sado- sexually charged, exploitation blend of torture-porn and serial killer celebration which normally is not my favorite subgenre in horror, but the over-exaggerated, insane characters and dark humor make everything fun, and entertaining. ""Scavenger Killers"" is not like other films in this category. The film will offend some, irritate others but for those special, slightly disturbed few, this film will be pure, unadulterated fun. Which ever column you fit with your reaction to seeing ""Scavenger Killers"" , the film is definitely an instant cult classic.",1432080000,3,2343,5.051679586563307
