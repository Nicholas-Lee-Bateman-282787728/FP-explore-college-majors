7599227,5,B01AEOM65S,"Another winner by Ken Burns.  Provided information of his life growing up, his love for baseball, what he and his wife went through when Jackie became the first black man to play in the major leagues, and his life after he retired from the game.  Jackie became a tireless spokesman for the black man's right to fair and equal treatment.  This is a great documentary that everyone should see, highly recommend.",1464048000,,409,4.732394366197183

8747175,5,B01AEOM65S,"This is a comprehensive and complete documentary about a remarkable athlete who changed our country forever. It shows that Jackie Robinson was proud of who he is and was proud of his blackness (his word). I found the film interesting and educational. It shows what a remarkable person Jackie Robinson is, not only as a famous athlete but as a hero. I enjoyed the interviews with his family, especially his wife. I was also surprised to see President Obama in the film briefly making a statement about Jackie Robinson. There is also rarely seen photographs and film footage. It is a little long and may not keep younger children's interest but I highly recommend it for families. You should know that it is rather long. There are also special features which include The Anderson Monarchs, Outtakes, Lifelong Hero, Ready to Play, In the thick of it and a Conversation with the filmmakers. I found the Anderson Monarchs the most interesting which is based on an all African American inner city little league team. Highly inspirational and I highly recommend! 5 out of 5 stars for ages 9 to 18. Reviewed by Denise B. KIDS FIRST! Juror",1465171200,,1130,4.770408163265306
