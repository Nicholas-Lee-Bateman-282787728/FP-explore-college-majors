8061679,5,B0009IWFVU,"These two parks are right next door to each other and it makes sense to feature them on one DVD.
This is yet another quality offering from Finley-Holiday and is bound to give the viewer ""itchy feet"".

The Grand Teton National Park feature runs for 30 minutes and gives the viewer a really good look at the park mostly from the eastern side of the Teton Range. There are a few scenes taken on some of the trails ie. entrance to Cascade Canyon and Garnett Canyon but the views are mostly of the mountains from the eastern lowlands of the Jackson Hole section of the park.
The photography is lovely and inspirational and is accompanied with excellent narration and background music. Several park rangers are briefly interviewed and they talk about interesting facets of the park. There are some nice views from a rafting trip down the Snake River too.

The ""Complete Yellowstone"" feature runs for about 42 minutes and is basically an abridged version of the DVD / Blu-ray that is dedicated to Yellowstone Park, also called ""The Complete Yellowstone"". The main feature of this more complete DVD runs for 62 minutes.
The feature here is thoroughly enjoyable and is more than enough to give the viewer an excellent insight to the park's wildlife, scenery, brief history and attractions.

This DVD is simply beautiful and I find it easy to put on again and again without tiring of it. I recommend it to all lovers of national parks, nature and quality photography.",1345334400,6,1457,4.75098814229249
8061680,5,B0009IWFVU,"Many people may just see Grand Teton as a drive-by on the way to Yellowstone. Or, if they stop at all, it's just to look at the Tetons themselves and that's it.

There's much more to do here -- see elk and moose, pelicans, swans and other waterfowl, hike to or around one of several lakes, or hike backcountry. This video looks at more of the possibilities.

Just about any Finley-Holiday video will be worth your money. High-quality shooting, good cinematography, informative voice-overs and very fitting musical scoring all add up to make a great series.

Plus, videos in the Finley-Holiday series normally have bonus features, such as sidebar attractions in the area. And, they film in all seasons of the year, something you and I can't do on a single trip.

In other words, if you haven't gone to a particular park yet, Finley-Holiday will be the final thing to get you going. If you have, it's a great souvenir without having to lug a camcorder around yourself.",1136160000,7,966,4.6982248520710055
