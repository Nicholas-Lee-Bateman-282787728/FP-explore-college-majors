The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.
