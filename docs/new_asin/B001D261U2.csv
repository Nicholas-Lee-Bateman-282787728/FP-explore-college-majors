This workout has her trademark excellent cuing and charismatic energy but it's very easy, both in terms of choreography and cardio intensity. I didn't really sweat doing it and I'm only in average shape. She also uses the TIFT style of cuing that is a little out of vogue these days. With moves this simple, I don't want to keep repeating them. I gave this three stars because this would be an excellent choice for someone just starting out or recovering from an injury. The workout itself is filmed professionally in a well-lit indoor location (unlike many Gaiam DVD's that are outdoors) and the entire cast seems to be having a good time without appearing cheesy.

For others, the best Patricia Moreno workout I've encountered thus far has been IntenSati.",1304812800,,837,4.8125

This also contains two ""cardio club jam"" dance workouts. They are short, constant moving as she teaches workouts w/Patricia alone.
Dance funk - 12 min mix of very simple or part of popular dance moves: shoulder shakes, bumps, mambo, v-step, couple part of '50's dances, broadway, chasse, leg slide, etc.
Cardio salsa jam - 9 min w/different latin moves, this set has more polished & cool moves like heel step w/triple step in between, stepping on toes w/hip circle, side step w/1/2 figure 8, etc. I liked this set.
You get a choice of 2 different dance tracks for each of the 3 portions. There is no other setting choices.

She still has a very friendly, encouraging, positive personality, but still comes off a bit boring or stiff, maybe because she worries about teaching so much which she does do well. She obviously has had dance training & is flexible, but still moves a little stiff & carefully. This is best for beginners in terms for impact/endurance, but for the 2 short routines, most should be able to follow, though I can't promise for those w/2 left feet who don't have past dance dvd or class experience.
