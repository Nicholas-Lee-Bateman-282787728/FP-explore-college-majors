There are extremely few boxers I get caught up with to the point that I feel for them. Ol' Ricky is one of them. I spent 40 bucks ordering from an online boxing collector every fight available that Hatton fought in his pros, but the quality failed in comparison to this video. Even though I own every fight he has had, I still prefer to watch this DVD because the quality is so crisp, you can feel the punches, you can take every punch Hatton takes, and you can share the excitement that the thousands of faithful British fans have shared over the years. I always say that besides Julio Cesar Chavez, Ricky Hatton is one of, if not the second best junior welterweight ever. You could argue that perhaps Aaron Pryor was better, or whoever, but personally as a boxing fan, I feel that Hatton is better. It's just how I see things.

Regardless of what kind of fan of boxing you are, if you want to see high flying punches and some serious knockouts, watch this video! I got it in America but I think it's only supposed to work in the UK... when i put it into my laptop or my PS3 it says ""Video in the PAL broadcast standard is not supported."" While this thing does say that the region works everywhere, that's not what happened here...I had to get a PAL DVD drive just to watch it...oh well..

Regardless of my thinking that JCC was the best light welterweight in history, Ricky is my most favorite fighter in history. I literally cried the Pacquiao and Mayweather nights. Ricky, if you read this, I'll always be your fan, mate!

Great quality DVD in visual, sound, menus, etc. Just need PAL.

5/5
