Synopsis: twenty something Kaju leaves the comfortable confines of America and returns to her native India to rediscover her birth heritage. In the process of the usual site seeing and other exotic tourist distractions she finds herself drawn repeatedly back to a slum area in Deli. She experiences an indescribable affinity for the place and begins to have what appear to be flashbacks of a childhood she had long since forgotten.

Eventually a series of personal revelations begin to unfold to Kaju which center around this run down habitat and a tragic event from the past, the riots of '84 where 5 to 10 thousand Sikhs lost their lives. In her search to understand her Indian roots she finds much more than the secret of her own personal past. She discovers a past that India would sooner leave unexamined.

Critique: `Amu' exemplifies what independent filmmaking should be all about: solid storytelling, likeable cast and biting social commentary that succeeds without the necessity of well known actors, or big budget production values. Konkona Sensharma is wonderfully appealing as Kaju exuding just the right amount of strength and vulnerability needed to effectively portray role of a young ex-patriot returning to a homeland she doesn't remember but desires to embrace. I look forward to seeing more of her on film in the future.

I also found the rest of the cast to also be quite good, particularly Kaju's love interest Kabir and her Mother who surprises her daughter by showing up in India just as she begins to put some of the puzzle pieces of her past together. However the most important aspect of this film is its main theme, the '84 riots. If all you take from watching this film is the knowledge of this monumental horrific genocide than that is enough.",1284076800,,1834,4.906451612903226

8290645,5,B001D08H5Q,"Shonali Bose's ""Amu"" is based on her novel of the same name and tells the story of Kaju, an American of Indian origin who goes back to Delhi, India to visit her relatives and unearth the secret of her past. Kaju [Konkona Sen Sharma] is an adopted child, and has always been interested to know more about her birth parents, but her adoptive mother refuses to divulge any details, leaving the young woman frustrated and yearning to uncover her past.

She meets a new friend, Kabir [Ankur Khanna] a young man who also happens to be the only son of a wealthy and influential politician. Together they visit the slums of Delhi, making friends amongst the slum dwellers. Kaju's recollection of the slum in the past convinces her that her past must be tied to the slums, and she does some detective work on her own, uncovering a horrific secret about her past in the process, which is also tied to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in New Delhi which claimed the lives of approximately 5,000 Sikhs.

Though the 1984 anti-Sikh riots provides the backdrop for the movie's narration, the actual focus itself is not so much on the riots itself, but on Kaju's journey of discovery about her origins and her past. Konkona Sen Sharma does a credible and commendable job in her portrayal of the confused and frustrated Kaju who can't seem to understand why her adoptive mother chooses to remain silent about Kaju's past. Ankur Khanna as Kabir is not very convincing in his role, and seems rather ineffectual here.

The actual riots themselves are not delved into too deeply except for mentioning the most rudimentary facts, but there are some disturbing flashback scenes to the riots such as the portrayal of mobs rampaging on the trains, and in the slums, though the bloodshed is rather muted here. As a background info - the 1984 anti-Sikh riots was precipitated by the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards. The assassination itself was prompted by the PM's command to the military to storm the Golden Temple in Amritsar [the holy shrine of the Sikhs] in order to capture some Sikh militants. The assassination fanned anti-Sikh sentiment and led to mass killings of Sikhs, especially in Delhi. There is some controversy about this issue - there are reports of the Indian government's complicity in the riots, in that some politicians actively encouraged anti-Sikh acts and that the police did not do much to stamp out the violence. Till today, the Sikh community in India is still seeking redress for the riots.

The movie itself is in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi with the option of English subtitles. The total running time is 102 minutes. I would recommend this to those who like human dramas with substance.",1240358400,8,2732,4.806382978723405
