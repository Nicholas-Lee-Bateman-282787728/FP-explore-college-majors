8448240,5,B004YESLH2,"Uwe Scholz's marrying of Mozart's Great Mass in C minor with a full length ballet is a spiritual and artistic tour de force, one for the ages! This is a production where everything seems to gel perfectly, the choreography, the dancers, the orchestra and choir, the vocal soloists, the stage and lighting, and given the stunning video and audio recording, this may arguably be the most  outstanding ballet disc of the year.
It opens with a block of dancers, the women sheathed in white and the men in white with bared torsos, kneeling and then in ones and twos slowly rising to the sound of a Gregorian chant (the introitus from the Mass of the feast of St Thomas ). Riveting. Then follows choreographed set pieces to the Kyrie and Gloria of Mozart's Great Mass,all beautifully danced, some quiet and reverential some bursting with spirt and dynamism. The choir of the Leipzig Opera sing wonderfully, but for me the soprano soloist  Eunyee You makes the greatest impact....her shimmering voice rising to the the high heavens sends a tingle down my spine.
I thought when it came to the Credo that this has to be the tops but along came the Sanctus and Osanna and wow , one is lost for words! Among the quieter passages Mozart's adagio and fugue in C minor stand out and the ethereal Ave Verum Corpus was simply sublime. Put simply this is a work that will send your spirits into orbit. What a glorious way to celebrate the Great Mass.  Awesome !",1382140800,,1443,4.607003891050583
