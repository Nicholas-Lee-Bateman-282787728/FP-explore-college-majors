8165824,2,B000M2DMWE,This was very disappointing. Forced laughter and lame bits far short of what made Soupy's early shows so much fun.,1370390400,3,114,4.75
8165825,4,B000M2DMWE,"For those who are too young to know, Soupy Sales had a some TV shows in the late 50's and early 60's from Detroit and later Los Angeles. He was also a regular panelist on the game show ""What's My Line?"" as well as other game shows of the era. However he is probably best known for his NY show from 1964-1966 which ran for 260 episodes. The show was brought back in 1978 from Los Angeles and ran for 65 episodes and was known as ""The New Soupy Sales Show"". He also has probably taken more pies in the face than any other person ever has or will. While billed as a children's show adults enjoyed it for it's slapstick humor and adult references without being dirty enough for most children to get. I was able to enjoy most of those NY shows on TV when I was young but as an adult now see a lot he was able to get away with that was adult in nature. This collection I believe is mostly from the 1978 ""New Soupy Sales Show"" but is two hours of fun if you enjoy his type of humor. You can easily tell that Soupy and the crew of the show were having fun.",1366934400,4,1048,3.971563981042654
