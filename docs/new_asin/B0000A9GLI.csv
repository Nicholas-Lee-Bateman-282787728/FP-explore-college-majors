7996407,3,B0000A9GLI,"I never considered The Gatlin Brothers  a group.  To me it was always Larry Gatlin.  I saw them live once myself and he came out by himself and did some songs. Then they came out and they did some stuff together.  I thought that he was going to be bigger.  And when they came out with All The Gold In California I thought that was when they were going to break out. They had a string of hits.  But never really became a top act like say Kenny Rogers.  And I think the main reason was Larry himself who seemed to me a little stand offish.  And I don't think they should have came out with the song Mogen David as a single.  A lot of radio stations wouldn't play it and that set them back.
This dvd i not bad.  They do have good tight harmonies.  And they do some good early songs like Night Time Magic.  And Larry could always hit those high notes. And of course there is All The Gold In California.  This was recoded in Nashville.  But it seems like it is more of  a Branson type show.",1505088000,,985,4.0310880829015545
