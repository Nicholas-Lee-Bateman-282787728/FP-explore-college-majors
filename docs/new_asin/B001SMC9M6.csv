3786012,2,B001SMC9M6,"As a background, I am a parent who speaks no Japanese.  My 3.5 year old son is a quarter Japanese, and I really want to teach him about Japanese language and culture since it is part of his heritage.  We got these as a gift and I really wanted to like them, but my son has had no interest.  I have tried several times over the past couple of years.  Truthfully, I had trouble following it.  I will caveat my review by saying that my son isn't really big on TV/cartoons - he is one of those kids that is always on the move so I don't think this is a method of learning that works for him.  So it is possible that these might work better for little kids who can sit still a bit better and like to watch cartoons more.  It probably would help if one or both parents was able to speak some Japanese as well and help guide their child a bit with it.  As for us, I think I am going to talk to my son's grandma about teaching him Japanese since she is fluent.",1403827200,,952,3.9476439790575917
3786013,2,B001SMC9M6,"A little too baby-ish for the stated audience. My kids quickly lost interest. For the stated audience, there needs to be more interaction.",1385078400,,138,5.043478260869565
3786014,4,B001SMC9M6,I only give it a 4 star because the hebrew words are transliterated and I wish they would put actual hebrew. My son likes the dvd's and I'm learing a few things as well!,1358726400,,169,4.0
3786015,5,B001SMC9M6,"My daughter is fairly advanced in her verbal skills for a 2 year old and she has thoroughly enjoyed and learned lots from these videos.  She requests the Panda and we know what she wants to see!  The animation is very charming and she is very engaged when watching. Since we watch with her and stop to repeat and talk about the words being taught, we are learning, too!",1344556800,2,369,4.333333333333333
3786016,4,B001SMC9M6,"I wasn't sure how much success I would have with these DVDs. Whenever I try to read to my son (age 3) in Japanese, he gets bored and walks away, and when I try to show him Japanese movies, he always demands that I ""play it in English!"" However, he loves these. He repeats after Pim, gets very excited, and has started to tell me things like, ""Inu means dog!"" which I love.

My only criticisms are
1) The DVDs mix expressions with vocabulary, and if you do not speak Japanese, it can be confusing to which action the expression refers. You can put the DVD on subtitles, but to me this serves no purpose - my son does not yet read, and he is relying on the DVD to teach him. He will not learn anything from the subtitles, so they work more as a parental guide for those parents who do not speak Japanese. This only happens once or twice, however, in general the examples are clear.
2) The DVDs provide the Romanization of the Japanese words, but do not write the words in kana. This strikes me as a missed opportunity. My son is watching the DVD to learn, and so having the words appear in hiragana or kanji would be a nice additional lesson.

Overall, though, I am very pleased. My son frequently requests ""Panda!"" and is so enthusiastic while watching that I have to highly recommend these.",1331510400,3,1290,4.3264462809917354
3786017,5,B001SMC9M6,"My 3 1/2 year old enjoys watching these dvd's and pays close attention when they're playing.  Not sure if they're actually going to teach him any Hebrew, but at the very least they provide a little variety and education to his tv watching time.",1295481600,,244,4.545454545454546
3786018,5,B001SMC9M6,"My son and I really enjoy these videos together.  Although, he's only 6 months old they seem to hold his attention pretty well, as they do mine.  I have learned many things already and my husband, who is Japanese, is pretty impressed with what I have learned so far.  The option to have subtitles in English is excellent, otherwise I would miss the meaning of a few things here and there.  Otherwise, most things are obvious when relating them to the what's going on in the video.  I also like that you see the written Japanese words (in Roman letters), so that you can understand the full pronunciation.  I find it's easier to learn another language like a child would because they teach most of the basic necessities in the language.  I definitely recommend these videos and am considering getting them in Spanish for my son and for my husband too.",1277424000,3,850,4.589403973509934
3786019,4,B001SMC9M6,"My son goes to a bilingual immersion Montessori preschool.  They speak both Japanese and Mandarin in the class.  Since there was no one at home who could reinforce his Japanese, we bought little Pim to supplement.  it is now one of his favorite DVDs and he repeats the words.  He just turn 2.
Pros:
The panda seems to catch his attention.
Easy words to pick up.  Words are repeated throughout.

Cons:
Would be nice if spelled out some of the other words and not just the object they are focused on.
My sons sings some Japanese children songs he learns from school and that's what is missing from this.  No singing.

Other than that, its a great DVD.",1276214400,8,649,4.440677966101695
3786020,4,B001SMC9M6,My 2 1/2 year old can watch this all day but my 5 year old gets bored with it quickly. I was hoping this would help supplement her Japanese school. I figured I would put it away for awhile and try it again after she gets over the newness of all of her Christmas video game toys.,1264809600,8,278,3.8947368421052633

8339998,4,B001SMC9M6,"We are raising our sons to be bilingual with English/Japanese and we have found these DVDs are a solid tool in early language learning. Our 2 year old loves watching them and loves having the Little Pim doll as well.

Some Cons: Much like Rosetta Stone, this program takes the same video/images and just adds a new language track on top. In doing so, you miss out on cultural context, etc. And since Japan is all about context, this is a fault to make it one size fits all. Also, I really wish Little Pim: Japanese was available in more volumes like the other languages. Japanese seems to have been short changed by the company.",1492473600,,628,4.460869565217391

8340000,5,B001SMC9M6,"My son absolutely adores Little Pim. I bought the Japanese set and I'm very excited to say that me and my son have learned quite a bit from this video. Actually, he asked to watch it so much I also bought a Spanish set to change it up a bit. Hands down an amazing way to learn a foreign language both for children and adults.",1456617600,,325,4.015384615384615

8340005,4,B001SMC9M6,"Bought this for a 3.5 year-old. He really likes it, especially the animated Little Pim character. Only four stars, because this appears to be a single video that they localize for each language. For Japanese, it was surprising to have forks and spoons and spaghetti instead of their far more common Japanese equivalent. It may be that the market doesn't exist for separate productions, but I would have loved if more culturally specific terms were included. Still, a solid product that helped my son transition to Japanese living.",1410652800,,530,5.034090909090909
8340006,1,B001SMC9M6,"As a former resident of Kyoto and translator of Japanese on both coasts - I'm self taught - no one realizes that the Japanese DO NOT want you or your child to learn Japanese. Hence the romaji, the lack of songs, etc. Best thing is to go to the Japanese book store in NY or LA - Kinokuniya - and go downstairs to the all-Japanese sections for kids. If you can get past the looks (like you're not supposed to be there) you're halfway to making your child, or yourself, bilingual.",1406851200,,477,4.252747252747253
