8460537,5,B0057FGD3G,It has many valuable stories of moral character and doing what it right rather than what makes you feel good.,1383782400,,109,4.5
8460538,4,B0057FGD3G,"There is a classic feel to the animation along with well thought out storylines and character development. Entertaining with a message. Through vignettes that take a look at life through the vantage point of an elephant family, it explore and resolves human issues. Wholesome, simple and educational. Stories teach important lessons, such as dealing with peer pressure. Each episode focuses on one common problem, being new to a school and bullies, problem-solving, sibling rivalry and peer pressure. Teaches positive ways to handle each situation.

Here's what our youth critics had to say: ""I like the elephant, it was funny."" It engages the kids and they laughed at the elephants. The old-fashioned style of it was fun to watch, but didn't make them ask to see it again. The kids really like the baby elephants and talked about how they should better treat one another.",1332115200,,872,5.055555555555555
8460539,5,B0057FGD3G,"This is the classic Babar character, who is more regal (and much more enjoyable) than the most recent television version. If you grew up with Babar, these stories warm the heart and harken back to simpler times.  Babar the elephant still wears a crown, travels by train, and brings his diplomatic style to the screen even as he confronts his nemesis Lord Rataxes.",1313452800,3,363,4.761904761904762
