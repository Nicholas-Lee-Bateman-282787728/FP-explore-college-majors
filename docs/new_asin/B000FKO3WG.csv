2570846,4,B000FKO3WG,"These two movies are excellent. The action is non-stop and Jason Statham is perfect for the role. If I have any complaints, it is the Audi's he drives. Having had an Audi A3 3.2 S series and seeing what a guy rolling back into me did to it, crushed front bumper and busted radiator, I doubt Statham's Audi could do all the stunts without some major dents and dings, but we don't see any. Hope they didn't have to wait nine weeks for parts like I did. Anyway these movies are great when you want to pop in some heavy popcorn eating fun. The storylines are a little stretched at times, but it is after all an actioner that wasn't meant to be overly realistic. The martial art stunt scenes will make you think of Jet Li or Jackie Chan and the car chases will put ""Bullitt"" to the test. I highly recommend this set for most the family. The language and some scenes are a little rough for pre-teens. Good quality DVD and excellent replayabilty.",1203897600,,939,4.340909090909091

2570853,5,B000FKO3WG,"In The Transporter 1 + 2 the stunts are out of this world.  Just remember it is an ACTION MOVIE... it takes fight scenes, firepower and character beyond the real world.  Jason Statham is a great actor and he is also a highly skilled martial artist.  You will also enjoy the adorable Taiwanese actress/model, Shu Qi.  This movie is a must have for any action movie fan and a real man's movie.  VERY ENTERTAINING!",1168473600,5,411,4.5

2570855,5,B000FKO3WG,"To be honest, my expectations were not that high when I first saw ""The Transporter.""  Both movies, however, in this set are great.  There is a lot of action with some excellent stunt work by Jason Statham.  The fight scenes are intricately choreographed.  What elevates this over many similar movies is the detail to writing.  There is much humor sprinkled through out both.  This set of films also avoid the problem that many of this genre have in that the story merely repeats itself in the sequel.  That does not happen here.  Both are well produced and fun to see.  Break the third rule and look in the package.",1154563200,24,615,4.568807339449541

This is for ""The Transporter Collection"", the box of which has a bar along the top that says ""Includes Both Explosive Feature Films!"" and a photo of Statham leaping through the air with two guns drawn and aimed, and the bottoms of his shoes visible.

Inside this box are both movies, each in their own retail plastic case, just as if you would have bought them each at any store. You could theoretically just toss the outer cardboard sleeve if you want. I'm keeping mine, but it's not necessary except as something to keep the two retail versions together.

""The Transporter"" is the ""Special Delivery Edition"", same as the retail version. Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1 Region 1 NTSC Full-length Audio Commentary by Actor Jason Statham and Producer Steven Chasman, 15 minutes of Unrated Extended Fight Sequences Not Shown In Theaters with optional commentary by Statham, Chasman, and Director Cory Yuen, Behind-The-Scenes Documentary, Storyboard-to-Film comparison, A look At Making Transporter 2.

""Transporter 2"" Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1. Otherwise, no special features.

I didn't include a review of the actual movies, since others here have done that better than I could. This was intended merely to help others like me, who may have been confused by the lack of information. If I've missed anything, please let me know in the comment section, and I'll try to address it, or someone else can.",1212796800,215,1601,5.026415094339622
2570984,3,B000FKO3WG,"I absolutely loved Transporter, and was pleasantly surprised when Transporter 2 turned out to be an even better movie.

But the current asking price for the package is more than the current asking price for the two individual DVDs combined.

What justifies this?  Is there some value added?  Are there more entertaining ""special features"" in the boxed set?  We'll never know, because Amazon doesn't have anything to say about the set.  It's just dropped on us  like bovine excrement on a flat rock.  Which usually speaks for itself.

Back to the Transporter series and Jason Statham:
Statham was excellent in this two-movie series, and the character was extremely appealing.  One wonders why they don't milk this for at least one more film, since it has built-in box office appeal.

However, someone has spent a TON of money bankrolling vehicles for Statham.  He's a so-so action star, his appeal as ""good guy"" exceeds his ability to play a ""not so good guy"": his character in ""Crank"" was so desultory that that we didn't care whether he lived or died.  (Good thing: he died.)  He was okay in ""WAR"", but Jet Li carried him ... Li was the star, Statham was the supporting actor; his character had no fire.

Heck in, ""In The Name Of The King"", Statham was unconvincing and supported by washed-up aging actors Burt Reynolds and John Rhys Davies.  Burt was wooden, Rhys Davies was an example of how awful it is when the Botox wears off, and Statham with his salon-maintained trademark two-day-old beard was, at best, an anachronistic Farmer.  And that is one of the best movies of the many he has starred in for the past 3 years (with the possible exception of ""The Bank Job"", which is so exceptionally good that it actually enjoyed a feature-run in the theaters rather than going directly to DVD.)

If his career continues to be so mis-managed, Statham is likely to end up like Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme.  YOu know them; the make a movie with their buddys every year or two, it goes directly to DVD, and they make enough from Hollywood Video rentals to make house payments and an annual trip to the Bahamas.  They just don't care anymore, because they've had a couple of blockbusters and it's all just a paycheck any more.

(John Wayne did the same thing, but that was before ""go directly to DVD"".  And he's dead: a very effective marketing device which is probably not attractive to Statham.)

So my question is, if someone is willing to back Statham's career to the point of producing some very expensive movies, why can't they spend a few more bucks to get good writers and good directors and good editors?  The production values (with the exception of the editing) are excellent in all of the films, but the movies produced seem to be without oversight.

Just a few changes in the scripts and editing would have resulted in GOOD movies rather than just ACCEPTABLE movies.  Are the directors unwilling to put in the cutting room overtime needed to make a so-so movie better?

Unfortunately, if Statham makes another movie as good as the Transporter duo, it will probably be badly marketed.  Again.

Too bad.  Statham has proven that he is capable of starring in good movies (eg: Transporter 1 & 2.)  But he has typically been denied his real big break ... a producer who cares enough to make the very best.

Oh, and Amazon?  Do the math, okay?",1209254400,9,3373,4.681972789115647
2570985,5,B000FKO3WG,"Transporter  DVD

Transporter is a high action movies involving an ex- special forces soldier who earns his living transporting ""packages"" for various clients, mostly shady.  In this movie the transporter ( Jason Stratham )violates his own rules( he's real big on rules ) and looks inside the package, doesn't like what he sees and doesn't complete the delivery.  Bad idea, now the client is after him, along with the police.  True movie is set in the French countryside so if you don't enjoy the thrill-a-minute action, just enjoy the view.

Transporter 2  DVD

In this sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>Jason Stratham is in Miami working as a chauffer/bodyguard for a wealthy family who springs into action when the young son of his client is kidnapped.  The movie is full of high action car chases and stunts.  Set in the beautiful Miami, Florida area, so again if you don't enjoy high action movies, just sit back and enjoy the view.

Highly recommended for fans of Jason Stratham  , James Bond movies, and high action movies, especially car chases.

The 2nd Transporter relied too heavily on formulaic stunt and special effects to keep the movie exciting.  The principle villains were very week and shallow.  The plot was very weak.  Watching the 2nd Transporter right after the 1st one, really emphasizes the inadequacies of the 2nd movie.  It really suffers in close comparison.

That's not to say that Transporter 2 was a complete failure.  It wasn't.  The fight scene where Frank Martin makes use of a fire hose to defeat a group of assailants was very enjoyable to watch.  It was a very creative example of using a common object as a highly unorthodox weapon.

The moments that I disliked most were the wildly improbable removal of the bomb from the underside of Frank's Audi and his ludicrous use of a common, wooden door to stop rounds from a pair of sub-machine guns at very close range in the doctor's office.",1516492800,,1095,4.640625
