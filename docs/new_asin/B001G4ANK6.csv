8303782,4,B001G4ANK6,"A cut-above documentary with alot of rare footage but more importantly, close-up, heartful and very informative interviews (apparently filmed not long after Mickey's passing in August of 1995) with the likes of Reggie Jackson, Phil Linz, Moose Skowron, Whitey Ford, Hank Bauer, Bobby Mercer, Billy Martin, Jr., Joe Torre, Regis Philbin, George Steinbrenner (not that any of these men would care, but the camera captures them with the worst lighting possible) ...and particularly engrossing, the great Announcer Mel Allen, who eloquently speaks on his favorite athlete and close friend.

As this is really a ""memorial"", there is no mention of struggle, as a competitive player, other than the 1951 (initial) disappointment which send him temporarily back to the Minors. The fans' boos I guess were more out of frustration than anger in the early years - and even some ""prime"" years - but they did occur....also Manager Casey Stengel never challenged Mickey to ""lead*. That title/role went to ever-durable Berra and the golden boy, Ford. When MM hit 52 homeruns one year, Casey expressed his disappointment that he didn't hit more.

This reviewer collects alot of Mantle books and DVDs and this effort does look very familiar, but a ""safety"" copy isn't too hard to take, in this case.

For the new fan, the clips and general narrative, with mucgh empahasis on his extraordinary skills, monsterous, switch-hitting power and lightning speed (all with very difficult, inhibiting injuries) just might excite the inaguination. And maybe get a kid to hit pitches from his Father/Mother, in the backyard; and play hard.",1369526400,,1610,5.2084942084942085
