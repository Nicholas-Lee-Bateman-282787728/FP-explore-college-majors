8368953,5,B002FE5XRY,"This international 3 disc combo from Palisades Tartan features 'Sheitan', a gut-grabbing French fright-fest starring Vincent Cassel (the delectable Monica Bellucci's real-life husband), and is a mass of demented energy infused with some creepy humor (and I`m not a big fan of horror/comedies, tho the comedy`s kept to a minimum) before all hell breaks loose over a weekend in the country. Next up is 'Slaughter Night', a Dutch slasher flick with a few new twists of murder and mayhem we don`t usually get to see in most American horror films, and some realistic special effects. Lastly, there`s 'Carved', an Asian horror entry based on a bit of folklore suffused with some great effects and a handful of genuinely WTF moments, altho it`s the weakest of the three films, IMHO. A great value for the bucks, especially if you get it from a second-tier seller on Amazon. Horror fans seeking something  different should enjoy this set thoroughly.",1272585600,3,941,5.032051282051282
