8084118,4,B000BB1962,Not as powerful as the firts series and the ending is abrupt and quite obviously meant to have lead onto a third series but never id--sadly.,1419897600,,140,4.423076923076923
8084119,5,B000BB1962,"This was a very interesting dramatic series from the UK...and I quite enjoyed it. It reminded me of the West Wing that was on some years ago here in the US. However, the West Wing's President Bartlet never had his own personal 007 like the Ambassador in this particular tv series.",1347148800,,280,4.509803921568627

8084121,5,B000BB1962,"I enjoyed this the first time I rented it, I just had to purchase it and season 2 also. I have since passed it on to several friends and they have also enjoyed it.  It's one of many I will watch again & again. Most entertaining.
I enjoy most movies that have Pauline Collins in them. C.W.",1237507200,,288,4.052631578947368
8084122,4,B000BB1962,"This series should surely appeal to fans of soap operas.
 However that is only because we have a strong female character in a position of power who deals with her job and her romanantic life. This might seem like the kiss of death to a horror/action fan like myself but it is a  series with good stories and excellent acting. Because of this you can enjoy this story with your lady friend or by yourself, because it's well done. And it's not like a soap opera because the stories are grounded in reality and believable.  She must weave her responsibilties with her desire for a love life and this is hard for any middle aged person as it is!.  This is a drama show and not a action series and it will definitely please many female viewers but it's also a good watch for anyone with a tolerance of romantic dramas starring middle age women characters.  And it's good enough to be interesting beyond the tolerance level (for average guys) because of the great acting from it's lead and supporting actors. I won't go into the stories but  they are about the U.K. ambassador in Ireland and that would be a tricky place for any public servant from the UK;  and the stories are believable and not absurd and that says alot for a this type of drama.",1235088000,6,1242,4.421052631578948
8084123,5,B000BB1962,"i really loved this series.  sad that there are only two.  love denis lawson - had first seen him in bleak house.  fun to see him here in a very different role, but think he is one you will want to see in any role he takes on.  and the same can be said of pauline collins.  she is wonderful.  a strong woman of conviction who handles the irish/english relations with great wisdom and a woman's touch, which sets the chauvinists around her on edge.  very well-written.",1227052800,2,467,4.2988505747126435
8084124,5,B000BB1962,"These are well acted, developed and thought stories on the complexity of our human condition. The reality of the shades of gray of everyday life are presented compassionated and realistic manner. Highly recommended.",1174694400,3,215,5.545454545454546
8084125,5,B000BB1962,"I concur with the previous reviewer that ""The Ambassador"" is British TV at its best--great script, great direction, and MOST OF ALL great acting!  The program is really highly entertaining keeping this viewer on the edge of  his seat!

Since the series ""Upstairs Downstairs"" from the 1970s, Pauline Collins has been a favorite actress of mine.  In this series, she proves that she can do heavy dramas as well as comedies with the best of them.  She is so very convincing as the British ambassador to Ireland.  She portrays so very well a character that is very proficient at her job while at the same time, she is good at balancing being a widow, a single mom, a woman in a man's world (the men she works with DO question her almost every decision).  No matter how tense or threatening the situation may be,she comes across as a caring human being that always tries to bring some humanity to her decision making.  In fact, this series is filled with great actors--many that I've seen in other British presentations.

The ""bottom line"" for me is that ""the Ambassador"" series is GREAT entertainment!  It shows what a really good T.V. program can be!! I was highly entertained--great and timely stories plus great acting--wow!

If you want to see what a great TV program is like, buy this DVD.",1173052800,4,1290,4.663716814159292
8084126,5,B000BB1962,"This has everything that one expects of British television entertainment -- compelling plots, convincing acting, topical themes such as nuclear power and the war against drugs.  It has something more, a portrayal of how outcomes can change when a trace of humanity is displayed by those in power.  The deplorable dumbing down of the American media in recent years is nowhere evident here.  Choose this one, if you are a self-respecting enthusiast of contemporary drama for the discriminating and socially aware.",1161993600,7,511,5.283950617283951
8084127,5,B000BB1962,"This is one of the very best modern television series  available.  Pauline Collins, a skilled comedienne, proves that she can handle a challenging dramatic role with immense skill and subtlety.  The rest of the cast is similarly outstanding.  The series, a product of  several different writers, concerns the English ambassador to Ireland (Collins), her two sons, and several of her assistants.  Each story, set in the present, is completely absorbing.  There is a noticeable absence of sex and violence, intelligence being used in their place.  Five stars.",1135814400,36,557,5.32183908045977
