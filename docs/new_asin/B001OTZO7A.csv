3736335,5,B001OTZO7A,"I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it better than ""The White Lioness""--another Wallendar movie. Rolf Lassgrd is fun to watch. This Wallendar film had a lot of depth and I will watch it more than once.",1264809600,7,202,4.486486486486487
3736336,1,B001OTZO7A,"I thought the Wallander detective story ""One Step Behind"" was one of Mankell's best. I've seen the BBC version and this Swedish version. This was just awful. The plot was completely trashed. Virtually rewritten, and  for the worst. And this really was no Wallander. The BBC although lacking is better. And the ""Firewall"" episode you get there isn't too bad.",1256169600,11,357,4.95
3736341,5,B001OTZO7A,My favorite Wallander actor. The others were quite good but this seems closer to Mankel's intent. Followed the book more closely. Wish I could see more of these.,1472774400,,161,4.785714285714286
3736342,5,B001OTZO7A,This is the 5th of the Rolf Lassgard Wallander episodes I've seen and it might be my favorite Wallander period. It's definitely one of my favorite. Each one of the actors who have played Wallander certainly add something to the role. I still Krister Henriksson best but I think I like Lassgard better than Kenneth Branagh. I really like them all. I'm now hooked and hope I can find the other Lassgard miniseries in the future.,1470096000,,426,4.618421052631579

3736351,3,B001OTZO7A,"A little disappointing. Had seen a few of the Lassgard Wallanders but this one missed the mark for me. Too much suspension of disbelief.

3736356,5,B001OTZO7A,"The slow, tortuous path to the end is worth every minute of viewing.  This, here, shows Wallander reflecting  amongst all the secrets, the one, true friend who reveals they are all friends and lovers never really getting what they want, but still left with all that they need.

3736361,4,B001OTZO7A,"I loved the Krister Henriksson, Johanna Sallstrom, Wallander series.  This one is good too, and Steget Efter does a good Wallander (frankly, this was the fourth movie I saw with Efter and he has grown on me), but I really love Krister Henriksson.  This is better than the British BBC series as far as I am concerned.  I was not disappointed.",1381449600,,341,4.557377049180328
3736362,4,B001OTZO7A,wish you would let customers just rate things without having to write a review.  This is very annoying. I don't want to write a review to rate everything I watch or use from Amazon.  Be like Netflix and give us the option of just using a star rating and write a review if we wish but do not require both.  I don't have time to do both so I just don't do either.,1379203200,2,361,3.9178082191780823

That said this actors version of Wallander was good but they really screwed up the story.  Parts no longer made sense.  While we are on the subject - I am not impressed by the Kenneth Branough version - focuses to much on his love life and he never listens to opera!",1364083200,,357,4.144927536231884

3736369,5,B001OTZO7A,"All three actors who have played Wallander, the Swedish detective, to the screen have brought their own interpretation.  I LOVED the novels and have read all of them, one after the other, just a few years ago. The novels are so intricately layered and Kurt is so well developed in them that any of these actors had his work cut out for him in tackling the novels for the screen.  I like all three interpretations but this actor IS Kurt Wallander in every respect.  I must warn any reader of the novel though that none of these video adaptations can ever live up to the novels.  There is just no way they can cover that intricacy in an hour and a half to two hours. I think it is probably impossible to ever bring the novels fully to the screen unless someone could make a miniseries out of each one.  Nevertheless, it is a formidable achievement to become Kurt Wallander onscreen so this is currently as good as it gets for Wallander fans. Kenneth Branagh does a very good job but I never believe he is Swedish.

3736370,5,B001OTZO7A,"There are a couple of versions of  Mankell's Wallander series:Rolf Lassagard and  Krister Henriksson (Swedish with subtitles) and a BBC version with Kenneth Branagh. I really need to get the books to compare them with the videos, but I think each video version brings their own strengths and interpretations to the complex and troubled Detective Wallander. I started watching the BBC version from the Masterpiece Mystery replays, then found the others from Amazon on Demand. I get the BBC version from my Prime membership, but did purchase One Step Behind (Lassagard) and Before the Frost (Henriksson). Granted the Swedish versions are standard definition and can be a bit soft (esp. on a large flat screen), but if you can allow yourself to get past that, I hope you will also enjoy the story lines, the realistic cast and scenery like I did.",1356739200,,843,4.929577464788732
3736371,5,B001OTZO7A,"How could anyone be a better Wallander than the  Krister Henriksson or Branagh? Needless to say I wasn't expecting Rolf Lassgard to be better, but I was really surprised at how good he is and the difference he brings to the character of Kurt Wallander. Lassgard is a big sort of lumbering guy, and I thoroughly enjoyed his interpretation of Wallander - so much so that I wish all of the movies with him in the role were available on quality DVDs. The ones available now are not the best quality DVDs and this one would not even play on my friend's DVD player (it played just fine on mine). It's worth the risk.",1355875200,2,610,4.350877192982456
3736372,4,B001OTZO7A,Usually watch the Krister Henriksson Wallender so very pleased this was as good. Really enjoyed this younger version of Wallender,1354320000,,129,5.5
3736373,3,B001OTZO7A,Not HD. Non-anamorphic. That about says it all. If you like Wallander you'll enjoy the story. Pic quality is low though. Not worth the money.,1353369600,,141,4.68
3736374,5,B001OTZO7A,"I have seen the Swedish Series Wallander and was astounded by it.  I have seen the English Series with Kenneth Branagh and was amazed that they had not relocated the story to England, but kept it in Sweden where it is routed.  This made for a much better retelling of the Wallander stories with some added ones.  The film Wallander, One Step Behind was an exceptional piece.  Like The Millenium Trilogy otherwise known as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Trilogy, I have found that I have a need for really top notch, edge of my seat fare and that it seems the Nordic sources seem to be the most cold bloodedly wonderful that I have ever experienced.  Bravo, Sweden.  (Note:  Please let up on Mr. Assange.)",1352246400,8,705,4.503937007874016
3736375,5,B001OTZO7A,"It's very different because the principal character, Wallander, suffers from depression and gets so focused on his case that he forgets about the rest of his world which includes friends and family.  The series is what I would call ""dark"".  There's no humor in them.",1350777600,,266,4.888888888888889
3736376,5,B001OTZO7A,"Ok yeah I have now seen al ost all the versions of Wallander. And naturally I do like the Swedish Johanna Sllstrm,
Krister Henriksson,
Ola Rapace....ones, all 26? of them.  But I did like this Rolf one.  Supposedly same story as One step Behind even though when played it said MIDSUMMERS EVE...."". Whatever, same basic story as the Kennth B BBC one.  I actually liked some of the new twists...or I suppose I should say old twists because this one came first.  Quite complicated, subtitles zooming by fast...frankly if I had not read the book I may have been lost.
Also I did find the odd camera/flashback device very interesting...letting us ""see"" what Kurt was thinking...key to his type of intuitive solving mode....you know tha thing where Kalle appears on film as we hear him on tape or as Kurt FEELS him..his presence .  I liked that.  I supposed if this was the only Wallander that you just happened upon you might not get all the nuances of his character..the whole history, as it were...BUT it still would be an enjoyable film.  Plus you are hugely luckily because now you got like 26 & 8 more to look forward too.  I had to laugh when I read someone's comment about a random early Wallander...the guy commented "" I liked the blonde woman cop""....this was the only episode he saw and was referring to an amazing..enchanting ...key actress Johanna, playing key key role of Linda.  GAD....her she acts very much like herself, depressed..stressed...just fantastic ...and as many of you know kills herself...so tragic, so upsetting.......that blonde cop....gad....kinda lame....?....
So enjoy this one and then enjoy them all.  I havemreadmall the books too.  I assume you have found the fan site ?..[...]. Not sure if this will paste a link. It has nice lists to track all the versions...mostlynupmtomdate..except for season 3 kenneth B new ones. Sept 2012 in USA.",1348272000,2,1869,4.845911949685535
3736377,5,B001OTZO7A,Lassgard is the original and best TV incarnation of Kurt Wallander and this is a superb version of Mankell's novel.  Stylistically similar to the BBCs equally excellent version of the story this one just about wins any contest by virtue of Lassgard's brilliance in the role. Top quality TV.,1338163200,,290,4.918367346938775
3736378,4,B001OTZO7A,"I just finished watching this video version of the Mankell book, which I have recently re-read so I was quite familiar with the plot and characters.  I have also seen the Branagh BBC version, which followed the plot much more closely.  Altho the screenplay for this Swedish-made video differs considerably from the book, I put aside my prejudices and found it all quite compelling. Rolf Larsgaard conveys the anguish of his character, Wallander, as he slowly realizes he had kept his friend Svedberg so much at arms' length that he did not know him at all.  I liked that the killer was not just a psychopath, but he had real motivation for the murders in his sense of lost love.
Highly recommended.",1317427200,,698,4.704918032786885
3736379,4,B001OTZO7A,"I got this because I had already purchased the BBC version with Kenneth Branagh and wanted to compare the interpretation of the Wallander character between the two.  I wasn't disappointed.  Rolf Lassagard's Wallander was quite close to the one depicted in the novel, as was Branagh's. The story lines were quite different in overall direction and details.

I definitely recommend this dvd to all Mankell fans.  I wish more of these original TV Wallander episodes would made available in the US.",1305504000,5,494,5.061728395061729
3736380,4,B001OTZO7A,"Thanks to Amazon for making one of the original Swedish Wallander film available to US fans!

First off, yes, the movie is produced as a DVDR by Amazon, but the quality all around is quite top-notch.  The packing itself looks professional, and the video quality of the movie looks wonderful and doesn't suffer one bit.  Buying a DVDR movie sounds strange, I'm sure, but Amazon produces a good product.

Secondly, and most importantly, the movie.

(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD)

I've only seen one of the other original Wallander films - ""The White Lioness"", which is the only other one available in Region 1 with English subtitles.  While that one looked rather...shoddy production-wise, ""One Step Behind"" is a huge step up.  This movie is polished and slick, and looks beautiful.

Now, the story here has been tweaked somewhat, but not to the point where it detracts from the material.  Another reviewer here criticizes the film for butchering the story and not following the novel at all.  Frankly, I'd like to know what movie he/she was watching.  Yes, there are changes made, but the story remains intact, and still deals with the murder of three teenagers and one of Wallander's colleagues, Svedberg, and the team must start investigating his life in order to understand his connection with these killings.  There are characters added and others excised from the film, but again, nothing that detracts from the story.  Though this film seems to skimp on Wallander's own personal dramas, they try to compensate by giving Wallander a coworker (not from the novels) whom he dated previously.

But none of the thrills or suspense are sacrificed.  Having read the novel and watched the BBC version with Kenneth Branagh, I still enjoyed it thoroughly, and recommend it to all Mankell/Wallander fans out there.",1265760000,14,1801,5.013468013468014

8331485,3,B001OTZO7A,"Although this was not a bad movie and the lead actor is quite skilled, I must say that I've been spoiled by the superb Henning Mankell's Wallander TV series, currently on Netflix and VUDU, starring Krister Hendriksson.",1504828800,,218,4.918918918918919
8331486,5,B001OTZO7A,"Wallander: One Step Behind is one of the movies from the original series of films that have been adapted from the detective novels of the acclaimed Swedish crime author Henning Mankell. The Wallander series essentially represents a combination of a detective procedural and a personal drama, the first iteration of which is a Swedish language version with English subtitles. The story line is centered around Kurt Wallander, who is depicted as a tired and troubled veteran Swedish homicide detective, who is overweight, out of shape, and who drinks excessively. In addition, Kurt Wallander suffers from an extremely dysfunctional personal life, primarily caused by his fundamental problem with communication, and his inability to adequately express his feelings. This has resulted in the inevitable divorce from his wife, a tumultuous and complicated relationship with his daughter, and serious difficulty maintaining relationships with women in general. Although Kurt Wallander sometimes looks scruffy and disheveled, and often displays an extremely volatile demeanor, his unkempt appearance and his obvious emotional volatility belie his exceptional investigative skills and acumen. When he is able to focus, Kurt Wallander is a masterful detective, who is hyper-observant, systematic, and analytical, with an uncanny ability to solve complex homicide cases. The Wallander films are characterized by excellent writing and plot development, featuring murder mysteries that are exceedingly intriguing, gripping, and suspenseful, replete with many interesting twists. Rolf Lassgard delivers an absolutely outstanding performance with his brilliant portrayal of Detective Kurt Wallander, and the acting performances of the supporting cast members are also stellar. Wallander is a decidedly intelligent, engaging, and entertaining detective series from Sweden, which certainly merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1501200000,2,1943,6.043478260869565
8331487,5,B001OTZO7A,As I said in another review of White Lioness. Rolf is my favorite of the three actors doing Wallendar and I like all three a lot.,1500681600,,129,4.0

8331489,5,B001OTZO7A,"When I discovered this film I was excited to see how the director would handle the extremely complex story line of Mankell's novel, which I think is one of the best in the Wallander series.  Given the time constraints of film, the director was forced to drop much of the detail of the novel and take some artistic license with the murderer, but the result was an equally compelling drama that is extremely well acted.  Birger Larsen makes a more than passable Wallander, though I continue to prefer Krister Henriksson's ""everyman"" interpretation of the detective in the full Swedish series, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent.  If you are a Wallander fan and have already made your way through the novels and the Swedish and British videos, this is a worthy conclusion to the experience.  As I said, the story is very complex and required both Wallander and the watcher to pay attention to detail and keep re-thinking what has happened.  At the end of the day, I am of the view that this and the other Swedish versions are superior to Branagh's British take on the Swedish detective, who unlike Larsen, Henniksson, and Rof Lassgard, made him considerably darker than the admittedly confused and sometimes tortured man Mankell created for his novels.",1485820800,,1261,4.873831775700935
8331490,4,B001OTZO7A,"Wallander, The a Swedish novels, series and now in film ,has long been a favorite of mine. There is the Swedish TV series, and the Englishbtv series. I much prefer the Swedish version.  We need Walkander to look like the Swedish man I invision.

In this film, we find a horrible death of three young people, found much after the fact. One if Walkander'S colleagues, a man who has been in the Swedish detective group for 20 years, is having a great deal if difficulty. No one knows what is going on exactly, justvthat something is not right. The group discovers they do not know much about this man, and then he ends up dead. Four murders in all, and shows killing young people and a policeman? This is an excellent film, full of surprises, but we can guess some of the issues. Wallander has a good mind for murder, and clues come to him. His group is scrappy but well defined. Lots of excitement and action, and a need for some psychotherapy I think.
