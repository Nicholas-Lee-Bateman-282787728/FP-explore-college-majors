I did not realize it at the time and it was not mentioned in the description of the product.  I think the dvd was over priced for what we got.  How do you explain to a 5 year old that the dvd was just one short clip and not a movie or multiple episodes.  All the other TRAIN YOUR DRAGONS were over 30 minutes... I expected the same from this one.... SO BUYER BEWARE.

8408483,5,B003XQ2U1K,"My whole family has a special place for this kid-friendly movie that is based on Cressida Cowell's series of kids' books of the same name. To start off, the movie is virtually nothing like the books, in that the story revolves around Hiccup, a klutzy Viking boy, his father, village chief Stoick the Vast, and a girl he likes, Astrid and most importantly Toothless, a dragon he attempts to kill and later befriends.

This animated movie begins with a narration by Hiccup about his village, and about how dreadful life is there, especially due to the pest problem - dragons! It seems the only reason these Vikings haven't abandoned this gloomy area is because of their stubbornness issues. As the story evolves, the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless (who doesn't quite live up to that name!) becomes stronger, and they both discover the truth about dragons and why they are such big nuisance, and they both team up to keep the village safe and to free the dragons.

The Legend of the BoneKnapper Dragon is a short movie that's very funny that's a good short to see after seeing the main movie.

Overall this is a great story that will appeal to all age groups, and the animation is superb, with wonderful music throughout! I would highly recommend this movie for a present or just for yourself!",1324771200,,1299,4.713656387665198
