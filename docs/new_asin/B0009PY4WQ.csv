Have fun, my daughter and I did.",1282435200,,86,3.5789473684210527
2312265,5,B0009PY4WQ,"The ideal way to get instructed! Sitting in front of the television, no more 'i think there's a step or picture missing in this book'...
After watching the set I feel totally confident creating my own designs without being too scared to screw up. All things I could think of, wanting to start to tie-dye and create durable designs, are in the set.

For all you who don't live in the USA, being a DVD-Region 1, I myself took the gamble in ordering this set, since I live in Europe, which is DVD-Region 2. My only hope in viewing the discs was my laptop, on which the DVD-region can be changed only four times. But reading the product description and reviews, I decided this was the best investment for me to get to know the do's and don'ts on tie-dying.
Only nine days after ordering, I received my set (thank you Amazon and international shipping company!) which played in my laptop without even adjusting the region-settings! Later I tried to play them on my (very old, region-2-coded) DVD-player and (even older PAL)TV-set and again had no trouble at all playing the DVDs. Ofcourse I can't give any garantees to all 'non-region 1'-viewers this set will play on your (regionally coded) system. I just know I'm very glad the gamble paid off for me.
The only hurdle I have to overcome is that all quantities are non-metric, but this was a hurdle to be expected. The temperatures are mentioned first in Fahrenheit, but also in Celcius, so no problems there.",1227312000,,1455,4.617760617760617
2312266,5,B0009PY4WQ,"Being very new to tie dyeing I purchased this 3-volume set and it is better than I could have imagined. The instructions are very detailed every step of the way, including explanations of all of the ingredients used, how to mix the different solutions, how exactly to tie the shirts to get the results shown, you get a list of helpful tools, a list of suppliers for all items used in the clips etc.
Disc 1 had a scratch when I received the DVD's, but after contacting Tom from [...], he had me send the scratched disc back and replaced it with a brand new one in record time. A+++++ on customer service there!
I highly recommend the 3-volume set (which is a better deal than purchasing each volume separate) to anyone, beginner or advanced.",1212192000,3,740,4.488888888888889
2312267,5,B0009PY4WQ,"This is an excellent set of DVDs for learning everything from beginner to advanced techniques for doing tie dye. The instructors give very clear, detailed instructions on safety, folding, tying and dyeing techniques. I also like that after they run through the instructions they have a fast visual review of how the tie was done, using stop motion photography that makes it look like the item is folding all by itself with no human intervention. In addition, they tend to do at least two sample variations of each tie and show several examples of that tie different color schemes at the end of a segment. Finally, they show you how to get an idea of how your own folding and tying designs will look on paper, for mandala type designs, before doing the actual dying process. I was specifically looking for how to do mandala/lotus blossum patterns which are not easy to find instructions for and the instructions on the DVD are far better than the only instructions I found on the web. This set is absolutely wonderful.

The only problems I have with these DVDs are small: 1) they assume you have your own washer that you can stop mid cycle and set to spin (commercial washers don't generally allow this), 2) they assume you can crank up your water heater temporarily for the wash-out, 3) although they dye silk and rayon (in addition to t-shirts) in the videos, to the best of my recollection they don't bring up some of the specific issues involved with these fabrics (black fiber reactive dye doesn't take well on silk, dyes color shift on silk, rayon is VERY fragile while wet, etc.) and 4) the music between sections is louder than the verbal instructions, so I had to keep adjusting the volume. The first two issues affect me because I live in an apartment. The third issue may not be much of a problem since I suspect people who are doing silk and rayon have generally done some additional research. The fourth issue is livable, and I might just be more sensitive to volume changes than most people.

The pros far outweigh the cons, which is why I'm giving it five stars. By the way, here's a link to some examples of their work on their website [...] . Some, but not all, of these are pictures of the sample projects they did in the video.",1188518400,12,2245,4.554455445544554
2312268,5,B0009PY4WQ,"In the unique world of Tie Dye, I am a professional who has made thousands of T-shirts, sheets, curtains, baby clothes and even boxer shorts.  I have supplied dozens of stores from Daytona Beach to Miami with T-shirts and more, followed the Grateful Dead on tours, and sold T-shirts through mail order.  With the exception of a very few pointers, I have found information on the creation of high quality tie dyes to be very illusive.  I have read countless books, most of which contained the same extremely basic and often inaccurate information.  The majority of my ""tie dye education"" has come through several years of very expensive trial and error...and believe me, there are many many possible errors to be made.

  Tom & Martine have created nothing shy of the ""Holy Grail"" of How to Tie Dye DVD's.  I have never seen anything that comes even close to the quality of this set.  If you know absolutely nothing about tie dye, buy this DVD set and you will have every necessary piece of information you need to make amazing tie dyes.  Everything from how to do it, to where to get everything you need to do it.  If you are a seasoned tie dye professional, you still want to buy this DVD set.  You will find several tips which will save you money, save you time and effort, and make tie dying much more enjoyable.

  I don't know how Tom and Martine managed to put a price on their invaluable DVD set...at 10 times the selling price, it would still be worth every penny!

2312269,5,B0009PY4WQ,"Tom and Martine have done a wonderful job illustrating their long time,earned experience with the wonderful and colorful process of tie dyeing.  I am a tie dyer myself, have seen other videos on the market, and this is the best.  I have learned a lot from them.  Their presentation, format, explanation, funky music score, illustration of the process with a speeded up review at the end of each lesson is really fun to watch and helps you learn it and remember it. And then theres the bloopers and inserts...too funny! I highly recommend to any new tie dyer to get this and learn it right.  I also recommend it to seasoned dyers as Tom and Martine make some very good points about chemistry to achieve optimum results.  As far as tie patterns go, they are wonderful, gorgeous and brilliant. Better than a class as you can view the DVD over and over again.

TIE DYE LIVES !!!  And more and more people are appreciating it for the art form that it is.  Thanks Tom and Martine for educating us in how to get the primo results we all love to see.

You can't be depressed and wear tie dye!

2312280,5,B0009PY4WQ,good,1416268800,,4,4.0
2312281,5,B0009PY4WQ,">.. I have extensively reviewed youtube videos on tie-dyeing, then I came across their video on youtube about tying the""desperado"" (MJ leaf) t-shirt. It was so specific and useful that I looked for other videos by them. All I found were previews of these videos. But based on the ""desperado"" video, I was pretty sure they were worth the price.
>.. Having now seen all of them just once, I am convinced that the information is presented clearly, even to the point of dyeing of alternate fabrics. They use Procion MX fiber-reactive dyes, and they make the point about why. In addition they don't just list mixing instructions, they actually show themselves mixing the needed chemicals as well. Instructions are very clear, including repeated demonstrations of the folding techniques, and how to tie them with sinew, not rubber bands or string, and exactly where to tie them and why.
>.. The first disk is primarily safety and chemical mixing oriented, but it does discuss several ties for common designs, like swirl and in what order to dye them. They have zero muddy colors and no browns unless appropriate to the design. This disk also shows you how to mix two or more colors to get different hues (variations on colors) and intensities (how much or how little water to add for each level of intensity). These were worth the cost of that disk alone. They clearly show how to make all the colors of the rainbow using 4 colors and black. They use different dispenser tips than I've seen elsewhere and that is why they have so few odd spots on their shirts. It is not like ""it's all good"" if you do make a mistake, though I much prefer cleaner designs and no muddy spots on the shirts I do.
>.. Discs 2 and 3 are focused on many interesting and exciting folds and ties, and then they demonstrate slowly and then repeat the folds in stop motion again, before they dye. On most they want these advanced folds to be soaked and then dried before the dyeing. They note every time that this takes several days and to plan ahead for the delay. They do not recommend using the dryer for this purpose.
>.. Micro-waving is discussed as a requirement for setting the dyes in SILK, and it is mentioned that it is possible to advance the time needed to set the dyes in cotton, BUT they also make the point that heating cotton can burn the the fabric (if you're inattentive), AND that it blunts the dye colors if they are heated. They clearly want you to have the best outcome and are very thorough in demonstrating each step.
>.. A minor issue: they show the old form of Calgon water softener, and do not put a note in with the dvd's to show that a different softener is required (sodium metaphosphate, I believe) and that it can be ordered from their regular suppliers. I think that would be a courtesy that their customers would really appreciate. A brief note about this could be taped to the dvd box and save their customers some grief if they are new to tie dyeing.
>.. A real plus: they put a safety review, and mixing overview as a tag-end of disks 2 and 3. It is important to develop good habits and to always keep safety in mind. They go over this in the first DVD very thoroughly, and could have assumed that every one sees that, but they were thoughtful enough to add this to each of the advanced discs as well. This is very thoughtful I think.
>.. Who would benefit from these: It is not necessary for young children, as they would likely be bored with the detail (I was when I was young). And they would likely use something from Walmart. But for those who are interested in doing more than one or two t-shirts, this is the clearest presentation I've ever seen. What's more is the professionalism they exhibit and the clear powerful examples of color choices. Teachers of High School kids in the arts would do well to have this on hand, both as a review for themselves and to use certain chapters in the first disc to show to their students. Those who are professionals or even semi-professionals (like retired people, or others who are interested in a little extra money (over the Summer, for example). Doing shirts from the instructions here would make YOUR shirts better than the competition. The first disk would be excellent instructions for anyone interested in dying cotton, rayon or silk. AS you can tell from the reviews, it is very well received by all who buy this 3 volume set!",1408147200,2,4386,4.525188916876575
2312282,5,B0009PY4WQ,"Great set of DVDs to get you started learning how to tie dye.  I've been able to start and continue dying for the past 2 years, I am constantly using the foundation of dying that I learned from these videos.  If you want to learn how to tie dye correctly, make this investment!

I wish the couple would come up with another, even more advanced DVD!!",1398124800,,349,4.257575757575758
2312283,5,B0009PY4WQ,"I had hesitantly bought this 3 - volume DVD set because of the price, and because I had also wondered ""do I really need to buy all 3 of these Tie Dying DVD's?""
Wow!!! I found myself impressed realizing these DVD's are a must have for all those who want to learn Tie Dying, and how to best prepare the dyes. For Tie Dyeing was wonderfully and easily taught in steps that even us beginners could understand with stunning results ;-) I can also see what I have learned being a good foundation, to get me started in coming up with mine own designs. I can see my watching and learning from these DVD's saving me both money and time, in my journey of learning tie dying.
These DVD's also teach how to make many colors from 4 primary/basic dye colors. Without having the expense of having to buy each of the many colors used/made.
Included DVD's cover...
Tie Dye 101 - The Basics of Making Exceptional Tie Dye (1 hour 27 minutes)
Tie Dye 202 - Making Shapes with Tie Dye (55 minutes plus review) - Guides you through making hearts, arrows, stars, peace signs, aliens and more.
Tie Dye 303 - Mandalas, Suns and Lotus Blossoms (1 hour 5 minutes, plus review)

On a negative note... if you are sound/tone sensitive, then the music within these DVD's might make them hard to listen to. It is quite loud, and I found it very distracting and annoying.",1391558400,2,1338,4.395161290322581
2312284,5,B0009PY4WQ,"It has a bit of a homemade feel to it but WOW, extremely thorough and informative. Everything from chemicals to processes are detailed in a clear, organized and cohesive format. Each disc has a review and troubleshooting segment at the end to discuss possible errors and how to correct them, this was extremely helpful. I've been tie dying for years and purchased the set to hopefully learn some new techniques, which I did, but I also found improvements to my own process. If you just have an inclination to dye or you've done it awhiile I highly recommend this set of discs.",1381968000,,576,4.6568627450980395
2312285,5,B0009PY4WQ,"This DVD set was very helpful. I knew how to do the basic tie-dye designs before, but the two on this dvd really show their expertise down to a science. They show you some simple and gradually more complicated designs as well as teach you techniques to use on all your clothes and fabrics. From teaching you how to mix and prepare your dyes correctly, to the detailed ways to fold shirts and apply the dye, they cover everything you need to know. They explain it clear and slow enough to retain the information, but also, they show you a close look at the steps in a way that you can watch them do it and see how they do everything.",1376956800,,632,4.231404958677686
