Caine and Bologna play  marvelously off each other reminicent of Walter Mathow and Jack Lemon.  Good writing and a terrific supporting cast including a teenage and throaty  voiced Demi Moore as Canie's daughter make this a movie not to be missed.  While the subject matter may be taboo...remember...it is a comedy.",943142400,11,497,4.9397590361445785

1257156,5,B000035P6F,This has been one of my favorite movies since it first came out. I was a dorky teenager at the time & was totally captivated by the script. Michael Caine's humor gets me every time.,1517616000,,181,4.2

1257159,2,B000035P6F,"The Blu-ray transfer is definitely better--sharper-- than the DVD. It looks ""new"" on my Hi-Def TV's screen, vs. ""old"" for the previous DVD, due to better sharpness.

However, this Kino-Lorber Blu-ray strangely has a slight yellow-green tint to the picture throughout, which is NOT present in the DVD nor the British-release Blu-ray (Region ""B"" only), which I'd purchased at Amazon UK last year (and which was cheaper; but, you need an all-region BR player for it).  With the great, better color-paletted British-version Blu-ray transfer already available, it's unfortunate that K-L had to mess up the tint of this one.

Also, at least on my 60"" Samsung's screen, the English subtitles are unusually small on this new Kino-Lorber release-- so if you're hard of hearing, your eyesight had better be good!

For fans of this extremely funny film, one of the best comedies I've ever seen, with lots of clever, timeless humor delivered by Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna (credit the writer, of course), this blu-ray is worth getting.  But, as is so often the case with Kino-Lorber Blu-ray releases (as with Olive Films and other small, classic DVD/Blu-ray houses), they could have done a better job.",1515456000,,1194,5.071428571428571

Every man has their own story of loving this movie but to me, it was part of my childhood (ha ha).  It ranks up their with Sesame Street as far as personal impact in my life.  The first time I saw this movie I just turned into my teens.  It was an edited version they showed on network television, so nudity and all that.  Even so, it was probably the most erotic movie Ive ever seen so far.  Not until years later did I finally see the unedited version.  Needless to say, I like the unedited version better.

1257255,4,B000035P6F,"This is definitely a ""time capsule"" romantic comedy.  This was filmed in the early 80s so there's very little plastic surgery so the bodies actually look ""real"".  I honestly didn't see a single fake pair of breasts in the entire movie.  There's a scene where Isabella (a minor character) confesses that Victor (played by Joseph Bologna, the darker-haired fellow on the cover) is the 12th man she's been with in the 12 days she's been separated from her husband and Victor is completely blase about it.  Yes, this is before people knew about AIDS.

The comedy revolves around Victor searching for the older gentleman that slept with his daughter so he can pummel him or worse.  He drags Matthew (played by Michael Caine) around to assist in his manhunt even though Matthew is the guilty party.  Hijinks ensue and everything builds to a crescendo before all is revealed.  Michael Caine is pretty much himself in this movie and Joseph Bologna makes a great comic foil.  Demi Moore, who plays Nicole, is surprisingly supportive of her friend's trysts with her father, but doesn't factor into the story much.  Michelle Johnson is good at conveying tenderness and warmth, but was a bit unpolished as an actress otherwise.  I believe she was genuinely 18 at the time this was filmed so I give her a pass.

It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is charming.  Although there's plenty of nudity, I don't think there's any serious profanity (unless you count ""hell"" as vulgar), only minor violence (people getting punched, roughhousing, and a small cut shaving but no serious injury) and there's no actual sex depicted onscreen.  If it wasn't for the scenes at the topless beach and the polaroid Jennifer takes of herself, this would be PG-13.",1483401600,2,1732,4.8668941979522184

1257258,5,B000035P6F,My favorite actor is Michael Caine and I just had to get this movie.  He is so multi talented and he has never disappointed me in a performance.  Doesn't get any better that Michael Caine.,1481241600,,188,4.3428571428571425
1257259,3,B000035P6F,I saw this movie when it first came on one of the cable channels.  I was never a big fan of Michael Caine.  And though he has never really been a big star I do like Joseph Bologna who has played everything from gangsters to being on Married With Children.  Demi Moore plays Michael Caines daughter.  And the only character with any sense.  And Michelle Johnson plays Joseph Bologna's daughter.  And looks hot in every scene she is in.  Whether she is dressed up to go out or making breakfast or taking a nude selfie.  I thought she would have become a bigger star.  She has an affair with Michael Caine and wants to tell the whole world about how much she loves him and of course he wants to keep it secret.  Valarie Harper plays Michael Caine's wife and to complicate things more she as well as Bologna have some secrets of their own.  This movie has scenery and beautiful girls.  Some memorable lines.  It's the kind of movie that can be watched over and still be just as good.,1480032000,2,979,4.342541436464089
1257260,4,B000035P6F,"This comedy hasn't aged as well as some others but still has things to recommend it; the way it is filmed almost make the scenery and cinematography another character in the film.  Anyway seeing the actors in Rio and on the beach and such really adds to the viewing experience.  In addition it's interesting seeing a more zany physically active Michael Caine in this movie compared to the stony gravitas he lent to the Nolan Batman films much later in his career- it's an interesting contrast.  Also some of the dialogue is still funny.  I'll just say that I've never seen the word 'doodah' used in quite the same way before or since except in this movie- you'll know the scene when you see it.  One thing that should be pointed out here though is that there is reallyno character to 'root' for in the whole movie; is a comedy of be trayals really where dysfunctional relationships- even nasty behavior is shown in a light hearted funny way.  An interesting glimpse into the time period in which it was made, it has a strong cast and is worth watching once for the scenery alone but if you're expecting a sweet comedy with some heroic figures this isn't the movie for you; it isn't what I'd call a 'black' comedy but if you stop to think about the plot after you watch it the characters are essentially self centered bitter and somewhat mean to each other for no good reason- so you'll enjoy it more if you know that going in.  Still it's worth watching once if you like the cast.",1479254400,,1480,4.45925925925926

I was pleasantly surprised that it received many good Amazon reviews since then. I'm thrilled with my purchase. Now I can watch it on my iPhone anytime I want. My only regret is that when I ran into Mr. Larry Gelbart in a supper club in the early 1990's in the San Fernando Valley, I didn't mention to him how much I loved his movie. I had not made the connection at the time. I did, however, in a tipsy moment walk up to George Segal and tell him how much I enjoyed him in the movie! Mr. Segal was all grace. He reminded me that he was not in that movie and that it was another actor (Michael Caine) who played in it.

1257408,5,B000035P6F,"Originally saw this in the theatre. Moviegoers in seats ahead of me were falling sideways in their seats from laughing so hysterically.

What has caused some controversy is that the movie starts out quirky and a bit questionable, beginning with the soundtrack/song. The high pitched warble seems a strange choice, but once you see the whole film, it fits quite nicely. Then there's the issue of a slow, even slightly disconcerting start and characters talking to the camera. Hmm. But once the group arrive at the exotically colorful vacation home in the mountains above Rio, the movie become vibrant and the comedy starts to take off. Yes, some of the night scenes are too dark, but if you pay attention, you can still see what's happening. There's comedy in there that you don't want to miss.

Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna are a great battling comedy due. Michelle Johnson's acting was perfect for the part, so comments to the contrary are simply unfounded. Try to imagine the part being acted in any other fashion and nothing else fits. I think some reviewers believed she was just acting herself so didn't ""see"" the acting. But that simply reveals that she's a great actor. Others may not have taken her seriously because she played a somewhat ditsy gal and showed her breasts. Again, the ditsy gal part is called acting. The reveal of bosom was the decision of the writers and director. So grow up.

Regarding the story line, the film does not condone extra-marital affairs and shows just how chaotic and damaging giving in to fantasy can become. Taking the subject matter too seriously would be like criticizing ""Some Like It Hot"" as being a pro-gay platform.

So if you want fantastic scenery, some of the funniest lines in a comedy and a lot of laughs, this is the film for you. Watching it while sipping a fancy tropical drink will make for a perfect pastime.

1257479,3,B000035P6F,"Before the internet, before late-night cable TV shows, before the VCR brought entertainment of all types into the privacy of American homes, there were movies like ""10"", ""The Blue Lagoon"", and ""Blame it on Rio"", whose chief attraction was the opportunity to glimpse beautiful women parade around in nothing or next to it.  Nowadays, of course, much more explicit material can be found with the click of a mouse.  But given that I had seen the first two of those three movies when they were initially released, but not the third, I decided to use the wonders of the internet to go back in time to see how ""Blame it on Rio"" would come across in the year 2011.

The short answer:  ""Blame it on Rio"" is slightly deeper (and longer) than an episode of ""The Love Boat""; it's about on par, as far as psychologically based comedies go, with the Chicago-based version of ""The Bob Newhart Show"".  So there are no insightful commentaries on the human condition contained within the storyline: the basic message, I would say, is that it is awfully hard to remain monogamous for the entire lifetime of a marriage.  The storyline never quite degenerates into a farce, which would probably be an improvement, nor is it dramatic; it is sort of in between.  Thus, the chief attraction, twenty-seven years later, remains the eye candy.

There won't be enough eye candy to satisfy 21st century viewers seeking visual thrills; as I said there is much more explicit content on the internet which is more easily accessible.  But for those who were of age in the 1980s, watching ""Blame it in Rio"" does offer some highlights, while bringing back memories of how entertainment used to be.  The main highlights are Michelle Johnson, who gives what turns out to be the best performance of her career while at the peak of physical perfection of her young nubile self; and the gorgeous portrayal of the city of Rio de Janeiro in a more carefree, innocent time, before it became known more for crime and slums.

The lines that Michelle Johnson has to utter are usually cringe-inducing, or that is they would be if the viewer was paying any attention at all to them, but fortunately she provides ample visual distraction, and for that her performance is to be applauded.  She does a great job shedding her inhibitions.  But surprisingly, in retrospect, the young female actress who went on to much more fame and fortune, and who is even now still on the cover of celebrity magazines, is Demi Moore.  In ""Blame it on Rio"", Demi can't hold a candle next to Michelle Johnson's performance.

""Blame it on Rio"" is recommended only for folks such as myself, who remember the impact it made at the time but didn't see it then.  It is not a classic, or even as good a movie as Blake Edwards' ""10"".",1323561600,,2758,4.6440329218107

I never knew too much about Rio, I'll probably never go there, but I really dig their scene. Groovy acoustic guitars, bongos, parrots, straw huts, topless beaches etc. The perfect atmosphere.

Michelle Johnson is stunningly beautiful and, with Demi Moore, just beginning their respective careers.  Johnson was very young when she filmed the movie, and it is testament to her abilities as an actress that she performed so superbly with such little experience.  I've often wondered why Moore's career took off, while Johnson's didn't.  If this movie serves as any indication of ability and appeal, their career arcs should certainly be reversed.

And let's not forget Valerie Harper.  Torn with an indescribable dilemma,  it is great fun watching her handle the situation at hand.  Superb acting all around.

The plot is a male fantasy of the worst kind - older man seduced by a teenage girl without any negative consequences (""he never really had a chance"", she says, suggesting he doesn't have to feel guilty); because she is his friend's daughter and his daughter's friend there are clear undertones of incest (the daughter confesses she had a crush on her father which might be perfectly innocent in other circumstances but takes on an ominous meaning when her friend takes her own ""crush"" to a very physical level); there is generally poor acting (Michael Caine projects very clearly how awkward he felt about this role, Joseph Bologna is - well, Joseph Bologna, and it's almost incomprehensible why anyone gave another role to Demi Moore after this movie), the soundtrack is awful and the cinematography tired and clich-ridden. The only redeeming feature is Michelle Johnson who is just a joy to watch, with and without her clothes on.

The movie makes you realize how times have changed. I doubt any major Hollywood director would do a film with this much nudity today, which is a pity. 20 years later the US is even more uptight about these things than in Ronald Reagan's time (while hardcore porno movies are sold in the next aisle at your local DVD outlet) - I guess that's progress of a sort ...",1147824000,11,1353,4.733050847457627

1257532,5,B000035P6F,"Beautifully filmed on location in Brazil where Michael Caine steals the show in a hilarious romance, comedy, and light-hearted drama. While Caine and his best friend are separated from their wives on this wild vacation, sharing a private villa with their two daughters, the ""innocent"" daughter of Caine's best friend makes a successful pass at ""Uncle Matthew"" (Caine).  The daughter tells Daddy that she has met and slept with a certain ""kind-of-a-boy,"" yet as she protects the identity of her lover, she insists that Uncle Matthew ""tell Daddy about the romance"" as she believes this is true love. While Cain and his best friend's daughter hide the affair behind her father's back, hilarious twists and turns occur when the father insists that Cain must help him find this ""illegitimate lover,"" as the daughter wants to ""shout it from the mountain tops,"" while Cain is trying to ""keep it quiet.""
Topless scenes, yes even Caine, who buries himself in the sand (being bottomless too), as friends walk up on him just after a romantic interlude at the beach where he so horribly pretends his ignorance/innocence with hilarious stuttering and muddled responses to their inquiries.
 Demi Moore also appears in this movie as Caine's daughter who also ""likes to live dangerously"", hinting at her father's behavior, and that ""even best friends keep things from each other"".
Great aerial views of Rio de Janeiro, lively background music and many Brazilian cultural scenes and nuances make this a highly enjoyable movie. A MUST HAVE for the family and single library!!!!

Plain and simple, this is a story of a middle-aged man conducting an affair with a teenaged girl.  This is not the stuff of comedy, and there is only one name for such a man: a sexual predator.

I'm no prude, and I don't object to such subject matter in and of itself.  For an intelligent, heartbreaking study of a very similar story - both films tell of of young girls seducing adult men - see Adrian Lyne's astonishing production of Vladimir Nabokov's ""Lolita,"" where the male protagonist is drawn as complexly brutal and yet also somehow unsettlingly sympathetic, but is in the end, without question, named for what he is: a monster.  In ""Rio,"" this is all played for laughs: the Michael Caine character is seen as a sort of amusing, lovable dolt, seduced by the 17-year-old daughter of his best friend; we are asked to buy into the idea that he really has no choice, and that his decision to bed the girl is understandable and forgiveable.  Indeed, he suffers no consequences to his actions; he doesn't lose his friendship with the girl's father, and even his wife, it is strongly suggested, eventually forgives him, while the teenager herself rides off into the sunset on the arm of a young man her own age.

Reprehensible stuff indeed.",1126051200,10,1387,4.7615062761506275
1257535,3,B000035P6F,"I love when the amateur psychoanalysts run amok because of a harmless little film such as Blame It on Rio. It is a comedy, for Cristo's sake.  To be more precise, Blame It on Rio is a farce.  Blame It on Rio is not supposed to be about the Electra complex gone awry in Rio de Janeiro. This film has something more in common with Carmen Electra, if you know what I mean. The point is, there simply isn't any room here for overanalyzing in an academic way.  Copacabana Beach and all of those thongs are simply too crowded for that caliber of intellectualism, folks.

Watching the Blame It on Rio DVD, I am instantly transported to the early 1980s, when having sex with strangers was still considered a thrilling dare and not necessarily a death sentence. (Before the film was released, the message of the AIDS pandemic had not yet shocked the world.) At the time, Demi Moore, who in Blame It on Rio was a better actress than Michelle Johnson -- hands and bras down -- was an unknown ""entitty.""

The following year, 1984, Moore and the charismatic Jon Cryer made No Small Affair and both of their careers exploded like Malcolm McLaren's ""Eiffel Tower"" song on the movie's bercool soundtrack.  Hollywood may have only taken a budding interest in Moore when she modestly bared her bosom in Blame It on Rio, but it later gave her lots of support for films she made a decade afterward, such as Indecent Proposal and Striptease.

Reviewers here on Amazon.com who have blasted the music in Blame It on Rio, in the wrong way, will not be spared my wrath.  When Blame It on Rio first came out, MTV was in its infancy and ""lady"" Madonna was offending the Vatican with her hit song and video, ""Like A Virgin.""  Thanks to her charming displays and those of Prince and his proteges Vanity 6, lingerie sales were soaring a (I can't help it) mile high.  Can anyone spell S-K-I-N?  This was the body-beautiful '80s.  Forget about the good and bad perms, Jheri curls and mullets, which all were the (out)rage.  Derrieres were squeezing themselves into Lycra-Spandex, and ladies were giving the hot shoulder in asymmetrically slouching, torn sweatshirts inspired by a film about a frustrated go-go dancer (Flashdance).  In such a ""Solid Gold"" world, nearly every body-conscious human seemed consumed by lust -- especially the kind between the lyrics and the rhythms of every synthesized-to-the-hilt record. Yes, vinyl was still king (and, even when the needle dragged, queen).

From that aerobicizing mind-set came the American-from-French farce Blame It on Rio.  In the film, there are plenty of neo-disco sounds as well as music from soundalikes of 1980s pop icons such as Michael Jackson, El DeBarge and the dynamic duo of Johnny Mathis-Deniece Williams. If you don't believe me regarding the latter, just listen to the theme ""Blame It on Rio,"" and if you can't recall the theme from the hit show ""Family Ties,"" you're too young to be watching Blame It on Rio, anyway.  And, hey, with the sound clarity of DVD engineering, you can enjoy the synth-pop until your head explodes like the android in Alien.

Amid all the fun in Blame It on Rio, there's a heaping plate of sensuality.  Much of Brazil's homegrown music and dance is well-represented in the film.  Beautiful bossa nova is injected into several memorable scenes: upon the travelers' descent into Rio as the city's sublime landscape unfolds and at a nightclub where a sultry songstress sways to a lilting number while the two middle-aged characters slide further into the alluring prospect of so-many-women-in-so-little-time. While the two fathers are strolling on the beach, bragging (Bologna as ""Victor"") and arguing (Caine as ""Matthew"") about scoring -- fast-tempo Afro-Brazilian rhythms compete with the characters' midlife-critical, anxiety-ridden dialogue.  In this reviewer's opinion, that is pure comedy because despite all the sensual rhythms, bountiful ocean and topless, bikini-waxed babes surrounding them, these dudes are too stiff to go with the flow of life.

I'm surprised that so many reviewers totally overlooked the intentional harmony of music and choreography in this film. Renowned director Stanley Donen was at the helm of Blame It on Rio, after all. View the film again with a critic's eye, and this time pay attention to the beginning of the film, in the first beach scene.  There's a Brazilian song playing, and you see two musicians in swimming trunks who are performing that song -- and so are other musicians on the beach. In fact, almost everyone who's upright on the beach is dancing to that song. What about the amazing performance of capoeira in the open square? I'm referring to the scene in which a guilt-laden and fearful Matthew tries to rid himself of Jennifer (Michelle Johnson) and pass her onto a randy local guy closer to her age. And let's not forget the wonderful dancing and chanting of the Candomble religion at the nighttime wedding reception on the beach. How's all that for Donen magic at work?! It's called choreographic direction, and it's fabulous!

You'll miss the commentary that Blame It on Rio makes about Americans and Brits if you can't get past close-ups of bare breasts.  The title is a strong clue that this movie is tongue-in-cheek, that there will be non-Brazilian characters in the movie who'll act zany and hypersexual (this they do) because they're not only far away from home and having marital trouble, but also they're in a city where they believe they're supposed to act irresponsibly.  As part of the chorus of the title song goes: ""What if we're acting like fools/What do we do?/What do we care?/Blame it on Rio.""

The sexcomedy Blame It on Rio is a vibrant, passionate tribute to human lust -- and a snicker at most of the flaws that accompany it. Like the neon fuschia shade of lipstick I thickly applied throughout the 1980s, this farce is a tantalizing, full-lipped kiss to a footloose decade that will never be repeated again.

1257537,5,B000035P6F,"I read other reviews that, either slated the movie as a waste of time and money, found fault with the DVD picture quality or felt that some of the music was irritating and would have preferred more authentic Brazilian music instead (ala Antonio Carlos Jobim for example) to presumably give the movie more of a 'travelogue' flavor rather than supporting the comedic thrust of this movie. Personally, in a comedy, I don't mind if some of the music is corny. With few exceptions I don't look for great music soundtracks in comedies. Rather than provide another synopsis I'll explain why I recommend this DVD. Michael Caine is perfectly cast and capitalizes on the opportunity to characterize this role with the wit and charm that give practically every film he's in a uniqueness only he can provide. His chemistry with Joseph Bologna (who can portray the archetypal cynic as well as anyone) gives the film enough comic thrust to overlook the somewhat pedestrian performances of some of the other principal actors. In my opinion, Michelle Johnson played her role well and Valerie Harper qualified her relevance to the story but Demi Moore did little to impress. In fairness, that probably had more to do with her role in the story than her characterization. The supporting cast was ideal for the flavor of this film. I think it would be a mistake to install this film in an '80's time capsule, especially with some of the second-rate drivel that's been produced recently. Overall, it's a great movie to look and LAUGH at........and I found nothing wrong with the DVD image.",1105747200,5,1569,4.858208955223881
1257558,4,B000035P6F,"""Blame it on Rio"" is a cute and funny film which manages to be a wish-fulfilment fantasy for middle-aged men, and tell a good story at the same time.
Michael Cane is perfect as the man in a doubful marriage, who is hit on suddenly by his best friend's daughter, Jennifer, played by the voluptous and pretty Michelle Johnson.
Of course that is a doubtful proposition, since he is over twice her age (Michelle was only eighteen when she played this), and since he is vacationing not only with her, but with her father, who is his best friend, and with his own daughter, who is her best friend!
The story is funny and entertaining, and Jennifer is dead sexy. I find it hard to imagine resisting if she threw herself at you.
It must be said that beautiful Demi Moore is underused as Nikki, the best friend. Especially in the underdressed scenes, too little of that. I suspect she was having ego problems against Michelle's bigger bosom. This would explain why she later got a boob job, as seen in (the underrated) Striptease. Very dumb move, in my opinion.

One surprising thing about this movie is that the music in it is pretty nice. It's very reflective of the era, so compard to today's Brazilian music it might sound a little cheezy, but I thought it was pretty refreshing.

1257560,3,B000035P6F,"Title: ""Blame It On Rio""
Released: 1984
Rated: R
Running Time: 1 hour and 40 minutes
Directed by: Stanley Donen
Starring: Michael Caine (Matthew Hollins), Joseph Bologna (Victor Lyons), Michelle Johnson (Jennifer Lyons), Demi Moore (Nicole Hollins), Valerie Harper (Karen Hollins)
  Funny, pleasant remake of the 1977 French film ""One Wild Moment"", stars Caine as middle-aged father figure coping with recent crises in his marriage to Harper while vacationing in Rio de Janeiro with his daughter (Moore) and best friend (Bologna).  Former model Johnson plays Bologna's teen daughter who also is along for the trip.
  Set against the backdrop of near tropical paradise Rio, this movie follows the affair that devlops between Caine and the much younger Johnson after she seduces him.  Caine then spends the rest of the film trying to break it off with the sexy Johnson while attempting to build up nerve to tell the temperamental Bologna before the secret is revealed.
  Caine gives a typically great performance while Johnson, who's acting abilities are limited, more than makes up for her presence by her numerous nude scenes.  Bologna is good as the playboy father who just happens to be going through a divorce himself.  Moore has a limited role and it is obvious from her semi-topless scene on the beach that she had a long way to go before becoming comfortable with these kinds of scenes (i.e. ""Striptease"").  Harper has relatively few scenes but gives a good performance as Caine's strong minded wife.
  This movie was produced and directed by Stanley Donen of ""Singin' In The Rain"" fame.  It was shot on location in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and features a decent soundtrack as well as a catchy (though not overly great) title tune.  The movie is partially narrated by Caine and Johnson a la the narration style in ""When Harry Met Sally"".
  I would recommend this film for those wanting a pleasant diversion for a couple of hours.  Caine fans will also enjoy it as will those wishing to see Johnson bare it all.",1069545600,4,2014,4.908284023668639

Michael Caine's comic timing is, as always, dead on, Michelle Johnson conveys both innocence and teenage hormone-psychosis perfectly, and Joseph Bologna and Valerie Harper are the right combination of buffoonery and bitterness. I think the irreverence and intelligence of the film shows through in the smallest details: the advice of the umbanda woman, the uncommunicative maid, the camera-happy Japanese tourist, the very English Peter and Elaine, etc. With a less sensitive, less intelligent script, this could have been a tawdry tale of illicit love, but instead it is a delicately-crafted farce which perfectly captures the hedonism and sensuality of a cidade maravilhosa, Rio de Janeiro.",1052006400,12,897,5.507246376811594

Michael Caine is at his comic best, with Joe Bologna providing able support as a good friend who could turn very nasty if he finds out Caine has been sleeping with his daughter. Rhoda's Valerie Harper is under-used as Caine's wife, making only brief appearances. The two young stars make a great impression as the uninhibited daughters of Caine and Bologna. Michelle Johnson is outstanding and it is a wonder she didn't go on to become as big a star as Demi Moore.

1257566,4,B000035P6F,"Ok folks, let's just list some pros and cons about this film, shall we?  You didn't really care about the *plot* of the film, did you now?
PROs:
1) Directed by Stanley Donen, who used to do really good films like Charade or Singin' in the Rain.
2) Has some rather lovely scenario throughout, of the human kind and also of the plant kind.  In fact, it remains me of Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (I loved that film as a kid).
3) It's actually a rather funny film, like one of those 1930s screwball comedies or 1950s Cary Grant comedies, albeit with a lot of nudity.  The music sets a nice, light-hearted mood for the film.
4) Michelle Johnson shows us a *couple* of good reasons to watch this film, too! And boy does she show us...
5) Michael Caine, normally a good actor, is also in this film.
6) The DVD itself has a solid transfer of a good source print. It's nice to know the film looks good!
7) Uh, it's an inexpensive DVD.
Cons:
1) Demi Moore is in this film.  Ok, she doesn't show us anything really, so we're just stuck with her acting.  At least she does a decent job in a somewhat thankless role.
2) Michael Caine is in this film.  For a normally good actor, this is one of his more forgettable roles, although he was pretty funny at times, I must admit.
3) Michelle Johnson comes from the Tanya Roberts' school of acting.  I'm not kidding.  She got a Razzy Award for this (worst actress of the year), and it's not hard to see why.  Or hear why, actually.  Every time she opens her mouth, you are reminded that she was obviously not cast for her acting ability.
4) The DVD itself is practically monophonic sound (booo....) and has nothing of significance in the extras (cast info, trailer, that's it really).
5) I've seen this film advertised in stores as ""A gift for Dad!""  Trust me, if you are a daughter, this is NOT the sort of film to buy dear old dad.
6) The storyline, though funny, is somewhat lame (but you didn't really care about the plot, right?).  And the direction makes this look like a second-rate TV movie.  Okay, an HBO TV movie.
Bottom line - Ok, the acting won't win any awards (good awards, that is) and the premise of the film is questionnable (married man has affair with YOUNG daughter of best friend at topless beach), but it is fairly fun and may make you laugh, intentionally or not.  I had a good time watching this film; if you have a couple of hours to spare, why not go ahead and try this film out?",1005523200,4,2435,4.276688453159041

Most of this mess fails to find any laughs and how any characters with any sense of decency could stoop this low.  Of course, this could be a statement about the general lack of morality in Hollywood where a babysitter one day becomes a wife the next.
Valerie Harper and Demi Moore have decent, if undersued roles.  Caine, of course, has gotten much better roles in recent years.  These days though, the only attraction in this movie is to see Michelle Johnson, who is now Michelle Williams, wife of Matt Williams of the World Series winning Arizona Diamondbacks.

1257569,2,B000035P6F,"Drippy for the most part.  One has to blush for Michael Caine who is miscast as a middle aged man who gets seduced by his best friend's daughter while on vacation in Rio De Janeiro.  I had the sense that Brazilian Airlines, or whoever, and the Brazilian tourist bureau fronted the funds for this turkey.  Perhaps some old boys club as well since this is fantasy wish fulfillment for middle-aged men, pure and simple.  This was supposed to be a comedy, a remake of the Claude Berri French film entitled One Wild Moment (1978), but the laughs really don't materialize (there are a few chuckles), and anyway you practically have to be French to make this sort of tale work.  Either that or play it full out as a farce.
Nonetheless, there must have been some reason I kept watching, since I have no desire to see Michael Caine make a fool of himself (in those huge, ugly glasses with the plastic brown frames), and that reason is Michelle Johnson, who does the seducing.  She is very pretty and delightfully sexy and so beguiling that I almost believe her.
But enough about my fantasies.  Joseph Bologna plays the girl's father and Caine's best friend in his usual cynical, wise-cracking style, kind of like the low rent Mafia boss/used car salesman persona that he wears so well.  Demi Moore has a small part as Caine's daughter, but there is no evidence here to account for her becoming a box office star in the nineties.  Valerie Harper plays Caine's wife, who is sick of him and his lack of demonstrativeness and goes on a separate vacation.  Caine's superb timing and great concentration as an actor are in evidence, but somehow he just doesn't quite make it as a poor sap who is torn between lust and propriety.
Stanley Donen (Singing in the Rain (1952), The Pajama Game (1957), Charade (1963), Indiscreet (1958), etc.) directed and was clearly off his best form or past his prime.  Or maybe he just wanted to indulge himself an old guy's daydream.",988243200,5,1950,4.6231884057971016

1257571,5,B000035P6F,"""Blame It On Rio"" is one of my favorite films. The great scenery of Rio De Janeiro is one of the perks of watching this. It's kinda like watching a travelogue of the city that's a 24-hour carnival. The film is  packed with memorable lines as well (""They looked at us, let's go talk  to them,""says Victor. ""They're practically nude,"" Matthew  states. Victor's response? ""Try to picture them with clothes  on""). Michelle Johnson won a Razzie for her performance as Jennifer,  which I didn't think was that bad. Demi Moore's performance, on the other  hand, takes some getting used to. Michael Caine, always the top-rate  performer, doesn't disappoint in this one. His performance is honest and  well-meaning. There are one small fault in the film though: the soundtrack.  I'm not talking about the bossa-nova or nightclub music, but the outdated  80s music. There is one song in the film that gets played over and over  again. By the end of the film, the song will not leave your head LOL. That  doesn't matter though. It doesn't take away the film's entertainment value.  It is still a fun film to watch and make you laugh.",960076800,42,1122,4.721649484536083
1257572,4,B000035P6F,"""Blame It On Rio"" is like taking a great vacation of fun, sun and no inhibitions.  The setting is beautiful Rio de Janeiro and the film gives an honest impression of the city...beautiful beaches, Bossa Nova  flavored music, tropical climate.  Michael Caine is hilarious, Joseph  Bologna a perfect comical foil to Caine, Michelle Johnson sweet and  innocent(?), and Demi Moore likeable and levelheaded.  I saw this movie for  the first time when I was about Michelle Johnson's age and when I saw the  film recently, it brought back wonderful memories of that time in the 80s.  The film is a not-so-implausible plot of a middle-aged man (Caine) spending  a vacation in Brazil with his daughter (Moore),his best friend (Bologna)  and his best friend's daughter (Johnson).  Valerie Harper plays Caine's  wife, who backs out of the vacation to Rio at the last minute and packs for  Bahia.  ""Must have been the free and easy laughter in the air...must  have been the moonlight on the sea..."" Caine has an affair with his  best friend's daughter (Johnson)and the comedy ensues.  ""Blame It On  Rio"" is just plain old fun with great scenery, great quotes (Johnson  to Caine ""That's not you life line, that's your heart line"" and  Caine's reply ""Teeny little thing isn't it""), and great comedy!",955756800,23,1284,4.906542056074766
1257573,4,B000035P6F,"When (1984) I saw BLAME IT ON RIO at the movies I laughed my head off.  Ten years later I rented the videotape and did not crack up as much.  But both times Michael Caine's comic acting abilities impressed me.

For  someone not thought of as a funny-man, Michael Caine's delivered killer  laughs in a number of comedies.  If you like him in BLAME IT ON RIO, seek  out a forgetten comic gem called WITHOUT A CLUE, which is as hilarious as  any flick I've seen.  (One video store displayed it in the Mystery section,  so even some industry people don't know it.)

Father-daughter played by  Joseph Bologna and Michelle Johnson take zany turns going at it with Caine  in BLAME IT ON RIO.  The idea of a teenage girl seducing an adult (her  father's best friend, no less) could upset you, but the actors manage to  make it funny.  See BLAME IT ON RIO, and while you're at it, look for WITHOUT A CLUE.",951350400,7,896,4.333333333333333
1257574,5,B000035P6F,The Woody-Allen-Like segments of the character's reflections on what is happening make this movie even better than just the fact that it has Demi Moore in it. It is funny to see her as a teenager and the rest of the cast  is great. It is beautifully shot and ultimately interesting.,946771200,3,282,4.529411764705882
