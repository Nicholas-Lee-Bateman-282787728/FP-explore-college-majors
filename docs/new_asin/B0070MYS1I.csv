This disc set has more episodes than the US version (25 vs. 16 I believe). I definitely recommend this one if you have a region-free player or plan to watch on your computer.

The packaging and DVD menus do not list what episodes are included, so I am pasting a list for you:

8507798,5,B0070MYS1I,I found out that this DVD set has more episodes than the other Most Shocking Moments DVD.  Being a big soap fan I purchased this one after I found out it's a region 0.  I hope there will be some episodes with Sheila Carter.,1432166400,,223,4.045454545454546
