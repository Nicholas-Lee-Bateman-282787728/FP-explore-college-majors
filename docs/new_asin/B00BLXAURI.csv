8570652,5,B00BLXAURI,"Brick And Mortar And Love was released as a Record Store Day 2013 exclusive, and Im unsure of its current availability but desperately hope that it remains for sale at independent record stores around the world, because this is a documentary that all supporters of music and records and record stores need to see and own and watch. Over the course of 69 minutes, director Shuffitt provides an overview of the life cycle of one of the biggest and most important independent record stores ever, Ear X-tacy in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, via interviews with owner John Timmons, numerous members of the stores loyal staff, and musicians from the local area and beyond  including  My Morning Jacket, The Watson Twins, Wax Fang, and The Kodiaks  who have benefited from in-store performances and healthy sales at Ear X-tacy over the years. To say youll laugh, youll cry, youll feel inspired sounds like a twistedly comedic clich, I know but its true. Sadly  spoiler alert  Ear X-tacy has closed its doors (forever?  I hope not) despite the frantic efforts of the staff, the featured musicians, and concerned members of the community  but, honestly, the poignancy of seeing on film just how devastating it is to lose a place like Ear X-tacy, which always served as a live music venue and a community center as much as it did a place to buy records (and this is true of most independent record stores) makes the point of the film clearer than its director ever could have imagined when filming began: as fans and supporters of music and art and community and life, we need to band together to shop locally and save our independent businesses before they're all gone and were living in a dysfunctional, corporate-controlled psuedo-society like the one in Blade Runner.",1384646400,,1758,4.8595317725752505
8570653,4,B00BLXAURI,"This week - just two days before 2013 Record Store Day - I got TWO new DVDs, both documentaries celebrating independent record shops. One covers the British market while the other focuses on one store in Louisville, KY, while it does include interviews with shop owners in other parts of the US.  Since they are similar, I'm making this a combined review and will post it under both titles. Both have ""release"" dates of April 23rd but should be in independent record stores on April 21st (RSD)
""Last Shop Standing"" (LSS)  is really the ""official DVD"" of Record Store Days 2013 (per the distributor).  A standard version of the 48-minute film is available in the PAL-format (not playable in the US) but has no bonues. The ""Deluxe Edition"" (the one coming on 4/23/13) adds 74 minutes of extras (more on those in a minute).  Based on the book of the same name LSS is a compilation of interview segments with owners of 27 different independent record stores in the UK as well as musicians (who started out as record collectors) like Bi;lly Bragg, Paul Well and Johnny Marr. There are also comments from a former Record Executive with EMI. My favorite shop owners are an elderly couple who have had their shop for over 50 years!.  The film has three chapters: ""The Rise"", ""The Fall"" and ""The Rebirth"". The 48 minutes seem to drag at some points when many of the interviews seem to sound alike but I still enjoyed it.

The bonuses include the 4 1/2 -minute """"Rebirth Continued"" which was filmed after the film was released and spends most of the time with a guy who created a coffee shop/record store named ""Pie & Vinyl"" to keep his operation going. The 6-minute ""Shop Talk"" has some funny stories about customers. The balance consists of extended interviews (6 to 12 minutes) with Weller (The Jam, Style Council), Bragg and some others and 25-minute interview with Marr (Morrissey, The Smiths). I actually found these more interesting than many of the interviews in the basic film.

The other DVD - ""Brick and Mortar and Love"" - focuses on the ""ear X-tacy Records"" shop in Louisville, which was in business for over 25 years. It was a Louisville institution and drew a wide variety of ""recorded music"" buyers. It featured in store appearances by local bands - some, like My Morning Jacket"" went on to become famous but came back to play in the shop to support them. Director Scott Shuffit follows owner John Timmons as he opens - and then moves- his store location, trying to compete with the ""big box store"" chains. (Downloaded music is mentioned as a threat to small record stores but, surprisingly, on line merchants are not.) We hear comments from managers of other large independent stores like Amoeba Records in California and Grimey's in Nashville. Even though the film is only 69 minutes long, it seemed to repeat itself a bit too often. Jim James fans will enjoy seeing the My Morning Jacket lead sing briefly at the beginning and the end but, generally, there is little music on the soundtrack or on screen. It's obviously in the ""grooves"" of the vinyl records that stock the store. I can recommend this to supporters of independent stores too see what it's like behind the scenes.

Both of these DVDs should be for sale at your local independent record shop and - while I think Amazon provides easy access to purchasing, you might want to try those shops first. After all - as we see in both of these - their number is shrinking.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
