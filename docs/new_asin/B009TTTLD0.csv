5368299,5,B009TTTLD0,Joan Rivers is one of my all-time favorite comedians and this special is no exception. She is incredibly witty and hysterically funny.,1363651200,,134,5.136363636363637
5368300,5,B009TTTLD0,"She is funny as hell, still. A semi-legend in her own time.
buy or rent this movie, its a keeper",1361923200,5,96,3.85
5368301,5,B009TTTLD0,"Joan Rivers never fails to entertain and insult to the max......she's really an equal opportunity insulter.  Despite her having one of the biggest hearts in showbiz today, the stand up routine that she performs is simply top shelf.............full of energy and spirit, Joan has left no stone unturned with her brash, direct and no apology form of comedy. She can be brutal, but never fails to make us all laugh.  I can't say enough about this 79 year old wonder......bright, energetic, crude, direct,and often ""right on the money"" describe this full of life comedian.

In short, I LOVED this routine and moreso, I love the woman who delivered it.

5368304,5,B009TTTLD0,Joan is so funny. She covers a lot of territory and doesn't miss anyone! I would recommend this DVD to anyone with a funny bone.,1361145600,,128,4.16
5368305,3,B009TTTLD0,"Hello: I just bought this dvd of Joan Rivers:""Don't get me started"". It is very funny. My wife and I first heard this broadcast on HBO,and enjoyed it so much,we decided to purchase it. The dvd is clear and very well recorded.  The problem is that when we heard this on T.V. several months ago Joan Rivers' voice was projected clearly so you could understand her very funny comments,but on this dvd which is sold to the public the audience applause and laughing seem to over power Ms. Rivers. You raise the volume to hear her and then the people laugh so loud that you immediately lower the volume. Then Joan River talks again and you can't hear her so you raise the volume very loud and the audience again laughs and laughs so loud -you lower the volume again and again. I believe that Joan Rivers needed to wear a second microphone when she recorded this tape instead of a microphone in the air  or in the audience. It is to much combined mixing of both the laughing and her constant very funny statements. She is a very very funny women and I think the audio engineers working to produce this dvd should have had seperation in the recording of her on stage.",1358985600,18,1159,4.411214953271028
5368306,2,B009TTTLD0,"Joan Rivers wrote a new book last year which was funny. Lots of white space and a story to offend nearly everyone. But- if you know what you are getting in for, it can be enjoyable. For years Rivers built her routine around her late husband Edgar. Sure she used four letter words but the point of her humor was actually funny.

Now approaching 80 years old, Rivers is going for shock humor. Not even insult humor like Don Rickels is known for. Not only does she consider herself an ""equal opportunity offender"" but, based on this 69 minute performance at a theater in St. Charles, Illinois, -a theater with her name emblazoned all over the walls - she presents herself as so horny that she needs sex all the time.

After telling jokes to offend, old people (herself excluded of course), Africans-Americans, Asians and lesbians (she does love gay men and - from the reaction and audience shots - with only men in the first two rows - this is now a prime audience for her) she talks female body parts. Trust me; this is more verabally graphic than a discussion with a gynecologist.

When it looks like she cannot go any deeper into trying to offend someone, Rivers stoops as low as possible when she tries to make fun of - what else? - the holocaust. (No not the way Mel Brooks does it. In fact, even this audience reacts in silence when she gets this low.)

I like funny comedians - and comediennes - and can certainly take strong language (nearly every phrase from Rivers mouth contains a word beginning with the letter F), though it shouldn't be requisite, but I found little to laugh here.
There are already two reviews (giving 5 stars to this DVD) here before me., including fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris, who I generally agree with. My rating is based on the laughter - or, rather lack of it - that I found watching this and sometimes embarrassment I felt for Rivers, having to stoop as low as she does here. So if you are a true Rivers fan, you'll probably like it, but be aware that the language is graphic and the humor is mean spirited.

Note that there are no special features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I've read her books and watched her on the Red Carpet and Fashion Police.  She says what we don't dare.  It's funny because we have had some of the same thoughts, but didn't express them.  Beneath that outspoken rude and crude veneer she exhibits, is a soft hearted woman.  She says she is not charitable, but she was a great philanthropist.  Rest in Peace Joan.

5368328,5,B009TTTLD0,"The late great Joan Rivers really tears it up onstage in this stand-up comedy special from Chicago (the place she began with Second City). As with many comedians, Joan is in her element onstage, armed with her signature sharp tongue and no rating. She trashes every person & subject she can in 69 minutes with her ""if you don't like it, there's the door"" attitude. Folks not used to Joan's volatile style will most likely be taken back; she's potently filthy & swears like a sailor. But she's very good, and surprisingly, quite physical for a woman of 78. No wonder she influenced so many future comediennes with her incomparable comedy. She just puts it all out there.
While Joan was never my favorite, you have to admit that she had plenty of guts to do what she did, onstage and in TV & films. Thank you, Miss Rivers. You made our lives more colorful...and fun!",1417046400,,864,4.544871794871795

5368373,5,B009TTTLD0,"Can we talk?!  How is it that she just had her seventy eighth birthday and has more energy by far than any twenty year old I have ever encountered.  Either she is high shooting speed or running on energized batteries.  Firstly, she is funny as freaking hell and secondly her comedic timing and the way in which she has so much absolute fun on stage is inspiring beyond words.  And it is also under the extenuating circumstances, incredibly sad.  Eighty one is just a number and for someone else they maybe will even be elderly.  Joan has said to Melissa when she dies nobody will say ""so young"".  In her case though I do say just that.  Young and vibrant, hysterically funny and full of life.  I hugely recommend this video to anyone who is not easily offended because there are no holds barred and that is why we love her!!  I JUST WATCHED THIS AGAIN WITH A GLASS OF (ORGANIC)WINE; i CANNOT STAND THE FACT THAT JOAN RIVERS IS NOT ALIVE; NOBODY IS FUNNY IN THIS EXTREME; SO I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THE WINE YOU KNOW AND RIGHT ACROSS FROM ME IS A FREAKING ROACH STARING STRAIGHT AT ME AND I AM THINK JOAN IS DEAD AND THIS INSECT IS ALIVE.

5368386,4,B009TTTLD0,"joan rivers is very funny. i have enjoyed her every time i've seen her and i've watched most of her shows.  her wit is rapier like.  i liked the front half of the show a bit better than the back half.  in the front half she insults everyone for the groups they belong to her audience, everyone from handicapped, to blind to too thin.  this was all great.  the sexual stuff is n the back half.  it does not offend me but i am getting tired of the same old, same old.  there is not a heck of a lot new on this subject and making it dirtier doesn't make it better. lately i have found myself enjoying the comedians more who find universals in life and draw the comedic sides of those for laughs.  one new comic i recently discovered, mike birbiglia, does exactly that.  he sleepwalks and i love his comedy on that problem.

i do enjoy rivers on joan and melissa and fashion police so i am a fan, just not her biggest one.  this standup set is a funny show and a good evening's entertainment.

Sound quality here is so poor, I had to use CC to understand most of the jokes (Im young and not hard of hearing). Also, the jokes themselves are just funnier.
