8193056,2,B000PSISPG,The speaker is monotone and repeats herself numerous times to get her point across.  It was boring and contained very basic information. I expected more after reading the other reviews.,1346198400,,185,5.166666666666667
8193057,1,B000PSISPG,The sound quality is off and somewhat distorted. The instruction was the worst I've had in thirty or more videos. I feel cheated. I read the reviews and thought I was getting something worthwhile.,1344988800,,196,4.794117647058823
8193058,5,B000PSISPG,A great addition to my library.  A book I will repeatedly use and refer to --- at a great price.  Thank you Amazon.,1316563200,,115,3.9565217391304346
8193059,5,B000PSISPG,"Wish Amazon carried all of her DVDs, they are not only affordable, but fantastic instruction. How generous of the artist to share so much for so little a cost. I thank her from my heart. Now I have hope in becoming my own artist.",1312329600,5,229,4.2272727272727275
8193060,5,B000PSISPG,"This watercolor instructional is by Taylor Bush.  I don't know why her name is not on it. Also, I've reviewed her dvds before but my reviews are no longer here.  Very strange.

I've never met Ms. Bush, but her dvds are wonderful and I want her to get credit for them.

She also offers a video called Clay Pots.  I own both of these.  If you love watercolor, you will love her dvd's.  The focus is on the painting, always.  You see very little of Ms. Bush, but are invited to watch, close-up, as she paints and does a wonderful non-intrusive narration.  It's a very good way to really see what an artist does.  She explains it all as she goes.

There is a bonus dvd with it - All the Pretty Colors - that really tells you about colors, pigments, mixing, etc.

I recommend all three of the DVDs by Taylor Bush -

8193061,5,B000PSISPG,"This DVD goes into great detail and can be just a little confusing for a beginner but keep watching as the lessons are quite valuable.  The instructor's voice is soothing and cheerful.  The work she does is beautiful and inspiring.  You won't be disappointed with this DVD.  It is very professionally produced.  This is a ""keeper"".",1218067200,21,331,4.839285714285714
