955100,5,6305063745,"This is not Record of Lodoss War.  Enjoy the movie at face value.  Many people say the animation is of poor quality, when I think the animation is equal if not better than Lodoss War.  The drawing style, however, is  bar-none best in Lodoss.  If you're a fanatic of Lodoss War, you should  like this expansion and other view of the mystical world that is Lodoss.",961977600,4,362,4.409090909090909
955101,5,6305063745,"Legend of Crystania is a fantastic flight into a world of spells and sword play.  It all takes place on an island, separate from the rest of the world.  Animal gods rule, and their subjects can take on the form of the  animal god whom they worship.  A young prince and his companions are forced  from their land, seeking refuge on the island of Crystania.  They fight for  their survival while trying to unravel the great mystery of this land.

955102,1,6305063745,"I bought this video in hopes of finding a good sequel to one of my favorite animes of all time: Record of Lodoss War.  Not only did the animation look like it had been washed out by the rain, but the plot was  definitely in need of something.  If you are a die-hard Lodoss fan, like I  am, it might spark a tiny flare of interest even after you've seen its  horrible plot, but if you're just a normal anime-goer, STAY AWAY!  This is  an insult to the original series.",955929600,4,467,4.122222222222222
955103,3,6305063745,"Actually I always and still want to buy Record of Lodoss War, but because in Germany they didn't have the English Version I discovered Legend of Crystania and thought it might be a good replacement for Lodoss War. But  no, instead we got this flop. I was very disappointed in this movie. I mean  I've read some Fantasy stories myself and found most of them very, very  suspenseful and exciting.  What disappoints me most is the animation of the  characters. Just look at the colors; almost lifeless and without emotion.  Okay, the plot for a fantasy is quite okay, but not as suspenseful as I  have hoped for.  You can be lucky that I'm a reasonable person, otherwise  I'd give this movie only 2 stars.",955065600,3,702,4.552
955104,2,6305063745,"Although the music is pretty decent, the voice-acting fair, and the story interesting, the Legend of Crystania simply isn't worth it.  Record of Lodoss War was fantastic, and Crystania simply doesn't earn the title of  'sequel' for Lodoss.  The animation was poor (Lodoss' animation may not  have been fantastic [ie the dragons] but it was still great), the shading /  color scheme was terrible, and the story did get rather dull at times.  It's as if they were trying to leech off Lodoss' fame to bring in a few  quick bucks.",951264000,5,526,4.714285714285714
955105,4,6305063745,"This off-shoot (Not to be confused with Cronicles of the Heroic Knight) of Loddoss Wars takes place way after.  If you haven't seen Loddess, you can still enjoy this well made film.  It tell the story of a ruler who wants to  protect his people and take them to the nearly unreachable kingdom of  Crystania.  Needless to say, this stts off the adventure of a small band on  a quest not soon forgotten.  This is indeed, one for the collection.",951091200,,442,4.45
955106,3,6305063745,"This anime is perhaps best thought of as an expansion video for Lodoss war. The reason being that there are some instances where knowledge of the previous series would clarify plot points. The animation is not as smooth as  Manga although the musical score and the voice casting are good. The video  has the typical fantasy setting of an ancient world mixed with monsters and  powerful gods. Crystania is a competent anime with interesting pale drawing  techniques(A faded cell animation), and a decent plot. Although not up to  the standard of Lodoss War, crystania makes a decent purchase given that it  has no overtly bad points. It also works well as a stand alone animation  which means that viewing the previous series is recommended but not  necessary",950659200,6,758,4.913385826771654
955107,4,6305063745,"A simple story of a battle between good and evil, pits young prince Radon against shape-changing adversaries in a far off land. Being written by Ryo Mizuno, you can expect a lot of bright visuals and fine acting (though  almost every single word is screamed or shouted), though at times it is a  bit intense for the younger kids it is aimed at.",947548800,,344,4.444444444444445
955108,2,6305063745,"I was very disappointed in this video, as it was represented as a follow up to Lodoss Wars.  The art is only okay and the coloring pastel, much like the personalities of the characters.  The only two characters continuing  from Lodoss are unrecognizable and are not in leading roles.  I'm sure I'd  have liked this better if they'd left it to its own merits and not tried  the flimsy tie in to Lodoss Wars.",942969600,2,406,4.418918918918919

If you're into anime, go ahead and buy this motion picture.  You won't be disappointed.  ;)",1041984000,3,362,4.619047619047619
955211,4,6305063745,"I found none of the previous reviews deal with this movie.  They all refer back to Legend of Crystania - The Movie.  This is the sequel to that movie. I had to do a bit of research on the internet prior to buying it as I already had the movie.  If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy this, as it is better.  The story is not of the depth or scope of the Lodoss DVDs.  It, however, has very good animation, no still pictures charging into battle as in Lodoss.  The voice acting suffers a bit from overly hormonal actors, which seems to plague the English voice tracks in anime.  Overall I enjoyed it and gave it 4 stars only because, I gave Lodoss 5 and it is not that good.",1034467200,6,675,4.068181818181818
955212,2,6305063745,"(UPDATE: I wrote this review for Legend of Crystania, the MOTION PICTURE, but apparently Amazon displays this review also for THE CHAOS RING.  If you're looking for a CHAOS RING review, please skip this)

As a bit of background info, in RECORD OF LODOSS WAR: CHRONICLES OF THE HEROIC KNIGHT, Ashram and Pirotess leave the island of Lodoss and set out on their own, and in LEGEND OF CRYSTANIA: THE MOTION PICTURE, you can see what became of them.

However, the animation style of LEGEND OF CRYSTANIA: THE MOTION PICTURE is rather plain and does not even attempt to match the character style and animation set forth in the Lodoss OVA or TV series.  The overall plot is rather mediocre and focuses on a completely new set of characters.  Ashram and Pirotess are really only marginally involved in the plot, which makes it an even bigger disappointment, as they are the sole tie to the rest of the Lodoss universe (and my only reason for buying/watching CRYSTANIA).

If you haven't seen this, you aren't missing much.  If you want more Lodoss, go watch RECORD OF LODOSS WAR: CHRONICLES OF THE HEROIC KNIGHT instead.

However, if you're a Lodoss completist, you might want to check it out, just for the sake of finding out what happened to Ashram and Pirotess.

The bottom line is, don't expect too much from CRYSTANIA if you're coming to it as a Lodoss fan.",1008806400,4,1353,4.651260504201681
955213,2,6305063745,"Though I was giving it the benefit of the doubt, Legend of Crystania proved to be quite a disappointment.  The story line is less than underdeveloped.  In the short length of less than 1.5 hours, there isn't much time to make good story plot, but they managed to put forth very little effort.  I was pretty disappointed about the fact that they even have a BIO section for all of the characters and state that Ashram and Pirotess are the same people from lodoss war, but act/look nothing like themselves.  I have not yet seen the series, but i might imagine it to be a little bit better due to fewer time constraints... but I won't get my hopes up quite yet.",998524800,3,658,4.368852459016393
955214,4,6305063745,"Many reviewers seem disappointed that this story deviates completely from the original Record of Lodoss Wars saga.  In my opinion, the fact that Crystania is a completely new saga unto itself is a plus and not a minus.  The only characters that appear from Lodoss Wars are Ashram and Pirotesse, and there is no real relation to the old story except for Pirotesse's devotion to Ashram.  What is similar to the Lodoss Wars saga are the character types-knight, wizard, cleric, fighter, etc.  Crystania is a totally new fantasy realm in itself where different regions are ruled by animal gods, and the followers shape-shift to take on the animal forms of their various gods.  The story is intricate and well-developed, and draws you in, especially at the climax.  The movie is great to watch by itself in that it ends with a satisfying conclusion, but it also leaves some loose ends to be resolved in the other three tapes in the series, which I also highly recommend.  The only negative to the Crystania movie and series is that the animation is poorly drawn for the most part.  At times (such as during the climax) the animation becomes much more detailed and is beautifully done, but most of the time you will notice the lack of detail.  All in all, if you are looking for an original fantasy epic with a great story, I highly recommend Legend of Crystania!",987033600,,1356,4.687763713080169
955215,3,6305063745,"As has been said by previous reviewers, Legend of Crystania is not a sequel to Record of Lodoss Wars, although it appears to bill itself as such.  While the names of Lord Ashrom and the dark elf Pirotess are employed, and the hero bears a striking resemblance to Parn of RLW, that is where the similarities end.
The animation is average at best.  The voice acting is somewhere between indifferent and poor, and the character depictions flat terrible.  The dark elf acts nothing like any dark elf I've ever seen or read about.  Another character is apparently meant to be a berserker, but is only a pale shadow of what he could or should be.
All these problems notwithstanding, the story somehow holds together and manages to retain the viewer's interest.  By the end, you may actually find yourself hoping that Ashrom and Pirotess at last have a chance for mutual happiness.  Weak as it is, Legend of Crystania does work.
If you approach this DVD hoping it will be a continuation of the Lodoss War saga, you will be disappointed.  However, if you can set that preconception aside and accept Legend of Crystania as a sword and sorcery tale entirely its own, you may find it a surprisingly satisfying story.
Recommended, but just barely.",974937600,16,1235,4.716279069767442
955216,1,6305063745,"If you're a Lodoss War fan, avoid this title. Despite it's billing, it has no tie-in with the Lodoss world besides a 2 minute history intro and a couple of names thrown out at the very beginning.
Beyond that, the story is indifferent, and the animation is poor. It has none of the sharp style and bright contrasts that typically makes for good anime, coming across blurry and dull instead (and that goes for both the animation AND the story!).
Imagine that someone took a water-color version of the Lodoss War, erased the story, and then left it out in the rain overnight. This is what you'd have left. Go see the original again, or try the 'Chronicles of the Heroic Knight' (now out on DVD). Give this one a miss.",972432000,2,714,4.458015267175573
955217,1,6305063745,"OK. I admit it. I've fallen asleep when trying to watch this thing -- twice. I can't believe that Kadokawa Shoten and Group SNE, who also  produced Lodoss To Senki, would allow the use of such obvious  ""similarities."" Worse, I can't believe that the original story is  by Mizuno Ryo (also did Lodoss to Senki). Let's see if I've got the  ""plot"" right: 300 years ago, Ashram, Pirotess and their fleet are  dead in the water, when a mysterious god drops an island on their laps.  Move forward to ""present-day,"" when our young hero, Leydo (who  bears an uncanny resemblance to Parn), finds himself on the run after his  father and mother are killed by the army. Their accursed island  (Alecrast? ) is surrounded by vasts oceans and a insurmountable wall.  Backed against a wall (literally), a mysterious voice invites Leydo and his  party into the mysterious lands - Crystania.
I'm still not sure what the  story is supposed to be about. Balbas has been playing puppeteer, but we're  not really sure why. Why is Adelicia in the party? Why does Leydo save  Ryo's life? Why has it taken Priotess 300 years to be able to try to free  Ashram? And why does Leydo's horse jump a ridiculous distance (on its own  accord, no less!) to get Leydo and Priotess into the grounds? Better still,  how did the two survive? Lots of questions, no answers. I sniffed trouble  from the very opening scenes -- a live shot of a gaming convention, which  then fades to a table around which sit a party dressed in fantasy costume,  all staring at an over-exposed dining room lamp. This has got to be the  worst show I've ever watched -- er, tried to watch. There's no real story,  and there's no real flow. Characters are thrown into the script  indescriminately, as if some poor dungeon master in an RPG started getting  more players joining his dungeon quest. Animation quality is mixed --  surprisingly realistic in some scenes, Saturday-morning cartoon quality in  others. (I wonder if there's a stock footage library of anim?) Background  music and opening themes are thankfully non-descript, as is the acting,  with the exception of Leydo (try to imagine a male version of Noriko from  GunBuster. Only Leydo will start bawling at the drop of a hat, kill half a  dozen swamp creatures, and then start bawling all over again.) The final  scene when Balbas' influence over Ashram's body is held in check, and  Pirotess has to kill Ashram with his own sword was inspired by the Eveready  Energizer commericals: it goes on, and on, and on... If this ever gets  dubbed in English, I hope it's totally re-written. In the meantime, there  are apparently two more installments...",965779200,,2650,4.724288840262582
955218,2,6305063745,"Ok...if you are looking for a sequel to Lodoss War, then this is not where you wanna go. It's nothing like Lodoss War, and you only have Ashram and Pirotesse returning from the original.  But even putting that aside, it  wasn't that great of a movie.  First off, it was a good deal bloodier than  Lodoss War was, so if you're squemish, don't bother.  Secondly, a lot of  parts of the movie, even though I tried and tried to make sense of them, I  could not.  It was not very well written, and from beginning to end, just  made little sense.  Don't get me wrong; it wasn't entirely bad, but it was  more bad than good.  I say don't waste your money.",964915200,,648,4.221311475409836

7881434,2,6305063745,"This story takes place long after the Lodoss series. Ashram leads the Marmo to a new home and makes a deal with a god spirit to save them. He is possessed by the spirit and becomes an evil tyrannical ruler.

This series disappointed the heck out of me. The only character that you will recognize from Lodoss is Pirotess. Her appearance and attitude are completely different. She may as well be a different character all together. The animation is not that good and the voice actors are awful. The whole premise and story are not bad though; but the bottom line is I don't think you should spend money on this anime.",1350518400,,615,4.491071428571429
7881435,4,6305063745,"This review is coming from someone who came to this video independently and knows nothing of the Lodoss Wars.

I can tell the difference between the DVD and the VHS versions because it's a video very dear to me for no other reason than I watched and enjoyed it as a child. This will sound odd, but the VHS version is superior to the DVD version, and it's because of the difference in sound quality. The VHS version has full sound, with voice and sound effects equally balanced. The DVD, on the other hand, has poor sound mixing. If you watch the movie in English, you get great voice acting but weak sound effects. If you watch it in Japanese, you get horrendous voice acting but great sound effects.

If you're not picky, the DVD is the way to go.",1260230400,,748,4.335714285714285
7881436,4,6305063745,"Legend of Crystania: The Chaos Ring is a story in the Record of Lodoss War universe, with one of the two protagonists being Cheru (aka Pirotess), the loyal servant (maybe even lover) of Lord Ashram, one of the main villains in the original Record of Lodoss War series. While at first confusing, with the characters living in a world where Ashram and Beld (the main villains in the original Record of Lodoss War) are revered as heroes, the plot eventually smooths out (near the end of the second episode). Cheru's motives are not at first clear and Barbas (the evil god king) at some points looks identical to Ashram (a good guy). Lastly, the fact that all of the characters are in Crystania does not become clear till later on, which also adds to the confusion.

Besides the confusion at times (which is probably the fault of the English translation from Japanese)the voice actors are great and the animation is AMAZING!! The characters are also unique and very well-drawn. The combat scenes are beautiful, with very detailed and realisitc movements.

Originally expecting it to be a movie, I found after I purchased it that it was actually divided into three episodes, which was fine with me--the opening tune is pretty catchy, with the sequence sporting a beautiful combat sequence between Cheru and a dragon.

Overall, this is a great buy though I give it a 4 out of 5 because of the confusion factor. I did not, however, watch the Legend of Crystania movie, which I think precedes this series--this could be the reason I was confused. I will be watching the movie in the near future and may end up switching my rating to 5 out of 5.",1175904000,5,1636,4.653979238754325
7881437,5,6305063745,"i thought at first i should try with this anime and i never expected to be such a great fun anime to watch :D im so glad that i bought it , this anime is way better and much more funnier than loddoss war :D",1175472000,,206,3.6
7881438,4,6305063745,"Legend of Crystania.....where should I begin? I'm not really sure...

If you are a fan of Lodoss, this will probably appeal to you. It has a few familiar characters, such as Pirotess and Ashram. But don't expect this to be Lodoss. Though there are some similarities, this is different. The plot isn't bad, but parts are a bit hard to follow. Maybe if there had been more episodes, more material could have been covered, and more explained. Even so, you can follow it, and Legend of Crystania keeps you entertained.

The animation isn't bad. The characters (Pirotess and Ashram) look different, but I thought that was good, so that you're able to keep it separate from Lodoss. For the most part the animation looks very good.

The music threw me a bit. It tended to be a bit jazz-y and I didn't expect that. But it wasn't bad.

The ending was....well.....I don't want to spoil it, but I was a little disappointed. That's why I give it 3 1/2 instead of 4 stars. Don't get me wrong, there was really nothing wrong with it, it wraps up the major plot points fairly well, and it was more satisfying than some anime I've seen, but it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.

All in all, I'd recommend it. You might want to rent it first, I can see how some would be upset with themselves for spending the money on it. However, I'm not. I'm glad I bought it. To me, it's like a Lodoss fanfiction. Interesting to look at, but ultimately just not part of the story, if you can understand that. And if you watch this with a mindset like that, you'll probably like it a lot.",1168300800,2,1561,4.387543252595155
7881439,1,6305063745,"But let us be perfectly honest.  What made Records of Lodoss Wars so great was it was a classic Fantasy with a few kinks thrown in and AMAZING art.  Legends of Crystania has...shall we say...lazy art, terrible dubbing and, worst of all, little of the lore that made Lodoss work.

And again, we need to look at this in a harsh light!  How does Legend of Crystania compare to other anime?  Anime worth 5 stars is like Akira and Cowboy Bebop...truly masterfull peices of work.  Can you honestly say this movie compares well with these titles?  I am going to go out on a limb and say even the great Lodoss, as good as it was, does not compare well with Cowboy Bebop.  We, as reviewers, need to not inflate scores of these films.  Even if you liked this movie, you have to admit it doesn't hold a candle to great anime.",1100563200,,814,4.302631578947368
7881440,3,6305063745,"Down to the point, Legend of Crystania isn't a complete flop. Truthfully, the story could have been very good and captivating. It however isn't back to the old loved style of Record of Lodoss War. The animation can look wonderful at times, but usually lacks color and has very thick, black lines for details. As for the story, it seems a bit rushed and lacks depth in character. The main characters don't have real personalities and thus, you don't get attached to them. The story is pretty good, but it takes time and effort to figure out the whole story. After watching it, you feel empty, and the story just doesn't make since, like bits and pieces were left out. It does add a bit more to the Lodoss Saga and is worth you time at least. So all in all, Legend of Crystania isn't great due to rushed story and very unrealistic characters... But before you just blow it off, you should at least rent it and see it for yourself.",1075334400,5,928,4.401162790697675
