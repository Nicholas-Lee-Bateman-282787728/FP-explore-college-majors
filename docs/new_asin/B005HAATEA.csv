  Ian McShane was just sensational as Gem Sallon owner Al Swearingen.

 And the rest of the cast was awesome too.  I have heard they are starting production this fall 2018 for a Return to Deadwood.

8472795,5,B005HAATEA,"So, I must confess: I am a ""Deadwood"" junkie. I have purchased the complete series, and with each view, I look forward to spending time with these bigger then life characters based on the gritty mining camp of Deadwood(Don't call or come over between 10 and 11 PM, I will not answer the phone or door!). I even love sitting through the opening title sequence each and every time.

Legendary characters Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and others(Bullock, Swearengen, etc.) of the mining camp, mix in with some fictional characters who are some pretty gritty and most often lecherous people. They speak like they were brought up on the King's English, but may also set a new record for the most swear words in any program. There is also quite a bit of sex, nudity and violence. And although all of that only add to the ""ambiance"" of the setting, it is certainly not one for the kiddies or anyone who cringes at 4 letter(and longer) words.

There are 12 delicious episodes in this first season to savour. Here is a little about the opening of the series, from there I was completely hooked.
Episode 1: ""Deadwood""
""No law at all in Deadwood...is that true?""
This of course, is the episode that will introduce you and hook you on all the fun and the characters that grow throughout the series and grow on you. It will be hard to chose a favorite. They are all shall we say ""charismatic"" in their own special way...
Ex Montana Marshall Bullock has rolled into town with business partner Sol Star. They open a hardware business for the miners of the camp. It isn't long before Bullock meets up with the legendary Wild Bill Hickok, and also is at odds with the owner of the ""Gem"" saloon, the formidable Al ""pardon my French"" Swearengen. Swearengen seems to be the Godfather of the the camp. He has his finger in every pie; and nobody seems to make a move without his approval. Al may at first rub you the wrong way with his crude style, but I have to say, that he has become my absolute favorite of the series.

The muddy midway of Deadwood comes alive in this very real series. The cast of the series is marvelous. Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, Molly Parker, Jim Beaver, Brad Dourif, William Sanderson, Powers Boothe, and Keith Carradine(Wild Bill), will all draw you in immediately. The music is so good I bought the Season 1 soundtrack that mixes short quotes from the series(also explicit) with some western style music and some great blues. Each episode runs about 50 minutes.

My 5 stars rating is for the entire series, each and every episode. There are 6 discs total(in season 1), 5 with the episodes and one bonus feature disc. By the way the clarity of the picture is excellent and the sounds of the Old West will come alive in your living room.

This series is also available for sale by the entire series or individual episodes(usually 2- 3 episodes per disc). Surf around for best deal. Check out this great series..be careful though, it's addicting!

Saddle Up for one heck of a ride and...""A Hell of a Place to Make Your Fortune"".
