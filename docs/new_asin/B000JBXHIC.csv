8149378,4,B000JBXHIC,"This series is missing the Australian episodes.  It is not complete at all.  It says it is unabridged but that is not true.  I wrote a letter to A&E about the missing Benny Hill episodes and they sent me back the wrong form letter about missing Monty Python episodes.  Therefore, I doubt this problem will be fixed.

Besides the episode missing and the obviously incorrect claim it is unabridged, it is the best compilation to date.",1225065600,2,432,4.631578947368421
8149379,5,B000JBXHIC,"If you are a fan of Benny Hill, and watched his shows in the 70's and 80's, this collection is a must!  The clairity is amazing, like it was filmed yesterday.  Benny is the master -- his ability to communicate so much without saying a word is his signature.  For some reason volume 6 is not inculded, and must be purchased separately.",1171152000,2,334,4.354838709677419
