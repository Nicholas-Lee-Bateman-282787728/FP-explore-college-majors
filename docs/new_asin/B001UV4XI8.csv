3804562,3,B001UV4XI8,"Ok looks like I'm the first one to write a review. :D I just saw it in the midnight showing. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it in 3D because some dimwit decided to get the plain imax instead of 3d but whatever. Now to the movie. The part with harry seeing the dursley's off was not in the movie. Amazing, since that's one of the funniest parts of the book. I love seeing harry stand up to the dursleys. :D Um . . . I guess it wasn't too bad. They showed the part with the locket being destroyed and it was done fairly well. I couldn't believe that they got the actual dialogue from the book right because when they are converting it into script they for some reason think it's great to change the dialogue in a part that they show that's actually right. Not only did they get the dialogue right, but they got it in the right order! Amazing. lol.
  As for the graphics, they were AMAZING! I loved how they made everything look so real, and made sure that the effects were utilized to their fullest potential. I think my favorite scene with the graphics would have to be the locket, and godricks hollow. Both were amazing.
  I really liked that they added hermione's parents to the mix, showing what everyone was doing to prepare to search for horcruxes and such. It put a whole new level of feeling to the whole production. So cutos to those of you who made the movie.
  While there are good things to say about the movie, of course there are bad things.
  I couldn't believe what I saw at the ministry! I was so mad because when they used the poly juice potion, they became the same people that they plucked hairs from, but they totally screwed it up. Ron goes to derain yaxley's office, that was right, hermione went to the court rooms, and harry went to see umbridges office, but harry didn't take the eye, ron went with him to get hermione, and they all started changing back to themselves right in the middle of the ministry and NO ONE NOTICED! HARRY POTTER IS THE MOST WANTED WIZARD AT THE TIME AND NO ONE NOTICED! IN THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC NO LESS! Can you believe that? I think not.
  They never use the invisibility cloak in the movie. Not once. And the only time they show them using the poly juice potion is in the ministery which as all of us potterfans know,  they used in godricks hollow and when they went into gringotts. Oh and we all know that everywhere they went they used the invisibility cloak in case something went wrong.
  Oh and instead of disapperating everywhere, they WALKED everywhere! Can you believe that?
  Oh and going back to the beginning, you know voldemort's name is taboo, well they didn't even say it and the deatheater's came. They weren't on tottenham court road. They were in some other place apparently. Oh well.
  Maybe it's just because I love the harry potter books that I find all these flaws, but I won't spend all night writing them out because there are a lot and you probably don't want to read a review that long with flaws in the movie.
  I will say this though . . . if you haven't read the books, it might be a little harder to follow than if you had. I had trouble understanding what the hell I was seeing when I was watching what harry was seeing when he went into voldemort's mind. And they happen so fast . . . you barely have time to register what you're seeing.
  I was a little disappointed with this movie, although it is way better than David Yate's tragic failure at producing a good adaption of Harry potter and the order of the pheonix. It was the worst thing they ever could have done to a harry potter book as good as that. Took him three movies to even start getting better at directing them. Shame.
  Okay and for all you people who have read this review when I first wrote it, I want to point out that I think this movie was the best adaption by far than the fifth harry potter movie to which I am no fan of. I loved some of the scenes that they had and I loved the fact that they managed not to cut out the most important scenes although I really would have liked to see dedalus diggle and hestia jones. I loved the movie, I am just pointing out things that could cause a problem later. The only real main concern I have is them not using the invisibility cloak because it becomes a big part of the movie later. I mean, it's common sense people, harry potter (the most wanted wizard in the world) is not going to be striding up the street without some sort of concealment where deatheaters are looking for them. Ok? So please, no negative criticizms on the comments? I am merely stating fact. While I give negative feedback, I also give positive, so try to focus on both parts, not just negative. Thank you.",1290124800,9,4681,4.300341296928328
3804563,4,B001UV4XI8,"The decision to split the final of J.K. Rowling's novels into two films was a wise one, for it allows for the inclusion of crucial details that simply couldn't be cut for the sake of time and pacing. This first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the most faithful adaptation since the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's also just like all the previous films in that it's spectacular entertainment - provided you don't mind the shadowy, deeply emotional, almost funereal direction the stories have been going in. The depth of character is amazing, in all likelihood because of the film's overwhelming seriousness. The plot is engaging, a mixture of a road film, a scavenger hunt, and a revenge fable. It balances it's solemnity with a healthy dose of magic and, in a few very appropriate places, humor. It's also the first film in the series to end with a cliffhanger, always a welcome addition.

Being faithful, of course, does have its drawbacks. The film is not only dependent on the viewer's knowledge of the previous installments, but also on the viewer's willingness to listen. Many, many important things are said by many, many people, and if you're not going to pay attention, you might as well see something else. Fortunately, just about everything is explained at one point or another; this is usually thanks to Hermione Granger, who after seven years is no less of a bookworm. We also have numerous scenes of the three leads piecing things together from little more than sheer speculation, and this is just as it has been since the very first film. What they will discover in Part 2 remains to be seen, but you can rest assured that some of what they thought about certain things will turn out to be incorrect.

Part 1 begins exactly where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince left off. With the magical world in chaos following the untimely death of Albus Dumbledore and a hostile takeover by Lord Volemort and his loathsome cronies, our heroes are forced to make drastic changes. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now the most wanted wizard in the world, ships his aunt, uncle, and cousin off to a safe location. At Harry's side are his two best friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). So too are members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and even Hogwarts gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). It will be hard to keep Harry's location a secret from the snake-faced Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), since it seems he can easily be traced.

A series of terrible events force Harry, Hermione, and Ron to go on the run; they magically transport themselves from one isolated location to another, taking refuge in a special tent that, like Dr. Who's telephone booth, holds more space than its outer dimensions suggest. Their mission: Seek and destroy magical objects called Horcruxes, all of which contain a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry thought he had found one at the end of the previous film, but that item - a locket - turned out to be a fake. Finding the real locket will involve an interrogation of a cranky house elf named Kreacher (voiced by Simon McBurney), the kidnapping of a shady wizard named Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden), and a carefully planned break-in into the Ministry of Magic, where, in disguise, our three friends will run into their old nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).

These and other events are carefully crafted, but they're also expected. Not so expected is the ways in which Harry, Hermione, and Ron are developed. The world as they knew it is gone - no more Quiddich games, no more visits to Hogsmeade, no more classes at Hogwarts. They've abandoned their former lives. In short, they've grown up. Yes, but why did they have grow up in this particular way? Why are Hermione and Ron following Harry when it's obvious he has nothing to go on apart from memories of vague conversations with Dumbledore? Was Dumbledore the great wizard Harry thought him to be, or were there chapters of his life he intentionally never revealed? Our three friends are lost, confused, and weary, stuck on a quest for objects that could literally be anywhere. These include the fabled Deathly Hallows, three magical items symbolized as a line within a circle within a triangle.

The Harry Potter films have gone from wonderfully whimsical to delightfully dark to terribly tragic. We've marveled at their heroes, shuddered at their villains, and mourned at the loss of beloved figures. They've ignited our imaginations and beckoned us to follow along with them. Before, I've taken the approach of the giddy fanboy, brimming with excitement and anticipation. In the case of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I take an approach of resignation and elegy. It's the beginning of the end. I always knew it was coming, but even after the passage of nine years - ten when Part 2 is released next summer - it still feels as if it's coming too soon. This new movie is wonderful, but I will always remember with longing the first time I saw three fresh-faced eleven year olds going on their first magical adventure.",1290124800,4,5161,4.853575482406357

It is fine if they want to leave out a part that didn't really have any effect, but in all the movies there are many details that are mentioned that blatantly go against the books.

3804744,4,B001UV4XI8,"The first half in what will become the final part of the Harry Potter Film franchise... and its pretty cool.

Basically this is set at a crossroads for the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione as they have come to accept that they will not be going back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Albus Dumbledore is dead, Voldemort is triumphant and it would appear that the moment Harry Potter turns 17, the magic that has always protected him and his distant relations is at an end.

Other factors lead to Harry and his friends living in hiding from the Wizarding world as they look for Horcruxes, the magical devices that grant Voldemort his immortality and destroy them. After what had happened in the last movie, the trios attempt to find Horcruxes is aimless but they find one, whilst the diabolical instrument threatens to tear them apart.

But even more than this, the trio learn more about how Voldemort now seeks something mightier than a Horcrux, as the title of this movie is called the Deathly Hallows. Which leads to a really good scene in which the trio learn from their own mythology about powerful instruments that can make one the master of death.

It leads to a conclusion which is only a brief respite for the trio.

All things considered this movie feels more like a scavenger hunt for one item that they finally destroy. With only three more - that they know of anyway - to go. Very good movie. B+",1517097600,,1419,4.570866141732283

Harry Potter ""jumps the shark"" in this one (look it up).  I suppose it's supposed to be a Death/visit heaven/resurrection theme a la Jesus Christ, but it somehow comes up as a cheap counterfeit.  I felt I'd seen it before, then I remembered when good Kirk and bad Kirk being split and then rejoined in the transporter.  Same thing.

At lunch the next day I sat with them and I had a bunch of questions about this latest ""Harvey Potter movie.""

3805396,5,B001UV4XI8,"The grand finale of the Harry Potter series is so grand it took two movies. Part 1 has Voldemort's death eaters and snatchers wreaking havoc across the magic community.  Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron go on the run from an interrupted wedding, seeking the Horcruxes that are the secret to the Dark Lord's power.  The expedition involves sneaking into the Ministry of Magic in London, in disguise, and roaming the countryside on the hunt for a missing sword, while relying on Hermione's seemingly bottomless bag of tricks.

This is a tough episode. The young trio are very much on their own, and the strain is showing.  Harry's endless courage has to be balanced by the smarts of Hermione and the good sense of Ron.  A nearly fatal encounter with Voldemort's minions is resolved with the help of an old friend of Harry's but not without cost...

This two disc edition has some extras, including background on the making of the movie, including some fabulous location shooting in Glen Etive in Scotland.  Of most interest to this reviewer was an extended discussion between J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, and Steve Kloves, the writer who translated the story into a viable screenplay.  This could easily have been an adversarial relationship, but their discussion reveals  a remarkable level of collaboration and of agreement on what is important in the storyline.  Highly recommended to fans of the series.",1486339200,,1434,4.9375

There are overtones of the French Resistance during WWII and while I'm never a fan of breaking one book up into two movies, there is plenty of reason to do so here.  As the Potter series ends it delivers more difficult, mature content to the audience.  Definitely not for young children.",1472860800,,405,4.757142857142857

3806650,5,B001UV4XI8,"Arrived in great condition, I bought Part 2 as well. This is one of my favorite movies as the three main characters have less supporting cast involved and you get to see their characters in the worst of situations. The Deathly Hallows have none of the early cheer of the first movies and so depict a parallel of the coming-of-age trials of adolescence.",1466035200,,352,4.603174603174603
3806651,1,B001UV4XI8,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,2,1188,4.8088235294117645

I literally have to ride the volume levels to hear the dialog and then slam the volume knob down to keep the sound effects from blowing my speakers up. At least the video quality is so muddy on darker scenes that it's difficult to discern what's on the screen, and it trips up the software so that individual elements twitch around.

3807065,4,B001UV4XI8,"David Yates, who also directed the previous film in the Potter franchise (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B002PMV9FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)</a>, would have done better by it had he divided it in two as he has the current title.  Like Richard Lester in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Musketeers/dp/6305037264/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Musketeers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Musketeers/dp/6305037256/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Musketeers</a>, it gives him sufficient time to work his way through all the complexities of the longest and probably darkest of the seven beloved volumes.

Not quite 17 (at which age he will be free of the Trace placed on all young wizards), Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself, not completing his final year at Hogwarts as he had expected, but on a wanted poster and the run from Voldemort  (Ralph Fiennes) as the Dark Lord's forces take control of first the Ministry of Magic and next the school itself.  Even his Muggle relations, the dreadful Dursleys, are in danger and are somehow (I'd have loved to know how!) persuaded to move out of their house lock, stock, and barrel, and Harry's friend Hermione (Emma Watson) bespells her own parents into forgetting she ever existed.  Only the Weasleys and the old Order of the Phoenix--Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), Kingsley Shacklebolt (George Harris), Nymphadora Tonks (Natalia Tena), Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), and Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden)--remain staunch, and there's even some question about some of them: when Mad-Eye concocts an elaborate scheme to get Harry to safety, they're ambushed and suffer three casualties plus one desertion.

It soon becomes clear that Harry must save himself now, by finding the gnome-forged Sword of Gryffindor (which vanished after he used it to kill the Basilisk in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-Single-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000W746GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>) and locating and destroying the remaining four of the six Horcruxes in each of which Voldemort has hidden a fragment of his soul in order to attain immortality. So he, Hermione, and pal Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), who's in love with Hermione, go on the run, with no one but themselves (and a few magical tools) to depend on.  Clashing with or avoiding Death Eaters, Dementors, Snatchers, and a witch who turns out to be a serpent in disguise, and once penetrating in disguise into the Ministry building itself, the trio eventually learn from wizardly news-editor Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans) that they also have three more artifacts to find--the Deathly Hallows of the title, one of which, the Elder Wand, is the most powerful wand ever created.  Of course, the problem is that Voldemort knows about them too, and he's on the hunt.  Meanwhile, the Death Eaters' supremacy is portrayed as being very similar to the early career of German Naziism (one wonders if Hitler existed in Harry's world, and if he did, why no other countries' wizards are doing anything about the situation); Muggle families are being found dead, and even Lucius (Jason Isaacs) and Draco (Tom Felton) Malfoy seem to be wondering whether allying with Voldemort was a mistake.  Full of suspense, action, peril, character development (especially in Ron's perceived rivalry with Harry), wonderful effects, a good score, and even moments of lightness (a wedding in the Weasleys' back yard), this movie is longer than most but well worth staying with, and I'm looking forward to the second part.",1457049600,,3941,6.149090909090909

3807160,3,B001UV4XI8,"I've been indulging in the Harry Potter movie series while recovering from an injury, and this one is not my favorite. The best, in my opinion, is the Half-blood Prince. This movie is mostly the kids out camping and a lot of super creepy no-nose Voldermort scenes. The acting is better than it started, but not great. The Hermoine-Ron relationship is not believable, although you can't blame that solely on the actors, it just doesn't make sense. In my opinion, Harry should have been with Luna, and I also think the actor playing Luna is one of the best in the series. I think a good screenwriter could have condensed this into one movie, taking some liberties with the text and skipping some scenes. I think dragging it out into two was a mistake, this movie is pretty boring.",1454803200,,778,4.60431654676259

It says a digital copy is included however mine did not include a digital copy in it and on the back of the outer case  says the digital redemption deadline was Nov 2013. If it is not going to contain a non expired digital copy than it shouldn't be advertised as including one, false advertising at its finest. Very disappointed Amazon.

I should point out that my wife and I have the same Panasonic TV in two different rooms, though our computers are somewhat different.  When I watched this movie (and Part 2 as well) on my TV, the screen image was way too dark.  When I watched the same movies on my computer, there was no problem with darkness.  So I was a little surprised when my wife reported the exact opposite results from the same DVDs; the movie was too dark on her computer screen but it looked just fine on her TV.  For all other media, we have no problems with either television or computer monitor.",1440028800,,731,4.338235294117647

In a way the book itself was a duology: first the setup, the endless movement, the wait, the anticipation; second, the battle to end all battles and the tying up of all loose ends. That being said, I only gave it 4 stars. Since it got a two part movie I believe that there were important things that could have been integrated into this movie that were not, such as the rebel radio station and running into known characters multiple times in the wood.",1438560000,,655,4.377049180327869

He realizes he is, "" the one"" and is humbled to take on the task of finishing what Dumbledore had started, hunting horcruxes. Hermoine Granger played by the beautiful Emma Watson is the picture of true friendship in this film she is torn between love and what is right. Her choices stand as a true testimony of what real friendship can withstand. Ron Weasley's character starts to give into his inner self pity and has to make a choice, as he is about to lose a friend and the love of his life. When faced with this choice what direction will he go? You will have to watch and find out.",1434672000,,692,4.4140625

3808595,3,B001UV4XI8,"When they made the decision to cut the final book of the Harry Potter series in half, my first reaction was disappointment.  While I enjoyed the book as a whole, I found the first half of the book drawn out and repetitive.  I was afraid the movie would turn out to be the same.  Having watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 last night, I'm sorry to say I was right.

First and foremost, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF MOVIES.  In fact, I would recommend you watch them before you see this one.  It assumes you remember what is happening and doesn't really spend much time at all in back story.  Since I haven't watched any of the movies since the last one was in the theater in summer or 2009 and I haven't read any of the books since summer of 2007.  I'm a bit rusty on my Potter lore, so even I found myself trying to remember everything that had gone on before.  That, of course, if mostly my fault, although a little bit of reminders might have been nice.

The movie starts out with dark times for our heroes.  With Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) growing in power, most of those who oppose him are in hiding.  The same is true of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).  The three set out on a quest to find and destroy the Horcruxes that contain little bits of Voldemort's soul.  The only hope of defeating him once and for all is to find and destroy them all.  Just two problems - they don't know where they are or how to destroy them.  Will they be able to avoid capture and destroy the Horcruxes before Voldemort destroys them?

As I said, the movie pretty much just jumps right into the story with barely enough bits and pieces to remind us where we are.  You need to see the last couple of movies to understand what is happening.  We are reaching the climax of the epic tale, so that is to be expected.

The most die hard fans have long bemoaned the fact that the movies leave out scenes or even entire sub-plots from the books.  At times I have understood their frustration when my favorite scenes didn't make the movie.  However, when the books are 500+ pages, you have to cut somewhere.  By turning the last book into two movies, they are able to include so much more.  In this case, it isn't a good thing.  There were long passages of the final book that were repetitive and boring.  They could have condensed much of what happened in the middle of the book and turned the story into a good movie.  Instead, I found myself wondering more than once how much longer we had to go before the movie was over.

The book was saved by some great action scenes, most of which were at the end.  The second part is going to be outstanding.  There are some good scenes with great tension here, and they were well executed, keeping my interest the entire time.

Like the book, many of the characters we've grown to love from the early books in the series are reduced to cameos here.  One main character that I can think of doesn't even appear at all.  I was expecting it, but I still missed them.

The have heard complaints about the acting over the years, but I never found it that bad.  I'd say the acting was fine here as well.  It never pulled me out of the film.  In fact, at times the acting really made the emotions come to life.

The special effects were outstanding as well.  Even when I knew what was a special effect, only the analytical part of my brain saw it as such.  The rest of me bought it all.

Parents need to take the PG-13 rating seriously.  We're talking about war here, folks.  There are some very dark scenes and several characters die.  Also, a few of the scenes could frighten kids (I'm being vague here to not spoil things).  Yes, there are some very funny moments that help break the tension, but overall this isn't the light kid's films the early ones were.  Know that your kids can handle the dark nature of the film before you take them.

I was hoping to be proved wrong with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.  I was hoping to absolutely love it.  But without the second half of the story, it turns out to be the weakest of the film adaptations to date.",1431388800,,4198,4.30690537084399

3809797,5,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part One is the first of the two part film adaptation of the book of the same name.  This film shows the last of the Dursley family.  Their swan song is a bit of a disappointment.  In the series, the Dursley's never seem to grow or develop.  One would think as Harry matures and moves into his destiny his Aunt Petunia would ask for her sister to be avenged.  But this doesn't happen.  In the book Dudley Dursley gives a sort of thanks to Harry for saving him from the Dementors but that's it. It one of flaw in the tale which doesn't match real life as I understand it.  Too often, people I didn't like while young became, in my maturing eyes, far nicer people.  Additionally the cause of the Voldemort insurgency-the pure vs. mud controversy seems too forced to be a rational conflict.  Do the mud bloods have some advantage in financial dealings to the pures?  Is there some rising tension in the magical world equal to that of the Late Roman Republic?

Any rate, back to the story:

Harry has a complication due to ""the trace"" being on him until he is 18.  As a result the Order of the Phoenix must move Harry by broomstick which sets up the first confrontation with the Death Eaters.  Mad Eye Moody and Hedwig the Owl both perish in this battle.  At the start of the series Harry Potter was escapist fantasy where factory workers, cubical dwellers, and school kids could imagine they were the center of a grade-school level magical battle between good and evil.  This film moves that idea into despairing adulthood.  With the escape by broomstick, the movie takes the ever darkening situation left over from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and starts off and moves that darkness to an ever more powerful explosion.

The children-Ron, Hermione, and Harry attend a wedding of Ron's older brother.  Such a wedding in and of itself is a passage to adulthood.  The three also get an inheritance from Dumbledore-another adult marker.  They are supposed to use the inheritance to seek out and destroy the horcruxes.  However, they must figure out how, exactly to use them to do such a thing.

Eventually the three go searching for the horcruxes, find one and then must come to grips with how to destroy the object.  Meanwhile that horcrux pulls down a depressing shroud over the heroes.  The filmography here is excellent.  Less music, cold campgrounds, empty moor, and louring clouds give a sharp edge to the scenes.  As the movie reaches its climax and the Death Eaters capture Harry, Ron and Hermione the tension increases, especially as Hermione is now a young, fully mature woman as a captive of such rough people.  One can't help feel great sympathy for agony as she is tortured in the Malfoy Mansion.  The movie ends with Voldemort seemingly triumphant and the stage is set for the final battle.",1417478400,,2844,4.6546184738955825

3810068,4,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1
 The Deathly Hallows will very likely be the biggest hit of the movie year.  What we want to know, is should we join the throngs of Potter fans at our local mini-multiplex.  The answer is a very positive Yes.  The latest, and next to the last, in the long running Potter franchise certainly meets the high levels of entertainment that the other films have trained us to expect.  This is however a different kind of film.  Gone are the cute magic tricks like the molting Phoenix bird and talking paintings.  Magic is still here, in plenty, but it is just a back drop now, like sagebrush in a Western.  Magic is necessary but only as it supports the story.  And the story is deadly serious.
 The Dark Lord is back and he has pulled out all the stops.  Neither wizard nor witch nor humble muggle is safe from his wrath.  He stages a coup at the Ministry of Magic and installs a regime with definite Nazi overtones.  Wizards are rounded up and executed.  A reign of terror is in full force.  Our three intrepid heroes must flee for their lives.  Deaths, injuries and betrayal follow the trio like a malignant albatross.  The two and a half hour long movie has the viewers on the seat edge throughout.  The film, from the opening shot, is tense, frightening and had me grateful for the comfort of a giant bag of popcorn.
 Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson of course are back in their accustomed roles.  The net worth of these youngsters ranges from a mere $32 million to $50 million.  They were worth every farthing as far as I am concerned.  We have grown to love the three of them but in Deathly Hallows we learn to fear for them.  There are no light hearted moments of teen romance in this one, only the fear of the Dark Lord and the havoc that he wreaks upon their friends and the steady erosion of their finer selves by dark and tainted objects.  I don't think I saw a smile in the whole film.  We become terrifyingly acquainted with the dark side of magic.
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt. 1 is rated PG-13 for violence, death and magic.  It has already brought in as astonishing $330 million worldwide and looks to be one of the top grossing films of all time.  As art, the film is nothing special, nothing like the wonderful Get Low earlier in the year for instance.  As entertainment, especially for Potter fans, it is a smash.  How often are you actually concerned for the characters in an action/adventure film?  We give four spinning saw blades for this next to the last Harry Potter movie.  You won't nod off when watching this one.",1414454400,,2606,4.443974630021142

3810698,2,B001UV4XI8,"I appreciate that this was more of a build-up film to the final climactic chapter, but all the same this one was burdensome, where frequently the characters are just camping out in the woods, or at a riverside, or on a hilltop, staring thoughtfully at an old snitch, etc.  There are a few action scenes but the pacing and padding just drags. I thought the violence/horror elements were a bit strong for PG-13, such as the teacher being tortured and killed (and eaten by a snake) at the beginning of the film, and there is plenty of blood and violence - the series having come a long way from the more playful and less harmful days of book 1.  The absence of John Williams music is also notable as well.",1406764800,,702,4.392307692307693

3810755,3,B001UV4XI8,"At some point, the whole saga became more about trying to cram in the event that follows the event that follows the event till the end, and in the pursuit of event sequences, something obviously gets lost.  I just don't know what really is amiss, but I can say, all the characters, familiar or otherwise, are simply flat, and and though I already know that I should, I just cannot learn to care about them.

3810888,5,B001UV4XI8,"I thought they did a great job of turning the basic part of the books into a good set of movies. I love the music, the castings were spectacular (not counting the 2nd Dumbledore) and the sets were awesome. I wasn't bummed to hear they were turning this into two movies and wish that they had made them all about an hour per 100 pages.
The characters in this one are good and the long time spent on the run for the year was nicely paced. Having read the books I knew all the little bits about the details that made looking at the scene's a little better, but they were beautiful shots.
Now with the DVD being out for both parts it is a lot more fun since you don't have to wait for the conclusion.",1404777600,,696,4.087591240875913

The book always came out before the movie and I read every one of them and had every VHS to Blu-ray from paper back to hard books.  You can't say enough good things about the Director's and Novelist.  She knew where she was going and it was to the very top as she was a creature of adventure, love of style but you know, I'm now 75 years of age and still love the books and DVD's.  I really think that children when they grew up would not be scared by the films and small children should not have seen it until in their teens.  I was in my late thirties to early 40's and I LOVED ALL THE BOOKS AND MOVIES!  It was a fun movie for older people and teens.",1395705600,,786,3.9745222929936306

Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.

A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a ""young adult/kid"" series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told.

-Merriam-Webster Dictionary

You hope for the things you don't have. You cant hope for love, joy, friendship, and safety when you have them. You can only hope for what you don't have. Hope is not found in times of fulfillment and joy, but rather in darkness, despair and discontent. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a film about hope, and as such, it is consistently dark and bleak as it pushes its characters to the edge of their limits. Yet even during the darkest of times it allows its characters the ability to hope. This success makes it not only the best in the series, but also one of the greatest cinematic feats of the past decade.

The Deathly Hallows Part I comes seventh in what might be the most famous film series of this generation. After a revolving door of directors, David Yates picked up the series from The Order of the Phoenix and on, and has done a phenomenal job of putting the darker elements of the books on display. It may come as a surprise to many readers to see J.K. Rowling listed as a producer  the person ultimately in charge of both the business and creative aspects of the film. Its great to see an author take such an active role in a film, and it certainly has an excellent payoff in the first part of Harry and the gangs final adventure.

Within the first five minutes of the film, two fan favorites are pushed to their limits. Thus far, no Harry Potter movie had taken the audience to such an extreme place of despair so quickly. Of course, with great risk comes great reward, and the Deathly Hallows Part I is full of reward. While Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint do a great job supporting Watson, she is truly the focus of this film. I won't ruin anything, but I can say that Watson effectively uses a wide range of emotions early and often. While Harry and Ron appropriately lose their minds through various points in the film, Hermione works as the glue that holds the whole thing together. While this can be seen earlier on in the series, it is not done as effectively and as potently as in the Deathly Hallows Part I.

The film also succeeds in capturing darkness and hope in its cinematography. This film is dreary and bleak throughout, and yet it is mysterious and beautiful at all time. This can be seen pouring out of the cinematography and is extremely effective in emphasizing the tone and message of the film. And I won't spoil the hopeful moments for you, but I will say its worth the crap Harry, Ron, and Hermione are put through. Between all this, an excellent supporting cast, and a more than experienced crew, The Deathly Hallow Part I takes this series to the next level!

All this isn't to say that the movie is perfect. There are a few minor flaws. Although the last book was split into two films  which paid off artistically despite its financial motivations  the writers didn't find time really honor all the great minor characters in the series. Hagrid, in particular, was given just one line of dialogue that, which despite Robbie Coltranes best effort, didn't amount to much more than a giant piece of corn.

While it was great seeing the film hone in on the main trio, it was a shame to see such a wonderful supporting cast of characters wasted. Another disappointment was seeing Ginny built up as Harrys love interest in the first third of the film, only to be dropped for the entirety of the second and third acts. This ultimately paid off, as it allowed Harry and Hermione to explore their friendship more fully, but it still would have been cool to see all of Harry and Ginnys sexual tension go somewhere.

Despite a lack of screen time for its great supporting cast, The Deathly Hallows Part I is nothing short of phenomenal in capturing hope amongst darkness and showing that this film series has grown up with its horde of followers and reluctant protagonists. To put it bluntly, this is an adult film. This film feels more like the Bourne Trilogy, the Dark Knight Trilogy, Rise of the Planet of the Apes or Skyfall than a movie based on a fantasy book series for kids, and that change in tone and style work perfectly.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I isn't just a film for Harry Potter fans. If you just love great films, here you are! The Deathly Hallows Part I is an incredible cinematic experience that reminds audiences that there is always hope amongst the darkness, as well as reward in taking great risks.",1390780800,5,4514,4.499389499389499

3811660,5,B001UV4XI8,"This is the beginning of the end, so to speak.  This is part one of a two part offering and while readers of the book will definitely notice some variations, it's still a well-told story.  Yes, it's dark.  Yes, it's sinister, but look who all is involved.  If you don't know the story by now, then you've been living under a rock, somewhere.  Lord Voldemort has all but taken over the magic world and is wreaking havoc all over the place.  He feels invincible because of the six horcruxes he has created.  He's totally unaware that he made a seventh, but you'll learn that fact as the plot progresses.  By the way, if you think Part One is dark, wait till you view Part Two.  As all know, it ends with Lord Voldemort's destruction, but oh, the price paid for this!  Still, the CD is good and I do recommend it.  You will, of course, want to view Part Two.  By all means, do!  While not quite ""by the book,"" it's also worth seeing.",1388534400,,930,4.275862068965517
3811661,2,B001UV4XI8,"I can see why this movie never made it to free network tv.  Dark content aside, the picture is almost completely shot it the dark.  So dark that you can barely make out what you're looking at.  Worse yet, I got a ""network disconnect"" message and never saw the last ten minutes worth.  Doubt that I missed much.....",1388448000,,314,4.362068965517241

3811797,5,B001UV4XI8,"Loved the books loved the movies, wish they were all in 3D it does not add much but in a magical movie it adds just that little added flare. Series was so well written and then transitioned to movies so well.
If they remade the series in 3D I would be such a sucker and buy them all over again! I bought them in DVD, then again in blu-ray, so why not again in 3D",1384905600,,362,3.84

3811800,4,B001UV4XI8,"Not as in-depth as I had hoped, but there is a lot of story they tried to pack into 2.5 hours of screen time. They did a good job of interpreting the book, left out stuff they could, kept what they needed. It's been fun to watch these actors grow up on screen, too!",1384300800,,265,3.925925925925926

3811893,5,B001UV4XI8,"This series is fun. Each movie is well done. The acting, artwork, costumes, everything is worth watching. The musical background is also beautifully done. Sometimes it's fun to move into a world that is wild and crazy, and just forget the present. This is a film you can watch with anyone without embarrassment.",1384128000,,311,4.886792452830188
3811894,5,B001UV4XI8,"I wasn't sure about the plan to split up the story, but it ended up working quite well. I loved being able to sit in the story with Harry, Ron and Hermione as they searched for the Horcruxes and figured out their relationships.",1383264000,,227,4.3023255813953485
3811895,5,B001UV4XI8,"Great movie. Watched it on the kindle fire hd. I don't Really think that it had a s many details as the book, but it was great. When dobby dies, I think that is probably the saddest death of all movies.",1383177600,,202,3.951219512195122

3811902,3,B001UV4XI8,"Well, it was not as much fun as theoretical ones.  It was slow and drawn out without much of anything happening but struggles between Harry, Hermione and Weasley. The last two films could have been made into one.",1382140800,,212,4.578947368421052
3811973,3,B001UV4XI8,"As an adult, I am not a big Harry Potter Fan, but I found this episode to be quite entertaining.

3812065,5,B001UV4XI8,"With this next to last installment of the Harry Potter series, we have the beginnings of a major, but logical, turn of events.  Deathly Hallows Part 1 leads us into that final reckoning with Voldemort that we all know has been coming, and, as such, a much darker take on that inevitability.  All previous movies have really been about the training necessary to confront the boss; mere rehearsals for the final showdown.  With these final two installments we get to the real heart of the matter and it must be darker.  No, Hallows Part 1 (and for that matter Part 2 as well) are not as much fun as the previous movies.  This one's getting much more serious, as it should. These movies are so superbly crafted and executed that they are a testament to the near reverence held for the source material by Rowling.  The directors have done an amazing job bringing Rowling's books to life in a way that truly reflects their spirit.  Needless to say it's also a testament to the wondrous descriptive writings of Rowling which enabled this to happen in the first place.
Also, as a movie, we watch as the character relationships between Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginger come to fruition.  The acting by all concerned in these films has been a delight to watch.

I have only one negative, and that has to do with the 3D version of the film:  it comes across as way too dark.  When I watch the 2D Blueray version, it looks great, but for some reason, 3D is not nearly as enjoyable because of that darkness.  I attempted to find some way to lighten it up, but couldn't figure it out.  My other 3D films, such as Avatar or Life of Pi, etc don't have this problem, so I am wondering if it was simply a case of this particular version of the Deathly Hallows that has this issue.  Part 2 has the same problem in 3D.  I will continue to investigate and see if there is any solution to this. BTW:  I have a 60"" LG ""smart"" 3D tv.  I have had no other issues at all with other 3D films with this set.

If you are a fan of the whole Harry Potter experience, Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a must and is yet another very worthy work of art in that franchise.  Obviously, if you are not a fan, then there is probably little here that will compel you to seek it out.  It is part of a piece and an essential component of the whole.",1380412800,3,2306,4.2695852534562215
3812066,5,B001UV4XI8,im a big Harry Potter nerd. i love all the movies. i would suggest the movie to anybody who likes sci-fi movies.,1380326400,,112,4.136363636363637

3812068,4,B001UV4XI8,"I mean, the books are always better, and this movie is about the slow part of the last book, so you won't see much action. But ypu definitely need to watch this to understand the part 2.",1380153600,,186,4.054054054054054

3812070,5,B001UV4XI8,Still one of the best series for the past years. And the last 2 movies were just unbelievably awesome. You need to finish your harry potter collection if you don't already own this,1380067200,,180,4.484848484848484

3812113,5,B001UV4XI8,I never get tired of this series.  It seems impossible to do the book (as involved as the Harry Potter series is) justice with the time constraints of a movie.  However the movie is fantastic.,1379808000,,192,4.457142857142857

3812117,4,B001UV4XI8,"The Harry Potter books and movies were somewhat disappointing in the middle.  The movies of course cut out a lot of material and this really hurt the fifth and sixth movies.  The seventh movie, however, was a lot better at incorporating the major points from the book.  There are still some changes and omissions, but that's part of Hollywood.  The movie is an epic and entertaining ride and worth watching.",1379635200,,407,4.771428571428571

3812392,5,B001UV4XI8,"In what otherwise would have been the seventh year of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), and his friends Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint, who, at some point, always wears autumn colors complimentary of his ginger-colored hair), and Hermione Granger( a gracefully matured , heart-shaped faced Emma Watson)we find them, courtesy of Director David Yates, beginning to carry out the plan to hunt for and destroy the magical relics, known as horcruxes, which enable Harry's great nemesis, Lord Voldemort(Ralph Fiennes) to maintain  his immortality.
  Interestingly, throughout this saga, J.K. Rowling has incorporated many characters of English folklore, including the house elf, Dobby(Toby Jones), and the Hippogriff Buckbeak. It has been noted that artifacts similar to horcruxes, which allow a murderous villain to maintain immortality also figure in Slavic folklore. Professor Rowling is, needless to say, impressively well-read.
 Having come a long way from the first film, which was lit in a warm and glowing hues, the late adolescent years of Harry Potter are captured  in darker, sinister, and more shadowy tones.
 We begin with the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour(Bill Nighy) reassuring the British Wizarding world of the strength of the Ministry  despite the tightening of the grip of the Dark Forces.
  Former Hogwarts Professor and current Headmaster Severus Snape(Alan Rickman) arrives at Malfoy Manor, the home of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy(Jason Isaacs and Helen McRory), and their son, Draco( Tom Felton), which has been  commandeered  by Voldemort and the Death Eaters to discuss the whereabouts of Harry and their plan to eliminate all non-pureblood wizards. Hoping to cement the loyalty of his followers, including  Death Eater politician Pius Thicknesse(Guy Henry), Voldemort victimizes Hogwarts' former Muggle Studies Professor, Charity Burbage(Carolyn Pickles) whose pleas for aid from her friend Snape go unanswered. Young Draco witnesses this episode with visible sickness and pallor.
 In the meantime, Harry has seen his relatives, the Dursleys(Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw and Harry Melling) safely evacuated from their home on Privet Drive, as they are under threat( The unedited version shows Mrs. Dursley's expression of regret over the loss of her sister as she departs); Hermione, enacting her own ""Witches' Protection Program"",  erases her Muggle parents' (Ian Kelly, Michelle Finley) memory of her before leaving home, while Ron waits to take action at his now-rebuilt home, The Burrow.
 Harry packs his bags and his bird, Hedwig, awaiting his final departure , and in a poignant moment, pausing one last time to inspect the cupboard under the stairs, which was his initial room, and the little soldier figurines that were his only playthings.
 Soon the painful memories are replaced with glad tidings as he welcomes his best friends and other members of the Order of the Phoenix into the Dursley's unfurnished living room, including the now-married Lupin and Tonks(David Thewlis, Natalia Tena), Mad-Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson), Ron's oldest brother, Bill(Domhall Gleeson), whom Harry meets for the first time, and his now-fiancee Fleur de La Coeur(Clemence Poesy), the Weasley Twins(James and Oliver Phelps), Mundungus Fletcher( Andy Linden) on whom Moody keeps a tight reign, Kingsley Shacklebot(George Harris), and Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)besides Ron and Hermione.
 Moody informs Harry that  those now in charge of the Ministry no longer have any part in his protection, and that Harry has a trace on him. Despite Harry's protests, Fleur, Ron, Hermione, the twins, and Mundungus  take on Harry's physical persona using polyjuice potion under Moody's supervision, temporarily transforming into Harry's dopplegangers to confuse lurking death eaters, who will hopefully be unable to detect Harry as he transfers to a safehouse--specifically, The Burrow. The journey is almost immediate perilous with two casualties and a serious injury.
 After waking from another telling bad dream, a guilt-ridden Harry sets out from  the Burrow with backback in tow, intending to begin the horcrux-finding mission, but Ron reminds him that he will need help and turns him back.
 As preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding get underway there is a sweetly intimate boyfriend-girlfriend moment when Ron's burgeoning kid sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), dressed for the event, seeks assistance in the zipping of her gown, revealing her flawless  porcelain back as Harry gently obliges. The two express their views on the appropriateness of a wedding, ""given everything that's going on"" in Ginny's words. Harry reveals he is in agreement with Ron about the matter, whereas his views had ben different shortly before. The young couple kiss although Harry sheepishly departs when George Weasley shows up... Perhaps a little foreshadowing of domestic bliss for our hero?
 Scrimgeour appears to execute Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon's) will, in which he bequeathes his delumiator to Ron, a copy of a children's book, ""The Tales of the Beetle Bard"" to Hermione, and  the first golden snitch Harry caught in a Quidditch game to Harry, as well as the missing Sword of Griffyndor.
  Harry enjoys the wedding, where he is reunited with Luna Lovegood( Evanna Lynch) and introduced to her father, Xenophilius(Rhys Ifans), editor of the newspaper, ""The Quibbler"", which unlike its rival, ""The Daily Prophet"", supports Harry, who notices a pendant with a mysterious symbol worn by Mr. Lovegood. A chat with 'Prophet' Commentator Elphias Dodge(Peter Cartwight), and the Weasley's aunt Muriel( Matyelok Gibbs) before word comes of the Ministry's fall, Scrimegeour's death, and the approach of the Death Eaters. Harry Ron and Hermione dissapparate, seeking refuge in London. Having planting an extension charm in her small bag, Hermione provides clothes into which they can change. A brief respite in a diner is interrupted by two more Death Eaters.
 They hide at Grimmauld Place as they had done previously. House elf Kreatur(Timothy Bates) is caught spying on them after they find a fake horcrux, and they learn that Mundungus Fletcher stole the real one. They dispatch him to find Fletcher, and along with Dobby, retrieve him and learn that Dolores Umbridge( Imelda Staunton) now has the real horcrux.
 The three launch a James Bond style mission to  break into the Ministry and retrieve the horcrux, involving polyjuice potion, floo  networks, and exiting via commodes. The ministry shows trappings reminiscent of Nazi Germany, with brutal interrogations about wizards' family backgrounds, and an anti-Muggle propaganda machine. Disguised as Official Albert Runcorn (David O' Hara), Harry learns of a hit list of Muggle supporters, where he sees the photos of those he lost and learns that Hermione is targeted. Disguised as Reginald Cattermole(Steffan Rhodie), whose wife Mary(Kate Fleetwood)is under interrogation and Malfalda Hopkirk(Sophie Thompson) , Ron and Hermione manage to claim the horcrux and escape, rescuing Mrs. Cattermole in the process. But Ministry Official Yaxley ( Peter Mullen) nearly captures them.
 After treating an injured Ron, Harry and Hermione set up camp in a forest, they spend their days unsuccessfully trying to destroy the locket. When they decide to take turns wearing it, the evil locket brings out depression in Hermione and belligerence in each of the boys. Hermione has an epiphinal moment about an matter concerning the much-need sword of Griffyndor, but as they relocate, tensions between the boys increase, and the insecure Ron  accuses Hermione of preferring Harry to him, and after a near physical fight, in which he dismisses Harry's concern for his family,Ron leaves.
 Harry consoles Hermione as they dissapparate to the White Cliffs of Dover. There is a sweet scene of temporary delight in their tent when the two dance to music on the radio, courtesy of the ever-considerate Harry, who tries to bring Hermione out of her funk. They soon visit Harry's birthplace, Godric's Hollow on Christmas Eve, where Hermione sees the mysterious symbol worn by Mr. Lovegood on a churchyard grave, and  a tearful Harry stands before his parents' grave in the film's most poignant scene.
 The celebrated wizard authoress Bathilda Bagshot(Hazel Douglas), encounters them outside the church, and they go to the house where Harry's parents were slain . Voldemort's snake Nagini, emerges from Bathilda Bagshot's now immobile corpse to confront the two teens, and Harry is back in battle in his former nursery. Hermione rescues him, taking him to the Forest of Dean, where the sword appears, and Ron returns in time to rescue Harry from drowning in the lake, nearly strangled by the locket, which Ron destroys. The reconciled trio meet with Mr. Lovegood , who, after Hermione narrates an impressively shown tale featuring computerized shadow puppetry, reveals the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, but then forbids his guests to leave explaining that the Dark Lord has kidnapped Luna and will return her if he turns Harry over to him.
 Lovegood's plans go awry and the three escape, but are soon caught and taken to Malfoy Manor by snatchers. Belllatrix Lestrange,(Helena Bonham Carter),insists that her nephew, Draco positively identify the temporarily disfigured Harry, but Draco declines. Bellatrix tortures Hermione as Harry and Ron are thrown into the dungeon with Mr. Ollivander, the wandmaker(John Hurt), the goblin Griphhook(Warwick Davis) and Luna.
 A battle ensues but the captives are rescued by an old friend with tragic consequences. As a close ally is lovingly lowered into his grave amid sands and tall wind-bent grasses as gentle as his nature, the Dark Lord cracks open another grave to steal the most powerful wand ever made to prepare for the final showdown....",1375833600,,9792,5.405121470781353

BUT, watching it a few years later, more removed from the book, I found this film totally delightful.  It was fun on its own.  And it was fun to be reminded through excellent visuals of the original read.

3812487,5,B001UV4XI8,"OK. So. Here we are.

I started into the Harry Potter phenomenon quite, quite late. Just about 6 months or so ago, in fact. I'm a Science Fiction fan, way more than fantasy or the ""magic"" genre. But.

HP was such a big deal, that I got the books on my Kindle, more to just find out what the big deal was, more than anything. And read them. And they were so incredibly good and fun and disturbing, on so many levels, that I had to also see the movies.

I've actually become quite a Harry Potter fan.

So, let's get down to it, shall we?

You have to understand that the movies need to be evaluated separately from the books. They are just not 100% true to the books. They can't be. You can't tell a 600 or 700 page book in 2 or 2.5 hours of screen time, you just can't.

So, if we leave the ""authenticity"" issue to the side... this is another great film, in a series of great films.

It really does, as all the Potter movies do, follow the basic story of the books. If you are an avid reader, you will see scenes you imagined in your head, acted out for you by the truly superb cast.

But the films, by necessity, must be taken as a separate entity.

This is another truly wonderful, excellent, superb addition to the Harry Potter film series.

The one thing I really love is, the film makers, _knowing_ they would have to abridge and condense, are internally consistent with their version of Potter.

I've become such a HP fan that I know the books well enough to, at least, go... ""Wait, wait, wait... we missed a scene, didn't we?"", or ""Wait, that didn't happen in the book, did it?"".

But when you view the films and the books as separate entities... this film, as all the others, tells the true Harry Potter _story_ magnificently.

All in all, I am, for myself, 100% thumbs up.",1374105600,21,1780,4.246290801186944

3812984,2,B001UV4XI8,"Our whole family loves Harry Potter. My 8-year-old has read the books half a dozen times, and regularly quotes them. But unlike any other Amazon movie we have watched, when there wasn't time to finish it before bedtime, there was no muttering or complaint. The next days passed without any request to finish it.

The effects are well done, which is why it gets 2 stars.

The movie doesn't tell a story, but instead recounts some scenes from the book, without a clear sense of what they mean, and many of the scenes shown are not in the book at all. Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent after Ron leaves them??? Ron wanting to kill Dolohov in the coffee shop, once is immobilized?

Like me, anyone who has read the books with pleasure, and watched all the preceding movies, is probably going to watch this one, but I don't recommend it.",1366156800,,837,4.493421052631579
3812985,5,B001UV4XI8,I wished after the third Harry potter movie they would of broken the movie into two parts because of how big the books were. It would of been more accurate and possibly better than they were. First two were almost word for word and three was pretty close but the forth was when it just became a little off since they left out so many scenes. And I don't think they even have extended versions of 3 and up. People are waiting for it but I think they only have it for Harry potter 1 and 2.

3813037,5,B001UV4XI8,"When I first watched this, I actually got a little bored.  It seemed to move a little too slowly.  I don't know what happened, but later it didn't seem to move so slowly.  I had been a Harry Potter fan for a little while, then got out of it.  Now I seem to be renewing my interest in it.

One thing I was always disappointed with is that there weren't more scenes with Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange.  I preferred the villains to the heroes.  However, JK didn't write much about them either.

Part 1 deals with the fall of the Ministry and the tightening grip of the Death Eaters.  Harry is trying to find the Hocruxes so he can destroy Voldemort, but he doesn't always know how to destroy them...or where any of them are.  Meanwhile, Voldemort is trying to find a legendary wand so he can defeat Potter.

You see a lot of character development with the difficult circumstances.  Ron must battle his own insecurities before he can be of help to his friends.  I loved the mythology of the Deathly Hallows.",1365206400,,1007,4.437158469945355

3813261,5,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 is a masterful translation from book to movie. Much Like with the Book Deathly hallows,this movie shows a different side of Harry Potter. With Harry and Hermione on the road hunting Horcruxes and learning about the Deathly Hallows,this movie takes place away from Hogwarts and that really gives the movie a feeling of freshness,a wonderful achievement for the 7th movie in a series. I liked how,in the movie,they actually SHOW the scene of Hermione modifying her parents memories instead of just mentioning it in passing. Very poignant scene that also gives a feeling for the magnitude of the situation. And the Voldemort meeting at the start of the movie is exceptionally well done. My favorite part of the movie,though,was the Tale of the Three Brothers. The animation of the Tale of the Three Brothers was just PERFECT! I had wondered how they were going to handle that part and it turned out to be one of the most satisfying parts of the whole movie. I especially liked the portrayal of death himself. It was bloody brilliant. The emotional side worked well as well. I like the fact that,in the movie,Harry does NOT use Polyjuice Potion when returning to Godric's Hallow. The godric's Hallow scenes,from the arrival,to the graves,to harry realizing he was standing in the very spot his parents had died,would not have worked as well cinematically if Polyjuice Juice Potion had been used. In the book it was fine,but,in the movie,not using Polyjuice Potion on Harry was the way to go. Those scenes were very moving. And the emotional climax hit home for me. In the books,the most emotional death for me apart from Dumbledore in HBP is Dobby. I cried twice watching this movie,1st when Dobby dies and 2nd when harry says ""I want to bury him,properly,without magic."" I've always admired the respect that Harry showed for Dobby in his death. I also think the best possible splitting point was picked. To end part 1 when Voldemort takes the Elder Wand was the perfect choice of a splitting spot. Splitting Deathly hallows into 2 movies was the right way to go. Bringing to life a different side of Harry Potter earns this movie 5 stars. :)",1362960000,,2182,4.805851063829787

3813266,5,B001UV4XI8,"While it is questionable whether out of all the HP novels this one deserves two films, the final product is eye candy and the action very fun, especially in 3D.  The characters you've all come to love and cherish are back.  Even Dumbledore, sort of.  Being twice as much film for about the same amount of content, this film and its counterpart Part 2 are closer to the book than their predecessors.  The addition of 3D is another plus for a series so dominated by special effects.

I wouldn't start my HP movie watching with this one, for obvious reasons, but it does satisfy and provide lots for the HP fan.  If you've never seen any of the previous movies or read the books, this is not for you.  There is just too much missing to make it stand alone.",1362528000,2,753,4.335714285714285

3813354,5,B001UV4XI8,"This is marginally the best produced Harry Potter film, with a compelling story, stunning visuals and special effects, superb acting and a fine turn behind the camera from David Yates. This is the first of two parts of course...and it was actually sad to contemplate there would only be one more film in the franchise. We have watched the three protagonists, Harry, Ron and Hermione, mature as characters from mere children to young adults; and we have watched Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson mature into superb actors. They deliver their best performances yet in this film. Many of the characters from past Harry Potter films also appear in this one, with the same actors playing them; and some die in the battle w/Voldemort and his dark forces; but don't be looking for a lot of facetime for any character except for the three protagonists. The exception is Voldemort, played again by Ralph Fiennes; because his presence is felt and visualized by Harry in addition to scenes that feature him in actual dialogue with other characters. You may remember from HALF BLOOD PRINCE that Voldemort has divided his soul into multiple units and each is stored in a Horcrux. Each Horcrux must be found and destroyed in order to destroy Voldemort. Harry and his two cohorts have already found and destroyed two Horcruxes in prior installments. Most of this film involves a search and destroy mission for the third, while avoiding Voldemort and his hoard of deatheaters and snatchers. The film has prelude written all over it, which of course it is; and it leaves us hungry for the next and final installment.",1361491200,,1613,4.890510948905109

3813532,3,B001UV4XI8,"Okay so the first time seeing this movie I thought it was okay to good. The beginning part was entertaining and lots of action. The second part though wasn't that good to me. The second time I watched the movie I realized the second part of the film when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were looking for the holkrons (sp?)  was incredibly boring. Yes they have to hide from the bad guys but sitting and standing around in and out of a tent for idk 20-40 minutes of the film isn't very entertaining. I know this is based off the book and maybe that part was in the book (idk I never read any but the first and second I believe) but it was still quite dull.

Then the last part of the movie it seemed to kinda pick up but well unfortunately when you start getting into it the movie ends and teases you with a type of ""watch the rest of the movie in part 2 whenever we release that."" Yes I know part 2 of the movie is already out but that's how I would have felt if I went to the movie at the movie theater. I wanted to wait to see this movie once I could watch part 2 with it cause I knew something like this would happen.

I had some extra credit for movies but there wasn't much to pick from on amazon's renting list. I wanted to rent part 1 and the part 2 movie but like I figured it part 2 was unavailable at the time.

I would say the one thing that really stood out for me in this movie was 1. Bill Nighy who you see right away in the film as the Minister Rufus Scrimgeour or you might recognize him as the vampire from those vampire movies. I don't know why but I really enjoyed seeing him on screen and was a bit disappointed you don't see him all that much. He really does have a very iconic face and voice.

And 2. The story you hear after the second part of the movie which talks about the Dealthy Hollows and where the story came from with the 3 wizards and Death. The animation and the story were very enjoyable and was looking forward to it the second time I watched the movie.

The ending of the movie could be quite sad to some people I won't spoil what happens you have to watch the movie to find out.

I found it extremely odd most popular reviews on other sites didn't really tell you anything. It was mostly ""the movie was great... looking forward to part 2... you should go see it"" and that was it. No mention of any problems or anything really. I was almost sure one of them would mention the boring part of the movie where they are just standing around inside or outside of the tent for a good long measure.

Its still a good enough movie to see especially if you have already seen the ones before it. I look forward to part 2 because iv already heard its pretty good and from the trailers and such it looks like it will be good and much more action packed.",1359590400,,2771,4.062271062271062

3813853,4,B001UV4XI8,"This movie, like its predecessor Half-Blood, left much of the joy of the novel aside to focus on the Tim Burton-esque landscape and dark and forboding cinema. After Order of the Phoenix, the sets became so grim that they no longer really represented Rowling's work. Even the table settings lacked food and festivities always provided by the kitchens of Hogwarts!

The last four Harry Potter's represent the director's vision with Hallows Pt. 1, the least satisfying. My dream is that a remake of the series, dedicated to more accurate representation of the novels, will begin before too long.

The stunted emotional range of the leads (and Radcliffe's self-reported inebriation during filming) took its toll as well in Hallows Pt. 1. Those who did not read the books will likely love it much more than those who longed to see more of Rowling and less of Hollywood.",1357344000,,864,4.910958904109589

3813931,3,B001UV4XI8,"I've said this before, the production team of director/writer/producer has not done JKRowling's work a good job, and they've proven it time and again. If they would have stayed with the book's outline they would have been better off, but alas, they stray like cats in heat and looking for ego satisfaction, or so it seems, for why else extract so much material and insert meaningless nonsense? From the start, the acting was natural, if not the best, due to lack of experience and these kids not being born in the business, but instead of using that to the production teams advantage, most of the directors only tried to ignore it or work around it, including the first director.

If it wasn't for the cometary distruction et al set to arrive again in '14, I would say the book series could do well with a tv series, as another film series would need a few more years before attempting a restart. The production team really shows their misguided folly in this last film set, but this is how the rest of us acquire examples not to follow. The film is alright to watch, but doesn't make you want to see it again. Just read the book, it is so much better and you get the chance to see the potential of 'what could have been'.",1356825600,,1222,4.431111111111111

Buy it if you like Hi-Res 3D and the movie itself.  Note - great 3D and visuals by themselves are not enough - you still must like the movie (plot, performances) for itself! Also Forget the Native vs. Post-Production 3D Conversion arguments - just look for how well the end-result 3D production is (you can have poor 3d in either process)!

*** However, my copy has a freeze-up problem at 17:37 that is within the Blu-Ray media itself (not caused by a physical scratch or defect) that could not be solved with disc cleaning Nor Blu-Ray Player Firmware Update / Cold-Reboots. No recourse for this issue - hope it resolves itself with future Blu-Ray Player Firmware Updates. ***",1356480000,,953,4.704819277108434

The offers in the box have long since expired so don't get excited when you see them. I find, as I found in the theater, that Pt.#1 dragged a little at times. Blesphamy you say? Truth, I say. The relationship between Emma and Ron is awkward to say the least. The relationship between Harry and Jen Weasley is budding (cute). Make no mistake. I don't recommend it for younger children without pre screening by a parent. The last few HP movies are almost HP noir and the amount of violence has increased to a much sharper level. Everyone seems to get ""it"" but Harry. His reactions to situations are somewhat immature, but I'm digressing. The DVD quality is fantastic. Plays well on 1080p. No problems.

The friends end up like nomads, setting out to hunt down Horcruxes instead of going back to their 7th year at Hogwarts; eventually one of them leaves.  However, with help from the foresight of Albus Dumbledore, the trio are well-equipped to face the evils set into place by Voldemort and his followers.

My complaint is that the movie was obviously not filmed in 3D.  The conversion from 2D to 3D has added some depth to many of the scenes, but there are no scenes where anything jumps off the screen at you.  I have Avatar, Green Lantern, Mysterious Island 2, and Journey to the Center of the Earth all in 3D and those movies have numerous excellent scenes where 3D effects are amazing.  There are times in them that makes one want to duck or blink one's eyes.  There are no such scenes in this 3D version of Deathly Hallows 1.

I've seen all the movies on the big screen. And the last few became a required family viewing (Mom, cousins, Aunt, etc). After countless waiting and 7 movies, I was pleased with the movie series. I saw Deathly Hallows Part 2 at my local theaters Thursday opening night at midnight (2nd lifetime movie I saw for opening midnight showing). The movies are brilliant.
As a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed watching these movies countless times.

Harry Potter is a very charming orphaned boy who finds out he can do magic. He then goes to this amazing school called Hogwarts. A school even I wish I could attend to. Harry Potter bless you.

The actors have matured throughout this series. They've developed their skills and really perform well for their audience. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have really done well.

I am glad I got this movie for $15 though it was hard find. Apparently, Amazon has this movie listed twice on Amazon in 3D form, the one at the top of the search list costs over $40 whereas this one costs only $15. The thing is, both include the 3D film, 2D Blu ray, DVD, and a digital copy.

As for the 3D in this film, it is sometimes apparent in a few scenes but its really a blink and you'll miss kind of thing. I adjusted the depth on my blu ray player and it improved the quality a little bit, but not by much. Compared to Part 2, the 3D appears non-existent or at least it doesn't improve upon the movie.

Its worth buying only in the $15 selection. I honestly wouldn't pay more than what you would pay for a regular combo.",1354406400,,863,3.976878612716763

3814444,4,B001UV4XI8,"'The Deathly Hallows - pt 1"" surpassed ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" as my favourite Harry Potter movie.

I know many did not like this movie due to lack of activity, but I disagree.  It's not just ""the camping movie"".  Sure it was a bit more understated, but I thought it also showed off better than the other movies how far Radcliffe, Grint and Watson had come as actors.

Visually, the movie was stunning. The muted tones were nice. The locations were incredible. Let's face it, the animation for the tale of the Deathly Hallows was frickin' awesome. And yes, there was enough action (c'mon, that run through the forest from the Snatchers, filmed on a zipline was great in the theater) to not make the movie as boring as some people seem to think it was.  I loved the Ministry of Magic scene, though the Malfoy Manor scene seemed darker in print version.

I'm not to gripe about some of the minor changes from book to screen - it happened with all of them. Get over it. I liked the tent scene w Harry and Hermione dancing. I think the song choice of Nick Cave's ""O Children"" was brilliant.

Yes, except for the wedding at the Weasley's, there are not many folks in the movie who aren't Harry, Hermione and Ron. There are no Hogwarts crew, but it works.  It was meant to be a solitary (well, solitary x3) journey and it was.

Still. the overall feeling of the movie was isolation, introspection and survival.  The director, location scout and screenwriter covered this nicely - and the actors did a great job of conveying it all.

Nothing is resolved in this movie and I think that also irked people.....but the last few movies were like that as well.  Still, it now ranks as the best Harry Potter film in the series - at least for me.",1347494400,,1729,4.453968253968254

I have great ideas for more if you would creat a future from here.  Loved the whole HP.  Can't wait to get my hands on the HP DH2.  Hermoine could take over the future McGonagil with McGonagil as lead headmistress.  Hagrid, well gee, no one can do another Hagrid.  He is just so cool and can not be reproduced.  But Hagrid and GiAnt could relate with future children as supporting actors and actresses.  Just keep it coming - don't let the storyline end here.  We need good examples of creative energy in film.

Harry Potter, this all powerful wizard was about a powerful was a wet bag at a sand castle competition. So I did not hold out much hope for this film. The film did not let me down. The film is about running and little else. The must frustrating part was the Hermione Granger assault. Hermione Granger, consistently the most powerful, came over as an absolute wimp and just let the assault happen complete with Bonnie Langford's Violet Elizabeth Bott """"I'll thcream and thcream 'till I'm thick""""  The only sad part is the death of Dobby.

3814578,5,B001UV4XI8,"I think today, or possibly even tomorrow, is the official release date for the DVD. But I'd waited long enough already, so when Amazon offered a pre-release reservation, I ordered it.

It may be discounted because this one did not do quite so well at the box office as the earlier films. It's dark, in both senses of the word. But then more people died in ""Half-Blood Prince"" than in this one. Still, the good guys are really up against it now, since the Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron & Hermione don't even try to go to Hogwarts for what would have been their senior year. They have far more important work: finding and destroying the rest of the Horcruxes that will strip Voldemort of his immortality and allow Harry to kill him. In effect, he is killing one part of Voldemort every time he destroys a horcrux. But it's not easy to find them, and not easy to destroy them.

The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects mentioned in ""Tales of Beedle the Bard,"" and I have a copy of that book. They include a wand which is more powerful than any other, the ""Elder Wand,"" which is suffused with dark magic. It is stolen from the former owner by killing him. There is a stone which can bring the dead back to life, but they are not happy being zombies and it goes badly. Finally, there is a cloak of invisibility. In the story, that's the only one that worked out well.

Since this movie is just half of the last book, I wondered where they'd cut it off. I won't do a spoiler, but just say it was a good choice. However, I am now inspired to go back and read the book again, and get a better sense of what was changed and what was left out. I get the distinct impression the first half hour or so has most of the differences.",1336694400,,1756,4.267267267267267

Many of us fans who bought years 1-6 Ultimate Editions have been waiting for the last two movies to release as an Ultimate Edition. All that's been said is that they will release some time in 2012. I've been searching all around for any information, but no luck.

I then see this product ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (Four-Disc Blu-ray Deluxe Edition)"" I think maybe this is the edition I've been looking for! I go into the product details and see it says ""Ultimate Edition."" I think to myself how Amazon has had some shoddy details on other products. They may list DTS HD Master Audio on blu rays as plain old DTS 5.1. They also sometimes list anime as English or Japanese only, but they're really dual audio. I go for it and buy it.

I got the item today. It looks just like the regular Blu Ray copy, but it also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy. The four discs are the movie (blu ray), the movie (dvd), special features, and a bonus disc. And the special lenticular cover is glued onto a basic thick paper sleeve. I should also mention the sleeve had a bar code sticker stuck to it (from Amazon) which covered up the bar code on the blu ray box. The sticker tore apart when I tried to remove it, slightly tearing and leaving pieces of the sticker on the sleeve.

Well, at least I have a copy of the deathly hallows on blu ray. I decided to buy part 2 for super cheap as well. I may just wait for the real ultimate editions to come out...whenever that may be.",1335398400,3,1553,4.275510204081633

As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film.

We have no problem with you making Blu-Ray versions for those format owners... but not when you deliberately discriminate & deny DVD owners from having any extra's as we had on all of the first 6 movies. You purposely denied all extras on our DVD versions for this last movie. Your denying the hundreds of millions of DVD owners the extras & final ultimate edition of the last Harry Potter movie will accomplish nothing & only turn us against Blu-Ray permanently. We will Not be forced into buying blu-ray. No matter how much we like the film series, we won't be blackmailed by greedy Blu-Ray corporate coercion for this final movie.

You made the Harry Potter ultimate edition on movies 1-6 in DVD format. There is no excuse for not completing the set for both parts of movie 7. By trying to coerce us into buying in Blu-Ray by denying the extras we got with movies 1-6 in DVD format, you are only turning us against your overpriced Blu-Ray forever. You might get away with discriminating against DVD owners on this one movie, but Blu-Ray & its parent companies will pay the ultimate price when the hundreds of millions of DVD owners permanently boycott your overpriced products.

Remember HD-DVD? It went down the drain as well. Do your really think we are going to dump the hundreds of DVDs in our collections just for one movie so we can pay 3 times the price for your overrated product just so your corporation can stuff their pockets? Just visit the Blu-Ray aisle any video store & you will rarely see your products move. Those aisles are practically abandoned.

You may have thought you could take advantage of a captive audience of a highly popular movie by using blackmail tactics to coerce millions to convert to your product. All you have succeeded in doing is creating hundreds of millions of DVD owners as enemies who will go out of their way to boycott Blu-Ray & its parent companies in perpetuity.

Creating Blu-Ray versions for those owners is just fine. Make it in both formats. But when you deliberately deny the same product extras to hundreds of millions of DVD owners just to coerce us into converting, that is a petulant, greedy, nasty slight toward 2/3rds of the fans who own DVD's.

3814767,5,B001UV4XI8,"This review is a technical review for two Harry Potter movies:  1)'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XHY) and 2) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XIS).

For Deathly Hallows Part 1, the product details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is ""2.40:1"".  It is not.  According to the Internet Movie Database, the Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1.

On backside of the DVD case for Part 1, it says, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.""  This is incorrect, thank goodness!

The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an Aspect Ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!  Warner Video's use of the words ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"" is probably their way of saying ""anamorphic"".  They should just say, ""Anamorphic.""

A true Letterboxed DVD of this movie would be a 1.33:1 image with a 2.35:1 widescreen image embedded and centered within it.  The movie would have black bars showing above and below.  It could be viewed on an older 1.33:1 TV without distortion.  It could also be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in 1.33:1 (Pillarboxed) Mode without distortion.  Or is could be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in Zoom Mode without horizontal or vertical distortion.  On a widescreen TV, in Full Mode, the image would be distorted and would appear stretched horizontally.

Again, this DVD is in fact *not* Letterboxed.  If you watch this DVD on a 1.33:1 TV, the image is stretched vertically, hence it is anamorphic (which is good for those of us with widescreen TVs).  On a widescreen 1.77:1 TV, you need to watch the DVD in Full Mode to view the movie without distortion.  (Zoom Mode will not work well since the vertically stretched image will simply become bigger and remain vertically stretched.)

For Deathly Hallows Part 2, the Product Details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is ""1.77:1"".  It is not!  The Internet Movie Database tells us that the movie is 2.35:1.

On backside of the DVD case for Part 2, it says, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.""  Again, this is incorrect!

The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!

So, the good news is the DVDs are fine.  Amazon is a bit confused about the correct Aspect Ratios and Warner Video needs to learn the correct definition of 'Letterboxed'.",1330473600,,2622,4.877551020408164

3814774,5,B001UV4XI8,"Nothing much can be added to the hundreds of reviews this DVD has already received but here are a few quick comments.

1. The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.

2. Our three stalwarts, portrayed by Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, are on their own for much of the film with no supporting cast to help carry the load. They all do a fine job. The Potter series was truly fortunate when these three were cast.

3. The film really can't stand on its own nor is it supposed to. It does try to come to a climax of sort and succeeds more or less but no viewer can possibly be satisfied with it. I recommend waiting to watch this until Part 2 is in hand to avoid frustration.

Highly recommended. The Potter series has maintained high standards throughout. This film validates the decision to split the final book into two parts.",1329091200,5,1173,4.318181818181818

3815033,4,B001UV4XI8,"This DVD is excellent, as are all of the Harry Potter Movies. The Only complaint I have
for this and Part Two of this feature is that it is not available in full screen as are
all of the other seven movies to this series. For everyone who has purchased the first
seven DVD's in full screen, it ruins the collection when the last ones are not available
in the same format. A lot of people will end up feeling ripped off, who don't like the
movies in wide screen presentation. I for one am tired of movie collections starting out
giving you a choice, and then ending with only one format available. The spiderman series
did the same thing. The first two were available in both formats, but the third was only
available in widescreen. Then to make matters worse, everytime this happens, it's always
the widescreen with the largest black bars, instead of the small ones, making the picture
even smaller. Even on a big screen TV it's like watching a movie through two slats in a
fence. You'd think if they were only going to offer one aspect ratio, that they would
compromise and use the format with the smallest black bars and largest picture. You'd
also think that if they're going to start a series of movies with a continuing story,
that all of the movies would be released in the same format. I Love the Harry Potter
movies from beginning to end, but I'm certainly not going to re purchase the entire
set just to get them in the same format, no matter how cheap the price. Once I've purchased
a show, I think that should be that. So to the manufacturers of these DVD's which have
numerous sequels, please finish what you start. I feel ripped off everytime you do this.
As for the movie, it was great. These stories were great from beginning to end. Great job
on bringing these stories to film. I highly reccommend all of the Harry Potter movies, but
only wish all eight were available in fullscreen.",1326672000,,1899,4.459770114942529

3815145,4,B001UV4XI8,I bought  these two movies for my 8 year old granddaughter and watched them with her.  We have both read all the books in the series  and loved them.  I always think the books are better but I thoroughly enjoyed the movies.,1326585600,,223,4.238095238095238
3815146,3,B001UV4XI8,"The Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1 DVD takes several minutes to load.  This is rare and unusual since all the other DVD's play immediately. I question whether the disc may be defective;  however, the movie is great.",1326585600,,228,4.675
3815147,3,B001UV4XI8,"I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and my liking of them has increased with each new film that is released. And before I go any further, I should note that I did not read any of the books (except for the first one) before seeing the films. I am much more of a movie fan (obviously) and my philosophy is that if you want to be able to enjoy both the movies and the books, see the movie first.
Now, back to Harry Potter. This film marks the beginning of the end as Harry, Hermione and Ron travel the world looking for horcruxes (evil artifacts containing pieces of Voldemort's soul) and the means to destroy them.
This is my least favorite film in the franchise. It was dark, it was depressing, and it raised more questions than answers. Now, I know that this is supposed to be a two-parter and since the story is only half finished, there will always be lots of questions. But overall, there was very little here to enjoy. Every movie usually has a stunning climax and some really cool magical moments in the film, and this one lacked both. The climax was weak and there wasn't really anything new to see in this film. Nothing that we haven't really seen before. And if we've seen it all before...
I'm sure most of my opinions will change (hopefully) with the viewing of the second part, but until then, I'm not a big fan of this film. Aside from that, the special effects were impressive, the acting was well played, and the story moved smoothly.

As far as questionable content:
The film is dark and there are some scary and violent moments throughout. This is not recommended for younger children.
*Spoiler Alert*
According to the book, In the moment where Ron faces off against the demon within the horcrux, he is given a vision of Harry and Hermione in love and there is a moment where they kiss. In the film, the ""kiss"" became more of a sex scene with Harry and Hermione making out while completely nude. You never see any private parts, but it is a very risky scene. I hated this moment of the film. The naked make-out session was inappropriate, random, and just plain weird. So, just a heads up.

3815148,2,B001UV4XI8,"I love all of the Harry Potter books and movies. However, this is the worst one, mainly because it looks like most of it was filmed in the dark and it is very difficult to see the action going on through most of the film. You can still have dark overtones and still have a few lights on so you can see what's going on. Don't these directors review them before they say ""print""?  What's the point of filming a movie when it looks like it's almost entirely in the dark?  They also changed quite a few things from the book. This was a very disappointing Harry Potter movie.",1326499200,,570,4.220183486238532
3815149,3,B001UV4XI8,"I've seen all the Potter films, and really like the early ones.  Much of what I like about them is the ""magic"" - colorful costumes, magical creatures, Hogwarts (both the setting and the school atmosphere), and John Williams fantastic musical score.  Unfortunately, most of that is missing here.  The kids are on the run, so the whole Hogwarts school setting is absent from this film, and instead they spend most of their time in a drab tent, camping in the drab wilderness, dressed in really drab muggle clothes, in drab lighting (the whole movie seems to take place on an overcast day - don't try watching this when the sun is coming through your windows, or you won't be able to see much of the film!).  Sadly, they don't have John Williams doing the music for this one, and the composer chooses not to utilize Williams's iconic themes from the previous movies, leaving an important connection to the feel of the series out, and the music doesn't do anything to create a magical Harry Potter atmosphere.  Another major part of my enjoyment of the early films was the friendship between the 3 main characters (although there were tensions at times).  In this film, the characters are pretty much uptight the whole film, and their relationships are strained.  Although I understand the significance to the plot, this makes watching the movie more tense than relaxing for me. Also, an important part of the film is to show the frustration and lack of progress of the book - the film succeeds in this enough, but, like my previous criticism, I don't find feeling frustrated and like nothing's getting anywhere to be my idea of ""good entertainment""!
  This is not to say this movie is terrible - just that I find it the least enjoyable of the series - it moves the plot along, and I'd certainly recommend it for someone working the way through the whole series, but I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone viewing experience.  On the bright side, there are plenty of good parts:  the initial scene where Harry leaves the Dursley house, the scene where they sneak into the Ministry of Magic, where they visit the Lovegoods' house, etc.  I guess, wherever they make it look like a magical world I enjoy it - I go to Harry Potter to see something different and magical, not to see the drabbest side of the everyday modern world; I can see that for free!",1326499200,,2348,4.644927536231884

  Hermione (Emma Watson) uses her wand to ""still"" her parents before she leaves.
Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) holds a council meeting of witches and wizards that have turned to his side, which includes, Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter), Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory).
It is discussed Harry Potter must not be harmed in 30 days, the day before his 17th birthday. Snape says it is false. They will go after him next Saturday. The Auror Office can no longer protect him. Professor Snape says Harry will be taken to a safe house, the house of someone in The Order. He will be given every order of protection. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. Voldemort mentions he must be the one to kill Harry Potter, however, their wands are somehow the same. He can wound, but not fatally harm Harry Potter. Voldemort needs a more powerful wand.
  Harry is still saddened by the death of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).
  At the home of the Weasley's, Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) gives Hermione, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Harry each a useful gift according to Dumbledore's Last Will and Testament. However, their is one more gift for Harry Potter. It is the Sword of Gryffindor from the Chamber of Secrets. But Dumbledore had no right to give this gift to Harry. In any case, the Sword is missing.

3815433,4,B001UV4XI8,"I've been reading books, and watching movies adapted to the screen from books, for 65 years, and the entire Harry Potter series stands out as some of the better books, and, along with the Lord of the Rings, one of the best adaptations to the screen, that I have ever seen.  I just bought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and watched it for the 3rd time.  I missed the parts of the books that couldn't be in the movie, because of time constraints, but found the last chapter of Harry's life on screen to be ""believable"" and compelling.

I mourned the loss of characters that have been part of my life since the day I closed the cover on ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", but in movie's, as in life, things don't always turn out the way you would like. As in ""real"" life, in ""reel"" life, people die and we don't always get what we thought we wanted.  This movie brought Harry (and his readers) to a logical end of childhood and the beginning of his 'grown-up' life.

Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for an incredible journey.

I'm such a ""Potter Geek"" that I went to the theatre to see the films when they wre released, and then wnet and bought my down DVD copy.  ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" delivered all fo theaction and special effects I expected and more.  While, I could see some of where the story was going, I must admit, I was surprised a number of times.  The actors have evolved beautifully into their roles in these films and the they do not disappoint in ""Deathly Hallows"" Part 1.  I've of course already bought ""Deathly Hallows"" Part 2, but that's another story.  Suffice it to say, the Harry Potter story is a super piece of work.  I don't recommend it for little ones, although it might be fun at first, as most know it grows darker as the series progresses.  So...now onto the books!!!

In terms of the copy I received from Amazon, again I have yet to be disappointed.  Always a good and fair price, always good service, always pristine quality.",1324598400,,1002,4.486187845303867

3815545,4,B001UV4XI8,"The film itself was much much better watching it again after watching Deathly Hallows Part 2. The first time I watched this as a rental before Pt 2 was out I was not impressed, thought it was the least dynamic and interesting of the Potter films - kind of dull and flat, lack of plot elements as well as ""new scenery"" of the world created by Rowling. This is probably why it's so inexpensive even on blue ray. I must say I enjoy it more now on re-run.

Bought this and Part 2 because of the upcoming ""blackout"" on Potter DVDs/broadcasts/streaming availability that is going to happen in 2012 and will last until Warner Bros. releases the new box set some time in 2012 or possibly even 2013. I do like to have Harry Potter ""marathon weekends"" on my own time, especially holed up during snowstorms and since I have all the other movies I didn't want to wait for the box set to watch the whole saga when I want to. And of course if the box set does not provide extended versions of these films with ample extra footage in all of them in my opinion it will be pointless to have since I'm not a collector but watch for ""entertainment value"".",1324339200,,1136,4.308411214953271
3815606,5,B001UV4XI8,"I know I'm in the minority when it comes to Deathly Hallows pt. 1 because many don't like its pacing but I do.  I love the fact that Harry, Ron and Hermione are off on their own, a quest for the horcruxs, a sort of twisted road trip capped off with a brilliant animated sequence telling the tale of the 3 brothers and the deathly hallows.  Also, Voldimort is in truly wicked form as evil has descended on the wizarding world.  It stands alone as a great addition to the Harry Potter franchise and of course sets up the grand finally of part 2 and grand is an understatement!  I like watching parts 1&2 back to back...good times!",1324252800,,628,4.296610169491525
3815607,5,B001UV4XI8,"Finally, the moviemakers behind the Harry Potter films did the right thing and broke up a book into two movies, something that should have been done from the very first book.  Given that, this is still a long movie, clocking in at almost 2.5 hours, without any additional footage separate from the theatrical release.  This film is part action, part suspense, part drama, with a little comedy and romance thrown in.  There is magic, but not so much of it as to overwhelm the plot lines, of which there are several.  First is the quest of Harry and friends to find the Deathly Hollows.  Second is the relationship between Ron and Harry both over Hermione and with regards to each other.  Then comes the separate tragedies of the various wizards and muggles as they fall prey to Voldermort.  Last, but not least, is Voldermort himself, and his quest to find Harry Potter.  Mixed in is a very original and effective retelling of the Deathly Hallows story narrated by Hermione, some key deaths, and further insights into Dumbeldorf's past.  Overall, a great movie and well worth the purchase, especially considering the news that Warner Brothers will remove all the Potter DVD's from store shelfs early 2012.",1324252800,,1204,4.8341463414634145

SPOILER!!!! SPOILER!!!SPOILER!!! If you do NOT know what happens, PLEASE STOP NOW!!!!!

Everything you thought about Snape? Well, you were wrong (personally, I saw that coming). Dumbledor was more of a finagler that you EVER thought, even in death. The bad guys get there's BIG TIME. Harry has kids who go to Hogwarts 19 years after the end of the film.

Okay, now to MY review. I know almost everyone knows what happens in this dvd by now. I am 58, and a huge fan of this series. Deathly Hallows 1 was a very very dark set-up to finish with DH 2. The CG effects in DH2 are way better than any of the other films. There is not ONE moment that doesn't have you on the edge of your seat/couch. The filming is dark when it needs to be, and bright when it should be. The characters are no longer young kids, they have arrived into adults, and play that role. The soundtrack...excellent. Subdued and used purely to accent the action. While the plot takes you to the inevitable end, you find yourself embracing it, and, even though it is the end of this fantastic series, accepting. You will bury your face in your hands at the sad parts (yes, I may have shed a few tears), but shout cheers at you tv for the victories. And after all, isn't that WHY we watch this series? My ONLY sorrow, is there isn't more. The world created in this series is a very special world. And I will miss it.

3815883,4,B001UV4XI8,"These hallows are not only ""deathly,"" they're ""darker than dark.""

Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.

Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.

Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.

The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Voldemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.

Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.",1322784000,,1959,4.924242424242424

3815885,5,B001UV4XI8,"Well, I will begin this interview by saying, 'whats NOT to say about this charming, coming of age tale of wonder, wizadry, and groovy groovy times!' Lol.

I'll begin by commenting about the cover...you are drawn into the movie from the get go when you see this cover, like all good covers should do to you.
what do we see? we see three trainee-wizards, each with a magic wand and one a girl called hermione, running through a wood. Harry Potter, the main character,wears something of a fearful expression on his handsome, slightly nerdy features, his eyes sleepy behind his infamous lenses. Ronald takes up the rear, also looking doubtful, as they sprint towards their destination. But little hermione,striding calmly at H.Potter's shoulder...there is a glint in her eye. The wand is like a sparkler in her gloved hand and her eyes are bright with purpose.

And it is this sparkle, this explosion of destiny behind those dark, calm eyes, that is more or less the key to not just this Harry Potter movie, but every HP movie and indeed the whole philosophy and ethic of the shimmery, effervescent Rowling-conceived Universe.

And now for the movie itself...well, its good. 'Harry Potter 2' good. Not since I first saw the little goblin guy Dobby that they're friends with with the funny voice (Dobby) has my faith in this wonderful wonderful franchise felt so strong, to see this beautifully misunderstood creature return in such a moving way.

Although Harry Potter is my favourite fictional character of all time, I shall stick my two hands up at this stage in the interview and admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Harry Potter stories:I've never read the books...(it's my firm decision to never read any books that have been adapted into films; they spoil the films because they're always way better (read 'Jaws' by Peter Benchley for a fruitful example of this)) so naturally Im not a massive admirer of the movie adaptations, but this was hands down my favourite of the 7.

Having watched the Potter franchise develop from when I was a kid to now, I feel like I have grown up with my three good friends, Harry, Ronald Weasley and Hermione...

Things I had not noticed in the theater almost jumped out when viewing it at home.  The quality was excellent even in the DVD format (until I get a new blu-ray player I will have to wait for the ""blu-ray"" experience)
  As far as the movie itself goes I recommend not even watching this one UNLESS you have Part 2 in hand.  The desire to complete the story is stronger than the desire to start a new movie the previous parts (1-6) left the viewer with.
  If it's been a while since you have viewed the other parts in this series the first thing that presents itself is how much these characters have aged and then how much they have, and have not, changed emotionally and mentally.  Three 17 year old kids off on a lark they are not and the uncertainty, doubt and fear they experience can be seen and, at times, even felt.",1322438400,,975,4.255434782608695

It seems that this was just a rush conversion by the producers to make money, rather than a strong effort to have a good quality conversion. Part 2 is great, but it was converted and had to face criticism in theaters so faced a greater need for higher quality.

So is it worth it? For the average consumer, I would say no. However, as such a major fan I feel the need to own a copy of the 3d bluray package, so I don't realyl regret buying it. Still, I'm disippointed.",1322265600,4,745,4.033783783783784

The quality of the in screen 3D is about the same as watching a 2D version and just letting your TV do the conversion to 3D. Even among the post-production (FAKE) 3D films, this one ranks below average.

 MY 3D RATING = FAIR (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

I'm very glad they decided to spend the money and the time to make it two movies and do it right.

Goblet of Fire will always remain my favorite story line, but this one has to be a close second, and I thought it was done very well.  I particularly liked the animation of the story of the Deathly Hallows as Hermione is reading it; very creative.  As always, I thought most of the acting was great, and the special effects were fantastic.  As a fan of both the books and the movies, it is hard to come up with much negative to say.

--------------------------
Hello,

  We have researched your issue and this Digital Copy offer has expired. The Digital Copy offer is intended to be available only for a limited time following the initial release of the DVD and/or Blu-ray Disc. The expiration date is specifically stated on (a) the outside packaging of your DVD or Blu-ray disc, (b) the insert, (c) the Digital Copy disc, and/or (d) the redemption site.

I'm fairly incensed by this lack of ""caring"" by WB.  In essence, this is gross misrepresentation by WB and its retailers to continue to sell the combo pack when part of the ""combo"" no longer works.  It should have been re-labeled or pulled from the shelves on September 13th.  Expecting customers to notice the fine print is absolutely asinine...especially for people who have purchased theirs online.  Amazon.com customers are none the wiser unless they scour the reviews.

For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome.  This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.

I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray. Before Blu Ray was released they managed to give us just as many special features on DVDs and now since Blu Ray at least to me is nothing but a space saver the film industry is literally taking a massive dump on DVDs.

that being said, I do think the writing of the screen play and the directing did accomplish a very good purpose in that it set well the stage for the final half of the book. The build-up was profound in a subtle way and I admit that I am looking forward to the finale.

The acting was mature and superb. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert have developed into actors who have the ability to truly flesh out their characters very well. they are believable.

3816383,5,B001UV4XI8,"I wasn't a fan of the previous Harry Potter film because it was extremely shy on the actual magic and didn't contain enough action for my liking, but Deathly Hallows is a pretty remarkable improvement on *both* accounts.  To me the magical aspect of the Harry Potter series is a vital addition to the storytelling.  It really enhances the feeling of adventure.  I'm happy to report that it's back again, thankfully.

As expected by the title of the film alone, it's about Lord Voldemort attempting to officially capture and rid the world of Harry Potter once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's definitely not for me to spoil, hehe.

The setting is quite the surprise as well.  Harry Potter and his friends almost never step foot inside a castle which makes the movie feel different, but not in a distracting kind of way or anything.  Most of the adventure takes places outside in the empty forests or occasionally in the city streets.  A major part of the storyline is on Harry Potter and the gang being cloned into lookalike Harry Potter's and being able to disappear whenever signs of danger present themselves (which is pretty much the norm by this point but used to great effect this time around).

Some of my favorite scenes are when Harry Potter was outside in the dark woods by himself and he spots a glowing, mystical deer walking around.  To me this was a *beautiful* moment of creativity.  Another really fascinating and bizarre moment of viewing material (and storytelling for that matter) came later when the story surrounding Death takes place and how Death tricks people into being loyal through conniving ways.  It's actually a very interesting story and even someone like me who normally daydreams through such moments was paying close attention and enjoying it.  Good writing.

Overall, great acting by all the characters like always, beautiful sceneries, magical superpowers dominate, good suspense and storyline development come together to create an entertaining chapter in the Harry Potter films.",1318118400,,2021,4.970238095238095

3816448,2,B001UV4XI8,"For me, this was an odd movie.

First, it was dark.  Almost every scene was either dark blue or dark brown, with only glimpses of sun.

I realize this is thematic, and symbolizes the dark, almost impossible predicament, the three principals (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are in.

Second, it almost entirely lacked the interesting subordinate characters that made the previous Harry Potters so lively: Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Luna, the Malfoys, the rest of the Weasleys, etc., etc. do appear, but briefly--then they are gone.

Also thematic, I realize: the isolation and loneliness are deliberately claustrophobic, and intensify the fears and hopelessness of the Big 3.

Still, these give the film a closed-in, deprived feel, that, however thematic, make it seem thin and strained.

Third, the wedding is given short shrift, while the jealousy-theme goes on interminably.

Also thematic, I know: this is the story of growing up, and all the melodrama and angst of being a teenager.

Still, all this indicates that the Epic Good-vs.-Evil conflict has taken over the movie, at the expense of everything else.

The whimsy, the craziness, the unexpected twists, the fun settings (like Hogwarts and even Harry's horrible foster-family),and the humor are all gone.

I suppose this was all deliberate, but it makes for grim watching.",1316908800,2,1324,5.257142857142857

3816529,5,B001UV4XI8,"For starters let me be clear! I am a hard core 'Potter' aficionado who knows everything about the saga like I know my own palm....BUT...I'm not the fan that says: ""Oh they changed that!"" and ""They did that wrong!"" for one and only reason: Books and films are different; they target a somewhat different audience and have different views. And more importantly sth that is good on page doesn't mean that it will look good on screen. Take comic-book heroes' funky costumes for example.
So entering the next-to-last 'Potter' film I will say that it is phenomenal! It has heart, character development, scenes to get teary or even cry about, special effects and -being the first part of the finale- sets up the pace for the last 'Potter' outing, perfectly.
I am one person that will say what the producers and writer did RIGHT with the changes they made and support WHY they made them. [spoiler ALERT]
A) They added the actual scene that Hermione took the memories of her from her parents.
In a teary prologue-for-the-finale scene that shows what the trio is up to, preparing for their journey of finding and destroying Voldemort's horcruxes (which are bits of Voldemort's soul and the key of his immortality), Hermione takes away all memories of her, from her parents to protect them. The score in this scene is excellent and a teary Hermione looks around the living room as she fades away from all the family photos. So emotional. And her leaving alone her house while crying before the logo is revealed. Wow! It is the end.
B) Death of Hedwig
It was a somewhat small dissapointment I had from Jo's excellent book that Hedwig that made such an impression as an owl and with the famous ""Hedwig's theme"" to have such a 'collateral damage' death. So I liked they made her die like a hero ttrying to save Harry from a deatheater and thus making it the reason why Voldemort realises who is the real Harry. Great, great scene!
C) Harry and Ginny's seperation
While I admire Harry's bravery and heroism as he will be forever my childhood hero I found lame and predictable that he broke up with Ginny at the end of 'Half-Blood Prince' book to protect her. I like more that they got seperated because of the circumstances now that the trio is hunted...
D) Dobby
Since they had not included Dobby in the previous films I found very logical his reappearence in Diagon Alley as he is now free to go wherever he wants.
E) Harry and Hermione dancing
In a newly added scene Harry and Hermione are dancing to 'O' Children' by Nick Cave. There was a lot of debait with this scene as some of the fans found that it had a romantic subtext. NO! It's one of the most beautifully written scenes ever. Harry and Hermione shared a friendship different that his and Ron's and now alone, he wanted to cheer her up. They are children that are going through things that children who are 17 years old shouldn't so the song is spot on. The scene is excellent.

The acting is stop-notch and especially in this film that the grown-up cast is not so much around the young cast is shining truly! Emma Watson is incredible and steals almost everyone's thunder! Oh and there is a certain animation scene that really is like it's gotten out of a dream! This is a magical film, I totally recomend it and I can't wait to enjoy 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' in my TV screen!

The pacing is leisurely, sometimes TOO leisurely, but the emotion is intense and there's a real sense of danger and crisis. The action sequences are explosive and scary, and some of the ""on the road"" scenes are breathlessly beautiful. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all push their acting envelopes. Best moments: a heartbreaking dance between Harry and Hermione, the Godric's Hollow sequence, and the pursuit by the Snatchers. I wish director Yates had varied the blue-gray palette, but if you bring patience to the viewing, you'll have a rich experience.

The Blu-Ray transfer looks good, and I was relieved to invoke English subtitles so I could comprehend what the characters were saying. Over the past decade, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have gone from speaking in crystalline British syllables to mumbling unintelligibly.

The extras follow the tradition of all the Potter DVDs--they're crap. Well, except for the Maximum Movie Mode version of the film, with many pop-ups and mini-documentaries. That's interesting. ""The Seven Harrys,"" showing how this special effect was accomplished, COULD have been informative but it's so quick and raggedly cut that it's of no help. ""On the green with Rupert, Tom, Oliver, and James"" features a quartet of Potter actors playing a round of golf and reminiscing about the series. Not enlightening (and you REALLY need the subtitles for this!). ""Dan, Rupert, and Emma's running competition"" is a one or two minute featurette about Dan, Rupert and Emma trying to outrun each other during the Snatchers scene. Useless. No commentary track from director, actors, or anyone else. The Parnassus of DVD docs remains those on the Lord of the Rings packages.",1313366400,,1808,5.167235494880546

3816705,4,B001UV4XI8,"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!

Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.

Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)

I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.

That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.

Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing.",1313280000,,1618,4.683098591549296

Yes, the kids in the movie are no longer kids and the movie does attempt to show the angst, temptations, jealousies, etc.... of teens BUT the movie is still a bore.  Maybe in the theaters it was better, but on TV, scenes look too dark and the special effects don't look too special.  As for character developments and acting - well the actors try do the best with the material but there is nothing noteworthy in any of their scenes and everything drags right up to the final scene.

However, in the Blu-Ray transfer there's an abboration in the anamorphic lens used to make the transfer that causes the image to be non-square and a light bar to appear running down the left side of the image, approximately 20% of the way into the image, that appears and disappears approximately every fifteen minutes.  On any sort of good viewing equipment this is noticable and highly distracting.

The audio, on the other hand, is a superb mix, possibly one of the best I've ever heard, with more detail than was available in the theatrical release thanks to the additional bandwidth available on a Blu-Ray disc compared to the DD/DTS/SDDS tracks on the film print.

Overall, although this is a great film, this review only receives two stars because for such a major release Warner Brothers should have double checked the digital transfer from film, and it's clear that they didn't.",1311206400,,986,4.851190476190476

There is none of the above.
All it is is trans-spiritual gobble-guck rife with hordrometts and gizzle-wigkets, dolp-grommets, bing-slammits and wands that can do anything including creating flowers on graves.
This is the worst movie that was ever so-called created for children. It is a false spiritual odyssey.
The next door youngster when asked if he had seen it said: ""It's goofy! I don't like that.""
This is a massive exploitation of the American and other publics' inability to not ""be with it!"" There is no plot, there is no single thing to draw and keep your attention and it is so dark, dank and depressing because it is so completely absurd.
To enjoy and appreciate anything there must be some sort of theme or idea that catches the imagination and leads it and you through the adventure.

3816798,4,B001UV4XI8,"When I say this film is dark, I don't mean in its visual presentation, which is superb. The cinematography and special effects are top notch. But much like ""Half Blood Prince"", DH Part 1 has very little of the delight and joy which were evident in the early books and movies. Yes, those stories had the dark elements associated with Voldemort and in the dangerous seeming climaxes, but other parts of the stories were highly entertaining and uplifting in their depiction of life at Hogwarts. Harry's problems with his aunt, uncle, and cousin were played for laughs. Classroom scenes were at time frustrating, and at times funny, but always interesting.

At some point in this process JK Rowling lost the wonder of her early books, and began to see herself as a SERIOUS WRITER OF DRAMA. At that point all the fun drained out of her stories. I have finished them merely to finish them, not because I really had fun with the last books, or these last three movies. DH Part 1 is a lot like ""The Dark Knight"" in that the movie is expertly crafted, but just gives the viewer very little hang onto in terms of tension breaks. I think this is a big mistake for any movie. The goal of a movie such as this should be to entertain the audience, not exhaust them. I'll have no problem re-watching the first five movies at times, but I seriously doubt there will be ANY repeat viewings of the final three movies for me. Just as even though I'm a big time Batman fan, I've had absolutely no desire to watch ""The Dark Knight"" a second time. Unrelenting tension and misery for the main characters isn't my thing. I get enough of that just running a business. LOL

So if you have read all the books and watched the first six films, certainly there is no way you are going to miss this one, or the conclusion. You have too much invested in the story over the years, just as we do. You will be impressed at the special effects, which are so natural to this vision of a magical society by now that you will forget that they ARE special effects. You'll be uplifted at our heroes' little victories, and sad at the tragedies which befall them. If you're like me, in the end you may also feel a bit empty, because the charm and joy which the first books and movies in this series promised is long gone by the stark and depressing tone of its ending.",1310947200,,2325,4.392111368909513
3816799,4,B001UV4XI8,"This film adaptation to the first segment of JK Rowling's final Harry Potter book was acceptable. The imagery and film quality greatly make up for the flawed story line that was strewed together by the film writers. Characters are consistent from one film to the next, and therefore cannot be discredited for their out-of-place appearances later in the series. Realizing that film is a much different medium to tell a story, the point of the films is really to admire the beauty of the world Jo made for us. Thank you.

However, this movie is far from a 5-star rating. The ending was rather anti-climactic. I was severely disappointed with the closing scene. The viewer was left without any ""what next?"" left in their mind, and instead were left with a sequence unrelated to what the lead characters must do from their previous predicaments.

If you've read the books, this movie ends at the conclusion of chapter 24, yet about 2-3 pages before the actual end to that chapter.

I'm extremely glad that I did not see this movie in theaters... otherwise, I would have been sorely disappointed and not really given to wait another year or two for the conclusion... Especially when now there is such great anticipation that it might not be surmountable.

3816801,5,B001UV4XI8,"2010's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the beginning of the end for this franchise, which began nine years ago with the cinematic adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must admit that while I'm a Harry Potter fan, I'm not quite a Harry Potter fanboy. I read the first five books and enjoyed them immensely, but didn't read the last two. It's no fault of the series that I neglected to do so, merely my lack of drive to do so. I have seen all six of the previous films, each in the year of their release and only once. I know that Harry Potter fans can be hard to please, especially when it comes to Hollywood adapting their sacred text. It seems no matter how faithful the screenwriters stick to the story, there is always room for error here. With that in mind, I am only at liberty to discuss this as a standalone film; not bothering to compare it to the previous films nor discuss how it differs from the novels. What I can tell you, and it should come as no surprise, is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 functions as a film in context with the other books/movies. If you have not seen any of the previous films, don't bother seeing this one. If you've skipped a couple films or a couple books, but are familiar enough with the ones you've skipped, you may find this film mostly enjoyable...But I recommend having as much knowledge as possible before watching this; I admit even I was unable to catch a few references throughout.

In describing the plot, not that the plot or anyone involved in it need introduction, I'll be careful not to offend the spoiler police. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gaining power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in far greater danger than he ever imagined. With Voldemort in constant pursuit of him, Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must locate the remaining Horcruxes (powerful objects in which Voldemort has hidden fragments of his soul) in order to eventually destroy the Dark Lord.

The excitement level of this entry rarely lets up and the film is very fast paced, but what's remarkable is that there's an actual plot behind the action and part one isn't just an introduction to the epic battle that will likely take place in part two. While most Hollywood productions begin to drone on and get lazy by the second installment (sometimes after a lazy first installment), the Harry Potter films, seven films in, continues to thrive and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 may be one of the strongest entries in the series. I can say without a doubt that it's better than the sixth film.

This film is such a strong entry in part because it works on levels of story, adventure, character, and plot. I initially found the decision to split the book into two films a way for the studio to milk this franchise for every last dime, but I concede that this was a great idea. It allows the filmmakers to finish this tale without sacrificing any of the necessary elements that have made people embrace these films. Here is a film, a Hollywood blockbuster no less that moves at a fast-pace yet continues to move, un-rushed, through the plot and develop its characters further. I think it's hard to deny the effect of a film when it elicits sympathy over an elf. Yes, for a movie about witchcraft and wizardry, there's a surprising amount of effective emotional cues throughout.

All of the actors who have worked tirelessly for the last decade have really blossomed in their roles, particularly the three leads: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. They've grown into these characters and are completely convincing. Any doubt about their casting should be brushed away if it hasn't been already. Fiennes' performance as Voldemort is a particularly impressive feat, especially when one considers that the wrong actor could come off as completely ridiculous in this role. There's a lot of makeup and CGI involved in the physical creation of Voldemort and yet Fiennes makes him wholly believable and appropriately menacing. His performance is wonderfully realized, as Voldemort does come off as an incarnation of evil without becoming a computer-generated joke. Fiennes also adds a certain amount of pathos that I think few actors could muster. In addition, the actors all share a chemistry and on-screen bond that can only be acquired from knowing and working with their group for many years. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing best friends for ten years and they're a believable group. Most of the 145 minutes of part one focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's quest to find the Horcrux, leaving little room for other actors to really strut their stuff; but Alan Rickman (as Snape) continues to stand out as memorable, even with little screentime. Meanwhile, Dobby (played, in voice, by Toby Jones), the memorable house-elf, is adorable, making for effective comedic relief and lending the film one of its most surprisingly emotional moments.

In addition to these various elements related to story, one can't ignore the high production value of this film. Yes, it has plenty of CGI (lending perfectly to the mystical aspect of the series), but it's also beautifully rendered with the world of the books lovingly recreated. Ten people are credited with various aspects of set design, production design, and art direction and their efforts set the movie-world of Harry Potter apart from everything else. Meanwhile, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra looks absolutely majestic.

The Harry Potter films rarely get enough credit. Despite being extremely well-made, high-grossing films based on a beloved series of novels they're mostly grouped into the category of simple Hollywood blockbusters. While the previous entries in the series only exist in my mind as vague memories, I can say from this film and those small recollections of the previous films that these are high-quality films that deserve more attention than they've received. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a fine film; an emotional, entertaining, and all-around terrific set-up for part two. It's a film that long-time fans of Harry Potter will not want to miss and new fans will want to get through the others to watch as soon as possible. It's worth the wait.

Or SOMETHING kinda like that, I can not seem to find it in the book now, but it was far more moving than the movie version.

I am going to scribble on my scar with purple sharpie [ Dead center of my skull right between my eyes as JK intended.] Put on my round glasses, my black cape grab my wand and off to the final film. I MAY review it but who cares we have all read the book anyway.",1310860800,,892,3.8579234972677594
3816803,2,B001UV4XI8,"Kudos to those of you who haven't read the book and were still able to follow this story! I read Deathly Hallows when it first came out but didn't remember much of it, and the movie did little to refresh my memory.

Unfortunately, I rented it online, so there were no subtitles that would have helped me at least follow the fast, oftentimes whispered, mumbled or hissed dialogue. But even with subtitles, I doubt that the story would have been less confusing or more interesting.

The flashback scenes (or whatever they were) were so fast and so short that most of them didn't make sense to me.

The ""guards"" (or whatever they were) at the Ministry of Magic wore uniforms that were clearly inspired by the SS. Everybody else seemed to be in Muggle clothes. Why was nobody wearing robes? Wouldn't that have been part of Voldemort's cultural purification program?

Why were Harry, Hermione and Ron Apparating around the country? What were they trying to accomplish? Did they think they would stumble across a Horcrux in the middle of a forest?

What was up with that Bathilda Bagshot character at Godric's Hollow? Did she talk to Harry in Parseltongue? Shouldn't that have raised a red flag? Why was there no discussion between Harry and Hermione after Mrs. Bagshot turned into Nagini?

I'm assuming the locket they were trying to destroy was Salazar Slytherin's, but was it ever explained in the movie?

Why did Gryffindor's sword appear at the bottom of a lake, of all places? In the middle of winter, at that!

What was the deal with the shining doe that led Harry to the sword? Who (or what) was it and where did it come from?

Why did the friends not Apparate to safety when they were pursued by the bad guys (no idea who they were) in the forest?

On a general note: 99% of the movie took place in poorly lit locations or at night, and I found the perpetual gloom annoying.

The online video quality is not very good. We tried to watch it on our plasma TV but the picture was blurry and blotchy, and we couldn't figure out how to improve the resolution. It looked okay on my computer monitor, though.",1310860800,2,2104,4.554376657824934
3816814,2,B001UV4XI8,"Is there anyone else out there that has this nagging thought in the back of their mind, ""Where have I seen this before?"" Then it hits you, you've been watching, ""The Son of the Revenge of the Return of The X-Men Part XXVI, The Next to the last Final Chapter."" Let's do the rundown, Good Wizards/Mutants over here, Bad Wizards/Mutants on the other side. Kindly, Good & Wise leader of the Good Wizards/Mutants is killed by the Bad Wizards/Mutants. The Bad Wizards/Mutants start a campaign against the poor Muggle's/Normal Humans. The Good Wizards/Mutants must stop this evil act. I can't go on.

Now here is the kicker, I probably would not have noticed the similarities if this movie hadn't been so poorly made. HP & TDH is by far the worst of the series so far.  What little dialog was present in the movie was very choppy and forced. The best actor in this installment was the CG Snake. The pace of the movie went from so boring that my eyes started to bleed, (how many times do we have to do the camping thing?), to disjointed and choppy warp speed. The majority of the scenes in this movie did not flow together well at all. They were more like someone unloading a delivery truck, first scene ""bang"" on the loading dock, second scene ""bang"", stacked on top, third scene ""bang"", you get my drift? Maybe a better term would be cookie cuttered?

Now for the DVD itself, Far too much compression. There were times that I thought that Hermione was about 7 feet tall and 125 pounds. Several of the shots of Harry's face were very distorted. The DVD was also so dark most of the time that it was very difficult to watch. On the plus side this movie did not have the huge volume swings that many modern movies have. The sound level was consistently reasonable throughout the film.

All & all, this movie is a must see only because you must see it before part 2. The worst of the movies in the series. If you're a fan, (as I am), you will buy it for your collection but you will seldom re-watch it.

3816815,4,B001UV4XI8,"I am so glad I did not write a review for this movie until now.  In all honesty I did not like the Deathly Hallows part 1 as well as I did the rest of the series.  But over time it grew on me, and I can watch it.  But it would not have earned a 4 star rating if not for the fact that I just saw Deathly Hallows part 2.  Anything I would have stated negatively about part 1 was erased immediately.  The producers of the film had no choice but to split the story in two parts.  At first I thought it was for the money, but that is not the case.  Sure there is about 30 minutes of this movie, I thought was a waste of film stock, so it could have been made a little shorter and still had the same impact.  However, overall for fans of the books (which I have never read); this was the only way for the movie to go.

Now for the part I really wanted to write about.  If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 2, go see it!!!!  It is (in my opinion) the best movie of the entire series!  I knew quite a bit about it from reading snippets of the books from various sites, but never realized how great the story actually was.  What surprises me even more is that I was not at first a fan of the series.  The first film I found a little too childish. The second one was better, but then again it was still a bit childish for my taste. However, as the series progressed, I will say this is a must own series for anyone.  In fact (like Star Trek, and soon like Star Wars) I plan to own these movies on both DVD and Blu Ray so that the films can be watched in different rooms that might not be equipped with a Blu Ray player.

I will not go into this review any further due to the amount of secrets this film and it's sequel reveal.  After seeing the latest one, and this one back to back, I think I will have to go back and rewatch the entire series in order again.  This movie and the newest one is the perfect ending for an excellent story.

Enough said.  Just buy it, it is worth it.",1310688000,,1976,3.8925
3816816,2,B001UV4XI8,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" is the worst of the Potter films, by far.  The story is meandering and pointless, the look of the film is dreary, and the acting not especially good.  Admittedly, the movie attempts to recreate a very large book, showing only the first half of the book in this film, which is a big part of the problem - the movie has no ending, no climax, no closure, and no point.  Perhaps Part 2 will be better, but my advice is to read the books and skip the films, which are just a feeble reflection of the stories.",1310688000,11,550,4.219047619047619
3816817,4,B001UV4XI8,"I liked this film.  I disagree with just about all of the criticisms I've read.  It is NOT too slow.  It is NOT too depressing.  It is NOT boring.  What it is, is a reasonably faithful translation to screen of what Ms. Rowling wrote (unlike with the case of The Half-Blood Prince).  And what she wrote was a grimly realistic depiction of a harrowing journey to the ""dark side"" of a Nazi-like fascist nightmare society and what it would it be like to be outlaws on the run from such a state.  I was deeply moved when I read the book of just how isolating and demoralizing being in such a situation can be, and on top of that, we have Harry's descent into doubt and self-recriminations, especially focusing on his relationship with Dumbledore, which he gradually realizes is not what he thought it was, as he comes to see that Dumbledore himself wasn't who he thought he was.

The testing of the bonds of friendship is a very important part of this story and I thought the film did a very good job of exploring that theme.

So why only 4 stars?  Because once again, as with the Half-Blood Prince, the DVD I bought is way too dark.  This simply cannot be intentional. There are times when I can't see anything at all happening on the screen.  After making all allowances for the fact that much of the story does take place at nighttime, in the dark, you still want to have the screen lit well enough so that a viewer can see what's going on.  The artistry is wasted if it can't be seen.  This impacted my enjoyment of the DVD.  Therefore, only 4 stars.",1310601600,,1549,4.348432055749129
3816818,1,B001UV4XI8,"Many reviewers complain about the darkness of the picture quality which I soundly second.  However, this has been a problem with the last few Potter DVDs we have purchased, not to mention an increasing graininess of the overall picture quality, so I began to assume this was the look the director was going for.  So while it has been quite difficult to make out what is going on in some of the scenes, my primary complaint with this DVD has been that the fast action/fight scenes freeze and unfreeze throughout the action resulting in a very jerky effect.  The chase through the woods is not fun to watch given the way in which the scene was shot coupled with this freeze/unfreeze movement. When this occurred with a video rented from Netflicks, I thought we had a well used video.  Just bought our own copy from Best Buy yesterday and the problem seems even worse.  A number of reviewers point to WB making cheap film to dvd transfer in an effort to ""force"" consumers to switch to blu-ray technology.  Oddly enough this seems plausible and I plan on making a complaint to the FTC, not to mention probably not buying Deathly Hallows II.",1310601600,7,1136,4.599009900990099

While the HB Prince and Order P were a bit of a blur, this film is completely distinctive - it doesn't take place in HogW and is a running adventure chase in full, with many principal characters killed off.  It moves much faster, the dangers seem far greater, and everything is at stake.  This is even character development, with Ron rebelling and coming back, the progress of young love, and Harry's flaws coming out more clearly.  After so much time, it amazes me that the quality is still going up.  The comic touches, depth of theme, and fine acting continue, of course.

3816836,5,B001UV4XI8,"Before getting around to watching this film, I'd heard a lot of mixed things from various friends and online critics. They were saying that the film dragged in places, was filled with pointless parts that amount to nothing, and that if someone hadn't read the books, they'd be completely confused as to what was happening. Most the hardcore Harry Potter fans said it was a great representation of the book. . . so while first sliding the Blu-Ray disc into my Playstation 3, there was a sense of apprehension. 'The Deathly Hallows' as a book, while good, has its problems. What if the film turned out to compound those problems instead of solve them? Many film adaptations have a tendancy toward that.

Another thing that bothered me before I'd even watched it, was why did they have to split this into two films? They produced a great film adaptation of 'The Order of the Phoenix', and that book is packed with way more content than DH. The popular answer was that WB could milk the cash cow. But come on. . . all the Harry Potter films could have benefited from being split into two parts. At least DH will be covering more area than the others were allowed.

Now that I have watched the film, I cannot say that I was ""pleasantly surprised"". . . associating the word ""pleasant"" with DH seems wrong, given how unforgivingly dark this story is. Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a puppy in comparison (a puppy that bites your ankles, but a puppy nonetheless). But I will say that everything taken into account, DH is a damn decent experience.

The first scene gives us a revealing look at Voldemort and the Death Eaters, as they all sit around a table to discuss their progress of universal domination. Most interesting is that Severus Snape takes part in this meeting; even after killing Dumbledore in the last installment, you as the viewer will still suspect that there was more to that situation than meets the eye. Snape is a complex person. It's too bad that Alan Rickman had next to nothing to do in Part I, but it's always a good diversion to look at the character and wonder what's going on inside his head (Rickman typically plays Snape very stoic and collected, unless the scene calls for something else). Luckily, you'll be treated to a lot of the character's backstory in Part II; that is, if they keep true to the novel, which in this case they -really- need to do.

The gears begin to turn fast as we see Hermione wipe her parents' memories of their daughter, along with any indication inside of their home that she ever existed (photos of her fade into non-existence). Elsewhere, Harry stands outside 4 Privet Drive and watches the Dursleys as they hastily leave with only a few seconds of screen time (you don't hear me complaining). The film moves very fast from here until the camping scenes. If you want some time to take a breather, you'll have to wait a while.

We follow our trio on a quest that's destination seems impossible to reach, both to them and we the viewers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to find the horcruxes in order to stop Voldemort from ever reincarnating, but at the same time they have to evade the countless Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers that have infiltrated both the basic wizarding world and the Ministry of Magic itself. They all have strong doubts that their mission can ever be successful. You'll feel that doubt along with them, because this film is filled with introspective moments and rising tensions: Harry is determined, but at the same time jaded and lost. You can hear it in Daniel Radcliffe's voice, see it in his eyes. Hermione is devoted to helping the cause, always providing clear evidence of her own competence and the incompetence of the two young men. She has to be at the top of her game in this new wizarding world of intolerance, being a muggle-born. Ron's storyline is reminiscent of 'The Goblet of Fire' in that he wrestles with feelings of inadequacy when placed next to Harry, and in DH he goes over the edge (though partly due to the evil influence of the locket horcrux, a nice nod to the One Ring from 'The Lord of the Rings').

My favorite parts, and what I believe are also objectively the best parts, all pertain to camping. The trio are isolated in their trips across the wilds of Britain; it's being out in the middle of nowhere that we learn most about them as characters, and realize how much they've matured over the course of the series. In the past Harry has depended on the Dursleys, Dumbledore, the Weasleys, but now he's on his own, calling the shots and cutting out a shaky existence for himself and his friends. Harry Potter is a man now.

This film is darker than I imagined the story being while reading the book. While many of the events that transpire in both book and film are essentially the same, the film's execution makes the story all the more hopeless, cynical, and gritty. One scene that stands out is when Harry and Ron come up the stairs from the Malfoy's basement to find Hermione lying on the cold, hard floor with ""mudblood"" carved into her flesh, presumably from Bellatrix's dagger. For me, this was more moving than any death that happened in the films thus far; maybe it's because Avada Kedavra is a painless release from life, whereas the torture and degradation of Hermione leaves the viewer with the impression that Hermione will have to relive those moments in her mind for the remainder of her life.

In the following scene, when the trio escape the clutches of the Death Eaters, we are met with the sudden death of Dobby the house-elf. I see this as being the ultimate end to Harry's childhood (moreso than the death of Hedwig earlier in the film). With Dobby gone, there is nothing innocent and endearing left in Harry's life to anchor him to his earlier years at Hogwarts. Dobby was always an annoying character, but a lovable character. You couldn't help but feel warmth at his efforts to save Harry Potter time and time again, even when those attempts endangered Harry's physical well-being. When Harry buries Dobby, he's also burying the last remnants of that special magic from the first few films. There is nothing sweet left in the universe until Harry can manage to defeat Lord Voldemort, once and for all. As someone who has read the book, I warn you that there are many more deaths to come in Part II. Major characters start dropping like flies.

While darkness isn't a positive attribute in and of itself, it's a framework wherein a lot of meaningful things can happen. Usually through loss or death. And a lot of that happens in the Harry Potter series. The screenplay writer, Steve Kloves, delivers much of the potential that comes alongside mature storytelling; as J.K. Rowling did to some degree in the novel itself.

If I had to think of something to complain about, it'd be that the film moves too fast in places. It's already two and a half hours. I believe it would've been a good idea to stretch that out a little further to give these scenes more time to play out, so that the finished product didn't seem like such a flash before your eyes.",1309737600,,7095,4.610451306413301

With that said there are some omissions from the book, but you can't get everything about this book into a 2.5 hour movie.

It isn't horrible throughout, but there are parts where the screen is so dark that it is hard to see the picture.

Let me say I did not buy this from Amazon..I bought it from target when it was on sale. Never the less this ia a GREAT BUY!

a couple days after I bought it I went of to my cousin's house for the evening to watch the movie. we watched it on their ig screen TV(the older ""projection"" kind with the fat back) and the DVD's quality was pretty good on it. then just last night we played it on our own HD plasma TV(720p) tv and it looked even better!!!

as for the movie it's self,I think this is one of the best HPs!!!I really liked it cause the trio really got to show how good they can act and there was a lot of emotion and really good dialogue.

so,I would recommend this movie and combo pack to anyone who wants to own both the Blu-ray and DVD and get the Digital copy as an added bonus!

I would also like to note that the Blu-ray ""packaging"" is really good and solid..really feels nice in the hands and doesn't feellike it would easily break.",1308873600,3,1797,4.188405797101449
3816873,4,B001UV4XI8,"I wanted to buy this 2-disc set via my Amazon account. However, it was only offered for sale at Walmart. Unless you found one of these discussion forums, how would you know that a 2-disc set of Deathly Hallows, Part 1 was even available for sale? What if you don't have a Walmart store in your area? You can't readily get to any in our state by public transit.  Walmart's website sold out within days. No indication it will be re-stocked.

This has harmed consumers. The 2 disc DVD set is now being offered for 400% of the $20 retail price. It was unfair and likely an illegal trade practice for WB to restrict sales of the 2-disc DVD set to Walmart. Harry Potter isn't just any other movie franchise; it is a market mover. The extra content on the Blu-ray discs could have easily been made available on the DVD player version. Was this a cynical ploy by Warner Bros. to push consumers to the more profitable Blu-Ray platform? It isn't a trivial switch. Besides buying a Blu-ray player, you also have to buy a digital TV, cables, and upgrades.

The product description is confusing and mis-leading. Walmart posted the Combo description for the 2-disc set. No wonder so many people bought the Combo set only to find out afterwards that the extra content wasn't viewable on DVD players. Some retailers offered only the expensive Blu-ray Combo set, and not the DVD single.  That's not the way to treat customers.

WB rushed these discs to market. The 2-disc set was sloppily produced, but at least they work! Many Amazon posts complain about poor quality Blu-Ray and DVD discs: unviewable picture, bad color, no contrast, pixelation, screen freezes, and too much advertising content. This was outrageous.

Take a minute to complain where it can get some traction. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will act if enough of us complain about unfair trade practices, deceptive advertising, and shoddy quality. The long awaited final film in the series comes out this summer. Do we want to go through this again when Deathly Hallow Part 2 is released on DVD? I want a 2-disc DVD set to complete my collection. It should be readily available and at a fair price. Children can ask their parents to file the complaint either in a letter or online.

This movie in particular seems to put Harry and crew in more adult situations.  Rather than getting punched by Malfoy, the penalty for failure in this movie is death.  I really liked this movie.  The only problem I had was a very adult sequence where Ron imagines Harry and Hermione together.  They are not clothed when this happens.  You don't see any nudity, but we are a far cry away from when the actors seemed like they were in 5th grade.

When I first received this movie, I was able to watch the BlueRay a total of two times before it would stop after the intro.  The third watching attempt was a few days past 30 days and it would stick with no option to get to the movie.  The DVD version plays just fine.  After a little struggle, Amazon made a one time exception and replaced it.  Now, after receiving it and deciding to watch it again I am encountering the same thing.  This time I am SOL. I have a top of the line Sony BlueRay and have never had any other issue, so I know it is not my player.  Maybe they were given a bad batch from WB?

leaving them out. The film did not look as dark as some other reviewers have claimed. I watched it on a regular television with a standard DVD-VHS player. If you have not read the book you may find the film more than a little confusing, many
changes were made in the screenplay that were not needed to put the story across; the special effects are as good as ever and the soundtrack is just as good as all the others in the series. Will probably get a copy of the DVD to add to my Potter DVD collection to have the full set, but do not feel that this is the best of the
series of films. Cannot wait to see the eighth and last film. Though I suspect it will have many changes from the book too. One last comment I feel that the Dursleys and the actors that portray them got the short end of the stick in this film.

3816925,5,B001UV4XI8,"The book is waaaaay too big to make into a movie without leaving out some serious amounts of story, so they split it into two parts, which was a wise decision.

I've worked on some movies, and the ideal length of book to make into a movie is really a novelette. Anything longer, and you have to cut a lot out.

This movie is very true to the first half of the book, and I'm delighted that they managed to cram in as much as they did.

It's all at least as well done as the rest of the series, in other words, superlative, and I'm very happy with it.",1308355200,,549,3.9727272727272727
3816926,3,B001UV4XI8,"As others have said, `Deathly Hallows Part I' is a good film for fans of the 7th book.  David Yates is faithful to the novel (to a fault, perhaps), and those who enjoyed reading JK Rowling's final book in the Harry Potter series will be satisfied (especially since `Part II' is coming to theaters in just a few weeks).

As a stand-alone film, however, `Part I' suffers for the same reason Rowling's book suffers - too much exposition, too many over-complicated plot threads to set up, and too little action.  It's not that nothing happens - actually, Yates manages to include all of the action sequences from the first 500 pages of the novel (the escape from Privet Drive, the aftermath of the wedding, the visit to Godric's Hollow, the incident at Luna's house, the Gringotts break-in, etc.).  But it all feels somewhat like a series of disconnected scenes cobbled together with too much talking, whining, and camping in between.  Like the book, the film focuses almost exclusively on our trio of teenage heroes as they try to track down and destroy a series of Horcruxes (magical objects containing segmented parts of Voldemort's soul) while at the same time avoiding detection and capture by followers of the Dark Lord.  Unfortunately, an awful lot of exciting-sounding things are happening to the characters who are NOT Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but neither the book nor the film lets us experience any of them.  And these other characters are sorely missed.

There is so much sheer plot in this movie that it's difficult to keep up with it - there are so many things we need to understand to make sense of it all (the mythology of Horcruxes, the meaning of the titular Deathly Hallows, convoluted wand lore . . . and how they all play into the mission to bring down Voldemort and save the world for Wizards and Muggles alike).  And none of it goes anywhere in this film.  The final film will probably be more satisfying, since it actually has an ending . . . `Part I' does not.

Several characters die in `Part I' - only one of them generates the kind of pain I expected (and as we see in the novel).  If anything, Yates sacrificed the emotional heart of the story in trying to stay so close to the overriding plot, probably the result of breaking the novel into two parts.  The pay-off will come in `Part II,' so it may all come together fine in the end.  Actually, Yates has a chance to improve on the novel in this final film - Rowling left us hanging a bit with her final few chapters (no Harry/Snape resolution, no Harry/Ginny reunion, no sense of the aftermath of that final battle at Hogwarts).  The `Part II' trailers suggest that Yates may have understood this.  I hope so.

If you love the Potter universe, you've undoubtedly already seen this film.  If you're just curious, watch the other movies first.  And wait until July 14 to watch `Part I' - then you can rush right out and see `Part II' on July 15.  Perhaps together the films will do what `Part I' can't do alone.

One final note - I watched this on a standard DVD on a pretty ordinary and inexpensive TV, and I did not find the scenes excessively dark or difficult to see.  Since so many reviewers mentioned the poor quality of the ""transfer"" on the DVD, I'm not sure what this means.  I had no problems.",1308355200,5,3279,4.529711375212224
3816927,3,B001UV4XI8,"To begin with, settling down to watch this film, I began to think there had been a mistake.

I was wondering how much it woukld cost to return the thing from Australia before I finally found 'Chapter 7' which seemed to be the actual film.
Next time, manufacturer, just give me the film.

While I am an adult, I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and taking my niece and nephews to see them.  This one I missed in the theaters.  I am glad I waited for the DVD release.  It mainly showcases the 3 principle actors and is filmed very dark.  It kept my interest, but was just a prequel to the big finale in Part  II.  Frankly, they could have shortened this to an hour and put it with II and shown us the movie as one big send off.  I look forward to the seeing Part II, but may wait for the DVD again.",1308096000,,588,3.9237288135593222

3816931,2,B001UV4XI8,"I tried hard to watch this, but I kept falling asleep.  The movie is dark in its filming, but not in its characters.  So the filming puts you into a mood the characters and action does not really support.  And speaking of action, this moving is terribly lacking.  The previous potter movies were action packed with all sorts of jokes and interactions.  This movie has some action, then it goes on some long drawn out hiatus.  The characters blink onto some deserted island or forest, and its totally barren.  And they sit there and look at each other for like 5 minutes.  I just can't get into it.  Seems like this is how they stretched two movies out of this.  By putting in all this dead time.

Then the tension between the 3 main characters seems forced and strained.  Its unnatural, based on the previous films.  Even if there is some underlying magical reason for it, it does not come across right.  Even the story.  The way this begins with characters that are not really bad, being in league with bad characters is awkward.  The whole story is not a natural evolution from the previous ones, its totally out of left field.

I gave it 2 stars because it actually has a plot in there.  It had acceptable acting, and good sets.

I might have enjoyed it if I did not expect so much from it.  That expectation did not hurt my view on the previous entries in the series.  This one just fails.",1307923200,4,1393,4.405511811023622

Although I was dragged to see it with my girlfriend, once I had sat down with my popcorn and coke I felt myself riveted.

Many of the flaws in the earlier films have been corrected, particularly the wand fights. Previously, the wand fights were a little slow and nothing you hadn't seen before. In this film, the wand fights are unexpected and like something from a shoot out in a cops and robbers film.

The performances are excellent, and the quality of the film as a whole is very good. I am not giving this five stars just yet, not until I see the final film.

 now, we have to make the 7th movie into two parts, instead of finishing off the series with a great movie, we get an ok movie way too drawn out, and really, do we need to cover emma watson's top parts so much, while everyone else is dressed normal, she has to wear enough clothes to survive in the artic winters, yes, some teen girls have boobs, she's not the only one, of course no matter what harry potter fans will get this movie, like i did.

but without going into a long review they took the fun out of these movies, if you like harry potter get it, but it could have been much better and should have been, but everyone made more money, which is the only thing a studio cares about now, just like the rest of us, so what could have been is not, so we take what they give us, i got my copy new for 10 bucks, would not have paid anymore for it, as usual amazon delivers like a champ, but miss the charm of the older potter movies..

3816996,3,B001UV4XI8,"Since ""...Goblet of Fire"", the Harry Potter novels and movies have been on a slow steady slide from being charming original young adult fantasies to becoming pedestrian adult fantasies of the lowest order. This is the penultimate completion of that slide, with enough of the good stuff stripped out of the novel so as to render it almost faceless and meaningless. One of the themes of the last novel is that Harry has been ultimately betrayed and abandoned by all of the adults in his life - including Dumbledore, who was so busy acting so mysterious and wizardly that he did not tell Harry what he needed to know in order to survive. There is no trace of Harry Potter's inner conflict in this movie. All that leaves you with is a bunch of guys throwing power bolts out of magic wands. For that you can watch the X-Men.",1307145600,3,819,4.503355704697986

This way they can include everything from the last book and make it into a fitting end to one of the greatest franchises that we've seen in awhile. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 picks up where the Half Blood Prince leaves off and starts off with alot of action. The characters we've grown with through each and every single movie have grown up as well. We learn in this movie how much they think of each other and how much their lives intertwine with everything in the world of Harry Potter.

3817001,5,B001UV4XI8,"I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter film adaptations. That being said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I, takes the cake in all respects as compared to previous Potter movies. As you may be aware, this is split after Malfoy Manor, therefore, you will not get a resolution with this film. However, the movie does end at a fitting point, setting a clear stage for the culmination in the next film, to be released in July 2011. What sets this film apart, however, is that it completes the transformation begun in the film adaptation of the Half-Blood Prince. This film is very DARK and emotional. This was the intention, as the Harry Potter sequel matured along with its originally intended audience. I would recommend this film for all ages, as there are no particularly troublesome scenes, yet, on the whole, this is an adult film, filled with angst, struggle, and believable character interaction. Acting has consistently improved over the course of the films: this is no exception. Definitely recommended, and you will not be able to refrain from watching this movie over and over if you are a Harry Potter fan. Also, this is consistent with the books: with minimal add-ons occurring only to improve the overall quality of the film. The highlight, for me, however, was the segment portraying the ""Tale of the Three Brothers,"" done in an animated storybook style.

3817031,2,B001UV4XI8,"This is the movie that adapts the first half of the dullest and dreariest of the series of books by J.K. Rowling. (Not the longest book, nor the book with the most events, but I'm sure Warner Brothers is now kicking themselves and wishing they'd started splitting these back at Azkaban to make twice as much money.)

I haven't changed my opinion of the book -- which is, by far, the worst of the series, with a sag in the middle like a couch that Hagrid just sat on -- and the movie is as deeply faithful to the book in the way that this series of movies always has been...and that means, of course, that it's full of dull, dreary camping sequences, in which Harry, Ron, and Hermoine mope at each other for what feels like the full eight months the book covers.

(Somewhere in the middle of that, my younger son quietly stated that he wasn't having any fun and went up to his room to play. When your movie isn't more entertaining than playing alone with dominoes, you've got a serious problem.)

The plot makes as much sense here as it did in the book: which is to say, it's still the quintessentially English story about a boy who definitely isn't too smart for his station, but is indomitable enough to muddle through because his heart is true. Rowling has no interest in a resistance movement against her magical dictator, nor does she care about what's happening to the UK under Voldemort (much less the rest of the world, which nearly doesn't exist in the Harry Potter world), or even in depicting Harry Potter as any kind of leader or competent hero.

No, instead Deathly Hallows 1 is the story of three friends (who hate each other) hiding out in the woods instead of trying to find the seven magical [Plot Coupons] Horcruxes, which they need (along with three pounds fifty in coins) to send off to Rowling for an ending. And this movie doesn't even get them to the point where they actually start to accomplish their quest, so it's entirely ominous beginning and dreary middle. This is the movie you have to get through to get Deathly Hallows 2, and you'd have to be a stone Potter fan -- the kind unwilling to admit anything connected to Rowling is less than fabulous -- to strongly enjoy it as a movie in its own right.",1306713600,4,2229,4.442542787286063

""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is 2 1/2 hours of a dark lit, hard to see road picture. Very little of the enchantment, humor and wondrous effects are present. For the time spent, not much happens. It consists of Harry, Ron & Hermione walking from one point to the next, looking for and destroying one Horcrux while camping out in a tent. It could all have been condensed into a movie less than 1/2 the time. Of course then the makers of it would have made less money than they did by stretching one movie's worth of story into two movies.

3817049,4,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter and the Deatly Hallows part 1 is an much bigger improvement over The Half Blood Prince. I went to the theatre to see THBP and was seriously bored. There were some comical moments that got a few laughs from me and the audience at least. The problem was the whole thing was almost entirely focused on romance. Only the last few minutes do they show what Voldemort's crew are up to. And it was not much unfortunately. I heard the book had much more to them on the final scene of the movie.

The Deathly Hallows Part 1 gets us back on track, where the Harry Potter series has been going. The best thing the previous Potter showed were the Horcrux's. I won't spoil what that's about, but Harry is on a quest to destroy these artifacts. Voldemort is around more this time. He has sent out his Death Eaters to infiltrate the Ministestry of Magic. Many laws are changed, especially against the muggels, the non-magic users.

Bellatrix and a few other Death Eaters play a seprate roll from the infiltrators and that's to go capture Harry Potter. Hermoime and Ron stick very close to Harry, and not just out of friendship. Alastor, Hargrid, and many others try to use themselves to shield Harry from harm. Harry openly objects to everyone doing this. He cares a lot about his friends and mentors. The Death Eaters won't rest in this one. They actively are on the hunt for Harry.

There is a big break from the constant action later on, which was needed eventually. I thought that provided good pacing in that way. At this point in the movie Harry is in hiding along with Hermoime and Ron. They help Harry on his quest to destroy the Horcrux's at the same time. The stress of the situation really does show with the three. Ron is scared and barely talks, he is on edge. He keeps listening to the radio of the take over from Voldemort. Harry gets very defensive to everyone. Hermoime is despressed, but deals with things not too badly in this nightmare scenario.

This feels like half a story, well...because it is. That's why I couldn't give this one 5 stars. This is much more improved from the previous movie. The Deathly Hallows part 1 makes a nice setup for the second one coming this year. It'll be the last of the Harry Potter's, so this one is a definite watch to complete the whole story.",1306627200,,2298,4.477326968973747

In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" the penultimate entry in the decade-long ""Harry Potter"" movie series (it covers only one-half of the final novel with the second half due out at a later time), things are going from bad to worse for our intrepid little band of wand-waving heroes and the people who have taught and raised them.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.

For those who are diehard devotees of the ""Potter"" series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching ""Deathly Hallows"" must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails).  For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow.  The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment.

Like any series the movies are always catching up with the book so there is always the unknown expectation that the movie will miss the mark as far as the story goes. Deathly Hallows however follows reasonably close to the book which I think is made easier because the producers could stretch it out over two movies, thus capture more closely to the story line then the other HP movies.
I still think however that given the intensity of the final book that part 1 missed some opportunities to nail it by digressing a little from the book and that was a bit disappointing.
The telling will be in part 2 when all the action really starts and if the producers don't capture it well then it will ruin the whole lot. Of all the movies in the series I rate this my favourite at this point.",1306195200,,887,4.317365269461078

3817161,2,B001UV4XI8,"I have the HP series in books (preferred) and in dvds. I loved this movie in the theater and saw it a couple of times (having learned to not compare the movies to the depth of the books). It was probably my favorite to date if I thought of ranking the movies. The dvd is a disgrace as WB seems to have eliminated scenes and definitely transfered data so poorly that the viewing is riddled with visual pauses, jumps and distortions. All prior dvds had two discs with nice extras. The prior dvd versions were true to the theater versions and were decent quality for viewing. WB execs who authorized putting out a shortened, cheaply and badly transferred video single disc dvd should be shamed and reprimanded/fired. This reflects poorly on WB's greed overcoming their pride in quality and it is insulting to JKRowling who entrusted her series to them.

Do they expect all of the HP fans, who've already spent good money on the entire collection of HP dvds to date to now, at the final year's movies, run out and buy a Blue-Ray player and re-buy the prior years in Blue-Ray version??? Of course, I'm reading reviews that, while the blue-ray version does include more of the theater movie without glitchy distortions, they also received no new extras.

As another reviewer stated, WB is obviously saving up extras now to get us to buy the ultimate editions. I recommend most everything that is authorized HP, but feel WB owes JKR and the fans an apology...and a replacement dvd worth the price. I find myself wondering if the ultimate edition dvd's will also be short-changed?? I'll wait for reviews before considering buying.",1306108800,,1622,4.72791519434629

So although, I'm glad they split the last book into two movies (part 2 should be AWESOME!), it made for a somewhat boring part 1.

Here's how you watch this movie:  pop it into the player, press play, go out for dinner.  Then, when you're back home, turn on the TV and watch the movie.

I see why some people download pirated movies -- it lets you skip the commercials.

For instance, when Ron leaves the group, barely anything happens. Of course, that's not the case. Harry gets to see his parents graves, which should it have been a strong scene, but it didn't felt like that.  Also, it didn't felt like these guys knew what they were doing and when they went to the Ministry of Magic. This is extra, but didn't Harry saved hundreds of wizards that day? Well I guess they missed that too. I had a lot of expectations and maybe that's why I'm a bit disappointed. But I'm pretty sure most people will like it.

This film captures those shifts beautifully. Harry, Ron and Hermione are grown, and feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. This is a somber film, so different from the first few, but very powerful. The director used the landscape beautifully in this film to convey the stark, dark feeling of this phase of their quest, and the impact of wearing the 2nd Horcrux. From dreary woods to desolate cliffs and beachsides, the settings are gorgeous, empty, and spooky. The three leads put in their best and subtlest performances to date - no more mugging for the camera. They convey both their deep affections and inner turmoils brilliantly. Dream sequences are gorgeous, and the animated telling of the story of the 3 brothers (the genesis of the deathly hallows of the title) is brilliant. I also loved the scene where Hermione and Harry briefly take off the Horcrux and dance - just a moment of joy before they reshoulder their burden.

My only warning would be that this film will make no sense to someone not familiar with the books or other movies. While some of the past movies have been OK as standalones, this one requires prior knowledge of the story, and very little is offered as explanation for those that don't already know. I'm fine with that - this is the 7th film after all.

The first half of the book was hard!  It went on and on with little action or excitement.  But then, as I continued to read, I understood that Ms Rowling needed to get us inside Harry's head to set up the final sequence of events and to show that this was no easy Journey that Harry, Ron and Hermoine were on.  That they sacrificed greatly to reach their goal.  The movie, thankfully, was very true to the book.  It was not the easiest movie to sit through as it is a little depressing.  The viewer is taken along with Harry and the gang and it shows how hard it is on them - how easy it would have been to give up.  Of course they do not give up and the next movie will be worth the wait as part one has set the stage exactly as it should be.

3817363,4,B001UV4XI8,"The producers of the Harry Potter film franchise seem to have given up on using a different director with his or her unique style for every episode. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" is the third Harry Potter film directed by David Yates, whose previous work was mostly in British television. Yates seems to have been charged with directing the young wizard's darker years. J.K. Rowling's tome of Year 7 would have benefited from much tighter editing, but, unlike the previous two volumes, the filmmakers did not decide to correct this flaw for the silver screen. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is being presented as two installments on film. This is its only serious flaw. It could, or should, have skipped some of the wizard trio's camping adventures to create one, more focused three-hour film.

The film begins on a dark note, literally. The Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) announces, ""These are dark times,"" and the headlines of The Daily Prophet scream, ""Dark Mark Sparks Panic."" Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) erases herself from her parents' memories, and The Order of the Phoenix prepares to escort Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) to a safe house under deep cover. But Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) betrays their plans to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Even the rare festivities of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding are interrupted by the death of the Minster of Magic and an attack of Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) are forced to flee. The only way to save the world from Voldemort's wrath is to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes that preserve his soul.

There is an oddity in the tone of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". It gives the impression that all of the necessary information won't fit in the film, yet there is a lot of storyline that could have been cut out to make the film stronger. Too much included, while at the same time not enough is explained. True to the book, however, the film does not shy away from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death. And a lot of dark imagery. This might be too frightening for Harry Potter's youngest fans. The level of mayhem probably qualifies it as an action movie. The film is generally entertaining, if meandering in parts. I found the animation that illustrates the pivotal ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", as found in ""The Tales of Beedle the Bard"", particularly effective.",1305072000,,2486,4.902612826603326

3817379,4,B001UV4XI8,"I may be giving this movie 4 stars, but this will not be a glowing review. HARRY POTTER has one story. Throughout the entire series, there has been one central theme: Boy learns magic and comes closer to his destiny to face off against evil. Did it take 8 movies to get there? Not to say that I didn't enjoy all of the movies, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, really hammers this point home for me as it ends dramatically and quite ceremoniously as if to say.... ""Come back again folks. Thanks for your cash."" This was just one more TEASER film building up to the payoff.

I enjoy the HARRY POTTER movies. Don't get me wrong. Yet, it's like a bunch of movies centered around subplots building up to what is finally coming next in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. Resolution. Finale. I don't know if I want to say, ""Thank God."" or wish there were more movies coming. I think it's ""Thank God.""

HARRY POTTER is the STAR WARS of this era, and I think they had more tact and circumstance then the STAR WARS series had, but both series made entire movies out of less than important story lines.

DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is an okay movie in a series of good movies that are meandering and sometimes pointless but ultimately entertaining and good. PART 1 spends too much time being dramatic and world ending and hammering on the point that we should be afraid, very afraid. In doing so, it ultimately bores children who have been following the series to death and bores people like me who want the payoff to hurry up and get here for godsakes.

DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 better not disappoint because we've sat through 7 movies of subplot to get here... sheeesshh.",1305072000,,1681,4.465798045602606
3817380,1,B001UV4XI8,"I hardly remember the book and this movie did little to refresh my memory. I do recall how Rowling wasted 200 pages with Hermione & Harry apparating around the country doing NOTHING, and the overall impression of being underwhelmed by the story (or lack thereof).

I thought they would cut short all the Harry & Hermione ""on the run"" sequence from the book since it doesn't do anything to advance the story. But I was so wrong.  There is  what seems like 12 hours of nothing but H&H camping, again doing nothing to advance the story.

There is so little action, so little dialog and so many slow-moving scenes that I couldn't watch the whole thing.  I started fast forwarding after about an hour that felt like half a day and only watched scenes where people actually talked to each other (rather than just staring at each other) or some action, no matter how meager, was taking place.

I did enjoy the ""Three Brothers"" sequence. The animation was very interesting and unusual.  As for the rest of the film I recommend that if you must see it, you rent it or see at a theater, but don't waste your money on buying it.",1305072000,10,1117,4.472906403940887

Unfortunately, as a movie, this entry in the Harry Potter series really doesn't stand up on it's own. It's basically just filling the gap between the previous film and the upcoming final conflict. I suppose given the amount of story that is covered in the novel, this is a necessary evil.

What I really want to review is the DVD picture quality. Oh my...it is bad. This is bar none the worst DVD quality I've seen since the original days of DVD. Compression artifacts are everywhere. Most noticeable is the area around Harry's glasses. There's nothing like mucking up the main character's face. As other reviewers have stated, the DVD isn't even at full capacity.

3817384,3,B001UV4XI8,"Having watched all of the previous Harry Potter movies and read all of the books I am not impressed with this movie.  The fist five movies were very good, but the Half Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows felt very different.  The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 consisted of random scenes splashed together with seemingly no flow to it.  Coupled with Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) mediocre performance, this film is a mess.  With regards to the story, this is a very depressing time for Harry and his friends, but Radcliffe displayed almost no emotion during the entire film.  It's understandable that Harry and his friends would be a bit moody, but there was no passion in Harry's voice, especially for what he and his friends had sacrificed to find the horcruxes (Hermoine was on par and Ron was good as always though).  For example, when Harry was asked if it felt better to take one of the horcruxes from around his neck he quickly said to Hermione ""Loads.""  I didn't sense that his character felt any better for having it away from him because of how he delivered the line.  There was no weight to that scene, and that was not the only one.  Most of the time, Harry just sat there in uncomfortable silence when he was asked a question or spoken to.  I felt myself hoping the characters got through the scenes without messing up their lines.

There was an awkward dancing scene along with awkward kissing scenes that added nothing to the film.  For example, Ginny shows up out of no where, Harry and her make out and then that's it...nothing else is spoken about their relationship or anything from the book.  Don't even get me started about the scene with the obviously computer generated half naked Hermoine and Harry walking toward Ron while he is trying to destroy the horcrux....weird!  Strange kissing scene ensues  My last upsetting issue was regarding the dark mood and some of the disturbing scenes (beware parents, I'm sure this movie will give the little ones nightmares - I will not let mine watch this one).  The dark mood is awkwardly peeled away at certain points to let in misplaced humor (noteably by Fred and George).  The Harry Potter series has lost it's fun feel and gone dark big time.  Not really a fan of that change, but I know the story has changed and things are not as they were.  Personally I blame Rowling locking herself up away from her family to write the final Harry Potter books (may or may not be true).  I heard that somewhere and I think that her isolation from her family didn't make for the best material for this book.

This is not a bash Radcliffe session as there were others to blame.  Ultimately I blame the director as he could have made the scenes better, especially with transitioning them better.  While I am on the subject and bashing away, let me throw this in.  I say fire the current Harry and replace him with Frodo from Lord of the Rings for the final part 2.  It's easy to explain, Harry did a face changing spell that backfired and is now permanent.  Also, fire the director and get someone talented in there, not one of these dime a dozen ones.  That's my take and I hope you enjoyed it.",1304985600,4,3141,4.54270462633452
3817385,4,B001UV4XI8,"this was by far the darkest chapter in the harry potter series yet.it reminded me of ""empire strikes back"" or ""revenge of the sith"" in that it was a family film that took a very dark turn.
  the kids have to carry around a trinket for a while that makes them turn on eachother.it reminded me of ""lord of the rings"" and the hobbitts with the ring.
  it was not my favorite part.my favorite part was ""prisoner of azkaban"".although,i would rank it in the top half along with ""the half blood prince""

  i say it is a good movie.the only harry potter movie to be my favorite for an entire year.yes the movie industry is going to crap but this was still the winner.
  now id like to address all the ill informed misfits out there about something.i hear a lot of people saying that harry potter is evil.they say just because the kids are at a school learning magic,that they must be satanic.well,magic is magic and satanism is satanism .they are 2 entirely different things.some of the wiccans and celts and such belive there isn't even a devil at all.others still belive that he is real but they belive he is pure evil and they sure as crap don't worship him.any idiot in the multiverse knows that.so i say to these uninformed misfits....GET A LIFE AND THEN AN EDUCATION.......ITS this same of short cuts to thinking that caused the inquisition.

The film was a wonderful surprise as I didn't get to see it in the theater. The director/screen writer did not add anything to the story to boost his ego and managed to insert important details left out of previous films to make the story hang together.  Was the best film version of the books since the first 2 movies.

You feel frustrated and confused the entire time.  You want to ask someone, ""Who are these people, what are they doing, and why are they doing it?  What did I miss?""

That's how I felt with this movie.  Since I was watching the DVD, obviously I didn't come in 5 minutes late, but it felt like it.  I felt I had missed part of the plot, and never quite caught up with the story line.  I believe the cut scene at the start, when Harry is talking with his aunt, would have helped, but it still might have felt this way.

None of the others did this.  I always felt I came in at the beginning, and was able to follow the plot.

This movie has to be watched if one is going to have any clue at all when Part II comes out, but I was (for the first time in the series) very disappointed.

Now this time I used my Amazon Prime account and downloaded this film.  If I had to pay I would have been very disappointed in the quality and resolution of the display.  It took me less than an hour to download via UNBox and I could have endure a full hour or a bit more without impacting my connection (Comcast internet only, I use over the air Antennae for TV and what I can find online).  The beginning of the film was severely pixelated and then became blotchy about a quarter of the way through.  I believe my eyes got used to it and it was less of an issue or there was some streaming going on and my buffer caught up, not sure exactly how UNBox works.

I do not recommend downloading HD films.  Netflix and Hulu stream much better pictures currently there's no reason Amazon couldn't stand a little bump in the file size to get a better experience out of this method.  It's just under ~3 Gb so for broadband a couple more gigs ain't gonna kill anyone.",1304380800,3,1014,4.272251308900524

Now, I didn't remember that Mad Eye Moody was killed at the beginning of the 7th book. Like I said I am going to have to go and re-read the 7th book again because there is so much I don't remember. I do vaguely remember one of the Wesley twins dying. Like I said back to the book. Re-read and re-read again and again.",1304380800,,630,4.048
3817554,5,B001UV4XI8,"The acting was outstanding. I've always felt Rupert Grint as Ron was the most natural of the trio but up until now he hasn't had much to work with, usually stuck as comic relief. Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.

The soundtrack was really good. I particularly loved Obliviated in the beginning because it caught my attention right away and Farewell to Dobby because it was so beautiful and moving. The cinematography was also excellent. I wasn't fond of the camping scenes in the book but I didn't mind them in the movie because of the gorgeous location shots! Nearly all of the individual scenes were well-done, with a perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. My favorites were Hermione erasing her parents' memories and the silver doe. I was confused about the Harry/Hermione dance scene because I felt it was a bit out of character for Harry, but it was actually pretty cute.

The film wasn't perfect. My two biggest complaints were the lack of explanation for the mirror shard and no use of the invisibility cloak. Since the cloak is one of the Hallows, wouldn't it have made sense to remind the non-hardcore audience about it? Similarly, those who haven't read the books will be scratching their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard. I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity. Hers and Harry's romance was poorly treated in HBP as well and I was disappointed that it was more of the same this time.

My other complaints are really minor quibbles in comparison. I missed seeing Dudley and Harry's handshake, even though the movie works perfectly fine without it. I would have liked to see Harry and Ron hug after the destruction of the locket and have Harry assure Ron that he only sees Hermione as a sister (especially since some viewers thought he was trying to come on to Hermione in the dance scene!). I also felt Malfoy Manor, while a nice scene in itself, paled in comparison to the book. It was slightly rushed and watered down- namely Ron's reaction and Wormtail's fate. I suppose this was done for a reason, and it does work in the movie- but the book scene was so much better.

The end only made me want Part II right now! I guess I'll have to reread the book to satisfy myself until July.",1304294400,2,3030,4.584870848708487

However, what is in fact unfortunate is that 'Warner Brothers' waited until the last movie to actually go by the book, hence the two parts.

- Basically:

* If you are a true fan of the books: You will LOVE and greatly ENJOY the film, as it is plainly put ""The book coming to life before your eyes"".

* If you aren't a follower: You will still ENJOY the movie. It has some amazing cinematography! Yet, at times, it may seem a bit complex to a handful of viewers, this is because not everything is explained in detail as it is in the book, nevertheless this does not at all inhibit the audience from enjoying the magnificence of the film.

The quality is so bad I was actually wondering if I might have somehow received a bootleg DVD -- until I remembered that I had ordered straight from Amazon.  Even the legalistic warnings at the beginning and end are fuzzy and grainy.

I too have to conclude this was intentional, and feel cheated and disrespected by the studio.  I suppose I am playing right into their hands in writing this, for my review will probably cause some people to now skip the DVD and buy the more expensive Blu-ray.

Being a ""part 1"" there is a lot more exposition than the last 4 films: These characters have grown up and changed, the audience needs to catch up with the Harry,Ronald, Hermoine trio before that final conflict.  The screenwriter, as always, did a marvelous job of capturing the feel of the book and compressing it into length of this film.

However, I am SO, SO sick of the studios PURPOSEFULLY doing a bad job on their DVD transfers only to promote Blu-Rays.  The explosion of combo packs has driven this further, because many folks with a 32"" or smaller 720p set can't see the difference between a Blu-Ray and upcoverted DVD...UNLESS the DVD is a *terrible* quality source.  The studios are now MALICIOUSLY doing horrible transfer jobs in order to make the Blu-Ray look better.  This is not conspiracy theory.  Watch for yourself by comparing HP7 with HP4 or 5 on DVD!

There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON that the HP7 DVD should look this bad.  First off, it is only using a fraction of the available DVD dual-layer space available, and as such is *riddled* with compression artifacts.  You need no more proof than that, but the real proof is in the pudding!  Compare the HP4 and HP5 dark scenes with those in HP7 pt 1 and you will see NIGHT AND DAY difference in quality.  Things should be better today, not worse.  You can't tell me it was on accident.  This was almost certainly found and raised during quality control, and quietly snuffed by the marketing folks.  It was engineered this way on purpose.

While we are a Blu-Ray household with 4 total BD players (living room, MBR, newest desktop, newest laptop), we have nearly a dozen DVD Players counting older laptops, desktops, portable DVD players, and cars.  Overall, this movie undoubtedly will be watched more on DVD than on BD.  We shouldn't be subjecdted to inferior quality just because some bozo in Marketing things it will impact BD sales 1% to 2%.  I don't care if he's right.  It's not fair.  We pay a good price for the DVD, and we should get a product that is the best possible for the money.  Not one that is artifcially neutered for marketing reasons!!!

I blame Warner Brothers.  There is no excuse for this.  I do not feel this was an accident, and this needs to stop!

3817623,2,B001UV4XI8,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I"" is being released on Blu-ray in plenty of time to capitalize on the final installment of the saga, due in theatres this July.  Warner Brothers decided to divide the last book of the series into two motion pictures to incorporate as much plot and as many characters from the novel as possible.

Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is the primary obstacle to the total control by Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) of both the wizard and human worlds.  Voldemort has sent an army of Death Eaters to find the young wizard.  Accompanied by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), Harry embarks on a journey that finds him crossing paths with many of the characters he's previously encountered at Hogwarts.

Director David Yates handles the action sequences effectively. The film starts with a terrific chase in which Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns many of Harry's closest friends into Potter clones to confuse the Death Eaters.  Another standout sequence is Harry and friends' infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.  Unfortunately, the film's pacing is sluggish and bogs down the proceedings considerably.

This installment is far different in tone from the first.  It is darker and downbeat, plodding and repetitious.  The special effects, as usual in a Potter film, are very good, but the magic isn't there.  Back are familiar characters Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).

The three-disc Combo Pack edition contains Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy versions of the movie.  The main extra is the opening scene of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II.""  There are also additional scenes and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.  The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.",1303948800,,1869,5.309523809523809

This makes the Digital Copy even more worthless.
The special features disc is Blu-ray, however is a major disappointment. It is not labled at all. I tried it in different players before I discovered it was Blu-ray.

There are numerous scenes where it looks like the cgi isn't composited properly.  The colors don't resolve very well on the screen and it looks like the copy is muddy or murky.  I'm told it plays like this in the theater as well so it's not the dvd copy, which I thought at first, but for some reason they skimped on the cgi.  Which seems odd.  It plays like a cheap b-movie on late night television.  What a shame.  Hopefully they've fixed this in part 2.",1303862400,12,601,4.165217391304348

This seems to go to a rather dark place which unto itself can make for great drama but I prefer to see the characters rise above the challenges. Wonderful acting, beautiful scenery (if mostly stark) but our intrepid heroes appear less and less intrepid - perhaps the point of their dire circumstances and maybe more realistic but not more preferable personally. A two part final episode might be a throw back to the cliff-hangers of earlier cinema but it doesn't seem to have the same sense of holding-one's-breath tension. The good guys are quite beaten down, the bad guy has all the advantage and you don't get the feeling the heroes are even ready to step up and face him. Obviously this is all personal preference, I like the little guys to at least keep getting their shots in and to be able to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel (even if it turns out to be a train rushing at them). The Blu-ray set itself is top notch, wonderful quality print with plenty of extras, including what might be considered a lot of marketing for the last film.

The reasons why I think it was worth my time watching, is because I am so familiar with the story & background of Harry Potter & the characters in the story, that I could easily deal with the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of action in this movie. This Harry Potter film really showed me that Lord Voldemort is totally evil & the fact that Harry, Hermoine & Ron are overall on there own on what they have to do. Since the death of Dumbledore things have been really different for Harry, Hermoine & Ron. I don't think that just because it is a Harry Potter film doesn't necessarily mean the film has to be filled with tons of action. This film had a bunch of dialogue and plot in my opinion. There didn't have to be a ton of action in this movie for there to be a good story. Which this film did tell a good story.

I was thrilled when I read about the extras, especially the Maximum Movie Mode which has pop-ups that tell you information about the making of the film and the story behind the story.
THIS is where things go wrong, at least on my copy. The Maximum Movie Mode is filled with glitches. Some clips have NO AUDIO, others freeze while still others pop-up 5 seconds before a break in the story, which would make a logical place for an explanation to be offered. I'm not sure if this is an issue with just my copy or a loss of product quality because the Blu-Ray/DVD was rushed out for money making purposes.

Despite that, I haven't enjoyed HP since the first three, numbers 4,5, and 6 didn't do much for me, and number 6 I just didn't like.

In the Deathly Hallows, the acting was better and the cinematography and graphics really set the mood. There was a certain amount of fun to knowing what was going on because I read the books at least a dozen times while those around me hadn't a clue.

Still, I wonder if the director figured there was no need for much clarification because most of us would've gotten the points of the movie through friends, or because they were betting many of us have read these books.

Either way, the omission of details to be explained made this movie better than some of the last HP movies. Somehow, in their omissions, they kept the movie simple and more sensible, and made this a much better film than the others. To this style, I say why not make more book-to-movie adaptations like this? If anything, it would inspire me, and others, to read.",1303516800,,1049,4.419689119170984

It is $19.--something and it has all the special features the combo pack has except the opening scene for DH part II which I don't find that big of a deal because the movie is coming out soon and the fact that you can get it in the combo pack means that there is a pretty good chance that it can be found on youtube or on the Harry Potter Facebook page.  So to all you people peeved by the DVD I say again go to Wal-mart. I did so last night and watched all the special features and the movie (the quality of the movie is even better--I don't know what WB is playing at).  I feel much better.
Also I don't know if this will make you feel any better but I found out that for people with blu-ray they had to get the combo pack in order to see the special features.

I really don't understand what has happened with the movie versions of the Potter series.  They have gotten progressively darker.  Literally.  The notice really began after the ""Goblet of Fire.""  They may as well have shot the movie in a cave for I felt like that is what I was watching.  I have read every book and anybody watching this movie who has not, would be totally lost.  Half the time I was trying to figure out exactly what was going on.

All in all, a huge disappointment.  I keep buying the DVDs just so I have the entire series but this is one I doubt I would want to watch again.  Remember when Harry Potter was a ""kid's movie"" and was mystical and fun?  What happened?  I know they grew up and times became dark and troubled but I think it was taken a bit too far.  Perhaps Ron should have kept his Deluminator lit throughout the movie to ""shed some light"" on the action.

Best movies of the bunch, in my opinion, are the first three.  ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", ""The Chamber of Secrets"" and ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""

After watching Part 1 of ""The Deathly Hallows"" I know what to expect in Part 2.  DARKNESS.",1303430400,6,1225,4.373333333333333
3817698,1,B001UV4XI8,"Most males will stand up from watching the movie as if they're getting out of a bathtub of estrogen. Of course, women will obviously rate it highly for the same reason. Given Rowlings past public comments this let-down was likely inevitable.

Examples? In a 2002 American news interview Rowling snobbishly responded to a question on her reported high anxiety over the handling of the first film by director Chris Columbus; ""Yes, I was very anxious - I mean, after all, he IS an American."" (By the way, no American actors were even considered for the series even though most are just as Socialist as some of her other comments prove.)

More recently, she responded on the internet to the enormous outrage over her making an asexual character into a homosexual (Dumbledore) by writing, ""How dare you criticize what I write."" How dare us?? You broke the trust of parents by injecting your political agenda and this wasn't the only instance, lady. - How dare YOU!?

3817699,4,B001UV4XI8,"Amazon tends to lump the reviews for all the different versions of the product together. This review is for the DVD version.

The movie is fine and the audio is great, but the video transfer is absolutely the worst I have ever seen. Or, not seen, if you catch my drift: even with the lights out at night in a perfectly dark room, the first 1/3 of the movie is completely unwatchable. It's not just that the movie is dark, it's that the movie is lacking any sort of brightness at all.

On my TV, the movie looks like it was shot in dense, black fog. I was keenly disappointed, since the deleted scenes looked fine.

I have a Panasonic plasma TV and a Sony DVD player. Neither piece of equipment could be considered cheap or low-end. The difference between the picture and anything else I have ever put into the DVD player is like, er, night and day.

I played around with the menus on the DVD player, and could not find any unusual settings. And although I performed some experiments (turning progressive mode off, fiddling with the black level, and the cinema modes), nothing I did made any real improvement to the picture.

Since not everyone who bought this item is complaining about the poor video quality (although quite a few people are), I'm not sure if this is a quality control issue, or if the studio made some technical decisions about how to compress the video that only show up on certain players and TVs. You would think that Warner's would know what it is doing. Presumably, so does Sony, who invented the DVD format (along with Phillips).

I put the disk into the DVD drive on my desktop computer, and the picture looked fine. The movie was dark, but you could see what was going on. I suppose I can watch the rest of the movie that way. My computer monitor is significantly smaller than my TV, but at least I can enjoy the movie.

Perhaps the title of the review should have been, ""Are You Feeling Lucky?"" Because it's going to take a bit of luck on your part to get a DVD that's actually watchable. Judging from the other reviews, about 10 to 15% of us are having problems watching this DVD.

p.s., the real ""extras"" on this disk are the interminable parade of ads for other HP products you are forced to wade through before you can arrive at the main menu.

UPDATE: The fact that the disk played tolerably well on my computer led me to suspect that (gasp!) my TV might need adjusting. I had several DVDs in my video library that included the TXH optimizer, which is probably the simplest way to check your TV setup. Sure enough, the Picture/Contrast setting was too low, and the Brightness was so poor, I couldn't even begin to make the necessary adjustment!

Some scouring on the internet got me the secret formula for entering Service Mode on my Panasonic TV. I found the menu for brightness, and boosted things until I could actually see the TXH drop shadow. Once I exited the service menu, I had to tweak the Black setting on the TV, and then I was able to finish the THX optimizer adjustments, including color and tint (you'll be needing special blue glasses for this last step, order them from the TXH consumer web page).

Bottom line: it was my TV, not the disk.

However, it would have been a lot easier all around if Warner's had included a test screen on the DVD. They wouldn't have had to include the TXH optimizer (I'm sure there's some sort of licencing fee invoved), but they could have had a test pattern that said something to the effect of, ""if you don't see all ten levels of black on the next screen, you need to adjust your set!""

Interestingly enough, this was the ONLY DVD I've found to be too dark. But everything is better now, and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.

p.s., THX has a list of DVDs that include the THX optimizer. Search the internet and you will find them. One of my favorites is ""Tombstone."" Another is ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"". The entire Indiana Jones series includes them, as do quite a few titles from Anchor Bay. Chances are, you already have one or more of them in your DVD collection.

I saw some very minor ones in only one scene.

Player: I like that this Blu Ray does not use Java. So, when I turn off/on my player, the movie picks back up wherever I left off without having to do a bookmark and go through the FBI warnings and crap (like you do for Half-Blood Prince).

One seen from the book that I think they should had added more was when Ron returned and Ron and Hermione get into a little spat.  That scene was much better in the book.  You can see how unsure Harry is but he keeps trying.  Even when he learns some hurtful things he just keeps going.  His determination is unmatch by Tom Riddle.  I refuse to call him by the name he came up with.  It is not one he earned.  In this movie you see a side of Tom, the scared side.  He thought he was the best but now he knows he is not.

I did not see the movie in the theater, rather I waited for the DVD so I could watch it closer to the release of part 2.  If a person watched it without reading the book, they'd have no idea what half the plotlines were about.  The whole ""searching for the wand Voldy flashbacks"", and the addition of more than one wand maker, was very confusing for the members of my family who hadn't read the books but had seen all the previous movies. Personally this movie needed either more dialog or a narrator IMO. It was ok, but I prefer the earlier movies when more of the book was included. To me, the later books (5,6,7) aren't really ""movie material"" without a narrator.  Look at LOR, they did a great job on those movies by having a narrator introduce the complicated plot lines at the beginning, so a viewer had a guide as they watched (and a clue). For readers of the books, this movie was OK. For people who just wanted to continue the series on screen and haven't read the books, not so good.",1303257600,4,1056,4.296482412060302

3817764,5,B001UV4XI8,"According to the Blu-ray disc Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will be released in theaters on July 15th and if that isn't enough it will be released in 3-D as well. That should make for a really grand finish to the series. Part 1 is a generally exciting film that holds one's attention very well. Although the section where the three are on the run may seem to slow down the pace, the movie tracks the book pretty well and these scenes provide an opportunity to reveal the emotions with which each of them must deal.

I've noticed some negative comments on sound and picture and have just replayed the opening part with the sole intention of evaluating the sound and picture; the results are conclusive, they are both outstanding. The surround speakers are given a terrific workout and the subwoofer is nicely exercised as well. I would give both sound and picture top marks for excellence. The picture is crisp and clear and never too dark so as to mask the action.

I would agree that if one had not read the book it could be more difficult to follow the story's turns and twists. If one has not read the book this would be a great time to do just that. I believe it was better to divide the book into two parts so the story could be more systematically covered. I hope the release of the Blu-ray 3D version will not be delayed too long after the movie is released in theaters.

In summary, this is an outstanding movie version of the first part of the book and provides a solid platform for the completion of the story. I'm delighted to have this movie as a part of my collection.",1303171200,,1595,4.381756756756757

If your only getting one bar then of course its not going to be as clear as if you are at full bars. Some of the problems people are having really sounds likes video settings of video card settings being off or it might be time to get better hardware. I use the Amazon on demand to watch movies on my desktop, laptop, and my HDTV via Roku box, all not more then two years. Video quality is great and everyone i have introduced to the service love it and continue to use it more and more.. If you are having problems with video streaming and don't know how to fix it yourself, Amazon people on staff to help you and answer questions. It would be smart to contact them insted of making ignorant post in a place meant for reviews of the movie itself.

Ok now that is over with i would just like to say that the movie was Great!! If you have watched and liked the other harry potter movies then you will like this movie.",1303171200,,1064,4.110576923076923

Not everyone shops at Wally World or cares to do so.  I resent being forced to shop where I don't agree with their corporate policy.  Had 1-6 been sold this way, I could understand it but they have simply downgraded their product without warning the buying public.

3817768,5,B001UV4XI8,"The Harry Potter series of books are the best I have ever read.  At times I am disappointed when some of the film adaptations delete sections, compress, or alter the books; although most are good movies in their own right.  Deathly Hallows part I does a good job translating the first 2/3 of the book and I would say the movie is about 75% accurate and captures the essence of the book.  There are parts that are very well brought to life, particularly the part where Harry sees the Patronus that leads him to the sword of Gryffindor, the return of Ron, and the destruction of the locket Horcrux.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rubert Grint, and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) have really grown into their roles - when I see them, I see their book counterparts.  The movies do tend to downplay Harry's temper and diminish his frequent use of the invisibility cloak in the books (one of the Deathly Hallows), but it has been fun watching the actors grow up and the filmmaking team as a whole has made a very deliberate effort to stay true to J.K. Rowling's vision.  Deathly Hallows part I has really nice cinematography and sets the stage well for the finale.  Highly recommended - but always read the book first to get the full story, and enjoy the movie to see most things come to life.",1303171200,3,1283,4.504310344827586
3817769,4,B001UV4XI8,"Technically it's half of a movie but I really feel that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stands on its own as an excellent HP film. While I really like it I probably wouldn't consider it to be the best HP movie but I quite enjoy it, some of the character's emotions come out really well here. For those who have not read J.K. Rowling's seventh and final book in the series the action may seem slow and it may seem a bit boring but this Part 1 was necessary. Not everyone will see the beauty of this 7th Potter film but I think splitting the final film in two was a great decision, of course money-wise it was a very good idea for Warner Bros profitable to do so. It also allows viewers a more complete visual experience of the book. Contrary to what some may think I feel that splitting the final book into two movies was for the best because it gives more room for character emotion, ambiance and best of all, it doesn't rush things. I must say the action is a bit slower and Hogwarts is missed but Part 1 sets things up nicely for the conclusion of the Harry potter saga on movies. Everything that needed to be in this movie was and they didn't cut out much. As for the acting I don't think the actors have ever been better in a Harry Potter movie their performances here were nothing short of excellent and brilliant. I won't go through the storyline or the events of the movie, this should be clear by now and I don't think there is much more to say, basically Harry, Hermione and Ron search for the missing horcruxes. I don't want to spoil anything or reveal too much but I just want to say that one of my favorite parts was the animation showed for the story of the three brother in ""The Tales of Beetle the Bard"". It looked fantastic visually and even if brief is I feel, a highlight of Part 1.

For the Blu-Ray: The special features are Blu-Ray exclusive, now I don't know why that is. Perhaps Warner thought that those buying the DVD version (which is a LOT) wouldn't like to have bonus features for some reason. The Blu-Ray has a disc devoted to special features only, the extras are a nice touch for fans and I did like them. For instance the 7 Harrys feature was pretty cool and I liked watching the deleted scenes but I probably won't watch the bonuses very often. The digital copy is not on a disc, it's an online download and from what other reviewers are saying it's not ideal because of software download, unwanted software and it isn't the ""safest"" download, let's put it at that. I would've rather had the digital copy on a disc like much of the other Blu releases but that's just a minor complaint.

There are many complaints about the picture quality, especially for the DVD. I own the Blu-Ray/Digital Copy/DVD combo version of Deathly Hallows and I have to admit that these are definitely not the best Blu-Ray or DVD that I've seen. I watched both formats and I think the Blu-Ray looks better in comparison the very dark picture that you get with the DVD. I watched the movie in theaters when it was released and I don't remember it to be this dark. I don't know what it is but Warner Bros managed to screw up the picture quality for this movie, perhaps this will be corrected in the not too distant future with a boxed set of the 8 movies?

I really enjoyed the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; it's a nice addition to the series and set the viewers for what should be a fantastic conclusion. It's hard to believe 2011 marks the 10 year anniversary of the first movie and the franchise! I can't wait to see Part 2 as I think Part 1 set us up so nicely for it! Now, as much as I love the movie I can't give this Blu-Ray/DVD release 5 star because of the picture transfer but those who are not too preoccupied by the darker picture quality should still go for it. 4/5 stars, minus 1 star for the visuals.",1303084800,2,3855,4.285322359396433
3817770,4,B001UV4XI8,"This installment is definitely darker than the rest of them, and it works. This one is not for the hardcore nerds, or kiddies, but rather those into the characters and drama. Standouts are Harry and Hermione, who take this movie to the next level with their interaction and angst. There were definitely some Mulder/Scully moments there. Cinematically, this was also the strongest; with a more adult feel.",1303084800,2,404,5.044776119402985
3817771,5,B001UV4XI8,"I rented HARRY POTTER last night (Sunday, first weekend of availablity, so very heavy useage.) I watched the movie LATE, about 3am on the east coast, so I had none of the problems when overuse will lock up the signal. (I had the film streaming into my one year old laptop from a wifi hooked into a high speed phone line modem. From the laptop, I ran a hookup to a 32"" LCD TV.) People worried about lockup of the picture during high demand times,  might try to download the film instead of streaming it, at a time when you KNOW the peak use is down. AS FOR THE DARK SCREEN, i encountered that the first time I rented a video on demand. I had bought INCEPTION from AMAZON, and got a free rental of the film. COOL! SO, i started the film, and my screen was mostly just...DARK. I could hear the opening music, but nearly no picture. I tried to fix it on the LCD TV, but that didn't help. THE FIX FOR A DARK SCREEN. IF you look at the top of your laptop/computer (I'm running windows 7) you will notice TOOLS. Click on, and you will notice COMPATABILITY VIEW on the list of options.  CLICK ON COMPATIBILITY VIEW. This lightened up the picture, to normal viewing. NOW, as for pixelation. I believe that's an artifact of the limits of transmission. When you have a ""DARK"" movie, it can be annoying, tho I only ""noticed"" the problem at first. Your eyes or brain will adjust. I don't have the option to rent videos, because my small city has NO VIDEO STORES, except for grocery store video kiosks. Let's be realistic. If you want HI DEF/ blu-ray reception, you cant get that via Video on demand. I don't think the servers, or the modems, or even maybe the computer processors, have the power...YET. This is new technology for the most part. WE ALL NEED TO GET USED TO WATCHING FILMS LIKE THIS, cos it IS the future. Just be patient with yourself, and AMAZON, until we all figure out how to get things to work. If you get a black/dark screen, and the FIX VIA ""TOOLS"" at the top of the page, for COMPATABILITY VIEW doesnt work, try to pull your BRIGHTNESS CONTROLL all the way to LIGHT. I think this works via the computer, and the TV as well. I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THE COMING ATTRACTION for the POTTER film, and get this bug ironed out then, if you expect a problem. If the COMING ATTRACTION doesnt look correct, and you don't want to chance it, or your have an older system with a slow processor, simply don't rent the film over the internet.

Now, as for the HARRY POTTER FILM ""DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 1."" I had no problem with the split. HEY, i lived thru LORD OF THE RINGS getting split in ways that drove me up a wall. BUT who is going to watch a 5 hour version of Deathly Hallows, and who wants to see the last book get over edited? The last book is too important. ALSO, ""Harry Potter"" isn't a kid anymore. The films have been dark, since the death at the tournement. I think that was the first REAL death. POTTER 7 has an ORWELL's 1984 vibe, with the way the ministry of Magic was taken over. That was forshadowed when Hogwarts was taken over. ALSO, the 10-12 year olds that liked the first movie/book, are older now. HARRY and company are literally warriors now. They can only expect a warrior's life. AND, we have seen this building for some time in the films. THIS IS A DARK FILM, and not just with the pallet of colors. Its about an orphan, its about evil taking over the world, its about oppression of Moggles (read: jews, blacks, the poor, etc). If your kid is 10 years old, NO WAY is this film for them. YOUNGER KIDS should be allowed to watch the first 3 films, UNTIL THEY GROW UP A BIT.  Unlike the LOTR, this is a very episodic series, that doesnt really depend on the previous book for the plot, UNTIL you reach films #3 or #4. IF this film were NOT dark, it would not have the depth of emotion. THIS IS HARRY POTTER AT WAR, troup movements, living in tents, visiting bombed out buildings and graves, its DARK STUFF for youngsters. HEY...rent MEGAMIND if you want ""LIGHT""entertainment. WELL, lets get ready for JULY, and the LAST FILM, then we can put our elm wands away, and wait for the next BIG THING. (hopefully the Hobbit?)",1303084800,2,4129,4.31701030927835
3817772,5,B001UV4XI8,"I enjoyed the movie as well as I enjoyed all the other Harry Potter movies, but instead of going over all the good points, which all the other 5 star reviews will tell you, I'll just focus on the negative.  You gotta be original somehow.

What's up with all the icky green?  In this movie, nice happy blues, reds, oranges and yellows are not allowed.  Everything must be black, white, brown, gray, or this pale, slightly blue green that's just all over the place.  Check out the cover of the box: those are the only colors you'll see in this movie.  The only exception is in this scene involving the snake Nagini, which was very jarring.  Color palettes do not exist in real life.

The movie does seem too long while watching it at home.  In the theater, it didn't seem to drag so much.  Normally, the second time watching a movie seems to go quicker.  This felt longer.  I'll probably have to fast forward the camping sequence next time I watch it.

It's a little sloppy since there are a few things which are left unexplained, for instance the broken piece of glass which seems to be showing (spoiler deleted) in it.  I guess if I had the books memorized, I'd know what was going on there.  Maybe they'll explain it in part II, but I don't have my hopes up.

Okay, those are my main nit-picks.  It's PG-13, with a not-exactly-kinda-sorta nude scene, so it's not for little kids.

My single disc DVD has ONLY the 5 following deleted scenes:

- The Dursley House: Harry and Aunt Petunia As They Leave House
- The Dursley House: Harry and Dudley Shake Hands
- Ministry of Magic Lifts: Harry Tells Arthur He's Being Tracked
- Tent: Trio Discusses Destroying The Locket
- Montage: Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones
And personally I'm glad these weren't in the theatrical version, as they would have slowed the movie down even further, and the Dudley handshake scene doesn't fit the emotional tone they're setting up.",1303084800,2,1912,4.55425219941349

1. Yes, this is a slow paced movie. It is build-up for the final battle. (An entire movie, mostly bent around one task)
2. Some character you like/love will die. Nuff said there.
3. Some scenes are definately NOT for young children. (Bellatrix scene interrogating Hermione is a good example)
4. Ron...What was he thinking? I don't think a friend, especially one who has been through so much, would act this way. But...that is a personal observation. Would have liked to see more bonding. Not in a weird way but in a best friends way.
5. Not enough Harry and Ginny. I don't know why but they just seem so right together.
6. 146 minutes folks. It is a kind of long movie.
There isn't a lot more to say other than I found it fully enjoyable through multiple viewings over the weekend and as long as you know some of the facts, I hope you will enjoy it too.

3817807,4,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter 7, while a great movie, has a couple of minor flaws that detract from the experience. Some of these issues arise from the MAJOR plotlines left blank in previous series. For example, Bill is forced into the series at the last moment, because whoever directed the 4th and 6th movies thought he wasn't too important. This is similar to the way Ginny was pushed into the 6th movie; I noticed that almost as soon as that movie began, Ginny was noticeably having a much bigger role. Dobby's thread was also forced. Another problem I had was with some of the acting. A good portion of it (Mad Eye Moody, Ms. Weasley) simply feels forced, and unnatural.

But aside from these somewhat minor complaints, this movie looks fantastic. The cinematography is astounding. Previous movies felt a bit closed-in and limited by the walls of Hogwarts, but here the camera is free to roam , and plays a  major role in drawing the viewer in. In the Forest of Dean, when the 'Snatchers' are chasing Harry and co., and just throughout the movie, the cinematics make it so much more enjoyable.

So, I feel like some of the errors from previous movies are starting to catch up to the ending, but the movie is still extremely enjoyable.

Can't wait till July! :D",1303084800,,1248,4.608108108108108

However, even hooked up to an HDTV via HDMI, the resolution was terrible, and tons of shadowboxing, ghosting, and pixelation.  And I don't know if it was how the movie was shot, but the lighting and backdrop colors were HORRIBLE.  Either the scenes were too bright or the skies were some weird, bright pastel color.

This is the first and last time I bother doing a VOD rental.  I'll stick to renting the actual disc.  Glad I didn't pay a thing for it as I had a promotional credit.

OBTW, the movie was okay - still say Prisoner of Azkaban was the absolute best.  Not exactly a fun diversion - I think I chuckled once or twice.  It was all dread, sorrow, anger, and angst the rest of the time.  The big problem with splitting it up in to two movies - it's all lead up, no resolution.

3817811,3,B001UV4XI8,"This review is for the Bly-ray/DVD combo pack.  Buyers should be aware that the only way to watch the special features for DEATHLY HOLLOWS is on the bluray disc.  They are not included on the DVD or digital copy.  As for the special features on the bluray disc, they are okay, consisting of mostly standard featuretts and the maximum movie gimmick that has all sorts of interviews and even readings from the book included while the movie plays.  It's okay but I can't imagine watching it more than once.  Beware of the digital copy as it includes lots of spyware and garbage you may not want on your computer (and the download takes up a mind boggling amount of space).  The transfer of both the bluray and the parts of the DVD that I checked seemed fine to me.  Complaints about the darkness and lack of color in the film seem to be fairly true to the original look of the film and are not really the result of a terrible transfer.  This is however by no means an exceptional looking disc.  Take ""professional"" reviews of discs on sights like HighDef Digest with a grain of salt as negative reviews from them mean repercussions from the studios who send them all sorts of freebies, swag and other forms of ""payment"" for good reviews.  On a well calibrated HDTV above 46 inches the bluray (and upconverted DVD transfer) of DEATHLY HOLLOWS will look fine but it certainly isn't ever going to pop or look colorful (and it isn't supposed to).  There is also some digital noise during a few sequences on the BD and they were more pronounced on the DVD.  There isn't any excuse for it other than slopiness from Warner. As far as the playability issues, they are most likely due to a DRM change at Warner and you will have to do a firmware update to your BD player.  If you have a player more than a couple years old (unless you are using a PS3) you will probably be out of luck and will have to watch the DVD or buy a new BD player.  /  This is a very standard 3 disc release these days which means you get (mostly) the same thing in three different versions.  If you want all the special features the only way to get them is on the BD version.  Walmart has a DVD only version that has special features but it DOES NOT include the maximum movie material which makes up the bulk of the special features. This scenario is becoming more and more common (standard practice for Disney with every release) and if studios make money from it ... it isn't going away any time soon so do your homework before you buy a disc.  It sucks but thats the way things are going.

By the way...the PQ on the DEATHLY HOLLOWS bluray isn't any brighter or more vibrant than the DVD but there is a bit less noise.  THE AQ is noticeably better.  Undoubtedly Warner is saving lots of good stuff for the Ultimate box set edition which will be released after the final film.  Then the Limited Collectors Edition.  Then the Anniversary Edition.  Then the MudBlood Half Prince Hedwig Memorial Edition with collectible film cell made from genuine digital frame capture.  Then the Hagrid's Hut Edition with Keepsake keychain............",1302998400,12,3100,4.473309608540926
3817812,4,B001UV4XI8,"This is a typical Harry Potter movie. If you've seen the others this one falls right in line. Of course, the storyline has matured along with the actors.

The Harry Potter series is all about dark, mysterious, magical things. Hence, some of the scenes in this movie are in the dark woods, in dark castles, etc. The scenes are not bad, too dark, etc. It's suppose to be that way. It falls right in with the script/storyline. Some of the sound effects do drown out the speech and you can't hear what's being said, but you get the gist. This movie is fast-paced, and is full of action and mystery. You get more info about the characters, and there are a few new elements. I enjoyed the background story about the Deathly Hallow men. The characters warping in and out reminds me of ""Inception"", but it works well.

This movie has a bit more violence, sensuality, tragedy, and death than the others did. I wouldn't let young children watch this one - it might be a bit disturbing for them. There is also alot going on - they may have a hard time understanding what is happening.",1302998400,,1073,4.441624365482234
3817832,4,B001UV4XI8,"After the disappointment of HBP, I wasn't real sure that this would be a fitting windup to the HP films.

For the most part, DH1 is a noticeable improvement and a return to the standard set by HP1-4.  There's some dropped stuff (Harry not in disguise at the wedding), some unlikely continutity problems caused by the Cuaron films (look, the Burrow arose from the ashes !)but especially relative to HP6, this follows the story well without amy ""helpful"" additions.

The biggest disappointment in the deleted scenes is the cuts of scenes with the Dursleys.  the scene in the movie (Vernon staring at Harry staring at Vernon) would have ben much more powerful with the inclusion of the scenes with Dudley and Mrs. Dursley.",1302998400,,719,4.821138211382114

The storyline is complex, intriguing and most of all, very Harry Potter! I loved the books (and no, I am not a shut-in, a teenager or a crazy person) and Harry Potter 7.1 is a great film adaptation to the book. Yes, it is a dark thriller and yes, there are some violent scenes, but the movie is well-done and it will have you waiting with bated breath for 7.2.",1302998400,,511,4.224489795918367

Overall, the graphics and cinematography were great as always. The Sword of Gryffindor scene was exactly how I pictured it when I read the book, same for the scenes in the Ministry of Magic. The most disappointing scene for me, was the imprisonment at Malfoy manor. It could've been much better in my opinion. But I understand it's still considered a kids film.

I still think they did a good job, but I wasn't as 'hyped' about HP7: Part1, as I was with the other previous films. I do think where they chose to end this film was awesome. The very last scene was good. Can't wait for Part 2 :)",1302998400,,769,4.2312925170068025

Maybe its my eyesight - but frankly I could not see much for most of the film.  Either nighttime or in the dark.  Oh well - I listened.  Very disappointed.,1302998400,31,328,3.9692307692307693
3817839,5,B001UV4XI8,"First of all kudos to Amazon for a very quick April 15, 2011 arrival of my shipment.

I will agree with other reviewers that the packaging for the DVD is extremely cheap. The front cover graphics look like a poor photocopy from a bad printer.  Regardless I bought the movie for the DVD itself and will not deduct points for the packaging. The DVD played just fine in my Blu-ray player.

I decided to wait until the last movie is available for purchase before going Blu-ray on the whole set. Based on other reviews about the pixelation of the Blu-ray version that turns out to be a wise bet.

There is no doubt in my mind that this movie will appeal more to the Harry Potter purists who have read every book. I have been disappointed in the later movies regarding how much important detail was omitted from the movies so it stands to reason that I am incredibly delighted with this movie. It beautifully captures the darkness of the time with gorgeous, moody landscapes, captures the draining, debilitating hopelessness Harry, Hermione and Ron feel at various points and slowly builds tension to the sudden abrupt ending.

At the time I watched Deathly Hallows Part 1 in the movie theater I was almost angry at the abrupt ending but when you look at it in context, it does allow the second movie to flow seamlessly from the first Deathly Hallows movie. So I will be watching the first movie again just prior to watching the second movie in July 2011.

The excellent attention to detail in this movie does not translate as well to the casual viewer and my younger daughter who has not read the last three books was a little lost. So I get both points of view about the decision to split the last book into two movies but I'm happy the purists won.",1302998400,5,1745,4.488958990536277

I'm sure that Part Two will be really awesome, because the exciting scenes shown in the trailers are from Part Two, where all the great action appears to be.  The thing I disliked about Part One is they kept on showing them in various tents all over the place.  Boring!!! Oh let's see Harry in a tent in a forest, oh how about a different forest!  Of all the films I actually fell asleep in this one, because of all the repetitive tent scenes.  It wasn't a total bore fest due to the building to the climax, but I thought more time could have been spent with character or plot development rather than yet another tent scene!",1302998400,4,701,4.28030303030303

3817865,1,B001UV4XI8,"Let me first start out that I do not read the books, I just watch the movies. I have always found the movies good entertainment and good movies in which to have children watching. In fact I have always look at the Harry Potter movies as children's movies along the lines of the Wizard of Oz from my day. However this movie was a chore to watch. I keep looking at the time remaining to see when it would end. The acting was amateurish, the lighting terrible and a poor transition to DVD with too much pixilation and a story hard to follow. This movie was too dark, moody and I hate to say it, a little too violent. This is not a movie I would want my kid to watch. It was nowhere in keeping with the genre of the other Harry Potter movies. What a waste of money and time watching this painfully BAD movie. This just seem to be a way for the franchise to cash in on the popularity of the other movies and they could care less if the movie was any good. It is like they just wanted to get something out so they can get the money from the movie and the movie tie-in games. If you don't agree with this assessment fine as this is MY opinion about this movie, Not your opinion! Base on some comments I guess some people still do not GET IT. I am making a opinion on the Movie NOT the book. Very few movies based on books are true to the book. Books take hours to read movies do not! As a movie that is part of the Harry Potter franchise and comparing it to the other Harry Potter movies I think this one is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! I do like all the other movies in the Harry Potter franchise!",1302998400,9,1578,4.060897435897436

So by the time the 7th book came out, J.K. wasn't writing for 11 year olds anymore. I grew up with Harry Potter, I read the books, and own all the films. I was not at all disappointed with the way that this film came out, and of course they had to split it up into two films.

This is without a doubt one of the worst movie transfers I have ever seen.  HORRIBLE!!!  I bought the 2 disc special edition DVD first.  My initial thought was that Warner Bros had purposefully sabotaged the DVD quality in order to provoke people into investing in BluRay, which would then reveal the true potential of quality.  So I returned the 2 disc special edition DVD for the DVD/BluRay combo.  Alas!  The BluRay was just as horrible.  I know it's hard to wait, but I would really encourage people to NOT let Warner Bros make a profit on such a shoddy product: reject this release.  Maybe they will get the hint that with general sales getting lower and lower each year, that they can't just abuse their customers without consequences.",1302912000,19,911,4.515337423312883

That being said, I loved this movie and left the theater wanting more. More back story - More information on what was in this part - More more more. And this is a review of the Blu-Ray/DVD combo and not my thoughts of what they left out. This is a well put together set!

The Blu-Ray features do not disappoint. I'm thrilled with the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" or whatever it is that they call it. It's fantastic to get the additional details, scenes, reminders of previous movies, lines from the books, and trivia. I love the way that they supply the information too.",1302912000,,769,4.2312925170068025
3817871,5,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter has always been one of my favorite books series. It is, by no means, a ""children's"" story but one of the most wonderful literary works ever written, with some of the best character development, moral lessons and meaningful themes found in fiction. For this reason, Harry Potter has attracted and continues to attract millions of fans of all ages, genders and nationalities. Deathly Hallows is no exception; it has always been my favorite book in the HP series and is now one of my favorite movies. Period.

Unlike the previous film installments in the series, Deathly Hallows-Part 1 provides an exploration of characters, as well as an emotional build-up to the conclusion; it stands in a league of its own. Everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack is well done and quite true to the book. For me, it's a complete transformation--one that makes me feel like I'm watching a movie that's part of a different series altogether.

I have read several reviews of Deathly Hallows here and on other sites. Though most are quite favorable, there are a few that criticize different aspects of the movie. Though I can understand certain people disliking the plot or pacing, I completely disagree about the criticisms about the performances.  In my opinion, the trio's acting, particularly that of Rupert Grint, was excellent.  There are specific scenes such as the fight in the tent, the destruction of the Horcrux, Ron's return speech and Malfoy Manor that are spot-on. The performances in the past HP films might be considered mediocre by some, and that's fine; however, this should not be the case with Deathly Hallows.

When this movie came out, I was a bit nervous as to how it would turn out. Needless to say, I was so pleasantly surprised that I ended up coming back to see it several times while it was playing in theaters.

3817874,5,B001UV4XI8,"The Harry Potter films continue to get better with each succeeding film for me. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I"" is the action thriller of the Potter films. Fans already know what's going to happen and for those who don't I'm not going to spoil it except to state up front that the film doesn't have a conclusion but ends on a great cliff hanger.

The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good--the image is crisp and true to the theatrical presentation of the film. The look of the film is much more subdued with colors that are often muted to reflect the much more serious and dangerous elements of the story.

The audio sounds terrific with a strong 5.1 lossless mix.

The DVD that is included has a substandard transfer. I'm not sure what Warner has thinking here as many people will just be buying the DVD (perhaps they were thinking that most folks would be watching the show on their car DVD players to keep the kids occupied).

Special features include a featurette on shooting the scene for the seven Harrys. We also get ""Maximum Movie Mode"" the interactive feature that acts as a commentary track taking you behind-the-scenes of the movie while you're watching it.

We also get a promotional featurette on the creation and opening of the theme park in Florida. There are a number of deleted scenes which while they don't necessarily add to the film per se do give us some additional character moments. There's also a featurette on the cast playing golf (!)which seemed kind of stretching. There's also a featurette on the recording of the soundtrack.

There isn't a disc with a digital copy for those who use such things--you have to download the digital copy of the film. Demerits to Warner for advertising it on the package which implies that there is a digital copy disc inside which is a bit misleading. This isn't the first itme Warner has done this with the digital downloads--they did this also for a season of ""Supernatural"".

The film certainly deserves five stars--it's a terrific, entertaining and thrilling ride. The transfer for the Blu-ray is stellar and the extras including the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" are good if not as exceptional as I'd liked (I'm assuming they're saving material for one of those ""Ultimate"" boxed sets).

For those that are interested Best Buy has an exclusive Blu-ray disc that includes two featurettes that take you behind-the-scenes including the scene set in Picadilly and the location shooting of the film. Some of the interviews are recycled from other material on the set but there's also footage that isn't included in any of the other featurettes.

Anything but a mature work, HPATDH plays as if it were written by an untalented teenager, with no sense of pacing, character, or where to place emphasis.
The movie also suffers from a severe case of tonal inconsistency, mixing bad comedy with eye-rolling melodrama. And should I mention the effects? No, let's be nice. Let's just say I have the strong suspicion that most of the budget ended up in the actor's pockets.

When it arrived in the mail yesterday from Amazon, I had to re-check the return address because I thought it was a bootleg copy that had been sent by mistake.  The sound and picture quality are sub-par as well.

I learned from reading the comments to other one-star reviews here that the sort of DVD release we have come to expect for a Harry Potter film (two-discs, widescreen, etc.) is only available from Walmart. Had I known, I would not have wasted my money signing up for a pre-sale from Amazon. Unfortunately, I opened it, so I can't send it back.

After watching it, I can say I am still not happy with the adaptation of this film from its source.  For all its length, it is dreadfully paced, seeming simultaneously rushed and draggy, and it has left out at least as many important themes and scenes as any of the earlier films.  Scenes are added willy-nilly, too, which is not in and of itself a crime, but only a crime when the tacky new material replaces the brilliant original.

Steve Kloves is no J.K. Rowling, and should stop trying to ""improve"" on the better writer's work.

******SPOILER AHEAD******

The film cuts an important scene that is one of the first in the book, and that is the tete-a-tete between Harry and Dudley as the Dursleys depart from Privet Drive. That scene would have added so much more to the film in terms of character development than the film's made-up opening scene of Hermione erasing herself from her parents' photos and memories. Much has been made of that Hermione scene, but I was not impressed and thought it raised more questions than it answered. In the book, Hermione mentions in conversation how she transported her parents to Australia, changed their names, and wiped their memories clean of the idea they had ever had a daughter. In the movie, it seems that the parents remain in their English house. So what happens when the neighbors ask the Grangers about their daughter? Or did Hermione supposedly perform memory charms on all the neighbors, too? And how does simply wiping the parents' memories supposedly protect them -- or Hermione -- anyway; aren't they still vulnerable to Death Eaters who might want to hurt them in order to hurt Hermione, regardless of whether they remember her?

I am tired of people going on about how this scene brought tears to their eyes. I am as sentimental as anyone can be, but I found the scene bogus. For an authentic emotional statement, give me Dudley and his handshake and his ""Dunno"" and his teacup.",1302912000,19,2690,4.632352941176471

On another note, the movie looks great in HD, but they left such large bars at the top and the bottom of the screen.  It is not bad, but it is like the old days when you would watch a Widescreen movie on a full screen unit.

I have a question about what the special features (mainly the trailer for the next movie) are...  After watching the movie on the  ""Movie: Blu-Ray"" disk, I went to Special Features and there was only an option for watching the movie in different manners.

This unfortunately does not work in the film's favor, precisely because the trend of the last few films was to dispense with a great deal of material from the books (and consequently improve upon them) in favor of giving us films which were incoherent as a series but which, for the most part, stood well on their own aesthetically.  And while this more impressionistic style of film-making didn't sit well with the Harry Potter purists, cinematically it was very respectable.  Now, however, the filmmakers have decided to give the purists what they want . . . to the detriment of the film, not least because Deathly Hallows the novel was such a mess to begin with.",1302825600,2,881,4.745098039215686

But why are there no options for special features for DVD buyers? I was looking forward to purchasing a special edition two disc DVD loaded with special features for a fan like me, only to realize the only feature was additional scenes. No behind the scenes footage. No preview for the upcoming movie. No-that's only for people with a Blu Ray player. You think with the economy the way it is WB would realize many people can't afford higher priced products like a Blu Ray player, and it's unfair to make all the good features exclusive to that disc.

3817923,1,B001UV4XI8,"Note: This is not a rating on the movie itself, this is on the Warner Brothers (WB) misleading packaging suggesting the digital copy is included.

I got the 3 pack and of course paid extra for it but when it arrived there were 3 DVD's but no digital copy, the 3rd DVD is just special features, of which the digital copy is not one of them.

If you look at the cover or product description is says Three-Disc-Combo Blu-ray / DVD Combo + digital copy. Don't know about you but when I see three disc combo, and that description I assumed the three listed on cover and description are actually in the package, it isn't, instead the 3rd disc is the Special Features. I got the TRON combo pack, which said it had a digital copy and it really did...

Very misleading in my opinion, but wait, it gets worse.

When I went to Download it, you can't even just download the movie, it makes you download a 510MB Installer (bigger than the Windows 7 Installer!). Once you have the installer it just gets worse as it then tries to make you take WB Digital Movie Manager even if you pick the option just for the movie.

When I saw all of the junk it wanted to install I aborted out of it. So if you wanted the digital copy without a terabyte of overhead and garbage installed on your computer I would skip this deal and just get the movie without the junk.

I like my digital copies on DVD, never saw this scam before, the WB application basically wants to take over your movie collection and report all of your movies back to WB, there are so many things wrong with that idea I will not even start, just say, Warner Brothers must be out of their mind and planning to dupe a bunch of kids. To date this is the most shamefull packaging of a Movie deal I have ever seen.

The kicker is that if you do not agree to the totally unreasonable terms you get no digital copy. If I wanted to share the contents of my movie collection with WB I would send them an email with the list, nor will I install an application where I have no control or view in to what it is sending home, it should be illegal to put spyware like that on your system but the agreement makes you give them permission to hunt around on your PC and pass the information back to WB.

So sad they pull this on anyone but you know this will end up on tons of PC with unsuspecting users piling more junk on their PC and WB Exclusive spyware. This is a good package to avoid unless you have to have the digital copy of this at any cost.

If you opt for the iTunes version and not the Windows version you are not forced to take the WB manager, but you are then stuck with only being able to play it on systems with iTunes.",1302825600,71,2663,4.145348837209302

I find it sad that people's ignorance and stupidity has to diminish the rating of this fabulous movie. Yes I know the ratings on Amazon really don't matter, but I really bothers me.

So to the reviewer that gave the movie 2 stars for not completing the Dobby's Burial scene and explaining Harry's choice between the Horocrux's and the Hallow's, you might like to know that is only Part 1. There is a freaking reason why they split the movie into 2 parts, that is because there were things that could not be pushed into a single film. Ever think they might address that in Part 2?

And to that person who rated the movie 1 star because he claimed he couldn't review the movie because he hadn't watched it yet, then why did you write that in the form of a review with 1 star?

Finally, to the person who states that it was a failure because he is a huge fan and it didn't meet his expectations, so he was going to leave the Harry Potter series, I wouldn't call that being such a huge fan.

3817929,3,B001UV4XI8,"Listen, we are big Harry Potter fans at our house. Everyone has read the books, seen the movies (at least on DVD) and listened to the audio books. We were really, really looking forward to seeing this movie.

When we saw the PG-13 rating we sent our eldest son to preview it before we took the rest of the family (kids 11-8). This young adult came back from the theater saying that it was absolutely not for the kids. His biggest complaint: the nude scene of Harry and Hermione. (The scene is in page 376 in the book. Rowling never states they are undress. Why add it to the movie?See comment below) His other scene he found too disturbing for the kids was when Bellatrix tortured Hermione.

My husband and I saw the movie (without kids) and found it to be so-so. The movie was at its best when more characters than just Harry, Rom and Hermione were on screen. Looking forward to seeing Part 2.

Additional comments/clarifications:

I am surprised at the number of comments this review evoked and feel I need to clarify some of my remarks and respond to some of the comments list below this review.

1. I did see this movie. My 19 year old son went to the midnight showing opening night. My husband and I attended the following evening.
2. I actually have not read other reviews. I guess I knew I was going to this movie whether other people liked it or not.
3. It is true that the nude scene consists of Harry and Hermoine's bare shoulders, with smoke covering the rest of them. They are entwined in an embrace. It is not a scene most parents of elementary age kids (or at least this parent) finds appropriate and it probably contributed a great deal to the pg-13 rating. (OK, that and Nagini indwelling Bathilda Bagshot)
  Here is the thing, in the later Harry Potter books there is some snogging (kissing for you non-Brits), but J.K. Rowling choose not to go beyond that. I simply wished the filmmaker took the same route.
4. Yes, we all know the books mature as Harry get older. They get darker as well. Still, filmmakers were able to make a PG rated movie out of book 6,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B002PMV9FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)</a>/(as well as books 1-3). I guess I was hoping for the same for Deathly Hallows, Part 1.

Look, there were some great performances and moments in this movie. My personal favorite was Jason Issacs performance as Lucius Malfoy. He managed to communicate much with saying very little.

I hope that helps clarify my earlier review. I would encourage anyone reading this review to read the comments below, as this forum is all about respectfully sharing our opinion and being free to differ.",1302652800,3,2792,4.8734177215189876
3817930,4,B001UV4XI8,"I want to make it clear that, on the whole, the film itself was, I think, a success.  I think it may be one of, if not the best film in the franchise thus far.

The choice to split the final story into two parts paid off; the details, nuances that cropped up throughout the film were all possible because the film had time to work them in.  Even things that might have escaped the notice of people who didn't read the books, they're there for those of us who did (i.e. Hermione's reference to perfume; the perfume Ron gave her for her birthday).  I also firmly believe that the kids, the stars (Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Felton, etc.) have never given better performances.  They clearly handled this film (and, likely, its companion due out next year) with extreme care.  It shows, and I, for one, am grateful.

I've heard several reviews that say the film is laden down with too much plot, too many devices, details and new information, but that's hardly its own fault; the book presents all of those things originally.  Yes, the book had more pages than the film has screen time, but considering how much the book introduces here in the home stretch, how many new things have to be incorporated and made known, it seemed to work well.  Things got cut, and things got altered, but in ways that worked and, in the end, leaves us with a film that is gripping and heartfelt.

If this production was a Hogwarts end-of-year feast, in the main it would be very tasteless and dry. Steve Kloves, the screenwriter, is to disappointing as emo-folks are to sad. I wasted sixty-five bucks on part 1 (I thought it would be a good family activity) but the franchise won't get another dime. I'll probably donate this same amount to the suicide crisis center in my city because I am sure those who endure part 2 may be calling said hotline.

But then again, we're a few of the biggest HP fans ever.

First of all, yes, it DID leave out and/or change quite a few important scenes. (Dudley's revelation, Kreacher's revelation, Wormtail's death, etc.) But, on the other hand, I understand that you can't include everything from the book in the movie. If you have not read the books (Shame on you, by the way, JK Rowling is an INCREDIBLE author!) I suggest you see it with someone who has, because you will likely be confused.

On the other hand, it had some brilliant scenes that the book did not, like George interupting the H/G kiss, and Ron and Hermione playing the piano (Awwww). Overall, I really loved this movie, and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD.

3817945,2,B001UV4XI8,"Since there is so many great reviews already written, I will just give a brief suggestion.  I've read all the books at least three times each and never get bored and actually have discovered a new detail I missed before.  It's like a treasure.  I think why this movie, as well as the Half Blood Prince fail us is because the lack of important dialogue!  Seriously the beauty of the Harry Potter series is all the discussion between the characters that draw us in and make us a part of the story.

A small example in this movie of lost valueable script: In the book, when Harry is digging the grave for Doby, he is making the most important decision between Horcux or Hallows(hense the tittle of the book!)but in the movie there was no reference to it.  I saw the movie with my family, that have not read the book but are fans of the stories and movies, were absolutely lost when the movie shows Harry digging the grave and ""He who must not be named"" taking the wand from Dumbledore.  Couldn't the movie producers added a short conversation among Harry, Ron and Hermanie explaining that?  Really they added a bunch of other parts that are absolutely meaningless, like the dance scene.  Through the whole movie I had to constantly explained what was going on so the movie would make sense to everyone else.  It was so disappointing, and they too lost interest in watching the movie.

It's so simple.  All the last two movies really needed to make them as great as the first three was more dialogue!  I'm not even sure we're going to bother to go to the theatre for the final film.  We'll just wait for in it to go on DVD.  I'm tired of the emptiness in the films when the books give so much more.",1302048000,14,1694,4.384615384615385

Over the years the book to movie transition has steadily declined with this series and here the story is almost unrecognizable. I believed, I hoped, that splitting this book into two parts the powers that be would use the time to set right what they had failed in the other movies. To go back and explain key elements of the story and characters that they had glossed over before. But no, what they did was give us two hours of post-apocalyptic feely-type imagery and 3 teenagers roaming witlessly around the english countryside apparently without a clue between them - and very little magic either. JK Rowling wrote pages of clever dialogue in which these characters wrestle with their deepest fears and struggle with the smallest of clues that Dumbledore left them to unravel in order to defeat Voldemort. They planned and discussed and sacrificed. Harry went head to head with the minister of magic on moral principal. It took Harry months to convince Hermione to go to Godric's Hollow. But in the movie they do everything on a whim. It's all based on luck. Yates makes them look like idiots. This is the thing I find most offensive. And for a movie based on a magical world it seemed oddly lacking in magic. The Sorcerer's Apprentice had more magic in the first 5 minutes than the entire HP film. I will see the final installment because I need to finish this, but I am sorely disappointed. It's like watching a Cliff's notes version of a book you love. The heart and soul of the story is missing. The characters have been reduced to their lowest common denominators. If you haven't read any of the books do yourself a favor and don't start now.

The tension throughout the movie was constant and high. About midway through the film when our heroes were beset once again with trouble, it thought ""ho, hum, there's another set back.""

But this film not only advances the roles of the existing cast, but brings back certain roles and makes the movie that much better.  Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint just blew me away with this installment.  All three of them came back with an edgier attitude and added more maturity to their characters.  I enjoyed seeing all three grow from Sorceror's Stone to the final film. The obvious gradual improvment makes this series perhaps one of the best if not the best film in history in terms of novel-based films.  I can't wait for part II in July!",1300492800,2,724,4.6171875

After having been extremely disappointed with the film version of HP and the Half Blood Prince, I sincerely hoped that this film would be better than expected and it did not disappoint. The scene of Hermione wiping her parents memories and leaving home had me in tears in just the first few minutes of the movie. And then just a few minutes later, the death of Hedwig during the flight from Privet Drive brought me to tears again.
This movie included all the important parts of the book while leaving out some of the parts that dragged on a little too long (the many nights on the run in the countryside of England) And the ending of Part I, where Harry, Ron and Hermione are caught by the Snatchers left me breathless with anticipation for Part II.

The acting by all was very good showing frustration and love and admiration, this movie is different from the others as it doesn't make you scream because they added too much that wasn't there and not enough of what was.

3817972,5,B001UV4XI8,"If any popcultural product could be said to have dominated the first decade of the 21st century, it was ""Harry Potter"".  Between 1997 and 2011, the only years that did not see either a new book or film released were 2006 and 2008, and two years (2003 and 2007) had both.  Now, the saga is drawing to a close, with the seventh and final book being split into two films, staggered between the winter of 2010 and the summer of 2011.  At the helm once again is David Yates, who, when all is said and done, will have directed fully half of the films in the series, making his by far the most distinctive directorial imprint (though his borrows quite a bit from Alfonso Cuaron's tenure).  The decision to split the story in two has inspired two different sets of opinion, with some saying it drags things out and other welcoming the extra time.  I fall into the the latter category; the expanded canvas, in my view, allows the story to really breathe in a way that even the best of the preceding films (""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"") did not.  Spoilers follow.

The preceding film ended with the death of Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon), the greatest light wizard in the world.  This is akin to America's nuclear arsenal vanishing midway through the Cold War; any sense of balance of power has vanished, and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is moving quickly to finish the overthrow of the Ministry of Magic and kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the only potential threat to him.  Harry and his two closest friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have a quest of their own:  locate and destroy the four remaining Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort, which will render him mortal at last.  They have, unfortunately, very little sense of how to do this, and when Voldemort's forces come after them, they end up on the run, cut off from most of their allies.

Indeed, isolation is the key theme of this first half of the story.  The previous films were set mainly around Hogwarts, which pointedly does not appear in this film at all.  Most of the supporting cast put in only brief, though usually memorable, appearances towards the start of the movie, and a few, such Professor McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) are absent entirely.  Yates and screenwriter Steven Kloves actually heighten the sense of isolation compared to the novel, where it was already pronounced - between leaving the Weasley residence and visiting Malfoy Manor, our heroes don't encounter a single friendly wizard, whereas in the book they met a few, and the wizard radio broadcasts have become merely a tally of missing or dead wizards.

Thus the weight of the production descends almost entirely on Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, the young actors we've been following for a decade.  By now, these roles fit them like gloves, and they all do the best work of their young careers here.  Watson, who was the highlight of the early films in particular, is amazingly expressive here.  Radcliffe has what is in some ways the blandest role, that of the hero, but he does an excellent job with it.  A frequent fan complaint about previous films was how Ron lost much of his more serious material in favour of comic relief - Rupert Grint finally gets some really meaty dramatic material here (as well as some of his usual good comedy), and shows real skill in his handling of it.  The supporting actors, ranging from other young actors like Evanna Lynch and Matthew Lewis to experienced pros like Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and David Thewlis, all do their usual capable work.  Some, in particular Lewis as Neville, will get their big moments in the second part of the story.  The technical aspects of the production are, as one would expect, flawless.

Highly recommended.  Assuming Part 2 keeps this level of quality, and I see no reason to think it won't, this will go down as the series' strongest entry.",1299110400,6,3902,4.72821270310192
3817973,2,B001UV4XI8,Not your usual Harry Potter movie.  Many scenes were dark and hard to see.  Plot was murky at best.  Hope the sequel is much better.,1299024000,5,132,4.2
3817974,5,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 has the feel of a post-apocalyptic film, as certain scenes draw visual comparisons to the harrowing film The Road with Viggo Mortensen. I am very biased since I grew up reading Harry Potter and I feel I have an allegiance to the material that cannot be broken by any means, which basically implies that this review may not be helpful to people who are non-fans. I am a lover of film and noticed this installment's shortcomings; it had a few. There were some editing mistakes I caught onto in a variety of scenes and certain obscurities in the script. However, these were only mild shortcomings, because the film delivered in almost every other respect. For one thing, director David Yates has developed and has almost mastered his craft as a filmmaker. I remember looking back to his debut film Order of the Phoenix, and observing his shaky work. I really enjoyed that HP film, but I felt as though Yates was failing to take the risks necessary to make an epic fantasy film. His choice of camera angles and shots were too self-contained and his lack of establishing shots and scenes was very apparent. In Half-Blood Prince, it was obvious Yates was beginning to realize the artistic appeal of the series, becoming more focused on delivering an emotionally dense and visually rich summer blockbuster rather than just another daft and forgettable special-effects extravaganza. HBP was a huge step in the right direction, even though I felt that the film's major shortcoming was in its inability to render palpable performances from the younger cast. This was probably due to Yates's orders from producers to go in a more ""romcom"" direction to compete with the uncomparable and lesser Twilight. It was obvious Yates's strong suit was in directing dramatic scenes, not tender, romantic ones.  Regardless, the film delivered and payed respect to the overall spririt of Rowling's work.

However, now, in Deathly Hallows, Yates delivers in more ways than one. For one thing, he creates a film that does not feel like any of its predecessors: it is dark, gritty, and intense. The characters are no longer in the safe haven that is Hogwarts, they are on the run and keeping out of sight from the evil Lord Voldemort and his loyal minions. In the process, they have to find objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul and destroy them; but they have no one to guide them and only the late Dumbledore's hunch to direct their journey. Many critics and audiences alike complained that the film began very well (showcasing an intense action sequence where an army of Death Eaters chase after Harry and his friends in flight), but then began to drag toward the second act. I completely disagree. If you call allowing a movie time for some breathing room, dragging, then our society really has lost its ability to engage in meaningful entertainment. The second act of the film, though slow-paced, showcases not only the acting talents of the main trio, but also demonstrates how strong their friendship is. No other Harry Potter film has had sufficient time to explore these relationships and character dynamics. Yates even allows room for sexual tension to build up between Harry and Hermione, which adds a unique layer to this movie, and gives audiences a lot to speculate about.

Technically, like Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Part 1 delivers. I am surprised it did not at least get nominated for Best Cinematography. Eduardo Serra's ability to measure the camerawork so that it is shaky enough when it needs to be yet subtle when it is essential, is unparalleled; and Yates's decision to work with Serra makes me respect him even more, because it is obvious Yates is an experimental filmmaker, and he will work with a crew that will help present a vision that is true to the source material. Each of his HP adaptations have had a uniformity in their own right, and each one seems so different. Even technically, there are major differences between Ootp, HBP, and DH Part 1. Just observe the color palettes, the cinematography, the art direction, and the framing. DH is so great because Yates has realized that Rowling's story is about young adults who understand the pangs and experiences of any of us muggles. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are not caricatures of real people; they represent real people, exhibiting emotions that are universal. As a result, the visual style of DH Part 1 is very gritty and immersive, allowing us--the audience--to observe the magical, relevant, and relatable themes occuring on the screen, presented in a way in that the magical world of Harry Potter seems not so different from our own.",1298937600,3,4656,4.883691529709229
3817975,5,B001UV4XI8,"Despite being a loyal Harry Potter fan I definitely was left disappointed by the films. Many of worthy parts were ommitted while some could've been done without. This movie alone was closer to the book than all 6 prior movies combined. To all hating reviews, I am aware of the lack of action and all the walking, but anyone who read the book I imagine would be as thrilled as I was. I can't wait for part 2!",1298851200,2,407,4.230769230769231
3817976,5,B001UV4XI8,"I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire!

Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the ""TWO movies? [...] that"" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.

Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.

I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.

Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.

In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!",1298592000,2,2152,4.343283582089552

3817978,5,B001UV4XI8,"Hard to believe this is the beginning of the end for this series. But what a way to go out! As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I was utterly dissapointed at the last two films. They strayed so far from the source material, I was quite honestly shocked and truly feared for the rest of he series. Well, I am pleased to say that Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is near perfection. High praise, yes, but I truly felt it did the book (at least the first part) justice. People have been complaining that not much happens and it is very slow-moving. Well, yes it is, but again, that is not so different from the book. The first part is a journey and sort of a teaser for the grand finale. Though not much action occurs, it is still quite interesting and truly suspensful. Especially if you've never read the books(which is just astonishing to me since they are a million times better than the movies).

The characters are so grown up now and with that comes so much more emotion, and drama. The Half-Blood Prince contained too much humour, I thought. But Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 contains just the right amount of everything. All the actors do an incredible job, even Dan Radcliffe, who I've always seen as the weakest link in the series. He's truly developed as an actor and did a wonderful job here. You can really feel the struggle these characters are going through on their journey.  It is just Harry, Ron and Hermione alone in the wilderness, trying to keep some sort of composure during their grim endevor. I do have to say one thing though: My favorite character in the series, Severus Snape, has literally one scene. I was extrememly dismayed but can only hope for more in the second part. Even with that one scene, he steals the show.

The imagery is fantastic, the musical score is just right, the cinematography is first-rate. Aside from a couple of odd scenes, which were not in the book, I could really find nothing to complain about. I'm glad they decided to split the book, I think it was the best decision for this film and the entire series.",1298332800,3,2052,4.452127659574468

I thought it was brilliantly made and this was one of those movies that are so good that you don't look to see what time it is and you don't wonder ""is this almost over?"".

3817980,2,B001UV4XI8,"Let me preface this by saying that I have not liked a Harry Potter movie since Chamber of Secrets, the last one that Chris Columbus directed. Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets truly felt magical, filled with spells, unusual creatures, and wizards' robes. You really felt like you were in fantasy world. Understandably, as the series progresses the tone gets less happy and sparkly, and more ominous and gloomy. I don't think that should mean the magic factor has to be downplayed, or at least keep them in wizard garb. From Prisoner of Azkaban on they all look just like like regular kids at some boarding school in Europe, who just happen to have wands. Most of them shouldn't even know what muggle clothes look like, let alone sport the latest fashions.

I did myself a disservice by rereading the book right before seeing the movie. As a total HP geek I of course want the movies to retain all details, but I realize that each movie would have to be about eight hours long for that to be possible. While reading there were many times where I thought, I wonder how they'll translate this info to film, and turns out their answer was to simply cut it. In the book we learn a great deal about Dumbledore's past, his family, and his connection to Grindelwald - the great dark wizard before Voldemort. The movie glosses over these things, mentioning them in passing without explanation. Instead they chose to waste time by drawing out the camping trips and adding in extraneous scenes like an impromptu dance session between Harry and Hermione. They also didn't have the kids using the Invisibility Cloak at all, while in the book they spent practically all their time traveling under that thing. While I can see from a cinematic standpoint that you can't have your main characters invisible for most of the film, it seemed like a strange thing to leave out entirely since the Cloak is actually one of the Deathly Hallows. I was, however, really impressed with the animation of the fable, The Three Brothers. For a moment I was afraid they were just going to have Hermione sit there and read it to us, but the little cartoon was a nice break in the film and was very artistic. It was surprising to me how gory this film was; they showed George's damaged ear and Ron's splinching in all their bloody glory, and even The Three Brothers tale (a children's story) was quite grisly and grim. I guess they didn't rate it PG-13 for nothing.

Throughout the movie, I couldn't get over how old the kids looked. It feels weird to even call them ""kids."" Harry has a perpetual five 'o clock shadow, Ron is gargantuan, and Hermione seems to have fallen out of a J. Crew catalog.  All in all, it wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't great either. There were definitely a lot of moments that I enjoyed, but I think too many important details were left out or changed that I can't reasonably give this a good review.

3817992,2,B001UV4XI8,"I thought David Yate did a terrible job in HP 7( and i thought the sixth movie was the worst, boy was i wrong). there was no sense of emotion, no sense of danger. And where was the soundtrack? there was barely any soundtrack in the movie, you need music to convey some kind of emotion. The way the director did the action scene ( the fighting in the sky) was barely recognizable. I didn't know what was going on. The music to that scene was so off that it puzzled me why the director would go that route instead of a more sinister and intense music. This is why John Williams should have scored the entire movie ( The studio should have paid him double, no triple to keep him rather than let him go). Anyways, after watching DH part 1, there is no hope that DH part 2 would be any better. I truly think that David Yates has destroyed a franchise that could've lasted for decades to come.
Oh, forgot one thing: Dobby's death was done so terribly. I felt more sad for cedric dying in Movie 4 than Dobby. Again barely any score was played for him. And then they randomly decided to add Luna to the scene. I'll conclude that the studio obviously is being as cheap as possible in order to increase their profit margin for these films. You could tell that they didn't want to hire a talented director along with talented composer and use the top notch special effect to make these films much better. They know if they make a poor or at best mediocre film that fans would pour into the theaters just to see what they read come to life. They know regardless of the outcome of the product, people would at least see the movie one time. In the short-run this would gain them ample amount of money but in the long-term, the future generation would see how crappy the film are and just might skip it all together. *sigh* it's really a pity that such a franchise that started good has come to such mediocre ending. I gave it two stars because some of the acting were good ( not just from the trio) and ""the tale of the three brothers"" scene. Not for the ministry scene( wasn't suspenseful enough or have the feel like evil has taken over the ministry), or the wedding scene ( a bit too casual instead of tension, No krum, but loved Luna and her father silly dance), or the forest scenes ( too long, should have used those minutes on other scenes like adding Krum discussing about the deathly hallow or when harry and friends were trapped at Malfoy's Manor instead of rushing that scene) or.....

Plus, for once the book readers and the only-movie watchers are semi-satisfied. That's sort of a guarantee. Things are missing, things are modified to make them ""cooler"" but it works.

Hollywood has to change things like they intend to with the next movie and Snape's scene, but that so that the same feelings we felt from reading the book can be felt in a movie. You can't translate things exactly the same from book to screen and make people understand and believe and feel it.

This movie is well worth the leap of faith.

The kids are out of Hogwarts now, and while that could have backfired on them, it worked really well. Everything really worked really well. They are much more experienced actors and it shows. The trio in particular are completely fabulous in this one.

I'll be buying this version, on blue-ray, merely because it was THAT good. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for roughly eleven years now, and I was not at all disappointed. Ended up watching this movie twice in theaters, which I have never done.

The effects are not cheesy, even the ""shield"" or ""protection"" magics, and its pretty clear to anyone; it doesn't skip too many things that the ""only-movie watchers"" need to know. Did I have to explain a few things to the guy next to me that kept taking me away from the movie? Sure. But I have to admit, I had to explain a great deal less than what I thought they'd cut out.

Worth buying and watching again and again. Best Harry Potter movie yet.",1297209600,2,1612,4.429054054054054
3818011,2,B001UV4XI8,"After all the defending I have done in the past of the HP movies, I think I deserve better.  The books are highly evolved AND involved, way too much content to try and cram into a cluster of a movie.  I thought movies 1-6 were incredibly done and I fought tooth and nail with ""real"" fans who thought they were so cool because they had read the books before the movies even came out and would bash everyone who liked the movies because the ""movies left too much out"".  But this movie, I will NOT defend in the same way.

Why?  Because it is garbage made with one purpose and that is this: $$$.  Lets see how we can keep our costs low and our earning high.  I thought the purpose of splitting this story into 2 movies was so that it could be exceptionally detailed and leave it all on the floor for the finale.  This is the closer for freaking Harry Potter, both movies could have been 3-4 hours long and people would have never even blinked the whole time!  Don't say you couldn't do more because you didn't have the right time frame.

The entire story is rushed.  Key events are left out (Krum and Harry's talk at the wedding, Kreature's major role, the insight to the Deathly Hallows) or changed, such as the scene with Wormtail.  That was an incredible part in the book, why did we just simply knock him out?!  It seems like the characters are uncomfortable with their lines and just trying to blurt them out as quickly as possible.  My heart was racing for the chase scene in the beginning but that was the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen!  When I read the Deathly Hallows and Hagrid fell from his broom, I was sure he was dead.  Everything pointed that direction, and when he was found to be alive, it was like the 2nd coming to me. But in this movie?  Oh no, lets cut that out so we can put Bill in here saying ""Hi, my name's Bill, I was attacked by a werewolf"", no better way of getting some back story than that huh?

I bet Rowling is pissed.  Sources tell me she has a history of being unhappy with the movies, especially for downplaying the elves and after what they did to Kreature I'm sure she'd like to come down with the hammer of the gods.  Please I beg you before watching this, if you have not read the books READ THEM so people like me aren't having to sit there with a whole group of people and explain every freaking detail because the POS movie left out most every important fact that you need to know!

Someone answer me this question, who was the cool looking snatcher guy with the long hair?  See, I read the book and I don't even know who that is!  Can someone please PLEASE reboot this movie?  Hell we are redoing Spider-Man, why not give a little more forethought into a work of literature that has pretty much been a major history mark for a generation?

Did this movie really not deserve a little more thought and time?  Did we really have to rush it?  I will say that yes, there is a lot of downtime in the book that wouldn't have been interesting enough for movie scenes but come on!!! Part 2 better be the best movie ever made or then I will know for a FACT these movies were made with the all mighty dollar sign in eyes and I will forever lose faith in novel adaptations.

This movie is OK for people who haven't read the books but I think even Potter fans that have never read a book in their life will notice this just isn't up to par.  I'm buying it simply to finish out my collection.  I give this movie 2 fingers WAY WAY up.",1297123200,32,3469,4.204236006051437
3818012,4,B001UV4XI8,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the best book in the Harry Potter book series and one of the best books I have ever read.  Likewise, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is (so far) the best movie in the Harry Potter movie series.  As of this writing, I am confident that Part 2 will finish the saga nicely, and it will join the ranks of Part 1, to be better than all of the other 6 movies.  (Whether Part 1 or Part 2 is better than the other is less important.)  But my main complaint right now is:

Why is the DVD of Part 1 being released before Part 2's theatrical release?  I expected and hoped that Part 1 would not be on DVD until Part 2 was also ready to be on DVD, and that the two would be released in one DVD as ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" without it having to bother with a ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2,"" or maybe with some minor note mentioning ""Parts 1 & 2 together.""  Either way, I will not own any Harry Potter DVD until all seven episodes (all eight movies) are together in one consistent DVD collection (hopefully including both parts of HP7 in one case within the collection).",1297036800,,1114,4.12962962962963
3818013,5,B001UV4XI8,"I have judged and ridiculed every single Harry Potter film because I have read the books since I was 8, and now here we are at the end. While book 7 is filled with sooo much information, any things left out comprising the first half I think we were able to do without. Obviously movies will not be as good as books, they never are, but this film did a really good job on sticking with the script. After it was over I was pleased and of course sad about Dobby and all of that. It did happen like I imagined it would and overall I think Yates did an exceptional job. As for the actors, Dan, Emma, and Rupert all did extraordinary, and I loved the added scene of Emma in her 'muggle home,' very sad. I loved new people brought in (Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans) and I thought they did great portraying their characters. Obviously this film lacked some action because a lot of it was tying loose ends together, but all the action we will see in this next installment, which will prove the be the saddest and most heart-wrenching of them all. Coming from someone who has reread this final book 7 times, I found it to be complete and explanatory. If you haven't watched the other films recently or only halfheartedly paid attention you might misunderstand or just not understand some things, but if it was all nicely laid out for us and didn't require any thought whatsoever then...well, we'd just call it Twilight. I give this 5 stars and anxiously await the final film to see how this grand finale turns out.",1297036800,3,1497,4.388489208633094
3818014,5,B001UV4XI8,"I have previously been relatively unsatisfied with some of the movies due to a combination of poor script adaptation, suffering CG sequences or lack of acting prowess from a number of principal actors.  ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"", however, is one of the only Harry Potter movies I walked away from without feeling it was incomplete in the way I felt about some of the other films. I was actually very satisfied with the end result, even with the changes it had, and felt strongly enough about it to see it again another 4 times.  There are obvious limitations when bringing a book to life on the big screen like budget problems and time constraints, actor availability, finding suitable and affordable filming locations and hiring a CGI company with the chops to get the job done.  I thought this movie addressed the shortcomings in prior films because most of what I saw I thought was done exceedingly well, both on the part of the crew and the actors.

PROS:

Nearly everything in this movie conveyed a sense of impending doom and haunting depression, even the rusted and dilapidated WB logo at the start of the film.  That sense of malcontent and sadness has been a big source of criticism from some, mostly those who have not read the book and don't understand that the feeling of hopelessness is canon in a majority of the plot.  That said, I found it to be appropriate, even if a little exhausting at some parts such as the times where we see Harry and Hermione slowly gathering their things, without speaking to each other, getting ready to change locations, just to set up again without speaking.  This movie is about a war and, although it's primarily viewed on the periphery, war is never happy.  Relationships are severely tested and splintered in this installment, but such is the life of someone who has been tasked with a near-impossible job, with limited knowledge of how to handle and complete the task, with the added burden of having few allies to turn to, no family and no contact with friends, all while being hunted by a racist, fascist government.  It's not exactly a walk in the park for Harry, so to those who are criticizing the gloominess of the movie, try to keep that perspective in mind.  The book conveys those feelings of overwhelming depression well and I think the movie does as well as it can, without the help of the creative exposition that is the luxury of the written word.

I thought the crew did an excellent job setting the tone of scenes with lighting and camera angles and finding gorgeous filming locations that took my breath away.  They were far more beautiful, unique and - more poignantly - much lonelier than I pictured in my head when I read the book; that to me was one of the things that contributed heavily to the sadness the heroes felt.  This was also one of the few things that I thought the movie did better than book.  And I don't say that lightly or very often.

The relationships between the characters are so very strained the whole novel; I felt this was handled well in the movie, though I confess it was something I was very worried about going in.  Prior to this movie, there haven't been many opportunities for our heroes to express and sustain emotions as powerful and deep as the emotions they experience in this novel, and I while I've enjoyed the previous movies, I've always felt the actor's abilities (especially those of our 3 heroes) left something to be desired and I wasn't sure they could hack the more intense emotional scenes.  I was relieved to find that they did very well in many of the major scenes, such as the big fight that sends Ron packing.  I was so happy with the way this scene went, nearly word for word faithful to the book and acted wonderfully by Grint and Radcliffe.  Another favorite was the scene when was Ron is Splinched coming out of the Ministry.  I about cried the first time simply because of Watson's feeling during that ordeal, it was very impressive.  Also, her performance in the scene at Malfoy Manor was incredibly unnerving.  That scene was difficult to watch and had a few people around me covering their eyes.

Harry's birthday was cut out entirely, which I'm reasonably fine with; there was nothing hugely important in that chapter that couldn't have been put where it ended up and I felt that was an acceptable re-write.  In fact, I quite enjoyed seeing sneaky big brother George (complete with a toothbrush stuck tactlessly in his wound) coming in to embarrass Ginny And Harry.  I felt that scene was one of the most awkward of the film, mostly because I find the ""chemistry"" between Radcliffe and Wright to be pathetically strained, put-on and creepy to watch.  Oliver Phelps (George) saved that scene.

I also appreciated that when everyone regroups at the Burrow after the ""Seven Harrys"" scene, they gave Mr. Weasley's lines in the book (or the equivalent of his lines) to Fred instead.  I felt that was a nice touch, and even as I was reading Deathly Hallows the first time through, the whole time I thought it would have been more touching and appropriate to give Fred more of an interaction with his twin than he had in the book.  It was so moving that even the audience seemed to breathe the same sigh of relief that Fred did.  That's tough to manage in a film so major kudos to the sorely underused and underappreciated Phelps brothers.  I had high standards for the portrayal of Fred and George from the beginning due to the fact that they easily number among my favorite characters of the whole series, and I'm very pleased that James and Oliver deliver so well every time we see them.

CONS:

The only scene that was cut that I truly actually missed, was the scene when Kreacher tells the trio the heartbreaking truth about Sirius's brother Regulus; a truth that not even Sirius or the rest of his family knew.  Although it probably would have taken up a full 5 minutes in the film - a hugely long time for a theatrical scene - in order to convey the message accurately and do the story justice, I still missed it since it was inspiring to learn about Regulus' bravery and sacrifice.  That scene also marked the beginning to Kreacher's newfound loyalty to Harry, which comes into play later on.  I hope we'll see at least some mention of in Part 2, even though the fact that the basis for it was cut from Part 1 may make the connection in Part 2 seem a little random so those who haven't read the books.

Another thing I didn't like, but don't blame ""Part 1"" for, is the immense amount of damage control it had to do after the shoddy, rushed offering that was ""Half-Blood Prince"".  It seemed like all the loose ends that were introduced in HBP and were important to the overall story but we cut out of HBP were all stuffed into the ""Seven Harrys"" sequence.  It was like as each character comes into the room, they have to stop and explain themselves to Harry (or rather, the viewing audience) since Yates failed to include those many major points in HBP.  It's too bad the ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" has to take the heat for that shortcoming.

My one major criticism would be the soundtrack.  With the exception of the song ""Obliviate"" at the beginning, I found the music to be unremarkable and that it added next to nothing to the movie.  As a former music student and performer for many years, I tend to listen very hard for a movie's soundtrack (harder than many of my friends and family members do) and look for a good connection between the movie and music, since music has the power to convey so much that actors or good lighting simply can't.  I just didn't find that in Part 1.  A good score can be easily used to express a message or feeling in a scene, but I can't remember a point in the movie when I felt moved by anything on the soundtrack.  I wish they'd stuck with John Williams or another proven veteran, rather than change things up, though I understand scheduling conflicts probably came into play.  The dreariest, saddest music can also easily be the most beautiful and stirring, but this soundtrack really disappointed me.  Had the movie not been so good as to prevent me from really caring about how bland the music was, I might have rated it lower.

-----------

As for the criticisms I've been seeing from others, one of the most common ones is that it's ""only half a movie"".  In order to preserve the integrity of the conclusion to the biggest selling book series of all time, it was split into two parts to allow for more time to address as much of the canon story as possible without rushing or cutting out too much detail that's so critical to the plot.  Some also complained it dragged.  This isn't a fair criticism for the movie since the camping scenes dominate the novel too, so to those who don't like it, take it up with Rowling, because the movie sticks to her book very well.  Actually, there's more camping in the book than there is in the movie, if I remember correctly.  Still, I didn't mind the camping scenes, since it illustrated the fact that Harry and Hermione (and Ron) really struggled with their goal while also having to be on the run for a majority of the story.

Another popular critical judgment is the debated reason for the split in the first place.  Was Part 1 merely a ""lead-in"" to Part 2?  Just a ""filler"" or ""built-up tease"", as I've seen some critics and fans write?  To each his/her own, I suppose.  My opinion on it is no, it's not filler, and certainly not a way to squeeze more money out of the franchise, as a popular and shrewd argument that's been getting repeated quite a bit says.  However, if it were true, and money were the only driving force here - which I don't agree that it is - then please keep in mind that WB, whose purpose it is as a business is to bring in as much profit as possible, then really, what's the complaint here?  A corporation in a capitalistic society trying to cash in on something people like?  Perfectly understandable.

But like I said above, I do not agree that the choice to split it was based on money-grubbing.  That decision was about maintaining the integrity of the story and I think a lot of people who've read the book can agree that this would have been a total let-down had the powers-that-be allowed all of Deathly Hallows to be stuffed into a single movie.  It's easy for those who are unfamiliar with the books to criticize that decision now simply because they don't know what's all to come from this point on, while the readers know that there's still A LOT of story in ""Deathly Hallows"" left to cover.  I'll be very interested to see if that attitude changes after Part 2 is released.  When they see just how much story is crammed into the final installment (certainly in the book and hopefully in the movie, assuming it does a good job of staying true), I think many of them will be forced to rethink that original opinion.  I think the 2-part split was for the best.

Overall, I was impressed and very satisfied with how Part 1 was translated on-screen.  I, like many others, are stoked for Part 2 and can't wait to see how the movie brings to life the conclusion of the best-selling book series of all time.  I'm just annoyed there's an 8-month wait between Part 1 and 2.  Is it July 15th yet?!",1296864000,2,11235,4.517548195748888
3818015,5,B001UV4XI8,"Deathly Hallows more than blew me way...Rupert Grint and Emma Watson completely stole the show-their chemistry with each other as the bickering, falling completely in love with each other Ron and Hermione was funny, sweet, and at one time sad to watch (because you see how much Ron and Hermione love each other but are afraid to show it yet). Their performances really blew me away-watch Emma's performance when Ron gets splinched or her torture scene; watch Rupert's performance when he is all jealous of Harry and Hermione or his ""speech"". But the best is when Ron returns and Hermione is not exactly ""welcoming back with open arms"" ;) Their relationship was just fun to watch throughout the entire film and will be even more incredible to watch in part 2 as their relationship evolves further :) As for Dan Radcliffe-his highlighted moment was def 7 Potters!!! He was AMAZING there. Dan also does a great job of showing the emotional rollercoaster he is feeling about putting his best friends' lives in danger. As for the movie itself-the scenery was breathtaking, the writing incredible (*very true to the book), the acting superb-the trio, the older adult actors. I saw DH 8 times and would pay to see it another 8 times. I even have friends who don't see movies over again and they have even seen it more than once now! Buy DH!! Wont be disappointed.

However, I was pleasantly surprised when the credits started rolling. I went back to see it three more times! The first half of the book was good but a tad slow, and the filmmakers made sure this wasn't the case for the movie. They created a proper balance of comedy, action, and character development.

3818018,3,B001UV4XI8,"Many people deserve second chances, I guess movies are the same. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and fell asleep whilst watching it. Reading the book I really didn't build my hopes up, having already done that with 'Watchmen' which was disappointing. However this is a new year, and just recently seeing all six parts of the movies, I feel compelled to review this movie. It is a journey movie, and the locales of the movie are extraordinary. The actors are getting better in their performance, and throwing in Bill Nighy made the movie just a bit better. Voldemort in my opinion is not terrific cinematic villain (He's no Darth Vader or Heath Ledger's Joker)he's at best a villain worthy of showtunery. Nevertheless I found this movie to be quite a treat. Note to others I was sleeping off and on. I am eagerly anticipating Deathly Hallows pt. 2.",1295913600,,858,4.688741721854305
3818019,3,B001UV4XI8,"Perhaps this stems from the fact that ""Deathly Hallows"" was kind of a bummer climax to a great book series, one that failed to meet my expectations as a fan, and failed to rank as 5-star reading, coming from an author that had astounded me in the past with her exceptionalism in the quality of her literary output. The novel was slow-moving, often dragging itself to a complete halt before starting itself up again on a lame footing, and then tumbling to an unexciting and open-ended finale.

Not that I dislike the movie so much. It is merely that the film suffers solely from the problems of the book: an over-stretched and ridiculous plot (or lack thereof); a slow moving narrative, which took up over 700 pages when it easily could have used up only 300; and a ruthless extermination of nearly half the population of the Wizarding World in a single brutal sweep by Rowling herself. That being said, if you can disregard the seriously lacking storyline and nonexistent plot, ""Hallows, Part 1"" comes off as a fairly good film.

I have really come to appreciate why the production team chose to split it into two halves. While the tone of the next film is ostensibly going to be full of more fast-paced, action-packed thrills with lots of heroics and explosions, this first part is slower moving, with a kind of stationary adventure taking place outside of Hogwarts, a first for the books and the films. It is easily the darkest of all the films, with bleak, somber scenery, and as dark a tale to match. The characters are more fully explored, particularly the three young heroes, and their depth adds another, more mature element to the story.

Be prepared to shed a few tears, and to cover your eyes and your ears during some of the more horrific moments. I was especially creeped out by the scenes at Bathilda Bagshot's house, and the sequence of Bellatrix torturing Hermione at Malfoy Manor. The gristle and gore is quickly apparent, with frightening scenes of blood and death almost from the get-go (all courtesy of J.K. Rowling's book, I might add).  But considering the film was created by a team made up mostly of men and born from Rowling's imagination, I am thankful it wasn't any worse. While the same bad stuff happens, its been toned down to suit a PG-13 rating, and the gruesome shots never last more than a few seconds.

You do have to give yourself time to get used to being out of your element--like the book, you never get to see Hogwarts castle. Being a ""road"" picture, most of the story takes place during what seems like an extended camping trip. The main focus is the three kids and their quest to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, though what they do accomplish in the stretch of two and a half hours is precious little. While an improvement from the book, I was surprised afterward how much time it took for so little to happen, even though it seemed like things were in constant motion. The action is spread over numerous campsites across the country, with bits of action, character development, and plot exposition thrown in. Not the most inspiring setting, but it works better in a movie than I thought it would.

Regarding the script, Steven Kloves remained exceedingly faithful to J.K. Rowling's story, with the Deathly Hallows still taking front seat,  and everything else following, for better or worse. He is also equally as ruthless, sparing no one and leaving every death (all 6) in place that she put into what makes up the first installment. Even so, there are several changes which made for a great improvement to the plot. For instance, things move quicker leading up to the recovery of the first Horcrux. The pacing is shored up and sheared considerably from the book, where as I said before it dragged and dragged until it came to a complete halt. The film never stops moving, and often leaves you completely breathless. It is easily ten times more exciting than how it was written. To put it one way, I knew everything that was going to happen, yet I sat on the edge of my seat biting my nails the entire time. Little time is spent at either the Dursley's or the Burrow; Harry's birthday is completely skipped over; and Bill and Fleur's wedding is also condensed considerably. The time within Grimmauld place is robbed of screen-time but loaded with tension; the few moments inside are as nerve-wracking as any taking place in the forest outside.

The strained relationship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione felt monotonous and after a while unbelievable in the book, but because the acting of the three stars is so strong, it works in the movie. Amongst the discord, there is a sense of unity between the three friends. Harry doesn't argue so much with the other two and is less belligerent. The fights between he and Ron have been paired down to one, and he seems to be more understanding of Hermione's feelings in particular, making their special bond even more poignant. I really enjoyed several moments where he finally stands up and acts like a man, particularly the sequence where he comforts a downtrodden Hermione by dancing with her, a nice addition by Kloves that wasn't in the original book.

You can really see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint coming into their own as actors. Watson is perhaps the best out of the three, carrying so many emotions at one time it's hard to keep up. Grint does an equally commendable job with Ron's conflicting emotions and his wavering faith in Harry, and often provides some well-timed comic relief. Radcliffe seems to be more comfortable in his role than the previous films, and as a consequence, Harry seems to have matured considerably, growing as a person and developing another layer of depth and complexity that adds even more interest to his character. For instance, after the face-off with Nagini at Godric's Hollow, Hermione shows Harry the bits of his broken wand. Instead of blowing up at her and acting like an ungrateful prig as he does in the book, he acts far more accepting, actually thanking her for saving their lives instead of bawling her out.

Even though many, many technical advancement have been made since the earlier movies, I found the special effects for this one a bit too cartoonish. Dobby and Kreacher's faces looked far too human to be house-elves, and not quite as magical as in films 2 and 5. The shadow-puppet-like animation for tale of the Three Brothers was very odd, and I felt it detracted from the story too much.

Of all of the alterations made to the plot, my one complaint was that Kloves chose not to spare Dobby, the poor, good-natured house-elf who gets mercilessly killed at Belltrix's hands, an unnecessary moment from the book that really galled me. In the film, it was painful to watch Harry call out to Hermione to help him, and watch as she does nothing. Rowling frequently contradicts herself, and this was one of the worst.  How is it Hermione could stop Ron from bleeding to death after he was splinched, or save Harry from a near-fatal snake bite, yet she can't help a house-elf that was wounded with an ordinary dagger? It would have been such an easy change--I really wish the film had ended better.

As a movie, I can't complain. It had good acting, good cinematography, fairly good music, good visual effects, and a great production crew. It was a marked improvement from the book itself, and while maybe not as marked as I would have liked, it is nonetheless something I would consider re-viewing. If it lacks, it is in no way the fault of the filmmakers. They did the best they could with the material given to them. Let's just hope the next time around (Part 2), will improve upon the source instead of slavishly adhering to it.",1295136000,5,7691,4.696587537091988
3818020,4,B001UV4XI8,"As the aggregation of six films, the first part of the final Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (whew), carries with it weighty expectations.  With each installment the stakes have been raised to the point where the final film will have awfully high hurdles to clear.  Besides, after making one's way through what's likely around fifteen hours of film already, you're likely going to want a massive payoff.  In the case of HP 7.5, it may be too early to decide whether the concluding movie delivers on the ever growing anticipation for the final conflict between good and evil, but I can confidently state that the film ingeniously ups the ante not by making Potter and his gang face off against even more powerful magicians, but by making our heroes grapple with their own interior fears, jealousies and existential nightmares.

Just as the final film in the series has been cleaved in two, we might look at HP 7.5 as a film divided.  The first half takes the form of an espionage thriller, pitting Voldermort against the Order of the Phoenix.  Realizing that Harry might be the only person capable of defeating Voldemort, the Order of the Phoenix creates several Harry decoys in hopes of redirecting any assassination attempts away from the real Harry.  Their ruse is almost immediately discovered when several Death Eaters intercept the faux-Harries (and the real one) in mid-air, leading to an impressive chase scene across the London skyline and English countryside.  This action sequence is perhaps only bested by Harry, Ron and Hermione's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, which has been recently co-opted by the Death Eaters, to retrieve a magic locket.  These set pieces give the audience exactly what they want from their blockbusters: big adventure and even bigger special effects.  Unlike the average blockbuster, which usually globs a bunch of CGI on the screen like a two year old with finger paints, HP 7.5's action is carefully crafted mixture of excruciating suspense and daring deeds.

About halfway through the film, however, HP 7.5 makes a strange turn into what seems like a different film.  After recovering the magic locket from the Ministry of Magic, Harry and company flee to the English countryside in order to decide how to dispose of this mystical object.  The locket, we learned from the last installment, is a horcrux, or an object that houses part of Voldemort's soul and grants him eternal life, until they're all destroyed, that is.  The horcrux locket shares many of the same qualities as the ring in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings saga.  It cannot be destroyed by except under special circumstances and brings out the worst in whoever happens to bear the locket at any given time.  Naturally, the three take turns with the evil artifact, but this precaution still does not prevent the inanimate agitator from wreaking havoc on their interpersonal relationships.  Ron is the first affected by the heavy burden of the locket, accusing Harry and Hermione of carrying on an illicit affair and eventually abandoning their expedition.

Of course, Ron isn't entirely wrong in his accusations.  It is difficult not to notice a simmering mutual attraction between Harry and Hermione.  After Ron leaves, the two of them share a dance to a Nick Cave song (a lesser director would have brought in the overused ""Hallelujah,"" and still an even lesser director would have used the Rufus Wainright cover), a surprisingly tender moment that is at first difficult to read.  By establishing that Ron's insecurities are more than just paranoia, the film utilizes the locket's magic to uncover real depth to its characters.  The majority of the second half follows the characters as they attempt to discover how to destroy the horcrux, all the while moving from one gorgeous British landscape to the next.  This extended camping trip seems somewhat lugubrious compared to the tightly constructed first half, and, as they stumble from one clue to the next Harry and Hermione seem at a loss as to what direction to take and where to go.  This is their ""Jesus in the Wilderness"" moment where the characters begin to question the efficacy of what they are doing.  We might also situate this stretch of the film within the innocence to experience themes that Rowlings has been working with since the first book.

If we view the Harry Potter saga as a story about a boy growing up and learning more about himself and the world as he progresses through an educational system, then, like anyone who has graduated from high school or college, we must contend with the question of what this individual will do once he is freed from the helpful constraints of schooling, where the next step forward is always placed right in front of you.  Every schoolchild dreams of the freedom of adulthood, but few actually know what to do with themselves immediately after escaping the bonds of education (tellingly, Hogwarts is absent this time around).  Everyone has his or her moment in the wilderness.  This reading of HP 7.5 is bolstered by the strange, esoteric logic of the quest.  The way that Harry and Hermione stumble from one clue to the next signifies the sometimes directionless nature of adulthood.

What's particularly ingenious about HP 7.5 is that it overlays adult existentialist questions over what is ostensibly a ""children's film.""  It is not, however, the first kid's film of 2010 to do this.  Toy Story 3 similarly grappled with questions of life's purpose and death's eventuality.  What makes these films ""dark"" has nothing to do with violence or obscenities (although the trash dump in Toy Story 3 was rather frightening), but rather with their ability to imbue films made for a broad audience with themes that most of us would rather not think about on our day out with the relatives.  There are other family films that are more violent and contain more sexual innuendoes, but these elements just as often make the films more juvenile as they make them more adult (filmmakers and fanboys take note).  HP 7.5 and TS 3 show us that big movies are capable of tackling big questions.

HP 7.5 strides into theaters with the confidence only millions of ready made fans can muster.  It decides, with great effect, to slow the plot down just when most films would be hustling to throw everything they have at the audience.  It also includes a gorgeous animated sequence that incorporates fairy tales into the repertoire of Rowling's collage of influences.  If there is one thing that holds the film back, it is its role as prelude to the big finale.  It is difficult for a film without an ending to fully satisfy, especially when we know that part two is just a few months away.  Of course, when the credits roll on the final Harry Potter film, I reserve the right to adjust my score accordingly.",1294531200,2,6837,4.87381158167675

I have read all the books, some several times, I have seen all the movies up to this point and I will own all the DVDs sold.  All the actors in this series are wonderful.  They will always remain favorites of mine. However, I cannot give this movie the five stars it could have been.  The movie ran 2 hours and 26 minutes; Longer than some movies but shorter than other epics such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  And for an extra 15 minutes the movie could have stayed more true to the books.  I would have sat there for another hour had it followed the book better.  By taking short cuts, they lost some of the charm that JK Rowling created. Why didn't someone cry foul when this was being filmed?  Or did this happen during editing?

3818023,4,B001UV4XI8,"Sad days lay ahead now that the ""Harry Potter"" saga is coming to an end.

There isn't anything else like it now (""Twilight""? Please!) and it seems doubtful anything else will be able to match it for some time to come. Author JK Rowling created a series of highly imaginative books introducing us to a bevy of unusual, interesting characters we have lived with for a long time, so long they seem like friends/ When the enormous success of the first few books led to the inevitable films, many die-hard fans were worried. Thankfully, the first two films were adequate, if uninspired. Beginning with the third film, the series takes on a darker personality, to match the tone of the books, and allowed a handful of more creative directors to create a movie series worthy of the imagination the books helped us conjure.

Warner Bros. made the right decision to tell the story of the ""Deathly Hallows"" in two films. This frees Steve Kloves, the screenwriter of the entire series, and David Yates, the director of the last four films in the series, to tell as much of the story as humanly possible. Given ""Part 1"" runs close to 3 hours, they are covering a lot of the book. This is a refreshing change of pace as each of the previous film adaptations pared down the material, sacrificing characters, subplots, relationships.

And much like the book, ""Part 1"" basically sets up ""Part 2"". It is basically an introduction to the conclusion, the set-up for the big finale, the epic battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Some may feel there is too much exposition. I don't. It works and the filmmaking is top notch creating a thrilling chapter in the series.

Picking up at what would be the beginning of Potter's final year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) wait anxiously for their friends in the Order of the Phoenix. Soon everyone assembles at Harry's Muggle home and an elaborate plan is put in place to move Harry to a secure location and keep him out of the hands of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But Voldemort and his minions are hot on their path. Harry, Hermione and Ron quickly decide to flee to a secret place in the forest and hide out. They spend every moment trying to figure out how to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. Once these powerful mementos of Tom Riddle's life are gone, they believe He Who Must Not Be Named will be vulnerable and they stand a chance to defeat the enemy. But Voldemort is looking for some very different items, the Deathly Hallows, items he believes will help him defeat that pesky Potter.

Yates and Kloves have done a remarkable job of building the story towards this inevitable dark climax. As the stakes rise, the danger increases matching the dark tone of the narrative. Given this series was originally written with pre-teens in mind, it is nice to see the filmmakers have not shied away from depicting these dark moments.

Throughout the series, the three leads have grown both physically and as actors. Daniel Radcliffe creates a viable persona for Harry, giving him a human quality, real feelings, making us care and root for him. When his friends face danger on his behalf, we can see the pain on his face as he realizes the sacrifices others are making for him. Emma Watson continues to give Hermione a real depth. She has always been the smart one, the one who excels in her studies, and the one her friends turn to for a quick spell or an answer to a puzzle. But as she has grown into a young lady, threads of confusion have woven into her performance; she doesn't understand the power she holds over boys, but is only too willing to use this power when necessary. Rupert Grint has grown most of all. In the early days, his google eyes and incessant mugging made it almost impossible to watch him. Now, he is able to channel the real feelings and distractions any teenager might feel which make him seem more real and more interesting.

The most disappointing thing about ""Part 1"" is something dictated by the book, so I am not sure the film should be faulted. The best thing about this series is the rich wealth of acting talent appearing in supporting roles as various wizards, witches and villains. Alan Rickman, the best throughout, plays the sly, sneaky and snarky Professor Severus Snape. It is great fun to watch him play the role, tailor-made for his talents, with such relish. Maggie Smith is very good as Professor McGonagall, the head of Harry's house and a defacto mother for the young wizard. Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Harris, Imelda Staunton, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths and Michael Gambon, to name a very few, have all taken on roles and all have been memorable.

Ralph Fiennes returns as Lord Voldemort, the ultimate bad guy. He Who Must Not Be Named is ready to battle the young wizard, his nemesis for all of these years. He is ready to take over the wizarding world, his power is growing, and he now has control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Muggles should be very afraid.

But in ""Part 1"", a significant portion of the film involves the three young friends hiding out in the forest, trying to figure things out. This involves a lot of talking and some arguing. Most of all, these moments keep us away from most of the British actors who lend their talents to and provide some of the most memorable moments in the series. While Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all grown as actors, it is still far more interesting to watch them interact with a virtual who's-who of British cinema. Thankfully, many of these actors should play a more pivotal role in ""Part 2"".

The ""Harry Potter"" franchise has been and will continue to be so lucrative for all involved it makes sense Warner Bros. has always been extremely careful with each film, creating one great film after another. ""Part 1"" is no exception and I think it may be one of the most beautiful in the series. From the moment we enter the wizarding world, everything looks real, beautiful and wonderful. The ability to make this world appear so real, as it basically sits on top of London, is no small feat. The film opens with an exciting chase, our attention focused on Harry as he rides in Hagrid's sidecar. The motorcycle roars through London traffic and at one point drives upside down in a tunnel. The motorcycle speeds through traffic and helps illustrate the danger our hero faces as he straddles these two worlds. The previously mentioned scenes of the trio in the forest and other natural locales are also beautiful, reflecting the harsh reality of a British winter. When the action moves to the Ministry of Magic, you feel as though your are entering the halls of a hallowed institution.

I also enjoyed the Tale of the Deathly Hallows. Late in the film, Hermione finally has a moment to recount the story for Harry's benefit. As she narrates the fable, it is illustrated for us using a series of dark shadows, as though puppets are recreating the tale. This technique helps to give the story a children's book quality; the characters might be hand shadows or paper cutouts moving across a sepia background. It is a nice touch to further reinforce the fable nature of the story, a fable both Hermione and Ron heard as children. It almost feels as though we are watching the story unfold through Potter's eyes.

The ""Harry Potter"" films are magical and as the series comes to a close, everyone has such high expectation for the last two films. If these expectations aren't met, they will feel disappointed. Originally, ""Part 1"" was going to be released in 3-D, which was exciting news; using this technique promised to bring the world in these films to life. But then Warner Bros. changed their plans and I learned these films weren't actually made in 3-D. They were going to retrofit the second to last film, the same technique used to help make ""Clash of the Titans"" the piece of crap it is. Thank goodness they changed their mind. ""Clash"" looks terrible, as though the film was made in the 50s using the original 3-D technology. The newest ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is also retrofitted and looks it. I have to wonder why they continue to do this and also why didn't they just make the film in 3-D to begin with? It boggles my mind to think they might have subjected ""Part 1"" to this process, creating a sub par entry in the series. As the second to last entry in the series, an awful experience would be a huge let down to the loyal fans and would leave a bad taste in their mouth.

Hopefully, this common sense will prevail for ""Part 2"" as well.

""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is a necessary step to ""Part 2"". It isn't the most memorable entry in the series, but it is very good. And my expectations for ""Part 2"" are very high.",1293667200,2,8901,4.65034965034965
3818024,1,B001UV4XI8,"After watching this movie a second time, It just went from bad to worse. It just kills me that Yates and Co. were brought back for the rest of the series.

 The director seems to think that a ""dark story"" means insufficient lighting in a film. This movie seems to be lit by candle light. You can't see the actors or the magnificent sets at all. The writing and direction is lackluster at best.

 I get it that things must be left out in order to make a book into a movie, story lines must be changed somewhat in order to do this, but there is no excuse for adding things that weren't in the book, while dropping important parts that were.  It is like the best parts of the book were changed or left out entirely, and all of the slower parts of the book were extended as far as they could go, and then extended some more.

 There are parts in the book could have been explored in more detail, which would have made this movie truer to form, and much more exciting. They have however, taken the vision and the promise of an extremely good book, cut out all of the pages, wrote a few chapters of their own, and sewn everything back in some haphazard manner. It is completely lacking in the qualities that made the book so good. The awful screenwriting seems to have taken it's toll even on the most talented actors, and the entirety of the film comes out as one drab mess. Director David Yates and his team seem to think that they can write the story better than J. K. Rowling...

 They should have hired someone out of high school to direct and write the screenplay, or better yet, stuck with Alfonso Cuaron (Prisoner Of Azkaban) and his team. OMG if this wasn't a Harry Potter film, no one would have gone to see it. It has become a sad ending to a wonderful story. Seriously.",1293667200,7,1775,4.2746268656716415
3818025,3,B001UV4XI8,"I really enjoyed not only the stories in the Harry Potter series but also the great talent and forethought that went into creating them.  Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.

The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were ""required"" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the dnouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!

The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2  hour film.

The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them ""camping out"" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.

Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part.",1293408000,5,3129,4.76252319109462
3818026,4,B001UV4XI8,"I wouldn't dream of not seeing this as Harry Potter, whether in print, audio or film, has been a most wonderful experience for me.  However, I did wonder after seeing this movie, whether it had been a mistake to divide the last book into two parts. This is because the pace is slower than either the novel or the other six movies.  No one ever divided the other movies into two parts, however.  This made the other movies not waste a second whereas in this one the pace is a bit more leisurely.

That being said, this otherwise brings the novel faithfully to life.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are on the run as they hunt for the horcruxes to destroy Lord Voldemort.  There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.

Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.

If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.  As it is, one is left a bit unsatisfied at the odd truncation point of this seventh film, a part one rather than a whole film.

3818027,5,B001UV4XI8,"For the Harry Potter fandom the wait for a new movie has been quite rewarding. Deathly Hallows Part I, has very successfully built up the suspense and the curiosity of the myriad of Potter fans, who will now wait restlessly for the final climax of the series. Followers of Harry Potter and his two friends, who have grown up simultaneously with the fictional trio, would have found the confusions, frustrations and rage of the stormy teenage years very familiar. The plot deals with a lot of real emotions, the emotions and aches of growing up, of being challenged. There is jealousy, anger and empathy--these human emotions mark a departure of Deathly from the bravado and mindless adventures of the earlier Potter flicks.

Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the numerous attacks of the Death Eaters, let loose by Voldemort. The killing mission includes a high adrenalin chase of Harry and his seven look-alikes by the blood thirsty gang, which is a high point of the movie, visually. Potter and friends escape into the wilderness, but the Death Eaters' attacks never come to an end, and their goons capture and take them to the lair.

The trio escapes from the dungeon with the help of elf Dobby who pays with his life in the effort to release them. Dobby's death in the lap of Harry Potter brings about the most poignant scene in the movie. Now Harry and friends come to learn about the Deathly Hallows, based on some symbols and their intuitions. Hermione's reading of the story about the seven deathly hallows is accompanied by a symbolic enactment, which is very captivating and will remain deeply etched in the viewer's mind for long.

While the development of the plot is very intelligent and flawless, there are certain issues about the pace of the movie. Some parts drag, especially the lengthy discussions and deliberations. The many ifs and buts during the unfolding of the plot frustrate the viewer, used to the fast pace of the childhood adventure and games of the earlier movies. Most of the action takes place in the outside world, away from the all too familiar school premises. That's a welcome change.

Finally the fights and misunderstandings between Harry and Ron depict the coming of age of the chums.

The die-hard fans will surely revel in the movie despite the fact the director David Yates has taken a lot of liberty about his selection of which part of the book to include in the movie and which to leave out.  For the uninitiated, though, this random and non-linear selection may appear quite disjointed and confusing.

  The film isn't just dark with barely any charm or laughs like the last film. There's plenty of magic, excitement and heart-felt moments that will keep you entertained through-out. This Potter is easily one of the years best and one of the best Potters!",1292371200,,457,4.62962962962963
3818029,4,B001UV4XI8,"While I thought the production team did a great job with the film, I think it's a perfect example of ""if you haven't read the book, it won't make much sense.""  At this point, why would anyone see a Potter film without having read the books?  It boggles the mind.  That said, this review is written toward those who know the story, proper.

The direction was good, as was most of the writing.  Rupurt Grint was ever on pointe as Ron, and Radcliffe has without question grown his skills as Boy Who.  Watson finally acted, and without total reliance on eyebrows!  She was actually impressive in this film.  Maybe she has an acting career ahead, yet. The adult cast stepped it up in this installment, as well.  Billowy-cloaked Snape is a thing to behold, as is a broken Lucius Malfoy.  I was happy to see Carter act as if she wanted to be there, which finally brought Bellatrix alive for me.  Newcomer Rhys Ifans was wonderful.  In short, every actor delivered a standout performance.  Very impressive, in that regard.  The creatively layered reunion of the entire cast was fantastic.  That excitement alone boosts anticipation of the next film.

I appreciate that this film was split, in order to do the story justice, as well it should have been.  I can't help but think that all of the action and luster is in the second half, which leaves this lead-up a bit diminished.  In the story proper, this portion should be the emotional setup for what is to come, and in that regard I felt it lacked.  The darkness, thus direness, of the Wizarding world was made evident from the opening scene.  This is no children's film.  Know that the racy scenes and violence reveal this throughout.  Still, even with poignant smatterings of grief and terror, the emotional depth did not sustain.  I would have gladly sat through a four-hour film if longevity would have maintained the momentum better.

SPOILERS
I was a bit bereft of the treatment of Hedwig's demise.  As the film left it, her absence was the only real indicator that she was dead.  The lack of Harry's processing of that was equally unrealistic and unclear. More acknowledgement was given to the loss of Dobby, who had far less face time in the films than she did.  Though Hagrid was Harry's first real friend in the Wizarding world, Hedwig was his first real emotional connection in his life.  I didn't think it canon that this bond wouldn't have been more acknowledged at her death.

Though the camping scenes didn't make for riveting action (the same can be said of the book), the character development during those weeks was long overdue.  We saw a darkness in Ron prior unrevealed, a depth to Hermione and Harry's relationship had only been hinted at prior, and a long-needed resourcefulness in Harry was finally tapped.  I agree with criticism that pace slowed tremendously during those scenes, but what we learned about the trio in that stillness was necessary.  In truth, it was better delivered in the film than in the book, albeit out of sequence in the film.

Insight into what was happening at Hogwart's bore showing.  Early in the film, the impression is finally given that this is not just Harry's fight, but is that of the entire Wizarding world.  But by focusing primarily on the trio's lives and not how others contributed to the effort--and they were--much of that communal sense of obligation, thus sacrifice, is lost.

Explanations of the Hallows was rushed at best.  If you didn't understand them or how they and their lineage relate to Harry's plight, I'm afraid rewinding won't be much help.  That said, if you know their far-reaching relevance from the book, the animated sequence telling their story was well-done, albeit quickly so.

The cheesiest effect in the film was Ron's greatest fears come to life, seeing Harry and Hermione passionately locked together.  It looked like a 2D paste job against a rolling CGI effect.  I was so unamused by the effect that I didn't connect with what a riveting and psychological test it was for Ron.

The best scene in the film was Harry silently summoning Hermione to dance.  Without being romantic or sentimental it was profound, showing how Harry has matured into awareness of and reaction to the emotional states of others.  This is the trait that sets Harry apart from Voldemort more than any other, and this scene subtly conveyed his finesse in interpersonal observation and reaction.

Several vaguely explained plot items troubled me, most of which were also problematic in the previous films.  Dobby showing up with no explanation is a major oversight that did not need to be.  The Missing Mirror, which should have been introduced way back at The Order of the Phoenix and wasn't now shows up with no explanation at all.  This lack negates how instrumental it is in the escape from Malfoy Manner, and diminishes the grief that Harry still processes from Sirius', and most recently Dumbledore's death.  Along that line, the need for the horcruxes is revealed, though the significance of the items precious to each of the Houses at Hogwart's is not.

The ultimate judgment of this final installment must await the release of Part II next year, but this is a promising start.  In a series with such a large cast and such a convoluted storyline, it is good to see a renewed emphasis on character.  This is the brilliance in spreading this final episode out over two films (apart from the extra dollars to be made).  Many of the other films have felt rushed, and the scenes in which our heroes camp out in isolation would surely have been greatly curtailed if not cut altogether without the breathing room this approach provides.

3818035,4,B001UV4XI8,"I've read all the books, seen all the movies (to date) and this one was good but definitely not the best of them.  I do have to confess that its been awhile since I read the book, but I was scratching my head through part of this movie trying to figure out where some of the scenes came from.  Whether this is from faulty memory or drastic changes from the book, I'm not quite sure.

For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, they should be read/watched in sequence without skipping around.  To do otherwise is to miss out on a lot of important plot details.  Its also important to note that the books have vastly more detail and help explain some things the movies do not so I recommend reading the books to help fill some of these holes in the movies.

Harry Potter had lived with his aunt and uncle and their spoiled son when one day he discovers he is a wizard and can attend the magical school of Hogwarts.  Harry has a sad past though, his parents were killed by an evil wizard and throughout the books, that wizard keeps trying to come back and kill Harry.  This wizard, Voldemort, has finally regained power and taken over the world.  Harry, and his two friends Hermione and Ron set out to find the last of the Horcruxes, talismen that hold a part of Voldemort's soul and are the key to killing him once and for all.  Their journey is not easy, and they are pursued at every step, betrayed, and even injured.  In addition to this, they have to cope with their feelings for each other and maintain their friendship.

Since it only covers half of the book, this movie largely focuses on Harry and the gang trying to find some of the horcruxes without going into any real battle.  There are a couple squirmishes so fighting is not totally ruled out in this movie.  The fighting can be brutal and may scare some younger viewers.  Some of the characters are just plain creepy as well.  Bellatrix especially, she gives me shivers.

Ron really took a shining role in this movie.  He was witty and showed a wide range of emotion.  Hermione of course was her perfect self, but even she was allowed to fly off the handle a bit.  Harry was stoic and set upon his task, but I do think they could have given him a few more bits of happiness in the movie than they did.  Comic relief was far and few between in this dark movie.  Which is not necessarily bad, but could make the movie a bit heavy for some viewers.  The rest of the characters were all played well and very believable.  Its nice that they really tried to find the perfect person for each part and it makes the movie that much more relatable to the books.

My only complaints with the movie are that some of the scenes were longer than necessary.  I realize character development is important, but after awhile, watching them trudge around with their tent got a little boring and I would have liked to see the pace pick up a bit or even some of those scenes cut.  Yes, the book may have had that as well, but movie going is a very different animal than book reading, and some things should be changed to reflect that.  In addition, I was also a bit disappointed they cut out the devlopment of Kreacher in the movie when he played such a huge role in the book.  It seems to me they could have had more of that and less of tent trudging.

For the more technical aspects of the movie, the special effects and cinematography were great.  Even better than the previous movies in my opinion. I especially loved the tree outside the Lovegood's home. The music is always wonderful and really fit with the tone of the movie.

It was a wonderful movie though and mostly faithful to the book.  I would take a guess that any fan of Harry Potter will probably enjoy this movie.  Now I just have to wait for the much anticipated finale.

3818036,5,B001UV4XI8,"The 7th movie in this series is the best so far and the best adaptation from the book to the movies by a landslide.

I found that the book moved extremely slow and had the characters parked in certain locations for months. I thought that this diminished the dangers they faced, the enlongated time in the book took away the tension. Also I thought with so much time gone by, couldn't they have come up with a better plan. Couldn't the Order of the Pheonix be doing the job that these three kids are doing? What are they doing during this time? The other good wizards seem to sit and wait to be picked off. It made no sense.

The movie condensed the book timeframe and translated what took months in the book to seem like days in the film. I think this definately turned up the tension. In the film I felt these kids were constantly in danger and thus didn't have the time to formulate a clear plan. It made the risky decisions they made more plausable to me. It also made the absence of communication or action by the ""good"" wizards of the order of the Pheonix more understandable. I understand that the people who read the books want every detail in the films, but a lot of what was cut would make a very rocky translation to film (it just wouldn't work).

After the first two movies of this series I really felt the screenwriter really got in a groove of how to translate this series. With the sheer number of characters, creatures, objects, and locations in this series they really did a great job of streamlining it and giving all these elements meaningful screentime. The Harry Potter film series is really amazing in how they were able to fill the roles with quality actors and retain those actors for a decade (the only exception was the original actor who played Dumbledore died after the second film). How lucky were they that they cast three children that grew into very capable actors and didn't have the ""Disney children melt downs"" that so many instantly famous children seem to do. Warner Brothers really did the Harry Potter film series right, a rarity in Hollywood really. Look what Lucas did to the Star War movies, yikes! Imagine if Steven Spielberg had got his way and combined the first two Harry Potter books into one movie (Thank goodness Spielberg never touched these movies!). All of the filmmakers they hired to direct parts 3 through 8 were perfect matches for the entry they made. Keeping the same screenwriter had a lot to do with the quality of this series (and the fact they kept Rowling involved through the whole adaptation too!) So bravo to Warner Brothers for getting something right!

The fact of the matter is this film sets up the last film, and if part one is any indication I think they are going to knock part 2 out of the park. For all those claiming this movie did not have enough action, just wait. Knowing what's ahead, I think almost the entire second film will be high stakes action and based on what I've seen I bet the last film will be better than the second half of the last book too!",1291075200,2,3034,4.471119133574007
3818037,2,B001UV4XI8,"Boring, plodding, tedious, stretched out to fill two movies. The poster shows action, but should have shown Harry just standing there instead. I hate false advertising!

After the initial escape scene, it's loooooooooooong, lingering shots for most of the movie, interspersed with short bits of action, some of which is so badly filmed so that you can't see what's happening. It's obvious that they're stretching it to justify two movies. They should have just made two 1.5-hour or 2-hour movies instead of subjecting us to these tediously boring stretches.

My friends told me it was that way in the book, but slavishly following the book does not make for good filmmaking.

There's a wedding scene that doesn't make any sense at all. Voldemort and company are scouring the world for Harry, and they throw a big wedding party? Want to attract attention much?

And the super wand is hidden in a place that is all too easy to access ... I don't remember the upcoming plot, but I'll have to assume that Dumbledore *wanted* Voldemort to get his mitts on it, for some reason.

There is a somewhat racy scene I'm not sure I'd want kids seeing - suggestive of Harry and Hermione embracing nude. It seemed unhealthy for all concerned, in a ""kid's"" movie.

Very touching scene with a CGI elf, though.",1291075200,13,1292,4.771300448430493
3818038,2,B001UV4XI8,"I really loved all the Harry Potter's except this one and the first one.  The first one was too childish for my taste.  And this one was too boring.  Over half of the movie they are stranded on the side of a mountain or a hill waiting for Harry to figure out how to destroy a Horcrux. There were times when I wondered if J. K. Rowling has seen broke back mountain a few too many times.  If Ron and Harry had been left on the side of the mountain who knows this might have come true.  The movie was good up until the last hour where all you see is them trapped on the side of the hill.  This may have been okay for the readers of the book but not for someone who is only into the movies.  In the end I think that Warner Brothers is just attempting to milk this story for all its worth with its 2 parts.  It would have probably been okay if it was all there, but then again what do you expect from a greedy company like Warner Brothers.",1290988800,7,934,3.9308510638297873
3818039,5,B001UV4XI8,"Though Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One is a blockbuster about teenage wizards, the seventh in the Harry Potter series is more ambiguous and thematically relevant than many movies about adults. The plot will baffle those who have either not seen the previous film or read J. K. Rowling's bestselling books.

The wicked Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) gathers his band of Death Eaters to create a world where muggles (non-magical humans) are subservient to wizards. Voldemort himself echoes Hitler's makeup in that he is half-muggle, and pamphlets strewn throughout the film (including one titled ""when muggles attack"") resemble Nazi propaganda.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) abandon their final year at the magical school of Hogwarts to embark on a quest to destroy Voldemort. To do this, they must find six horcruxes, objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul.

Deathly Hallows: Part One, the second to last film, is more appropriate for teenagers than young children. From the barren scenery to the shuddering, downcast portrait of Harry on a wanted poster, a sense of despair pervades the atmosphere. As our three young heroes struggle with uncertainty, their friendship is put to the test.

Seasoned British thespians including Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham Carter have little more than cameos, but most minor characters are well handled. Memorable roles include Alan Rickman's icy Snape, David Thewlis's kind werewolf Lupin (in human form), and Imelda Staunton's creepy interrogator Dolores Umbridge.

Voldemort's hosts, Death Eaters Draco (Tom Felton) and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), exemplify the crumbling upper class. Humiliated by Voldemort and lower-class thugs, the snobbish Malfoys discover how overturning the social order can negatively affect them.

The odious but helpful house-elf Kreachure, a CGI creation, is marvelously voiced by Simon McBurney. The more heroic house-elf Dobby (Toby Jones) is less successful. He comes across as more cartoonish than inspiring.

But the heart of this film is the trio. Due to the amount of material crammed into each movie, Hermione and Ron have often felt more like sidekicks than complete characters. Here their acting, especially Ms. Watson's, has improved and their conflicts are fleshed out.

We see Hermione's sacrifice as she erases her muggle family's memories in order to protect them. One of the youngest and least powerful in a large family of strong wizards, Ron and his insecurities also emerge, as does his resentment about the relationship between the famous Harry and overachieving Hermione.

Ron and Hermione's unspoken romance is humorous, frustrating, and sweet. While Hermione notes that she is ""always mad"" at Ron, she and Harry have a more harmonious and platonic connection. Their closeness is demonstrated in the film's most moving scene, when Harry dances with Hermione. Though not in the book, this moment of joy is a counterpoint to the darkness that takes up so much of the film, and the dance dissolves when they recall the complexity of their situation.

The most creative part of the film, arguably of the entire series, is a curious but fascinating animation of The Tale of the Three Brothers. Nicely read by Ms. Watson, the story of Death's encounter with three brothers is grim, eerie, and hauntingly beautiful.

The film is by no means perfect. It has its share of melodrama, and Alexandre Deslpat's usually lovely score can be laughably over-the-top. Long pauses prolong an already lengthy movie. Part One's abrupt ending isn't particularly satisfying; the audience will have to wait until Part Two for a real conclusion.

Still, it is touching to see the tired and worn triumvirate walk past charred trailer homes as they listen to death tolls on the radio. Hardly older than children, they have to learn that heroism is more tedious than glorious. With only one more film to go, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One manages to be the most emotionally resonant Harry Potter movie yet.",1290902400,7,4077,5.26502311248074
3818040,5,B001UV4XI8,"The movie had a lot of action and very fast. The 2 1/2 hours goes by very quick. They end on a cliff-hanger, but still a good end. Can't wait until the next one.",1290902400,,161,3.764705882352941
3818041,5,B001UV4XI8,"I'm one of those who hasn't yet read this book. So far, I've been able to see the movie and then read the book and that works for me - I don't want any visions of anything in my own head to ruin the movie for me. Reading through some of these reviews, maybe I should have read this book first.

But having said that, I really love this movie. The first time I saw it, to be honest, I was quite bored with all the camping scenes and could have done with some more of the wedding, instead. I didn't realize that Bill was marrying Fleur from the tri-wizard cup until the second time I saw it. And there's a tiny bit of conversation that gives the impression that Bill's now a werewolf himself and learning things from Lupin, who's going to become a father soon, at least that's what seems to be implied. Would have loved more info here!

Also, I had forgotten some things that happened in the 'Half Blood Prince' and watched it closely before seeing the 'Deathly Hallows' the second time. Three of the characters looked the same to me, so that was confusing and I'm not sure why Mr Malfoy was acting so scared and timid around Voldemort when he'd always been so bold around him before. And I'm still holding out for Snape to turn out to be one of the good guys! And did we *really* lose Mad Eye? We didn't see him killed, maybe he's recuperating somewhere while we're all watching Harry and Hermione camping? No idea.

The humor in this film is excellent, I didn't really think there would be much to laugh at in this installment. The scene with all the Harry's was hysterical, then George with the toothbrush stuck in his ear, that guy just has to stand there wearing that goofy expression and it's hilarious. Then comes the polyjuice potion. The guy playing Harry was absolutely perfect with his expressions and body movement, it cracked me up just seeing him turn and walk away.

And the ultimate sign of a great movie is when the entire audience says 'ahhhhhhhhhh!!!' when it's over, everyone wants to see more!",1290816000,2,2012,4.42972972972973
3818042,5,B001UV4XI8,"This is definitely my favorite move so far in the series. Lots of action, drama, and a bit of humor. Part 2 will most likely surpass this one, tho.",1290816000,,147,4.103448275862069
3818043,5,B001UV4XI8,"The final Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is an adaptation of the darkest book in the series. It only makes sense that the film is also going to be the darkest of its series. Harry Potter 7 was felt by the production crew to be so complex, despite not being the longest book in the series, that they reached a decision to split the film into two parts. So far, the first part, despite being out for only 8 days, has grossed about $400M. Now, onto the actual review! Im spite of the decision to split the film into two parts, everything still couldn't be included. It's best to judge it only as a movie, like the others, rather than as an adaptation of the book. My rating of the movie is 5 out of 5 stars. One of the reasons is that the characters have greatly developed from what they once were. Character development is always very important to anything that has characters, and no character development usually makes you not care about the characters at all! An example of this is Severus Snape. In the first two books and movies, Snape is purely hateable. There is a bit of humor behind the fact that Snape is so detestable. For instance, Snape makes up new rules just to have an excuse to take points off Gryffindor. In the third book and movie, it shows that Snape wasn't always to blame though. One time, he was almost killed, as a prank. In the fourth, it's shown that Snape is a spy for Dumbledore. In The Order of the Phoenix, despite the fact that Snape is even worse to Harry than usual, without him Harry would be in a much worse predicament than he was, at the end of the book (and film). In the sixth one, it's very obvious that he's evil. For those who haven't read the book, I won't spoil it, however Snape is still more complex than good or bad. Another example of character development is the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. My final example is how Dobby came from being a miserable house elf who usually got Harry injured in his attempts to help him, to a worker at Hogwarts. Dobby then strives to return the favor. Another reason this film merits a 5-star rating is the little touches added to the adaptation. For instance, the scene with Harry and Hermione dancing, after Ron leaves. Another such touch is the animation going with The Tale of the Three Brothers, when it is read aloud by Hermione. The film ended perfectly, leaving you wanting more. Nevertheless, it's very aggravating that we'll have to wait about 7 months to see the next one! In my opinion, the film was made stronger by introducing the Hallows themselves in this first act, rather than squeezing them into the second and making it look like an afterthought. The acting, for the next example of the film's rating, is superlative and stupendous. Every single person was perfect for their role and, if I were the director, I would not cast anyone else. The visuals are also great, ranging from black gloominess to a busy ministry to nice beaches and to snowy forests. These are only a few reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows earns a 5-star rating.",1290816000,12,3086,4.473404255319149
3818044,4,B001UV4XI8,"I think director David Yates did as much with the material as could be expected. He got their best performances yet from the three stars, there was a little more humor than in the book (very welcome) and the outdoor locations were imaginative and in some cases majestic. All the vital plot ingredients were there to prepare viewers for the grand finale in part 2. Having said that, I found this an unsatisfying movie just because I wanted to see Part 2 immediately, not in 8 months' time. It's not that I don't know what happens, it's just that the first part of the movie resolves nothing. Once we see Part 2, it will be possible to pass a judgement on the whole. This instalment was good, but rather like trying to rate a meal when all you've had is the appetizer.

A warning: as is apparent from other reviews, this movie even more than the others relies on the viewer knowing the story in some detail before watching it. If you are a Harry Potter fan (like me), no problem. If you haven't got a good knowledge of the story so far, either bring yourself up to date with it up to the end of book/movie #6, or don't waste your time watching this one. It won't mean a thing to you.",1290729600,2,1181,4.2959641255605385
3818045,4,B001UV4XI8,"Fine, I confess; I didn't like the last Harry Potter book so much. It seemed very rushed, and the characters development just seemed to have stopping. For die-hard Potter fans, this movie DOES follow the book VERY well; but it also makes the characters more believable.
 For example, Ron is much more likeable in the movie. He's not perfect, but we can understand what Hermione sees in him. We get why he freaks out and why he's jealous of Harry. Hermione shines as a self-confidant, strong and smart gal more than ever. Harry is an understated character, but that works well. The casting is, as always, brilliant. Loved the casting especially of Bill and Mr. Lovegood.
 It's been a while since I read the book, but as far as I can tell, the movie left very little out, such as where Harry reads the encouraging graffiti at Godric's Hallow. Some scenes were added; Harry and Hermione's dance scene is great; I like how their relationship becomes closer, not quite romantic - we really feel how they're, for a time, the only person the other has. The Bill and Fleur wedding scene was altered; it's interrupted by a Death Eater Attack (which I found annoying). There was more action here than in the book; I don't remember the fight with Nagini the snake being so long; if you don't like snakes, don't watch that scene.
 Finally, another great thing about this movie is the landscape. I usually don't really notice the background in movies that much, but whoever was in charge of location was brilliant. Since the kids are apparating so often, they end up in completely different locations. From a snowy, sleepy town to the city to the beach, all the scenery is gorgeous.  I'll admit that, in the book, I felt lost without Hogwarts. This movie is VERY different from the others, but I actually liked it better for that. Because the characters and special effects were still brilliant, it just felt like going on a more grown-up, exciting adventure than before!
Love the movie, can't wait for the next, and hope this review helps!",1290729600,2,2027,4.685393258426966
3818046,5,B001UV4XI8,"Other reviewers have stressed the importance of doing some background homework before seeing this movie.  That's because the film, while making sense to people who've seen the others and read the books, won't to those who haven't.  Even if you are a diehard Harry fan, you'll probably have your own opinions about what ought to have been included, and what wasn't.  You may feel that some characters deserved more screen time and more of a backstory. But you'll probably agree that the second-to-last movie in the ""Harry"" series does a more than competent job of adapting the (unwieldy plotwise) book.

If you're going in cold, you may wonder things like, ""What the heck is Horcrux?""  ""Why aren't the kids still in school?""  ""Who are all these characters that only get a few minutes of screen time and disappear without any real explanation?"" and so on.  Well, the kids have decided not to return to school after Headmaster Dumbledore's death in the last movie.  A Horcrux is a piece of soul, and Voldemort has figured out a way to split himself into seven different ones. Before the final showdown with Voldy, Harry must recover all these Horcruxes. That's why he goes on that camping trip with just his two pals.  Harry also has a telepathic connection with Voldy (again not explained) which allows him to be suddenly plunged into Voldy's memory.  That accounts for some of the odd flashbacks.

For most of the movie, Harry, Hermione and Ron are on their own, dodging the frequent magic hurled at them by Voldemort's crew, while searching for Horcruxes and trying to decipher why Dumbledore left them each a gift in his will. Most of the major characters from the previous films (who haven't died) pop in for an appearance including Alan Rickman as the nefarious Severus Snape; Imelda Stanton as former Hogwart's Headmistress who now holds a position in the Ministry of Magic; and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis who has also been forced to grow up rather fast. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort capably as usual, but the villian who looks like she's having the most fun is Helena Bonham Carter, as Bellatrix.  (Sadly, there is no Neville, but I expect we'll see him in the next film.)

You could argue that so much of the movie is unrelentingly bleak, spends too much time on the Great Camping Trip, etc., but all these things can also be said of the book it's based on.  I, for one, felt a bit cheated at having to wait for yet another film, but to be fair, I don't see how the book would be better as a single film. So I'd recommend it anyway.",1290729600,2,2556,4.651111111111111
3818047,5,B001UV4XI8,"I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.

The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.

Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.

I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.",1290729600,3,2451,4.486486486486487
3818048,5,B001UV4XI8,"I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans:  my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!).  All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards.  All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name.  The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power.  The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes.  If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.

My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees.  While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie.  This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron.  These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way.  These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey.  Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the ""dream scene"" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be).  Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.  The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness.  The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die.  And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do:  whets our appetites for the final installments  I know I can't wait until July.  The final movie promises to be the best yet.

Side note:  As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film.  He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies.  It is wonderful to see that even after all this time, Harry Potter still captures the hearts and imaginations of millions of children of ALL ages.",1290643200,5,3017,4.47985347985348
3818049,5,B001UV4XI8,"This movie was made of awesome.

I haven't reread the book, as I've done previously with the films, so I wasn't in my nit-picking mood.

Plus, the special effects looked fabulous. Both Dobby and Kreacher looked real and, although my brain knows that Nagiri isn't real, my eyes couldn't tell that.

The trio are so much better actors now than they were in the previous six films - whatever advice or acting lessons they took paid off.

Alan Rickman appears in the film not nearly enough but steals the show for the 2 milliseconds he is on screen.

I thought that the storyline and the necessary revisions, as well as additions were handled well. I would see this movie again in theaters. Soon.",1290556800,2,692,4.59349593495935
3818060,3,B001UV4XI8,"In part seven of the Harry Potter series, we see great actors either returning to reprise their roles or showing up for the first time. Returning as a Ministry of Magic employee is former Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher and temporary Headmistress of Hogwarts Delores Umbridge, played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunten. Joining the cast for the first time is the amazing Bill Nighy (Still Crazy, Shaun of the Dead) playing the new Minister of Magic (unfortunately too short- lived a role), as well as the brilliant Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, and the underrated Human Nature) as Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end what really makes this movie great is the characterization. This film would not work were it not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint doing their jobs properly. In Deathly Hallows, it's Rupert Grint who really delivers. Rupert has always been the comedic relief of the group, but here he provides the dramatic tension and performs beyond admirably.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is all about character development. Yates, who's now directed more Harry Potter films than any other director in the series, does a great job of creating a film that maintains tension both between its main characters and the ever-present forces of good and evil that dominate the wizarding world. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is not about action or plot development; it focuses its attention largely on the people involved in these extraordinary adventures. J.K. Rowling gave us all a gift by creating such memorable figures to populate her books, and the directors of the Harry Potter films develop these well-loved characters against a brilliantly realized backdrop.

[Spoiler Alert: If you have not read the books or seen the movie I recommend that you not read past this point]

That said, Deathly Hallows is not without its flaws.  The changes that were made to realize this story in cinematic form are rather problematic. There's no full explanation as to why Dobby is around, so had you not read the book his presence might have been confusing. Kreacher's actions are also a mystery, as the troublesome house elf acquiesces too soon and easily to Harry's request without further explanation. Were it not for plot holes of this nature, this film would be much better. As the series has progressed, it seems that the Harry Potter films have strayed further and further from the source material. I'm a big fan of Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince, both directed by Yates, but those movies left viewers ill prepared for this installment.

The problem with converting this series into film form is the same as it is with any movie based on a book: the conflict that exists between the viewer's perception of the book and the director's. Most people would say that there has to be something wrong with either the viewer or the director when it comes to an adaptation of a novel, but in reality there's nothing wrong with either--they just sometimes differ. When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a fan of both the books and the film adaptations, and one of the things that I like about the movies is the vision of the director. Yates has been brilliant at building these characters beyond what we've seen from them previously, and he continues to do just that in Deathly Hallows. There are things I would love to see in the movie adaptation, such as Kreacher's story of how he helped Regulus recover the locket, but would that detract from the story of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron? Most likely. That's why Yates is great. He knows where the real brilliance of the story lies, and that we can fill in the details by reading the books. He puts on film only what we need.

Unfortunately, Yates is the fourth director involved in this series and the only one making these films with a knowledge of how Harry Potter's story ends. As a result, he's had to include things in this film that don't seem to make sense because of omissions made in earlier installments. Had Dobby been more involved in Goblet of Fire, his presence in this film would have seemed more logical and his death would have been more meaningful to the movie viewers who haven't read the books.

[End of Spoilers]

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a good movie, but not the best of the series. To a point it feels slightly episodic and ends quite abruptly. The acting is amazing, and the visuals are brilliant. One can't help but get the feeling that this is leading to something bigger.",1290556800,41,4529,4.760509554140127
3818061,5,B001UV4XI8,"""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction -- the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale -- the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived."" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.

This is another excellent ""Harry Potter"" film that is just as excellent as its other sequels before it. This is a well-made and well-crafted film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is one of the best films, if not, the best film, of the holiday season.",1290384000,2,5455,4.844587352625938
3818062,5,B001UV4XI8,"If you love the book, you will LOVE the movie!!  They did a great job and the only things that were added were even better than the book!  I think it is definitely one of my all time favorites!",1290384000,,193,3.923076923076923
3818063,4,B001UV4XI8,"As always, I must start my latest HARRY POTTER review by stating that I have never read any of the books and thus cannot weigh in on their faithfulness.  I enjoy the films, but have never enjoyed them so much that I want to read the books.  I've been okay with the every year or two 2.5 hour dose of Harry and his friends.

DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1 is the first half of the final chapter in the saga (as virtually anyone who draws breath knows already).  And as the first 6 films can be said to be a build-up to the final chapter, this first part of that final chapter is a great deal of build-up with relatively little payoff. At least, from a pure plot perspective, not a lot fills up the 2.5 hours this time.

But if you're interested in the relationships, particularly between Harry, Ron & Hermoine, this is a very satisfying chapter.  In fact, much of the film focuses almost exclusively on these three friends.  Hogwarts is not glimpsed at all, and many of the recurring characters we've grown to know over the course of the series are scarcely seen (Snape, for example, appears in only one scene) or missing altogether (no Maggie Smith at all).  The movie has a chilled, insular feeling to it.

If you are unfamiliar with the basic story and plot of HARRY POTTER...I'm sorry, but I am not the best person to give you that kind of background.  Presumably, if you're interested in this film, you've got a familiarity with the story that has come before.  If not, you need to go back to the very first film and start there.  It would be a heck of a ride.

In THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, we see that the world of magic is descending into a frightening political mess.  The Ministry of Magic is turning into a fascist state, and ""good"" wizards and witches the world over are in hiding and being hunted down.  It's a dangerous time for all.  And we also know that the evil Lord Voldemort is preparing to confront Harry and then move on to dominion over all.  Times are bleak, and the film is literally dark throughout.  In the early going, there are some ""funny"" moments (one in particular features all of Harry's friends drinking a potion to make them look like him...there are some priceless reactions), but for the most part, the film is grim.  Eventually, Harry and his two closest friends literally go into hiding from the rest of the world...traveling through desolate landscapes in search of a way to destroy a Horcrux (a talisman that holds, I think, a portion of the soul of Voldemort).  They also seek more Horcrux's...and other stuff too.  I'm unclear on some of this, because honestly, the details of what all Harry and his buddies are trying to accomplish seem somewhat vague to me.  I just kind of take their word for it.

So as they run around the forest, or around lakes or other landscapes that look terribly windblown, these three face their own first truly adult arguments, hurt feelings, etc.  As you may know, Ron loves Hermoine.  Hermoine feels the same way, but hasn't worn those feelings on her sleeve...so when she and Harry appear to grow closer...Ron feels alienated.  He's never been the bright one or the magically adept one in his group; now he feels totally useless, resentful and hurt.  It's perhaps too simplistic to say they've got a love triangle going...their feelings are a bit more complicated than that, given all the external stress they're dealing with as well.  In these scenes, which are infused with the sadness of friendships that are losing their childlike innocence, the three young actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint) do some of their best work ever.  This must come, at least partially, from the fact that these three kids have grown up together on the set of these movies.  They have an ease together that they never achieve when onscreen with other performers.  Many of the scenes have relatively little in the way of special effects going on.  It's just two or three kids, sitting in a tent, or in the woods, having whispered conversations.  Depending on how much you enjoy this series for the character development of Harry, Ron & Hermoine will determine how much you enjoy DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1.

If I make the movie sound small and contained, there are some BIG scenes that take place in the wonderfully rendered Ministry of Magic that nicely remind us that money is no object when it comes to these films.  The movie isn't skimping...the story just seems to be drawing in a deep, slow breath in preparation for all hell breaking loose.

I look forward to the final movie.  DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1 did a great job in building that anticipation (and contains a great final moment that practically makes you cry out at how badly you're left hanging).  It's not the greatest movie in the series (it's tough to say which film IS the greatest, but I might lean towards GOBLET OF FIRE, with it's wonderful mix of the grand, the comical and the scary), but for fans, it is essential and rewarding viewing.",1290384000,,4960,4.594318181818182
3818064,5,B001UV4XI8,"Oh how dimwitted yet incredibly intelligent Ron can be at times, as the above statement shows. He understands that the war that Voldomort has waged isn't just about Harry. Yes, he is a huge factor; but not the whole reason. And this film really starts to show us just how big this ""war"" has become. Reaching so far as to take over the ""secure"" and ""powerful"" Ministry of Magic, and even taking over the sacred halls of Hogwarts itself.

But, Harry is still a large part of the war. He is the figure that the good stand behind now that the thought to be immortal Dumbledore is no more.  And with that knowledge, so this film begins. Dumbledore is dead, and Harry is left clueless as to what he is to do with the fragments of knowledge that were left to him. He knows he must destroy the remaining Horocruxes; magical items housing split pieces of Voldomorts soul, keeping him immortal. But what are these items, how do you destroy them, and most importantly how do you find them. This is the main focus of Part 1. After realizing that he is not safe anywhere he goes, Harry with his trusted friends Ron and Hermione go on the run to find these remaining objects and learn how to destroy them.

Deathly Hallows is one of the most well structured films of the series to date. Many things that the amazing J.K. Rowling wrote in the novel would have weighed the film version down and made it feel disjointed, but Steve Kloves has done a magical job at finding the root story, and side stories that are relevant to this. He has also given us one of the most emotional scripts, delivered with true and powerful performances by all; particularly by our core three. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have truly become amazing actors/actresses. So many scenes in this film are very depressing and filled with tension and all three deliver. Small additions also make the film all that much more amazing. The dance that Harry and Hermione share after Ron abandons the cause, is truly heart felt and sweet.

But the action and set design are also astounding. The opening chase sequence with the multiple Harry's being chased by the death eaters through the skies and streets of London was amazing and intense. And the infiltration of the Ministry to steal one of the horocruxes is ingenious and while funny, very intense as well, and also gives us the chance to once again see the amazing Imelda Staunton as the ever nasty Dolores Umbridge. The chase between the snatchers and the trio near the end of the film is also very intense.

Giving props to Daniel, Emma and Ron is commendable but the supporting cast is also amazing. Ray Fiennes as Voldomort is as always creepy and nasty as Voldomort. And Alan Rickman; although underused; steals every scene his character Severus Snape is in. But I must say that the stand out in this film to me was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange who played the role with such cunning and murderous venom that she stole each and every scene she was in. Her torturing of Hermione was a terrifying scene to hear and behold.

Death is also a major theme in this film, we loose several loved characters and many people are scene dead or worse in the film, so to all those thinking of taking their little kids, I'd say no. The film is very dark and morbid, and has a very forboding sense of dread hanging over it. This is not Chamber of Secrets or even Order of the Phoenix.

I was immensely satisfied with this film, even if it was incomplete, but it is a step in the right direction. I have been, unlike some, very impressed with the last few films, enjoying the more mature and tense filled films.
With Half Blood Prince being my favorite to date, even better in my opinion than this one. So if your wanting to see a truly gripping film than go see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1.",1290384000,5,3809,4.495664739884393
3818065,5,B001UV4XI8,"It's hard to believe we've now been living with Harry Potter for going on 12 years for Americans, and 13 years if you're British since the first book was published in the UK as ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in 1997 and ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" in the US in 1998. In the first installment of the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I, the entire Harry Potter enterprise has literally come-of-age. The story and characters have matured along with the writer, her readers/film-goers, as well as the actors in the primary roles. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe in the roles of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter have grown up along with their youthful wizards, and the actors themselves are fast-earning the right to be regarded as A-list talent. Hopefully, they will have fine careers ahead of them, assuming they won't be forever type-cast as the Hogwarts wizard students of the Harry Potter novels. And of course, the ultimate credit of the series belongs to J.K. Rowling who has created a universe as recognizable as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, Stephen King's Dark Tower, and Anne Rice's 18th and 19th-century vampire societies.

The rest of the cast of ""HP and the Deathly Hallows"", aside from the young leads, comprises bona fide A-list actors who were already demonstrating the heights of their craft long before J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter in tea shops as a single mother on welfare in Britain. Ironically, the names topping the list play the villains and dark characters: Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. Special recognition has to be paid to Fiennes as Voldemort whose demonic persona makes the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster appear more like bank robbers by comparison. Fiennes, despite the warped face and absent nose, is entirely believable as the sworn enemy of Harry Potter and an adversary to all that is good in the Wizard World.

However the crux of the tale (as with the rest of the series), surrounds the three young leads inside an incredible production. The first couple of installments were written more for a younger age group. Now the characters and their respective actors have grown in complexity and subtlety. They reside inside the skins of their characters in ways which make you believe they understand and appreciate them more. No longer the smart class show-off of younger years, Hermione has grown into a young woman beginning to appreciate more fully the powers she has been taught which can transform the world rather than simply being the most-liked by her teachers. Weasley has a better sense of himself and is now dating Hermione which would have been unthinkable in the first few Harry Potter stories. And Harry Potter is nearing the moment when he can face Lord Vortemort as a near-equal without cringing at the sound of the name.

The plot of the present installment is the most complex and compelling yet. Voldemort has gained power over the Ministry of Magic who are running the wizard government akin to Nazism of the 1930's. Anyone with ""muggle"" (i.e. non-wizard) blood risks being expelled and/or subdued by high-ranking officials in kangaroo courts. They have even placed a roman-inspired relief in the wizard town square showing muggles being subdued by magic. Although the wizard ministry and government are run by mortal wizards, Lord Voldemort is pulling the puppet strings like a demonic equivalent of the Godfather. He is on the verge of gaining complete immortality through the Horcrux's, amulet artifacts which also have an interesting side-affect of making the wearer become more self-absorbed and selfish, not unlike the Ring of the ""Lord of the Rings"". Dumbledore had begun the mission of destroying the Horcrux's as a means of defeating Voldemort; the mission now is passed onto Harry Potter and his friends. Harry Potter along with allies escort him to a refuge but are immediately besieged by the soulless dementors. There must have been a traitor among them which tipped off Voldemort.

The three young wizards then engage in a two-fold quest: to obtain and destroy the Horcrux's to stop Voldemort from permanently gaining immortality thereby becoming the absolute-ruler of the Wizard World for eternity. Think of Adolph Hitler wielding a wand. Unfortunately, the Horcrux's appear indestructible, and they must obtain an artifact willed to Potter from the late Dumbledore, a sword, Godric Gryffindor, which Hermione realizes may contain enough power to destroy the Horcrux. During their quest, they keep stumbling upon a strange triangular symbol, which even appears on one of the stones of a cemetery at Harry Potter's birthplace which is also his parents' deathplace.

A brilliant and compelling film all the way around despite having been absent from Hogwarts, with absolutely phenomenal effects which neither impedes the story nor hinders the acting but enhances the Wizard World and the story contained within. The acting is some of the best I have seen for a fantasy film/story, it's only rival Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"". The best which can said of this film is that it never appears like the filmmakers were relying solely on the Harry Potter name for success. They have forged a brilliant film to climax the series, one of the best all-time in fantasy-filmmaking.",1290384000,2,5417,5.068385650224215
3818066,5,B001UV4XI8,"While keeping the plot discreet, I must start off by saying that this one of the best installments of the series to have come out since the first movie. I have been fortunate in being able to see all the Harry Potter installments, including this one. However, I must say that from my perspective, that the movie is so intense, that anyone that is 12 or under may need a person to accompany them that is at least 18 or over. I say this only because I feel that this movie is terrific, but it is much more intense than the other installments. This movie finds Harry Potter and his friends coming to terms with learning who is truthfully on their side and the people that he knew that went to the dark side. There is strong romantic chemistry between both Hermoine and Harry and Hermoine and Ron that you end up wondering how the future between the three of them is going to unfold. From the beginning the movie carefully paints a picture that one cannot overcome the trials of life alone. Once again in this movie, the viewer gets to see many of the people that are going to be a part in helping Harry and his friends along their journey. This series has alot of good special effects and scenery that both adults and children are going to love. The plot, all the way up to the ending is very well developed that time really flies when you see the movie. Many of the events in the movie are very exciting and leave you in suspense. Last, but not least, I enjoyed the Harry Potter movie that was released last summer. However, I would have to say that this movie (the Deathly Hallows one) is definitely better than last years, and many like myself are going to feel that it is even better than the first (which is saying alot, because the first installment is a classic).",1290384000,,1767,4.357575757575757
3818067,5,B001UV4XI8,"Part I of the Deathly Hallows is faithful to the book for the most part.  Although a few things were cut out (such as the evil werewolf Greyback with the Snatchers or cutting out the Harry/Lupin fight in favor of a cute tent dancing scene with Hermione) the overall spirit of the film was faithful to the book.

Director David Yates I feel did not make a great film with Order of the Phoenix but clearly redeemed himself in my eyes with this film.

The film felt rushed at first. In the book there was more build-up with Uncle Vernon.  On the other hand, Harry's contemplation of the little stairway closet he used to live in, you can almost hear him say ""Wow, I've come a long way.""

And indeed he has.  He wants no one to be hurt or injured and would rather go off on his trek on his own.  But Ron and Hermione will have none of it. and go Disapparating all over the English countryside with the Death Eaters hot on his tail.

Several scenes they got right:  Ron's anger and jealousy with Harry and Hermione.  The Patronus doe to the lake where the sword of Gryffindor is laid.  The snake attack at Bagshot's place.

And most amazingly, the great animation of the Three Brothers tale, as told by Hermione (and interrupted by Ron a couple times)!

Nitpicking Follows!

Several things I would have liked to have seen:  More of the elf Kreecher and his explanation of Regulus Black's switching of the Horcrux at the lake introduced in the previous film.  And in the book, Harry's disguised self at the Ministry of Magic enabled him to free many people from the dungeons of the Ministry but that didn't happen here.  And more of the radio -- there was a lot more going on with the radio broadcasts {Potter Watch}, like a Radio Free Wizard or something!

Final Thoughts:

I can see a person not having read the book might have some trouble with parts of the screenplay.  Reading the book clearly helps in filling in the gaps.  The snappy dialogue and the deep emotional investment by the audience is wrenching.  But the occasional humor (the tent scene) was cute.  And the soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra was superb.

It's going to be a long wait to this summer!",1290297600,81,2171,4.465648854961832
3818068,2,B001UV4XI8,"I swear Harry has no power in this film, the most powerful thing in the movie are the elves who save everyone two or three times. Harry is nothing more then hype in this movie and is dragged around being saved by the whole good guy gang thru this whole Lobsterfest. Please give Harry some kind of power how can he be a hero of any sort when he can't wipe his own bum. How this painful excuse for a Harry Potter film gets a A- rating is beyond me. This movie should have been one hour long, but oh no we have to pad this snoozefest out to make two long and very boring sleep aids (maybe part two will have more action). This film would make my list of biggest disappointments for 2010, so if you have not seen this film I would wait for a cheap rental.",1290297600,8,751,4.013333333333334
3818069,5,B001UV4XI8,"The beginning of the End: The first installment of the last HP novel is here... Easily the BEST of the film series adaptations. There was so much plot damage control to be done due to the copious story cuts on the previous films that it seemed impossible to make Deathly Hallows true to the text. But thanks to stretching this one to a 5 hour project and some character stacking rivaling a Dagwood sandwich, HP Vii part one, is a promising start.

The cavalcade of cameos may make your head spin, but it serves to make Harry's story more whole and his quest to find and destroy Voldemort's splintered soul richer for it. Appearances i feared we would never have, like older Weasley brother Bill just in time for his wedding, and complete with werewolf scars. Another, belated introduction, new minster of magic Rufus Serimgeour, played Brilliantly by Bill Nighy (what a Doctor [Who] he would have made!) but oh so briefly, if only he had been in Order of the Phoenix. Also perfectly cast and missing from wayback, oily sneak thief Mundungus. The. Jar-Jar Binks of the wizarding world Dobby briefly returns. As does wandmaker Ollivander and goblin Griphook return. Dobby's appearance is much better than his first, although much impact is lost due to his absence from HP 4-6. But, as if to make up for this one of my favorite Dobby lines cut from Chamber of Secrets is sort of included in Hallows, ""Dobby never meant to kill, maim, ...but never kill.""

Let's not forget our title character and his faithful sidekicks, Watson, Grint and Radcliffe each really comes into there own as actors here as Hermionie, Ron & Harry. Especially Grint's superbly-done jealous Horcrux-weary Ron. The rest of the wizard staples are there, if very briefly, A  few stolen moments w/ Ginny, a brief hint at (hopefully) heroic things to come from less homely Neville Longbottom.  The Muggle staples: the Dursleys, are on screen so briefly the point of the appearance is lost, really there isn't the closure of the text or the film series there at all.

The effects as always are great, no glaring problems like, the centaurs & trolls of Sorcerer's Stone. The Opening chase from Privot Dr. is proof that the visuals are solid enough as are subtler moments like the raising of the Wedding tents. The music by Alexandre Desplat(composed Benjamin Button and Fantastic Mr. Fox) is pretty good but, sadly not any real substitute for Mr. John Williams.

One nice touch to watch for is the retelling of the tale of the Deathly Hallows at Luna Lovegood's home accompanied by shadowpuppets via CGI, lovely and dynamic.

Beautifully shot, plenty of interesting location work, perhaps the only disappointing aspect, other than the fact that we must wait for the big finish in July, is the lack of Hogwarts in the story... But, in my opinion, this only serves to strengthen the feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness of the state of things... Readers know this potential disappointment however will be rectified in part 2.",1290297600,4,2991,4.830078125
3818080,3,B001UV4XI8,"This movie reminded me of March of the Penguins.  We watch the trio of kids traipse all around England like the penguins marched around Antarctica in MotP, and the pacing of the movies was eerily similar.  Just as an occasional polar bear-ish siting would happen to liven things up in MotP, there is an occasional villain popping up in this movie to liven things up.  Both movies also lack a driving narrative.  In MotP, the penguins just go back and forth because that's what they do.  Here, the trio look for horacruxes because...well, because...well, because they have to!

It was nice to look at, the acting is fine, and I am eager for Part 7.  I'm hoping Part 7 delivers all of the excitement that this movie was missing.",1290297600,5,726,4.5813953488372094

3818082,4,B001UV4XI8,"*SPOILERS*

Book 7 was not my favorite book, mostly because I feel like Rowling just killed people off for the sake of killing them off, and she really should have let SOME of my favorite characters live through it.

That being said, part one was pretty true to the book (as others have stated), so most of my complaints about it are the same ones I had about the book (too slow, Ron being whiny, too many pointless deaths, etc).  I really did not enjoy the dance scene between Harry and Hermione.  I felt uncomfortably like a peeping tom while watching it (I don't go to movies to feel uncomfortable), and I don't like that they tried to create ""tension"" between Harry and Hermione.  They are just friends, and I don't know why they decided to spend 30 seconds flirting with the idea of 'more'.

I really did not think that they gave Hedwig's death enough time or showed very well how upsetting it was to Harry.  When Dobby died, I could not understand why someone didn't try to help him.  They just sat there looking sad at him.  Harry has been injured badly several times, and they always manage to heal him back up...but Dobby isn't worth it?

It really was too long.  I hate how all 'serious' movies seem like they are required to be over 2 hours long anymore.  This one, with a lot of material, could be justifiably long, but if I find myself sitting in the theatre hoping for it to end, then in my opinion the story or the director has at least partially failed.  I enjoyed the movie, but I still felt I was in that theatre for about 4 hours, and the last 30 minutes of the film every time the screen went dark I prayed that it was over.  I know that sounds conflicted, but its how I felt about it.

I also hate the ""shaky camera"" fad in movies over the last decade.  This one wasn't too bad about it, but it felt like all of the non-action scenes were filmed with a little flip camera by a high school student.  I wanted to shout at the director to invest in a tripod.

My only other minor complaint is that the director seemed to really enjoy having the bad guys straddle the good guys (dead or alive), and it felt awkward.

I still really liked it, but I won't be watching it again til it comes out on DVD, whereas previous installations I have seen in the theatre several times.  I will, of course, go see the second part, but I don't really look forward to it.  I don't want all the characters to die off.  I almost hope that pt 2 will be a classic example of hollywood rewriting so that at least a few of the good background people live.

To address the complaints of ""confusing"", my advice is to watch the first 6 movies.  its part 7.  its not supposed to be a stand alone.  if you've watched the first 6 movies, then its really not confusing at all.

so, to sum up (now that I've complained enough)
Pros:
great acting
true to book
good story
enjoyable

cons:
shaky camera
too long (multiple ""false"" ending spots)
awkward scenes that didn't 'fit'.

go see it in the theatre. its as worth the 10 buck admission price as any other movie of recent release.",1290297600,2,3067,4.285217391304347
3818083,2,B001UV4XI8,"I am immune to the appeal of the Harry Potter phenom. I try to watch the films every now and then to see if I can get a handle on what all the fuss is about. It still eludes me. I was bored through this movie, with one scene standing out as engaging and interesting and having some magic, some sparkle. Obviously, mine is not the majority view.

I find Daniel Radcliffe frighteningly cute. He's just a child! Scary. The scene where several Harrys remove their shirts at once - wow. Hand me my fan.

Ralph Fiennes is one of the all-time great film actors. He does evil very well - see ""Schindler's List."" Here he is wearing some kind of CGI no-nose Halloween mask and he doesn't raise so much as one goose pimple. Fiennes could have made this villain, Voldemort, really scary if they had removed the silly make-up/cgi. As it is, you look at him and think, poor guy, some kind of no-nose birth defect. It would be unkind to stare. Hire the differently abled!

I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I'd read a review saying that Hermione had to erase her family's memories of her, and that that was very poignant. That happens in an opening scene that lasts about a minute. Had I not read the review, I would have had no idea what was happening. Whatever was happening was not poignant to this viewer.

I didn't, and still don't, know what a horcrux is. Characters have magical powers, but which characters have which powers? Voldemort wants to kill Harry; Voldemort has magical powers. Why doesn't Voldemort just use his magical powers to kill Harry? What's preventing him? I have no idea, because I don't know how magical powers are apportioned, or resisted, in this world. There's scene after scene of wands and chases and searches and I never knew what anyone could do with what spell or wand, so I didn't know what was at stake and what needed to be done to protect what was at stake. At one point Ron tells Harry ""It's about more than you."" What is it about? Box office revenue.

There's a scene where Harry is caught under ice, alone in a forest at night: a real claustrophobe's paranoid nightmare. I found I could watch the scene without any anxiety. Now that's poor filmmaking.

There is so much stuff slathered onscreen: eccentric English cottages with floating pears growing outside the front door, magical tents, protective snowy owls, elevators that travel sideways - and I never once said ""Oooo"" or ""Aaaa"" (except for that scene where multiple Harrys bear multiple post-adolescent, nicely muscled, newly hairy chests - ooo baby). Nothing felt magical to me. The ever present onscreen junk all had the same, loud, tacky, K-Mart Christmas feel. ""Less is more"" anyone?

There was one scene that worked. I was caught up in it, and, even as I was watching it, I imagined legions of fangirls watching this scene again and again once the home version is released. Harry and Hermione are feeling low. They are alone in a tent in a forest. Music is playing on a staticky radio. The camera focuses on Hermione in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the view of Hermione is blocked by Harry's sweater-clad shoulder. In the same way that he is blocking the scene, he is overwhelming Hermione's consciousness. He extends his hand to her; she rises; they dance, their bodies directed by their despair, their hunger for intimacy with each other, and their fear that satisfying that desire is not a wise idea. It's a truly magical scene, and all too brief. And it required no special effects, just young people you care about who are trying to thrive, as all of us do, through contact, music, art, and dance, in a life-or-death situation.",1290297600,9,3653,4.593558282208589
3818084,4,B001UV4XI8,"As a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie very much, although a few things about the film could have been better.

The best thing about ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is that the producers were smart enough to split the final installment of J.K. Rowling's brilliant wizard saga into two films. As a result, not nearly as much content from the book was cut for Part I of ""Deathly Hallows"" as has been the case with the other HP movies. The book chronicles Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they decide to abandon their final year of education at Hogwarts and set off on a quest to take down the evil Lord Voldemort. What begins as a search for Voldemort's horcruxes also turns into a hunt for the three mysterious Deathly Hallows, along with a struggle for survival.

This is a very dark and intense film, and rightfully so, as the seventh book in the HP series is the most grim of all. The filmmakers got a lot of things right, but there were a few disappointments. (Note: a few spoilers are ahead.) I understand the need to omit material from movies to meet time requirements, and I even understand the desire to make small alterations so certain things translate better from page to screen. However, changing things just for the sake of changing them really irritates me. One thing that really disappointed me was the sequence where Harry is taken away from the Dursley residence, and a bunch of Harry Potters undergo an airborne attack by Death Eaters. That scene was way too short in the film, and for some reason half of it took place in the middle of a busy London street, which made no sense at all. Hedwig's death was also rewritten a bit, and in my opinion it happened way too fast and didn't do the poor owl justice. (At least the Dobby death scene was much better.)

I also wasn't happy that the film added some scenes that weren't in the book at all. This takes away from an opportunity to showcase more of the original plot from the novel. Why, for instance, include that stupid scene with Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent and cut the Harry/Lupin fight that occurs in Grimmauld Place? Most of the scenes that were new to the movie easily could have been omitted in favor of Rowling's original material.

In spite of those shortcomings, however. this is truly an excellent film. It was made for fans of the books, so critics who blast the film for being too long and dragging in the beginning obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The cast is amazing, the effects are phenomenal, and you REALLY need to see this movie in the theatre. I cannot wait to see the final movie next spring.",1290211200,6,2664,4.49793388429752
3818085,4,B001UV4XI8,"I like all six of the previous Harry Potter films, but I'm not a big fan of what director, David Yates, has done with the last two installments. Maybe it's just the source material, which I have yet to read, but while the stories have gotten darker (which I like), they have also become less interesting. I do understand that the innocence of the early films can't remain for the plot or characters to progress.

Now, having said all that, I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is very well done. Sure there are some overlong sequences, too many characters forgotten about due to the huge cast, and I do miss seeing Hogwarts, but judging by the first half of the final chapter, it's going to end on a high note. The main trio have all grown as actors in more ways than one. All of the supporting players we've seen over the years are a welcome sight, but like I said before, often given too little to say or do.

The CGI is impressive, yet not overdone, the music still remains gripping, but most important of all, I actually care about the characters and what lies in store for them in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.

Here's my ranking of the seven films thus far...

1. The Prisoner of Azkaban
2. The Goblet of Fire
3. The Sorcerer's Stone
4. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1
5. The Chamber of Secrets
6. The Half-Blood Prince
7. The Order of the Phoenix",1290211200,4,1360,4.363636363636363
3818086,5,B001UV4XI8,"Walking out of the screeing, one of my friends remarked that he hated this Harry Potter film, stating it is the ""worst"" in the series. I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Pt. 1 is just buildup.

If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticize anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.

Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron.  In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine.
The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.

The deathly Hollows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.",1290124800,197,2160,4.691292875989446
3818087,5,B001UV4XI8,"Given that the concluding novel in the Harry Potter series covers so much in terms of plot and characterization, it is fitting that the movie was divided into two parts. I was quite wary about this latest installment in the HP franchise after some of the liberties taken with HP and the Half-Blood Prince (though I still loved it). I feel that HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is one of the most (if not, the most) faithful adaptation of a HP novel to be brought to the silver screen. There is a perfect synergy of all the elements that made me fall in love with the story of HP as written in the books - great characterization made possible by credible and amazing acting; gorgeous cinematography; a score that perfectly captures the angst, tension, and drama of the unfolding story; and special effects that awe without overwhelming the audience or detract from the story.

The only thing I'd like to mention and I feel is important is that this particular installment really does require prior knowledge of the Harry Potter novels. This movie takes it for granted that viewers will be able to fill in the blanks, like why does Hermione have to perform a spell on her parents which erases her existence from their memories? Throughout the movie, little snippets of Potter lore are sprinkled about which will delight any devoted fan but might confound and frustrate any newcomer to the series (which is why I would recommend starting from the first movie and working one's way through the series, in order). To really understand all that is going on, and the significance of certain things unfolding during the movie, I would recommend reading the book (to be able to see a particular scene and think, ""That's exactly how I imagined it would happen!"" or ""Ahh, so that's the significance of the ..."" was an enriching and immensely satisfying experience for me).

I am not going to rehash the plot in detail - basically, this movie takes off some time after HP and the Half-Blood Prince ended. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) sends the Dursleys off to a safe spot as he prepares to go on his quest for the remaining Horcruxes which hold parts of Voldemort's soul. He is joined by best pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Part One of Deathly Hallows traces the trio's journey and sense of aimlessness (for they know not where the remaining horcruxes are); tension and strife between Ron and Harry; Hermione's sadnesss at losing Ron briefly; the constant pressure of being on the run; and perhaps most significantly, discovering that each of them truly have a purpose, that it is together and not individually that they are able to gain advantage over the Dark Lord. The actors who play the leads have truly come into their own and it is just amazing to see these young actors mature into and inhabit each of their roles with credibility and assurance, playing their characters with great depth. It is even more amazing given that they have been playing these roles for more than a decade, yet never do they show that they are tiring of their roles or just doing it for the money - there's real passion here.

My only grouse is that Snape (Alan Rickman) does not get much screen time, but I'm sure that will be redressed in Part Two where he plays a more significant role. Helena Bonham-Carter was a hoot to watch as usual, playing the maniacal role of Bellatrix Lestrange with a fervor unmatched by any screen villainess in recent time (at least in my opinion). Ralph Fiennes portrays the Dark Lord with a credible sense of evil and malignancy, though his appearances in this installment are mainly via flashbacks and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's thoughts.

Three things that caught my interest (well, many things actually, but these three were unique): The dramatization of the tale of the three brothers, i.e. the Peverell brothers was done via animation, and it is gloriously done, with understatement yet is effective in conveying to the viewer the significance of this tale to Harry's quest. Another was the controversial scene between Harry and Hermione (spoiler ahead!) - Hermione and Harry are shown in an intimate embrace during a confrontation with the Dark Lord's soul and Ron who has been beseeched with doubts regarding their relationship flounders whilst the clock is ticking. This scene was tastefully done, and not explicit at all (except for kissing), so the PG-13 rating is safe! Finally, the scenes of persecution against the Mud-Bloods were so well-done and captured the hysteria that was so reminiscent of another time in the past, i.e. Nazi Germany during WW II.

Overall, I feel this is a great set-up to the final installment in the HP series, and will especially please ardent fans of the novels. There is a perfect blend of drama, tension, bleakness, and even humor. Recommended!",1290124800,4,4840,4.798561151079137
3818088,5,B001UV4XI8,"The detail that made the first half of the book interesting, simply could not be supported in the film...we'd be watching until next Tuesday if that were the case!  School is out for Harry, Ron and Hermione  and things are very dark in the wizarding and the muggle world as Voldemort and the Death Eaters take over.  There is a horrible sense of foreboding and despair in this film and the tension is not so much in the action, as in the minds of our three heroes.  The actors did an excellent job of portraying three children who suddenly had to not only grow up, but also fight an evil that adults were failing to contain.

I badly wanted the movie to keep going through to the end of the story.  My hope is that when part II comes out, the theaters run part one and two together (with an Intermission...remember those?)

See Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in the theater, then get the DVD ... you'll appreciate a lot of the nuances that went by quickly on the big screen.  And we'll all count the days until July 15, 2011.",1290124800,3,1031,4.333333333333333
3818089,5,B001UV4XI8,"I'm so very happy that I can recommend this one without any hesitation at all!

The last couple Harry Potter films disappointed me in a myriad of ways. My disappointment didn't cause me to hate them, but I did feel let down and I have to admit that I found Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince pretty forgettable. But, being a Potter fan, I still found myself rushing out to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I today. And to my great relief and happiness, I loved it - really loved it! Yeah!

The chase of the Seven Potters by the Death Eaters and the trip to the Ministry of Magic are tense and exciting, the endless camping trip is just as effective at portraying the helplessness and frustration the characters are experiencing as it was in the book and the scene that gives us Hermione reading Beedle the Bard's ""Tale of the Three Brothers"" is riveting and wonderfully creative - much, much better than I would have thought it could be. We finally get to meet Bill (and Fleur's briefly-glimpsed wedding dress is gorgeous!) and the whipped cream on top of all this goodness is that the film is much more humorous than I expected. While not everything is included, of course, I didn't come out of this film grumbling things along the lines of ""How could they leave out _____?"" or ""Why did they add ________when it wasn't even in the danged book?"" - both comments I have been known to make after viewing some of the other films. Instead, I left the theater feeling like I'd seen a relatively faithful rendering of the ""real"" story. And there were even one or two things that I thought the film did better than the book, most notably the interruption of Harry & Ginny's kiss. The not-in-the-book added scene of Harry and Hermione dancing was both amusing and incredibly poignant - a true highlight of the film for me.

For some reason, the enjoyment this film gave me seemed to lift some sort of weight off me - which seems a very odd thing to say, I know. I think it returned a good deal of the joy I found in the earlier films - when seeing the characters and the places come to life on the screen was so magical. (That first glimpse of Hogwarts!) In a way, I feel like I'm back *in* - that I'm once again immersed in the film version of the story in a way that more closely echoes the effect the books had on me. While the films, IMHO, can never hope to match the books, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part I, let me feel the magic again. For that I thank everyone involved with it.

I thought the acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson was better than it's been in any of the Potter films - they really seem to have come into their own here. Helena Bonham Carter was freakishly perfect as usual, Jason Isaacs very good and Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood a welcome newcomer. The film sounds good - the score is a mood-setting addition to the film (especially effective, I thought, were the screeching radio sounds during many of the camping scenes) - and it looks even better. The shots of the English countryside are beautiful but often seem almost overwhelmingly empty and lonely - perfect for the story.

When it was announced that Deathly Hallows would be split into two films, I was glad because I hoped that by doing so the filmmakers would be able to do justice to the complexities of Rowling's plot. And now, having seen Part I, I feel that they've succeeded in doing just that. After this, I can look forward to the last film, not with dread, but with pleasure. And I am incredibly thrilled to be able to say that.

Very highly recommended!
