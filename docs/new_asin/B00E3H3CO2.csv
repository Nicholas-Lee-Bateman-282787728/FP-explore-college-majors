5887185,4,B00E3H3CO2,"This is a must-have film for fans of Peter Cushing, and for all fans of sixties and seventies drama.  That being said I give this release 5 stars and have to take it down a notch for the film itself.  The things that didn't work for me were the horrible jazzy score (this was the crossing point time of the popularity of jazz and beatnik music, and the rock and roll that was yet to come), most jarring in the first part of the film, and the somewhat bewildering ending.  I think a better editing job in fact would have made this a much tighter, effective film.  But what's to love?  You name it!  We have a wild and swinging (and after many repetitions in film, irritating) hippie party to start things off.  Of course it all goes wrong.  Then there is Cushing, a distinguished surgeon, going mad bit by bit -- only he could have pulled this off.  If it had been anyone else, I would never have believed it.  Then we have Sue Lloyd, glamorous as ever (in the beginning), also going mad, which is also entirely effective due to her acting skill!  Kate O'Mara rounds out the cast as Lloyd's sister who sees things coming apart.

Kudos also to the director for making these the most resistant victims you've ever seen when they realize what's up!  Everyone puts up a ferocious fight, and my eyeballs about fell out seeing Peter Cushing wrestling around the floor with a healthy lass who's determined to get out of it or strike back at him!  Without giving too much more away, I can only say the final chapters (with the exception of the very last scene, which is just bad) introduce a new twist to the whole film and ... you'll just have to see it to believe it.  I was thoroughly uncomfortable in the first part of the film, and then perversely wildly entertained during the last half of it.  Just redo the score and the very end and you have a classic.  I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers, though -- I think Peter Cushing's grimmest role was in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed -- a movie which begs for a blu ray release if ever there was one.  Oh, and as some have said, the photography and special effects (with the exception of one dodgy head in the final holocaust) are absolutely wonderful -- beautiful actual on location filming, and no hint of this all being a set, as seen so often in otherwise good Hammer films.

The extras are pretty good -- for now I've only gone through the alternative scenes, an audio interview with Cushing, and a jaw-dropping number of trailers for some movies that Grindhouse Releasing have released, and many that they intend to.

Ah, yes, this movie will also take you back to a time where girls were so slender they could be conveniently stuffed beneath the seats in a train. And remember, home laser use must be kept strictly under control!",1383350400,7,2795,4.443137254901961
5887186,4,B00E3H3CO2,"...or may ever want to see him again. 1968's CORRUPTION is surely the most uncharacteristic movie Cushing ever made. Not that he isn't his usual dignified self, it's just that every thing around him seems so whacked out. Actually it's vice-versa. This is Swinging London ca. 1967 and in this enviornment Cushing seems as out of place as prime rib at a vegan restaurant. That contrast is what gives CORRUPTION its raison d'etre but it remains a difficult film for long time fans of the actor to sit through. That doesn't make it a bad film just an unpleasant one. The plot is basically a rehash of the famous 1959 French shocker LES YEUX SANS VISAGE (Eyes Without A Face) in which a plastic surgeon desperately attempts to repair his daughter's hideously scarred face. In CORRUPTION instead of his daughter it's Cushing's beautiful much younger wife (Sue Lloyd) who needs the repair job. After the initial skin graft doesn't work Cushing is forced to go out and murder women for fresh grafts. Soon the younger wife has younger companions and this eventually leads to a wild finish with an out-of-control laser. And then...well, you'll just have to see it to find out or look it up which won't take nearly as long.

Watching CORRUPTION again after 3 years, in lieu of the new Blu Ray/DVD release and after watching countless British horror movies, I discovered what a really remarkable film it is from a technical standpoint. As another reviewer points out in greater detail, the film is beautifully photographed and the compositions of the shots themselves (ie. what's in the frame) are rather striking. D.O.P. Peter Newbrook would go on to photograph CRUCIBLE OF TERROR (1971) and direct THE ASPHYX (1973). The new release gives you the choice of the 1968 Columbia Pictures version that played in English speaking countries or the ""uncut"" European/Japanese version which features additional gore and nudity. Since this year marks the 100th anniversary of Cushing's birth, the release of CORRUPTION now means that all of his major movies are available in a Region 1 digital format. This Grindhouse release cannot be faulted as it contains loads of extras as well as both versions of the film. It's now up to you as to whether you want to see it. The 4 star rating is for the packaging, not the content. The poster (for the uncut version) says it all.",1382227200,5,2349,4.814356435643564
5887187,5,B00E3H3CO2,"After nearly a full year of suspense, the wait was over. I got my copy of Grindhouse Releasings 1968 Grand Moff Tarkin vehicle, CORRUPTION!

Let me preface the review by saying that I felt the advertising of this somewhat lost film went a little overboard, promising all this gore and nudity like never before seen. Upon hitting PLAY you are given a choice of  US/UK version  or International version. After running the International version I had wondered if a mistake was made at authoring and the version were inverted. It just didn't seem to capture the intensity conveyed by its nifty reversible cover (which is awesome). But I feel this is not the fault of anyone but my own insensitivity to gore and flesh. This is no Cannibal Holocaust but if you put it into perspective; big English actor (Mr. Cushing), the sixties, a comedian and a future East Ender, it was a pretty challenging work of cinema for its day.

That aside, Corruption is quite engaging and enjoyable. Story is pretty straight forward. This guy feels like crap because he accidentally got his trophy bride to be disfigured. Good thing he just happens to be a medical genius who can fix his womans disfigurement. At least temporary. Shes a vain chick who guilt trips him at every corner to keep her pretty. Oh, and to do this involves murdering other pretty chicks and cutting their heads off. Again, not the most amazing story, but quite effective in keeping things interesting and not feeling too hokey.

What really impressed me was Peter Newbrooks cinematography and Don Deacons editing. Both went very well together. The English countryside has never looked so unintentionally grand and breathtaking. Thats right. These guys do an excellent job at emphasizing lush backdrops without seeming like their emphasizing lush backdrops. Your eyes are fixed on the characters yet you find yourself stealing glances around the characters when they're not looking. Quite often times filmmakers come across as pompous narcissistic a-holes trying to add as much production value to low budget flicks as possible. That never feels the case here.

Music is also quite effective. Nothing like watching Grand Moff slit a topless whores throat open to some upbeat acid jazz. Quite jolly fun lads and lasses.

Huge kudos to Grindhouse for their excellent job mastering this film. Im sure its never looked nor sounded so fine. Vibrant colors that Im sure wouldve made Mr. Newbrook soil his pants had he seen. Grindhouse Releasing truly IS the Criterion of celluloid obscurity. As I mentioned earlier. The reversible packaging is awesome and Grindhouse trailers alone are worth the price of admission (quit teasing me with Gone with the Pope and announce a release date already will ya!).

If you appreciate cinema from an era long forgotten and want to witness just how much quality can be squeezed out of an old 1968 print, buy CORRUPTION. Just don't expect buckets of blood and yards of skin to satisfy your sick, deranged minds.

5887220,4,B00E3H3CO2,"This film seems to owe a lot to the old Paramount movie ""The Man in Half Moon Street"". There are several other movies that seem to have the same story. These include ""Leech Woman"" and ""The Man who could cheat death"", They are all well done and speak for the time in which they were made. This one is interesting because it shows how the doctor's wife is so obsessed with her beauty that she doesn't care about how he feels about killing people to keep her that way.",1408665600,,465,4.235955056179775
5887221,5,B00E3H3CO2,"After a famous surgeon named Sir John Rowan (Peter Cushing- DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS, THE GHOUL, THE SKULL) inadvertently burns his fiance, Lynn's (Sue Lloyd) face, disfiguring her, he becomes obsessed w/ restoring her to her original beauty. So obsessed in fact, that he bends and breaks some ethical / moral codes in order to accomplish his goal. When an untested procedure seems to work a miracle, only to fail in the end, Sir John must seek out new victims... er, subjects for his experimental surgeries. Spurred on by Lynn, Sir John is obligated to keep her face in super-model condition, even if he has to commit a series of grisly murders to do so! When a gang of thugs invades their beach home, things really get interesting! CORRUPTION is a mod, late 60s medical creeper that casts Cushing in a guilt-driven, tortured, psychopathic role. He is, as always, brilliant. Co-stars the lovely Kate O'Mara as Lynn's sister Val, and sports a groovi-licious jazz score!...",1402704000,,977,4.891566265060241
5887222,5,B00E3H3CO2,This was a very good horror movie. I loved that it had both the American version and the European version which had more bloody violence in it which makes it not for the faint of heart.

5887223,1,B00E3H3CO2,"I feel guilty criticizing a 40 something year old movie except that you can find better plot, acting, effects in a tele series 10 years older or another movie 30 years older still. Fans tend to lose brain cells no matter what they are fans of even those of Cushing and  Grindhouse as if they have some special immunity. Judging on merits; this was a waste. Even the clothing, dance & music of that period were poorly represented. Acting was especially bad. Storyline of a small scar on the side of our female protagonists face looked like poorly applied makeup and actually wasn't that bad. Cosmetic surgery, even then, would have corrected a good part of that issue. Typical bad science especially the laser flying about like a cartoon character. The cover, as is typical in these cheapies, was the hyped overrepresentation of the movie.",1395273600,3,838,4.779310344827586
5887224,5,B00E3H3CO2,"Being a fan of Hammer Horror movies and Peter Cushing, I was excited to check out a rare horror/thriller that I had never seen. While some reviewers have complained that the violence and nudity didn't live up to their expectations, I wasn't at all disappointed as I didn't purchase it for those reasons. I was much more interested in seeing a rare British horror film, and since Cushing made a typically brilliant performance, I came away very satisfied. I would liken his character to some of his later Frankenstein roles where the good doctor had somewhat of an edge to him. This story is set in the late 1960's in the beautiful UK countryside, and Cushing plays a tormented doctor that must kill in order to temporarily cure his wife's disfigurement. However, Cushing's diabolical actions come with a price as he pays for his transgressions against man and nature. The DVD also offered scenes deleted to graphic content, so it allowed the viewer to see both versions of the film. I thought the production values of the DVD were very strong and am very happy to finally see this movie released in the US.",1394236800,2,1106,4.706185567010309

5887226,3,B00E3H3CO2,"Peter Cushing's maniacal performance in the 1968 British horror flick ""Corruption"" was released on home video for the first time in North American this past October.  Cushing defies typecasting and plays an obsessed, knife-wielding, Ripper-esque, Gladstone bag-toting surgeon who harvests vital female organs from his unfortunate victims in order to heal the wounds of the woman he loves.  The story vaguely resembles the elegant 1959 French classic ""Eyes without a Face"".  But ""Corruption"" depicts it in fairly sensationalized manner that befits late-night, grindhouse viewing of the time: from over-the-top silliness, gratuitous nudity and gore (at least in the uncut version), to cliched fish-eye camera shots magnifying Cushing's madness.  There are a few calmer, surprisingly effective dramatic scenes that depict the doctor's devotion to his task, owing much to Cushing's acting ability.  Cushing used to portray gentlemen in films, and he once called ""Corruption"" one of the worst pictures he had made.  But the film has endured, and is regarded today as a cult classic.

A publisher aptly named ""Grindhouse"" released a 2-disc region-free Blu-ray/DVD combo set for North America.  It contains both the stronger, uncut version and the milder US/UK version.  If you want to see it uncut, go right to the ""International"" version on the disc, which actually runs shorter at 90 minutes, due to one scene that is shorter but gorier.  The US/UK version runs 91 minutes, with a longer but milder scene.  The two versions have no other apparent difference other than that one scene.

The uncut ""International"" version is on the Blu-ray disc only, while the milder US/UK version is on both the Blu-ray and DVD.

An informative audio commentary runs on both versions.  When you play the uncut version, you will hear different comments that apply to the gorier scene.

Both discs have great picture quality.  The Blu-ray's 1080p picture should look sparkling to those who saw old video editions, while the DVD has a nice down-converted picture.  The lossless mono 1.0 audio track on the Blu-ray is bright and clear.  The DVD's Dolby Digital mono track is fine too.

No subtitles nor closed captioning are present for the film and bonus features.

Bonus features include nice present-day interviews of 3 cast members (Billy Murray, Jan Waters, and Wendy Varnals), a vintage audio interview of Cushing, and an extensive photo gallery comprising hundreds of full-screen, high-quality scans of production stills and publicity stills.  Various trailers, TV spots, and radio spots are also included.

The DVD also includes a PDF file of the shooting script, which comprises of high-quality scans of original typewritten pages with the filmmakers' annotations.

This well-packaged release also includes a reversible cover sheet (the reverse side shows a gorier version of the front cover), and a liner sheet that unfolds into an enlarged version of the cover art.

There are even a couple of easter eggs on the discs.  In the trailer section, to the left of ""international trailers"", there is a hidden ""TFH"" hotspot that takes you to a two-minute review of the ""Corruption"" trailer by Edgar Wright of ""Trailers from Hell"".  To the right of ""Jan Waters interview"" is a hidden UK flag that takes you to another interview segment of Wendy Varnals, where she talks briefly about the rock stars she had met in her days as a TV host.  Both easter eggs are on both discs.",1386547200,6,3452,5.139784946236559
5887227,4,B00E3H3CO2,"Corruption has been a rare film for decades, and I am really pleased to see it finally releases on DVD and Bluray. This pack contains two separate discs, and the DVD and Bluray discs are identical, so you just choose which one you'd like to play.
Now onto the film itself. Corruption tells a familiar tale, in which a man is driven to madness by his efforts to restore the lost looks of his wife. The cure requires the use of the pituitary gland from other women, and let's just say that the women are not willing donors! Set and filmed in England in the swinging Sixties, the film has dated somewhat, especially evident in the ""groovy party"" opening scene, but apart from that silliness, the rest of if holds up pretty well. Peter Cushing is of course exemplary in the lead role of the doctor who kills to cure his disfigured wife. Even in the most lurid scenes (more of these later), he acts the part realistically and with dignity. Sue Lloyd plays the vain wife with the ruined face, and she also does well, portraying a nasty, selfish character that you really feel no sympathy for. It would be fair to say that she is the villain and Peter Cushing is the good guy in this set up, even though he does the killing!

A few things let the film down, some of it's very ""Britishness"" means that the violence can sometimes be ineffective, especially noticeable in a ""home invasion"" scene when a gang of thugs terrorise a small house - the gang don't seem threatening in the least, and I think it's a combination of the acting, the script and direction that no sense of real menace exists in this scene. It's a shame because elsewhere in the film all the acting is quite effective, but this confrontation is not, and it's pivotal to the climax of the film.

So what does work well? Well the performances, as I mentioned before, and this goes for most opt the rest of the cast too. Again to mention Peter Cushing, his most startling scenes are those in which he attacks and murders the female victims of the movie. Theres aren't many but seeing this mild mannered man observe, stalk, and finally attack his prey is very unsettling. Theres not a lot of overt gore in the film, but the scene on the train is effective even without it, as the sense of peril for the female passenger is quite well realised, and it's a nasty scene. Actually what bloodshed there is in this scene is actually pretty badly done!

Now for the most notorious part of the whole film: the scene in which Peter Cushing murders a prostitute. In the UK cinema release,, and in all the late night TV showings throughout the last 3 decades, we saw Cushing meet up with and kill a very chirpy Cockney ""call-girl"" who spent the entire scene wearing a pink fluffy bathrobe and died with almost no bloodshed or violence shown on the screen. Well, Grindhouse have done the impossible and unearthed the alternative footage that was only shown in some more tolerant Eurpoean and far Eastern countries at the time. In the alternative version, the whole scene was re-filmed using a different actress as the prostitute, with the bathrobe off so she is topless , and gore and violence in abundance! On the Grindhouse release, you get the choice of which version you'd like to see when you start the film. Let me say now that the difference is quite shocking. The ""strong version"" of this scene is outrageously sleazy. It leaves you in no doubt about what a horrible thing Peter Cushing's character is actually having to do. Quite an eye-opener.

Oddly, it's almost a shame that this murder was filmed separately, as it makes neither version of the film definitive. The ""mild"" version actually fits better with the overall tone of the film because the actress playing the prostitute can actually act and she is great. It also is much cleverer at setting up the actual kill scene, and it's pretty realistic, even if completely bloodless. On the other hand, the actress in the ""strong"" version is terrible, she makes a real mess of reading her lines (there are hardly any, the scene plays differently). You can't argue with the fact that it's very violent, but even this does make it feel quite different from the rest of the movie. The quality is great though, there's no difference between the two scenes in terms of technical terms, which is a great job on behalf of Grindhouse who were able to find this footage intact.

Anyway, that's the biggest news about this release, and it's really the answer to a fan's prayers. Corruption is a nasty, rotten story with nothing nice happening to anyone in it - and that's just the way it's supposed to be! Effective as much for the performances as the sick story, reviled at the time, rediscovered now, you could do a lot worse than to pick up a copy of this!",1384560000,10,4754,4.549065420560748
