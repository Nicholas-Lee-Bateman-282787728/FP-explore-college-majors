8195535,5,B000QCTG1G,A wonderful relaxing video shows you the beauty of Fall  in the Great Smoky Mountains. I try to go every year and always make pictures by this is so well done and the music is so relaxing that I put it in my DVD and watch it over and over. This is very well done. Color is beautiful and I cannot wait to go again next year. So glad I found it on amazon.,1422403200,,353,3.77027027027027
8195536,3,B000QCTG1G,"I really have expected to enjoy more of this landscape and more scenes of smoky mountains, instead I found zoomed scenes of leaves and more leaves and trees and that it is.",1407456000,,172,4.40625
8195537,3,B000QCTG1G,"I love the colors of fall, and since I live in Florida where fall colors are practically nonexistent, I thought this would be a good movie to have.  They must have filmed it in a year where the colors were muted, or maybe they hadn't yet reached their peak.  In places the colors were good, but other places, not so much.  At any rate, I was somewhat disappointed.  It was okay, but not great.  The music wasn't great, either.  How about ""Autumn Leaves"", the piano version by Ferrante and Teicher---that song would have been much better and much more appropriate. They could have alternated it with vocal versions of the same song by different artists.  I hope they make another fall color movie, in Blu Ray, with more vivid colors and scenes, and better music.",1323993600,,761,4.592592592592593
8195538,5,B000QCTG1G,Wow what a great dvd of the Smokies in the autumn without the crowds.  Makes a great souvenier of your vacation or it will make you want to visit the Smokies.  Wonderful gift for anyone who likes the mountains in their fall colors.,1323302400,,231,4.348837209302325
8195539,1,B000QCTG1G,"This video is a waste of money. The whole thing is ruined by the manufacturer putting his lage initials on the bottom of all the videos images. I paid for Autumn scenery, not for someones initials, that are meaningless and spoils the entire reason to be looking at this. Its distracting, and cheap advertising at the buyers expense.
Save your money and don't buy this dud.",1320451200,2,372,4.651515151515151
