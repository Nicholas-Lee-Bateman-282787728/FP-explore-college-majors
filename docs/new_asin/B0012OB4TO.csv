3092702,5,B0012OB4TO,"I purchased this several years ago at a Weight Watchers meeting.  I have used it since as my #1 exercise video.  When I don't want to go to the gym, this is my favorite way to get moving.  The dance option is my favorite.  It is easy, not too easy and keeps me interested.  I travel with this and use it weekly.",1390003200,4,311,3.9516129032258065
3092703,4,B0012OB4TO,"If you're out of shape and haven't worked out in awhile, this DVD is a great starting point. I consider myself at an intermediate level, so this DVD was too easy for me. I didn't break a sweat in the cardio or feel any muscle fatigue in the other sections. However, Petra is a great instructor and for someone just starting out, this is a really nice mix of exercises. I like the ability to do all the workouts, or just pick 1 or 2. The music is kinda corny and would probably start to get old if I did this DVD frequently.",1389744000,3,523,4.087378640776699
3092704,4,B0012OB4TO,"I bought it for lighter days when I don't feel like working out hard but I want to get my body moving and burn some calories! Good purchase for Beginners! If you are totally new to exercise this is a good DVD! I really love Petra as an instructor. She is so pleasant and upbeat without being overboard. Kat is the girl to follow if u are brand new to fitness. I have over 300 fitness DVDS and she is always the person who shows level one modifications. I love that that set is bright and colorful and that they use just regular ladies in the dvd. The twenty minutes will fly by and the steps are very easy to learn. There are five twenty minute workouts that you can rotate during the week or do one longer workout, Fat Burning Basics, Pilates/Yoga Conditioning, Cardio Dance, Toning, and Abs in 10. Great for an early morning workout when u you want something quick and fun to do!",1389139200,3,881,4.281437125748503

3092708,5,B0012OB4TO,"There are five workouts on this DVD, and you can mix and match them according to what you feel up to doing that day:  (1) Fat Burning Basics - 20 minutes of basic fat burning cardio; (2) Cardio Dance - 20 minutes of easy dance steps; (3) Toning - 20 minutes of toning your upper and lower body using hand weights; (4) Pilates/Yoga - 20 minutes of stretching and toning using your own body weight; and (5) Abs - 10 minutes of solid core conditioning.  Petra Kolber is a fun and engaging instructor!  You can do three of workouts for a great one-hour workout; but you could easily do two or just one of the 20-minute workouts if you were pressed for time or just didn't have much energy.
