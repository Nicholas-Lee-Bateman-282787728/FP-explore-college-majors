2369729,1,B000A6T2BM,"I knew going into the movie that it was going to suck, and when it was finally over I knew my intuition was correct. This movie was very boring, contrived, silly, and  devoid of comprension. No one over 10 years old will like this movie. Parents shouldn't take their kids to this pathetic movie unless they think bad movies is a good way to punish their kids. It was so sloppy much like an artist who throws paint on a canvas without judgement and calls it "" art"".  The 3-D glasses drowned out the colors and left the viewer with shadows of blue all over the place. This film was terrible. Anyone who gives this movie a 4 or 5 star rating is simply lying or they are the type of people who have no taste and in which case they shouldn't even be taken seriously. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money on this junk flop..",1118534400,5,837,4.192546583850931
2369730,1,B000A6T2BM,"This movie seems as if it was written, directed and produced by a group of 7 year old boys.  I can't imagine how this actually made it all the way to a theater near you.  Shark Boy & Lava Girl makes Power Rangers movies look like Citizen Kane.  While my own 7 year old liked it - that's probably the upper limit of it's audience.",1118534400,5,329,4.030769230769231
2369731,1,B000A6T2BM,"Most made for kid movies are still sort of fun for adults.  Not this one.  It is painful to watch, the story is stupid, the acting is bad the animation is weak, the ideas are bad.  I can't understand how a movie this bad ever got made.

Don't see it, don't rent it, don't buy the DVD.",1118534400,2,284,3.9298245614035086
2369732,5,B000A6T2BM,"Max is a daydreamer at school; his teacher Mr. Electricidad is always telling him to concentrate on his school work and live in the real world. His parents are always arguing about his dad(David Arquette) not having a real job(he's a writer), so Max keeps a dream journal where he writes about his imaginary creations(lava girl and shark boy)and their super powers along with an imaginary world(Planet Drool) where all kids' dreams come true(roller coasters, giant cookies, candy and no parents to tell them what to do).A bully(Linus) at school takes his journal and alters it and that's when things start to go crazy. Then one day there is a disastrous tornado and lava girl along with shark boy crash through the school's walls in search of Max whom they need the help of to restore peace to Planet Drool (Dr Electric is causing havoc and mayhem thanks to Linus' altered scheme in the journal).Max and his friends defeat giant sockets who try to zap them to death and they must find the heart shaped ice crystal to freeze time in order to save Planet Drool against the evil plan of its villains(Minus and Dr Electric). Much fun and action in 3d ensue (flying objects and cool things flying your way) all the kids in the theatre oooh and aaah with delight). Great scenic computer graphics and cool gadgets appear throughout. My nephews and nieces are all under 11 and they could not stop talking about this movie and playing the part of their favorite characters. This movie teaches kids to believe in their dreams and to work hard to make them reality. The film is action packed with non stop stunts (shark boy does his own in the movie), and funny blurbs by George Lopez (G-Lo) as the bad guy (he plays the voices of 3 animated characters in the film).Max and his friends save the day while teaching children to believe in their dreams and show us that we should not bring other peoples hopes and dreams down and that we must work hard for our dreams to become reality. Thank God we had our 3D glasses on because I could not hold back the tears when lava girl almost died only to be saved by Shark Boy and the fire from the volcano and Shark Boys' super speedy feet. At the end of the movie Shark Boy and Lava Girl learn their true meaning and purpose and we see where they were meant to live happily forever after peace is restored on Earth. Make sure you get the right glasses for your kids- they will be sad if they don't get the blue Shark Boy ones and the girls if they don't get the red Lava Girl ones. We all clapped at the end of the movie and I can't wait for the DVD to come out so we can all watch it again with Grandma and the rest of the Family. A must see.",1118534400,3,2673,4.3694779116465865

I would not recommend this for very young kids, since it has a story line and it might scare them.",1446768000,,262,4.0576923076923075
2371180,5,B000A6T2BM,"Sharkboy and Lavagirl is about a boy named Max who keeps a dream book. As trouble arises inside his dream world, Planet Drool, he is called upon by Sharkboy and Lavagirl to save it. Through this journey, Max grows from a boy with low self-esteem to one that believes he can conquer any task. Within the first few minutes of the movie, we see Max being bullied by Linus and his friends, which makes him feel helpless. This growth can be seen within the events of the movie that form the several genres that the film contains. These genres that Robert Rodriguez has instilled in the film cause there to be many incidents that are hardships that Max has to face which also help transform him into a confident human being.
Comedy is prevalent throughout the film, and is able to show Maxs transformation. A character that helps illustrate this genre is Mr. Electricidad. Just his appearance alone is humorous. He is wearing a striped shirt with a polka dot tie in his classroom. This adds a goofy effect because everyone knows that the two designs clash. His outfit also includes a lightning bolt pin on his tie, which is funny because his name is Mr. Electricidad. He constantly puts down his students, including Max. He even tells his own daughter that she has more boogers on her homework than there is actual homework in writing. This makes the audience laugh, but to Max, it may add to his initial feeling of helplessness. With the teacher being the only authoritative figure in the classroom, shouldnt he be the most comforting when the class if filled with bullies? This may cause Max to be unsure who to turn to in times of need when he is being bullied. The only positive part of Mr. Electricidads comedic comments may be that he picks on Linus, the bully, as well. He repeatedly calls him Minus. Even though it is funny to the rest of the class and perhaps even Max, it still implies that Mr. Electricidad will not comfort anyone and is willing to hurt any students feelings if necessary. This only adds to Maxs feeling of discomfort. Another comedic aspect of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is Maxs father. In fact, he enters the movie by scaring Max. He makes a lot of humorous comments but they have the potential to worsen things within Maxs family. A side story within the film that is briefly mentioned is Maxs parents leaning heavily towards getting a divorce. Max would have more hope of his parents staying together if his father was a more serious person. He calls Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Sharkgirl and Lavaboy. Those two characters are of huge importance to Max, so he most likely felt disrespected by his fathers comment. This has the potential to make Max think that his dad may not respect his marriage at times, causing it to seem as if the divorce is bound to happen.
This scene also plays into the genre of drama within the film. The dramatic events in this film add negative emotion on top of Maxs low self-esteem. For example, early on in the movie Maxs mother tells him that she and his father are no longer compatible. After this, Max states that he wishes anything would happen that day that would cause him to not have to go back home. It is unfair that Max has to deal with issues not only at home, but at his school as well. Whenever see the school in the film, it has dark clouds hovering over it, which symbolizes negativity with anything associated with the buildling. Its as if he cant escape sad situations. When he gets to school that day, Linus steals his dream book and scribbles all over it. As an elementary-aged boy dealing with many social issues, his diary is probably the only thing keeping him happy. The main drama in this movie is what is happening on Planet Drool. Mr. Electric, who is also Mr. Electricidad in real life, is trying to take over Maxs dream world. As a boy with almost no self-confidence, it seems impossible for Max to defeat Mr. Electric. In addition to this, Minus (Linus in real life) is also trying to conquer Planet Drool.
The effort to defeat Mr. Electric is the main component of the movie that forms its action/adventure genre. It takes place in the beginning when a lightning storm mixed with a tornado brings Sharkboy and Lavagirl into Maxs classroom. This action is the beginning of the adventure. It raises the question of how an unconfident Max is going to handle his dream world being under attack. Another important action scene is when Sharkboy and Lavagirl fight to stop the motion of a roller coaster that is never ending. There are kids trapped on the coaster that are screaming for their lives because they aren't able to get off. As Sharkboy and Lavagirl try to slow the coaster down, it just shows how helpless Max is. He seems to be useless because he can do nothing but sit in the coaster and watch. He doesnt even try to help because he doesnt believe that he can do anything. Shorty after this, another action scene takes place that has Sharkboy and Lavagirl fighting against Mr. Electric and his electric plugs that are alive. During this, they tell Max to show Mr. Electric what hes got. When Max tries to hit him, he gets shocked and is thrown backwards. This scene shows Maxs improvement, as he actually attempts to do something this time.  These action scenes appropriately show Maxs growth as a person.
We first see a glimpse of Maxs confidence when he attempts to strike Mr. Electric, but there are several other things that happen in the movie that contribute to his improving self-esteem. While on Planet Drool, Max learns that he can daydream. By doing this, he is able to fight off enemies even more effectively than Sharkboy and Lavagirl. In addition to this, Max gets Minus to join his side in the fight against Mr. Electric. When, Mr. Electric transports himself to the real world near the end of the movie, Max is able to control his dream and send himself back to the real world as well. Now confident as ever, he gives a girl in his class, Marissa, an necklace that gives her the power of the ice princess that she was in his dream world. Not only was Max now capable of fighting off enemies on his own, but he was also mentally strong enough to find ways to make other people believe in themselves as well. Along with all this, Maxs parents realized how much love they still have for each other and decide not to get a divorce. With the help of the main genres of the movie, Max is challenged with many obstacles. Each genre creates hardships. This is an impressive because even the comedic effect of the movie can evoke negative emotion from Max. The events within the genres of Sharkboy and Lavagirl build up to Maxs new and improved self, which allows him to turn his attitude and life around while also becoming content with his self image.",1446595200,,6743,4.563531353135313
2371181,5,B000A6T2BM,"In this action-packed superhero movie, we follow the adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl through the dreams of Max. Max represents the typical child, dreaming up a world of his own, only understood by himself. He has a dream journal filled with the stories of Sharkboy and Lavagirl on Planet Drool, but once his enemy, Linus (Minus in Planet Drool), starts to destroy the pages, he must save the planet from becoming dark. This movie helps to teach kids and even adults the importance of dreaming and to not let anyone stop you from doing what you believe in. Through character representation, Robert Rodriguez creates a movie that brings out the kid in everyone.
 The characters in the movie are represented specifically to be more relatable to a variety of children. Max represents children with crazy imaginations and that are able to dream up anything they want. People are constantly telling him that his dreams are not real, but he never gives up on them. He is able to save the imaginations of the students and adults in this movie. Sharkboy represents a child who was forced to grow up without the influence of his parents. This shows his independence and need for power; this is why he wants to be king of the ocean. His ability to get gills and grow fins shows that he is able to adapt to his new environment without being under the influence of parents. Sharkboy wears a tight blue suit, allowing his fast speed to easily be used in flexible clothing. The thinness of the suit is a key point to notice because he has to keep cool as much as possible since he is half shark. He also has sharp teeth, gills, and fins to help him adapt to the lifestyle underwater. These give him the ability to travel between two different worlds, land and water. Max dreamt him up to represent his desire to travel between two worlds, the real one and Planet Drool. Lavagirl represents a child that does not know their purpose for living. She wears a heavy suit to help keep her insulated to make sure her fire does not burn out. She has lava running through her veins, just like a volcano. Her pink hair/body shows her flaming nature and ability to stand out. Throughout the movie, she is trying to find her identity because she knows that there is good inside of her somewhere. Lavagirl does not understand why Max dreamt her the way she is, but in the end, she realizes that she represents the light in the world. She is not just fire and lava, but she is light, symbolizing positivity. Max dreams her up this way because he does not feel like he fits in this world, but in the end, realizes where he belongs. He is king of the dream world just like she is the ruler of the fire world. Between Sharkboy and her, she is the one that is always looking at the good in every situation. Sharkboy and Lavagirl also help to show that opposites really do attract. Their powers are so different from one another that they make the perfect team.
This idea of opposites attracting is also shown in Maxs parents. Even though they constantly are fighting, in the end, they realize that they need each other in their lives. In the beginning of the movie, they have conflicting views on whether Max should be able to dream or not. Maxs mom feels that kids need to learn to grow up, while the dad takes the perspective that kids need their dreams. In the end, they both agree that Max needs to dream in order to enjoy his childhood. Linus represents a child who does not have an imagination like other children. He does not have the ability to dream like Max, so instead of accepting that he cant, he puts him down. In Planet Drool, he is known as minus (we can assume because of his negativity), but in the end, he is sketching a picture in his notebook of being Mr. Positive. Max was able to change his perspective on the dream world. The final notable character is Mr. Electricidad, also known as Mr. Electric. He is one big computer screen for his head with electricity as his arms and legs. The idea of him being made out of electricity is symbolic. He is sucking the dreams out of kids, just like electricity sucks power out of things. He represents the adults of the world trying to destroy the dreams of kids. Mr. Electricidad also represents the typical adults in the world that do not understand the minds of children. He does not understand the imagination in Max and when his daughter, Marissa, comes up with Ice Girl and Dream Boy, he shoots it down right away. In the end, he thanks Max for showing him his inner child. The character choices in this movie are important to understand because they help to make the movie more relatable to children and adults. In the end, all of the characters come to the realization that dreams are important and can become anything you want them to become.
 There are specific scenes in the movie that are important to point out in order to understand the directors purpose behind the movie. A subtle, yet significant point in the beginning of the movie is when Lavagirl tells us, the audience, to put on our 3D glasses. She says that the girls wear the pink ones and boys wear blue, but when Max wears the pink, it shows kids that they can wear whatever color they want to wear, no matter what gender they are. Another thing to pick up on in the movie is that Planet Drool is laid out like a brain: passage of time, train of thought, stream of consciousness, and the sea of confusion. Since Planet Drool is based off of dreams, the director made it seem like the different areas of the brain that get in the way before dreaming can occur. The last notable scene in the movie is the land of milk and cookies. The land of milk and cookies is something that the typical child would dream: a river of milk and giant cookies used as boats. This is the only place on Planet Drool where sweet dreams can occur. Once Max is able to lie down and try to dream, the cookie giants interrupt him. The cookie giants resemble his parents, taking the cookie from him and destroying his dreams. This is symbolic because parents are always trying to stop their kids from eating sweets and they want their kids to grow up. Even though these are only some of the scenes that are shown in the movie, they help to show that if you look into a scene deeper, you are able to see the hidden meanings. This also helps to show that the imagination of a child really does run wild and that they can dream up anything that they want to.
 The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is not usually viewed as the typical superhero movie, but there is definitely the aspect of a superhero seen in Max. He helps all of his classmates and even the adults believe that if you dream something, it can come true. This movie has an important lesson for both children and adults. It teaches children that they should never give up on their dreams, no matter how many people are against them. It teaches adults that dreaming is a part of growing up and they should not get in the way of a childs dreams. This movie is perfect for all ages and it was an enjoyable movie to watch. As Lavagirl says, everything that is or was, began with a dream.",1446595200,,7129,4.436308161708619
2371182,4,B000A6T2BM,"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl is not just a childrens movie. It is a movie that teaches you to stick to your dreams and if you follow them, something remarkable with happen. This is exactly what Max, and main character, does in the film. Throughout the film many things stood out, details that a child watching this movie would not catch. Aspects such as different genres, symbolism and mere detail like clothing stood out, telling a story of its own.
On the outside this film is a superhero movie. From the special powers exhibited from Shark Boy and Lava Girl throughout the movie, to the presence of an enemy, and a problem that needs to be solved, the story embodied something all super hero movies must have. This movie could also be considered a spy movie though. If you took out the super hero aspect of having super powers, the movie is all about searching for Maxs dream journal, and ultimately trying to find out who Shark Boy and Lava Girl truly were. It could also be a fantasy movie. If you focus on the movie when they are in Planet Drool, it could easily be considered a fantasy movie. It was unrealistic, with ice princesses, Mr. Electric, an enemy who had a screen for a head, electrical plugs that moved and other features that made this eligible to be categorized as fantasy. With the presence of many different genres it makes the movie that much more relatable to a wide variety of audiences.
The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl was not the only superhero movie that director Robert Rodriguez made. He has made multiple movies, many of which have a sense of super power, extraterrestrial life, or spy element woven into it. He was a producer for The Spy Kids series, Predator, a movie about aliens, and Planet Terror, which focuses on zombie like creatures. It makes a lot of sense that with his knowledge of many different genres, that a lot of them would be tied up into one movie with The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl.
The movie starts off with a quote, Everything that is or was began with a dream quoted by Lava Girl. This is before any graphics were shown, and it is meant to imprint the word dreams into your mind. Maxs story starts off like that of many 4th graders. He is having some trouble in school due to the kids in his class. The class actually started throwing things at him. In the film this connects to Max being an outcast. This alone is the reason he is so fascinated in dreams, and why his are so intense. The only girl who did not throw something at him was a girl named Marisa. She was wearing all white showing that she was pure, and had created a drawing of an ice princess wearing a crystal necklace in her own journal, just like Max had done in his dream journal. She ends up being the ice princes in his dream and that necklace will be something that helps Max save Planet Drool. The crystal necklace foreshadowed the solution to a problem Max faced. This is the first time that dreams came up in the film, though it certainly would not be the last.
The story line is based on dreams and Maxs imagination. He talks about a young boy who was inevitably separated from his father, and raised by sharks. He will be known as Shark Boy. Before he gets separated, the wet suit the human boy was wearing had a small image of a shark fin, and fire on it. This was foreshadowing of Shark Boy and Lava Girl coming together as a team. Most people wouldnt pair fire and a shark fin together. Shark boys wet suit had the two barely touching, but shown together in harmony. This shows the relationship they will have. While annoying one another all the time, they were put together for a reason and will eventually understand why. They are very different, with very different powers, but needed each other to succeed. Also, details such as the villain being the boy, Linus, who was mean to Max in school is something that takes a lot of meaning in its self. The day that Max entered Planet Drool was the same day that Linus had taken his dream journal. Maxs teacher had hinted at the fact that these two boys have had problems before, and that he didn't want them carrying this into the new year. The first time Max saw Linus, also known as Minus on Planet drool, he had his back towards Max and you could not see his face. This shows that he is still stuck in the past. He was not willing to resolve his problems with Max and focus on the future, but instead he wants to stay in the past.
Max was a special boy, he believed in his dreams and felt like his dream was where he was the happiest. he kept a journal for that reason, so he could always go back to them. When his parents were fighting, or he was having trouble at school, he could relive his happy moments, or what were his happy moments. Unfortunately, Max hates school. He doesnt fit in and they make fun of him. Its very ironic how the school is right outside of his door step. He is confronted with his biggest problem face to face every single day. He can never escape it. Max sits in class and can see his home, another place he dreads being at. Even on the weekends when he doesnt have school he has to see it, and remind himself about going back on Monday. Max had no way to escape his fears, they even showed up in his dreams, which he thought was his one safe place. The night before Shark Boy and Lava Girl showed up to Maxs house he was fussing with the electrical plugs. He exclaimed how they never worked and were always causing problems. When Max got to Planet Drool the electrical plugs were there. They were dangerous and out to hurt max. the plugs were all different colors. They were there to represent all the emotions that Max has felt in his everyday life that gets brought into his dreams. Ranging from yellow, green and black the colors represent every emotion and feeling that make up Maxs dreams. The fact that Mr. Electric was a villain in his dream, and his teacher in real life shows an unhealthy connection between the two also. Mr. Electricidad had a TV screen as a head. This could be trying to show that he is a figure head, with no real power. He has a title, but behind the screen he is no one. Mr. Electricidad tried his best to be evil. He was constantly acting mean, but always was answering to a higher power. This is the perception Max got from his teacher in real life. He demanded respect and cooperation from people who did not react to him.
The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl incorporated colors into each character. Shark boy, a character who was very bitter from the beginning was in gray and black. Both somber colors, which signifies the loss of his dad, and the anger he still felt. Lava Girl was pink, and orange. The orange signified her power, and the pink shows her love, and that was all she knew about her self. She didn't know who she was, or why she was the way she was. She constantly was searching for herself and that was her top priority throughout this journey. Mr. Electricidad was purple and green. Green stands for envy, something that connects thoroughly to his character. With the constant need to be an authoritarian, and getting shut down, he was envious of those that could command a room. Purple normally stands for power and nobility, something he very much craves. The scene where Linus is trying to get Maxs journal, all the mean boys ganging up on Max were wearing something red. Red signifies blood. They were going to do whatever it took to get that journal, even if it meant hurting him. Also, all of these boys must have some sort of bad blood in their pasts. They are being mean for a reason, something in their past must have triggered them to be this way. Colors brings out a lot in a character, either by what they are wearing or the color that surrounds them when they show up scene from scene.
This film is one that could be looked at as one that is just like any normal childrens film on the surface. If you go deeper down, you see that it much more than that. Detail is focused on a lot during this movie, something that could go unnoticed. Things like different genres, colors and people were used throughout the movie to symbolize different things. In the end everything seemed to work out for Max. He came out of this story a happier boy and throughout his journey he helped his parents, Lava Girl and himself find what really mattered to them personally. The different ways these things were portrayed in the movie, either through color, genre, or clothing made it that much more interesting. While on the surface this is a childrens superhero movie about dreams, once you go in depth you see what the movie is truly trying to portray. The quote in the beginning of the film comes full circle, and you realize the importance of an imagination and dreams, even when everyone else tells you otherwise.",1446508800,,8820,4.408338442673206

Ours really enjoyed it I think because they related so easily to the themes: dealing with a bully at school, escape into a dream world, parents who love you but have tough stuff to deal with too.

Special effects are weird at times. The 3D seemed a bit lame but the story line was really good enough that the film didn't need to be CGd as much. It moved at a good pace, was imaginative and ended happily-yeah! Everyone finds their place in the world, including SB and LG, both of whom mature into responsible superheroes. If nothing else watch it for the cast; many of these kids are stars now!

I know it's a kids movie (I watched it so many times because my 6 year old loves it), but there's a certain bit of quality that we SHOULD be able to expect from a kids movie. Unfortunately, none of that is present in this movie. The premise is great, and works well for a kids movie. But the overall story and execution are, simply put, terrible. Even if the special effects are cheesy by intent (and hoo boy, they are something else), the rest of the movies failings just make that add to the pile. And it's a big pile. When your primary on-screen talent are George Lopez, Kristin Davis (who I actually generally like, despite her tenure on Sex and the City), and Courteney Cox's husband, you've got the makings for a pretty epic stinker, which this so very much is.

2372681,5,B000A6T2BM,"Watching this on Amazon Instant felt like I was a back in the dayo as a little kid again, sitting in the theater watching Spy Kids 3D.
A magical moment around every bend. From when you meet Max, the painfully likable lead character, to Sharkboy, the charming and HANDSOME young male heartthrob, and Lavagirl, the lonely hearts club band so to speak. Each character is a lost soul, kinda just like me and you. Really relatable. Even though they have superpowers they have real life problems too. For example, Lavagirl experiences a crippling identity crisis throughout the film, Sharkboy watched his father drown, and Max's teacher is George Lopez.

George Lopez' performance is truly unlike any other George Lopez performance I've ever seen. I was shocked and touched to discover upon reading the end credits that he voiced and played several characters, including the teacher AND the evil Mr. Electric. Say what you will but the man has range. His best film BY FAR (maybe tied with Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3: Viva La Fiesta).

I highly recommend this movie. If you don't like it, it means you don't have a heart, a soul, or children.

In closing, to quote the films perhaps wisest and most insightful character:

""Everything that is or was, began with a dream...""

Taylor lautner went on to become a huge star, while the always beatiful lava girl did not.

We've already watched it (that's the only way to find out that it's 3-D), so we can't return it.  Really disappointed with the lack of disclosure.

I got this for my 4 yr old granddaughter after we watched it on the Disney channel because she loved it.

2-D is fine and a bit more brilliant in color which is great for kids and the storyline.

2372834,5,B000A6T2BM,"First of all this is a fantasy in the tradition of Wizard of Oz, Never Ending Story &  Alice in Wonderland. Its a story about a journey in the mind of a child trying to deal with his life. He goes inside his own mind (in a very creative way ) to deal with his inner world and is encouraged to 'dream awake' and make his outer world the way he wants by changing his perspective. Those are concepts worth thinking about at any age.
 With vivid visuals of following the 'train of thought' , floating down the 'stream of consciousness' and not to mention the brain storm of real brains , its very  clever, especially compared to the old ' follow the yellow brick road & 'if I only had a brain'which adults have been watching for generations.

It's quite fantastical with oer-the-top special effects, almost garishly so like many of Douglas Rodrigez-directed movies are, but works because of the outlandish conceit.  A boy wrote a story, based on dreams that he reads to the class for a writing project.  He is ridiculed for it and the adventure begins.  The predominant themes are similar to other children's movies: believe in yourself and you will be rewarded, the hero has undiscovered talents that make him indispensible, a semi-surprise villian mastermind that turns out to be misunderstood, the hero has to save the day wihout use of his special talent but something that all children are capable of, etc.  The kids are endlessly enthralled by the story and I'm sure will watch it repeatedly for years to come.",1369785600,,866,4.824324324324325

2373218,5,B000A6T2BM,"I caught this movie a few times on the Disney Channel, and I thought the whole plot was clever and appropriate for kids.  It does not make a lot of sense, but that is the whole point, isn't it?  Dreams are not supposed to be sensible, but the story itself propels through out the film.  Thus, creating an adventure where kids discover what really goes inside their minds at night.

Now, for the acting.  George Lopez is hilarious as he is in many of his films, and him as an electric outlet to match his name was nearly genius.  He makes me laugh nearly all the time, and I thought he pushed his comidian persona a little bit farther in this.  That is what gave the film its spark.

Taylor Lautner:  First major film role, and he definately nailed it as Sharkboy.  He is funny, and a little mean, but that is what made it good.  The thing that I observed about Lautner in this is that he is suppoosed to be ten in the film, but I can tell that he is maturing, and looks older then what he is supposed to be.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed him play the part.

Camdyn Boyd:  I have to admit that although he is a cute kid(I meant that in a obsevation sense, not the other way), he was kind of annoying to me in the film.  Usually got on the friends nerves, but how he came up with the whole dream sequencw is really smart.  I just wish he did less whining, then it would have been better.

Taylor Dooley:  She is very pretty, but like Lautner, looks older then the part.  She played the role of Lavagirl quite well, and her ability to show the right emotions ruled out. However, she and Lautner worked really well together, and hope that erases the 'icky' thought of a boy having a girl best friend.

So, if you want to have a fun family movie night, this one should be a plus.  Lots of action, but no violence, and fits most age gaps.",1326326400,2,1826,4.174785100286533

She was renting it so much I finally picked it up on here for her.  And the adventures don't stop on tv, oh no!  Like any great movie, they inspire her imagination!  And Ella has Sharkboy and Lava Girl over quite regularly, let me tell you!  But to the movie itself, it is full of childhood imagination (a dying breed), dreaming, and the special effects are out of this world (literally!)  I love all the color in this film and the plot is fun and not too scary either.  Ella loves reacting it out over and over and over again.  Can't have been too bad if Taylor Lautner got his first big break from this one to go on to play Jacob Black!  Highly Recommended!",1313280000,,774,4.168918918918919

2373285,5,B000A6T2BM,"A friend lent us this film with a 'must watch' recommendation and my 4,6 and 8 year old absolutely loved it. We had to buy our own version in the end as after 2 weeks they still didn't want to give it back. It's up there in their favourite top 3 films ever. It's one of those films you'll watch time and time again and it's interesting enough for adults to sit through.

It is visually stunning. The bright colours and action of the computer generated scenes are way different to anything I've seen before and the story of a young boy struggling with all the day to day problems associated with parents, school, bullies, teachers etc will hit a cord with any primary school age child.

This 3D version comes with 2 pairs of pink glasses and 2 pairs of blue glasses. They are the standard flimsy cardboard type but in the film the boy hero gets to wear the pink ones too so my children loved joining in. In the 3D version you do not need to wear the glasses all the time. There are 'glasses on' and 'glasses off' messages on the screen. It is mainly in the fantasy scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl they need to be worn. The fantasy aspect of the film really utilises the 3D glasses. Lava rocks coming towards you etc.

There normal film version without the 3D is also available on this disk and now the novelty of the glasses has worn off this is the version my childen watch most.

The characters in this film are really cool and modern. In many ways this is like an ultra modern updated 'Never Ending Story' film. There is some clever dialogue and it is a superb riot of imagination let loose on the screen. If you are a daydreamer or have kids with fantastic imaginations buy this, you won't be disappointed.

This is absolutely a must see film for children.",1300665600,,1761,4.3567073170731705

While it is a bit cheesy, the whole point is to suspend one's belief long enough to experience the wonder for the POSSIBILITY of dreams becoming reality! That is why children love movies so much and why we as adults should enjoy watching these movies with them.  ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" takes me back to my own time of childish wonder, watching the equally cheesy Sinbad movies at the local theatre, eating popcorn with friends and running home pretending to be the various characters in the movie. If you and your kids enjoy snuggling up on the sofa together whilst enjoying an evening of make-believe, then this is the DVD for you! However, I'd stick to the 2-D version...",1298419200,,784,4.633093525179856
2373289,5,B000A6T2BM,"The movie is good for what it is, if you enjoy Spykids and Shorts you'll enjoy this. What i'm really reviewing is the 3d. I never knew they had DVDs that showed 3D in stereoscopic. I hated anaglyph 3D, i just couldn't enjoy 3d movies that way. This will work with the latest 3d bluray players and 3d tvs that can handle side by side 3D.

Of course playing this on a 3D HDTV there's a slight resolution degradation when upscaling in addition to the horizontal resolution loss with side by side 3d format. Overall it looks ok and doesn't distract you from the movie or the 3D, which works just as good as 3D bluray movies. its basically the same 3d experience as the theater but at a lower resolution. I think this disc is worth it for any person that enjoys watching 3d movies plus its rare availability makes it a great collectors find. Who knows if they'll release this movie on 3D bluray but here's an option until that happens and im glad they have it.",1297987200,,955,4.335195530726257

2373358,3,B000A6T2BM,"Two questions came to mind in watching ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" (only in 2D).  One, how did Taylor Lautner went from lil' shrimp to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/big-and-beefy/dp/B002ZZ1IC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">big and beefy</a>&nbsp;in three years?  Two, why is Mr. ""Desperado"" Rodriguez continuing to make films meant sorely for his tikes, nevermind this movie being based on the director's kid's stories?  None of his children films represent the director at his best, and his recent ones went fancy with the 3D technology.  I don't like his approach to 3D, which the stuff he throws at the audience's face are blatantly forward and they're not well-done; I'm also astound by how gaudy the background and CGI effects of his latest kids' films are.  I can forgive that in ""Spy Kids 3-D"" since the low-quality CGI of that movie captured the look of a modern-age, fun-for-all gaming world it's going for, but here, not so much.  The visuals in ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" are so distracting, it pushed me away from the movie.

Much of the look has been made by the dreams of a kid named Max.  He got picked on because he tend to confuse dreams with reality in his show-and-tells, and his family didn't approved his warped view of reality.  But then one night he dreamed of a world he wanted to escape, and the next day his dream became a reality when the titular characters crashed into his school class and took him to Planet Drool, where he must stop a great evil from shutting down the planet and ridding the world of dreams.  The world is just one, big, green-screen effect and the kids are just going from point A to point B.  I won't complain about the movie lacking in imagination (heck, the spark plug monsters were creative), but I will complain about a certain character in the film: Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley) and her incessant smile.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/As-I-mentioned-before/dp/B002U1LGTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">As I mentioned before</a>, characters who almost always smile chill down my spine, and Dooley's character does it so frequently and in a very picturesque way.  She's not as creepy in smiling as Nia Vardalos, but it's nevertheless felt unnatural.

There are films that cater to both adults and kids, and this movie isn't one of them.  It's strongly meant for kids, considering the name 'Planet Drool', a land of milk & cookies, girls and boys wearing specifically in gender-preferred colors, and how the adults of the film talk immaturely.  The movie's too childish to reach the child within me.  I'm sure kids themselves are gonna enjoy this for the colorful adventure, so I'm willing to call this a decent timewaste, though I won't be surprised if the kids grow out of this film once they hit puberty.",1280275200,,2848,5.212719298245614

A difficult to find it in your local department store, but finding a copy was simple here on Amazon.

My advise to parents, don't expect a whole lot from the movie. It was directed with children in mind afterall. Yes, the acting could have been better, but that is part of the appeal. The whole cheekiness of the characters made if fun. This is one movie where the adults were the secondary characters and the children were the main. (compared so say, Spy Kids)

I sat through the special effects, the bad acting, the thin as a credit card plot, etc.  And, when the movie was over I said ""Well, that was interesting.""  That's all I could say!  It was like some other reviewers' said, Rodriquez got carte blanc to do whatever he wanted to do, he wanted to do a 3D movie and the studio was like ""Do whatever you want.""  It's kind of sad when Spy Kids was such a great movie and then, he unloads this piece of crap on his fans.  He took a serious risk as, in the past, I would have seen anything with Rodriquez' name attached to it, but now, I'll definately be hesitating.  I feel like I lost 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back and if I had gone to bed, I probalby could have dreamed a better dream than Rodriquez or anyone associated with this film ever could!  Also, while I know they're just children, the acting was horrible and very wooden.  However, since the movies was about dreams, I guess it's okay that half of the cast was in a coma!  As far as George Lopez, I liked him because he always talked about how Latinos don't get that many parts in Hollywood, yada, yeda yada.  But I have to question how much he's advancing Latino actors when it seems as though he'll accept ANY part that's handed to him!  Kirsten Davis was definatly wasted as well as David Arquette. I know they want to ""graduate"" from the small screen to the big screen, but this was like going from high school to community college when you could have waited for ivy league!

Before anyone graduates high school this movie must be watched. It's as important to a high school student as red asphalt is to a student driver... The moral of this story is, if you have no talent, and no ambition. And a movie studio is pressuring you to make a good movie, just relax and let your talentless son write, and direct it.

Parts of the movie are very difficult to follow, but Lavagirl and Sharkboy are appealing in their strangeness and the relationships of the main character Max to characters in his 'real life' vs. 'dream world' interesting.  There are obviously very contrived moments, especially at the end, when the whole movie comes together in a neat package, but it is a kid's movie after all.

When Sharkboy and Lavagirl come to ask for Max's help to save the planet he created and their home, planet drool will Max be able to help? Especially since his dream journal has been stolen by the class bully Linus(Jacob Davich).

The dvd does not come with the 3d glasses, atleast mine didn't, but you can watch it in 2d as well which is just as enjoyable. (And doesn't leave you with a headache!)

All the child actors are enjoyable and the plot is fun, filled with plays on words and different takes on famous children's rhymes and analogies.

George Lopez is entertaining as the intimidating Mr. Electric,  an evil villain on planet drool and Max's school teacher back home on planet earth.

I also really enjoyed the making of feature that tells us a lot about Robert Rodriguez's processes in creating and really bringing Sharkboy and Lavagirl to life. It's admirable to see someone really helping to cultivate their children's creative side, especially when there is such opportunity.

2373474,4,B000A6T2BM,"Let me begin by saying that as a rule, I don't usually support movies that portray kids in the savior role.  I object to this mainly because I believe we, as a society, have elevated kids above their status by our constant portrayal of children as wiser, smarter and more cleaver than adults.  By letting them constantly view children in this role, is it any wonder that so many kids have no respect for adults.  I realize there are some adults that are not worthy of any respect... but now I am wandering off topic.  Although Sharkboy and LavaGirl's hero is a small boy, he still remains respectful of adults in the real world.  This is why I fully support this film.

As a child I was the ultimate ""Day Dreamer"" (Max's title on the Dream World).  I walked around in my own little world most of the time.  As a result I was called numerous unflattering names: Dingbat, AirHead and Breezy, just name a few.  This resulted in a low self-esteem that took years to overcome.  Max helps us see that an imagination may be something that will come in handy and may even be something to be admired even though many see it as an excuse for name calling.

 The only thing that keeps this from being a Five Star is that in the end the kid is the only one smart enough to save the world: once again adults are portrayed as incapable, but at least the kid still remains respectful to authority figures.",1211846400,6,1390,4.365758754863813

We saw this movie when it came out in the theaters, and have rented it a few times. I decided to purchase it for his PSP becasue it will be a good one for him to watch while traveling this summer.

The story line is pretty straight forward, and the acting is nothing to write home about, but he seems to like to watch it over and over agian. So as far as a movie for the young ones goes it is pretty good.",1180224000,,502,3.8737864077669903

2373509,5,B000A6T2BM,"Sharkboy and Lavagirl is like a painting without 3D glasses. Put on the glasses and you experience a magical reality where dreams change your world and where the challenge is to overcome the nightmares.

This movie is as much about facing fears and positive thinking as it is about special effects. It is especially impressive in this regard, with witty dialogue and spontaneous and unexpected turns of event.

I found Lavagirl to be a beautiful character with a loving heart and playful outlook on life. She sometimes forgets her powers and they use this for comic effect. She seems a little lost at first, as if seeking her greater purpose all while enjoying a playful combative interchange with Sharkboy.

The scenes take place in a school and in a magical dream reality. The characters move from real life to dreams in an instant and you can fall asleep and dream up a new reality in your dreams. It is all very fun and I found myself laughing throughout at the innocent humor and creative surprises. I think adults will get the ""brainstorm"" joke even more than children would and there is plenty of humor for adults and kids to enjoy. I also thought there were some amazingly profound moments during the conversations and if you realize what it would take to say those lines to someone who is a bully, that in itself should impress.

On the fun visual side, lands of cookies and milk present culinary adventures as Lavagirl, Sharkboy and Daydreamer Max float through a world on a huge chocolate chip cookie. Then you have a volcano and worlds of imagination reminiscent of a theme park ride. There is a mildy dark nemesis who is the bully and he aggravates the situation by appearing in Max's dreams. He steals Max's diary. I loved that Max had a dream journal and how reading through the journal/diary made his dreams come true. Changing the dreams, changed the settings and this presents the challenge.

The amazing thing about this movie is how it was inspired by a child's imagination and when you watch the extras, I think you will be even more impressed. I would love to see more movies like this because it reminds me of the hope we have as children and how we can still dream our worlds into life as adults. I think this movie gives children an empowering message and to be honest, some of the issues discussed in this movie could change a child's world for the better. Max is a great role model and his actions speak of a wisdom far beyond his years. As Max learns to navigate his own imagination, he is really teaching children amazing lessons about how to navigate life.

Highly Recommended along with the 3D glasses!

2373543,5,B000A6T2BM,"This movie is a FABULOUS movie to watch if you have an intelligent child who is being teased/bullied at school.  In the movie - sharkboy and lavagirl represent the two 'inner minds' of the main character: lavagirl is intelligence, sharkboy is anger/resentment.  If you watch it on this level - the movie makes absolute sense...the kid is being teased about being smart and having a vivid imagination.  The kid has to decide if he'll ""pretend"" not to be smart (i.e. lose lavagirl) and just turn wild and angry (i.e. make sharkboy the hero) in order to fit in.  The teacher unwittingly terrifies the kid (he represents all adults who make little offhand remarks that cause deep scars) and becomes a monster in ""drool"" land.  When they go to the land of ""milk and honey"" (i.e. where everything's good) - the only dreams that work out are the ones that aren't selfish - those that are wished upon others.  In the end, we find the bully bullies not because he's against the kid, but because he has his own issues.  WOW!

Moral: You can't just 'dream away'your problems, but you can get some perspective on who you are and how others are and learn to live in the real world with all it's foibles.

OK: please do keep in mind that it is a ""crappy"" film if you don't watch it at this level - but REALLY - if you see it for the symbolism (and then use it as a springboard for discussion with your kids)...it's terrific!!!",1162425600,4,1412,4.463035019455253
2373544,5,B000A6T2BM,"This film is based on the heros journey,  which is a universal mythology found in all cultures.  All children are heros.  Aside from the struggle they have as they attempt to hold onto their imagination, which is the focus of this film, just going through the journey of being born is heroic.

The film takes you through the different aspects of the inner world of a boy named Max, the story's main character, who is attempting to hold onto his dreams in the face of a culture that favors collective conformity over individual creativity.  All mythologies originate from the body. Sharkboy and Lavagirl represent the sacral and solar plexus, respectively. Like most of us, Lavagirl is trying to discover who she is.  Being fire, she is that part of the body that 'destroys every thing it touches.'  She asks, who am I?  Am I evil?  Am I bad?  Finally, when her true powers are revealed she is told, ""you are light.""  The three journey together to see the Princess who resides in the Crystal Palace located in the heart, for she possesses the diamond needed to cool the fearful aspect of an overheated nervous system appropriately named ""Mr. Electric.""

We were all dreamers once until socialization slowly took them away replacing them with the inflexible collective dream of our culture.  From my point of view, the message of this film is to explore the possiblity of children - as well as adults - to face their fears and recover their dreams from a belief system that does not encourage individuality.

Children are wise because they have not been filled with synthetic knowledge.  With the wisdom that originates from the physical body, most children will recognise the powerful themes of this film on an intuitive level.  If you are an adult and you also recognise them you are lucky.",1161907200,2,1790,4.762987012987013

Dreaming is a very bizarre and peculiar phenomenon, so I think the pure imagination depicted in the film is justified.

I own the other versions of this movie, too. But, I like this one the best, because the 3-D is sharp and colors are stunning.

Honestly, this is one of those few times when a movie is much better looking on DVD than it was in the theaters.

This movie played in theaters in Anaglyph format (red/cyan 3-D glasses), which distorted the colors and lessened the 3-D effect. I'd give it a bad review in the theaters. The other DVD release of this movie was also Red/Cyan 3-D. But, this particular DVD release is HQFS (High Quality Field Sequential), a MUCH better 3-D format .

You need a 3-D viewing system (like ASIN: B00005QW5S ) to watch it. (LCS shutter glasses, not red/blue glasses.)

One last important note: The description says this DVD is in Full Screen (not Wide Screen). Truth is that it actually is some form of wide screen. It is not as cropped as a real Full Screen disc. If played in full screen mode, characters are slightly thinner than usual. When I put my system in Wide Screen mode, this DVD it looks more correct. There is one viewing wide screen resize mode of my system in which it looks perfect. Normally, I wouldn't buy a DVD unless it is labelled Wide Screen, but this DVD is an exception.

Certainly, if you love 3-D and haven't seen this movie in the theaters, then I'd recommend this DVD. I saw this movie in the theaters (and didn't like it). But, I am much more fond of it on this DVD. I'd give it a 3 for story. but a 4 for 3-D.",1148774400,18,1596,4.250825082508251

Ironically, I didn't leave the theater after any of those movies, even ""Star Wars"", feeling as awestruck as I did after walking out of ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl.""

Wait!  I know what you're thinking.  ""I'd rather see Batman or Star Wars or the Fantastic Four.""  By all means, see those movies.  You'll get your money's worth.  Just don't overlook this movie as being some stupid kiddie movie.  I went to see it with my little brother, and I was glad I did.

Of course, the thing that distinguishes this movie from all the other summer films is the 3D part.  Only the genius of Robert Rodriguez could resurrect 3D movie.  When they were first invented, the 3D was to impress adults, and the plots were preposterous in order to accommodate objects hurtling out of the screen.  It makes more sense to have a 3D kid's movie, where a preposterous plot is acceptable and where you'd expect random objects to fly at you.  The 3D element is even better this time than in Rodriguez's last attempt, ""Spy Kids 3D.""  The scenes seem to have actual depth and width and, from aerial shots, height.  The 3D becomes more and more impressive as the movie progresses.  All of the really good effects, those where you'd swear the object was actually floating just a couple of rows in front of you, are saved until the end.

The movie also gives you more to think about than most summer movies, even without the 3D element.  There's a Freudian theme about what causes dreams and how fantasy can affect reality.  There's also a few messages about growing up kids can take home with them (along with their 3D glasses.)

The movie has a lot in common with ""Spy Kids 3D.""  There's a 3D prologue, a 2D introduction to the characters, a 3D alternate dimension that a child travels to, and a 3D villain that makes his way into the 2D world for a final showdown.  This time, the villain becomes 2-dimensional in the 2D world, but it feels like you're still experiencing depth and width even after you take your 3D glasses off.  ""Spy Kids 3D"" had Sylvester Stallone in multiple roles.  ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" has George Lopez, who may lack the star power but not the talent.  In his different roles he portrays alternately warmth, cold, villainy, and wisdom.",1140220800,6,2375,4.595238095238095
2373594,2,B000A6T2BM,"Robert Rodriguez, definitely brilliant film director, proves with this terribly empty `Sharkboy and Lavagirl' that we need something better than CGI to make a film that deserves the name of film. `The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl' would only offer the cheap 3D images that would make you dizzy, and floundering in confusion, almost meaningless sequences that go on like your nightmare last night.

We don't need summery of the plot for there is none. Like the third `Spy Kids' film, it looks like watching video games someone else is doing from behind. The only difference is that you cannot control the characters you are watching.

Well, but actually, there is a story first suggested by Rodriguez's then seven-year son.  In short, young timid boy Max, always daydreaming about superhero/heroine -- Sharkboy and Lavagirl -- is tormented by his teacher and is bullied by some of the classmates. But suddenly these two fictional characters arrive in the real world, and tell Max that their home Planet Drool is in danger.

So far the film fares well. But on the Planet the story gets suddenly weaker, and becomes confusing at times. The three kids keep traveling on the planet, sometimes on a huge cookie floating on the milk, sometimes chased by a minion of the Darkness (George Lopez), or sometimes attacked by electric eels. Everything happens here in a very whimsical fashion, and I finally couldn't understand why they have to roam so long.

[3D... DO WE NEED IT?] Yes, I know. We cannot expect IMAX theater from this red-and-blue glasses, but unlike in `The Spy Kids: Game Over' we have to sit through the film's 3D part very long. After the second on-screen instruction `GLASSES ON,' the 3D section on Planet Drool goes on and on, never stopping for us to have a rest (probably about 3/4 of the film is shot in 3D). After staring at the screen so long, tears started to gather in my eyes. Is this only me?

Perhaps the pictures of the fantasy world look better in the all-2D version, but not having seen it, I cannot tell. The only thing I can add here is this, well, it is a bit cruel to say this, but it is about the acting. Unlike his pal Quentin Tarantino (who single-handedly revamped the career of Travolta and made Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman international stars), Rodriguez has never been famous for extracting the best performances from the actors in his films. Yes, his films are fun to see, but we don't see his films for acting. But in `Sharkboy and Lavagirl' things get worse than before. The four kids are rather dull, George Lopez is over-the-top, and about the cameos from David Arquette and Kristen Davis, all I can say is that they are decent actors, and need decent characters or dialogues to do.

I like Rodriguez's playful style, and really love three `The Spy Kids' films, especially the first one that is still one of my favorite family pictures, but I couldn't love this one. And we often write like `Kids would love this.' Yes, they do, (and I too often write that way, I admit), but probably the kids who love this film would love any `Spy Kids' films or animations from Pixar.",1140220800,,3117,4.677007299270073

Basically the main thread of this film is a knock off of a far superior older kids film called THE NEVER ENDING STORY which I enjoyed very much. The rest is pure Hollywood PC tripe written with a Manual and is by far the weakest of the Rodriquez family series. One major fault of the movie is that the child actors who have to carry this are just so-so in their chops. No Dakota Fannings or Drew Barrymore's here. The other big let down is that script is so busy with it's moral that the characters are just left flat and uninteresting and very humorless. The real kids viewing this were a lot funnier than the ones on screen. Adventure should have a few laughs to tone down the tension. I may be fifty two but I'm a big kid myself and really enjoyed CHICKN LITTLE 3D but this was a snore with the exception of the best red and blue 3D process so far. Very young or undemanding kids may go for it but the 12 year old I showed it to recently for the 3D was begging me to shut it off and play Monty Python instead.

I liked it.

Yep: I thought it was good.  I thought it was better than most contemporary children's movies.  Why?

1) Sharkboy and Lavagirl have depth.  No, seriously, as superheroes go, they take the angst of the Spiderman movies and adapt it well for a younger crowd.

2) It's theme of imagination makes a perfect fall-back.  So it seems the movie goes in a stupid direction, huh?  Unfortunately I remember my childlike imagination going in that direction as well when I was that age.  In fact, almost all of the stuff shown, right down to the ending, fit perfectly the type of random stuff I'd come up with when I was a kid.  I related to it perfectly, and I'm usually the type of person who gets angry when a movie doesn't match the type of daydreaming imagination I had when I was little and spent all of my time walking around and around the playground, thinking of random child superheroes to have adventures with.

3)  At first the virtual reality world is, of course, too cartoony for real-world characters.  However, what ends up amazing is how well they interact in such a fake world.  It's seamless, and after a while I forgot how fake it was. Much more beloved and much more highly rated films have CGI/special effects worlds that it doesn't even look like the characters are moving in.  This one has them walking along in them as if they're really there.

4)  Rodriguez may not make the most artistic or original movies, but he knows what he's doing when streaming together a line of images.  Invisible editing and conscientious directing kept the story flowing pretty much as smoothly as the milk in the cookie land.  It was nice to see.

5)  I didn't get to watch it in 3-D, but it felt like it was in 3-D anyways.  GREAT cinematography.

So yeah.  Good movie.  Better than Spy Kids.

What probably sets people off are the ending scenes (barely, BARELY worked) and the first few scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl.  They're very discombobulating and the acting isn't exactly the best.  Finally, Linus/Minus isn't the best child actor I've ever seen, and his character wasn't as developed as it could have been.  These are the reasons people have a hard time getting caught in the rest of the movie.

I can't make other people like it, but I sure do.

2373621,4,B000A6T2BM,"Thanks to Sin City, I'm now a Robert Rodriguez fan, so I took advantage of my chance to give The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl a try.  I can't comment on the 3-D effects because I only saw the 2-D version.  I can say, however, that I really got a kick out of this movie.  I would have to disagree with those who say the story sort of loses traction in the final stages.  What you have to remember is that this story, as it is presented, is a story borne of a young boy's imagination.  It's just not in the spirit of things to go in expecting a completely logical ending to a story dreamed up by a fourth-grade kid.  I do agree that the main character's parents, played by David Arquette and Kristen Davis, are sort of flat, but I thought all of the other actors really came through pretty strongly.  OK, Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) could really get annoying at times, but that Lavagirl really lights up the screen; I fully expect to see Taylor Dooley flashing that winning smile of hers in many a film for years to come.  As for George Lopez (in a dual role), I thought he was great and played especially well to the target audience, which is, after all, youngsters (and us adults desperately trying to keep our inner child alive).

Max (Cayden Boyd) is pretty easy to identify with.  His parents bicker all the time, the other kids at school pick on him and make fun of him, and he's well on his way to developing a real ""why me?"" mentality.  His only escape from the real world comes in the form of his highly imaginative dreams.  It's all there in his dream journal - how he unexpectedly discovered Sharkboy while fishing, how Lavagirl appeared and took Sharkboy back with her to Planet Drool in order to help save the planet, and how he declined to go with them because, well, he had to go back to school.  It all makes for a great story, but Max doesn't win any friends by telling the story of Lavagirl and Sharkboy in the form of his ""what I did over the summer"" oral report.  The class bully steals his journal, and it starts to look like Max won't even have the escape valve of his elaborates dreams to get him through the coming days of ridicule and general unhappiness.

It's just about then that Sharkboy and Lavagirl show up unexpectedly, tell Max they need his help, and whisk him away to Planet Drool, where Mr. Electric and his power plug army are close to succeeding in bringing perpetual darkness to what should be the ultimate kids' playground of a planet.  That's when the adventure really begins, with many a wonderful setting brought to vivid, very colorful life on the screen.  Unfortunately for Max, he doesn't exactly know what to do to stop Mr. Electric (or the evil overseer who's really running the show).  He must reclaim his stolen dreams before ""remembering"" all of his unique powers.

In a way, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is sort of a modern variation on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as Planet Drool is a wonderland for the eyes.  There is plenty of action as the trio of heroes fight off the forces of darkness (although I'm not clear on who taught Sharkboy martial arts, seeing as how he was raised by sharks and all), there are numerous laughs to be had by children of all ages, and some actual life lessons are imparted by the time everything is said and done.  Imagination is important, especially for a child, but you have to work to make your dreams come true rather than merely use them as an escape; your enemies aren't so bad that you can't find a common ground with them; finding your purpose in life is integral to making you happy; etc.  To me, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl qualifies as a wonderfully entertaining family-friendly film that kids (and a fair share of adults) should really enjoy.",1134950400,5,3771,4.490483162518301

As I sat down to watch this movie with my daughter, we were both captivated (we did not see it in 3D).  The creativity that went into this film was amazing.

 I can honestly say it was enjoyable.  BTW - Shark Boy & Lava Girl were supposed to ""over-act"".  They were based on the superheros in Max's dream.  They reminded me of the way hero's acted in the 50's, it was refreshing to see actually.  Are we really so jaded as a society that we can't handle a little corny old fashioned super hero every now & then?  Think Buzz lightyear, also based on those old super heros!

Anyway, my daughter sat and watched the entire movie, and raved about it afterwards.  I think this one will be a classic, we are definately buying it.",1134345600,6,909,4.245614035087719

My daughter watched it once the first day, 4 times the 2nd day, once on the 3rd day (she ended up on a playdate or I am sure that it would have been several times that day as well) She watched another time during the week because school, homework, and a school performance got in the way.

2373660,1,B000A6T2BM,"Tonight I had the misfortune of seeing this movie. I can safely say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, possibly one of the worst ever made.

Here is a short summary of the story. A kid named max, who dreams too much. His parents hate each other.  His teacher, Mr. Electricidad gets mad at him for dreaming and doesn't like people talking to his daughter. The bratty antagonist ""Linus"" doesn't like Max and steals his ""Dream journal."" Max wishes he could go to a different world.  One day he dreams up Shark boy and Lava girl. They take him to his dream world a.k.a ""planet drool"" and he saves the day.

Ok, I've heard worse plots. But how do you turn this into a 93-minute movie. Well, the producers filled the story with thoughtless, unnecessary conversations that lasted too long and were irrelevant to the story, pitiful action scenes that consisted of fighting plugs, dance routines by Shark Boy that shouldn't be viewed if you are quick to nauseate, and futile attempts at comedy that consisted of say the word ""fart,"" over-exaggerated facial expressions, and dumb, mind-numbing antics that were about as humorous as a funeral. And what's the big, bad, evil plan that the bad guys have concocted? To make the planet ""Drool""... dark. Yes, the master plan is to make the place dark, and not let kids go to sleep and dream. I have eaten cafeteria food that was more evil. (No disrespect intended to cafeteria staff.) Finally, the scriptwriter should feel ashamed for writing this piece of crap. (I'm coming for your job man...)

The actors were, as a previous reviewer stated, poo. I have filmed home movies with greater acting talent. Shark Boy was always too tough and ready to beat someone up. Lava girl was always questioning whether she was light or evil. Max was always so helpless and childish. (George Lopez, I hope they paid you alot or else I don't see why you became affiliated with this crippity-crap.) George Lopez's two roles were probably the worse and most disappointing. His acting was shallow and over exaggerated.

Do I dare start on the special effects? First off, you could tell almost no work went into the effects. I almost laughed at the poor animation. I think the creators should have hired the studio janitor to do the effects instead.

Well, I was angry after seeing this movie, so I had to let out my frustration somehow. But SBALG deserves every harsh statement in this review. It is safe to say that I would rather be punched in the face than sit through the horror that is Shark Boy and Lava Girl.",1132185600,8,2536,4.634743875278397
2373661,2,B000A6T2BM,"Hello Earth, Hello Earth. This is 'Fool' from the Planet Drool. Can you hear me? Let me tell you about this movie. I basically dove into it expecting the comedy of George Lopez under the fine direction of Robert Rodriguez. It didn't happen however, due to the fact that the movie was artificially pumped up with trailer promises and later deflated by a script that was probably reworked from something Roger Corman threw away outside the studio.

To begin, am I the only person here on this planet who can see that the storyline is totally lifted from ""THE NEVERENDING STORY""? Note the following similarities between this movie and Wolfgang Petersen's work: 1) Problems at school, 2) problems with home, 3) needs a book to escape reality, 4) ends up in dreamland where he meets familar people, and 5) finally saves dreamland (Planet Drool) from the darkness! This is not to mention that the ICE PRINCESS is dressed exactly the same in both movies. But let's not dwell on unoriginality - many a good picture have taken from tried and proven themes (although not so liberally taken) and made a go of it. What bites worst of all in this movie is the utter vacuum it creates in what I want to say is 'continuity' but which really is probably due to the missing pieces of the script. Excellent characters, great background, great foreground, nice sets (CGI), super intro, then the actors open their mouths and you get something similar to a 6th grade holiday play or a dialogue from a ""CRITTER GITTERS"" episode on a Saturday afternoon. Shock doesn't even begin to describe the feeling associated with this movie which is strickly a money-maker based on the Rodriguez name.

As far as acting goes, Sharkboy seems to be the real killer in this production and the boy named Max (played by Cayden Boyd) is good too (very similar to the boy, Bastion, in The Never Ending Story). Lava Girl couldn't act her way out of a paper bag - but that failing hasn't stopped Mary-Kate and Ashley in their ventures. The parents and Lopez characters are so-so, given what they are forced to say.

But, the real frenzy with this movie begins with the questionable use of the name ""Sharkboy"". It is also the name a semi-famous pro-Wrestler who has reportedly sued Rodriguez for copyright infringement.

Basically, I am giving this movie 2 stars for its hi-tech special effects and 3-D output (if you like 3-D) which are a nice touch to an otherwise average kid's flick. But even my 10 year old son showed signs of weariness and complained that it tended to be a bit ""weird"", so these special effects are not everything. Save yourself the trouble and the money - watch Sharkboy wrestle on TV because you know that professional TV wrestling is real.

As the movie opens Max (Cayden Boyd) is telling a story about how he meet Shark Boy (Taylor Lautner) and Lava Girl (Taylor Dooley) to his class, and like I said before, they just don't beleive him. And even his teacher Mr. Electricidad (George Lopez) tells him secretly have class to make some friends, and even that they are just all pretend, and just live in the real world, there is also a Bully Linus (Jacob Davich) who picks on him, even in class, but Mr. Electricidad still defends Max, and tells Linus to stop picking on Max. And at home, all his Dad (David Arquette) and Mom (Kristen Davis) does his fight, you have to wonder if dirvoce is in the question. But luck changes for Max when Shark Boy and Lava Girl shows up in class, even during what looks like to be a tornato, and annouces they are looking for Max. Also Max likes to keep a dream Journel to help him remember his dreams, even the class Bully Linus steals it and messes it up.

It begins with a kid named Max who wants nothing more than toys games cookies and most of all his two idiot rolemodels. This movies story is made origionaly up by the directors 4 year old nut-case of a son. everything on this movie is fake the characters are fake what idiot would call his sons actual name sharkboy how can a little boy grow gils and fins even the power rangers are better than this!!! go watch herbie instead it at least has more people watching it.,1129939200,,530,4.257425742574258
2373709,1,B000A6T2BM,"I watched this movie only because I was staying with my cousins and they were cuirous as to what it was about. By the end we were all like, ""That was the biggest waste of my time ever!"" Seriously, my eleven year old brother (who is a very creative personnage and talented artist), could have done better than this pathetic excuse for a motion picture when he was three. ANd then I went and watched the special features, only to find that most of the movie was created by the directors four year old son! If anyone should be able to make a movie at that age it should have been my brother KYle.

  For one thing, everything from the plot to the dialogue was so horrible I wanted to scream.

  THe entire storyline was complete anarchy and made so many leaps and bounds it was nausiating.

  The dialogue (particularly on SHark Boy's part) seemed to me to be a cross between a badly translated Japanese samuri movie, Kung Pow, and just a hint of Tolkein for good measure or something. In the end, the result was utter garbage.

  I HATED how sudden elements to the story suddenly appeared or came out of nowhere. Such as Lava Girl's desperate quest for her identity. I mean really, Shark BOy is trying to get Max, who dreamed up the world their stuck on, to get them out of a situation by dreaming. THen suddenly out of the blue, Lava Girl wants to know where she came from and what her purpose is. THere was abosolutely NO mention of this before hand and was down right annoying the rest of the time.

  THe acting was TERRIBLE! I couldn't believe that actors that bad existed. The worst of these was the actor who did Max, it was like he had just graduated from preschool and was just repeating the lines he had heard from the directors as best he could. THere was no emotion or desireable quality in any of it.

  George Lopez did provide a bit of comic relief, and even though my brothe disliked the movie about as much as I did, he still quotes the line ""YOU turned me into a big, round bad guy!"" incessively. However, this sad bit of effort was like trying to prevent the world trade centers from falling by using a fishing pole. Hopeless...

  I wasn't expecting much from this movie, so I wasn't all that disappointed. But I know for sure, Shark Boy and Lava GIrl will never be seen again by me.",1129680000,2,2301,4.329439252336448
2373710,4,B000A6T2BM,"Age six to ten audiences usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to major feature films. Although technically films like ""Elf"" and ""Toy Story"" target this demographic, the marketing people insist that these productions incorporate adult elements and humor to expand the target audience and maximize attendance; these are called ""family films"" and the additional elements take much away from the identification experience that children most enjoy. The only escape from these multi-generational things are preschool stuff like ""Clifford's Really Big Movie"" and ""Muppets from Space"" which no one in the 6-10 group would admit to watching, let alone liking.

Then along comes Robert Rodriguez with ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", a film that gives 6-10 audiences exactly what they want without even the slightest attempt to appeal to older viewers (well maybe middle schoolers will get crushes on Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Since this is a new animal to most critics, it gets blasted for not being what they wanted it to be, a family film. And teenagers complain that it is not as good as ""Spy Kids"", a Rodriguez film that not only targeted a broader audience but which most of them watched several years ago when they were preteens. To be fair, while Rodriguez did not make ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" for 14 year olds who saw ""Spy Kids"" 4-5 years ago, the distributors did attempt to market it to those audiences-who are now angry about being misled although I think the trailer gives a pretty accurate representation of the film.

So don't let the negative reviews and comments discourage anyone in the target audience from seeing this film. There are plenty of positive reviews and comments from critics who have a clue about Rodriguez's intentions and from the viewers in his target audience. There will be a lot of Sharkboys and Lavagirls out trick or treating this year and the film will become a classic to those who first see it at a young age.

Which is not to say that only those in its target audience will  enjoy the film, it is a fun children's tale that might be described as a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Yellow Submarine"". In one respect it is better because almost all the actors are kids; Rodriguez understands that a lot of adult characters in a children's film is a less than zero situation. And it has very good messages: emphasizing the value of dreams, how dreaming better (i.e. unselfishly) increases that value, and how working to make your dreams come true maximizes that value (the young hero's name is ""Max""). Plus Sharkboy and Lavagirl are friends who demonstrate a willingness to risk their lives to save each other. It is entertaining just to watch kids (both girls and boys) get into it.

Speaking of less than zero, the advantage of seeing this on DVD versus in a theater is having the option to watch in 2-D. The 3-D version subtracts instead of adding, as much of the brightness and life of the film are lost to the crude 3-D cardboard glasses process they used. The only useful thing about the 3-D (other than a mildly interesting visual effect for those who have never experienced it) is the interactive aspect; as signs flash on the screen telling when to put on and take off the polarizing glasses. The DVD contains both versions and the 2-D one is first rate.

2373711,4,B000A6T2BM,"Robert Rodriguez uses CGI to create one imaginative landscape after the next. It's the kind of movie kids will love because it doesn't talk down to them. They are the heroes much like in the Spy Kids movies but this one isn't nearly as inventive. Once Max, SharkBoy and LavaGirl arrive on Planet Drool, the film really opens up visually, utilizing the 3-D technology quite effectively.

For example, at one point our heroes fly over a landscape of brains on the way to the World of Milk and Cookies which features rivers of milk with chocolate chip cookie rafts that transport our protagonists through this world filled with frosting capped ice cream scoop hills.

The Adventures of SharkBoy and LavaGirl in 3-D is a good fantasy film for kids and should appeal to them because it imagines them as brave superheroes with great powers. Unlike most kids movies this one is filled with all kinds of clever ideas and colourful images without being an obvious feature-length ad for a toy line or video game.

There is an audio commentary by director Robert Rodriguez. He made this movie with a lot of his family. His son Racer Max (who joins him for a bit) came up with the story and many of the characters. As always, the filmmaker delivers an engaging and informative commentary. One quickly gets the impression that he's an extremely creative guy and this extends to his kids.

""Creating `SharkBoy and LavaGirl' with Racer Max"" features Rodriguez narrating home movies of he and his kids as they draw and talk about the movie.

The messages are clear, but not heavy handed. There's lots of foreshadowing but it too is not obvious.

The cinematography and special effects are visually appealing. We rented the 2-D version, and that's the version we'll buy. You can tell which elements were 3-D, but they aren't distracting in the 2-D version.

I spent the first half of the film waiting for some sort of plot to develop,and then I spent the second half of the film wishing it would end. Sharkboy doesn't say much in the movie at all except to unexpectedly yell at lava girl from time to time although they're supposed to be working together. Lava girl is an airhead and without any strong caharacters, and no real plot the movie seems to go in circles and circles and then finally has mercy on all of us viewers and ends.

The setup is a little simplistic and the child actors aren't always great, but there are moments of poignance. Lava Girl's alternation between hero worship of and frustration with Max reveals a complex relationship between creation and creator. When she cries ""Why did you dream me up? Am I supposed to be evil? What's my purpose?"" there's a deep sense of anguish, surprising for a kid's movie.

The 3-d effect was also fairly good on my TV, and most of the time the movie made pretty good use of it. Of course, there were also gratuitous ""let's throw things at the audience"" parts throughout.

The commentary was a disappointment. Most commentary tracks from Robert Rodriguez feel very carefully prepared and delivered, with a dense flow of information not only about the production on screen, but about creativity, motivation, family, and moviemaking. In Shark Boy & Lava Girl, he's content to just talk about the genesis of this particular movie and give a few behind-the-scenes insights.

It is very enjoyable, but the story just barely stays afloat.  There are some very fun, very cheesy, very excellent scenes in this movie that do a great job of teaching people to believe in themselves and follow their dreams.  As a film with a theme of hope for young viewers, I think it was excellent.  I say it is Robert Rodriguez's worst film only because it seemed to rely more on the gimmick of 3D than anything else.  Spy Kids 3D was a great ride that was worthy of 5 stars.  Sharkboy and Lavagirl has some excellent visual imagery and makes great use of the 3D glasses, but it seems put together more haphazardly and the story just doesn't work as well as the story in Spy Kids.

Don't get me wrong, I'm giving it 4 stars because I will watch it over and over again.  It's a very fun movie if you're under 10, which is definitely the age bracket this movie was aimed towards.

My 5 year-old son jumped out of his seat after the movie and shouted, ""We have to get this on DVD when it comes out!""  He is normally very reserved, and it is not common for him to have this reaction to a movie.  The story is like a weak plot for a video game, but this probably works well for the kids.  The effects were pretty good, though they couldn't resist over-doing the 3D aspect a few times (how many times do we need to see someone spit into the audience?).

We will probably end up getting this movie for the kids.  It's not a movie we all can enjoy like ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" or ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" but hey, it's ""for the kids"" after all.",1122940800,4,800,4.1558441558441555

I hope when this comes out on dvd that we will be able to watch it in 3-D at home like the realease of Spy Kids 3-D:Game Over on dvd!

Well,theres my review! I`m sure you`ll like this movie,and maybe love it! Thanks for reading my review! Hope it helped!",1120348800,2,659,4.53781512605042
2373829,4,B000A6T2BM,"I really wanted to rate it 3.5 stars, but I can't so I rounded up!  Reading the other reviews, it amuses me how many people gave it 1 star because of bad acting/special effects, etc as if it can be compared to other regular films.  This is a kids movie, and if you watch it expecting something else, you WILL be disappointed.

Now for the review of the movie.  This is much better than Spy Kids 3D, hands down.  The 3D effects are good, including lots of stuff flying at you or people pointing at you.  The kids in the audience were thrilled.  Even I was amused.  True, they should've used the gray 3D instead of the blue/red because it would've preserved the dazzling color we all saw in the film's trailer.  So yes, the 3D portion does have that weird purplish hue that plagued Spy Kids 3D.  But that doesn't stop you from enjoying the scenery.  Kids and adults will find this aspect of the film highly entertaining.  As expected, the 3D is what makes this film.

The adult actors (most notably Kristin Davis and David Arquette) are not as into the film as we'd like, but their role in the film is very small anyways.  The kids in the film, however, are really into it!  They're not the best actors in the world, but they're very good.  I'd say they're better than any actor in the Star Wars prequels.

The story is a wildly imaginative spin on The Neverending Story.  A boy, Max, is at school one day when his imaginary superheroes Sharkboy and Lavagirl come and whisk him away to Planet Drool, which he created in his dreams.  He has to save it from 'The Darkness' by dreaming it back into health.  Yes, it's been done before (Planet Drool = Fantasia, The Darkness = The Nothing), but for a new generation, it's a very neat movie!  What kid has never dreamed of being taken away by imaginary superheroes to a new world where everyone has powers?  I know I did when I was a kid.  On a side note, I found it amusing to see the old original Game Boy and an old 8-bit NES controller in the film.  Ah, nostalgia!

I went to see this movie expecting something to see while I turned my brain off.  And that's exactly what I got.  It kept me entertained, and I got my money's worth.  I'd recommend anyone to take their kids to see it.",1120089600,,2230,4.295673076923077
2373830,1,B000A6T2BM,"I saw this and was shocked how horrible it was. Seriously, I reccomend this for kids under 10 ONLY. Kids who have never seen a 3D movie would really enjoy it, but those who have and those who have seen better would hate it. This sad, defensless kid writes this book of things he dreams about and takes it for granted that everything that he writes is real. Then no one believes him and so on. Then Shark boy and Lava girl break in and take the kid to some weird planet. Then random problems and drama take up most of the rest of the movie. Also, random things happen that make you disgusted like when the scene was all dramatic, Shark boy sings a little song that is like 2 minutes that must have been copied off a Nick Jr. show or something. Another one is that Lava Girl keeps dying for some reason. Why, she probably dies like 10 times in just 30 minutes. Also, shark boy gets really violent in a lot of scenes. He is always like ""Maybe I shoulf punch your brains out"" and ""Still hungery? I'll give you a knuckle sandwhich!"" Of course, this would amusing to little kids but not mature kids.

At the end of this movie, don't be surprised if your child pretends to be like Lava Girl or Shark Boy and talk about the movie until you go mad. Also expect them to be like ""Dreams are lovely. Always follow your dreams."" or something. When I saw it, the theatre was almost bare and at the end I thought ""No wonder."" This movie is really horrible. The 3D graphics are lacking [You know, the usal, one lense red and the other blue] and the acting was really bad and the script was horrible! I'm taking for granted that this must be the worst movie ever created and I am not lying. Please only take kids that are under 10. I hated it.",1120089600,2,1726,4.198795180722891

2373853,1,B000A6T2BM,"I love to take my neice to children's movies, and usually find myself enjoying them as much or more than she does.  Not so this one.  The adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl had to be one of the most ill-conceived, poorly developed projects to ever make it through Hollywood.  Riding on his success with the Spy Kids movies (which were so superior to this it isn't funny), Rodriguez must have found himself in a position where he didn't need to get script approval from anyone.  It shows.  If an unknown scriptwriter had tried to present this to a studio she or he would have been laughed right out of town.  Unfortunately, Rodriguez managed to bypass all the checks and balances that veto bad stories and pushed this project through.  I sat through the entire movie, as painful as it was, with my neice.  Nearly a third of the audience walked out before it was over.  They were the smart ones.",1119484800,2,894,4.5375

As a homeschooling mother of five, (teaching for 19 years) I am always looking for ways to encourage learning AND imagination.  This movie blessed us with; a positive way to deal with bullies, a friend risking their life for another friend, 'believing in yourself' (what purpose you were created for) and tons of intelligent puns!  I'm having my kids write a report on this movie as I usually do when one comes around as good as this!

The 3-D effects were fun and thoroughly enjoyable, even for a Grammy like me.  My grandson wanted to rush home and start drawing his own cartoon book series after the movie.  Very inspiring, creative and uplifting.  I highly recommend it.",1118793600,11,394,4.720588235294118
2373856,3,B000A6T2BM,"I had high expectations for this film when I sat down to watch it with my daughter.  Both she and I enjoyed watching Rodriguez' other kiddie flicks, the ""Spy Kids"" films, and we were expecting something just as entertaining.  Unfortunately, ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" just didn't hold up that well.

The story revolves around a kid named Max and a world that exists only in his dreams, or so he thought.  In this world, Planet Drool, everything that Max dreams about, including daydreams, comes to life.  The two most important things are Shark Boy and Lava Girl.  They are a pair of superheroes who basically have a run of the entire dream world.

When Max tells his classmates about his two favorite heroes, the class laughs at him for thinking that the duo actually exists.  However, when Shark Boy and Lava Girl come to get Max to help them save Planet Drool, the kids begin to believe him.  What follows is a computer-animated dream sequence that makes up the bulk of the film.  It includes a literal ""train of thought,"" a land of giant milk and cookies, and a nasty dude named Mr. Electric, whom Max dreamed up and based on his school teacher, Mr. Electricidad(George Lopez).  Max and his pair of superfriends have to save Planet Drool from Mr. Electric and another bad guy from the real world named Linus, who calls himself ""Minus"" in the dream world.

You'd think a story filled with such vivid and bright worlds and characters would be fun to watch, but the 3-D aspect of this film muddles the colors to a bland blue and red tint.  Also, the 3-D gets pretty old very quick.  There are plenty of explosions, sneezes, spittle, etc. that fly at the screen that try to make you lean back in your seat, but fail.  There's also a lot of pointing, close-ups, and even a ""brain storm"" resulting in a brain ""sticking"" to the movie screen.

The acting isn't that great either.  George Lopez just seems to be going through the motions in his dual role, and David Arquette and Kristen Davis are bland at best as Max's parents.  The kid that plays Max has some pretty garish looks on his face that I'm guessing are supposed show fear, but he just looks silly.

The idea of the dream world is the best part of the flick.  Heavy on word play, a lot of things take on a literal form like the aforementioned ""train of thought.""  Shark Boy and Lava Girl aren't bad either, though Shark Boy's dance number seems way out of place in this flick.

The story has a good message of always following and believing your dreams no matter how silly they may seem.  But in the end, this flick just doesn't have enough gas to keep children fully interested.  In fact, my daughter(she's four) took off her glasses just a few minutes into the story.  She enjoyed it more with her glasses off because she got to see the vibrant colors better, even though the picture was ""fuzzy"" to her.  I managed to keep my glasses on throughout the flick, but once in awhile I would look over them to take in the colors.

Unless your children are under the age of ten, I'd wait until this thing hits the rental racks or pay-per-view channels before watching it.  If you don't have children, skip this one altogether.  There isn't much that appeals to the adult demographic.  In fact, nothing appeals to adults.  That's not a bad thing, but Rodriguez could have at least thrown in a couple of inside jokes for the parents.

Only recommended for kids under ten, though older kids who've never experienced 3-D before might get a kick out of it.",1118620800,30,3502,4.500792393026941
2373857,5,B000A6T2BM,"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl is by far the best movie I've ever seen.  It combines the efluscent star power of Around The World in 80 Days, the profound poignancy of Schindler's List, and the awesome production value of any Star Wars movie.  Star Cayden Boyd is one of the most talented actors of the decade, the new Spencer Tracy, a cross between Tracy and Laurence Olivier - and only eleven years old.  The plot is well plotted and the outstanding camera work just jumps right out of the screen at you - especially if you wear the 3-D glasses provided.  The script is well scripted and the lighting well lit. If there's any flaw in this movie, it's that Lava Girl is just a bit too young - she should have been played by Nicole Kidman.  However, Taylor Dooley's acting talents are more than a match for Kidman, and she makes Lava Girl live and makes us feel her identity crisis which .... but I don't want to give away any plot surprises and spoil it -- go see Shark Boy and Lava Girl NOW!
Oh, and by the way, there's an awesome robot named Tobor.  His name is ""robot"" spelled backwards, which comes from a classic 1950's sci-fi flick, ""Tobor The Great.""",1118620800,3,1169,4.364055299539171
