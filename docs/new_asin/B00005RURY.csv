7952668,1,B00005RURY,"I have never seen a movie more pathetic.  The ratings I viewed on here that are positive must only come from those with personal interests.  I was at its premiere debut and was even beyond bored and that's saying much since I knew people in the film.  I only write this to protect the consumer from ridiculous claims.  This movie is slower than slow and has the quality of a ten year-old with an old 16mm camera!!!!!  If only I could give it a zero star, sigh.",1128902400,3,460,4.241379310344827
7952669,4,B00005RURY,"This film had a good amount of martial arts which were obviously performed by the actors themselves.  Very rare in this day and age.  It seems anymore that there are standins for this or standins for that but when a movie like this comes along it is nice to see some very talented martial artists who are able to apply their martial prowess on film.  This film was also a fantastic display of action without relying on the typical blood,gore and nudity shown in quite a few other films of the same genre.  It is refreshing to see some high caliber fighting and very good acting in a low budget film.  I would recommend this film to anyone who misses the days of just plain old martial arts action.",1018224000,2,697,4.372093023255814
7952670,1,B00005RURY,"Yikes!
Never before have I seen such a poorly developed plot, negligent editing, and  a haphazard, undeveloped group of characters shoved into one suffering film. I would NOT reccomend this film. Overall, this film falls way short of meeting the standards of the beloved low-budget martial arts flicks of yesteryear.
20 years down the line, the makers of this film will sound like Adam West when he claims that the Batman series was ""all for fun"" and ""not to be taken seriously.""",1017792000,12,479,4.841463414634147
7952671,1,B00005RURY,"...and I see a movie that follows closely in the footsteps of the lower budget Cynthia Rothrock movies.
Dragon and the Hawk has to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. This martial arts film (using the phrase in its most liberal form), had sloppy, poorly coordinated fight scenes, little to no character development, and bad editing. Dont waste your time with this flick, yor better off watching the drunks behind 7-11 duke it out, its more entertaining and at least they can fight!
For the record...its LOUISIANA",1015977600,9,523,4.695652173913044
7952672,1,B00005RURY,This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. In one scene it went from winter to spring and back.  The fight scenes were down right funny. maybe the actors should of watched A Rocky film to see how to throw a punch. in the end I feel it is best to save your money and watch old reruns of Batman,1010102400,10,299,3.901639344262295
7952673,4,B00005RURY,Dragon and the Hawk had my nod for the years best action adventure picture.  Barbara Gehring gives the performance of a lifetime in this thriller filmed in Denver.  Enjoy it with pleasure.,1009411200,3,188,4.84375
7952674,5,B00005RURY,"Dragon & Hawk is a very entertaining bit of film work by Mr. Mark Grove.
Destined to be a classic genre film, D&H takes the viewr aback to the earlier days of MA films.  It has a very No Retreat; No Surrender-ish quality about it that I really enjoyed.
Action is good.  Storyline is the ""chinese brother comes to US to find lost sister"" theme.  It reads really well, considering it ts plotline has been done quite frequently.
Dragon Pak is an excellent martial artist and moves well on screen.  Even Mr Grove makes his on screen cameo...",1007856000,5,537,4.448979591836735
7952675,5,B00005RURY,"I have just seen the movie Dragon and Hawk. That was a good one. I have seen many action packed movies and this one is in a leage all its own. The carators are all very professional and well intuned with their parts. The action scenes are all action and more action. The caractor ""Dragon Pak"" looking for his sister and the evil scientist with his scary eye's. That was a trip. I would really love to see more of Mark Groves work. He really knows what he is doing. My suggestion to everyone is sit back grab a bowl of popcorna dn enjoy. This movie will capture your heart and send you adrenaline through the roof. Its the movie to watch. If you love action pretty women and nasty fights this is it. All in one.",1007769600,4,710,4.189781021897811
7952676,4,B00005RURY,"I'm not normally a very big fan of martial arts films - I need more than lots of good fight scenes to really enjoy a movie.  This one has more.  Most of the (admittedly very few) martial arts movies I've seen have fairly week plots that serve only to carry the action, and little in the way of a true story, character developement, humor (Jackie Chan movies being a notable exception), etc.
Dragon and the Hawk is a pleasant exception.  It has a tight plot that delivers a good story without any notable plot holes,
Very good dialogue and reasonable character developement, a bit of humor sprinkled in, believable characters that are well-acted, and a high-energy soundtrack to go with the high-energy action. The evil scientist Therion (Trygve Lode) is downright creepy...
So by now you may be wondering why I rate it ""only"" four stars.
Well, for starters 4-1/2 stars wasn't one of the options.  Another is that I'm very picky - the only martial arts films I've ever rated five stars are Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon.  I think this film could have used a little more character developement, and little more humor.  Plus I've always believed that virtually any film can be improved with a liberal dose of gratuitous nudity - but then that's me :)
All in all, I think Dragon and the Hawk is an excellent film, even for people like me that aren't all that into martial arts films. And for those of you who are, you won't be disappointed - if it's fight scenes you want, Dragon and the Hawk really delivers!",1005696000,4,1503,4.568773234200743
