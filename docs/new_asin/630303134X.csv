534847,5,630303134X,"With Ashes and Diamonds, Andrzej Wajda completed his trilogy concerning the Polish experience during World War II.  It is the last day of the war, and a young Republican resistance fighter, Maciek, has been assigned to  assassinate a high ranking member of the Communist resistance.  Maciek's  experiences leading up to the killing--his contact with the kindly  Communist leader, his romance with a young barmaid--seriously undermine his  initial allegiance to the dying Republican cause.  Director (and former  resistance member) Wajda brilliantly portrays the fratricidal impulses  guiding Poland immediately after the war--impulses which ultimately  prostrated Poland under a Communist regime for decades.  The  directionlessness and confusion of postwar Poland is evident in Wajda's  treatment and, although it is never directly seen, the Soviet Union's Red  Army is unmistakably present.  In its entirety, the trilogy of A  Generation, Kanal, and Ashes and Diamonds devastatingly documents the death  of Old Central Europe.  However, it is a testament to Wajda's talent that  Ashes and Diamonds can easily stand on its own.",921888000,15,1128,5.686746987951807

534869,5,630303134X,"A film has appeared which is probably the most complete artistic work based on recent history since The Wedding. It is rare indeed, and not only in film, for an for a young artist like Andrzej Wajda, at the start of his creative life, almost at its inception, to undertake a work which may well be the most outstanding work in his life. (...) The fight on the other side is also confined to two characters: Szczuka and the secretary of the regional Party committee. There have been voices raised in criticism, focusing on the fact that the communists in this film are unable to muster the strength neccssary to be an equal opponent in the conflict; the dramatic weakness of Szczuka weakens even Maciek's plight which, after all, was brought on by the victory of the communists in Poland. Such accusations seem to be misguided. By building Szczuka up, making him into a more dynamic, active character Wajda would overshadow Maciek's drama. Maciek is the hero of the film, the subject of a conflict whose object is Szczuka.
(Aleksander Jackiewicz, ""Trybuna Ludu"", Warsaw , 25 October 1958)

*****

Ashes and Diamonds, the best film to date produced in Poland, is at the same time the most Polish of films, reflecting our national fortunes. (...)
The artistic merits of the film seem to be beyond doubt. More controversial are the problems raised by the film and its political resonance, especially for the migr circles. I can hardly share these doubts. The accusations expressed in Poland by Wiktor Woroszylski that in Ashes and Diamonds the AK (Home Army) veterans have been deprived of a convincing rationale seem false to me. In my opinion, in 1945, after the collapse of their leaders' ideas, an objective rationale simply did not exist. Officially, even the AK did not exist at that time, so the moral aspect of assassination and the value of partisan activity in a hopeless political situation can be easily questioned. (...)
Every unprejudiced viewer must admit that Wajda's film displays maximum of understanding and human sympathy for both sides, or rather for the people on both sides inspired by honest motives. This compassion has caused a number of English critics to view Ashes and Diamonds as a psychological drama of individuals, and not a film about ""political murder"" as the English subtitle of the film states.
(Boleslaw Taborski, ""Kontynenty Nowy Merkuriusz"", London, July 1959)

*****

The real dimension of Ashes and Diamonds is eschatological; when all is said, the true passion in this film is not the passion for detailed historical recreation, but the passion of a moralizer with regard to elemental issues: life, death, beauty, love, and the nightmare of murder. Even if Wajda's intentions were different, his talent took the upper hand, and critics should always remain faithful to talent. There is a scene in Ashes and Diamonds where two people, the murderer and his victim, approach one another and fall into one another's arms, as if seeking salvation from a third party - destiny. This scene actually sums up the whole film in an ellipsis which brings to mind not Wyspianski or Styka, but rather Aeschylus and Shakespeare.
(Stanislaw Grochowiak, ""Ekran"", Warsaw, 19 October 1955)

*****

In sketching a portrait of his hero, Wajda avoided both conformism and exaggeration. He hasn't made him either into a monster or a degenerate, or even a ne'er-do-well, but simply a youth deformed by war. This is in keeping with the same honesty and attention to verisimilitude, which characterizes the presentation of the political and social climate in Poland at the moment of the allied victory. Advocates of the new and the old systems confront one another not as symbolic marionettes, but as people made of real flcsh and blood, hungering for a shred of hope. Furthermore, the film is beautiful in itself: well constructed, well played, and well narrated. Wajda can only be accused of occasionally falling into unnecessary aestheticism. As in earlier Kanal, some simply thrilling shots are juxtaposed to others which seem to be overly sophisticated. The bluntness of the subject demanded formal rigours which the director did not always have the courage to respect. But this is only a detail. Wajda will quickly overcome his noisy elation. At 32 years of age he has proven that he is a thoroughbred creative artist and ertainly one of the most talented creators of the European ""new wave"".

534870,5,630303134X,"""Ashes and Diamonds""is the third of 3 films by Andrzej Wajda about Poland at the end of World War 2, a period in which he himself was a resistance fighter. His previous film ""Kanal' (1956) told the story of the Warsaw Uprising, a 2 month struggle by the Polish resistance movement to liberate Warsaw from Nazi occupation while the Russians were advancing. But the Russians slowed down their advance and the Poles were left to struggle alone against the Nazis, probably because the Russians wanted the Polish resistance weakened so they could control Poland uncontested after the war. The result was that tens of thousands of Polish and German fighters were killed or wounded, hundreds of thousands of civilians killed, and the city devastated.

That film took place in September 1944. This film takes up in a small unnamed town in May1945 at the time of the Nazi surrender.  The story centers on the assassination of a Communist Secretary, but this is merely a vehicle to explore life for the various people, from the Mayor to businessmen, a restaurant owner, a waitress, and resistance fighters who now find that the Russians have replaced the Germans as their rulers.

Each of the various protagonists must face their own moral dilemma, whether it is the assistant to the Mayor who must weigh advancement in the party with the loss of national control, the assassin who must decide between love and politics, or the Secretary whose long lost son has turned up as a resistance fighter.

Zbigniew Cybulski (resistance fighter and potential assassin) and Ewa Kryzewska (waitress) are excellent as the star crossed lovers, and Waclaw Zastrzeznski is also good as the weary Secretary who is resigned to his fate but will not go lightly.

The black and white photography is very good, reminiscent in many parts of Bergman's style especially in the use of close-ups and the long soliloquies.

Wajda (1926) is a Polish film director who has 4 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign film - ""The Promised Land"" (1975), ""The Maids of Weilko"" (1979), ""Man of Iron"" (1981), and ""Katyri"" (2007) and won a BAFTA for ""Danton"" (1983). He won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for ""Kanal"" (1956), ""Man of Marble"" (1977), ""Bez znieczulenia"" (1978) and ""Man of Iron"" (1981).

When the film appeared, Stalin has been dead for only 3 years and the de-Stalinization of Poland was only just starting. Post WW 2 Communist rule of Poland continued for 40+ years, ending in 1989.

As the 3rd part of a trilogy, the film makes more sense if you have seen one or both of the previous films. It's not uncomprehendable without the previous films, but seeing them will place things into better context (e.g., Cybulski was part of the resistance fighters who featured prominently in ""Kanal"", the second film).

The film is also slow, for American audiences, though the pace is certainly normal for European films.

The subtitles are on for a very short period, which is funny given the length of the scenes, so you'll have to read quickly.

This is a very good film about a subject that is rarely covered. Anyone interested in World War 2 will find this a priceless gem.",1306800000,2,3126,4.82429906542056
534871,5,630303134X,"The third in Director Andrej Wadja's war trilogy, Ashes and Diamonds is set in Poland on the last day of WW2. The German High Command have issued their unconditional surrender and the Communists quickly fill the vacuum left by Hitler's goose-steppers and set up shop. Warsaw is lousy with rats and not all of them are of the rodent variety as power hungry bureaucrats jostle for position in the new order.

 Having spent the last half a decade under the Nazi junta; the prospect of a future under Stalin's jackboot is met with keen opposition. Maciek, a resistance fighter, is ordered to kill a local Socialist party official, which he is more than happy to do, but soon discovers he has killed two innocent civilians instead.

 Maciek books a room at a rundown hotel where his quarry is staying. While he waits for the right moment to make amends he meets and falls in love with the barmaid Krystyna. His connection to the girl leads him to rethink his part in the endless cycle of violence.

The central role of Maciek was played by the brilliant Zybigniew Cybulski who came to be known as the `Polish James Dean.' Dean's death in a highway smash in 1955 meant he would never fulfil his promise and so would forever be frozen in movie goer's minds as a deeply troubled boy. Cybulski was 30 when he played the role that made him and gives us a glimpse of what his western counterpart could have achieved. Cybulski's Maciek is a worldly wise, vodka fuelled skirt chaser, (not a million miles away from his real life persona allegedly) and far from being made twisted and bitter by his war experiences, Cybulski plays the character as a man who laughs at the cruel joke of life that his been played on all of us and is determined to ""have fun and not be swindled"" even in the face of imminent annihilation.

 It was a conscious decision on Wadja and Cybulski's part that despite their story taking place in 1945, ASHES AND DIAMONDS' central character was going to be `all out' 50's cool. Parts Brando, Dean and Clift - Maciek, in his army fatigues and `sun-glasses after dark' became a symbol for Polish teenagers who would emulate his style for years to come; and his Anna Karenna-esque death beneath the wheels of a late night train in 1967 only exacerbated his legendary status. Even now we see shades of him in any number of Hong Kong `glock operas' and John Cusack's `assassin in Raybans' from Grosse Point Blank is a clearly a direct decendant.

Often charged with being overloaded with symbolism as scenes are obscured by upside down crucifixes; characters rendered almost invisible in morning light whilst unfurling flags or inexplicably joined by white horses as they ponder the possibilities of a brighter future, ASHES AND DIAMONDS makes no secret of its Expressionist credentials. The youthful hero dying on a mountainous rubbish dump to the accompaniment of screeching crows is an image lifted almost directly from Van Gogh's apocalyptic `Crows over Wheatfield's'.

Two years after Cybulski met his destiny on the snowy platform of Wroclaw station Wadja made EVERYTHING FOR SALE about an actor missing from the set of a film. The missing actor was clearly meant to be Cybulski who even in death dominated every scene. It still stands as probably the best film an actor never made.",1161043200,6,3292,4.741258741258742

Ashes and Diamonds begins on the day when World War II ended for Poland. A day which brought with it celebration but also uncertainty. The war has ended and things are still viscous but like molten rock, this state is temporary. Enter the charismatic carefree Maciek and the serious Andrzej, two Polish exiles who joined the resistance in 1941 when they were fighting the Germans for a free Poland. With the war over, and the Russians invading their country, this was not the victory they imagined. And so they lay beside a country church basking in the sunlit clarity of a warm beautiful day, waiting for the arrival of a local communist party chairman, so they can fill him full of lead and then head for their next assignment. But things are not clear at all and in Maciek's obvious enthusiasm for his job, he executes two innocent men, though he will not learn of his error until later in the 24 hours period during which this film takes place. By that time the clear sky will turn dark with rain and Maciek's resolve to ""finish"" the job will be severely weakened by the beautiful barmaid, Krystyna, who awakens within him a dormant faith in humanity and the possibility of love and happiness. Ashes and Diamonds is a film that constantly paces back and forth between differing visions of a Post WWII Poland - not surprising since director Wajda had to walk a fine line between his fellow Poles and the Soviet censors. Most of the film takes place in darkness and the characters, like the film itself pace back and forth struggling with an existential anguish that is almost crushing. The enormous weight of responsibility when life becomes more than simply surviving. The decision to act or not to act - both have far reaching consequences. The films emotional core takes place during a masterfully shot scene in a hotel room with both Maciek and Krystnya emotionally and physically naked. Cinematographer Jerzy Wojcik, who graces this film with many unforgettable images, gives us still another and with muted lense dissolves one lovers face into another interchangeably to suggest a coming together of souls. Once carefully measured exteriors are being melted by buried emotion like the way lava changes the face of a mountain. ""Don't touch me"" remarks Krystnya during a particularly tender moment, but these words are said not as a threat but as a last gasp defensive measure. ""I don't want any good-byes or memories to leave behind."" Soon the two lovers will sneak out into the night, ""God, life can be so beautiful sometimes."" Says Maciek with enthusiasm just prior to a downpour that will have them scurring into the shelter of the burned out ash filed ruins of a church, with Jesus on a crucifix hanging upside down above the ruble. It is here that Krystnya reads an inscription from the Polish Poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid which will spur the dormant revolutionary within Maciek into action.

Thus, it helps to know a bit of Polish history before viewing this film. The story: Manciek is a young solider in the right-wing Nationalist Army who is ordered at the conclusion of the war to assassinate the newly-arrived Communist District Secretary. In the meantime, he falls in love. The film then becomes a discussion of conscience v. loyalty, with Manciek living in both the established and criminal world and often crossing the line between a life with his new girlfriend and his continued life as a revolutionary. The title itself (taken from Norwid's romantic poem) obviously plays into this conflict.
Wajda's films do not avoid bitterness and pessimism, and this film in particular treats art as a response to the problems of society, revealing the factors that emphasize its complexes as well as its symptoms. At the end of the film, the immediate devastation has ended; but, the ongoing devastation has only begun. In fact, Wajda seems to say, it is a devastation with no end in sight because it is imposed by a memory that makes the line between life and death a thin one; Manciek wears dark glasses because his eyes could never adjust to the light after his time spent in the sewers during the Polish resistance. ""Will there remain among the ashes,"" the Polish poet Norwid asked, ""a star-like diamond, the dawn of eternal victory?""

If Marty Scorsese tells you that 'Ashes and Diamonds' is one of his favorite movies, it's likely that many will accept his viewpoint without a critical eye (that is the power of the influential American auteur, Mr. Scorsese). Of course it's easy to understand why Scorsese is enamored with the film, mainly due to the 'Citizen Kane-like' cinematography and all those brilliant little 'cinematic' moments (such as the film's iconic ending where anti-hero Maciek is shot and ends up in the fetal position, on a trash heap). But despite the cinematic style that Mr. Scorsese so adores, one cannot ignore the reality of the time in which the film was made and the compromises director Andrzej Wajda was forced to make.

Ashes and Diamonds was released in 1958 and the English translation version in 1962. Poland of course was under the thumb of the Soviets and to give director Wadja the benefit of the doubt, he was in no position to make a film that was critical of the Communists who were ruling Poland at the time. Thus, Szczuka, the Commissar who returns to Poland on VE day (May 8, 1945) and who is the subject of an assassination attempt by Home Army operatives at the beginning of the film, must be depicted as a wholly sympathetic figure who has the best interests of the Polish people at heart. Szczuka is also a tragic figure, who, at the moment he's on his way to re-connect with his son (a captured Home Army sympathizer who was raised by an anti-Communist aunt), is unmercifully cut down by Maciek.

What's missing here in this film is political context. Sure there may have been well-meaning 'patriots' such as Szczuka amongst the Communists but what about the dark side of Communist rule? The Polish Home Army was the largest resistance group against the Nazis during World War II. The group was officially disbanded even before the end of the war in January 1945. A deal was made for thousands of former Home Army soldiers to receive 'amnesty' by the Soviets, but instead, after they accepted the amnesty deal, they were rounded up and sent to Soviet gulags, many never to be seen or heard from again. None of this important information, makes its way into the film.

Instead, Wadja, introduces a stock villain in the form of 'The Major' who was responsible for ordering the assassination of Szczuka, but instead finds himself responsible for the murder of two innocent factory workers. Both assassins, Maciek and Andrzej, appear to be trapped (in Wadja's view) by bad karma. Andrzej asks the Major whether it's really necessary to kill Szuzuka, but the Major won't entertain his question. And of course, Maciek, the brooding loner (modeled on James Dean), falls in love with a bar girl, but ultimately can't run away, and goes through with the murder of the kindly apparatchik.

Most of the plot revolves around a banquet given for the local mayor in a hotel. While this is happening, the plot to kill Szczuka slowly materializes as the backgrounds of each of the prinicipals is introduced. While the sub-plot involving Szczuka's son is somewhat interesting, Wadja (due to the constrictions of the time) is not permitted a Szczuka counterpart--one who shows the dark side of Soviet influence. As previously mentioned, the Major is too Machiavellian, without showing any of the other side's good points. And despite their 'sensitivity', Maciek and Andrzej, end up as ruthless as their commanding officer.

Perhaps Wadja's most interesting character is Drewnowski, the informant who loses his job in the mayor's office after becoming completely intoxicated. Drenowski perhaps represents the 'common man', tragically caught between the two warring factions in Polish society at the time, and unable to cope.

Ashes and Diamonds may have represented some kind of breakthrough for Polish cinema at the time it was released. Here, opponents of the ruling Communist government, are treated with some sympathy, as victims of some kind of inevitable and hence, tragic karmic law. Nonetheless, Wadja must ultimately throw the opponents of the ruling regime, under the proverbial bus. A more nuanced and clearer picture of these opponents, would ultimately appear, following the fall of Communism. Scorcese is right in heaping accolades over Ashes and Diamond's style; but its 'substance' is decidedly dated: stuck in a time, when people had to continually self-censor thoughts and words which they wished to say.",1406332800,4,4458,4.991924629878869

His target is a mid-level communist official who is also portrayed as neither hero nor villain.  He seems more interested in the fate of his son than building a workers' paradise.
