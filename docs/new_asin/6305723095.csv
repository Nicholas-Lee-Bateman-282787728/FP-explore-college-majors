8203876,5,6305723095,"I saw this movie quite awhile ago and was reminded about it during a conversation with my peers.  They felt the world was getting worse because no one cared.  This movie was one of the early films trying to empower young people from the hood to break the cycle of violence and despair.

Belinda Puentes rising star performance as a young woman torn between loving her aimless destuctive boyfriend and walking away from gang life usually doesn't register with an audience till it strikes close to home.  Television has now brought every human tragedy close to home.  Luckily Ms. Puentes character has enough self respect to walk away especially since she is the one with all the benefits maturity and common sense affords. Looking for great things from all the cast in this low budget slice of life
