1248870,4,B0000203Y5,"This is a great documentary. The DVD qualities are exceptional and the colors are great. The sound is very good. The style of narration is quite engrossing especially towards the end where the serendipitious ramblings of  the musicians thru NYC are juxtaposed with snippets of the Carnegie Hall  concert. Some shots drift away and you are not sure why or where - like the  shot where relics of Cuban communism are focused on as the singers sing  about their homeland. Why?
Personal highlights of the movie are the duet  session between Omara and Ibrahim - the electricity and respectful tension  in the recording studio are very palpable, the domino playing session  between Pia and friend just before a recording session, the childlike  wonderment of Pia and Ruben as NYC tourists, Omara walking the streets of  Havana and harmonising with a passerby, and the decaying grandeur of Havana  as a backdrop. The profile sessions of the musicians are well documented  and mingles very well with musical performances either in rehersal,  recording or in concert.
The only problem I have with this offering is  the Ry Cooder slide guitar flicks on certain songs. I am just not sure why?  If ever a note sounded out of tune and place, this was it - in more ways  than one. And was Cooder Jr. playing Cuban percussion instruments on some  sessions? I am not really sure.
I watched this three times yesterday  evening after getting it in the afternoon mail. It was a long evening but  well worth it.",945216000,4,1490,4.776470588235294
1248871,5,B0000203Y5,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is timeless and priceless. I was immediately interested in this movie because I had grown to love the album of the same name. I was completely caught off guard by  how much I came to truly enjoy the players and gain perspective into their  lifes and dreams. This movie makes you want to get up and chase your  dreams. It is a beautifully filmed tribute to music, age, friendship, and  the integrated fabric of Cuban culture. It makes you laugh, and tap your  toes. It is like watching 10 to 12 eighty year old Cinderellas go to the  ball, and bring down the house.",945129600,11,620,4.301724137931035
1248872,5,B0000203Y5,"I watched the movie on the plane, I cried like never before. The best of best latin musicians were literally found on the streets, gathered together by Mr. Cooper and his son-in-law  in amasing ansamble of voices and  players. This movie is a treasury because those voices and techniquis would  have been lost. I am anxious to buy a tape and will look forward to a  soundtrack.",940636800,5,377,4.582089552238806

1248875,5,B0000203Y5,"Excelente documental sobre la musica criolla de Cuba, sus interpretes, el campo, sus vidas, sus suenos y el humor que caracteriza a estos queridos  viejos personajes de la Cuba de antano. El documental no solo es un deleite  visual pero un extra ordinario viaje musical por el campo cubano. La musica  tradicional de Cuba, como lo es el son, la guajira, y el bolero, son  acompanadas por un toque hipnotico de la guitarra ""slide"" de Ry  Cooder y del acompanamiento percusivo del tambor Udu de su hijo Joachim.  Las voces de Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo, y Eliades Ochoa, entre otros,  nos perfuma con el olor a cana, ron, y tabaco de una celebracion entre  viejos amigos.

1248879,5,B0000203Y5,"I ordered this DVD to use as a supplement to a Latin music unit with my Spanish students. This is an incredible documentary that lives up to its description on the cover and much more!

Musicians introduce themselves and tell their story in Spanish, subtitled in English. They talk about their family, childhood and their music/instruments, as well as the hardships they've had to overcome in their lives. The story telling is accompanied with music and snap shots of their album recording sessions, and sold out concert at Carneggie Hall.

Music greats such as Ibrahim Ferrer and Compay Segundo take you inside their delapidating homes in old Havanna, and give you a glimpse into their day to day lives, walking through the streets and allies, allowing the viewer to see Havanna's real life and beautiful, but decaying buildings.

It is great Spanish listening practice and will also be a great supplement for music teachers as it exposes students to an authentic, old style of music that was nearly extinct until Ry Cooder recruited these great forgotten musicians and made the Buena Vista Social Club album.

This movie takes you back in time and into the magic of Cuba, it's beautiful music and incredibly resilient people who turn to music in order to cope with their sad reality.

It is well organized, and told in such a way that made my heart melt, falling in love with the characters.

I strongly recommend this product for personal enjoyment and as a teaching aid.",1458950400,5,1474,4.852589641434263
1248880,5,B0000203Y5,"This was absolutely joyous! I loved the views of Cuba (as Ry drove around with his son) which gave more meaning to the music. The interviews with the musicians were wonderful! The music was wonderful! It's amazing that some of these musicians were 90 years old and still so active. It was mentioned that Ruben G. (pianist) hadn't played in 10 years! [His single CD is superb]. Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo, Elias Ochoa, Omaura Portuondo (? spelling) - can't decide which if these singers I enjoyed the most. See the movie and buy the soundtrack.

Amazon,  you're really loosing the plot on your DVD's .

Right around the same time I ordered a Meryl Streep DVD ""House of Spirits""  it came to me in a formatted DVD ""region code 2"" which can only  play in Middle East,  Europe, Greenland, etc....  (Only  ""region one""  can play in the USA )  I sent back the unplayable DVD and the replacement came back to me with the same unplayable ""region 2"" again!!

That Ry Cooder could research these artists, then bring them together, then somehow get them out of Cuba for a U.S. tour, is a wonderful story.

It was instead an assortment of splices from the original with an annoying back and forth from the great musicians at home in Cuba to their appearances in the Amsterdam concert.  The music was interrupted over and over in order to accomplish this oscillation such that you never got to hear a full piece.  What a butchery!  Where is the original?  An especially moving scene, which is missing in the present diced up thing, is a view of the twin towers from the plane window as the great musicians were in a glide path to land in New York.

The cars and building made you feel as though you were back to a place which just felt like home.  I've never been to Cuba, but this story was so moving, so touching, I wanted to be sitting in a little caf sipping tea. I wanted to sit by the beautiful water, and just listen to them play music, and tell their story.  I cannot speak Spanish, but this movie wanted me to learn Spanish, because the artist song with such passion I wanted to know what they were singing.  Just writing this is making me want to put the dvd in the player, and watch right now. This was excellently done, and so moving. I pray I get to visit Cuba one day. That someone will drive me along the road in a 1950's car and let me just listen to this beautiful music as I just watch the ocean as we are driving along and enjoy the scenery.

1248979,5,B0000203Y5,"In 1997, well known guitarist Ry Cooder travelled to Havana in search of famed musicians who had worked the clubs in a pre-Castro era.  One of the great venues of a time that stretched from the 1930's to the 1950's was the Buena Vista Social Club.  He successfully recruited a group of aging musicians including a couple in their 90's.  The result was a Grammy winning album.

Following up a couple years later was this documentary by German director Wim Wenders (""Paris Texas"") with Cooder serving as a guide.  Perhaps surprisingly, the Cuban musicians had aged gracefully and played nearly well as they did in their hey-day.  The heart of the film lies in the individual stories of each artist.  Some remembering even touring in the U. S.  Yet, they knew little of the outside world, living on the crumbling island.  The aging Social Club itself now houses young gymnasts and dancers.

Each of the featured performers is vibrant and interesting to listen to.  Cooder and his associates even get approval to take the ensemble on a brief tour, beginning in Amsterdam and ending up at Carnegie Hall, in New York City.  What a great night that must have been.  Wenders then follows the musicians as they tour Manhattan, bewildered as if they had just stepped on another planet.  What could have been.",1373587200,,1298,4.762331838565022

1249013,5,B0000203Y5,"If you are looking for something with a focused story, this isn't it, but if you want a glimpse into the rich tradition of Cuban music infused with Havana street scenes, you can't do better. The importance of music in the Cuban culture is evident. You see the cramped housing filled with old furniture, the streets lined with cars from before the 1959 revolution, many rusting and barely operable. Havana is like a car museum that someone neglected. But among all this are the people and their music. Ibrahim Ferrer expresses the character of the Cuban people when he states that if they made ""things"" important in their lives, they would have perished long ago. These musicians are remembered and revered by their people and we get a chance to see the joy that this music gives to those who make it, those who remember it and those who hear it for the first time.",1337817600,,864,4.580645161290323

It is played by a band put together from artists who knew their greatest popularity in those eras, and it's a charmer.  I have fallen in love with all those old dudes ( plus one timeless lady).  Anyone enjoying the cd should also get the video about making the recording and their tour, ending in Carnegie Hall.  It is such a thrill so see those old folks really enjoying themselves in New York.

I want to watch it again when I am more in the mood for this kind of music; all I have in my head these days is Black Sabbath, and the two don't blend.  But the idea of discovering a Cuban Nat King Cole is just incredible to me, and you can see and hear it right there. Amazing.  The scenes of the city are just great.  I want to go to Cuba some day. The intro with the photographer showing off some of his best pictures (Fidel Castro at the Lincoln Memorial, which was called ""David and Goliath"" is just great propaganda) is just fantastic documentary-making.",1314316800,,713,4.144927536231884

These men and women are over 80 years old and yet they are performing and traveling throughout the world to showcase their music.  Above all, it's a humbling story of life growing up in Cuba.  It illustrates how financial wealth comes last in the waterfall of the important things in life.  Making music and enjoying friendship is what it's all about.  It's impossible not to be enchanted by the scenery in Cuba.  This is definitely worth owning and if you like their music there are several musical albums worth owning as well.",1306195200,2,635,4.675675675675675

The film's perspectives give a true natural sense of the country and it's musical roots. * Try to purchase the DVD separately (1 disc) because the music CD does not reflect all of the music from the film and contains only 5 songs.

1249035,5,B0000203Y5,"I showed this to my family, which has zero experience about Cuba, and they absolutely loved it.  It gave them a nice perspective on Cuban life, music, and the people living there.  For those unfamiliar with Cuba, this film will give them a brief glimpse into life on the island so close to the United States, but yet so isolated from the US.  I had just returned from a visit to the island, so I was excited to see famous landmarks that I had visited while there.

The filmmaker (Wim Wenders) wisely stays away from mixing politics into the film aside from presenting photographs of Fidel Castro during the Revolution, but does not bring up opinions or an agenda to the film.  The famous image of Che is only presented as a painting on the walls of Havana, but he is neither glorified nor vilified.

I haven't even spoke of the music yet.  Artists such as Compay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa, Omara Portuondo and many others grace this film with their beautiful voices and their amazing talents.  Each of the 10 or so artists has a brief moment to present their work and explain a little of their life, while Wim Wenders masterly mixes their solo work into the concert in Amsterdam and the Buena Vista Social Club performance at Carnegie Hall.

I had enjoy the CD, but had not had the opportunity to watch and enjoy the old timers in the video. Compay Segundo has been a Cuban legend since he first appeared in the scene in the '30s. I had no idea he was still alive. Thanks to Mr. Cooder for giving him a few days of happiness, and sharing him with us one more time. The greates revelations for me though was Rubn Gonzlez at the piano who seemed to have not lost one ounce of his brilliance after all these years even with arthritis and little practice, and Ibrahim Ferrer whose voice kept as fresh as when he was a teenager.

I saw the BVSC live about 6 years ago, and it was one of the most amazing and inspiring performances I have ever seen. The movie is a bit slow in parts, and the music is somewhat brought down by Ry Cooder unfortunately. I have the greatest respect for him as a master guitarist (his other collaborations are outstanding) but here he looks hopelessly out of place as the BVSC chugs on with their amazing brand of rootsy lightness. Cooder sits around producing a melancholy wail once in a while from his slide guitar, and that's about it. Pity.

He was an excellent teacher and that memory made me curious about this movie. This gathering of semi-retired musicians still has so much soul and if you don't get goose bumps at least once you are probably tone deaf.

All those well skilled musicians are object of our affection in the right measure of the simple life they used to live. Maybe this can explain it. The video is great and the steadycam has played an important role in the final result - the ballet and gym exercises. As they were about to perform that concert at the Carnegie Hall, they became astonished by the huge appearance of  the city. Instead, it was for the city to surrender to their huge virtuose.

1249096,4,B0000203Y5,"This is a documentary about the famous musicians who played at the Buena Vista Social Club, which has long disappeared, in pre-revolutionary Havana. Apparently guitarist Ry Cooder decided to execute his plan in the late 90's, what he had conceived while visiting Cuba in the 70's, to make an album with these long forgotten folk artists.

Why were these men (and one woman) forgotten? I suppose the U.S.led effort to isolate Cuba since 1959 has played a role in that which has given the regime an excuse for most of its history to frown upon and repress artistic expression that goes beyond its narrow parameters. The regime has placed supreme emphasis on building an economy separate from the U.S. led capitalist world and attempting to survive in a hostile world instead of encouraging artists.

The film displays the picturesque streets of Havana and their denizens watching the scenery from balconies or doorways, playing dominoes, riding in old cars, busses and motorcycles, with lots of stray dogs, including one defecating in the street. But most of all it shows the Cuban musicians reflecting on their life and, of course, playing their charming folk music.

The climax of the film is the group playing at Carnegie Hall in New York. It is certainly moving to see the look on the face of the old vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer as he gets a standing ovation. Several of them are followed through New York as they tour the sites and express enchantment at the great splendor of the city (""Wait till they get mugged,"" my dad said).

A movie like this is good for it shows the human face of Cuba, instead of Cuba viewed through abstract discussions on socio-political or geo-political theories or through the prism of South Florida half-wits who admire Luis Posada Carrilles and Orlando Bosch. The old men (and the one woman) in it are very charming. Compay Segundo is the oldest one in the movie, about 90, at the time of the shooting. He is also probably the most colorful; he discourses on his cure for hangovers, his love of women and his desire to add a sixth to his five children before he dies. As Anne Louise Bardach mentions in her fine new book ""Cuba Confidential"" Segundo tried to play a concert in South Florida in the late 90's but it was disrupted by the usual riots and bomb threats stimulated by talk radio demagogues that happen every time a Cuban musician tries to play in Florida and refuses to defect. As I was impressed with during my visit to the island in January 2004, Cuba is full of people who live, work, play, cry, make love, just like everybody else. It's regime is brutal but it is not North Korea.

The regime seems to have gotten past its cultural Puritanism that devastated Cuba's artistic world during the ""cultural revolution"" of the 60's. Hip hop clothing and rap are flourishing in the country; one can see them and all the latest pop music from Latin America at the night clubs. There is more leeway for artists to express themselves.  When I was in Cuba on a school trip, we visited a ""special"" high school, a training school for ""teachers of culture."" I can't remember exactly where it was located, but it was full of serious young people. We were treated to a solo vocalist or two and an excellent guitar duet. We saw several excellent music performances from different groups in the rest of our trip. Cuban music is alive and well.",1102464000,6,3369,4.672849915682968

I loved the music and since I've never been to Havana or Cuba, the video section of Ry and his son putting along on their motorcycle thru the city's streets to the recording studio were wonderful background for me.
Am I going to quit searching for Cuban / Latin music because I ""found"" Buena Vista Social Club? Hell no... I'm looking for more!! Does Ry Cooder's steel guitar work blend in with the Cuban sounds? Ahhh... Who cares? How much Gerry Garcia / Jimi Hendrix crap did we have to listen to... to get to the meat of their talent?

The documentary style and the scenes of streetlife in Havana are also very colorful and entertaining,
However I must agree with some of the other reviewers that there is something off about Ry Cooder. I respect him for bringing this wonderful music and these artists the recognition they deserve but his attititude on film does seem strange and his guitar playing does not fit with some of the tunes. At one point he is performing with Rueben Gonzalez , the great Cuban pianist, and he sounds so out of place. In fact Gonzalez looks up from the keyboard with a look on his face that seemed to me to be saying.""what are you doing?""
I guess Cooder might have made the choice to let the music of Cuba speak for itself and just be content to film it but he chose instead to feature himself too frequently for my taste.
That aside , this is still a fine documentary and a must for anyone who enjoys latin music.",1074988800,2,1152,4.516746411483253
1249109,5,B0000203Y5,"If you have never been to Cuba, this is a mildly amusing documentary about a chapter in the history of carribean music. If, however,  you have walked through the neigborhood of Buena Vista on 70th Street in La Habana or watched the sun go down from the Malecn at the mouth of the Rio Almendares this film will make your mouth go dry and your eyes water. Vim Wenders and Ry Cooder, quite by accident discovered a cache of musicians who had played in  the forties in a Cabaret called the Buena Vista Social Club that is now long gone. They have common characteristics, they are old, they were forgotten and they were and are incredibly gifted. Some have now died in their eighties and nineties. They were rescued and recorded in the nick of time. The film is apolitical and was shot digitally without apology. The CD from the sound track sold gozillions of copies and raised the export of Cuban music and musicians to be a world treasure. The type of music is called ""son"" and arose from the Danzon (the big dance) of the early part of the century. Played by three to six musician with uncomplicated instruments, you get to meet each of them individually. Collectively, son is ""guajiro"" or country boy music. The stars, including Compay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa and the charming Ibrahim Ferrar will become perpetually embedded in your memory. Until this country comes to its senses you will be deprived of the experience of this touching world, but until then you can enjoy it vicariously at the Buena Vista Social Club.",1074384000,5,1516,4.652985074626866
1249110,3,B0000203Y5,"A fairly enjoyable musical travelogue -- saved mostly by the high quality of the music itself -- but I expected more. Wenders treats everything kind of superficially -- each musician gets to say about a paragraph about his/her life and music on camera. Ibrahim Ferrer, the defacto star of the movie, gets a bit more face time, but he seems like such a fascinating character and I don't really feel that the audience gets to know him.
The movie needs a story, a thread going all the way through. We know that Cooder rediscovered some of these guys, and that there used to be this Buena Vista Social Club, but we don't get a good sense of it. What history there is is usually done in voice over, often with music playing at the same time, so it's hard to take in the information.
Cooder gets annoying sometimes as well -- his guitar style doesn't always fit in, and there's something irritating and a condescending about the way he relates to the other musicians.
Still, worth seeing, especially in the US, where we rarely get a good look at Cuban life.",1073606400,12,1051,4.507853403141361

I don't feel like I really got to know the artists, although there are some nice moments (when they are exploring New York comes to mind), it is mostly abbreviated footage from concerts and recording sessions along with some brief interviews with the performers. It shows some very flavorful images of Cuba, but I couldn't help thinking about how much money Ry Cooder must have made off of these amazingly talented musicians! He seems very aloof in the parts that show him. My biggest disappointment: I was hoping for uncut footage of the concerts, but we only get two or three uncut songs. The ""El Cuarto de Tula"" concert at Carnegie hall that plays during the credits is fantastic, but this DVD needs either more documentary or more music! It is somewhere in between.

A travelogue of Havana locales? Well, ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is all those movies wrapped in one, but only one problem--it's not long enough to carry them all. Maybe it was meant as an introduction to the music, so that if you liked it, you could seek it out on your own. Either way, it's really unfortunate that there isn't a single complete song anywhere in the movie, and sequences like the one with Ry Cooder and his son riding through Havana on a motorcycle cannot serve any purpose.
Another bone to pick--most DVDs these days come with hours upon hours of extras, usually useless crap scraped off the editing room floor. One would think, then, that the producers of this DVD would try to fill in the gaps and put in the complete concert and studio performances that were captured. More likely, they'll wait a while, then try to push a 2-DVD set, then a 3-DVD remastered collector's edition, then a 4-DVD...

1249126,3,B0000203Y5,"If there's any disappointment with ""Buena Vista Social Club,"" it's that the film frequently gets in the way of its subject. We see enough of the Havana streets with their pre-Castro corroding American cars and of the dilapidated grand old architecture to want to see more. Are these images--a kind of ""urban pastoral""--truly representative of the city, or have they been carefully selected for their ripe, romantic decadence? And we hear enough of the music to wish complete exposure if not immersion in its charms. How would it sound without interruptions--by either the intrusion of Wenders' hyperactive cinematic style or the musical presence of the Cooders (father and son)? But Wenders' perpetual-motion camera runs multiple gyres around each subject and edits at a equally frantic pace, obviously assuming the viewer would not sit still for a minute of music unenhanced by visual gymnastics (this must be the unsteadiest Sony ""steadycam"" ever to appear in a film). And if Cuba has indigenous guitarists and trap drummers, Cooder apparently was unable to locate them.
I came to this film after being captivated by the similar ""Calle 54."" This too is a film that frequently calls attention to itself through busy editing and frequent camera movement. The difference, however, is that ""Calle 54"" approaches each performance with a primary regard for the music itself. Each musical number is complete, and there is never any doubt that a first priority is to capture the sound of the music with the fullest fidelity possible. As a consequence, the music itself takes up residence in the spectator's consciousness, complemented but not replaced by the accompanying images. ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is more about the covering of an event (the release of the Grammy-winning recording and its aftermath) than the event itself. The musicians and their music deserved better.",1055894400,5,1872,5.201986754966887
1249127,5,B0000203Y5,"Directed by the german director Wim Wenders, THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB has received the 1999 best european documentary award. And please, take my word for granted, this movie deserves it. And more. Forget Martin Scorsese's THE LAST WALTZ and visit THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB !
In 1998, the well-known american guitarist Ry Cooder decides to go to Cuba and to record his new CD with cuban musicians. After a few days in the island, he discovers that a certain number of the musicians who made the Cuban sound of the 1930's and the 1940's are still alive. Hypnotized by these legends like Ibrahim Ferrer and Compay Segundo, he produces the record THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB with these old guys and organizes two concerts with them, one in Amsterdam and the other at the Carnegie Hall, in New-York.
These concerts, along with the studio sessions in La Havana, are the spine of the movie. Interviews with the members of this one-and-only record group in their homes, visits of the heart of La Havana are also going to capture your heart. I'm not a specialist of central america music but I was profoundly moved by these old timers who are certainly the fathers of a great part of what we are listening today.
One can also feel the respect of Wim Wenders before these men and women who have preferred to stay, poor and forgotten, in their beloved island, rather than to seek fortune in the U.S.A.
Oh yes ! I forgot. The music and the songs are wonderful. Extras are great, so is the quality of the images and the sound. Attention DVD Empire : it's a widescreen format (1:66). Overall, the DVD deserves the perfect 5.

I love the CD, I am a big fan of the music and even play it, yet the over-use of the StediCam (a camera mounting device that allows for smooth, steady camera operation of a hand-held camera) is at times dizzying.
Lastly, at times they pay little attention to the music.  Some of the scenes (such as the piano player with the ballet class) are contrived.  One can only imagine what it was like to be interviewed as the camera person circled you endlessly.
I am so disappointed by this DVD that all I can say is buy the CD and forget this film was ever made.  The only reason I don't give it a ""1"" is because that's unfair.

To interrupt such magic as heard and performed in this film is just as sacrilege.  There is a particular mood to Cuban music that lifts you up and puts you in another state.  You are lost in movement and colour.  You become a drum, a trumpet, a guitar.  You get out of your chair and dance and hug the air.  Then like some incessant commercial break you are jarred back into reality.  It's SO annoying!  Not to mention that it's hard to really listen to what they are saying when there are still traces of clouds in your brain (ever try to follow a conversation when you're drunk or high?).  Don't get me wrong, I love the interviews, and the scenery and the whole flavour of this film!  I just would have preferred it if Wenders had paid tribute to these performers by letting the music speak its language, then separately, at the beginning or the end, tacked on the interviews and other stuff.  Or at least let two or three songs play through at a time.  I know, there's always the CD one can listen to all the way, but the energy cast off by these performers as you watch them is integral to the music.  That's why people go to see live performances.

They tell their own stories during interesting interviews.

If you are not Cuban, you will still love this item for its musical and historical value. The songs trace geographical, social, cultural and historic pictures of Cuba. Ibrahim walks the streets of New York with the admiration and respect that we Cubans feel for USA. The unique smooth, soothing voices, melodies and Caribbean rhytms fuse to create a documentary (or CD if you buy the CD) of a quality that has never been produced before and that will be difficult to surpass.

One on Cuba would be facinating but the addition of the histories, lifestyles, and opinions of the members of the BVSC in one DVD makes for an eye-opening, humbling view of the artistically-honed Cuban muscians. You visit their homes, meet their loved ones, see Cuba from their eyes. The differences between Americans and Cubans is impressive. To watch this DVD is to become more intimately aquainted with peace with one's self, humility, and humor about life. It rounds out the music disc in ways that are impossible to describe -- perhaps something like having a frank, private two-hour conversation Sinatra then having front row tickets and observing him sing. Just replace Sinatra with Ferrer. If you like BVSC, the making of it will touch and delight you -- and possibly much more imporantly -- make you grateful for the small things in life.

1249150,1,B0000203Y5,"Yes, I saw the movie. I had reveled in music like this on another compilation titled 'Cuba Classics: Dancing with the Enemy'. But the movie destroys the sense of how these musicians rhythmically mesh with and play off of each other.
This is not sopping-wet-with-ego rock music, for Pete's sake! This is genuine virtuoso Cuban dance music, but Cooder and his crew, when isolating each individual musician, decided to turn down the volume of all the other parts! How ridiculous! There were only a very few short segments when you get to hear how the ensemble actually sounds like. I mean, what's the point?
Many of the instruments (such as the piano) which are used almost exclusively as melodic/harmonic instruments in our culture are more engaged in for their rhythmic propensities in Cuba and Africa. Isolating them like this completely kills the sense that this is music.
And then oftentimes when the whole ensemble is playing, the engineer dials in so much reverb that it muddies up the mux. Again, you lose the sense of what Cuban music is, and how it sounds. What right do these guys have to make roots music sound something like reverb-drenched heavy metal? There's a difference between freedom of speech and free dumb of screech!

I was very surprized a couple of years after the movie to be in a coffee shop here in town and hear some absolute kick-butt old-style Cuban music playing on their stereo. I asked what it was, and found that it was the the original 'Buena Vista Social Club' CD compilation which came out sometime prior to the movie and inspired it. This CD did not have the problems at all that came with the later video/movie, at least not the cuts I got to listen to.
Note that if you don't know this type music very well, the documentary parts of the movie are excellent . . . probably at least 4 stars for that, probably more.",1017014400,12,1851,4.62613981762918
1249151,5,B0000203Y5,"This movie is about the reunion of a group of musicians that had flourished in the Golden Era of Cuban music, but that had faded away into anonymity after decades of changes in musical taste among the public.
There was, however, someone who had not forgotten these legends of Cuban music. Ry Cooder, who had heard their recordings two decades before but had never met them personally, had the idea of going to Cuba to find them all and get them back together and have the chance to play with them to produce new recordings. Little did he know what a phenomenon his idea would become. They went on to win a Grammy for one of their records, and toured Europe with sold-out performances in venues of the caliber of the Vienna opera house. I quote Wim Wenders (the director) from an interview with Charlie Rose: ""I mean, they were in Vienna at the opera house, and they had a standing ovation, Rubn and Ibrahim, for 20 minutes. Never happened in the history of the Viennese opera house. Even Richard Strauss didn't get that sort of applause.""
The movie, which was originally intended to be a documentary, combines the reenactments of some of the moments when they first met with Ry Cooder, and intertwines them with scenes from life in every-day Cuba and interviews with selected members of the newly formed group. It also includes scenes from their performance in Amsterdam and their visit to New York City to perform at the Carnegie Hall. Their music serves as a central theme that provides a smooth continuity to the flow of the movie.
This movie captures not only a great story of a group of musicians that resurfaced from shoe-shining to shining-stars, but also the heart of a nation that has lived in isolation for over four decades. You learn how the wealth of a nation can not always be measured in terms of money. Cuba is indeed a very wealthy nation.",1015545600,2,1856,4.610271903323262

Americans rarely get to see Cuba, much less experience its rich culture and music (as we once did), and this DVD gives you the opportunity to do both. I have shown it to my students just to give them some perspective. I believe this is not only an emnjoyable film, but is also important.
The music itself stands alone and is undeniably excellent. After watching this film, my appreciation for cuban jazz multiplied. I saw Buena Vista Social Club perform in Atlanta over the summer in 2001 and their music was heavenly.
I highly recommend this DVD, whether you are familiar with the music or not. After watching it, you will want more of this music. ...And possibly even a glimpse of Havana for yourself!",1011657600,,864,4.616883116883117

If not, I'll hopefully give you just an idea of how incredible this truly is.  It is a pretty tough thing to do however, for words do not adequately capture the feeling.
Something to try...get a good cigar.  Try a nice Ashton, Dunhill, Victor-Sinclair, H. Upmann, Punch, or...if you have good sources,  or crafty customs techniques, an always incredible Cohiba.  Next, pour yourself a very good glass of rum, on the rocks.  Any adult beverage will do, but this one just sets well with the cigar and the atmosphere.  Then, open all your windows.  True, this only works well if you are in a decent latitude.  Next, pop in this dvd.  Enjoy.
This is pure beauty.  I discovered the BVSC many years ago, and after first having purchased the BVSC cd, I was COMPELLED to get everything I could get my hands on.  So, along came the releases from Compay, Ibrahim, Omara, Cachaito, Rueben, Afro-Cuban All Stars, etc.  I purchased each and every one, as well as all the subsequent releases.  Compay for instance now has 3 out.  Reuben has 2.  Afro-Cuban have 2 as well.  And a blessing it is.  I pray they continue to pour out the releases.
This DVD is the PERFECT visual companion to the cd.  It causes one to FEEL the music that much more.  To know that these are musicians who LIVE what they sing.  They KNOW it.  They are still living in it.  The documentary allows you to become that more a part of what you are hearing.  Then, once you watch this, when you listen to the cd's, you feel that much closer to it and it's much more a part of your soul.
It's a dvd filled with concert footage and behind the scenes recording footage.  It's filled with images and interviews on the streets of old Cuba....perhaps that's a bit redundant.  At any rate, it looks like, amidst the crumbling buildings and streets, like Cuba is frozen in time.  Ever since the day of the embargo, things haven't changed.  This is incredibly wonderful and incredibly painful at the same time.
Definitely get this dvd.  Definitely get all the cd's you can.  Be careful of BVSC imitators out there however.  As many others have tried to cash in on these artists.  However, be on the lookout for the many artists that actor Andy Garcia is working with and releasing on cd.  He is, remarkably, an incredible trumpet player and is taking painstaking efforts to preserve the same musical heritage as is here.  Also, anything in the ""Cubanismo"" series is without fault.  Definitely worth looking into.
Now, definitely try to act out what I have set forth above.  Add to it a Guyaberra shirt (in your favorite color) and a dancing partner.  Then, roll back the rug on the terrazo floors, and enjoy life.",1008115200,,2775,4.555780933062881

Without the energy and commitment of Producer / Director / Everything Cooder this project would never have been realized. Thanks for that--but therein is the rub and therein lies the source of my discomfort. Thanks to ""Ry"" for the good stuff--the chance to see and hear great players and great music. Good grief the faces, the environment, the humanity of the musicians. They are wonderful. They are there to see.  However, you should know that Cooder as the visting ""musician"" and his son, I believe, ""the visiting drummer"" have almost hobbled the musicality and uninhibited creative musical sense of the project. Ry Coody is a well-intentioned goody two-shoes folky type with no real sense of time (especially in Latin music)and harmonic sense. He is well-intentioned white bread. The instrument he plays is in and of itself an incumbrance. The slide guitar or whatever the damned thing is called is rarely in good tune to begin with. His lack of sensitivity in phrasing and selection of chord changes and the god-awful horrible generic sound of the instrument itself are almost unforgiveable instrusions. Cooder's son, who plays the set or, the ""traps"" as I am sure he is hip enough to refer to in insider conversation, is the epitome of the doted-upon son with bar mitzvah drum set. The younger Cooder should have been playing and paying his dues with a Miami Beach ""social"" two-step rhumba band instead of intruding upon musical outings with the some of the finest, most sound-conscious players (any school, etc.) on the planet. Think of Bird playing with the Monkees (the group). Get the picture? It is uncomfortable yet fascinating, e.g., to watch the great timbales player and the great bass player wince and try to control their on-stage actions when imported drummer and producer, etc. ""guitarist"" Cooder are playing. Is it any wonder that Cooder and son are playing in close musical and physical proximity during early meetings at sessions and in early studio situations and then end up at the climactical concert in Carnegie Hall on risers conveniently about as out of sight and mind as the real artists can place them. It's a musical embargo! Yikes.  So why buy the Buena Vista Social Club? Because it is difficult to get examples of great Cuban music anywhere else. This DVD is definitely worth the price and the space in any collection of fine music. But Mr. Cooder--next time--if there is a next time, please don't play. You're not a good enough a musician to play in fast company--any school, any era, any time--and unfortunately, you and your son, the drummer, defile albeit unintentionally -- that which you wish to honor, immortalize and celebrate. Buy the recording; overlook and put the ""musical"" contributions of the Cooders out of your consciousness and then the Buena Vista Social Club becomes a must-own.

1249174,5,B0000203Y5,"When this documentary was being filmed in 1998, the CD which was issued in 1997 had just been released and went on to win a Grammy.  It had been the result of American guitarist Roy Cooder's determination to  bring the musical sounds of Cuban music to the public.  He then brought on the German movie director, Wim Wenders, to capture on film the music, the people and Cuba itself.
The musicians are elderly, their musical skills developed from childhood and they are living memorials to the music they love.  Once renowned in Cuba in the 40's and 50's, these men have lived through upheaval and changes in their country, and yet approach life with joy and freshness.  The camera picks up the wrinkles, but it also picks up the twinkle in the eye of 91 year old guitarist/singer Compay Segundo who playfully talks about fathering another child to add to his family, or lead singer 70 year-old Ibraham Ferrer's affection for this wife, the 80-year old pianist Ruben Gonzolez who finds it hard to walk, but has no trouble making his fingers fly over the keyboard. Omera Portuando, the lone sultry female, adds an ageless feminine presence to the group.
This is not just a movie about the music.  The movie IS the music.  And there are long musical sequences which will delight anyone with a serious musical interest.  The movie is also about the individual people, whose interviews against the backdrop of a crumbling, but lively Cuba are testaments to the human spirit.  Before they were rediscovered  for this film, one of the men was shining shoes;  another was working in a cigar factory.  Politics are never mentioned, but the 1940s and 50s American cars and the disintegrating buildings is evidence of politics gone haywire four decades ago.
The movie culminates with a concert in Carnegie Hall and the musicians' first trip to New York.  Their sense of wonder in viewing the skyscrapers, looking at store windows and visiting the Empire State Building is a sharp contrast to the confines of their restricted world in Cuba, which is nevertheless rich with the spirits of this indomitable individuals.
The video does lack dramatic tension, and drags in places, but I still don't hesitate to recommend it.  It spite of poverty and a humble economy, the movie captures the beauty and joy of the people.  And it surrounds you with music.",977011200,47,2337,4.8075
1249175,5,B0000203Y5,"In 1956, the U.S. Navy sent me to Key West, Florida.  I'd always been a radio junkie, so it didn't take me long to discover Radio Havana.  For a year in Key West, and then for two years in Bermuda, I enjoyed what was to me a new and spectacular music from Havana.  And now, 44 years later, Wim Wenders has brought those very same sounds, from the very same people, flooding back to me like a reborn life.  Over the years I'd forgotten the authentic sound I'd heard from Radio Havana when in Key West.  But from the opening downbeat of the film it was as if I'd been transported back in time, listening and watching the same musicians I'd heard in the Fifties, when they were in their prime and heard regularly on Radio Havana.  I've remained a Latin music fan over the years, but the sound you'll hear in this video is different; it's authentic, the real thing, a more romantic approach to what we now call Salsa. The film is a social documentary as well as a musical one, giving us hidden glimpses into life in Cuba.  Life there is more than we may have  thought. A look into the hearts and lives of these sweet artists offers exceptional and surprising insight into the potential of human nature.  ""The way of possessions"" has been rejected, and has given them the strength of character to ""resist the good as well as the bad.""  If you aren't in tears--with feet tapping--at the triumph of these beautiful people as they are resurrected to thunderous applause at Carnegie Hall, then you simply aren't paying attention.",969840000,23,1520,4.494545454545454
1249176,5,B0000203Y5,"Ry Cooder struck gold when he stumbled upon these Cuban musical legends  understandably forgotten by the outside world but somehow forgotten in  their own country.  With instruments and forms of music virtually  unaffected by 40 years of pop culture, these superlative musicians will  warm you with their humility and their affection for each other and their  culture, and then thrill you will their rich music.  Cooder, however, did  the musicians a disservice by giving himself and his son such a big  role  in the project.  Cooder's electric guitar doesn't work when it is mixed  with thick, natural sound of the Cuban musicians.  Director Win Wenders  shot a brilliant sequence when legendary pianist Ruben Gonzalez is working  magic on his piano and Cooder interjects with his electric guitar.  Wenders  moves the camera amongst the Cuban musicians while Cooder is playing and  they all have perplexed looks on their faces.  It is a sound that they  obviously are not accustomed to and one that clashes with their natural  sounds.  It's also painful to watch Cooder's son head and shoulder  movements while he plays percussion -- it's something straight out of a  Wayans brother movie.
I don't want to seem ungrateful.  Full credit goes  to Cooder for what he has done for these performers and the music world.  These performers obviously have deep affection for Cooder.  Stepping back  and the letting the legends go would have been the right thing to do.  Instead, he looks like George Plimpton.

To be sure, the music is  excellent (though the recording quality on the DVD is far from  concert-quality), played with the passion one expects of artists who know  that music is their best form of free expression. But the DVD provides  more: the trip to NYC of these gentlemen and the chance to watch them watch  us is priceless.

I found the music to be greatly alive in Cuba and  it was about the best part of experiencing this country.  Other than that,  I found the country to be quite interesting, and the great thing was that  the Cuban people had nothing against us Americans personally, it was mostly  the government.

Just like with other Wenders's movies, it is hard to define  what ""Buena Vista"" is really about.  Is it about Cuba and its  lifestyle?  Yes, but not only that.  Is it about Cuban music?  Of course,  but there is something more to it.  It is the atmosphere in the movie that  I absolutely loved.  The music, also the players and singers of the  ""son de Cuba"" are alive.  Thier dedication to each other and,  maybe more importantly, to the music is unique.  ""Buena Vista Social  Club"" is real, and you have to see it and feel it to truely  understand.

Reknown musician and singer Ry Cooder sits back as  Dream Team coach and lets this long forgotten talents of cuban music tell  him naturally their stories, like Ibrahim Ferrer's recording debut at age  72 or Compay Segundo's 90 year old romance intentions. The heartwarming  side of this film probably is the chance that this very talented singers  and musicians have to fulfill every musician's dream concert: full house  attendance at the legendary Carnegie Hall and Amsterdam. They also get to  know the Big Apple and display child-like innocence and awe.  One of the  mayor acheivements of the film is how Wim Wenders blends the cuban studio  and city shots with the actual concerts in N.Y. and Amsterdam. This is Not  a concert though. All the songs are blended with interviews or Havanna  scenaries. The video quality is very good, but don't expect IMAX or so. The  sound quality is impecable and there are some extras (a couple of full  songs).

Some of the numbers would be considered old standards for those of us of  latin backgrounds who grew up hearing our mothers/fathers or grandparents  singing them.  For jazz lovers worldwide it is a chance to appreciate the  influence of cuban and afro cuban music in jazz.

1249200,5,B0000203Y5,"I think most people who loved the CD, will find that this filmed rendition will take their experience one step further.  This fine film documents Ry Cooder's initiative to gather some of Cuba's finest musicians and create an  album.  ""Buena Vista Social Club"" allows us a glimpse into the  lives of the musicians, and a haunting tour of run down Havana, a city  longing to be rediscovered as the musicians were. Viewers get a taste of  the passion behind the music, as well as the environment out of which these  masters emerge.
Documentaries have a tendency to turn their subjects into  to museum pieces, whereas this film draws us into its sultry rhythms and  quiet passions.
I would strongly recommend this film to those who  desire a good introduction to Caribbean/Latin music but don't want to get  overwhelmed in a sea of repetitive 'merengue' or 'salsa.'  This is the real  thing, played by human beings who know how to keep rhythm because rhythm is  at the very core of their beings.  Those who have access to the DVD format  will maximize their enjoyment of this presentation.  Having additional  material only available on DVD, such as concert footage and musician  information, is like being at a Cuban fiesta where one has a lot of choice  between fine food, excellent drink, and exquisite music.",948153600,15,1308,4.806306306306307

The music is  masterful, including cuban greats like Ruben Gonzalez, Omara Portuondo,  Ibrahim Ferrer, Elciades Ochoa and Compay Segundo (all of whose CDs I have  ofcourse), not to mention others.  These musicians live ""music""  and let us know in every way how music is an essence in their living and  how it can become one, with us in any corner of the world. Whether it is a  bolero, son or trova the movie brings Cuba's soul to you.  Characters and  music blend in one to tell a story that again, is simply life  itself.
Buena Vista Social Club is a must buy movie, not only because it  celebrates one of the best birth spots of latin music, but because it  teaches us perfection and achievement through the enjoyment of all those  little things that we love to do the most.
pd: On the 28th Buena Vista  Social Club will visit Puerto Rico. ""I will be there !""

Who ever sees this film can't help but develop the highest  esteem for all the musicians represented and Ibrahim Ferrer in Particular.  Omara Portuondo's duo with him, sung with such emotion and passion as to  bring tears to her eyes, captivates the viewer and gives him goosebumps as  the tears come to his eyes too.

Of course, he had all the help he could  get, in the so human faces of these old and forgotten but happy musicians.  It's been a lesson for all of us in the developed countries: money and fame  aren't always necessary to find and keep the soul. Compay and Ibrahim give  a lecture of beauty and life.

The  director captures every tender moment in such a way that takes the viewer  from the political-cultural climate of Cuba through the personal-familial  moments of each and every member of the Buena Vista Social Club band. The  viewer comes away from this visual-musical treat longing to hug every  musician in the film.

1249213,5,B0000203Y5,"I could have stayed to watch Buena Vista Social Club all day and all night. The film traces master guitarist Ry Cooder's seemingly endless search for more musical legends to play with, as he takes us to Cuba to  meet the masters of ""Son"" music. The result is a warm, beautiful  and touching portrait of the aging  ""Son"" masters emerging from a  long hiatus to show us they haven't lost their touch.
Cooder has long  sought out masters of ""roots"" music to learn from and play with.  This time he found his way into a diamond mine, and the resulting three  albums, ""Buena Vista Social Club"", ""Afro-Cuban  All-Stars"" and ""Introducing Ruben Gonzales"" could all have  won the 1998 Grammy award, as the former actually did.
The film follows  the aging Son musicians around their native Cuba as they prepare for  overseas concerts in both Holland and New York City. The city of Havana  shows the effects of aging itself, run down and seedy, but, as with the  musicians themselves, there is a spirit of unity and inner strength that  overrides the worn down facade. That spirit emerges quickly as you see how  deeply the Cubans feel their music. You also see a country that preserves  the old and makes it work personified in the ""antique""  automobiles the Cubans use to get around.
Several musicians are featured  in the film, but two gain the film's focus, jazz pianist Ruben Gonzales and  singer Ibrahim Ferrer, the ""Cuban Frank Sinatra"". Gonzales no  longer has a piano and plays one in a gymnasium reserved for Cuban  gymnasts. Ferrer feels the public no longer appreciates his music and is  shining shoes to supplement a tiny retirement. Ry Cooder and his son  Joachim (sp?), a talented drummer, try to stay as far in the background as  possible. Cooder's style is to sit at the feet of the masters to learn and  participate. I think the director, Wim Wenders, gives him more face time  than he would prefer. No matter, as he is a wonderful musician and  facilitator, without whom the original project and the film would not have  happened.
Wenders weaves the music and the life of the musicians in a  pattern that draws the audience into the lives of the musicians, especially  Ferrer. I was very familiar with the music from the three albums and that  made my experience with them almost personal. I was excited as I saw the  rehearsals draw the musicians closer and tighter. They became young again  as the music started flowing from them.
The culmination of the film is  the concert at Carnegie Hall. I was fully engaged by then and I had chills  when the Son music was playing and when the audience responded with such  enthusiasm. I had tears of pleasure as the music flowed over me.
I've  recommended this film to many of my friends, and they all have gone out of  their way to thank me. I don't think I've seen another film in 1999 that  I've liked better. I'll paraphrase what Ry Cooder says to his son in the  film, ""This is the kind of opportunity that comes once in a  lifetime"".",945388800,184,2989,4.595825426944971
