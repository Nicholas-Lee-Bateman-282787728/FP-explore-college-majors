If you've ever heard of Bluewater Productions and the genre of celebrity bio comics like Adam West or Honey Boo Boo, you'll find this interesting, since this is basically the story of it's forefather.",1423872000,,373,4.936507936507937
8508174,4,B0071BY1OM,"Wow, I had no idea that there was this much of a story behind the scenes of these small, indie comics I bought as a kid.  When I saw this DVD at a used record store, my head tilted and I thought ""Really?  They made a movie about this?""  Well, they did, and it's a story worth telling.

Comics were in a boom in the early 90's, and the indy comics were riding the coattails.  A number of indy comics came onto the scene with ""biographies"" of famous names, using those names to boost sales.  What ensued were number of legal battles over copyrights, and a slew of indie writers and artists trying to make it big by getting published.  Being a comic buyer who bought into a lot of this hype at the time, this movie is a fascinating look at what the ""little guys"" were going through and the drama that accompanied their success.

The only gripe I have is that narrative feels a little wishy-washy at times.  Todd Loren (the creator of Rock n Roll Comics) is sometimes portrayed as a brilliant and savvy businessman, and then other times vilified as greedy and arrogant.  This comes mostly from different points of view of the people being interviewed, but it really does seem to bounce around a lot.",1408147200,,1195,4.390909090909091
8508175,5,B0071BY1OM,"I have been a comic book fan since my childhood, thanks to my parents, teachers, and my father's coworkers, who supplied me with them. Good times those were, I must say. However, as I went to college, I drifted apart from most of them, and mostly only read Asterix, which my late father also enjoyed. For some years now, I have returned to reading other titles, including the famous or infamous Rock & Roll comics. I never quite cared about their history; I just read them. However, what a surprise it was when I watched ""The Story of Rock & Roll Comics,"" an intriguing and incredibly informative documentary, directed by Ilko Davidov, about the history of this publication, as well as that of the late Todd Loren, its creator.
One of the things that I didn't know about Rock & Roll comics, and that I learned through this film, is that Todd Loren was brutally assassinated. And that is, precisely, the way the movie opens, with scenes of the media reporting the crime, which occurred in his apartment in San Diego, California, on June 18, 1992.  He was the president of Revolutionary Comics, which published Rock & Roll comics. We then meet Herb Shapiro, Todd's father, and he tells us about his son's younger years, how he began collecting and selling comic books, and how at 18 years old he had enough money to buy a house. These scenes are mixed with video interviews with Todd, in which he also talks about his passion for comics. Some other people who knew him are also interviewed, and they mention that Todd's inspiration for Rock & Roll comics was ""Hey, Boss - a parody of Bruce Springsteen.""
Some of the personnel that worked as either artists or writers interviewed for the film were Spike Steffenhagen, Jay Allen Sanford, Scott Jackson, Robert Conte, among others. There are also interviews with Alice Cooper, who respected the magazine, as well as Andy Verne (attorney for the magazine). They talked about the fights that Todd had with several musicians who felt that the comics were lying about them, and how Todd's character and attitude made him many enemies. Perhaps the most significant legal battle that Todd had was that with New Kids on the Block, which went all the way to court, with the judge deciding in favor of Todd, based on his First Amendments rights. This verdict opened the door for future publishers. Not in vain, the magazine's motto was ""unauthorized and proud of it!""  And Todd really pushed the envelope and used this privilege on that one.
Todd Loren (1960-1992), whose real name was Stuart Shapiro, died very young, at the height of his success, and part of the final moments of the movie speculate about the possible reasons for the murders - it could have been because he was gay, because was at times arrogant and abusive, or because of a car sale deal gone wrong. Perhaps musician Mojo Dixon was correct when he said, ""Rock & Roll is really about two things: `I don't give a [profanity]' or `[profanity]' - that's the spirit that Todd had."" At any rate, Rock & Roll comics are part of history, some of us enjoy them, and that's all that matters. And you can bet you that with time they will be worth some serious money. The DVD includes alternate and extended interviews, TV clips, news stories, and much more. (USA, 2005, color, 84 min plus additional materials)

8508177,4,B0071BY1OM,"This is one of TWO DVD documentaries released this month by Music Video Distributors about modern day ""comic books"". (The other is ""Comic Book Independents"").  While the CBI covers a slew of writers, artists, illustrators, and publishers, R&RC DVD focuses on one publisher - Todd Loren, who ran a music memorabilia mail order business and then a comic book store in San Diego. In 1989 he founded Revolutionary Comics which published unauthorized adventures of rock stars like Bon Jovi, Skid Row, and Guns N' Roses. While his ego was huge (he loved being sued by the musicians and this made him push buttons harder) his story goes beyond the publishing business because he was found stabbed to death in 1992 (he was only 32). The murder was never solved.

Ilko Davidov's 84-minute film is interesting and should appeal to both comic collectors as well as heavy metal and rock fans. I don't count myself among either of these groups but I learned a lot and was entertained for the length of the film. The DVD is loaded with bonuses (as was the Independents DVD). There are over 2 hours of Interviews, Commercials, and a cover art gallery. PLUS there's an eight page booklet of liner notes and illustrations.

A few of the interviewees are the same as in CBI, including Gary Groth (founder of Fantagraphics) and Robert Williams. The big celebrity name here is probably Alice Cooper, and there's lots of archival footage of Loren himself talking to the camera.

By releasing the two DVDs simultaneously Music Video Distributors is giving modern comic book collectors a double shot of entertaining history. And with this one you get an unsolved crime to boot!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
