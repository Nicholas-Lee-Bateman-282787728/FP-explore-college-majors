8655118,4,B00K19TMAY,"If you purchase this DVD be aware that the back of the case may say that the picture format is ""colour PAL 4:3"". When I saw that I wasn't sure whether I should open the packaging and try it or not. Well, I did try on my old PS3 and my new PS4 and this DVD played fine on both. This video is 4:3 and it is not very high quality but it is video from 1987 to 1994 so that is pretty much to be expected.",1413244800,,399,3.5977011494252875
