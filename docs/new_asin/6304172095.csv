7866833,5,6304172095,"""From Beyond: Ghosts"" features reknowned ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren, best known for their investigation in the Amityville Horror case.  The video takes us to some of their favorite haunted sites, as well as a tour of their own collection of items that were once part of a haunting or demonic possession.  Ed Warren, who unfortunatly passed away in 2006, was a lay exorcist and explains the dangers and dimensions of black magic.  The video offers more than stories from the Warrens' lengthy career, (Lorraine is still alive and well and involved in investigation and speaking engagements), we also hear stories and see evidence of others other-wordly experiences.  A definate video to have in one's collection if interested in ghosts and ghost hunters.",1192233600,,762,5.120967741935484

7866836,3,6304172095,"As a purveyor of anything supernatural, I found this video to be a decent account of bizarre phenomena. The video comprises mainly of interviews with witnesses to poltergeist and other behavior. At times the video is of poor  quality to the point where it is hard to see and hear images and voices.  But, the video weaves interesting tales that provide entertainment and  helpful hints for research of this phenomena. A last note is that the video  may only be interesting to those that are truly serious about the  supernatural. This video is not for people who's main purpose to buy is to  frighten themselves or others. With that note....enjoy!",964051200,3,647,4.836363636363636
