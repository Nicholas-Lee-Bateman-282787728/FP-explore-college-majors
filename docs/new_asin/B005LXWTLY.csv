8478772,5,B005LXWTLY,"I give the film a five star, but every movie, documentary we watch through Amazon Prime either stops several times or just disappears. That is one reason I will not pay to have a movie, I did it once and it happened and I won't do it again. I like Amazon Prime, but the movie quality just drives all of us insane. Quality gets zero stars. The film simply great historical information for my children. Thank you. Does anyone else have the same problem? We don't have that problem with Netflix, our TV is not old and neither is our internet.",1469750400,,539,4.346534653465347
