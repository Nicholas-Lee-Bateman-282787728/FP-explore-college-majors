7913246,4,B00000JQA5,"(...)I believe that John Glover fits the character of ThomasStockmann exactly as Arthur Miller envisioned him when he adaptedIbsen's play, and that this is the character that Ibsen created. Stockmann is a scientist and whistle-blower who doesn't see outsidehis sphere of expertise. He doesn't understand the havok his discoveryof pollution at the town's spa will wreak upon the shareholders, thetown officials, the ordinary working people, and even his ownfamily. His passion for saving the people from the pollution, combinedwith his own very human desire to be recognized for this importantdiscovery and his lifelong rivalry with his brother, Mayor PeterStockmann, makes for a very realistic character who is both scientistand fanatic. Who else but John Glover could bring this combination tothe screen so convincingly? The videotape and stage-like sets createthe feel of live drama without this being simply a ""filmedplay,"" and Miller's adaptation is completely true to Ibsen'soriginal. Moved to Maine and set in 1893 instead of 1880's Norway, theaction of the play, and most of the dialogue, are identical in spiritif not always in content. This is an entertaining video that alsoserves as a wonderful accompaniment to a study of the play. Followingthe performance is a brief discussion betweeen Arthur Miller and thefilm's director.",982281600,10,1337,5.5588235294117645
7913247,3,B00000JQA5,I don't need to go into any great detail about the releases of one of my favorite dramas.  The review by Ms. Tupper is one hundred percent accurate.  The McQueen version was wonderful and the lack of critical acclaim was criminal.  The TV version was only mediocre.,969580800,6,265,4.595744680851064
7913248,2,B00000JQA5,"There are two versions of this play by Henrik Ibsen on film in English.  One made in 1977 with Steve McQueen un the starring role of Dr. Stockman, and a 1990 made for TV version, produced for PBS on an adaptation by Arthur  Miller and with John Glover in the role of Dr. Stockman.  The 1977 version  with Steve McQueen is far superior.  In the 1990 version John Glover is  much too hyper.  He is often just plain silly--or even stupid--and he does  not make standing up for truth appear very noble.  Actually, this film  nullifies the entire intent of the play as written by Ibsen in that it  discredits the whole idea of standing up for truth and right.
Steve  McQueen's performance is sensitive to Ibsen's original intent, a very fine  piece of work.
I would strongly recommend that anyone considering  purchase of this film insist on getting the 1997 Steve McQueen version.
I  would have to struggle to give the John Glover version two stars.  For  Steve McQueen I would happily assign five.",956534400,25,994,4.588571428571429
