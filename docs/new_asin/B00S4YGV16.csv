6958697,5,B00S4YGV16,"I recieved this a gift from a friend

Ihave always loved the Saint . Roger Moore played Simon Templar, a man of mysterty,debonar rogue called The Saint..Moore was so cool without being slick. This adventure series was not always a cop show, The Saint played in the world of the rich. The plots of these shows, based upon
the novels, were complexed pieces of Television. You had to watch these shows to get them

These 39 Black & White  episodes of the Saint is classic. This was the 60's..so cell phones and overdone car chases. . You needed to use dialog to bring a point across. This show was more an adventure show, than a poice show

It is worth it, YES totally . What works were the production  value . The scripts were tight and well crafted..It still holds up today

6958698,5,B00S4YGV16,"The first-and best-personification of The Saint on television, these black and white episodes comprising the first two seasons of this British ITV series boast clear transfers and audio, and are sporadically accompanied by commentary from Roger Moore and co-stars.  For those of you who only know Roger Moore from the James Bond films, my advice is to get a frontal lobotomy, order this action-adventure series set in the early 60's, and watch a skilled actor  personify true cool as he travels the globe as a ""reformed"" jewel thief operating inside-and mostly outside-the law to preserve the status quo ante.",1447718400,11,609,5.141414141414141
