8239780,5,B00110ERG6,"This is definitely geared more for intermediate players since it is assumed you pretty much know the chord shapes.  Most you can figure out by watching the playing, but some are still a bit baffling at my level.  Still, I learned a great deal from watching these.  Once you're confortable with something like the Beatles Fake Book, this is a good buy to see how to really play the songs.",1293753600,3,387,4.5
8239781,5,B00110ERG6,"I don't know why people who have absolutely no knowledge of music rate videos of this calibre in the manner they do and then discourage others from buying them with their idiotic two star rating.

THIS DVD IS A GEM. I have been listening to the beatles for over 14 years now and been struggling to find a dvd that offers indepth analysis of all music parts rhythm , lead and even the faintest of background guitars featured to pin point accuracy giving you the original beatle sound.
Rob Taylor has done extensive research on every single track he has instructed and gone to the extent of showing the instructional guitar parts from the original models of guitars that were part of beatle gear. You guys will note by the time rubber soul came out in 1965 beatles switched from Rickenbacker to Epiphone Casino and for a short period of time Fender Stratocaster. in thier live performances they played on the casino but in studio they did use stratocaster for lead parts to Nowhere Man and the rhythm rift to drive my car. these fine tuned details are available on this dvd to get that perfect beatle sound.
yes the guitars played are for people who already know how to play music at intermediate to advanced levels and certainly not for beginners but at the same time keep in mind those who are so anal about getting the right beatle sound on their guitars and playing beatle music to dead on accuracy will require certain amount of skill.
i know beatle cover bands here in new england who have seen this dvd and praised it no ends.
I give it 5 stars based on the content and the knowledge that this dvd presents. i have never seen the split screens featuring upto 4 guitars being played at the same time unravelling the deep secrets of how beatles played songs like Bird can sing and Dear Prudence .",1272326400,11,1799,4.5015290519877675
8239782,2,B00110ERG6,"First let me say that this video is fun to watch. The author knows his stuff. My only issue is that I thought it would be more instructional. I am NOT an experienced guitar player, and I hoped for more slow motion and basics. If you are inexperienced, I don't think this is for you, but you will pickup some pointers that I have not seen anywhere else.",1265500800,,352,4.1911764705882355
8239783,5,B00110ERG6,"A couple weeks ago I ordered teh new Beatles To a tee volume 2 from their site to-a-tee.tv . I can honestly say that it is even better then the first one. They show the chords on the screen,which makes it much easier to learn from. I'm convinced there is no better way to learn Beatles songs unless Paul himself made this same type of video. Personal highlights include I saw here standing there,I'll follow the sun,ticket to ride, nowhere man, Mother Natures son.  The whole selection is just perfect. I think the video just came out because I haven't seen it anywhere but their site.  HIGHLY RECOMENDED!",1034208000,3,605,4.592592592592593
8239784,5,B00110ERG6,"The loving care with which this video was made is easy to see. The instructor pays respectful homage to the Beatles in a way that I have a hunch even the Beatles would enjoy.
Having figured out the guitar parts to these songs myself many years ago (by trial and error while repeatedly listening to the recordings) it was interesting to see how someone else had them figured out. I, like the instructor, have a passion for playing the guitar parts with perfect accuracy to the original. I was surprised and pleased to learn nuances from this video that I'd gotten wrong all these years. It lives up to its name, ""To-a-Tee!""
This video is a joy to watch - it's both educational and entertaining. I imagine that even a non-guitar player would enjoy it because it's fun to listen to, but there's a significant bonus to this video: the clever visual presention is really something special. Hopefully, follow-up videos will be produced in the future.",1026518400,,944,4.692771084337349
8239785,3,B00110ERG6,"The split screen is wonderful, the guitars used are accurate re-issues of the original Beatle instruments, its fun to watch, and the guitar playing is exemplary....but.  This tape DESPERATELY needs printed tablature to go along with it.  I've shown this tape to musicians who are MUCH better players than I am and they all say, ""What, no tab""?!  Its a great addition to my collection of Beatles on VHS, but without the tablature it is extremely ""iffy"" as a learning tool.",1013299200,3,471,4.790123456790123
8239786,4,B00110ERG6,"I purchased this video a while back from to-a-tee-.tv and it was worth every penny.  It's cheaper there too, unless it changed recently. Their website also allows you to watch video clips from the video before you buy it,witch I thought was cool.  I think the split screen presentation is absolutely brilliant!  The parts are played accurately and it's fun to sometimes just sit and watch.  The only thing that i would suggest that might improve this video would be to include tablature because it's sometimes hard to make out exactly what his fingers are doing. Thank goodness for the rewind button.  All and all though, it's well worth the investment to learn the songs (Blackbird, Till There Was You, Her Majesty, Dear Prudence, etc..)that have stifled me for years.  I hope there's more volumes to come.  I give it a 9 out of 10.",1007683200,5,833,4.703448275862069
