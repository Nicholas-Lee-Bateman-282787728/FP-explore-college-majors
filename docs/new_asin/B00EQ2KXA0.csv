There is bound to be something for every one. There may be a few that are ridiculous, but they are part of the fun too.",1400544000,14,257,3.9615384615384617

5934060,3,B00EQ2KXA0,"Glad I got this set. The prints are not the best and could do with some restoration, and a lot of them seem to be thrillers, not horror (But we haven't watched them all yet). The box came with a dent on it, but wasn't too fussed, and there was no mention of the customs charges (27) unless I missed it completely. Recommended to fill in the gaps of your horror collection.",1392249600,,372,4.180555555555555
5934061,1,B00EQ2KXA0,I was excited to see a box set with some a few obscure movies I have been looking for. The box set packaging it very nice. The transfers of the movies to DVD leaves much to be desired. The quality of some movies are so bad they are not watchable in my opinion. Would not recommend to others unless you cannot find copies of movies else where.,1389312000,10,342,4.119402985074627
5934062,3,B00EQ2KXA0,"To me classic horror movies were, The Mummy, Frankenstein, Vampires with Christopher Lee.
I would say I have never heard about 65 % of the movies on here. My mother went on half so she may enjoy more of them.",1389052800,3,208,4.225
5934063,5,B00EQ2KXA0,"No, most of these aren't pristine prints, and yes, you can get many in better looking single-feature special editions. But unless you are a classic horror movie junkie like me, then you aren't going to want to spend a couple K's buying them all. And a little fuzz over some of these ""classics"" is a good thing anyway. Here you get an instant collection of a very good overview of the entire horror genre from the silent age to the cheesy 80's. Classic Monsters, Euro Gothic Horrors, 70's Satanic Sleeze-fests, Slashers, Zombies, Italian Zombies... Many you've seen or heard of (Night Of The Living Dead, Carnival Of Souls, House On Haunted Hill) many you haven't heard of but should see (Nightmare Castle, Blancheville Monster, Satan's Slave) and a few you may wish you never watched. At the sugg retail price, that's 50 cents a pop. If you've yet to get acquainted with the legends that pop up in this set, it's time you did. Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Peter Cushing Christopher Lee, Vincent Price, John Carradine, Barbara Steele, Paul Naschy and so many other high priests and priestesses of terror. If you even have a passing interest in old B-Horror - pick it up!!",1388966400,74,1169,4.735294117647059
5934064,5,B00EQ2KXA0,"What can I say about this ?

It is SOOOOO COOOL !

I have always loved the classic horror movies !

Something about old horror movies just made them better , they had less to work with in those days but they were always great fun !

It's called PUBLIC DOMAIN, people. If Mill Creek bothered to re-master these movies, they could at least claim rights to the re-mastered editions.
You can pretty much have gotten all these titles over the years from Sinister Cinema and probably have the old VHS releases from Goodtimes Home Video. This is a complete waste. Nothing new here. Just another DVD releasing company helping to make the public CHEAP by putting a low price tag on a 50 disc set.

I've only watched the first few of these fifty discs and have been happily surprised again and again. Of course, there are dead-out klunkers, but even they provide enjoyment in their own ways--striking music, some standout acting, some unbelievable writing, some indelible images, etc.  I'm already satisfied that my money was well spent.  The discs are of good quality and are nicely packaged, as long as you don't mind having to keep a slip of paper among the discs as a placeholder as you go along through them.  Some are one-sided and some two-sided.  The box includes a booklet with brief synopses.",1479772800,7,776,4.848484848484849

5934073,5,B00EQ2KXA0,"This is the ultimate grab bag of old ""B"" movies.  Fair warning:  many of the DVD's seem to be salvaged from what appear to be other collections and are not horror movies but rather suspense, mystery and crime films (the Bulldog Drummond films, the Dr. Wong movies, the Sherlock Holmes films, etc.) and--this is also important--some of the prints are absolutely terrible, bordering on unwatchable.  That being said, the majority are good enough to chuckle through and you get a generous helping of all-time classics (Nosferatu and silent versions of Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame, many of the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films, the original Romero Night of the Living Dead, Little Shop of Horrors, and a silent Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde come to mind) as well as tons of lesser-known ""B"" films made by the heavyweights of classic horror (Lon Chaney, John Barrymore, Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, etc.).  I was tempted to give the collection four stars on the merit of the fact that so many of the movies do not fall into the horror genre and quite a few are abysmally bad transfers.  However, when I consider the price, which comes out to roughly fifty cents per movie, I cannot in good conscience give this collection less than five stars.  This will be a delight for die-hard enthusiasts of classic and B horror and thriller movies.",1476576000,13,1350,4.772532188841201
5934074,4,B00EQ2KXA0,"For the price, this product is wonderful. I've watched several of the films already, and I have to say, the other reviews of this product are spot on, in my opinion. A few things to note: If you're a film critic-type (one who relies on having a high quality transfer), this set isn't for you. Some of the films have poor transfers, while others are just fine. However, none of the transfers (that I've come across) are so poor that they inhibit your viewing. Second, while the outer packaging is nice enough looking, don't expect an elaborate set of disks or other ""goodies"" that some box sets come with. Remember, this is a budget friendly set. Included are the disks inside paper sleeves and a small booklet, which gives quick descriptions of each film, along with its disk number and side.

You pays your money (& really not very much for two hundred films) & you takes your choice. I love this set. Some are dire 1930s, some are classic 1950s (there is a fantastic Japanese one from round then) & it goes to the 60s, 70s & 80s. I adore some of the 1960s UK offerings.

5934083,4,B00EQ2KXA0,"Tales Of Terror is a worth collection of horror to add to your horror collection and expand it with 200 movies. One thing you need to know first is that it contains many bad horror films which some are just downright terrible but I don't mean those, I'm referring to horror films that are so bad they're good which Tales Of Terror never stops at. Now there's some good classics here that have fallen into the public domain which everyone has seen (House On Haunted Hill, Night Of The Living Dead, Carnival Of Souls) and some of the all time classics of '20s (Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Phantom Of The Opera) which are nice to have on DVD despite it's format not being the best as well as the packaging. If you want some entertainment at a cheap price, Tales Of Terror is the way to go. Back to the bad horror movies; As I was saying Tales Of Terror contains many films that fall into the ""so bad, they're good"" category. If you enjoy really bad, campy horror films like myself then Tales Of Terror Is more than worth while and introduces you into some films you may never heard of which aren't Citizen Kane or The Godfather but worth entertainment. If you don't like cheesy horror films whatsoever, then Tales Of Terror might not be your best decision. I myself enjoy a variety of horror which I'll be coming back to Tales Of Terror this fall/late summer and up to Halloween for my traditional horror-fest along with some real horror masterpieces (Psycho, The Exorcist, The Shining, Dracula, Nosferatu). Which again aren't on the same level as those I mentioned but are still a lot of fun to watch. We get to see many great actors here Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Barbara Steele, Peter Falk, Vincent Price and a couple later day roles from Joseph Cotten who you might recognize from the classics of the '40s and '50s such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt. We see some small-time actors I recognized such as Barry Morse in Funeral Home (1980) who played Lieutenant Gerard in the classic 1960s show just to name one among many others that never made a big role. There are a couple films that I downright despise that unfortunately came across including the unwatchable Nightmare Never Ends, it was a bad movie but most of all it skips and the production/color looked like it came from a '40s technicolor reel that had been left in the studio for decades. Another one I tried to watch was Slashed Dreams which all I can remember is the horrible music, some 1970s folk singer which thanks to them they've killed the genre for good. Anatomy Of A Psycho, The Sadist, Bloody Brood, Bucket Of Blood, Horror Express, Nightmare Castle, Shriek In The Night and Funeral Home are some unknown ones that are some of the better ones as well that I'd highlight recommend, Tales Of Terror isn't perfect by any means but will offer hours of entertainment which has the classic monsters, psychological thrillers, campy horror, supernatural, mystery, slashers, zombies, comedy-horror, sci-fi/horror and a bit of everything else in the horror genre despite some being better than others. As for the best bad horror films I've seen would have to be a tie between Silent Night, Bloody Night which the escape scene from the mental institution is a classic on it's own and a highlight in bad horror and another one that I enjoy watching is Nightmare In Wax which is basically an ultra-campy, drugged out version of the Vincent Price classic House Of Wax which was already a remake. Memorable scenes were the villains back story where he gets alcohol thrown in his face while smoking rather than having his entire museum burnt down; a couple other good ones are the live band playing known as the T-Bones which I'm not sure if they're real or fictional but who really cares and my personal favorite Berry Kroger trying to be hip as Max Black (""nice seein' ya, Vince baby""). We get a scene at the end with him above the vat of wax on a rope which was done so poorly, you can obviously tell he's standing on the floor in the scene, another classic scene in bad horror. Again, if you don't like watching bad horror movie or bad films in general than Tales Of Terror might not be worth it but i you do then don't hesitate. Tales Of Terror has it's pros and cons but despite the quality of the films, offers hours of entertainment with a bit of everything for everyone to enjoy.",1437868800,4,4370,4.5681528662420385

I've been eyeballing this set for over a year now finally bit the bullet and decided to buy it.  I look forward to working my way through the collection.

I've never been able to find a watchable copy of horror express until now. That doesn't mean the quality is excellent, but good enough that you are able to enjoy watching it. So many classics. So many that are hard to get. If you are indeed a classic horror fan, GET THIS!!!",1424390400,3,411,4.15

5934091,4,B00EQ2KXA0,"I want to first thank the reviewer Michelle 34 for making up the list of movies in this set because it helped a great deal in decided if this set is worth the money. I do have four sets already; ""Pure terror"", ""Horror Classics"", ""Chilling Classics"", Sci Fi Invasion"", and 'Sci Fi Classics"". A great deal of these same films are found in these collections, especially the three horror collections. There is another collection I do not have called ""Legends of Horror"" which also contain even more as well as a ""100 Mystery"" collection. So, it's a basic decision and trade-off. I found the five that I own now for $5.00 each in a Wal mart Bin so I paid $25 for them. I wish I had seen the Legends of horror set but did not. Yes there are movies I do not have but also movies I DO have in the collections not included in this set. I have this thing about 'completion' also. So, there are actually 57 films in this set I do not have. Fifteen are in Legends of Horror. Another 22 are found in another set called '100 mysteries' collection which I also do not have. So, you can count them up yourself if you want to. But is it worth the extra money for more films not in my sets AND films I have but not in THIS set? Hard to say. Also remember that these films are very poor quality films because they are also public domain films. But it's often a nice treat. You can decide for yourself if you already have any of these movies or not. I have not made up my mind yet. If do not have any of the above mentioned sets and you like these kind of movies, I'd say go for it rather than getting lots of other sets. But if you already have some or all of the sets I have, then maybe pass on it unless you can find an even better price somewhere else.",1420243200,5,1736,4.093841642228739
5934092,5,B00EQ2KXA0,"TALES OF TERROR- 200 CLASSIC HORROR MOVIES is a mixed bucket of guts. As is normal for these multi-title ""Mega-Packs"" of ""public domain"" movies, it contains many old, unpolished, non-restored, black and white films from the 1920s through the 50s. Several silent classics, like METROPOLIS, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and NOSFERATU are definite keepers. Others (in full sound), such as THE APE (Boris Karloff), BLUEBEARD (John Carradine), THE BAT (Vincent Price, Agnes Moorehead), CARNIVAL OF SOULS (Candace Hilligoss), THE AMAZING MR. X (Turhan Bey), WHITE ZOMBIE (Bela Lugosi), THE VAMPIRE BAT (Lionel Atwell, Faye Ray, Dwight Fry), etc., are semi-classics in their own right! Of course, there are also the ultra-cheeeze  / schlock ""classics"" like BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE, THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN, and MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, guaranteed to cause brain trauma, so view w/ caution! For whatever reason, these collections always seem to include oddball titles that don't fit the genre. This one is no exception, containing several Sherlock Holmes and Bulldog Drummond mysteries, as well as some noir staples like DETOUR and KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL. Plus, there are a few giant monsters roaming around in MONSTERS FROM THE PREHISTORIC PLANET and THE GIANT GILA MONSTER. Even some ""newer""  (1960s-70s) color films are included, like (the very adult!) WEREWOLF WOMAN, (the equally adult and disturbing!) NAKED MASSACRE, DEVIL TIMES FIVE, THE UNDERTAKER AND HIS PALS, WEREWOLF OF WASHINGTON, and the Paul Naschy films- DEVIL'S POSSESSED, DR. JECKYL AND THE WEREWOLF, FURY OF THE WOLFMAN, and HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB. In addition, there are scads of Barbara Steele movies- NIGHTMARE CASTLE, THE GHOST, etc., some excellent Todd Slaughter films, Ken Utsui's STARMAN movies, and other odds and ends. This 200 film collection is absolutely worth owning!... WARNING: As always, the movie line-ups of future editions of this ""public domain"" title are subject to change without notice! It's a good idea to check the distributer's website for updates to avoid confusion...",1415059200,27,2115,5.348348348348348
5934093,5,B00EQ2KXA0,I love horror movies and it is great to be able to buy them.  I received a mailing about the collection which was over $10.00 more in cost plus shipping of course.  With my total order it was free and I October is the month for scary movie marathons.  I do watch them all year long.  If you love horror movies as much as I do and love finding those older movies that are not available other places buy this collection.  I have a several collections and one is worth it.,1414800000,5,469,4.1098901098901095

5934095,4,B00EQ2KXA0,Can't believe some people expect 200 movies to be in prime condition for this price.  Just for the record:  yes some of the transfers  ARE NOT GOOD; some are mediocre at best; yes these are B AND Z films so don't really expect 'classics' as the title of this says. Most of these are old films and are just for fun.  Save your money if you're wanting new films with great transfers as that's not what you're going to get.  This is a fun collection though and I don't regret the purchase. Some of the films aren't very good but they remind me of the type of films I watched that were on Shock Theatre when I was a child.

8608393,3,B00EQ2KXA0,"I have quite a few films from Mill Creek Entertainment. I purchased this set under a different title - good marketing to sell the same product several times. Mill Creek's video transfers are quite poor. I estimate that 20% of the picture image is missing due to the video copying device too close to the film display. Also, picture contrast and clarity as well as sound are not at all a priority to Mill Creek. That being said, I have found some films that are quite good, and I then purchase a quality dvd of that film. Price is not bad, and these can usually be found cheaper elsewhere.",1495411200,,588,4.4036697247706424
8608394,3,B00EQ2KXA0,"This review is for the quality of picture and sound, packaging and the DVD's themselves, not the movies in the set.

Cons: Most DVD's are double sided, only about 20 discs are actually one sided. The picture quality of many films are very low (slightly out of focus, many scratches, etc.) and SOME Widescreen films (both Frankenstein films, for example) have been cut down to Full Frame and have been ruined because of the reformatting. If your home movie collection consists of more blu-rays than DVD's, then you will hate this set and would only give it 1 star.

Pros: Each disc comes in it's own sleeve and all 50 discs are then bundled together to prevent damage during shipping. You will get your moneys worth out of this set if you're the type who still watches VHS tapes (3.5 stars) or you want to own obscure films for as little money as possible and you don't care about picture quality (5 stars, this set is for you). The box/packing is very nice looking and sturdy. The booklet list each disc and what films are on them.

The films in this set are very random. For example, the film ""Too Late For Tears"" is actually film noir and not horror. The picture and sound quality of ""Too Late..."" has many rough cuts, pop sounds and numerous scratches, but the film itself is still a joy to watch if you can look past the problems.

Considering all of the above, the price range for this box set should be between $40 and $50, including shipping. If you can buy this set for less than $50, you will be pleased with your purchase.",1491868800,2,1532,4.4412811387900355

Quality of movies what I expected for the price, and I love the crackling and slight damaged parts of these iconic old films.
