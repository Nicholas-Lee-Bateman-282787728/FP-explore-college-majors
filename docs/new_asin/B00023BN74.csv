2057417,5,B00023BN74,"Brandon and Harry are best friends since the times they were in the orphanage. But after seeing the tragic dead of their friends they decide to change their way of living. Harry wants to rise to the top, and from above watch everything he has accomplished. Brandon wants to be close to Maria, his girlfriend, who after her dad's dead was taken in by her father's old friend, Big Daddy, the boss of Millenium. Millenium is the mafia that controls the city. In order for Harry to rise to the top he needs to enter that Mafia and form part of the ring of friends of Big Daddy (""the family""). Harry wants Brandon to come with him, after all they are duo. Brandon accepts, but only because in that way, he'll be able to see Maria.
Both are facing to the sky, running towards the top, chasing their dreams. But in Millenium there is only one rule, it's called the Iron Law, ""To protect is to never betray"", whoever fails to follow that rule, will be considered a traitor and consequently eliminated.
Gungrave is definitely the best tittle of its genre, forget about Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Noir (this latter one is my favorite anime by the way), none of the them can rival the excellent storyline, the amazing characterization and the blending of both. Don't be fooled by the guy on the cover of the first dvd, ""Beyond the Grave"", he only appears in the first episode, and doesn't come back till the second half of the series. And don't worry about the first episode sucking really bad. Because the people who have already watched this anime will agree with me, that this first episode is one of the worst in anime history, but also, don't worry, that episode is only a brief and bad introduction to what will happen later in the series, the same episode is remade in the second half of the series, and that time is done well. From episode two and on is when the story begins. Two young punks experiencing the hardships of living in a tough city with no one to support them, they can only steal and sell what they rob in order to live. But that's to change when they decide to enter the local Mafia, Millenium.
The story is like no other, and the character development is superbly done. This you won't regret buying. A real action-drama with a small sci-fi twist, great animation, and an excellent soundtrack.
From the creator of Trigun, an anime with the feeling of Berserk, the style of Noir, and the looks of Cowboy Bebop. I highly reccomend it.",1090195200,2,2444,4.49438202247191

Also in terms of the Amazon.com editor saying that the character of Beyond The Grave, or Brandon if you will, being too stoic, and uninteresting. Those who played game already knew that this particualar character is definantly no Vash the Stampede. He is a killing machine pure and simple, and while This DVD may have arrived to late to boost the last game I hope it will provide a nice lift for Gungrave OD.",1089849600,2,528,4.343434343434343
2057419,3,B00023BN74,"Maybe it's just me, but when I see an ad for an Anime DVD with a big gun-toting badass on the cover, I expect to see him in more than one out of four episodes on the DVD.
Gungrave Vol. 1 'Beyond the Grave' would have been more aptly titled 'BEFORE the Grave' since it only involves one episode of 'Gungrave action' and three episodes of young Brandon Heat fist fighting in the streets of...wherever.
Don't get me wrong, the Anime looked good.  The dialog was decent, with the exception of the main character who didn't have any.  It was a quality DVD, just not what I was hoping for after reading the back of the box.
Perhaps Vol. 2, due at the end of Sept., will get back to the Brandon After Death (or B.A.D.) character that all of the ads are talking about...but I doubt it.  At the end of the fourth episode, prospects of getting out of the character history flashback did not look good.",1089417600,2,891,4.291666666666667
2057420,5,B00023BN74,"Gungrave was created by Yasuhiro Nighttow(Trigun) & the animation is done by MADHOUSE(Animatrix, Trigun, Texhnolyze). This is a awesome story that follows Brandon Heat & Harry MacDowel, two friends trying to make it in a neighborhood where death is a everyday occurence.  Gungrave tells the story of how two childhood friends make their way up through the ranks of the mafia group known as the Millennium Organization.  But somewhere something went wrong Harry became the head of Millennium but Brandon became a being known as Beyond the Grave who only seeks to destroy Millennium.
This is a very good first volume.  It has a compelling story, interesting characters, great animation, & a really good dub. And the music fits the mood of the series well.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes mafia tales,gun action, great story, & just anyone that likes anime.  It definitely deserves to be checked out.",1089158400,3,910,5.0
2057421,5,B00023BN74,"One looks to anime to feast on the imagination of others.  This is title is definately a ""work of art"".  On the strength of Hellsing, a predecessor to Gungrave, I hoped to find something long and strong on imagination.
Gungrave more than satisfied the desire to see something at the ""next level"". It is an anime rich in story, where you love and hate the characters and remember their names. It offers the science fiction and action expected in anime, but with a humanity emphasis usually found in Miramax prestige films.
In countless ways, Hellsing style anime is ingeniously implemented by the authors to provide powerful contrasts with reality.  This anime sees something in the genius of humanity and captures it animation.  Gungrave captures the best of reality and fiction, mixes them together, and delivers a compelling story.
Gungrave is so good about 1/3 through the 26 episodes, I thought even if the rest was the most nauseating stuff ever conceived by man, this would still be a remarkable effort.  Instead, Gungrave only got better and better.  Most of all, Gungrave leaves a memorable ending, leaving a powerful message burned in your soul.  Chances are you will agree and will join the ""Family"" of admirers.",1088467200,7,1222,4.931707317073171
2057422,5,B00023BN74,"Buy this.  This anime sucks you in and will leave you glued to the screen from start to finish.  Its a sad tale about friendship, betrayal, and revenge.  for those familiar with Cowboy Bebop I'd say it reminds me of what Spike and Vicious's backstory would have been like.  Its very dark, very thought provoking and moving.  Its a mafia/sci-fi story about two childhood friends who join the mob, one to protect the one he cares for, and the other so that he can be free and raise himself up out of the gutter.  Decisions each of them make lead to good times but also to actions they regret.  A definate must see!",1087171200,6,612,4.3628318584070795

2057464,4,B00023BN74,"I wasn't sure what to expect with Gungrave. Anime made from video games is notorious for having less than engaging plot lines. Yet I was pleasantly surprised by Gungrave, a video game adaption that works as an anime very well.

The action starts in the middle, with a massive gunman in a cowboy hat and gothic wardrobe coming to life and wiping out creatures attacking him and a young woman and scientist living in a van. The scientist tells the young woman, Mika, to refer to the man as Beyond the Grave since he is no longer the person he was in life, Brandon Heat, a man in love with Mika's mother long ago. Grave can clean up and apparently doesn't talk, though Brandon rarely talked either, so that's probably not all that odd. All this happens in the first episode, leaving the next three to be flashbacks of Brandon's younger days when he was best friends with Harry Macdowell, now the crime lord of the city, and when he was in love with Maria, who has been murdered apparently after Brandon himself was. It seems that Brandon was a Sweeper for the mob in his younger years, a person responsible for cleaning up the mafia's messes when needed. He is also referred to as being the best Sweeper there ever was, something the fashbacks haven't gotten to thus far.

Brandon and Grave, since they're one in the same, are good guys. They might fight to survive and be good at that, but they're kind people and very loyal and don't seem to be wild about the violence, at least Brandon doesn't since Grave seems to not have a care in the world about killing the bad guys. Brandon is the driving force of the series, it's his story, which is a little odd since he says all of six sentences in the entire four episodes. He's a man of very few words apparently. While the series is made to deal with Grave trying to save Mika, there is really little known about that plot line and more emphasis on Brandon as a young man leading to his betrayal by his best friend.

The series is great to look at, as should be expected from the creators of Trigun. Grave is an entirely new look for a main character, with the goth cowboy gear. The main problem is that Brandon *doesn't* talk, even when it seems he should. Other characters ask him questions and all he'll do is nod or look at them. Grave himself doesn't talk at all. We hear some internal monologue from the characters, but Brandon/Grave just doesn't talk except for a few isolated incedents, which makes you wonder how he every won over Maria, even though he obviously loves her and he's obviously handsome. There was also a very small amount of Grave, considering the series is called Gungrave. Hopefully the back story will be over soon and Grave will become the main character again.

Gungrave is a good series is spite of all that. It's interesting and Grave is a wonderfully unique character. It's possibly the best series based on a video game.",1098403200,6,2899,4.484848484848484
2057465,4,B00023BN74,"I didn't know what to think when I saw this on the shelves of my dvd store.  I loved Trigun with every fiber of my being and I knew from my experience with videogames that Gungrave was made by Yasuhiro Nightow, the creater of the revered Trigun.  Well I bought the box set, just because that's the only way I could find it.  Anyway I heard that the game was known for lots of style, lots of action, and lots of shallowness.

I was pleasently surprised.  I'm not one to like tooooo much action, and story is almost everything to me as long as it's not boring.  The first episode started with a near perfect mix of story and action!  From introducing Grave to showing his companions and the city they were in, I was drawn in.  I was a little aggitated by his lack of speech, but then I remembered not only is he dead, but in some rpg's I've played, the main character didn't speak and it didn't bother me.

Well that episode was beautiful and interesting to me at least...  The next episodes took me by surprise.  It was all about Bradon (Grave) and his friends as they struggle to survive in a town where death is common and breaking the law is no longer considered ""bad"".  This story makes you emotionally involved in the still quiet Brandon and his gang friends.

Unfortunately, this is where it ends.  I would have liked more Beyond the Grave action and story parts, but hopefully the next one has.  I'm very excited for the next one!

The bottom line is, if you like a gritty dark story of betrayal and redemption (sounds familiar, doesn't it?) you will enjoy this.  No more goofiness like Trigun, but it's still good in it's own right.  Check it out on your own!",1095811200,4,1666,4.353896103896104
2057466,4,B00023BN74,"first off i hate this whole empty box with 1 dvd idea and the pricing is stupid....

this is one series that might actually sound better in english...

the story sems to take place in the future and everything is pretty much westernized, but all their mannerisms r extremely japanese... the first episode is completely boring and does not spark any interest for me to continue watchin... but i did... thru the flashbacks, the story gets to take on a lot of depth, it follows the lives of these characters thru decades... and it was very surprisingly good, the character and plot development... but since this series is based off a videogame, a lot of its depth and thoughtfulness is undercut by fights that seems completely ridiculous and videogame like... overall it's nicely done series...

but i hate the outrageous prices of the american licensed anime dvds",1092182400,3,861,4.843537414965986
2057467,5,B00023BN74,"YO!, I bought this movie with the thoughts of how much action it would be. I read the back of the case and thought ""okay,this seems intersting"". I did not expect a anime to have so much plot and character development. This story is really really good and that is just the first Vol. I would have love to see more of the present day Brandon, but I have to admit the mob influenced past is really addictive and it does leave you wanting more. This is a really great beginning to what appears to be.. ONE HELL OF A GOOD ANIME.",1091491200,4,523,4.137254901960785
2057468,1,B00023BN74,"I was psyched for Gungrave, largely because I really enjoyed the anime segments of the videogame. The character design and atmosphere was phenomenal, and despite there being less than twenty minutes of total anime sequences in the game, it was obvious that this could have been translated into a stunning miniseries.

 Imagine my surprise when this first disc fell flat on its face.

 Where to begin? The writing is completely overwrought, and so melodramatic it removes any potential that one might actually relate to the characters. Brandon Heat is nearly mute, to the point where it becomes quite irritating. The visual style is different than the game, which though obviously for technical reasons, is inferior in every way.

 The first episode is the only episode where the character is ""Beyond the Grave"" - the unstoppable main character of the videogame. In the remaining three episodes, it tells his origin, as an aimless street punk named Brandon. The problem with this is that Brandon is a nearly mute yutz. He can apparently fight well enough, but beyond that there's no reason to care about him, or his other stereotypical friends.

 The main problem with the anime is that the game was fundamentally about style. Whether it was the main character striking a pose, or wading through your enemies with unlimited ammo, Gungrave made its mark because it had a unique style. The anime is completely devoid of anything even remotely approaching the quality of the anime contained in the game. If you want a Gungrave anime series, I'd suggest you play the game, then imagine what *you* would do with an anime series based on the same subject matter. I have no doubt that whatever you're thinking, it's better than what's on this disc.",1091059200,5,1740,4.914675767918089
2057469,5,B00023BN74,"Those thinking this is another version of Trigun will be disappointed.  Gungrave is actually a lot deeper and more complex.  The lead is short on dialouge, but the story has more depth and character development than most anime. The first DVD is more about the main character's past than about the reanimated killing machine he's become, but it definitely leaves you wanting more.",1090886400,,379,5.0
2057470,5,B00023BN74,"Gungrave is, without a doubt, one of the best animes I have ever seen.  It rivals Cowboy Bebop in complexity and gunplay, if you're into that sort of thing.

Gungrave centers around Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowel, best friends who live aimlessly on the street, doing whatever they can just to get by.  But after they pick a fight with the brother of a newly made Mafioso, they find themselves fleeing for their lives.  This leads them on a path to joining the syndicate known as Millenion, and here is where the story really begins.

The first episode might put you off, but after you watch the second episode you'll know that this series is something special.  The first episode is, rather, a look forward in the series.

There is a Gungrave video game, but this anime is not based on that.  Rather, it is its own, rich story which has many differences from the game, and has its own flavor.

The Trigun animation style is clearly evident, but the story far eclipses that of Trigun in story depth, and the music is also well done.

All anime fans, new and old alike, should see this series.  Gungrave is one of those shows that only comes once in a while, and truly brings something special to the table.",1090886400,10,1206,4.486238532110092
2057471,4,B00023BN74,"""Gungrave"" is an excellent new anime based on a manga by Yasuhiro Nightow, the creator of ""Trigun,"" which was then turned into a videogame. The videogame is fine, but the anime is awesome!

 The plot of Gungrave follows one Brandon Heat, a street tough resurrected to destroy his former best friend Harry, now the crime boss of the city in which these events take place, and his efforts to protect the daughter of the woman he loved, Maria, from the sinister white 'orgmen' pursuing her at Harry's behest (said orgmen bear a pronounced resemblance to the enemies of Kingdom Hearts 2, but that's another story).

 I had no idea what to expect when I first viewed Gungrave, but I was blown away by its pulse-throbbing gun battles, exaagerated, well-drawn characters, and inscrutable (at least for the first disc) plotline. Though word on the street is that Gungrave is a lot like Trigun, I would say that while the two series do share some secondary elements, mostly in atmosphere, the two animes couldn't be more different simply because their protagonists are total opposites. Vash comes off as something of a ditz, though he's amazing with a gun, while Brandon Heat, in the present, is so taciturn I've known rocks with better conversational skills, and in the past is not exactly loquacious either. Moreover, he has no scruples when it comes to combat.

 Simply put, Gungrave hooked me from the very first minute, and it hasn't let go yet. The three-episode flashback creates more questions than it answers, and the machinations of the surviving characters in the present are not readily understandable either. Moreover, their reactions are just comical, especially those between Brandon and Maria's daughter, whose attempts to learn to fire a gun in the first episode are hilarious.",1090540800,4,1785,4.973154362416107
2057472,5,B00023BN74,"I have been waiting a very long time to get my hands on this series and it was worth every minute of the wait time!
A tale of loyalty, trust, and the ultimate betrayal, Gungrave is a seriously driven character story with enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat.
In the opening episode, Beyond the Grave awakens to seriously kick the ass of a multitude of undead creatures.  From his stylish attire to his awesome display of firepower, Grave is the type of guy who shoots first and makes damn sure no one is left to answer any questions.  Grave makes Vash the Stampede look like a rank amateur when it comes down to serious gunplay.
Later in the volume, we meet Brandon and Harry, a couple of young street punks trying to make it along with their small gang on the tough streets of their town.  Through a series of fights and shoot-outs with the local crime boss and rival gangs, we see Harry and Brandon as they step into the world of organized crime.
I would almost say that this tale would be akin to a cross between Hellsing and Trigun, only much better.
Grab your guns and extra ammo, kiddies.  It looks like Gungrave will be a hell of a ride.
P.S.  As a parent, I would NOT recommend this for younger children.  The anime is rated for 16 and up.  There are sexual innuendoes, brief nudity, and graphic violence.  Purchase this based on your child's maturity level. (I let my 12 and 13 year old watch this and they are still raving about how good the story is!)",1090195200,8,1476,4.322463768115942

From the teasing introduction to the last episode, it was quite an experience. Every episode has an appropriate ending, and actually carries the plot (Unlike some animes that end with the status quo). But If you want the whole experience done right then i suggest you do what I did. Go back to the very origin of Gungrave and pick up a copy of Gungrave for PS2. That's right!!! It all started as a video game. So just play through that (its not hard at all). Then you'll be ready to start on the Anime, which unfolds quite possibly one of the greatest fictional stories of betrayal and ultimate vengeance ever.",1142899200,,758,4.421428571428572
8021130,4,B00023BN74,"The first of the ""Gungrave"" series starts out in the not-too distant future, a world that appears to be right on the cusp of a dawning new age where science has brought forth monsters and virtually unstoppable cyborgs.  A lone scientist, a teenage girl, and an early cyborg prototype - who's first activation is in the opening moments of the disc's first episode - are on the run from a vastly powerful and utterly ruthless organization which seems to be at the heart of the upcoming chaos.  It succeeds in having its characters make an instant impression that you'll want to care about them, and offers the kind of stunning, monsterous action (with stunning sound) that will appeal to all horror and action fans.

  Then everything changes.  With the story barely begun and everything still very enigmatic we're suddenly back over a decade in the past starting with the 2nd episode, in a time that's apparantly the present, to witness how it all begins.  Having not Yet seen the rest of the series (they're definately on my must-see list) I can only assume that the series is going to follow the characters through the years, eventually 'catch up' with that first episode, and then move on from there.

  The story the subsequent episodes on ""Gungrave Volume 1"" tells is of a modern-day city where smalltime teenage criminal gangs operate under a loose series of what I guess you'd call supervisors, who in turn answer to the mafia (a mafia that has its hand deep into all the cutting-edge sciences).  The thing is, if I'd known that this was the focus of ""Beyond The Grave"" I probably never would have rented it, but I found myself drawn into it very deeply.  It's well done and while most of the teenage criminal element seem to be just scum, plain and simple, there are characters among them who are surprisingly likable, possessed of the kind of nature that one would not expect to find them living their lives as small-time mob minions.  I'm actually hoping the series goes back a little as well as forward and shows how some of these characters wound up where they are at episode 2's beginning.  Instantly likable is the young (and non gang member) girl, Maria I believe her name was who shares a mutual attraction with one of the smalltimers that her father is trying very hard to discourage.

Not what I expected to get but none the worse for it; this is just the kind of movie that shows that one should vary from their more frequent paths every now and then because you never know when you'll be really blown away by a kind of movie you haven't had much prior experience with.  Really looking forward to seeing the rest of this series, and really recommending this volume to those who haven't seen it yet.",1123632000,2,2716,4.615384615384615
8021131,4,B00023BN74,"This anime starts out with a very weak first episode, as most animes seem to do (Berserk, Eva, etc.).  However, it quickly turns into a very good mafia saga detailing the epic rise of two childhood thugs Brandon Heat and Harry McDowell.  This goes well for the first...15 episodes or so.  In fact, there are some parts that are just downright poetic.  Watching it for the first time, I really loved watching the characters go about doing their mafioso business.  There is also a rich assortment of secondary characters such as Bunji, Bear Walken, Balladbird Lee, Big Daddy, I could go on.  In good anime, I tend to really begin to care about what happens to the characters, such as in Berserk and the Crest/Banner of the Stars series. This happened here, despite Brandon's strange ""stoicness"" through the first eight episodes or so.

However...what had begun as an incredible series quickly collapses on its face in a matter of a couple episodes.  After an incredible episode that really stops your heart with its emotional punch and unpredictable twist (you'll find yourself screaming through the TV screen at the people on screen), the story changes for the worst.  To put it bluntly, it turns from an epic mafia saga of two friends fighting to rise to the top of a major crime family to a supernatural action fest that leaves everything to be desired.  Granted, it did have a good ending, but the second half of the series is so inappropriate I feel like it is my duty to warn everyone before hand.  Enjoy the first half, then be prepared for the second half.  I rate it four because the first half really is that good.  Oh well, not every anime can be perfect.",1118793600,4,1664,4.638225255972697

The first episode definitely lived up to this reputation. The other three episodes, though, go into the main character's past. Plenty of time given to the storyline. This is definitely not a volume you want to miss if you want to understand the plot since it shows the very beginning of how Brandon got into his predicament.

The reason I didn't give the show five stars is because I'm not a big fan of lengthy flashbacks. I like little bits at a time, not the whole past being laid out all at once. Even at the end of volume 1, the flashback appears it will continue on several more episodes into volume 2. It is still a very interesting show, but there is a major drop in intense action because of this flashback.

Still, I'm pretty sure most people will enjoy this DVD with its great animation and sound effects. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next in this show.",1111795200,,1000,4.429347826086956

 Brandon Heat is the strong silent type he doesn't say much but he doesn't have to say anything to get his point across.
