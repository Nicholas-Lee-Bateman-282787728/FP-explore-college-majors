2254457,5,B0007Z9QXK,"This DVD was fun to watch and the quality of the DVD was good (the picture was better than some of the DVDs that I have of old 1950s shows).

  This DVD also brought back some memories of my youth.  Even though the program originally came on the air back in a time when my parents were a little young to have children, I remember (as a young kid) watching old reruns of the show on a local television station (KTVU Channel 2 based out of Oakland, California) back in the 1970s.  It came on about 4:30 in the afternoon and I would watch it every day.  I enjoyed watching the show back then because it was a show which I found entertaining and educational (a quality that kids' shows of today lack).

  In conclusion, I hope that Disney puts each season of the show on DVD (one set for each season).",1121385600,8,797,4.190789473684211
2254458,1,B0007Z9QXK,"I was 5 years old when the Original Mickey Mouse Club came on TV.  This DVD is the sorriest excuse Best of anything I have ever seen.  It takes 5 shows one each Monday through Friday, but their content is anything but the best.",1121212800,16,227,4.136363636363637
2254459,1,B0007Z9QXK,"I want to be very kind in writing this because Jimmie was kind. I don't believe that he would feel like his former employer did their very best when putting out this DVD. Let me explain why. For one thing, I was expecting the very same visual quality that we have on ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Mickey Mouse Club"". It's not there. If you have that DVD set you probably know how crisp everything looks. Obviously, a great deal of clean up went on with those shows. In this DVD, all five shows, at least in my opinipn look dingy and dirty. Not at all clear. The sound quality is not nearly as good as The Walt Disney Treasures. Now, pertaining to the shows that they used, if you own the ten volume VHS set that Disney put out several years ago, you already own all five of these episodes. You would think that someone would use some creativity and go way back in the vaults and use some rarities that were not within the ten volume set.  It appears to me that they just grabbed what was convenient and slapped it together. I honestly don't feel like anyone who knows and loves ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" put this together. I feel as though someone who knows and loves money put it together. Disney, you proved within ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Mickey Mouse Club"" that you can do some excellent work pertaining to putting this show on DVD. Disney, were you really trying to do your best, as you did with that set, when you put this DVD together or did you just want to make a quick buck? Disney, would Walt be proud of this? He always wanted to provide the very best for people. Disney, would Jimmie be proud of this? He was always urging us to do our very best. I really wanted to be kind when I started this review. However, sometimes, telling the truth is the kindest thing to do because maybe it will persuade Disney to do their very best the next time. I hope that there is a next time with everything that I mentioned incorporated within it. It appears as if this thing was just slapped together and what a shame because that's not the legacy of Walt Disney nor would Jimmie Dodd approve because it shows that Disney was not doing its best.",1121126400,77,2148,4.316831683168317
2254460,4,B0007Z9QXK,"Okay, here it is in a ""nutshell.""  Yes the memories are there, especially for us that grew up in the 50's.  No adjustment of your rooftop antenna is needed. I think the digital transfer was slightly better on the ""Golden Treasures"" release, however, considering that most of these shows have not been ""aired"" in a long time,...not bad.  The original series, lasted from 1955-1958..so I don't know what the dates on the back of the case mean, unless they're copyright renewals, then somebody at Disney needs to ""brush-up"" on history.  The Disney people should've enclosed a booklet inside containing facts, but then again, that is why it is moderately priced.  All episodes contain a cartoon, with one that presents a Hardy Boys ""teaser.""  I can only hope that Disney decides to release the rest of the T.V. series on DVD, and why not,... everybody else is jumping on the ""bandwagon.""  For the price of memories..go for it!!",1120867200,13,923,4.840764331210191

2254462,5,B0007Z9QXK,"I have ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Mickey mouse Club"" and that set gets me thirst y for more. I am greatly anticipating this DVD. Hey Disney, obiously ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Best of the Mickey Mouse Club"" must have sold well otherwise this DVD would not be coming very soon. By the way,Jondog, I totally agree with your statement that Disney Needs to releast at least a few episodes of the '70's show. It's not really fair to the fans of that show to be releasing a lot of material from the '50's show, some from the '80's and '90's show, and leave you folks out. Disney, are you listening? This group of people has disposable income. Jondog, if you're reading this, I remember how frustrating it was when some of I wanted the '50's show to come out on DVD. I was overjoyed when it did. You folks shouldn't be left out in the cold. Please Disney, release some of the shows from the '70's. Now, pertaining to ""The Best of The Mickey Mouse Club"", this was the show that eventualy knocked ""Howdy Doody"" off of daily television and then it was finally put on put back on the air in 1960. Kids knew quality entertainment and the parents and teachers really liked the fact that it also educated children. Lest we forget, the wonderful and gracious Jimmie Dodd. What a wonderful and kind man that he was. He was a genuinely wonderful role model. I'd really like to see Disney release a dvd or a book with nothing but his ""Words to Grow By"" or ""Doddisms"" that he gave the audience at the close of most shows. Hooray for Disney for what they're doing! Now, Disney, please do the very same thing for those who love the '70's show. I was too old for the '70's show when it was originally on, but, I believe that it would only be fair if Disney would put some of those shows on DVD becaue, from what I've seen, those shows had a lot of talented kids and it was good clean entertainment. I've seen a few of them and they really were good. Jondog, I'm with you!",1118188800,8,1958,4.308943089430894

2254464,4,B0007Z9QXK,"I'm sure this ""Best"" DVD will continue to whet the appetites of all fans of the original Mickey Mouse Club. Since this won't be released until July, 2005, I can only give it a rating based on anticipation.  I was exuberantly pleased with the Disney Treasury that contained the first week of the original MM Club and hope the marketing gurus will release the complete series.  I'd also like to see DVDs released of the original ""Spin and Marty"" and ""The Applegate Treasure,"" as well as other serials that appeared on the original MM Club show.  These are classics and should be made available to the public!  And yes, I'd even buy the ""new"" MMC shows too (70s or 80s): as they are nostalgic and classic in their own right.  For Disney buffs, we can't get enough.  So keep 'em coming!

2254465,5,B0007Z9QXK,"Hey, Disney!  This release is great, but how about some episodes or highlights of the terrific batch of Mouseketeers from the late 70's on DVD?  That incredibly colorful, well-produced, dazzlingly choreographed and magnificently scored version of the NMMC has been hiding in the vaults for way too long.  The energetic, super-talented kids (all 12 of them!) rival ANY of their 50's counterparts for talent and personality.  Also, that was the first Mickey Mouse Club to feature Mouseketeers of color, and their cast album was the highest selling children's album of 1977.  Sure a few episodes were shown on Vault Disney in the wee hours of the morning several years ago, but there are many of us who'd love to share that great show with the children in our lives.  I certainly think they'd relate to it a lot more than this 50's one.  People in their late 30's and early 40's have disposable income too!  Bring back the Disco Mice!",1115510400,4,931,4.775

2254647,3,B0007Z9QXK,"I discovered the original Mickey Mouse Club in the early/mid 70's when it ran in syndication. I was in my youth at that time. My sister and I loved the show. She had her favorites that included Annette and Tommy. I liked Darlene and Doreen. But, most of all, Cheryl. The girl with the million dollar smile:) I also loved Cheryl from reruns and the good work she did on other tv shows between 1960-1964 before dropping out of the biz to get married. Anyway, the Mickey Mouse Club still holds up today. Lots of interesting segments, serials, cartoons, and guest performers. Ethnic diversity included. This disc was inexpensive, so I went for it. Got some good guest performances. A cool juggling act with help from a very funny Roy! One segment had a good Dixieland band backed by Mouseketeers. Cartoons are fun. And, the ""documentary"" stories they did were interesting. But, it lacked song and dance numbers by the Mouseketeers. That is what I wanted to see most. My Cheryl is featured as a cute onlooker in a couple of the guest acts. Of course, she is on the roll calls. And, she and some of the other Mouseketeer girls do an absolutely adorable version of the intro song to a Mouse-cartoon. The Mickey Mouse Club has lots of good stuff. This disc is kind of a weak representation of the show. No bonus features is also a minus. I still kind of enjoyed the disc. But, it could have been a lot better and provided more material. Hopefully, there will be future discs that are more carefully put together than this one. At least, I can watch some of the Mouseketeer song and dance numbers on places like YouTube.",1344297600,5,1611,4.5395189003436425
2254648,5,B0007Z9QXK,very touching watching these old episodes after all these years. I grew up on the original mickey mouse club. As soon as I got home after school through the weekdays this came on shortly after...no homework 'till we watched the show for that day.highly recommended,1331942400,,264,4.888888888888889
2254649,4,B0007Z9QXK,"It's no Disney Treasures set, and it's certainly no season set. What we do get here is just a sampler, one episode for each weekday, of the 22 minute episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club. 22 minute episodes means these are episodes from the third season (1957) and from the later, recycled material seasons of the early 60s. It's not ideal, and it is hard to believe that this ""Best of the Mickey Mouse Club"" DVD truly carries some of the best episodes, but it's still nice for nostalgia's sake. We hardcore Disney fans, of course, still want some serious sets. On the bright side, unlike the existing Mickey Mouse Club Disney Treasures set (that holds the first 5 episodes of the show, 1 hour each), this DVD features Cheryl Holdridge episodes. I realize most guys at the time had a crush on Annette, but I was always a Cheryl guy (and no, I didn't grow up in the 50's, I was born in '75 and grew up on reruns... along with really cheesy reimaginings). She's adorable as usual here, though we really don't ever see her being featured beyond roll call.

Anyway, here's what we do get:

Fun With Music Day: A corny as heck musical number featuring Darlene in a pet shop, an intro to the upcoming Hardy Boys serial, ""Mystery of Ghost Farm"", and Doreen and Jimmie singing some Word to Grow By.

Guest Star Day: An Olympic ice skating medalist does a very unpleasant comedy routine in drag and then cleans up for some regular tricks, our Mousekartoon is ""Ferdinand the Bull"", and Jimmie gives us more wise words with a Safety First song.

Anything Can Happen Day: We start this one off with some fun entertainment by Disney animators' Dixieland band ""The Fire House 5 + 2"" along with music and antics from the Mouseketeers, then we get a Mousekartoon: ""Mickey's Nightmare"".

Circus Day: After a fun roll call, we see a juggling performance, then Mousekartoon ""The Pied Piper"".  Jimmie ends things with some words of wisdom.

Round-Up Day: Our last episode features a talent showcase by singer and Honorary Mouseketeer Cheryl Weinberg and her partners. Pretty weak by today's talent standards, but probably pretty impressive back then. We then get a Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel about Hawaiian culture seen on a visit by some Mouseketeer representatives, and finally, Jimmie gives us a Mouseke-fable.

Overall, these aren't very spectacular episodes, but they are pleasant and entertaining for fans of the show, especially when the only other option is the Disney Treasures set of the very first 5 episodes. The weak points of this release are easy to point out. For one thing, these episodes are so short that much of the time is taken up by bad quality playings of cartoon shorts and, in the case of the first program, an intro to a serial that just makes us want to see it. I also feel like there were better guest and musical performances to be shared out there, though I don't have a great memory of the show to be more specific. Bottom line, a DVD of the Mickey Mouse Club really would work better with some hour long episodes if you're not going to give us complete seasons (which you really should, Disney). What the fans desire is more of the Mouseketeer performances (even if I called the Darlene one corny, as most of them are by today's standards) and the complete serials to view.  However, this doesn't mean we want them edited out of the show and presented on their own. That's... okay with the serials, but for the Mickey Mouse Club, we do want complete episodes (I enjoy the newsreels and other aspects of the show also), but preferably in chronological order and bigger bulk. C'mon, if some of the awful shows out there from television history get full DVD releases, why can't this one? And while you're at it, stop sitting on the Disney Afternoon shows too, and the Disney anthology show, and Honey I Shrunk the Kids the TV show... These ""Best Of"" discs just make the fan base that would be interested in purchasing them kinda mad. It works somewhat for Mickey Mouse Club though, since it's a variety show and not a situation program like, say, Goof Troop (which had one DVD release that was a joke), but those folks who will pay for this sample of the show they grew up loving will just as willing pay more for a larger collection, so give it to us already! The Treasures set was nice, but it was still just 5 episodes.

Oh, and before I forget, there are zero bonus features on this DVD. There's a shocker.",1329091200,5,4417,4.579746835443038

2254654,2,B0007Z9QXK,"I was enormously disappointed in this DVD. I had just reached the age of 5 when they were announcing the Mickey Mouse Club show. I don't think I ever missed an episode. I loved it, (had an enormous crush on Annette--but what boy at that time didn't?) What you have here are 5 half hours shows from the last season. Sadly even Talent Roundup Day was missing the great beginning of the earlier seasons when they sang ""Saddle your pony, here we go!""... Forget it... the tap-dance routine from Monday is shown instead.  I can never figure why they totally screwed up Circus Day's intro scene with Mickey. I recall distinctly that Mickey was saying ""Today is, ... uh... uh..."" and the kids in the background shouting ""Circus Day!"" to which he responded ""RIGHT!""... they've somehow or other dubbed it to a sequence making no sense at all, he greets the mousketeers then goes silent (while clearly still saying SOMETHING) then he shouts ""Right""! Go figure!  Also, the so-called ""dates"" for the 5 shows is completely false. I have no clue what those dates represent, but according to the menu, some are from the 60's, and the last year it showed on air was 58-59. These half-hour butcher jobs of the one hour MMC are pretty pitiful. But it's still nice to see the kids I sang and just plain enjoyed in those innocent days of the mid to late 1950's. Another disappointment was that while they had Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk INTRODUCE the NEW Hardy Boys serial (The Mystery Farm --or something akin to that)... not ONE serial show was on any of these.  All you get are 5 daily 30 minute (22 minutes sans commercials) shows--none of which link together cohesively. There was Monday (not sure if it actually was Fun with Music) then Tuesday: Guest Star Day  Wednesday: Anything can happen day -- Thursday -- Circus Day -- and Friday --Talent Roundup.  I gave it two stars simply on the nostalgia value.  As a good representation of what was a great show I would LOVE to have the complete season of-- I'd have given it a single star--and that would've been charity.",1270166400,5,2054,4.598360655737705

2254671,3,B0007Z9QXK,"I must admit, I am a Mickey Mouse Club junkie. As

soon as I noticed these reviews, good and bad, I knew

I had to see this DVD for myself. Just last Monday, it

was my privilege to attend the 50th anniversary

reunion of 10 original Mouseketeers at Disneyland, and

I was also privileged to share three passionate kisses

with my favorite Mouseketeer of all timne, Cheryl

Holdridge. The mere inclusion of the impossibly

beautiful Cheryl Holdridge on most of these shows is

worth the cost. The two complete programs from the

show's final network season are also better than

nothing, I suppose. By the third season, almost all of

the girls were beyond puberty and becoming quite

voluptuous. Doreen Tracey was a budding goddess.

Annette was Annette. Darlene Gillespie resembles the

Fox Sports wacko, Jillian Barberie.

That said, three of these episodes consist of shows

that were packaged when the Mickey Mouse Club went

into syndication, beginning in 19h2 and running

through 1964, which ironically was the year Cheryl got

married and was the last person to see Jimmie Dodd

alive as he was on the edge of death in a Hawaiian

hospital. The syndicated shows were definitely a

hodgepodge. Little or nothing has been done to improve

the video quality of these three shows. The ""Circus

Day"" production number bails out early, leaving me

with a very unsatisfied feeling. However, there are

some legitimate hiighlights for those who love the

Mouseketeers. The ""Anything Cah Happen Day"" features

the great Firehouse Five Plus Two Dixieland band,

featuring three of Disney's ""NIne Old Men"" from the

feature animation department. This troupe performed

regularly at Disneyland in those days, and the energy

they bring to the show is exceptional. The production

number dates from the first season and includes

spectacular dancing from little Sharon Baird, Bobby

Burges,, Bonni Kern and Lonnie Burr. It also showcases

the first year Mouseketeers to great effect.

Also notable is the Talent Roundup Day guest, a little

girl from Chicago named Cheryl Weinberg who was half

black and half Jewish. I have always insisted that the

real value of the Mickey Mouse Club was its philosophy

of INCLUSION. The Club spotlighted many black

youngsters on Talent Roundup Day, and Cheryl Weinberg

strikes me as a little Lena Horne. She joins Ronnie

and Riley Wilson in a great tap number after singing a

solo. This performance definitely deserves to be

ranked among the show's best.

I am also grateful for the Monday show which includes

the introductory chapter of the second Hardy Boys

serial, ""The Mystery of the Ghost Farm."" Tim Considine

and Tommy Kirk provide commentary for the serial that

was to follow. Carole Ann Campbell as Iola Morton and

Sarah Selby as Aunt Gertrude are also p;rominently

featuredf. Carole Ann was also beginning to develop

into a real beauty. Wish we could have seen more of

this serial.

All in all, this show provides a few glimpses into

what made the show so memorable for millions of baby

boomers. The Doddisms are included at the end of each

show, and Doreen Tracey gives a wonderful performance

of one of the staple songs, ""Beauty is As Beauty

Does."" Doreen has also been one of my secret crushes

for decades.",1128729600,41,3271,4.9097605893186005
2254672,2,B0007Z9QXK,"Some children's shows age well and retain their charm (""Stingray"" and ""Thunderbirds"" with their careful attention to detail, ""Gumby"" with its surrealism, ""Davey and Goliath"" with its classic moral lessons). I was looking forward to the Mickey Mouse Club on DVD as I had fond memories of watching it every afternoon after school. This has not aged well. ""Spin and Marty"" and ""The Hardy Boys"" serials are still enjoyable (they were both serialized on this program). The rest of this resembles an endless talent show put on at your local public school by some local kids. It isn't very entertaining. It gets tedious quickly. It moves very slowly.  The production numbers were expensive by children's show standards in the fifties but they look cheap and tacky by today's standards. Dull.

What a treat it would be to have these classic song and dance performances available. They could be released as Season One, Season Two, etc. I also know that fans would buy individual DVDs of the wonderful series such as Spin and Marty years 1, 2, and 3..The Hardy Boys, and especially the Annette series.

I thought maybe they'd throw in the color version of the animated opening. Nope.  The only thing in color are the obnoxious previews Disney puts on every product.  Even the color cover with Walt and the Mouseketeers leads you to believe there might be some color.  And yes, the prints are dingy.  Each episode appears to clock in at a little over 20 minutes.  Was something cut from each one?  They didn't show as many commercials in the 50s, so I can't imagine they were this short. And it is inexplicable why they give air dates of the 1960s for three of the five shows. I believe it  was off the air by 1959.  Look, for this price I don't expect perfection.  Notice the cover says Digitally Mastered, not Remastered.  But you do kind of expect a little bit more out a Disney product.  These barely rise above the level of kinescopes you have to view for a lot of 50s material. I didn't get the box set because I don't need that much, but this was a poor substitute.  If you just want to show a youngster what the show was like, you know, the famous songs at the beginning and end, then this is for you.
