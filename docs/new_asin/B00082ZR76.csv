2257397,4,B00082ZR76,"When Ann Sothern's Hollywood career started to stall, the lovely star focused her attention on television.  She appeared in several shows as well as a lavish TV production of Kurt Weill's LADY IN THE DARK, and THE ANN SOTHERN SHOW.  She also played the nosey Susie Camille MacNamara in the wonderful sitcom PRIVATE SECRETARY...

The sitcom PRIVATE SECRETARY featured Ann Sothern as Susie, the secretary to New York talent mogul Peter Sands (Don Porter).  However, Susie often gets confused as to the limitations of her job and gets frequently entangled in the lives of Peter and his clients.  Snappy dialogue and great comic support is provided by Ann Tyrrell as Susie's workmate Vi Praskins.  When the series later went into syndication, the title of the show was inexplicably changed to SUSIE.

This DVD from Alpha contains 4 great episodes (presented under the SUSIE title):

""What Every Secretary Knows"" - Susie gets embroiled with an opera bigwig when Peter tries to clinch a deal for two of his rising stars.

""How to Handle a Boss"" - Susie arranges for her journalist-boyfriend to act as her ghostwriter when she has to submit an important article for a magazine.

""Not Quite Paradise"" - Vi's aunt (guest star ZaSu Pitts) becomes convinced that Vi and Peter are engaged...and that Susie is the 'Other Woman'!

""Three's a Crowd"" - Susie finds herself sandwiched in a love triangle, comprising of a young playwright and a gunho Broadway producer.

Hopefully Alpha may release some more eps from this often-neglected sitcom in the future.",1120953600,,1542,4.98046875

8055559,3,B00082ZR76,"In this 50's TV comedy series, the private secretary to talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter), Susan Camille MacNamara (Ann Sothern) goes out of her way to help her boss in the most convoluted schemes. Some how she always puts her foot in it; yet in the end everything turns out fine.

Either a victim of old age or bad memory (possible the world has changed); I found this series to be straining for laughs.

The DVD volume one contains:
""What Every Secretary Knows""
""How to Handle the Boss""
""Not Quite Paradise""
""Three's a Crowd""

If you enjoyed the acting of Don Porter then you should not miss him in the Bob Hope classic ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)

The version I watched was distributed by alpha video and was not remastered (it really should have been). The images do not hold up well on today's big screen TV's",1507939200,,820,4.52027027027027

8055564,4,B00082ZR76,"Alpha have released 16 of the 104 installments in Ann Sothern's first stylish hit series. The price for these unrestored public-domain syndication prints is a steal, and you may as well own them all. This first volume includes the series' funniest permanent-keeper episode, as well as backup standbys with the wonderful Madge Blake and a sweet female-chauvinist Bermuda-shorts episode scripted by Leonard Gershe.

Even in these murky old prints the tradition of quality, quite unusual in quick-and-dirty 1950s television, glows through. Sothern brings genuine big-screen glamour to her first little-screen stint, a prestige production that ran on the Tiffany Network between 1953-57 in alternation with Jack Benny. Both household names thus had the luxury of star salaries, profitsharing and residuals but a halftime workload (as compared with Lucy or Gale Storm as FTEs) and both shared a wealthy sustaining sponsor, a major Durham-based tobacco company that too was a household name (neither Benny nor Sothern smoked in character in their series). The quaint period cigarette commercials were edited out in syndication, so too Ann Sothern's original title sequence which incorporated the tobacco giant's logo.

Star quality and Tiffany style aside, Susie MacNamara the Manhattan private secretary is a surprisingly emancipated, pre-Mary Richards, career bachelorette. She has her own view office, an IBM typewriter, pencils galore, a hard-won electric fan and an ongoing style parade of frocks, cinch belts, headbands and divine little hats. Her prospects are rosy, working in a glam talent brokerage with a slightly dim but marriageable boss Peter Sands (Don Porter) and her sororial second banana Vi Praskins, played with mousy assurance by the unique dialectician and character actress Ann Tyrrell. This series and its successor were Tyrrell's only significant work, and she appears--hilariously and stealing scenes with abandon--in every episode, making Alpha's four volumes essential for Tyrrell devotees or followers of Evergreen State actresses (Tyrrell was born in Whatcom County, and Sothern matriculated at the University of Washington to study classical music).

This is genteel wit-and-manners drawing-room comedy translated to the modern IBM office, not Lucy Ricardo physical slapstick, and Sothern and Tyrrell especially are perfectly rehearsed in their sisterly comedic pairing and split-second timing (the series was filmed without an audience to achieve perfectly calibrated timings and takes, a canned laughtrack dubbed in). The barbs and zingers are witty and pointed but never maliciously cruel. (Although Gershe suggests poor Vi is habitually ""beat, bothered and befuddled,"" Vi is actually a pretty smart cookie, a demon professional telephonist who even finds a spouse, as bachelorette Sothern will not, in the followup series.) It all comes together in the riotous keeper Episode 102, originally aired February 1957, ""Not quite paradise."" Two meddlesome old matchmaking biddies--ZaSu Pitts and Hope Summers at their most fluttery--host a romantic Canarsie home dinner for poor Vi and dashing but dim Peter, whom they expect will pop the question to happy but befuddled spinster Vi. Glamourously Susie, along for the ride, becomes poor Susie the fifth wheel, marginalized by the biddies to undesirable guest seating, characterization as a booze hound and wanton manchaser and finally whirling into a manic mambo sequence that pairs off weird couple Tyrrell and Porter and the very unlikely danceteam of Sothern and Pitts. This perfectly paced episode flows like honey, was made nearly but not quite to feature-film standards and has real star interplay in the equal screen time given Sothern, Tyrrell and La Pitts. Episode 102 alone makes this volume worthwhile, and the remaining 15 installments are nearly its equal in warmth, classic sitcom style and that fiercely loyal Sothern-Tyrrell sisterhood (Lucy and Ethel, rivals on and off screen, were never this genuinely chummy), stronger than any infatuation with any mere male--even one with great legs in Bermuda shorts.",1436054400,,4096,5.581993569131833

8055567,4,B00082ZR76,"Those of us who remember Ann Sothern's terrific performances in ""Private Secretary"" (later dubbed ""Susie"" in syndication) back in the 50s, and the stylish, glamorous New York celebrity life that was implied (though rarely directly shown) in the series can only be grateful that a handful of these classic TV comedies have been released on DVD.  Watching them is pure delight, and not just for nostalgic purposes.  The writing and acting are funny and sharp and the series -- despite its dated perspective on how a smart woman can handle a sometimes egotistical, always somewhat obstuse, male -- holds up remarkably well.

That's the good news. The bad news is the transfer to DVD is pretty dreadful.  The sound quality is especially bad: whenever there's music, the pitch wavers like a drunken burglar alarm.  It's actually painful to listen to.  In one of the episodes, a floating dark bar (rogue splicing tape?) dances through a scene or two.  In short, the whole product screams ""on the cheap.""

But the shows themselves are gems and it's a real treat to see Sothern and her superb supporting cast go through their paces once again.",1134604800,,1135,4.875
