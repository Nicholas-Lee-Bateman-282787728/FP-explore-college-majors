2892932,4,B000T28PUG,"Sure. It's not bad. This is not a show I'd would have considered on my own or even remembered to watch. My wife was watching & I stopped for a moment & stayed because Debra Messing is so excellent- fashion, comedy & drama. It's not marketed to us 50+  males but is a perfect, summer mini-series. It went to dvd pretty quick in case you missed it. I'd recommend it. Debra's scenes with Joe Montegna are the best.",1190160000,16,411,4.269230769230769
2892933,5,B000T28PUG,"You must forget Will & Grace when you watch the Starter Wife. Kiss Grace goodbye, this aint her. Messing shows how she can take the lead and keep this mini series moving. She plays an ex-wife of a Hollywood studio boss starts her life after her divorce

The supporting cast of Judy Davis, Joe Mantegna,  Anika Noni Rose (Dreamgirls), and Peter Jacobson (Transformers & the Lost Room)mesh with Messing. Mantegna best scene is hom in drag-DONT MISS IT

On the whole, the mini series, which is based upon the novel by Hollywood Wife  Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of Producer/director Brian Grazer, is a great story. It ranks up there will Jackie Collins's Hollywood series of books and movies

2892934,4,B000T28PUG,"I truly enjoyed this series, and I'm not even a 40-something starter wife that it seems this was written for.  Debra Messing powerfully showed the strength of being a female in today's world.  As a 30 year old, single woman, this story was inspiring to reclaim the person within to use my individuality as a strength and asset and find what makes me happy.  The strong performances from the entire cast made this pleasant, enjoyable, entertaining, and inspiring.  I strongly recommend it!",1187740800,6,488,4.914634146341464
2892935,1,B000T28PUG,"I was excited about this production.  But 15 minutes into it I had to ask myself WHY did they even bother?  Bad directing, horrible scripts, and extremely bad acting.  Save yourself the time and money!",1186876800,10,201,4.685714285714286
2892936,4,B000T28PUG,"This show wasn't mindblowing and it wasn't super original, but it had heart, something I think is missing from TV today. It surprised me that I could sit and just get lost in this show and its quirky characters. Debra Messing is a great actress and I love the fact that Anika Noni Rose played the security guard for the community. If you haven't seen this show in it's original network run, please pick up a copy or rent it from Netflix. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1183593600,27,479,4.393258426966292

Its interesting how she plays basically the same charector in this show as she does in the current ""Mysteries of Laura"".

2892997,5,B000T28PUG,"I don't understand how anyone would  be displeased with the Starter Wife! I just finished watching season two and thanks to Prime it was free. I had no real idea what it was about but was hooked right away because Debra Messing was the lead character and as far away from Will and Grace as you could get.  She proved herself in this one. She was funny and sad and hurt and angry and all the emotions played out over the two seasons. After her divorce from a bigshot in the movie business  she wanted to 'do it all.'  I really enjoyed all the characters and the dialogue was A-1.
Basically it's a story about a woman trying to be her true and independent self  with a lot of other 'stuff' going on with her friends. She is warm like 'Grace;'' loveable like 'Grace' and all the wit and charm you would expect from Debra.  If you have PRIME please give this a chance. I don't understand why in the world those who gave the show l or 2 or even 3 stars didn't like it but I've watched many many many (and many more than many) TV series and mini-series and though this isn't going to save the world it takes you away to another life and some great characters.  Check it out-you've nothing to lose! Happy Viewing",1405296000,,1205,4.235807860262009

2893003,5,B000T28PUG,This is one show I'm sorry didn't go anywhere. The Starter Wife could have easily gone many more seasons and Debra Messing was perfect as the wife.  The writing was exceptional and the content is extremely funny with an element of truth. I especially like Molly's friends ( their characters are varied enough to be very interesting) and after all where would we be without our friends. I might not experience her type of lifestyle but with this type of show I can easily relate.,1404777600,,478,4.623529411764705

2893036,3,B000T28PUG,"Nothing heavy...slightly silly but sweet.  If you are looking for something not heavy this is it. I watch it for filler time. So,if you don't have super high expectations, rent this!",1401321600,,182,4.870967741935484
2893037,3,B000T28PUG,I like this show. It is a bit silly but I enjoy the characters. Nice to watch on a rainy day.,1401235200,,93,3.4761904761904763
2893038,4,B000T28PUG,This is not a heavy hitter but it is pleasant enough and well acted enough to watch.  I have always liked Debra Messing and she does not disappoint.  The strangest thing is that they switch actors for her husband in the second season which takes some getting used to.  They always have a little fantasy at the beginning of each episode that is presented either as a dream or a daydream.  These are like dreams within a dream and a lot of effort goes into making them entertaining.  Somewhat on the light side but very well done in general! When you can't find something to watch that you LOVE I suggest taking a break with this sweet story.,1401062400,,640,4.389830508474576
2893039,5,B000T28PUG,The life of wealthy with their silly problems is always entertaining ;) good to unwind after work day with a glass of wine and some humor from Starter wife,1400716800,,155,4.379310344827586
2893040,5,B000T28PUG,"The first season was pretty funny, great characters and kept my interest however, the second season was awful and I barely made it through 3 episodes before I gave up.",1400716800,,167,4.6
2893041,4,B000T28PUG,The characters are interesting and well acted with consistency.  A tale of how keeping secrets does not make things easier.,1400544000,,123,5.15
2893042,3,B000T28PUG,Debra Messing is delightful to watch. The show is a bit trite. Very light and fluffy! Not compelling enough for my taste ...,1400544000,,124,4.434782608695652

2893044,4,B000T28PUG,It was pretty funny I like the fact that the character finally got her act together and moved back into her house.,1400457600,,114,4.2272727272727275
2893045,5,B000T28PUG,I was surprised how well written and entertaining this show was. Can't wait to watch Season 2. Great Cast and Writing.,1400371200,,118,4.666666666666667
2893046,5,B000T28PUG,"Love it!!!!!
I can so relate to this show and the whims of silly grown ups!
Debra is awesome in this role. Couldn't think of a better actress
or funnier characters!",1400198400,,164,4.32258064516129
2893047,5,B000T28PUG,"I loved the quirky characters and their escapades. Having family members in ""the business"" I can testify that a lot of Hollywood is exactly as portrayed- completely over the top and egocentric- blind to anything that isn't their milieu. I've had some experience with producers so consumed with themselves that they border on sociopathology. This was an accurate and funny portrayal. The acting was top notch!",1400112000,,408,5.196969696969697
2893048,5,B000T28PUG,"Love Debra Messing and she was great in this show.....only sorry the story-line looks to be a one-season thing.  With this title and what's happened so far, what would you do for more seasons?  If additional seasons are created I will be watching!",1400112000,,247,4.72093023255814
2893049,4,B000T28PUG,Good. Well done and good actors. The locations and sites used were up to standard of the rich and glamorous. Second season...don't bother watching. It's nothing like the first. Completely down hill.,1400112000,,198,5.21875
2893050,3,B000T28PUG,Was great till they switched two characters in season 2. Not as good now. I couldn't get into it anymore.,1400025600,,105,4.3
2893051,1,B000T28PUG,Watched the mini series and loved it but the tv show was too close to the mini series and I got bored,1399939200,,101,3.6363636363636362
2893052,1,B000T28PUG,"This was a very lackluster series. I tried to get into it, but it just couldn't capture my interest. I would recommend passing.",1399593600,,127,4.565217391304348
2893053,2,B000T28PUG,"Very shallow development of characters.  Each character is almost like a two-dimensional version of themselves.  I like the premise, but it is not well explored.",1399593600,,161,5.4
2893054,3,B000T28PUG,"The writing ain't great, the acting is nothing special, but it's still (mostly) a fun waste of time when you've run out of shows to stream.",1399593600,,139,4.384615384615385
2893055,3,B000T28PUG,I just started this series. It looks interesting so far. its just too early to give it a better review.,1399593600,,103,4.2

2893063,5,B000T28PUG,"I liked this one, surprisingly. I liked the acting, used to live in L.A. where things are over the top so was able to see how this was more my ""type"". My husband, however, and would quickly find his mind straying from it all.",1399334400,,225,4.136363636363637
2893064,3,B000T28PUG,It is an amusing show. Definitely don't have to think to watch. Not bad if you've had a hard day and don't want to concentrate.,1399334400,,127,4.12
2893065,3,B000T28PUG,"Excess and great clothes, made me laugh, my husband endured it and agreed to watch season 2.
Loved the sights maybe not the characters.",1399248000,,135,4.666666666666667
2893066,2,B000T28PUG,Wasn't enough there to keep me interested. Wasn't particularly funny or otherwise amusing and didn't really cut it as a serious drama either so neither here nor there in my opinion.,1399161600,,181,4.870967741935484
2893067,4,B000T28PUG,I liked the first season very much.  Actors make the characters believable.  Seeing a side of life that is foreign to me is interesting and I find myself evaluating the personalities of the characters.  Judy Davis and Debra Messing are great.,1398902400,,242,4.853658536585366
2893068,1,B000T28PUG,"Impossible to watch this series. The humor is so vapid, dialogue so mindlessly reinforcing horrible stereotypes of needy women and sleezy men, not to mention the entitlement all the characters carry in private islands of blind wealth. Will and Grace was great, but don't waste your time on this.",1398816000,2,295,5.040816326530612
2893069,2,B000T28PUG,"This is a silly soap opera type of series.  I watched the first episode and it was moderately entertaining and a tiny bit funny, but I think mostly women will like this.  I do think a lot of women would like this show.  The actors are pretty good.",1398816000,,247,4.104166666666667
2893070,5,B000T28PUG,I 'binge watched' season 1 and season 2 of the Starter Wife over the weekend and it was fun and entertaining.,1398729600,,109,4.238095238095238
2893071,1,B000T28PUG,"This show was poorly written, poorly cast, poorly acted and overall a bore. I think only people in the ""business"" could stand to watch this dribble. I am sorry that I spent any of my time watching this!  I watched it because of Debra Messing but not even she can save this show.",1398729600,,278,4.245283018867925

2893083,5,B000T28PUG,I absolutely loved this movie.  It was funny and sad and good all at the same time.  I would highly recommend it.,1398297600,,113,4.090909090909091
2893084,5,B000T28PUG,"As satisfying as reading a Nora Roberts while on the beach. The acting was what you would expect from a show headlined by Debra Messing, the story was good, if a bit fluffy. The only ""bad"" thing about it? the main character chose the wrong guy! At least in MHO",1398211200,,260,4.22
2893085,1,B000T28PUG,"It's completely my opinion, but this show was BORING.  There is no real story to follow and most of the actors leave a lot to be desired.",1398211200,,137,4.074074074074074
2893086,1,B000T28PUG,"I only watched the first episode, which ended with a guy apparently  going committing suicide. I never need watch the show again. Enough said",1398211200,,141,4.875
2893087,5,B000T28PUG,I watched this show when it first came on TV.  I loved watching it again.  Saw some things I missed when it first came on TV.  Can't wait to watch Season 2.,1398211200,,156,3.8125
2893088,5,B000T28PUG,I love how they include famous scenes from movies playing out in her mind! I was constantly surprised by the amount of actors that I never knew did this show!,1398124800,,158,4.3

2893103,4,B000T28PUG,"I love Debra Messing as an actress and was not expecting a mini series when I ordered this (I should have read the description better) but was pleasantly surprised when I watched it, I watched the whole thing through at once.",1397433600,,225,4.512195121951219
2893104,5,B000T28PUG,"I watched all the episodes on my Amazon Prime, which I thought only included the free two day shipping. I was watching a DVD, that I had purchased, when it was over I noticed the Amazon Prime icon on the TV,so I clicked on it with my remote.  Suddenly, I found a collection of TV shows I've never watched before. The shows that are available on ""ON Demand"" all have commercials, which you can't skip. Now I am able to watch episodes within their context.  What fun!  I enjoyed all episodes of Starter Wife because they were well written and the storyline has twists and humor that 'hook'.  I wish it had lasted longer.  Amazon Prime is really great for offering pilots and new series. The only frustration I have is that the networks don't continue the series after the first year.",1397347200,,781,4.471830985915493
2893105,5,B000T28PUG,Great cast and great plot line - really funny sitcom about the neuvo-riche of Hollywood studios  star system and the mess they canmake of their lives.,1397347200,,150,4.769230769230769
2893106,2,B000T28PUG,"Couldn't make it through the first episode. Not awful, but not good. Nothing truly interesting happens, just a lot of super cheesy interactions with possible love interests.",1397260800,,173,5.444444444444445
2893107,4,B000T28PUG,"It's entertaining without being overly dramatic, cheesy or predictable like most shows these days. I didn't care too much for the first episode, but I'm glad I kept watching it, even though sometimes I though it was an OK show.",1397174400,,227,4.7
2893108,5,B000T28PUG,Love this series!  Highly recommend for fun watching! I watched the entire season back to back.  It was like a book I couldn't put down!,1397174400,,136,4.4
2893109,4,B000T28PUG,"Lots of viewing fun, especially if you read the book.  Writing so, so and acting kitschy & a little stiff (sorry Stephen Moyer), but really fun to watch.  Debra Messing terrific and funny.  Judy Davis rules!",1397088000,,207,4.694444444444445
2893110,4,B000T28PUG,"I had no idea there was a tv series! I read the book and loved it and was so excited to watch it when I found it on amazon prime.

2893112,3,B000T28PUG,She is young and very beautiful and a good actress. But the nonsensical plot left you wanting something more concrete than buddies and some homosexual stuff. Why is Hollywood doing so much to promote the lifestyle.,1396915200,,214,4.972222222222222

2893134,5,B000T28PUG,"I usually eschew any celebrity type T.V. shows,but this one caught and kept my interest. The excess and vanity of Hollywood is all too evident; but,the close personal frienships (with all their ups and downs) in this story line is compelling.",1396915200,,242,4.926829268292683

2893137,5,B000T28PUG,The characters are pretty funny.  I think the end part with Lou was a bit of a strech but it was entertaining.,1396569600,,110,4.0
2893138,4,B000T28PUG,I thoroughly enjoyed it Deborah Messing was wonderful with a great cast of characters I am only hoping there is a second season. I hated it to end.,1396137600,,147,4.285714285714286

2893184,3,B000T28PUG,"Hard to relate to the Hollywood crowd, very shallow characters portrayed. Good type of series to watch when one doesn't want to view anything of substance and doesn't like to read. It's about a junior high school level of entertainment and interpersonal exchanges.
I'm being generous in the review as I won't be watching any more of the series so don't know if it gets better.",1393891200,,376,4.712121212121212

2893191,5,B000T28PUG,I have always loved Debbie since Ned and Stacy. She has the comedic timing of Lucy and the writers have given her a a great platform in which to showcase her talent. The rest of the cast are wonderful as well. I do get tired of Hollywood always type casting gay men as fussy interior designers though- it is an insult to homosexuals.,1393286400,,333,4.301587301587301

2893234,5,B000T28PUG,This is where it all began. It was a great story and miniseries. Molly's journey takes us on a wild ride. I loved the scenes from Malibu and the entire cast was wonderful. A Hollywood wife left for a younger model and how she deals with that is heartbreaking and freakin' funny!,1392336000,,278,4.365384615384615

2893258,2,B000T28PUG,Good looking actress while the story is rubbish. There isn't story telling but it doesn't matter because the director and writer thought audience are idiots and they don't care whether audience thinks the plot makes sense. They like to over simplify people and stereotype characters. Regret seeing this one.,1389657600,,307,5.285714285714286

Season 2 switched actors for the bad husband who divorced his wife in season 1.  I am having a hard time disliking that character in season 2.  I preferred season 1's husband.

2893304,4,B000T28PUG,Debra Messing's character is really great on the show. This first season had many things happen in only a few episodes that might make it hard for there to still be a good story line next season.

2893357,4,B000T28PUG,"I watched an episode once a day during my lunch break for both seasons.

The story is cute and somewhat predictable. She juggles too many men for my taste.

Messing is totally playing her 'Grace' character from ""Will & Grace."" There is even a gay, outgoing friend that resembles 'Will.' The setting is California, even the fashion is about the same.

The show could relate to you in some ways:divorce, being a single mom, being rich then suddenly poor, etc.

The setting is beautiful, the beach life if basically the first season.

If you have nothing else to watch, I would recommend it.",1383696000,,588,4.669902912621359

Also, the divine Stephen Moyer left, probably to join the cast of True Blood. Lots of plot twists that distinguished the show and its characters were inexplicably reversed, leaving the viewer to wonder what had happened to some of the major players.

But this first season stands alone as a gem: something to watch and take comfort from if you've just been drive-by divorced.",1383091200,,587,4.929292929292929

2893395,3,B000T28PUG,"I watched this with interest. It is at times funny. It is enjoyable and entertaining. At times, I found myself laughing. At other times, the heroine portrayed by talented Messing needed some backbone. Her character is far from being a strong woman and I couldn't relate to her at all, because of this. She gave her cheating ex-husband too much when she should have made him pay.
The best part of the series is when her ex-husband to be takes a bit too much Viagra in hopes of getting it on with his young girlfriend when he proposes marriage that night. The girlfriend obviously turned him down since he's left with a five hour ""arousal"" and calls his ex-wife to be. The plot is pretty predictable and leaves much to the imagination.
Judy Davis as one of her best friends makes his whole mini-series enjoyable, as does the male friend.
Overall, it's entertaining to watch at least once, unless like me you stand watching a show where the woman is stepped all over with.",1377129600,,969,4.574712643678161

She's adorable and real. As another venue for her best friend to be a gay man (Will and Grace; Smash), she scores points for continuing to do work where main characters are gay. I didn't give the show a higher rating because although I thoroughly enjoy it, I wouldn't call it a work of art or in a class of its own. Lots of fun, though!",1373500800,,491,4.3478260869565215

There is so much mediocre to bad programming that I am truly amazed when I find a show such as ""The Starter Wife.""  It has heart, great acting, witty and insightful dialogue, fun and clever inserts of classic movie scene reinactments/dream sequences.  The story centers around hollywood and the over-the-top lifestyles of the ""in"" crowd.  I was less involved in the story but instantly loved the characters and wanted to stay with them for the next episode.  Too bad this one wasn't continued.  Watch it, if only for the brilliant acting of Debra Messing and  Judy Davis.",1368921600,,667,4.698275862068965

2893488,5,B000T28PUG,Loved Debra Messing in Will & Grace and I love her in this series. I had read the book prior to watching it during its original airing and thought it was a great adaptation. It's slightly quirky with its movie-inspired nuggets that move the plot line along. Overall it's a great show to enjoy as a guilty pleasure.,1366329600,,314,4.431034482758621

2893492,4,B000T28PUG,This season is definitely funny and enjoyable to watch.  It isn't high quality tv but I had fun watching the drama unfold and the scenery is great- it makes me want to go to California right now.  Sadly it looks like Season 2 isn't as good.,1365811200,,240,4.195652173913044

2893510,5,B000T28PUG,"This is a smart, fun series. Big name actors, great sets, story lines that are just over the top enough so you don't always burst out crying when one of the characters experiences a stab to the heart. It has a lot of froth on top of substantial material - you can pick and choose the levels you feel like indulging with any given episode. It looks as if the actors are genuinely friendly, they're ""generous"" in that way that great actors seem to be. Nobody hogs the stage, no one character is so overwhelming, the rest are reduced to bit players. This is an adult comedy, as real as an axiety attack, as flippant as a revenge heart attack. They go for the funny bone and hit it - often. It's one of the few series I'd buy in DVD form because there really is more content underneath the obvious. I could watch it again. I wish it had gone five years. It deserved to.",1361145600,,865,4.216867469879518

2893553,5,B000T28PUG,"I loved the miniseries and thought I would have to be content with just those 6 episodes, so I was thrilled to see a whole other season of terrific characters, stories and sets.

Debra Messing stars as a newly divorced wife of a (once) powerful Hollywood mogul who has fallen off his golden pedestal. The show is delicious social satire, set in the excesses of uber-rich Hollywood, but the themes apply to any society - friendship, honesty, loyalty, decency, contrasted with social climbing, backstabbing, greed, jealously and posturing. It all takes place in the wealthy stratosphere of Hollywood society, so you can count on gorgeous sets, cars and clothes and dreamy California scenery. Messing is hilarious, moving, and refreshing as the lead, and she has a wonderful supporting cast.

Messing's husband was played brilliantly by Peter Jacobson in the mini-series, perfectly cast as a nebbishy, self-serving jerk. He left Starter Wife for a role in House and is sorely missed in Season 1. The show is still great fun. Highly recommended to all.

Definitely watch the miniseries first. It is excellent and is an essential part of the story line.",1253404800,3,1148,5.031578947368421

I found it interesting that the actor who played her ex, Kenny, in the mini-series is not the same guy that plays him in the series and I found it funny that the original actor was probably a good 10-15 or so years older than the series actor.  I am sure that they didn't anticipate that it would take off like it did and they'd have a full-fledged series on their hands, so the major changes are totally understandable.

I love Molly's character, and another example of how much better it gets in the series is that I didn't really understand her character or really like it all that much in the mini-series, which was a shock to me because I LOVE her in the series.

2893560,5,B000T28PUG,"The Starter Wife is one of the best TV series ever written. Season One took a mediocre book (which I read *after* I watched S1) and made a fabulous show. Debra Messing is a consummate actress who has hit her stride in TSW. Her interpretation of Molly Kagan -- wife, ex-wife, mother, and budding woman -- is just brilliant. It's hard to see how she can top this -- oh, wait, she has -- TSW2 is even better than TSW1. Judy Davis is wonderful as her dear friend Joan, a snarky lush trapped in an open marriage, and Chris Diamantopoulos as Rodney, a gay man looking for Mr. Right, shine in both seasons as part of Molly's inner circle. Peter Jacobson is delightfully obnoxious as TSW Ex-Spousal Unit Kenny whose world revolves around him and his male member who together cause the initial disruption in Molly's seemingly perfect Hollywood life, while Joe Mantegna plays Lou, the guy every woman wants to meet and many of them have married (evidenced by a succession of unsuccessful marriages). He's in love with being in love with Molly, and he is her best straight male friend. If there's a drawback to TSW, it's the mysterious homeless man Sam with whom Molly falls in love. He wasn't a great character in the book and doesn't improve much in this much improved series. British actor Stephen Moyer is miscast as the sulky beachbum with a past. The only attraction between Sam and Molly is the fact that he is shiftless, whereas Kenny is dedicated to furthering is career, even if it's at the expense of his marriage. Sam is as self-centered as Kenny, and his life philosophy doesn't invite interest in his backstory. It came as a big relief to learn that Sam doesn't show up in TSW2. At its most basic, The Starter Wife is evidence that a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.",1231804800,2,1790,4.527777777777778

Love the beach scenes,and Beverly Hills  This is a great DVD set, and now my daughter and my son's girlfriend want this for Christmas.",1228003200,,289,4.452830188679245
2893575,5,B000T28PUG,"Too cute to pass up!  Very entertaining with enough plot substance to merit re-watching.  Great collateral story lines with a wonderful supporting cast.  Plus, this series is real eye candy for those who enjoy Debra Messing's elegant wardrobes.",1214179200,,244,5.368421052631579
2893576,4,B000T28PUG,I love any shows that are LA/Hollywood themed. I would have to say this is not as good as the likes of Entourage/Dirt but it was a fun watch- quite cute.,1209254400,,153,3.967741935483871
2893577,4,B000T28PUG,I got this movie for very cheap on sale and was not expecting much however i was delighted to see how great it is.  If you like Debra then get this movie!!,1208563200,,155,3.84375
2893578,5,B000T28PUG,"I really enjoyed this mini-series.  I want to find out what happens to the characters since I've invested myself in the story line.  What happens to Sam?  What about the guard and her grandmother?  And Cricket's husband - does he get ""caught"" in his deception?  These stories and more I would love to see completed.

I also love the humor - sometimes very subtle (girls lunch out) and sometimes laugh-out loud (remember ""Bambi""?).  But the story has, as someone else has already pointed out, heart.  It's a wonderful story that needs to go on!

Buy this video and watch it frequently.  You'll get something different with each viewing.",1206576000,,635,4.796296296296297

2893581,5,B000T28PUG,"I missed this movie when it was on TV, so I made my husband rent it.  He said ""oh no, not another chick flick!"" He deceided to watch it with me, and guess what, he loved it and said it was one the of the funniest chick flicks he ever said.....he he he",1198713600,6,251,3.7358490566037736
2893582,5,B000T28PUG,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Starter Wife,"" even though it isn't the type of show I usually watch. It was a delight -- lots of chuckles, with enough serious subject matter to keep it from being a dramatized version of the Shopping Channel. Deborah Messing is perfect as the ""starter wife"" who's dumped by her studio honcho husband and thinks her life is over. Not so -- a new life is just beginning. Messing and her small coterie of loyal friends are great, and the hunk she finds on the beach is a feast for the eyes. The miniseries is great fun, guaranteed to bring a smile.",1193270400,10,573,4.415094339622642

8207489,5,B000T28PUG,"Read the book and when I went to get it on audio (to play in my car) I found out there was a special with Debra Messing. I received it on Amazon and enjoyed it immensely. I watched the whole thing in one afternoon.  The cast is great. In fact, it was as I imagined them when I read the book.. I would recommend it to anyone.  I am so feed up with the violence you see everywhere.  This is good entertainment.  Sheila",1448323200,,416,3.9759036144578315
