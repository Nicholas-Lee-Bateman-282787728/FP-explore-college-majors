8307170,5,B001GTZZCW,"Bought this for my husband, because we saw the Flying Scotsman on our trip to England.  The Scotsman was being repaired and refurbished.  The DVD took us back to the shop where we saw the repairs being done.  My husband loved the DVD.  And, if you haven't been to the Royal Railroad Museum in York, England you will get an idea of the variety of vintage trains that you will see there.  And, they are kept in immaculate condition.  Don't miss this DVD if you love trains.",1477180800,,471,4.35632183908046
