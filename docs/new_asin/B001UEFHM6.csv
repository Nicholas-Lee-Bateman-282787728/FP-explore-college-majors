8343469,5,B001UEFHM6,"This has got to be the most visually rich of the TD DVD's I have seen so far.
The venue is set in an old castle. The singer's costumes are remarkable. The blend of visual overlay of light show effects with the singers is well done.
Yes, Iris Camaa can do more than play drums, she in fact sings quite well, although she is mostly playing drums in this DVD. Edgar & Jerome provide the music that is perfect for this ""Light Opera"" IE Visual Opera. I enjoyed also the extra ""behind the scenes"" interviews by each of the players and singers. This is not your ""Usual"" Tangerine Dream by any means (seems strange to use the word ""Usual"" with TD) but I have to say I would not mind at all seeing more of this type work from TD in the future. I think this is one that I can show to non TD type friends that they will enjoy from the more ""Rock Opera"" Venue.",1359072000,2,848,4.083832335329341
