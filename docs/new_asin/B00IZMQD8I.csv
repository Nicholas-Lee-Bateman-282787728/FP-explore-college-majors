8646852,5,B00IZMQD8I,the high def  treatment and updating the artwork has made this a series worth buying. but they need to lower the price.,1429142400,,119,4.409090909090909
8646853,5,B00IZMQD8I,"There are ONLY 4 Episodes on this disc. *Not the whole season* And..... there's only 3 discs available to purchase, even at $50 bucks a pop. Making 12 episodes out of 26. (Wrap your heads around that?) At least that is the only problem, the trouble is.... it's just such a large one! The show, however is beyond words. Such a brilliant update to this classic show. I seen the classic version so many times, and watching this, I was gripped. It's better then I ever could have hoped -- other then the fact that I won't be able to see it all the way through to the end....... WHICH KINDA SUCKS!

Hey, at least Nova's not the only woman on board anymore.",1423440000,3,651,4.2926829268292686
8646854,5,B00IZMQD8I,Tried watching the original years ago and just couldn't get past the old school animation. This remake is a godsend. I feel like a 10 year old kid again. This blu ray is amazing. The sound effects sound like they're pulled straight from the 70s anime which is fantastic. The music is beautiful. I think the mix of traditional animation for the characters an cg for the ships is perfect. I do wonder if it's worth the extra $$$ for the blu rays or if I won't be satisfied with the DVD version. It would be kinda cool to have the option of a dubbed version (original English voice actors) and would be the only thing I'd like to add to this outstanding disc. Highly recommended for any sci fi fan. This blows Star Wars/Trek away (love them both too).,1417996800,2,748,4.35
8646855,5,B00IZMQD8I,"Awesome, incredible, beautiful... Wish the English voices from the original actors were on it.  Forever Star Blazers!",1417651200,2,117,5.882352941176471
8646856,5,B00IZMQD8I,"Really liked it. I watched the broadcast TV version back in the day, and this is a great ""remake"".
Price is a little high, but worth it if you don't mind Japanese language with English subs. I'm not a big time Japanime fan anymore, but I am assuming that most hardcore fans would prefer Japanese VOs anyway.

One other thing that I didn't care for are the CG portions. Would rather have full traditional animation for everything, but it's not a big deal.

Worth getting for any Starblazers fan or fans of Japanese cartoons in general.",1416355200,3,534,4.552083333333333
8646857,5,B00IZMQD8I,Beautiful animation and a beautiful remake all together.  If you don't like subtitles then this is not for you.,1414195200,,111,4.842105263157895
8646858,5,B00IZMQD8I,The delivered product was as good as expected. Over priced but well executed and delivered. The price point precludes any additional purchases at this time.,1411430400,,156,5.28
8646859,5,B00IZMQD8I,Star Trek could only dream of being this good. It'll knock your socks off as they fight for their lives.,1403913600,2,104,4.25
