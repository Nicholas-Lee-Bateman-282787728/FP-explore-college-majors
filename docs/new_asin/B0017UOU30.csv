And though it should stand out enough on its own merits, I appreciate how an actor like Depp put his name out there as involved, to help build the audience, but then didn't actually make the film somehow about him!

Worth the watch! Worth owning!

A few years back, five groups of musicians and performers from four different countries - India, Romania, Macedonia and Spain - yet all united by their common gypsy heritage, set off on a six-week tour through North America that came to be known as the Gypsy Caravan.  Albert Maysles' ""When the Road Bends: Tales of a Gypsy Caravan"" is a documentary account of that tour.

The movie makes it clear that gypsy music has its roots firmly planted in personal hardship and social protest, that it is an organic response to the bigotry and oppression gypsies have suffered under from time immemorial.

The filmmakers spend much of their time interviewing the performers either behind-the-scenes at rehearsals or on the bus the group travels on from one location to the next. It is here that we see the camaraderie that develops among the members, as well as the personal conflicts and artistic disputes that are an inevitable part of any group activity.  But it is when they are all on stage, performing to packed houses in cities like New York, Miami, San Francisco, etc., that we feel the sheer joy that comes from sharing one's passion with an enraptured audience.

The moviemakers also travel to some of the performers' native towns and villages to try and get a feel for who these people truly are and the lands and cultures from which they spring.

The result is a moving, informative, and musically enriching glimpse into a people and an art form that few Westerners know much, if anything, about.",1278201600,3,1507,4.795366795366795
3175548,4,B0017UOU30,"This documentary movie is a wonderful representation of Gypsy culture and music, and of the fact that Gypsy culture IS music, from small childhood on to the literal grave. The filmmakers could not have predicted that one of the patriarchs would die during this amazing gathering of many nations' clans to produce music on tour, but that is what happens, and it is very moving to see and hear the grief in music. As impressive as the individual clans are in their varied national adaptations of Gypsy life, even more so is how they adapt to one another in the course of this production. Even the producers are awed. And it is no small bonus to see Johnny Depp acknowledging his own Gypsy history -- nor to hear that, like American Indians, Gypsies have been wronged for centuries.  It's high time for reparation.",1274140800,2,811,4.671328671328672
3175549,5,B0017UOU30,"This documentary, which chronicles a concert tour of amazingly talented Roma people from several different countries, is already a favorite at our house.  There are too many ""good"" parts to mention them all, but here are a few: Gypsy Esma, both singing and reminiscing; a fabulous aunt(Juana)-nephew Flamenco duo; Nikolai the Romanian elder statesman of the violin; a young Indian man who dances quite remarkably on his knees; there's even an interview with Johnny Depp recounting his experiences while making the film, ""The Man Who Cried.""

3175550,3,B0017UOU30,"This is the Roma version of ""The Buena Vista Social Club."" It follows a six-week, cross-country tour of the United States and Canada of five gypsy bands, two from Romania and the others from Macedonia, Spain and India. At almost two hours, it's too long. We get to see them perform, hear the wide variety of their music and we get to know the musicians and see them in their homes.
The music is pretty good for those who like this kind of thing but the discussion of the problems facing Roma is very superficial and avoids the big issues.
Having lived in Romania for a year, I know a little about these problems. Roma live in great poverty and suffer from some of the same problems as Native Americans -- high degrees of unemployment and abuse of drugs and alcohol. One sees their very young children begging in the streets every day, pestering passersby with great persistence. I was attacked and bitten by a Roma dog guarding an abandoned building in which they were squatting. There is also the big stereotype -- thievery. Of course not all gypsies are thieves -- far from it. But some are. One can find them picking pockets in almost every railroad station in Europe.
This movie does show the son of one of the Romanian musicians getting married to a 13-year-old girl who sits at the wedding smoking furiously. This passes without any comment as if it's totally normal and acceptable.
Bottom line: watch this movie for the music, not for the insight.",1234396800,11,1454,4.596153846153846
3175551,5,B0017UOU30,"GYPSY CARAVAN is a superb film that transports you to distinctly different corners of the globe musically, while traveling the United States on a journey led by five amazing ""Gypsy"" musical groups who are often separated by language, but connected by culture. The cinematography is rich and the sensitivity that Jasmine Dellal brings to her project is infectious and you embrace each of the five bands and dancers.

3175552,5,B0017UOU30,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  An incredible capture of different gypsy cultures and their music (they're really ONE culture, that has spread out through Western Europe and the Middle East).  Having grown up in southern Spain and attended elementary school and high-school there, this movie quite moved me.  It flooded me with all sorts of memories and emotions, of a people very enlightened, who almost intentionally reject this
""cerebral era"" that we live in, and choose to look towards miracles in every day life.

Having sat in elementary school with numerous gypsy kids it was great to watch these groups of gypsies traveling through the U.S. on tour.  In multiple instances I burst out into laughter watching them interact with our American culture.

To end my review and most importantly, this movie is about music.  Gypsy music.  Which is pure spirit and emotion.  I hope you enjoy this movie.",1216080000,13,902,5.04054054054054
3175553,5,B0017UOU30,"The premise here is very simple: 4 countries, 5 bands, and a 6 week tour of the US/Canada circa 2001 by filmmaker Jasmine Dellal (""American Gypsy: A Stranger In Everybody's Land""). The bands represent different styles of Roma/Gypsy music coming together at a crossroads of diasporic jamming. This film has the feel of ""Festival Express"" meets ""The Last Waltz"", but with better music and some awe inspiring stage performances!

The bands come from Rajasthan, India (Maharajah), Macedonia (Esma Redzepova/Ensemble Teodosievski), Spain (Antonio El Pipa), and two are from Romania (Taraf de Haidouks and Fanfare Ciocarlia). For those who've seen the films of Tony Gatlif, Emir Kusturica, or the films ""The Man Who Cried"" and ""Borat"", the Romanian bands will sound very familiar to you because their music has been featured in these films. The sounds represent flamenco, brass, orchestra-ensemble, strings, laments, and ragas...an incredibly mixed bag over the Romani diaspora and even centuries. As for the dance, amazing.

It must be said that the music is phenomenal, these musicians give truly  transcendent performances. For me, it's the interactions between these acts and the glimpses into their respective lives/homelands that take this from being just another concert film to a pure delight. There's so much joy here...joy in the music and with each other and the joy given to the audiences watching. You get to see where the music comes from in terms of experiences and history....how each land influenced it's musicians as much as the musician have influenced it.

These folks really had great fun and enjoyed each other's company, this is evident and great to watch. They seemed so intrigued by the music of their counterparts and so interested in the similarities to their own. The band that seemed most popular and intriguing to all the musicians were the Rajasthanis, Maharajah, who brought the roots. All of this mutual interest produced a not-to-be-missed jam-filled finale.

As for Johnny Depp, he's in this documentary for about 2-3 minutes.  He appears in connection with the band Taraf de Haidouks. He counted them as friends and he worked with them on ""The Man Who Cried"" becoming a huge fan and acquiring a fedora habit. They appeared at The Viper Room. He wanted his name to not appear in promotion of this film for fear of overshadowing it. It's not about him, so Depp fans buy this knowing it's 3 mins of him and 2 hrs of great Roma music. Nicolae Neascu, the leader of Taraf de Haidouks, has a rather amusing comment on the subject. The Taraf seem to have gained a few more famous admirers in Iggy Pop and Jim Jarmusch via JD.

This film is a wonderful introduction to Roma/Gypsy music and very entertaining in general. Watching this has definitely made me seek out more of the artists' work and led to deeper interest in Roma cultures and people. This film inspires, showing beauty can emerge from any situation, no matter how harsh.",1212710400,37,2956,4.983772819472617
3175554,5,B0017UOU30,"The Roma people are little known, like the wind ranging over the earth, transformative and invisible, but felt unless you never leave your domicile.  Not surprising,  Johnny Depp's glance with a Roma troupe resulted in lifelong changes, I think especially for him. The film follows many living threads of ""gypsy"" culture and music, which had been unaware of each other, having dispersed to distant lands, and naturally evolved musically with different ways.  The phenomenal idea actualized and here documented: a colloborative concert bringing family together, who sing, play, and dance their way along time and continents all home to the roma.  There is nothing simple about portraying any people, but these people and the filmmakers are undeniable in their authenticity. This film can contribute to anyone's experience and understanding of our humanity.",1210377600,13,855,5.454545454545454

They are from Macedonia, India, Spain and Romania and whilst all have different sounds, they all have the same passion with intense emotions and explosions of musical depth of feeling.
They follow the bands on tour and also tell their often intimate stories from their homeland. The crushing poverty for a lot of them seems to be totally alleviated by the sheer joy in the music.

They all have a massive love of life which seems contagious and they all seem to smoke at every possible moment. There is a lovely interview with Jonny Depp who has worked with some of them in the past and just adores them.

I thought I was going to find this dull and preachy, it is neither, so why the 4 stars, well that is because I would have liked more of the music. There is not one entire song, which I know is the way documentaries are done, but it is so spellbinding I found it quite distracting, when I am getting taken up in the music and: they cut to an interview.

Still petty gripe aside I have been telling friends about this and now they are all asking to borrow it - I am of course advising them about the current great deals on Amazon! (That should stop unwanted emails.)

Not only does it include perfromance of the tour, but a series of in-depth interviews with the musicians, tour organizers, etc.  Add to this mix, footage of the musicians in their home towns and you have a documentary reminiscent of ""Latcho Drom"". A particularly poignant sequence includes the funeral of Taraf violinist Nicolae Neacsu, who apparently died during the tour.  It was in his native village, Clejani in Romania. It tends to be a little long but I honestly wouldn't know where to cut it.
It is definitely worth buying and watching it multiple times (as I have done with Latcho Drom).  It is a pity that Latcho Drom has not been released on DVD.",1327190400,,701,4.637096774193548

Over the course of the film, I felt I had gotten an authentic taste of the cultures of the various groups - they are quite different - and some of the ""stars"" of the groups. When one of them dies before the end of the tour, his group returns to their native land for a wake which I needed, too, I had come to love him that much.
Roma have been unjustly maligned all over the world and for a long time. They all live ""some"" place, but they have no homeland. Perhaps they have infused their music with the joy that is usually attached to a homeland because it is a joyous caravan, indeed.",1306713600,2,861,4.288343558282208

Also if you enjoy this check out this fantastic film Black Cat - White Cat&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Cat-White-Cat-Import-All-Regions-English-Subtitles/dp/B004GL0ED2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Cat , White Cat [Import ,All Regions, English Subtitles</a>]",1336867200,,1708,4.839041095890411
3410056,5,B0017UOU30,"What a real treat for lovers of Gypsy music. Not only does it include perfromance of the tour, but a series of in-depth interviews with the musicians, tour organizers, etc.  Add to this mix, footage of the musicians in their home towns and you have a documentary reminiscent of ""Latcho Drom"". A particularly poignant sequence includes the funeral of Taraf violinist Nicolae Neacsu, who apparently died during the tour.  It was in his native village, Clejani in Romania. It tends to be a little long but I honestly wouldn't know where to cut it.
It is definitely worth buying and watching it multiple times (as I have done with Latcho Drom).  It is a pity that Latcho Drom has not been released on DVD.",1327190400,,701,4.637096774193548
3410057,5,B0017UOU30,This is a great film. A lot of music and some documentary of the Roma(Gypsy) Caravan tour. I would recommend this film and Latcho Drom(Safe Journey) if you are interested in the Roma music and lifestyle.,1324944000,,203,4.666666666666667
3410058,4,B0017UOU30,"A really enlightening look at the history and origins of the gypsy culture-the varying degrees of acceptance, the differing styles of music, dress, culture. The Queen of the Gypsies? She's here, check it out.",1316822400,,208,5.147058823529412
3410059,5,B0017UOU30,"This film follows a tour in the U.S. of several Roma (gypsy) groups from Romania, India, Spain, and Macedonia. They all speak the same verbal language but not the same musical language. By the conclusion of the tour, they are able to come together in a musical extravaganza.
Over the course of the film, I felt I had gotten an authentic taste of the cultures of the various groups - they are quite different - and some of the ""stars"" of the groups. When one of them dies before the end of the tour, his group returns to their native land for a wake which I needed, too, I had come to love him that much.
Roma have been unjustly maligned all over the world and for a long time. They all live ""some"" place, but they have no homeland. Perhaps they have infused their music with the joy that is usually attached to a homeland because it is a joyous caravan, indeed.",1306713600,2,861,4.288343558282208
3410060,4,B0017UOU30,Very interesting glimpse at life on the road with gypsy travellers from all over. I enjoyed the music and the rest of the movie very much. I have my own copy now. I need to remove it from my wishlist here but I don't know how.,1298246400,,226,3.9347826086956523
3410061,5,B0017UOU30,A personable film showing the varied experiences of some very similar yet different touring gypsy bands.  It was both entertaining and informative.,1296691200,,147,5.681818181818182

8267354,5,B0017UOU30,"I think it was Tony Gatlif who said 'my native land is the road'. 'Gypsy' (maybe Roma is less offensive) music represents an incredibly vast arch of sound, stretching from Rajastan to the Gibraltar. So to speak of it is meaningless, not much different from the hapless term of 'black music'. It has more to do with someone's concern with the race of the musicians rather than the music they make.
You will be treated to excellent product coming from Asia, the Balkans and finally the south of Spain. And to some bits of Roma life, which is not easy, given the poverty and prejudice that are still prevalent in many parts of Europe.",1493424000,,631,4.543859649122807

On the concert tour bus together, they come to find kinship and music and dance in each other.",1394150400,,249,4.790697674418604
8267360,5,B0017UOU30,"I can't watch many movies repeatedly, but had to order this when Netflix streaming stopped offering it. The music is beautiful, and the people featured endearing. Well made, easy to watch, and delightful to listen to. A must for anybody with an eclectic taste in music. I bought it to watch with my dad and musician friends. The Rajasthan dancer from Maharajah is stunning. There is one tearjerking scene, but the rest of the movie is very uplifting.
If you've got any Roma blood in you, it will make you proud. If you don't, it will make you wish you did...",1387324800,,558,4.534653465346534
8267361,3,B0017UOU30,"Picks up the threads that began with Tony Gatliff's brilliant music documentary ""Latcho Drom"" and weaves them into a new and exciting story about the music and the lives of the musicians, both in their native lands and on the road. There is often not enough extended concert footage for my taste, even though the back stories are great. There is enough for me recommend it to anyone interested in real traditions of music... not some World Cafe pipe dream of a record producer. The traditions are not watered down in the process of promoting and selling this music, which is rare.",1372896000,3,580,4.696078431372549
