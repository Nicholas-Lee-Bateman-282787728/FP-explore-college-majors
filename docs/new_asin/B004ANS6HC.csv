4310201,5,B004ANS6HC,"The Bob Hope Christmas Specials were always fun, funny, and sentimental.  We loved watching as joyful entertainment was brought to our service men who couldn't be home for Christmas.",1289606400,6,182,5.275862068965517
4310202,5,B004ANS6HC,"I vividly remember the Bob Hope Christmas specials when I was a kid. I found them odd by nature, as it's essentially a USO style collection of performances for servicemen during the Vietnam War. I always thought it was very nice of Bob Hope to fly all over the world, and to go to unpleasant war zones to entertain the troops. Bob is the king of monologues, forget Leno and Letterman. Also Raquel Welch looks amazing, especially when dancing in those go-go boots! Thanks for the memories!",1264377600,12,488,4.620689655172414

4310221,5,B004ANS6HC,In watching this DVD it will be realized just how attractive Raquel Welch really is in her mid twenties. Interesting DVd because some of what Bob Hope said was said before the Tet Offensive and before the years long Vietnam War and its conclusion.,1427760000,2,247,4.636363636363637
4310222,5,B004ANS6HC,This was a great show with Bob Hope and all the stars and singers who joined him. Bob Hope was one of a kind as how many entertainers would leave their families every Christmas for years to entertain the troops who were far from their loved ones. It would have been especially hard for the troops and their families being apart at that special time of year.,1425859200,3,357,4.343283582089552
4310223,3,B004ANS6HC,Reminds people like me that were there that only the politicians could have ended the conflict without accomplishing the objectives...if we had objectives. Look at the size of the audience in all the different locations. Hope is the quintessential Hope...fun.,1420588800,,259,5.5
4310224,5,B004ANS6HC,"Bob Hope was the only person to to take his show overseas to the men and women in Vietnam, and other places. God bless this dear man. He has gotten others to take up the slack. What an amazing man!",1419638400,2,197,3.95
4310225,4,B004ANS6HC,"Wonderful memories are brought to mind when viewing this program.  Although the quality isn't what we are accustomed to today, it is still worthy of purchase and viewing.  Bob Hope brought joy and hope to our troops around the world, as they served unselfishly around the world.  Bob brought a little bit of ""home"" to them with his shows.",1416182400,5,338,4.694915254237288

4310229,5,B004ANS6HC,"I recall see Bob Hope when I served in Vietnam in 1967. Even though at the time I was ""short""(close to going home)it was a moving event. With the growing antiwar feeling at home,it was nice to think that this man and his troupe cared to remind us of the good of the USA.Teary eyed when we  got to ""Silent Night"".Will never forget it.",1402531200,7,333,4.203125

seeing this picture of Bob Hope in 1967 is one of the most enjoyable sites of my life. It was better than an out of this work experiences. The good times of bob Hope can not be explain till you see this great man. All Solders should be required to see how this entertainer change many lives",1381968000,4,304,4.169491525423729
4310231,5,B004ANS6HC,"Jerry Colonna was the perfect comic foil for Bob, only wish I could have seen one of those shows. Brilliant!",1354320000,3,108,4.45
4310232,4,B004ANS6HC,"I strongly recommend this program to anybody interested in Bob Hope and the way he influenced our lives.  My sister gave me a copy of this program for Christmas.  This program is a two disc set; the second disc has 12 Bob Hope classic songs.  Several great acts performed throughout this program and I enjoyed them all.  I don't normally rate non educational products, but this was a gift and I enjoyed every minute of the two disc set.",1292630400,10,436,4.481012658227848

8420571,5,B004ANS6HC,"I had just turned 16 when this tour was film back in 1967. Two years later I would be signing up for the draft. Luckily for me I never had to go to Vietnam. This film brings back a lot of memories though, as I watched most every TV special Bod Hope filmed over there. I do feel like these previews leave out a lot of his comedy routines though. Also, the folks serving over there at the time were definitely brave souls and should be proud of what they did. Anyway, we all miss Bob Hope who passed in 2003......RIP - Bob Hope, you are missed.",1515196800,,542,4.074766355140187
8420572,5,B004ANS6HC,"What a great choice for something to watch close to Christmas. It's a spirit-lifter and a reminder of all those who have ""served"" so we can live in freedom. Fun, funny, entertaining - touching. No one has done it better than Bob Hope!",1514073600,,234,4.465116279069767
8420573,5,B004ANS6HC,"This Christmas show presented by Bob Hope and the men and women who went with him to entertain the men and women who bravely served in Viet Nam was a good reminder that even with all the reservations that were held about the US et. al. participation in this disaster of a ""conflict"" that it comes down to the men and women who gave their time and youth and even their lives when asked to do so by people that they did not know.  THIS PROGRAM could never be performed today for anyone.  There would be complaints of ""sexism"" or complaints about how offensive much of this program was towards, women, or gay people or a host of other SJW who would protest some aspect of this program, when in reality, all these performers wanted to do was brighten the day of the brave service people who would not be home for Christmas 1967.  We have replaced bravery and self-sacrifice with the individuals' rights and the self-serving attitudes of people who have never sacrificed anything or anyone.  I am sure this review will not be published, but I really had to just write these thoughts anyway.",1513382400,3,1085,4.520408163265306

8420575,5,B004ANS6HC,"I am thrilled to see this as part of the Amazon Prime streaming video service.  Mr. Hope and many of the entertainers from WW II, Korea and Vietnam truly believed in America and those that served in the military.  His forays into combat theaters over the years are legend among America's military.  The film isn't the best and the humor will seem corny to younger viewers but to those sitting on the ground watching the show it was spot on.  His jokes at Danang (actually the Freedom Hill PX just outside the city) were crafted to his audience, US Marines.  The jokes and quips at each location were similarly tailored to the audience.  Today's Hollywood crowd should be made to watch this video and look at the faces of the young men.  That is real entertainment that lifted the spirit if for just one day of soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen.  Those who perform for the USO continue Mr. Hope's legacy of service.  Thanks Mr. Hope and I enjoyed the show mid-mountain at Freedom Hill.  My squad and I humped over from the 1stMarDiv area to see you and it was worth the walk.",1513296000,,1078,4.510309278350515
8420576,5,B004ANS6HC,This was a golden age of comedy where funny wasn't riddled with vulgarity.  I was a teen during the VietNam era and remember looking forward to Bob Hope's Christmas special recorded from the front lines annually.  I can't even imagine how much it meant to those serving in such life threatening areas.  I am grateful on behalf of all those who served for the sacrifices they made and the dedication of the entertainers who made it a little brighter for them for just a few hours.,1509840000,,479,4.546511627906977

8420578,5,B004ANS6HC,"I saw this Bob Hope ""Christmas"" special when he (and others...like Raquel Welch) traveled thru South Vietnam in 1967 entertaining the troops. I saw his show when he brought it to the Central Highlands/Pleiku region...to Camp Enari (where the 4th Infantry, 2nd Armored Division/my unit... and 1st Air Cavalry were based).  NOTE: He finished his ""Christmas"" tour and departed...just before the TET OFFENSIVE happened in late January. In spite of all the problems that plagued America's involvement in the Vietnam War...Bob Hope continued to visit us in the military... no matter where we were. He did this America's military during WW II, the Korean War & in Vietnam. When I saw his show (along with the HOT Raquel Welch) in Dec. 1967...just a month before the Tet Offensive began. Along with my memories of my extended tour with the 2nd Armored Division in Nam...I will also always have wonderful memories of Bob Hope's Christmas show. This video is a great remembrance for anyone who cares about Bob Hope (and the things he did for America's military)!  Cpt. Van Russell  (Austin/Bee Cave, TX)",1498780800,,1093,4.9945054945054945
