4011520,4,B002Y5FKRW,"This couldn't have come at a better time.

The story of Ruth is a prophetic picture of the body of believers (Orpah and Rut) and their relationship with Israel (Naomi). In these troubled times, many believer's in Messiah Yeshua are tempted to desert Israel, but some will show integrity to the very end and HaShem will reward them.

The film, as all do, has a bit of embellishment, but the storyline is not spoiled. It is a fine portrayal that for the most part is reflective of the scroll. By far the best production I've seen regarding this ""book.""

The principles of redemption as given in Torah could have been interpreted and played out better, as well as some of the contextual issues, such as gathering minyans of leaders at the city gates.

There were legitimate concerns for the next of kin redeemer, and they did not involve racism, as depicted. That is not to say that it is an impossibility that racism could have been involved. This is one of the areas where artistic interpretation/license came into play.",1276819200,,1019,4.675977653631285
4011521,5,B002Y5FKRW,"I really like this movie. I enjoyed it even more when I saw it the second time today on TBN. Naomi's and Ruth acting were superior. They were very believable. The movie is very close to the bible account. It's funny to see Carmen acting as Boaz. I thought he fit pretty well for this role. I'm so glad they made a good movie about Ruth, (not like the old version - I think it's called The Story of Ruth,I didn't even watch that one to the end. It was very theatrical and made up a lot.)Some criticized that the hair look was not all accurate, well yes, but it did not distract from the story. And most actors did a good job. And it's also a blessing to watch a movie where the actors pray and (some of them at least) are true believers. I can't wait until we own it ourselves.",1273363200,3,776,4.078431372549019
4011522,3,B002Y5FKRW,"Although this film is a bit slow, it is the most accurate of the films on Ruth that I have found.  It follows the biblical story pretty closely with some additions where the biblical story is silent.  For instance, the film shows how the two husbands die.  The Book of Ruth never gives us the details of how they die.  My one criticism of the film is that to get rid of the subtitles, you have to go to the Bonus Feature section and turn off the subtitles.  The default should be without subtitles, but it isn't.",1272153600,8,512,4.237113402061856

4011524,2,B002Y5FKRW,"This movie is probably more Biblically based than the older Hollywood version but feels rather trite and even somewhat tired in places. I received more inspiration from the older Hollywood version even though it was not exactly as the Bible describes it. also i am not really sure Carman should be doing acting, he tends to overplay some areas and be rather wooden at other times. Maybe he should stick to his wonderful singing and songwriting.",1268006400,9,444,4.855263157894737
4011525,5,B002Y5FKRW,There are several movies made around the story of Ruth in the Bible.  This one is the most accurate and is well put together for the limited budget it was created from.  You will thoroughly enjoy this movie!,1265328000,49,207,4.421052631578948
4011526,4,B002Y5FKRW,"The movie ""Book of Ruth"" is very good overall....and mostly follows the Biblical story line, though it's a B-rated type film (you know...acting is good by some, not all people involved, money is tight for the budget, etc...).  We originally had added Book of Ruth to our Biblical collection, because it's close to the Biblical account and doesn't put so many inaccuracies into your head.

HOWEVER, the ""Story of Ruth"" film also sold is something we tried from library before deciding to buy and WOULDN'T BUY IT.  Oy!  It's purely made up, full of errors according to the Biblical book of Ruth.  So buy this film here, NOT the other one!

HAVING SAID THIS...here's an update we came to decision on a while back:
The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting."" We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people. You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible. As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth. So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film. There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others). We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE). Thanks for ""listening."" :)",1264723200,111,2061,4.891117478510028
4011527,5,B002Y5FKRW,"It is not to often that you find a movie based on a bible character to be quality and extremely well written, for The Book of Ruth it excels on both accounts.  The story of Ruth will capture your heart like never before with a superb performance by Sherry Morris.  It was great to see her character interact with Boaz played by Carman and share some amazing chemistry on screen.  If you are a fan of the biblically account of Ruth or if you enjoy a classic story of romance and redemption, The Book Of Ruth won't disappoint.

4011570,3,B002Y5FKRW,"Wasn't aware this movie existed till I saw it on Amazon. Tried to buy it, but the seller wasn't up to date on their inventory, so I was refunded. Finally got to watch it on Pureflix. I felt a pang of disappointment as soon as Naomi's face came into view. There wasn't a gray hair in sight, and layered bangs stuck out from the sheet wrapped around her head and shoulders. Eyeliner and lip gloss were visible. I was glad the characters were allowed to wear sandals, when so many Christian movies have them barefooted. But the women, Naomi, Ruth, and Orpah, were wearing flip flops! The women's clothing and hairstyles weren't imaginative. The young women wore what resembled a do-rag, with a head band that tied in back, the ends trailing down, and hair hanging loose, framing the face. All the characters wore the same tunic pattern that can be found online, and looked to be newly sewn from crisp sheets. Ruth appeared to be the same age as her mother-in-law, and in certain lighting, older. Orpah's mother obviously had a face lift and, being prettier, should've played as Orpah. When Ruth's husband dies of an apparent heart attack, the women are standing by three small piles of rocks representing the men's graves. But the ground is level; there's no indication that a recent grave was dug. When the decision is made to return home, I guess Naomi was broke, cos the producers have them walking. The bible says the townsfolk talked amongst themselves, asking if that's Naomi; the hardship of the past 10 years must've shown on her face. The movie has only one woman recognize Naomi, and runs to greet her. When Ruth goes to the fields and Boaz appears, I actually chuckled at Carman's entrance. He comes over a rise, hands on hips, pauses, strides to an employee, puts hand on hips again, surveys his domain (he has nice legs). Doesn't make a good boss, tho, cos he fires a guy who can't answer the question of ""who is that woman."" The guy turns out to be related to Boaz' nearest kinsmen redeemer; this is the producers way of adding some spice towards the end, so Boaz won't have it so easy to clear the way for marriage. If they'd just stick to the Book...anyways, Dan Haggerty has a small part, in which he's smitten with the one neighbor who greeted Naomi. Modern dating traditions were inserted here, and at the harvest celebration, concerning attractions to the opposite sex. From the little I know about ancient Israeli traditions, men didn't speak to women at the well, much less carry the water pot for them. And speaking of modern traditions, except for the part when Naomi gets mad at God and changed her name, she speaks like a present day Christian with full knowledge of all the scriptures, not available in that time frame (around 1300 B.C.). At the harvest, Ruth really did sleep at Boaz' feet, but in the bible, when he told her to go back to sleep, she slept at his feet again; they didn't cuddle together. It's still a wholesome movie the family can watch together. It's told in flashback by Obed, to a young shepherd boy, David. But it's also not possible that Obed was alive when David was a teenager, since the bible mentions that Jesse was an old man when Saul was king. Jesse remarried after his wife died, and his 2nd wife had David, the baby of the family. Carmen and Dan are good actors; the others were okay, the kinsman needed improving. In closing, I'm glad circumstances prevented me the purchase of this movie, and I await the day when Christian movies stand up to those produced in Hollywood.  Ruth is a great, uplifting, romantic, story; putting it on film becomes a challenge as it comes dangerously close to boring. It's too tempting to add things. I think Carman was the perfect Boaz, but the perfect movie of Ruth has yet to be filmed.",1459900800,,3778,4.588757396449704

4011588,5,B002Y5FKRW,"Having seen this movie on a large Television 36"" inch it was quite entertaining.  Let me say first that if you have not read the book of Esther in the Bible, yes the word of GOD. then read that first.  Yes the plot is centered around Ruth and her mother Naomi which she treated like a saint.  Yes, it is a little odd with the actors wearing makeup.  But pay attention to the fact that Ruth left Moab (like leaving USA) to live in Israel (like IRAQ today-stretching a little) and decided that Naomi was her real kin-relative.  Do not watch with the lights on and turn the words on the screen if you are ok with that.  Ruth was ridiculed, mocked, and nearly spit on for being a non-Jew but that is a precursor to being a Christian today-that is if your light ""so shines before men, that they may see your good works AND glorify your Father which is in heaven"".  I like massage my wife's (one) feet during the movie so at the least she gets a good foot massage or neck massage.  If you are not enjoying this review then please go back to reading the book of Ruth. This video does have you read the actual book.  A better movie on another woman of god is ""ONE night with the King"" with Esther being portayed",1442448000,,1203,4.195652173913044

Aside from the terrible acting and production (the women are wearing thick eyeliner and lip gloss for crying out loud!!) it barely follows the actual story of Ruth from the Bible. I was so embarrassed to show this movie to my small group at church. Here are some of the more major errors:

-Ruth's mother is portrayed as very mean-spirited.
-Naomi has a friend that she later sets up with a man named Simeon
-The closer kinsman is named Neb and is also mean-spirited, and out to get Boaz
-When Ruth lays at Boaz's feet, she covers her feet with his robe, instead of just uncovering his feet (one of the more important details)
-When Boaz wakes to discover her, he is shocked that she ""chose him"". He also tells her how much he wants to ""be with her"" but he can't yet. He then holds her the rest of the night.
-Instead of just going to the other kinsman, the movie has Boaz pretend to be crazy in his love for Ruth to trick ""Neb""

This made-for-television film first aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network in 2010. The acting is so-so at best although Sherry Morris does a decent job as Ruth. It's obvious from the sets, costumes, and filming that the producer was constrained by a shoestring budget. There are small parts for Rebecca Holden (Knight Rider regular), Lana Wood (Natalie Wood's sister), and Dan ""Grizzly Adams"" Haggerty. Christian singer, Carman, is stiff as a board as Boaz. The film is somewhat faithful to the biblical account but the stilted acting and the cheesy sets and costumes are distractions.",1414972800,,708,4.949579831932773

The biblical book of Ruth tells a beautiful, emotional story about God's faithfulness to, and amazing provision for, those who belong to Him, and how He works out His will regardless of circumstances.  This movie fully robbed me of the preciousness of the story.  I can't recommend a different version because this is the only one I've seen, but this movie set the bar so low that anything has to be better.  What a shame.

I thought this was part of the The Bible Collection series by TNT - a huge mistake on my part.  For the life of me couldn't figure out how the quality was so poor compared to TNT's ""Joseph"", a movie I own and have watched a dozen or so times.  Now I know.

The next bible story movie I add to my cart will definitely be from the TNT series, and I'll check the IMDB.com ratings and reviews first.  I should have done that before purchasing The Book of Ruth.  I won't be making that mistake again.

4011679,3,B002Y5FKRW,"This movie sorely lacked authenticity.  The make-up and hair styles (Naiomi had bangs) were modern day.  Especially with Ruth's real mother, she looked like she stepped out of one of those ""Housewives of (wherever)"" reality shows. You could even see clear, shiny nail polish on Naiomi at one point.  The only acting I appreciated was that of the actresses that played Ruth and Naomi.  Their tender and obedient spirits did come through. However, everyone looked too Anglo-Saxon.  No ethnic influence whatsoever - no accents, the clothes were too clean, and modern-looking materials were used. Teeth too white, some men too clean-shaven.  The whole show reminded me of an adult drama club slapping a show together.  It's a real shame because it really does appear to be Biblically accurate, which is why I gave it three stars.  If you're going to make the effort to make a Bible movie, shouldn't you pay more attention to making it authentic, therefore making it more believable?

As many Biblical stories are enhanced when put into a visual form (from book to film), there are some liberties taken as to how the sons died (which the Bible does not say).

4011713,2,B002Y5FKRW,This is one of the most beautiful stories in the bible but this DVD does not do it justice.  Naomi had two grown sons and so was not a young woman.  The actress who played Ruth's mother in law was obviously not of Jewish descent and colored her hair to look younger.  Who did that during that era?  That is just one example of how this film did not portray the reality of that time.  Another are the clothes that the actors wore...pretty lame.

4011715,1,B002Y5FKRW,"Ruth is one of my favorite love stories in the Bible so when a friend loaned me the movie and I saw the cover I was a bit skeptical. Ruth looked too old and Carman didn't strike me as having the acting chops for a role as dynamic as Boaz but I determined to give it a chance. The movie starts VERY slowly and barely picks up any speed as it goes along. I won't belabor the point other reviewers made about the clothes, make-up, and background settings other than to say that it was truly awful. Eyeliner shouldn't be visible on biblical characters particularly on men who are supposed to be poor laborers.

But what drove me literally to the point of screaming at times was the complete butchering of such a beautiful story filled with such richness and drama. The movie tries to weave in unnecessary subplots like the wicked Neb and Naomi's spinster friend that detract from the subplots that are already built into the story. The wonderful back story of Boaz being the son of Rahab is reduced to one throw-away line by Neb. The beautiful symbolism of Ruth asking Boaz to cover her with his cloak is entirely missed when she crawls up under it herself while he's sleeping. The real, human emotion experienced by Naomi as she goes through intense depression, bitterness, and despair is completely drowned in the syrupy sweetness of a Naomi who drags every line out twice as long as it needs to be in a futile attempt to make it sound more profound. Some of the most beautiful dialogue that could have been lifted straight from the Bible is either totally left out or watered down into pitiful obscurity and Carman turns the noble and generous kinsman-redeemer into a drunken, fighting, conniver!

If you don't know and love this story you might enjoy this movie. If you do know and love this beautiful and touching love story you will never be satisfied with this inept adaptation. In this case, as in so many others, the book really is better!",1382054400,2,1944,4.567335243553009

The downfall is the wardrobe, makeup and acting. Some of the acting is good from Carmen, Dan Haggerty and Lana Wood. But the woeful portrayal of Neb by producer Ray Nikolaison is distractingly bad, taking what could be a decent low-budget bible movie and reducing it to ""high school play"" level. The wardrobe is bleak, with fabrics and colors not even suggestive of B.C. era clothing.

Ruth is married to an Israeli named Malon. He dies of some heart ailment as in the movie he's grabbing his chest, tired and looks weak. So if you've read the book of Ruth before then its known Naomi loses not only this son but also her husband and other son. Naomi decides its time to go back to her homeland and at first her daughters are walking with her but she sends them back to Moab. Ruth does not go back and tells Naomi that her people will be my people, where you go I will go, where you die I will die and your God will be my God. So the two women travel across the barren lands for days with there clothes on there backs, a thing water and whatever food that could fit in a basket that Naomi carried.

In that respect alone, it probably works well. For entertainment value, there is little. It starts out slow and then gets dull before venturing into unrepentant boredom. The dialogue ranges from Sunday School to atrocious hack-work. At times it gets so heavy-handed as to induce eye-rolling, if not groaning from the viewer. The acting compliments the bad dialogue nicely by being of the high-school play variety. It was obviously filmed somewhere in the United States and looks nothing like Israel. In fact, it looks like somebody's farm in Virginia or North Carolina. Comically, the actresses all sport modern makeup, manicures, and just-out-of-the-salon hairstyles. Everybody in the movie, whether Jew or pagan, rich or poor, seems to shop at the same fashion store---""Bed Sheets-R-Us,"" and apparently, they had excellent dry cleaners in Ancient Israel, because nobody ever gets wrinkled or dirty.",1367884800,4,1121,5.411428571428571

4011785,2,B002Y5FKRW,"When I recently suggested to the Adult Education class that I teach at church that we begin a study of the book of Ruth, a classmate suggested I watch this movie, to see if it could be used as part of our class study.

If read with an understanding of the context within which it was written and meant to be understood, Ruth is a fascinating book that speaks just as much to our current times. To most people who know anything about the book - and to the creators of this film - Ruth is a love story, one which has given us a few verses that are often included (quite out of context) in marriage ceremonies. The book of Ruth is about love, but it is also about so very much more - and when it is about love, it is not just the romantic kind of love that many people want to think of when considering Boaz and Ruth.

And that's where this movie starts to have problems. In focusing the telling of the story in too narrow a band of what the actual biblical story is all about, it becomes something not at all true to the scriptural account. It's often necessary to recast ancient biblical stories in a contemporary light in order to be understood properly by today's culture, but when doing so, you have to start with a correct set of original concepts to translate into modern understanding. This film didn't really succeed in doing that, in my opinion. In most of the scenes, both the characters and the script looked and sounded like discussions among upper middle-class white Americans, with little real connection to the real drama of the actual story of Ruth than the fact that the women wore headscarves. The production would have benefited greatly from a more realistic portrayal of the characters, especially including a more scripturally accurate portrayal of their actual lifestyle, religious beliefs, and cultural concerns. All of this could have been done in a way that was understandable and accessible to a general audience, and - I believe - would have made for a far more engrossing and dramatic story. I understand a desire to keep the film completely family-friendly, but even the ""uncovering of the feet"" scene could have been portrayed in a way more consistent with the way that most sound biblical scholarship interprets it, while remaining solidly within a PG-13 rating.

To Christians, the story of Ruth and her ""redemption"" by Boaz is understood as a precursor to the spiritual redemption ultimately achieved through Jesus Christ. As a Christian, I accept that understanding of the story, but I also recognize that it is a powerful story even without that layer of understanding, within its strictly Jewish context and understanding. Part of that context requires an understanding of the ""kinsman redeemer"" concept as practiced in ancient Judaism - a concept referred to in the movie, but hardly explained at all. It certainly wasn't explained anywhere nearly well enough for a viewer to truly understand its significance in the story. And not understanding that concept leads to the absolute worst scene in this movie: the truly unfortunate, and completely unscriptural, accounting of the ""court scene"" with the elders, in which Boaz ends up with Ruth. This scene is so wrong that it's really not worth offering specific individual criticisms. Suffice it to say that if the film's creators had actually understood the scriptural account of this scene - which is the absolute dramatic and personal high point of the entire book - they would have stuck much more closely to the scriptures. The actual account is full of intrigue, excitement, tension, irony, and surprise. By trying to ""simplify"" the scene - largely because within the film, they hadn't sufficiently explained the religious/legal stipulations that were being debated, and because they wanted to make this story fit more into a modern American Hollywood love story - they simply blew it. Instead of what could have been a great scene for the viewer, the scene becomes boring and flat, made even worse by the fact that it may contain some of the worst acting and set design in the entire movie.

In the end, there isn't anything particularly hideous about this movie. It tells a rather common modern Western love story, told in an unconvincing historical setting. There have been many of those, and there will be many more. On that score, the film is relatively benign. What is particularly frustrating to me, though, as a pastor, is the missed opportunity that the movie represents. If properly understood and portrayed, the book of Ruth could be the basis for a great, interesting movie. My other concern is that people will watch this superficial and often inaccurate treatment of the book and think that they know what this book of the Bible is really all about - what it said to its original audience, and what its message is for us today. Unfortunately, I think this movie simply fails in that regard.",1326585600,3,4893,4.800711743772242
4011786,3,B002Y5FKRW,"This story moves very slowly. The climax of it involves Boaz 'redeeming' a land parcel which involves marrying Ruth (& taking care of her & Naomi), and it takes place in front of a ""temple"" building.  The Biblical scene was actually played out at the ""city gate""; there was no temple until Solomon built it 4 generations later. The only place of worship was the tent of the tabernacle.. which was probably still at the town of Shilo... not at Bethlehem or Jerusalem.",1326240000,3,466,4.614457831325301
4011787,4,B002Y5FKRW,"The Biblical book of Ruth is dramatized with excellent accuracy to the scripture. A mix of both novice and acclaimed cast proves adequate, though not stellar. Perhaps it is due to the dialogue writing that they seem somewhat stilted, lacking in emotion. Most dialogue omits the contemporary use of contractions, where they were used it sounded better to me. Neither was there an attempt to give it a Biblical intonation. Regardless, the scenes were beautiful, sets believable, costuming well done, and over all a very good scripture rendition of the events of Naomi and Ruth.

Let's face it; the book of Ruth is not exactly romantic, not adventurous, not intriguing, not suspenseful, but history of major importance for the linage of David being from Bethlehem, and thus the prophesy of a Christ Child born of the House of David in a Bethlehem stable. But the 85 verses of Ruth were compacted well into just 91 minutes. I enjoyed Sherry Morris as Ruth, and Dan Haggerty (Grizzly Adams) as Simeon.

This is obviously a film made for the followers of the Christian faith, not a twist of content to make it more romantic or to include some sinister political plot. That's why I liked it, a very good job for the intended audience, on a budget that makes it affordable. It follows Naomi and Ruth from the famine in Moab, their trek back to Israel, through the Boaz field gleaning, Naomi's push to get Ruth married, and of course then the union that produced a son, Obed, grandfather to David. The film opens and ends with David and his granddad talking, Obed telling his grandson the story of the women, of faith, of the `loving-kindness' found in story (& scriptures), of Gods provision for King David's ancestress, of the integrity shown by Boaz, the benevolence expressed so often in these scriptures, and of course just the linage prophecy. It speaks of faithfulness, ""wither thou goest, I will go"". The film visualizes scriptures like: `uncover his feet, and lay thee down', and `a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor', but in the film the sandal became a missile launched by an angry Neb toward Boaz.

So dialogue could have been better, and the film did offer subtitles but they were unfortunately not quite in sync with the scene changes. It was yet enjoyable, and quite the companion DVD if you or a group is going to read or study the book of Ruth. Excellent DVD for a church library.",1325980800,8,2408,4.701421800947867

While it does not track 100% with the biblical story it is a much better, truer to spirit rendering of the story. It does throw you a bit to see the make up, hear the mid-western accents & recognize some of the scenery but after a few minutes the effective acting will draw you right into the story. It's really well done overall and I'll certainly buy more of this series. Nice to have a dvd that kids can watch without worry although it's likely more interesting to teen & up. There are even a couple of well known faces acting in this movie but all of the performances were believable and interesting. A few plot 'twists' are thrown in that aren't in the biblical story but the overall effect of the movie makes this one well worth watching.",1319673600,4,872,4.355828220858895

4011791,4,B002Y5FKRW,"I stumbled upon this movie as I was up late one night.  I started watching it and was so intrigued I couldn't stop.  The Book of Ruth follows the Biblical Book of Ruth with a couple of add=ons to make the story flow better, but overall it is an entertaining and well done movie.

People who've read Ruth from the Bible (and if you haven't you should) will recognize the story throughout the movie.  Naomi loses her husband and sons while living in Moab and is accompanied by her daughter-in-law, Ruth, when she returns to Bethlehem.  Ruth is an example of steadfastness, loyalty, and honoring of one's parents, as commanded by the Bible.  Ruth is ultimately married to Boaz, the owner of th field she had been gleaning from, and the story ends.

Even though it is a simple concept, the film does have merit.  Its message is one of hope and the viewer feels good after watching it.  There are no strong theological discussions other than what the Bible story has to offer.  This is a good family-oriented movie that many will enjoy.

It's not the lesson of a drunken, wealthy party-goer who sees a foreign woman and decides she's his next love interest.  The entire story is a living example of how the ""repurchaser"" (Messiah - Jesus Christ) played by the real-life individual Boaz, would put away selfish interests and buy back the world of mankind from its hopeless situation that Adam had placed mankind in.  The allegedly religious ""technical advisor"" must have been absent throughout the scripting and filming of this poorly done excuse for cinematography.

That is part of the story of Ruth, a Moabite who chose to follow her Jewish mother-in-law to the land of Israel after tragedy struck their family.  The Book of Ruth: Journey of Faith is a cinematic adaptation of the biblical narrative of the book of Ruth.

Directed by Stephen Patrick Walker and written by Walker, Salvatore DiSalvatore, and Richard Raucci, this engaging film stars Sherry Morris as Ruth, Eleese Lester (Lone Star) as Naomi, and Carmen (The Champion) as Boaz. The supporting cast includes, Kera O'Bryon (The Bill Collector), Lana Wood (Diamonds Are Forever),  DJ Perry (Wicked Spring), Rebecca Holden (Knight Rider) and Dan Haggerty (Grizzly Adams).  Morris' and Lester's winning portrayals of their respective characters, delivered an authenticity to their on-screen familial relationship. Lester gracefully plays a grief-stricken mother strongly rooted in her faith. Ruth's tender loyalty to her mother-in-law is adeptly expressed through Morris' performance. Natalie Wood's younger sister, Lana Wood, brought some spunk to the film as Naomi's friend and DJ Perry proved that acting involves more than mere words.

Traditionally, the story of Ruth is primarily seen as a love story between a man and a woman. However, it was pleasing to see that this film wonderfully highlighted the significance of Ruth and Naomi's relationship. Through its splendid cinematography, it focused on their mutual suffering and physical journey together to the land of Israel as a visual metaphor for commitment to faith and relationships, especially when traversing difficulties.

Ruth's faithfulness to her mother-in-law also speaks to the biblical mandate to care for widows. It is after Ruth demonstrates her loyalty to Naomi, that she is blessed through Ruth with Boaz, as her husband. When we are faithful to God's people, God is faithful to us.",1285632000,,1967,5.37012987012987
4011818,1,B002Y5FKRW,"The production quality of this movie is shockingly bad and so is the acting.  The acting is so terrible that it distracts you from the story.  It's really really low budget.  If you compare the production of the movie Jeremiah, Esther or Joseph for example which were excellent bible movies this is embarrasingly bad.  It's such a pity because the bible book of Ruth is a beautiful account.

4011819,2,B002Y5FKRW,"The only way I can understand the 4-star average review this movie had at the time I received it as a gift is by believing friends and family members of the actors left the reviews.

When one of the comments said it was low production quality I thought they meant like the other bible series movies are (because in comparison to Hollywood, they are lower and more cheesy), but this was VERY low production quality (sound levels going up and down, extended musical interludes that felt like they were there because no one could come up with dialogue etc), the acting in general was amateurish and stiff, and the casting and make-up in some cases was way off (Ruth's birth mother looked like she'd had botox in her lips and had on a full face of 21 century make-up, another actress had what sounded like a New York accent).

Again, I say all this not to make you NOT see this, but rather to go in with your expectations set. I went in expecting a LOT more and so was disappointed. I will likely watch it again now knowing what to expect and will probably enjoy it more.

Several reviewers said this was the most accurate movie of the story of Ruth, I agree that's probably true, but that's not really saying much given the other options.  Frankly, although I almost always prefer a movie to a book, next time I'll read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unshaken-Ruth-The-Lineage-of-Grace-Series-3/dp/0842335978/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unshaken: Ruth (The Lineage of Grace Series #3)</a>&nbsp;- perhaps one day someone will make THAT into a movie :)",1282867200,28,1590,5.034220532319392
4011820,4,B002Y5FKRW,"It's important to me that movies based on the Bible be biblically accurate, or else there's no point to them. In that area, this movie succeeds. What it adds for drama doesn't contradict what's written in the Bible. I also like they they're speaking modern English. One reviewer said they should us
e 'thee' and 'thou,' but that's stupid. If they were trying to use the correct language, it would be Hebrew or Aramaic, not an earlier version of English.
The only problem I have with it is a problem I have with most movies based off the Bible - it's a bit boring or slow-moving.
That said, I'm still glad I purchased it.
I'm very pleased that some people are making Christian movies, and wish to encourage it!",1280707200,3,709,4.503875968992248
4011821,2,B002Y5FKRW,"I really wanted to like this movie. I knew it was a lower budget productiuon and I also understand that the short book of Ruth isn't much material to make a full length movie. And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.

However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.

With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed.",1280188800,14,763,4.219178082191781
8384044,3,B002Y5FKRW,"I appreciate what they tried to do with this movie, but...

My biggest gripe would be the liberty they took with the story.  I understand that you have to fill in things, but it seemed more like they made stuff up.  For instance, the uncle - in the movie, they made it seem like the uncle ""Near Relative"" was actively trying to ruin Boaz, and that he hated Ruth.  I also feel that they spent to much time in the Moab scene.  On top of that, the acting was very rough.",1525910400,,467,4.087912087912088

8384050,1,B002Y5FKRW,"How do you take such an incredible story and turn it into a movie that is so badly done? Well, in this particular version they did. Just watched it and can't believe they produced this. The story takes place in Israel and Moab a very, very long time ago. Their clothes looked like they just bought them at Walmart. After walking from Moab to Israel, Ruth and Naomi looked better than when I go work out at the gym. Didn't anyone on this production think about these things? They embellished the story needlessly. One point that was very odd was in the quote that is so famous by Ruth. The cut the last part of it out. What could possibly be the motivation for cutting out one of the most significant lines in the story?

At one point the unknown kinsman-redeemer (who was known in the movie) seemed to have a blue mustache. His beard also looked a bit blue. They totally goofed up that part of the story as well.

But one of the most bothersome points I found about this movie is that they tried to Christianize it. One quote from Naomi sounded like something the apostle Paul would say.

The only positive thing I found was the addition of having David at the beginning and the end. I did think they captured the idea that the book was written to show where David had come from.

My recommendation is to read the book. The movie is an utter failure.",1515369600,,1350,4.345238095238095

8384052,4,B002Y5FKRW,"It was a good film if watched with the New Testament teachings of Christ in mind to guard your mind against the message given off about unequal status and treatment of women and the errors of such thinking as this and on other issues, that you often find in observing ancient society and sometimes even now. It gave a good look of the hardships of life in those times, as well as in life in general even now that minorities, the poor, elders and the weak face daily and therefore it could be used as a good teaching tool on these subjects and about keeping the whole truth of Christ in mind that delivers us from darkness, so that we can be fruitful in our studies, observations and understanding, so that our path is clear and so that misunderstandings and condemnation can be avoided. It could be used as a testament to the love of God for us that Jesus came to declare. An example of why we should be grateful to and abide faithful to the Lord. By love we are blessed and set free and truth and righteousness are love. It shows how we can take refuge in the shadow of the wings of God and in nothing less. Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
