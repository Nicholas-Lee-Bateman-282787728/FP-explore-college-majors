3772138,2,B001R10BC8,"First off , I like sci- fi and I like anime , so I figured this should be a good choice . Hey the trailer looked great. Well, Moonlight Mile it's not so good . The main characters are Gorou who seems like he'd be more at home on an MTV reality show and Lostman an emotionless self centered drone who's as interesting as a dog turd.
 The 2 guys are friends and trying to get into space , each following a different path to achieve that goal . The show is just lousy. Here's what you get for your money , Gorou gets drunk a lot then strips down and does the windmill( I won't elaborate , leave it to your imagination) , Lostman gives a cold wooden performance ( they should have given him an Austrian accent , then you could say 'Hey! Maybe this guy is actually a Terminator.' to keep some interest on the character) , and they get laid (a lot ) .
I've got nothing against sex scenes , but c'mon , I just want to tell the producers ' Hey! I get it already , they have lots of sex ! Now get back to the story! ' . My hopes of the story progressing were answered by more sex and Gorou drunkenly windmilling his junk to anyone who wants a look. And the women ! Oh man! if you're gonna force em on us , then draw them to look like women , these were some of the most burly man-ish looking ladies I've seen. I mean cmon , Ru Pauls Drag Race has less manish looking chicks ,and they're dudes.
 I did actually like the sci fi stuff , what little there was of it and when the story finally started progressing ,the season ended. So there you have it . If you want to give it a try , then go for it . Oh and if you do , I wish you luck trying to find season 2. I know it was made but I can't find it anywhere.",1302998400,3,1698,3.8485714285714288
3772139,4,B001R10BC8,"Loved the anime, think ""planetes"" when you go to purchase this but as a precurser to the state of space development in the anime planetes.",1296259200,,138,4.56
3772140,4,B001R10BC8,"Are you done watching bubblegum neon-tint high school kids superhero their way beyond the impossible?  Are you weary of huger than huge breasted moe teenage girls magicking their way through life's problems?  Are you tired of fifteen year old samurai supermen drowning their doubts about their sexual orientation in lakes of blood?  Are you just tired of Japan's self-emasculation and fascination of women-men?  Then step right up.

After reading past reviews of this, and analyzing them, I knew that I was in for a good story, and I wasn't disappointed.  Sometimes, you don't need some bashing over the head about the agonizing of a bishie seventeen year old who can pilot a supertech giant robot plane like he was born to it but can't decide whether to get it on with the hot superglam pop star or the 14 going on 12 underclassgirl nascent savior of the galaxy.  You know which story I'm talking about.  And I'm not even scratching the surface of the really embarrassing stuff out there.

This story is about two dudes who go for it.  They drink and screw their way through life, but hey, whatever: Who's really going to take serious advice on morality from otakus?  There's some good old sinister gummint plotting, some storytelling about what a new energy source would mean for global politics and interstate maneovering, and there is plenty of room to grow.  It's not too complicated, but you know, I get plenty of complication in my day job.  This hits the spot.

I found especially refreshing Lostman's sum-up of the differences between an highly self-determined western, probably atheist or don't care either way F-22 pilot and a (probably) Yemeni camel-riding bedouin Muslim who defers to Allah on everything: ""I'm trying to do my best for international goodwill, but I think we just see the world differently.""  After (in so many oher stories) repeatedly being clubbed over the head about how we all oughta get along all the time, and once again being told that the enemy is not the enemy, it's some sleazy scumbag in the GOVERNMENT (gasp!  shock!  once again?!), it's nice to see something other than straight worshipful cultural relativism at work.

I have no complaints about the animation.  When I started watching animation, subtitles were technologically unfeasible and the degradation from fandubbing was so bad that it would be considered unwatchable today.  The animation is serviceable.  Everything doesn't have to be one way.  Huge difference between say, the now nearly unwatchable Macross and a CGI tour de force like Vexille or Appleseed Ex Machina (both incredible on BluRay).

I don't have a huge animation collection.  I have picked out my titles carefully.  The stories I do like tend to be relatively straightforward and subdued compared to the mainstream of Japanese animation.  I am talking about stories like Area 88, Planetes, Yomigaeru Sora Rescue Wings, Toshokan Wars, The Girl Who Leaped Through Time, Freedom, Honneamise no Tsuba, Katsuhiro Ohtomo's Memories, Grave of the Fireflies (if I can bring myself to watch it again), and then trending toward the edges of what I am talking about not liking in the first paragraph: Ai Oboete Imasu Ka, Macross Zero, and lastly, Macross Frontier as the outer edge of watchable just on the basis of subject matter and treatment.

Purchase with confidence.  I do suggest you watch it in Japanese with the subtitles.  I give it four stars because I'm stingy and I don't fall over gushing easily.",1260921600,3,3469,4.963604852686308
3772141,3,B001R10BC8,"This first season of Moonlight Mile is a relatively realistic look into the future development of alternative international space programs, as experienced through two main characters/friends who share an ambition to reach the moon.  Conveniently, these friends tread largely independent paths, thus allowing insight into multiple space organizations.

Both friends are keen of mind and also keen on sexual conquest.  The former provides many entertaining moments whether it be American ace pilot Lostman deftly aiming a space shuttle or his friend--the Japanese construction specialist extraordinaire Goro--intuiting the best route for saving a trapped construction worker.  The ""conquest"" issue, however, drags down both the characters and the maturity quotient.  The issue certainly isn't that they are sexually active as such, but the tangential explicit inclusion of most of these sex scenes comes off as crass.  Almost like self-sabotaging an otherwise mature work to appeal to those who don't quite get what ""mature"" entails.

This also leads to issues with the translation.  The English voice acting is superb here but the script itself sadly adds an extra layer of immaturity that actually isn't present in the subtitles.  One scene really made this difference stand out in particular.  In the English dub, Lostman speaks to his latest temp girlfriend like a cheap trick, foul language placed where none was before.  In the subtitles, the script and va intonation comes off much more respectful, and no foul language.

Overall, the series was well-produced if uneven in episode quality.  The show could have benefited from more Lostman-focused episodes.  A too-slowly paced three episode arc focusing on Goro on disc two was almost unwelcome (and could have easily been contained within two episodes at the very most), especially when contrasted against the excellent Lostman-dominated last episode.

The show is well-drawn and animated, albeit with some awkward cg in the early episodes.  Later episodes featuring mech walkers and even more fantastic machinery in the final episode look significantly improved.  I hope to see a localized second season of the anime, but it doesn't seem to be happening at this point.

Despite the flaws, there are enough highlights in this series for it to be mildly recommended to mature anime fans who will enjoy the overall smart and serious nature of the show while merely scoffing at the occasional lapses into immaturity rather than be offended by them.",1252627200,17,2501,5.369230769230769
3772142,1,B001R10BC8,"Planetes is the obvious comparison, but *contrast* is the more apt terminology. Moonlight Mile has one-dimensional characters, gratuitous sex, a contrived plot, okay animation, etc. Some might think that some of the space related animation looks better than Planetes, but it is obviously computer generated, which once again contrasts with Planetes.

Planetes has so many things: hard science and a believable future, comedy *and* tragedy, interesting characters and character development, the growing gap between 3rd and 1st world countries, conspiracies, the dangers of space, staying true to one's convictions', a love story, and it even captures that ""Golden Age of Space Exploration"" feeling. There's something in Planetes for just about everyone.

In contrast, Moonlight Mile's plot feels contrived and the main characters are a couple of jocks that seem more interested in one night stands than anything else. Planetes is still the best hard science space Anime and still one of the best (and underrated) Anime of all time. Moonlight Mile doesn't even come close to touching it. Skip this series and get Planetes instead.",1246924800,9,1128,5.44
3772143,4,B001R10BC8,"Had you asked me just last week to identify a legitimate alternative to BanDai's impeccable space drama, Planetes, I would have been hard pressed to comply.  Now, having just completed my tour of Funimation's Moonlight Mile Complete First Season DVD set, the choice is clear.  Coming seemingly out of nowhere, the complete first season of the show comprises two discs for a total of 12 episodes packaged in the thin pack format (within a cardboard slip box).

To begin this review, I suppose the best way to describe it in terms of feel and style and would be to go ahead and compare it directly to Planetes (see my full review of that DVD set if that comparison means little to you).  The action in Moonlight Mile starts literally within the fist scene of the first episode with a lunar-surface sequence that hints to a whole lot of realistic action to come.  Like Planetes, Moonlight Mile combines (nearly flawlessly) a drab pallet of realistically proportioned characters with ultra-rich textured CGI sequences.  However, despite a near identical look and a common affinity for extremely realistic space physics and facts, the similarities between the two shows end there.  Where Planetes used the backdrop of space to weave a tale of innocence, the enthusiasm of youth, and the consequences of man's interaction with the cosmos, Moonlight Mile is dark, gritty, and often unforgiving in its prose.  In a lesser-crafted anime work, some of these traits may be construed as flaws but Mile builds upon these elements to get its point across quite nicely.

The story centers on two lead characters; an American Naval aviator call sign Lost Man and a Japanese building inspector/ construction worker named Goro Saruwatari.  The two may share little in common as far as background, upbringing, and culture are concerned but an attraction toward the risk and challenge involved in mountain climbing unites the duo every few years.

Upon discovering that conquering the highest peaks on the earth itself has lost its thrill, they're left wrestling with the simple notion that to go any higher would mean to journey into space itself.  And while the story takes place in a slightly more technologically advanced future, the rigors of space flight are every bit as insurmountable as they would be today.

What makes the core of the tale work so well is that the interaction between the two lead characters is anything but direct for the vast majority of the season.  Rather than lump them together in their competitive race to be the first to the moon, the show's creative staff pays careful attention to crafting two very separate and unique stories.  Sure their paths cross on more than one occasion along the way but the overall feel is almost that of a competition from opposite sides of the globe.

Throughout the 300 minutes the viewer is transported along to several locales around the planet including a snowy Russia, sunny coastal Japan, scorching Middle Eastern desert and even the mystical Area 51 all under the near-flawless portrayal of the technological space race taking place between nations.  It turns out that the future spawns a sort of United Nations banner (the International Space Agency or ISA for short) specifically catered to space travel and the common goal of using material within the moon's core as a near limitless global energy source.  Even the science there is sound, as the lunar material would act as fuel within moon-orbiting nuclear reactors whereby the byproduct (usable energy) could be transmitted to earth via microwaves.  In case you haven't noticed, the show takes a very tangible approach to the sciences contained within.

The pacing is spot on with just the right balance of action-laden space scenes (which are on more than one occasion nothing shy of spectacular) and ground-based drama.  Never does the program lose touch with the fact that this is a human-driven drama with a slight sci-fi twist for good measure.  All along the way come costly setbacks, corporate corruption, and lots of lovemaking.  I could almost go as far as to say that Moonlight Mile's greatest strength is that it is easy to get so caught up in the moment that it feels more like chronicled day-to-day occurrences than it does a single grandiose tale.  What we have here is a succession of human trials and tribulations that could, often times, have been taken directly from today's headlines.

The acting is simply flawless in both the original Japanese version and the English dub.  I try not to gush over the dub work in most series (as the standard is so high in my opinion that it need be mentioned only when a performance is sub par) but even so Moonlight Mile manages to impress.  The voice work is emotional and passionate throughout without crossing the delicate line between acting and overacting.  Casting choices of the lead and secondary roles are spot on (especially with Goro and Lost Man themselves as the actors simply nail the unique yet similar traits of their respective personalities).  I especially found myself appreciating the rare moments when the two lead characters interacted.  It was almost as if there was a sense of their underlying friendship even though each acted as though he cared little whether the other lived or not.

About my only complaint with the set itself comes in the fact that there are virtually no extras included (rare for a Funimation release).  Each disc contains six episodes of the show and the second disc's extras menu consists only of textless opening and closing themes (and some trailers).  This is one of few shows that I would loved to have been given interviews with the dub cast, the show's writers, or even just a commentary track or two over an episode.

I should also note that the TV MA (mature) 17+ rating the show wears is definitely to be taken seriously.  The language is often times on par with what is expected in a Rated R feature film and there are pretty commonly occurring nude/ sexual intercourse sequences and references throughout.  Try as I may to find fault in this fact, the show's mood just builds off such sociological references so that it's all too easy to forget that this is in fact an animated series.

My final issue is as much a complaint as it is a compliment- there happens to be a rap song that makes a couple of appearances throughout the show that I've grown quite fond of.  Trouble is, it is given no credit whatsoever on this set.  It would certainly be iPod worthy should I discover who sings it or even what it's called.  If you happen to know the answer, drop a line.  In the mean time I'll just have to go on repeating the scenes in which it appears in the hopes of picking up on a clue to solve the mystery.",1240099200,6,6729,4.8013876843018215
8337021,5,B001R10BC8,I loved this! I wish the second season were available in English. I am dying to see what will happen next!,1517961600,,106,4.095238095238095
8337022,2,B001R10BC8,"I almost gave this anime a single star, but what it actually contains is pretty good. It's engaging, interesting, and shows lots of potential.

Unfortunately, this is one anime series that makes promises it just cannot deliver. Every episode begins with a frankly epic title sequence that hints at the direction the series is building towards, but the actual episodes are meandering, aimless glimpses into the lives of people we don't really care about, driven by motivations that are difficult to relate to even if you can understand them, which much of the time you can't. It's a series that thinks it's a high-drama military science fiction but actually IS a smutty adventure anthology of loosely connected stories that never really develop in anything meaningful.

As a possible spoiler, and also a primary example: the opening episode of the series depicts an astronaut on the moon being shot and killed by a soldier in a space suit, apparently to cover up some sort of big secret she isn't supposed to know about. The series flashes back from there, apparently to show us how we got to that point, and eventually, finally, circles back to that point, that same scene, and that same doomed astronaut... and then it ENDS. Which leaves you with the sense that everything you've just watched was one incredibly long prologue to a series you will never get to see.

Honestly, it's a mildly entertaining, but it's also HIGHLY disappointing. You're probably better off skipping it and getting the manga instead.",1514592000,,1510,4.937007874015748

8337024,5,B001R10BC8,"DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN

This was literally the best anime ever to watch with my bros.  We watched it and felt like someone had decided to make a show specifically for the 25-40 crowd who enjoys drinking, carousing, and unprofessional behavior.

Had delayed reviewing because we went through the first 5 or 6 episodes and had a great time, but we haven't come back to finish it (other life responsibilities intervened).

We were all inspired to reach a little higher and to loosen our ties a bit and relax, and wholeheartedly enjoyed the crass sense of humor.

The plot and characters are ridiculous (although not quite gaogaigar level) and the situations we saw pretty direct.  Was worth it for us.

But definitely don't watch this around kids!  It is definitely not appropriate as the protagonists are hot blooded, confident men and there's enough drinking and carousing and pursuing the ladies for an Alexander Dumas novel.  The first episode will give you exactly the right impression as to what's in store.",1446163200,2,1015,4.923529411764706

8337026,5,B001R10BC8,"This 2007 series, based on the manga by Yasuo Otagaki, centers on two long time mountaineering companions, the loveably loutish Goro Saruwatari and snidely cynical Jack 'Lostman' Woodbridge, who, while atop Mt. Everest, realize that for them there are no more mountains left to climb--on Earth that is.  Inspired by the sight of the ISA (International Space Association) Space Station passing overhead, they decide to become astronauts, with the goal of 'climbing' to the Moon, though they wind up taking very different paths to achieve their shared goal--and that's enough here; spoiling it any further would be a darn shame.
The real shame, however, is that only the first season was licensed here, initially, in '07, by ADV Films, but acquired by FUNimation in '08 in the wake of ADV's demise, and at this remove it seems unlikely that FUN is going to get season 2 (far as I know they've never finished up an incomplete series acquired from another US distributor), unless of course they get enough requests for it...
But anyway, it's time for me to sign off and get back to identifying the last four clip shows in Transformers Victory (gad, an anime researcher's work is never done--thank goodness!)
One more thing; if you like this sort of thing, I highly recommend Mighty Space Miners and Planetes (both available via Amazon, I believe, plug, plug).",1402099200,,1355,4.942982456140351

8337029,5,B001R10BC8,"I really like Anime, and I came across this Series because I wanted Anime with great graphics as well as decent content. I loved the movie Appleseed ExMachina, which I thought was better then the first Appleseed movie. The
graphics are great, really astounding actually, and the story was pretty good.

So I searched and searched for more of that same really high edged ultra cool graphics that Appleseed ExMachina has, and I found this. What I liked about this set is that the series succeeds in keeping my interest peeked, the episodes have pretty good story lines, and the graphics are very high quality, none of that usual washed out looking graphics that most anime seems to always have.

The setting is in space, in the not so distant future and is realistically centered around a few of earth's space stations, a small moon colony, things that aren't so far fetched or absurdly depicted like intergalactic warp drive Sci Fi nonsense.
The plot is very humorous a lot of times, and there are plenty of everyday examples of ""real"" heroism, when scared people just do their jobs, going that extra distance to cope with everyday hardships that come up as they always will, and that comes with this territory.

This is the complete set of the first year I believe. It is the best set available. i know as I ordered the same episodes by mistake
( I thought they were the second season episodes but they weren't ) and that set cost more money and didn't look as good nor was it organized as well.

With a touch of just the right amount of ""independent thinking and actions"" and individuals who stand up for their rights against corporate interests and who care more about each other as a team facing hazardous space duty (debris collection duties) the episodes are all very good, with very likable characters, and plenty of tense moments. There is a great deal of plain old human warmth for their fellow man/woman, and some very amusing and sometimes very moving human interactions.

I really enjoyed watching all of the episodes and will watch them through again and again. I just can't find the second years episodes on Amazon. That would be my only small complaint, but I haven't tried seriously searching for that yet.
There are plenty of potential sources I haven't checked yet.

Overall I would really recommend this series. You will really enjoy the sharp and well done graphics, and some of the graphics of Planet Earth taken from Earths orbit are almost breathtaking in their beauty. All in all this is a very entertaining series done with above grade animation work that is not at all ""stiff"" like some CGI can usually come across.",1379894400,,2640,4.703463203463204
