994486,5,6305211973,"This is quintessential Keiko, her performance is only matched by  the level of clarity that this DVD is filmed/recorded at. I especially enjoyed the piano solos.  Order it! You won't be disappointed! p.s. What are these ""whales"" reviews doing on this page?",982800000,,256,5.071428571428571
994487,5,6305211973,"The BET production facility was quite good -- an amply sized staged, good lighting, excellent camera work, and an intimate crowd of between fifty and one hundred.
Keiko opened with the title track of her most recent studio release, ""Whisper From The Mirror"". She then travelled back in time, covering favorites from many of her studio releases, including the ever popular ""Safari"" and ""Bridge Over the Stars"".
The special treats of this performance are the only live recording of ""Foot Steps"" -- a wonderfully extended version of this song -- as well as a shakuhachi version of ""Light Above The Trees"". The finale -- her ""Blues Jam"", which has never been recorded in any format, is always a favorite and brings the house down at her concerts -- if you've never seen it before, you're in for show!
All in all, a wonderful and classy performance by Keiko...",982627200,31,855,4.783783783783784
994581,5,6305211973,Excellant performance and good sound quality. Highly recommend purchasing this dvd if your a fan of Keieko's.,1207699200,,109,5.470588235294118
994582,4,6305211973,Keiko Matsui is one of my favorites Jazz/New Age musicians. Saw her live in Boston Summer Concerts a few years ago. Have most of her CDs. This is my first DVD of hers. Don't expect too much of stage performance but music!,1153180800,,221,4.285714285714286
994583,4,6305211973,"Keiko Matsui brings to the stage of BET Jazz a solid performance of some of her more well-known songs (as of 2000), complemented by a good supporting band and the virtuoso bamboo flute playing of her husband, Kazu.  Typical of most of Keiko's music, many of the numbers introduce a musical motif, move on to an improvisational middle section, then end with a more glorious layering of instrumentation.  Any follower of smooth jazz will recognize her formula, and it plays well for this show.
I would describe most of the numbers as uplifting; however, some diversity is added with the heartfelt ""Forever, Forever,"" written for Keiko's daughter, the ethereal compositions featuring Kazu's flute (""shakuhachi"" in Japanese), and the jazzed up tempo to some of the hits.  ""Bridge Over the Stars"" was noteworthy with it's altered (from the original studio version) tempo and much cooler ending.  ""White Gate"" was really up-tempo with bass and drums alternating flourishes.  Keiko works well with the other band members and trades off some hip riffs with sax-man Greg Reilly on a song or two.  Personally, I'm not convinced that the shakuhachi works all that well as a jazz instrument, but I can't criticize the inventiveness in employing a traditional Japanese flute along with contemporary jazz instrumentation.  Jazz aside, the last song is a BLUES number, trading off between featured soloists, including Kazu (""Wanna check it out?"") with his breathy flute intro.
Overall, the camera work, editing and the sound quality are all very good.  No major negatives with this disc, although the run time of 84 minutes left me wanting a bit more, and the DVD extras aren't that captivating (11-minute interview with Keiko and a 30-second TV spot).  Still, this is a performance that any jazz fan can enjoy.",1086825600,12,1796,5.061016949152543
994584,4,6305211973,"Well, like other BET productions, this one has very nice video and DTS audio.  Video still suffers from occasional shots of a completely dark crowd.  Audio gripes include lame sounding saxaphone (D. Matthews Band - Live from Central Park is reference standard)
My main disappointment is that Keiko doesn't play the REAL PIANO on more tracks.  I think about 5 tracks have real piano.  It is very well recorded and beautiful sounding.  Unfortunately all the other tracks feature electronic synth piano which pales in comparison.
Highlight is the gentleman playing the oriental flute.  Wonderfully recorded.  Fabulous control over the instrument.
Overall 4/5 due to the sax recording quality and the lack of more tracks with the majestic sounding real piano.",1078272000,6,755,5.241666666666666
994585,5,6305211973,"Sonically,  the DTS is very very clean and well mixed.  No over done surround that make lots of music videos sound artificial.  Therefore I can't hear much of difference between DTS and 2 channel ( this is by no means a bad thing though ).  All the tracks are well chosen and are of her best.  Here is a list of her albums that I own and in the order from my most favorite:
1. Dream Walk
2. Deep Blue
3. Full Moon and a Shrine
4. Doll
5. White Owl
6. Whisper in the Mirror
7. Under the Northern Lights
Video is very clean as well.  Well match the mood of the music.  Classy and simple.  I appreciate the good taste of the production.  This is a jazz video so don't need all the fancy high tech visual effects IMHO.
Keiko herself is awesome!  Her whole persona is like magic.  I am Chinese so I probably appreciate more of her subtle, low key and subdued style.  She is just LOVELY!  If you are Keiko fan then this DVD is a must have for you.",1078185600,19,941,4.021621621621621
994586,5,6305211973,"Keiko at her finest. Sound is tremendous. If you have dts you will know what I mean. Super tight band. What more can I say?? Keiko, the true professional.",1073606400,7,154,4.344827586206897
994587,5,6305211973,"After a few listens, I decided that this DVD is a ""must own"" performace. Comparing to Diana Krall, Keiko's handling of the keyboard looks a little rough, very business like but she gets the sound that we want to hear. She starts with ""Whisper from the mirror"".. moves through to ""Bridge over the stars"" .. a typcially racy smooth jazz number. ""White gate"" is my favorite.. a dash of Al DiMeola, Santana, El Chicano etc. Kazu is a genius on Shakuhachi, very enjoyable music. Check out the audio CD ""Walls of Akendora"" by Keiko - it comes with a BONUS DVD..",1070150400,6,555,4.5049504950495045
994588,5,6305211973,"I am very impressed with this DVD. A smooth blend between an Asian sound and jazz. This lady has magical fingers on the keyboards. They do a piece at the end that even blends in a touch of blues. That's right I said blues - it is GREAT - you have to check it out. Every person that I have demonstrated with, loved it also.",1052092800,5,322,3.9692307692307693
994589,5,6305211973,"Although Keiko has trouble interviewing and coming off as confident personally, it's obvious her strengths are in performing and writing music which rivals George Winston in it's emotional impact and draw on the soul. Sometimes you may feel she is perhaps heading no where with a piece only to realize that even the gaps have been placed there for effect. Her repetitive speach in her short interviews between pieces reflects much of her concentration on the hypnotic. This brought up references to...of all things, Led Zepplin music.... but don't get me wrong there is no crunch and munch here... the effect is much more beautiful and soothing, and thankfully there is no wailing. :-) If you like to watch your musicians, this is a great video, for every part, be it bass, drums or someone who plays the oriental reed pipe...yes, they put jazz backing to the kind of music you once heard only on Kung Fu... amazing!!! Best thing since Vanessa Mae for people of all races and musical colors. Buy it now!",992390400,9,1003,4.7701149425287355
