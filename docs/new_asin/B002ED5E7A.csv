If we say it was made in 2002, then its two stars, Adele Haenel and Vincent Rottiers, who play 12 year old twins abandoned at a young age in a basket by their mother, would have been 13 and 16 years old respectively at the time this remarkable film was made.  The two actors give such disarmingly mature performances that one is tempted to say that only French cinema could have encompassed such a range of juvenile emotions brought to the screen in such a mature fashion.  Vincent Rottiers has gone on to make many films in France - Adele Haenel surprisingly few, although she was nominated for a Cesar award for Most Promising Actress for Waterlilies in 2007.  In Les Diables she gives an astonishing performance in the very demanding role of Chloe, who is not only autistic but profoundly emotionally disturbed. This is a big ask of a 13 year old, but she is completely convincing.  Christophe Ruggia was 37 years old when he directed this, only his second feature film. I don't believe he has directed anything since.
I think this film would have a wide audience among broadminded film goers, and highly recommend it.",1283385600,5,1202,4.576744186046511

8367550,4,B002ED5E7A,"The opening credits of the convincing and painful Les Diables are accompanied by a plaintive song about children who 'fly away.' We see two abandoned children, Chloe and Joseph, on their way to Marseilles, to a non existent 'home'. They seem to have seen a lot more misery in the world than should match their age, 15 and 12 respectively. The catatonic, silent Chloe is protected with all his might by her younger brother, who is continuously conscious of his sister's looming lapse. Tacking between well meaning adults and disinterested authorities, Les Diables follows the urgent quest of brother and sister for family, for a home that doesn't really exist. In the end, the film, sustained by the young Haenel and Rottiers who have rightly been praised for their powerful and intense performance, is largely a road movie about growing up.  Truly an amazing film, which makes me wonder why it was never really well received outside of France.  Perhaps, in the end, the subtle subject matter wasn't appealing to mainstream distributors.  This version comes with optional English subtitles.",1245888000,6,1089,5.072625698324022
