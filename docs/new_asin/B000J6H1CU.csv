8325266,1,B000J6H1CU,This product was of extremely poor quality. The visual and audio appeared to have been a copy of a copy!!!,1230595200,,106,4.35
8325267,4,B000J6H1CU,"I found this ""how to"" program very entertaining - I wish Mr Mortimer would have been my teacher when I was in school! I was given Computers for Beginners as a gift, and although I feel I know computer basics, this DVD taught me things, simple things, I was totally unaware of. I played it on my computer so I could work along if I wanted - the visual quality was fine. I would certainly recommend it.",1219017600,,400,4.207792207792208
8325268,4,B000J6H1CU,"I think this product does what it says it will...it teaches beginners.  It is necessary to follow the instructions that recommend using it on a computer for good quality, NOT on a television screen where the quality is reduced.  I recommend this product for beginners.",1199404800,,268,4.933333333333334
8325269,1,B000J6H1CU,"Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. Between the rapid variances in sound and cheesy blue screen animations, this program is a dud. The presenter mumbles in a monotone and uses cheesy transitions. At one point he even beams himself up. Look elsewhere for quality computer education DVDs; the Web Wise Seniors series is a good bet, and will work for all beginners--not just seniors.",1173657600,7,388,4.8059701492537314
