It was fun to share the DVD with some previously innocent dance instructors.",1420070400,,305,4.5636363636363635
8154195,5,B000K3EG8E,"This is something special.  Other people have given you detailed descriptions.  But there are levels of emotion that you have to see.  An old Mummer recalls songs you may never have heard.  A bunch of perfectly normal guys ...... dressed up as geishas and dancing.  Learn how to do the Strut, and how it came to be.  A member of a club dies, and the band plays in tribute.  A Mummer's Mass.  Froggy Carr.  Best quotes: ""You've never really been a man 'til you've worn high heels.""  ""When they let him (captain of a club) out of jail (after a New Year's Day parade incident) it was like .....Gandhi.""

You don't have to be from Philly.  Good stuff.",1404604800,,647,4.389830508474576

8154197,5,B000K3EG8E,"I grew up in Philadelphia and the Mummers Parade every New Year's Day. It  was juat as special as the Macy's Thanksgiving parade to us. At 70, I can still do a good Mummer's Strut! What a thrill to be able to see it relived on this movie...and as it turns out...produced by Max Rabb, a man I knew and worked for. Once you move from Philadelphia, you never get to see the Mummer's Parade on New Year's Day again... a tragedy relived every January 1st.",1367366400,,450,4.232558139534884
8154198,5,B000K3EG8E,"I love the Mummers Parade, but I've always had a hard time explaining why to my friends who've never heard of the Mummers before.  Now all I need to do is show them this movie!",1327190400,,176,4.0285714285714285

The colder the better - the music just rang out!  I realize now that I live far away tjat this was a unique way to begin every New Year - ENERGY, MUSIC, COLOR, DANCE, HUMOR, FANTASY - WOW!  What a dynamic, imaginative beginning to the New Year.  Thank you Philadelphia Mummers, and thank you MaxLRaab and Robt Downey Sr for creating a film that captures so many aspects of the Mummer's culture and annual parade.  You included so many of the elements that I recall from the spiffy, highly costumed string-bands to the somewhat drunk-and-disorderly roaming bands of men in flaxen wigs or hobo getups.  You had the African-American musicians, (although I might have liked to have seen more of the African-American bands and representatives of other neighborhoods besides South Philly, although I know the nucleus of the parade is centered there), the comics, the Elvis-impersonators (Philly has always been a big music city, was the original site of American Bandstand, etc), great footage of the 2000 parade, archival footage, interviews with club captains and some focus on individual performers, and the raucous 'mob scenes', and some lovely touches too - the photo montages, and also in one scene a man in a wheelchair, just off to the side, is greeted by a Mummer who gives him a kiss and a hug.  Just great stuff.  You captured the love that goes into this parade and that creates community in philly.  of course, it's also fun to see real he-men, as they used to be called, who enjoy dressing up in women's garb, makeup, fantastic costumery, and who can play the saxophone, banjo or xylophone at the same time. (Hey, more xylophones next time!) It was totally a great viewing experience, and I will be watching it every New Year's from here on out.",1262476800,3,1942,4.702064896755163
