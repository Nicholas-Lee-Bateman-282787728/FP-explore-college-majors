2214045,5,B0007IO6V4,"Glorious, glamourous, intriguing, touching and melodramatic - that's Dynasty for you. No television series was ever better or more beatifully set than Dynasty...",1109635200,2,161,6.043478260869565
2214046,5,B0007IO6V4,"The wait is finally over! The mansion! The catfights! The issues! The shoulderpads! After years of pleading and e-mailing, the many fans of this TV Classic (and there are many more than anyone is ready to acknowledge) can rejoyce in this first season DVD set. In spite of the noticeable absence of Joan Collins, who will appear from the beginning of season two, we find all the elements that made this series simply the most elegant, style defining TV show of the '80s. And now, dear fans, it's time to start the ""release season two"" campaign!!!",1109635200,4,545,4.6875
2214047,5,B0007IO6V4,"Dynasty is what a true ""Guilty Pleasure"" should be like. All that glitters in this show is gold. It was delightful, funny, glamorous romantic and at times down right catty! It was great to see Krystle Carrington and Alexis Morell Carrington Colby Dexter Colby (played wonderfully by Linda Evans and Joan Collins)  go at it tooth and nail, Literally! It gets really better (in my opinion) during the 9th and final season when Alexis' cousin Sable (The great Stephanie Beacham from the Dynasty spinoff The Colbys) joins the cast. She is Alexis' equal in bitchiness and gives as good as she gets. Sable is nothing like Krystle. She makes a promise to Krystle  to keep Blake safe from Alexis and boy does she! Can't wait.",1108857600,3,717,4.728
2214048,5,B0007IO6V4,"Dynasty was a show that truly epitomized the 80's.

The first season of Dynasty follows the story of Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans), a whimpy woman who marries wealthy oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). As she struggles adjusting to her new life of wealth dealing with insubordinate servants as well as her new jealous stepdaughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin), Krystle is torn between loyalty to Blake and a lingering love for her ex-lover Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins), former employee and now business rival to Blake.

Dynasty was also one of the first television shows in history to feature a gay character as a series regular. Blake's son Steven (Al Corley) gets caught up in his own struggles as he gets a job working for his father's business competitor Matthew, as well as secretly getting romantically involved with Matthew's wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) while trying to forget his lover from college.

But the real highlight of the first season is Pamela Sue Martin, who plays Blake's spoiled daughter Fallon. Krystle is such a whimpy character, and it is always entertaining to see Fallon being mean to her. Fallon sleeps with her father's chauffer Michael (Wayne Northrop) and makes a deal with wealthy oil tycoon Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner) to marry his nephew Jeff (John James) in exchange that Cecil bail Blake's company out from having to file bankruptcy.

Without Joan Collins and Heather Locklear, who didn't show up until the second season, the first season of Dynasty was hardly the show everybody remembers and loves. It was more of a Dallas imitation. Blake was like J.R. Ewing, the antagonist of the show, Krystle was a boring, whimpy version of Pamela Barnes, marrying into a wealthy family while having torn loyalties, and Fallon was a more conniving Lucy Ewing, sleeping with the chauffer/ranch hand and not getting along with the new lady in the house. But once Joan Collins showed up to play Blake's scheming ex-wife Alexis, the show really started to come into its own and became one of the signature shows of the 80's.",1108080000,46,2058,4.973837209302325
2214049,2,B0007IO6V4,"Dynasty was not nearly as good as Dallas. I never watched Dynasty, until now. Actors in Dynasty were not even close to those on Dallas; the story-line is not as good either. No one could possibly touch one-of-a-kind Larry Hagman as J. R. Ewing and beautiful Linda Grey as Sue Ellen Ewing. They were unbelievable. Then there was Dallas veteran stars gentle Barbara Belle Geddes and majestic Howard Keel. John Forsythe and terrible Linda Evans were very poor in comparison. They did bring in Charlton Heston and Barbara Stanwyck for a few episodes in Dynasty, but their parts were relatively insignificant. The only actress that truly holds her own in Dynasty, is glamorous Joan Collins; but still a weaker Linda Grey, in the actress department. Without Collins, Dynasty would not be worth watching. My two stars are for her.",1486166400,,823,4.928057553956834

2214061,5,B0007IO6V4,"Not as glamorous as the seasons to follow.
The acting is top notch!
Season 1 is very romantic, that you don't see today.
The girl who plays Lyndsey - very convincing with the  teen issues.
The best scenes are with Fallon and Blake. She does not listen to anyone but her father. She's a player, which would be considered - in those days- unladylike.
Krystal character is very meek and withdrawn in season one. Krystal character does not develop until the arrival of Alexis.

Don't take my word for it, watch and see.

Enjoy ",1484697600,2,523,4.531914893617022

2214075,5,B0007IO6V4,"It's really very interesting to watch Dynasty now, as it seems US politics of power, wealth, greed, and foreign and domestic oil struggles are just as relevant, corrupt, and decadent now as when the series took off in the early 1980's.  The series is entertaining and surprisingly not as dated as one might think, given the present political and economic situation and wealth inequalities of our time.  A captivating portrait of privilege, family, betrayal, and corruption of the 1980's.  An fascinating warped mirror to our present time. And a true guilty pleasure that's fun to watch!",1482537600,3,586,5.083333333333333

2214077,4,B0007IO6V4,"Episode 1 introduced a strange situation for an unCoolorado *anything* to treat homosexuality as a questionable activity of Steven Carrington while their schools compel criminal assaults in the secondary schools and same gender bedroom partners in the state Loonie Verse Itty to compel homosexual regimentation.  Heteros are persecuted beyond those regimentations in the lesbian run divorce racketeering industry and so far as to threaten an alleged hetero with prosecution for hetero behaviors to prevent her from serving as complaining witness against the Denver mayor's son arrested with felony quantities of cocaine for sale (with the end result of getting the corrupt District Attorney subsequently elected goofernor of the state).  Then too there was the Kristalnacht exhibition perpetrated by the Denver Brawn Cos ""fans"" destroying the downtown area while the ""police department"" only looked on to ""persuade"" the legis critters to authorize taxation thefts from the humans of a five county area to build a prettier homosexual dominance ritual ""stadium"".  Then in Episode 4 we see the standard poisoning of Fallon's agreed prospective spouse Jeff with the socially destructive Marriage You Wanna, not yet 'legalized"" at the time the episode was filmed but a standard lesbian thug procedure in unCoolorado.  Contradictions of the reality of the narcophony homosexist cesspool of unCoolorado to the contrary notwithstanding, it is a well photographed and acted series of telebitchin pogroms worthy of a four star rating.",1482019200,,1524,5.584415584415584

It was interesting to watch it again so many years later.  The first season is probably the best season.  The characters are introduced and there are conflicts that are really well put together and well acted.  The later seasons pretty much just put the characters in a cuisinart and let the viewers watch them get all chopped up and suffer.",1476316800,,479,4.459770114942529

It established the characters but with the arrival of Alexis and Season 2, so many things changed about the show for the better. Season 1 showed a darker side to Blake Carrington, but that would change as John Forsythe wanted his character to be less villainous. Season 1 also had the zzz ... zzz ...

Handsome John Forsythe was amazing, and so feisty. And the sets--the vanity tables laden with perfume bottles and exquisite figurines, the breakfast table, the fashions. I would love to go back to the 1980s, and want to live in the Carrington mansion!",1465948800,6,603,4.644859813084112

2214165,5,B0007IO6V4,"LOVE!!!!!  I had no idea that ""Dynasty"" tackled the day's hot-button social issues, such as the U.S.'s dependence on foreign oil and homosexuality.  The acting and writing are both very strong during this season.  I'm a few episodes in to Season 2 & it seems more romantic, with heavier swells of music and more melodramatic situations.  Season 1 you'll see barroom brawls and protests in the Middle East.  Season 2 I think it's more about Alexis.  Once Joan Collins enters the picture, forget it.  In both seasons you get to see Jeff Colby in swim trunks.  That's good enough for me.  ;)",1463356800,2,588,4.686274509803922

It's really good, has lots of drama and keeps you wondering what is the real motive behind it? and the subjects they discuss...i can only imagine how this sparked up controversy during the 80's .

It has been fantastic to revisit the saga and take that trip down memory lane. I look forward to the day when the series is released in a complete package on DVD or Blu-ray so that I can purchase it. Excellent performances given by Joan Collins as Alexis, John Forsythe as Blake, Linda Evans as Krystle, and Diahann Carroll as Dominique, and a host of others.",1440374400,,497,4.413043478260869

The greed is still alive today unfortunately. Still around the oil business. Seeing Denver's skyline of yesteryear is interesting.,1440288000,,269,5.136363636363637
2214376,5,B0007IO6V4,"Dynasty was the must see TV show back in the 80's. This was long before On Demand or DVR's and VCR's were state of the art technology that cost more than a used car, so you actually had to be home to watch TV shows when they aired. When I saw this on Amazon Prime I got an urge for some 80's TV kitsch and was surprised to discover it is still a very good TV drama with a hilarious 80's non-PC edge. The show broke ground by having the first gay main character on a TV series (Billy Chrystal's portrayal of ""Jodie Dallas"" on the 70's sitcom Soap was more for comedic effect) yet upon discovering his son is gay the show's patriarch ""Blake Carrington"" says to him ""What should I do make you vice president in charge of faggotry?"" Say WHAAAT? You would never hear that on TV today, not even on a Seth MacFarlane production! Linda Evans portrayal of the beautiful, meek (and somewhat dim) ""Krystle Jennings Carrington"" is equally painful and mesmerizing, while Pamela Sue Martin's sassy but slu**y ""Fallon Carrington"" is delightful. Her departure after season four was the worst thing to happen to Dynasty and made exponentially worse by the characters replacement, Emma Samms, who is the only British actor in history who cannot play an American. It is hard enough to accept a new face on a popular TV character but a whole new ethnicity? This was the beginning of the end for the show but for now I am enjoying season one and look forward to the season two addition of Joan Collins as the exquisitely wicked ""Alexis Carrington"" Blake's ex-wife. One of the shows most memorable and hilarious scenes is when ""Cecil Colby"" who is Blake's business rival and Alexis' fiance, has a heart attack in bed after they passionately makes love. Alexis doesn't bother dialing 911, she starts pounding on his chest and screaming at him ""Don't' you dare die on me!"" Now that was must see TV!  Forget the BS reality TV shows filling the airwaves today with contrived discourse and melodramatic morons, seasons 1-4 of Dynasty is the most outrageous and entertaining TV ever.",1440201600,2,2055,4.614754098360656

2214414,2,B0007IO6V4,"Don't get me wrong, I adore Dynasty having grown up on it; but season one is horrible.  I basically made it through just to refresh my memory for season 2 when things get good.  Many of the story lines from season one are boring and offensive and dated.  I do get how revolutionary it was for the time to have a gay character, but I really struggled with how horribly he was treated and how quickly he went from being gay to just confused and then straight. Just as bad was the rape of Krystal by her own husband.  I skipped a lot of it to get to season 2.",1438992000,,556,4.027272727272727

The cast was perfect for the story line and script. There are times when threads of the story drag a little, but that was more reflective of the era than acting talent or screen writing. It was the way all TV dramas played back then, even the iconic Dallas.",1437523200,,403,4.534246575342466

The rich elegance and chic style that is Dynasty. I was too young to watch the earlier seasons, but I remember all the adults gossiping about it at the beauty salon and of course being quiet when I heard the horns of the opening sequence!

She comes from a middle class background and soon finds out that great wealth can bring blessings and curses.

 The blessings are a  large house with an endless amount of servants, large cars,  horses, trips anywhere in the world, luxury unlimited, and large closets full of clothes.

 But then come the curses: spoiled stepchildren, poor relations being dumped on her doorstep, constant chances of kidnappings and ruthless ex-spouses who are willing to do anything to destroy her marriage.",1414972800,,626,5.019417475728155

2214476,3,B0007IO6V4,"In the early 1980s, CBS had two nighttime soap operas that were hugely popular in the Nielsen ratings: Dallas was #1 and its spin-off Knots Landing was #22. Jealous ABC was anxious to have their own nighttime serial to compete CBS. To that end, Richard and Esther Shapiro gave ABC a script entitled Oil, about a wealthy oil family living in Denver, Colorado, similar to the Ewings on Dallas. Before the class act went to air, the show became DYNASTY.

In the three-part pilot episode, we are introduced to the Carrington family who ""live and sin"" in a 48-room mansion. The family's headed by Blake (John Forsythe), who is about to marry his former secretary, the younger Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans). Krystle is not overly expected into Blake's billion dollar world, and is especially disliked by his snotty majordomo Joseph Anders (Lee Bergere) and his spoiled daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin). Krystle's only ally is her stepson Steven (Al Corley), who has recently revealed his homosexuality, and is quarreling with Blake.

These early plots deal with Steven's ""coming out"" and his arguments with Blake; Krystle struggling to be expected by Blake's family; Fallon's affair with Carrington chauffeur, Michael Culhane (Wayne Northrop), to which Blake disapproves; Fallon's dream love being Blake's friend/enemy Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner); Fallon marrying Cecil's nephew Jeff (John James) because of a business deal with Cecil; Steven becoming involved with Ted Dinard (Mark Withers), who Blake kills in episode 11.

Playing counterpart to the Carringtons are the Blaisdels; Denver-Carrington geologist Matthew (Bo Hopkins) -- unhappily married to the emotionally fragile Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) -- is Krystle's ex-lover. The Blaisdels daughter Lindsay (Katy Kurtzman) fells unwanted and neglected. Returning from an extended assignment in the Middle East, Matthew quits and goes into business with wildcatter Walter Lankershim (Dale Robertson), and as Blake's behavior begins pushing Krystle toward Matthew, the men are set as both business and romantic rivals.

These first 13 episodes that started the Dynasty trend are entertaining. It's a bit campy, but that's Dynasty, from season 1 to season 9. It's direct and a bit more racy than Dallas and especially more ritzy. Season 2 is were this show really gets good, but if you cut these episodes out completely, you'll be lost. This is why ABC added Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington, the scheming, but gorgeous ex-wife of Blake the following season, to spice things up. The ratings were low during this initial year, with Dynasty coming in 38th in the spring of 1981. This is a fair season, but don't be baffled that this what Dynasty was, it isn't. Check out seasons 2 through 5.",1382659200,2,2741,5.208616780045351

Between Disc one (1) and (2), the outside labeling of Episodes is wrong, i.e. Episodes are missing. And since the episodes are NOT labelled on the discs (you cannot see on the TV which Episodes are playing, despite the facts you have to watch the credits again and again) this defect is harder to detect. You have to sense to discontinuity in the history line ! I would like to be shown that it is my mistake and that I am missing something, but we checked the discs again and again.

2214487,5,B0007IO6V4,"Against a backdrop of the glistening snow-capped mountains of Colorado and the sprawling Carrington estate, the real stars of this show line up in contrast to that beauty...Let's meet them:  Greed, Deceit, Power, Cattiness, Adultery and your basic Hatred.  You know... everything you need to make a night-time soap as sudsy as possible, and, oh, let me tell you... ""Dynasty"" was surrounded in those bubbles.

When Krystle tells her fianc, Blake Carrington, that she would like Chinese food and doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he fires up his jet and they zoom off to San Francisco...to Chinatown.  That's classic oil tycoon Blake. And this is quintessential ""Dynasty.""  Big lives, great wealth and glamour as far as the eye can see.  Welcome to the 80's, where we dreamed in glorious Technicolor and liked our entertainment just as glorious and over the top.

The first season started in January of 1981, so it's shorter with 13 episodes plus a two-hour movie that introduced the series.  It was Aaron Spelling's answer to ""Dallas.""  And his answer to Dallas' boots and Stetsons?  Tuxes and jewels.

And if ever there were two people who represented elegance, beauty and wealth, it would be John Forsythe and Linda Evans as Blake and Krystle Carrington.  He's dapper; she's refined.  He has a golden voice; she has jewel-like eyes.  These chiseled, specimens of pulchritude must have made central casting jump up and down with glee the first time they saw them in a tux and evening gown.

The stories revolve around Blake and Krystle, their new marriage and the problems a nice, soft-spoken girl from Ohio has fitting in with his power-hungry lifestyle.  The cast of characters around them causing conflict and distress are:
Fallon - Blake's spoiled daughter from his first marriage.  She is sleeping her way through Denver...chauffeurs, Denver Broncos, her father's friends...you name it.  Pamela Sue Martin brings humor to this part and is very enjoyable every time she's on the screen.
Steven - Blake's son from his first marriage is gay, but then he's bi-sexual - mostly because I think the show couldn't make up their minds.  At any rate, Al Corley plays the part beautifully.  He's never a caricature.  Frankly, some of the actors portraying gay characters today could take a lesson or two.
Jeff Colby - Fallon's new husband
Matthew Blaisdel - Krystle's former boyfriend and Blake's former employee
Claudia Blaisdel - Matthew's wife, who just got out of a mental-health hospital.
And...the Clothes - Yes, that's right.  I'm that girl.  The clothes are a character to me.  Or maybe I should say designer Nolan Miller was.  Everyone looks beautiful, and Linda Evans has gorgeous gowns and even beautiful everyday clothes.  Ah, a girl can dream.

There are more characters, but that's the core group contributing to all of the crazy.  With Matthew and Claudia, the show goes away from the mansion from time to time, but the creators said the audience always wanted to be in the world of wealth, which is where the stories were focused after season one.  Anyone looking for Joan Collins should know she doesn't show up until the second season.  We get a glimpse of her character, but never see her face.  The producers wanted to hire Joan, but the network executives thought she was too old.  Creator Esther Shapiro said they fought about it over the summer.  I wonder if anyone was pushed into a pool...

The DVD quality is excellent, the colors are beautiful and there are some good extras:  Character profiles, Esther Shapiro and Al Corley do commentary on a few episodes and ""Family, Furs and Fun:  Creating Dynasty"" with William and Esther Shapiro, Corley and Pamela Sue Martin.

I highly recommend ""Dynasty.""  Pour yourself a glass of champagne and drift yourself into a Dynasty dream of diamonds, emeralds and...lies.  Oh, My!",1340150400,2,3850,4.946957878315133

2214489,4,B0007IO6V4,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

In the debut season, we first meet oil magnate Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), the tough but fair CEO of Denver-Carrington, as he's preparing to marry former secretary Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans).  The show's opening story, ""Oil"", is spread over three episodes and sets up the characters and plots that would unfold throughout the season.

Sweet-as-pie Krystle is met with all-out resentment by Blake's stuffy butler (SORRY, ""major domo"") Joseph, played to perfection by Lee Bergere, and the staff follow suit.  Meanwhile, Blake's grown children are causing their own headaches.  Wild child Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) proudly admits to bedding half the players on Carrington's football team and is also carrying on with studly chauffeur Michael (Wayne Northrop).  In the midst of all the bed-hopping comes a tantalising deal from Blake's chief rival Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner): if Fallon marries Cecil's nephew Jeff (John James, of the quizzical expressions and upturned eyebrows), he'll absorb the $9.5 million debt owed by Blake and help the continued association between Denver-Carrington and ColbyCo.

Blake's son Steven (Al Corley) is another kettle of fish altogether.  Returning to Denver after spending a year in New York with his...da-da-dum...gay lover Ted (Mark Withers), Steven's relationship with his father (and sexuality) goes through some particularly bumpy patches, to say the least.  Steven was the first regular gay character on a soap and broke many boundaries.

On the other side of the social divide we find the middle-class Blaisdel clan.  Matthew (Bo Hopkins) was kicked out of the Middle East, where he managed oil wells belonging to Denver-Carrington.  Lovely wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) has suffered a breakdown and spent a long spell in a mental institution, and daughter Lindsay (Katy ""New Adventures of Heidi"" Kurtzman) spends all her time looking like she's on the verge of bursting into tears.  Yawn.  Audiences didn't really enjoy their involvement in the show, and the Blaisdel family was written out after the first year, except for good ole ""Crazy Claudia"" who provided lots of value in some of DYNASTY's best storylines in the years to come.

And what of the legendary Alexis (Joan Collins)?  Well, you'll have to stick out the entire first season before she makes her dazzling entrance as the surprise witness in the last episode.  Starting in Season 2, Alexis pulls no punches in her vendetta against Krystle and the war on Denver-Carrington.  The show is still enjoyable without Alexis, but the last few episodes seem to drag a lot in their build-up to her arrival.

This set features all 15 episodes from the first season, retrospective ""Family, Furs & Fun: Creating Dynasty""; and mini featurettes on the Fallon and Steven characters including recent interviews with Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley.

2214491,5,B0007IO6V4,"The saga of a wealthy Denver family in the oil business: Blake Carrington(John Forsythe), the patriarch; Krystle Jennings Carrington(Linda Evans), his former secretary and wife; his children: Adam, lost in childhood after a kidnapping; Fallon, pampered and spoiled; Steven, openly gay; and Amanda, hidden from him by his ex-wife, the conniving Alexis(Joan Collins).

Most of the show features the conflict between 2 large corporations, Blake's Denver Carrington and Alexis' Colby Co. Passion, glamour, catfights, and the biggest shoulder pads in Denver. DYNASTY, was the primetime soap fueled by an all-star cast and ""sexsational"" storylines.

Relive the wrestling matches between Alexis and Krystle, Steven's scandalous romances, Fallon's affairs with practically everybody, and of course, the power struggles at Denver-Carrington, led by the magnetic Blake Carrington.

DYNASTY was an awesome over-the-top nighttime soap opera about a bunch of rich-people humping each other that ran on ABC from Monday January 12, 1981 thru Thursday May 11, 1989 that was in competition with CBS's prime-time soap opera DALLAS, which debuted in the Spring of 1978, plus DYNASTY revolved around a wealthy oil family living in Denver, Colorado by powerful oil tycoon Blake and his new wife who is also Blake's former secretary Krystle.

DYNASTY was originally supposed to make its debut on ABC in the Fall of 1980, but was delayed till the Winter of 1981, due to a strike precipated by animosity.

This popular series ratings for the 1st Season were unremarkable, but the 2nd Season with the arrival of Alexis and Heather Locklear as Krystal's sexy greedy niece(Sammy Jo Dean)in the Fall of 1981 heralded DYNASTY's arise into the Top 20 in the Nielsen ratings and by 1984 DYNASTY was a Top 10 show and by 1985, it was the #1 series on television and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Drama series every year from 1981-1986, winning in 1984, but then DYNASTY dropped from #7 to #24 in the ratings during its 1986-87 Season and was ultimately cancelled in the Spring of 1989 after its 9th Season and 8 1/2 year run on ABC, due to a severe decline in ratings.

George Peppard who is known as the brainy on-the-run Vietnam veteran(Col. Hannibal Smith)on THE A-TEAM was originally given the role of Blake Carrington in the Autumn of 1980, but was quickly replaced with John Forsythe since Peppard had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role of patriarch Blake Carrington along with the fact that Forsythe who died in the Spring of 2011 was the only cast member to appear in all 220 episodes of DYNASTY.

Part of what made this show so popular and kept it going strong for so long were the catfights and physical altercations that frequently occured between Alexis & Krystle since Alexis was always interferring in the lives of Krystle & Blake's family and friends along with the fact that DYNASTY was the first TV show to use the word ""Bitch"" on television on top of that.

Additionally, DYNASTY along with the premiere of the police drama T.J. HOOKER in the Spring of 1982 had launched Heather Locklear's acting career and made her a star since Locklear was also doing her role as the sexy Officer Stacey Sheridan on that show at the same time at one time too, but then Locklear had went onto co-starring as the sassy Amanda Woodward on MELROSE PLACE back in 1992 along with the fact that MELROSE PLACE was similar to DYNASTY since it had a lot of steamy sex in it like DYNASTY along with the fact that there was always a lot of humping around on both shows since everybody slept with everybody on MELROSE PLACE having frequent affairs with one another, especially in Amand's apartment complex in L.A. along with the fact that Locklear's Amanda character was quite similar to her Sammy Jo character on top of that as if DYNASTY had inspired the premiere of MELROSE PLACE, which was a spin-off series of BEVERLY HILLS 90210.

The 1981-82 Season of DYNASTY also takes me all the way back to memory lane when this show was part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up starting with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM followed by THE FALL GUY at 9PM, and then topped off with DYNASTY at 10PM, which also takes me back to when Ronald Reagan was president and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1226275200,,4348,4.856950067476383
2214492,3,B0007IO6V4,"I'd only started collecting TV shows on DVD this year.  I realized just about any show is now available in this format, which has been the highlight of '07 for me.  I wondered what show I'd like to have, and Dynasty came to mind.  Imagine my delight when I realized the first season has been released.  However, I didn't buy it yet as I remembered Dynasty started late in its first season, like Dallas, Fantasy Island, Grey's Anatomy, to name some.  I decided to wait until Season 2 is released, to see if 2-packs for both seasons might be available.  You know the rest; someone else here stated it's cheaper and I finally ordered the 2-pack.  They arrived within a week and a half in good condition.  I really appreciate the company for bundling them together; that's what I'd do for every show that starts late if I'm in charge of DVD releases.

Some actors had yet to appear that'd put this series on the map, like Joan Collins and Heather Locklear, to name two.  If Dynasty did fare well at any time in the ratings during the first season, it must've been strictly by an episode or two as the series didn't make the top 25 overall for the season.  Those expecting to see the aforementioned actors here will be disappointed as they didn't arrive until the sophomore season; if good writing is expected or if you'd like to know what started it all that got us Dynasty fans yakking about at the water cooler on Thursdays, then do check this one out.  I'd say it's worth a look.

Actually, I'd never watched Dynasty until its 6th season when I was in college.  Some friends told me how great it was and they kept telling me I should check it out.  I didn't care but decided to give it a try, but sure enough I got hooked.  Wednesday nights became Dynasty nights for me.  One friend told me she's practically dead to the world when it's on--she ignores the phone, the door, etc. everything and everyone that breathes until the closing credits roll.  I  also remember this show being described as larger than life.  Anyway, I'd watch the show for a while until I had to focus some more on my studies, when I'd lost interest in it altogether, or when I noticed the catfights seemed to finally become a thing of the past.  What a time we had to enjoy the beauties that defined devastatingly wealthy excess for us.

I'd already finished watching Season 1.  I had mixed feelings about this one at first given its early storylines but told myself to hang in there until the hiss-worthy Alexis finally charms her way into our DVD players, to put it somewhat questionably.  It's been a wait but worth it.  Enjoy...",1190937600,3,2605,4.468220338983051
2214493,4,B0007IO6V4,"Before this past month, I had seen ""Dynasty"" only once: at the age of 9 in September of 1981 when I was in the hospital recovering from an appendectomy.  It was the rebroadcast of the episode when Blake attacks Steven's ex, Ted.  While watching the episode on DVD, I was surprised at how much of it I remembered and was also struck by how seminal that episode ended up being.

There are some slow moments in the first season, notably in the early episodes.  Once Fallon marries Jeff, things start to take off.  The cast is good.  I had reservations about Pamela Sue Martin at first, but she won me over as Fallon.  Martin has a wonderful command of Fallon and her scenes with Al Corley as her brother Steve are well done.  John James as Jeff Colby seems to be having a great time and his eyebrows are as demonstrative as the rest of him.  I'm surprised at how unsympathetic the character of Blake is, but he's counterbalanced by the radiant Linda Evans as Krystle.

The first season of ""Dynasty"" was a show trying to find its legs.  After this season, major characters were written out and the show felt less like a Denver version of ""Dallas."". Joan Collins was brought in and the oil rig story was phased out entirely though thankfully Pamela Bellwood was retained as Claudia.  The show's ratings rose and it became must watch TV for many on Wednesday nights, so many may be surprised by the first season's different pace and tone.

I'm struck by how excellent the picture quality is of this DVD.  There's barely an imperfect frame. These episodes could have been broadcast yesterday for all the age they show.  Also, don't be fooled by the teaser photo of Alexis on the box; she appears in the last 30 seconds of the final episode.",1187568000,3,1733,4.509615384615385

One of the best things in this first batch of episodes is Lloyd Bochner, in recurring appearances as Cecil Colby.  There's nothing like a hissable-yet-human villain, and Bochner is easily one of the best actors in the cast, perhaps the only one of the same caliber as the incomparable Pamela Sue Martin.

There are a lot of not-so-great moments as well, but it remains surprisingly watchable.  It's dated, but its underlying themes are timeless.",1167868800,3,669,4.884955752212389

Initially this season is a little boring (because we're desparately waiting Joan Collins' arrival), but after the first couple of episodes, you'll probably be hooked.  It's got a trashy storyline (all soaps do), but that's what makes it so good.  For some reason, soaps hook you in and this is no exception.  In a mini nutshell, it's about the wealthy and the real working class trying to merge lives.  Blake marries Krystal who finds it hard trying to fit into this new lifestyle.  Not everyone is happy with her (Blakes daughter for one) and it tells the story of his 'corupt' company and the people he steps on to get to the top.  It's great.

If there is one fault about the dvd that I don't like, it's that there is only two episodes per dvd and it's a pain in the you-know-where to have to keep getting up to change it over (when you're in a hurry to catch the next episode).  Anyway, other than that, I love this show.  It's probably a little tamer than future seasons because the cat fighting has hardly begun, but the juicy story lines have already begun to form, and I can't wait for them to release the other seasons real soon.

The show is the epitome of good living in the 80's and the drama is classic.  The conflicts and surprise twists make for great TV as well.  For anyone who is interested, the reason whys eason 2 is taking so long to come out is because for the past year, Fox has been in the process of selling the rights to the show to Paramount.

2214515,4,B0007IO6V4,"When TV producer Aaron Spelling found a network for ""Dynasty"" in 1981, the inside joke was that ABC spelled Aaron's Broadcasting Company. Little wonder, given Spelling's dominance of the network in the 70's (""Love Boat,"" ""Fantasy Island,"" ""Charlie's Angels""). It is little surprise, then, that ABC challenged CBS' own dynasty of prime time soaps (""Dallas,"" ""Falcon Crest"" and ""Knot's Landing) with this series, originally dubbed - uninspiringly - ""Oil."" Mercifully retitled ""Dynasty,"" cast as Denver oil baron Blake Carrington, John Forsythe finally got to be seen after five years as the faceless Charlie of ""Angels"" fame. Throw in his pending marriage to a former secretary, Krystle Jennings, idelibly Linda Evans' most recognizable personna, and throw in a couple of his kids, spoiled and pampered Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) and openly gay son (Al Corley) Steven (open, but not flaming), an arch-nemisis (Cecil Colby) running a competing oil company - and don't forget the millions and billions of bucks that everyone seems to have - and you've got the groundwork for a mega-hit series that lasted nine years. In this, ""Dynasty's"" freshman season, we learn that scads of power and wealth don't spare its privileged few from some of the same stuff that hits the not-so-powerful and less-than-wealthy, like Blake pushing daughter Fallon into marrying the son of his corporate arch-enemy and her predictable shove-it response, Steven pining over his fractured relationship with Big Daddy Blake after Papa catches Junior in a gay affair. And Krystle? The heart-of-gold (with locks to match) bombshell whose beauty is the Titanic's iceberg has to fret about her transition from working girl and vaulting up a social ladder she fears is too high for her. And she also has to soothe her former lover (Matthew Blaisdel), a geologist for her husband's oil company and who already has his hands full with mentally unhinged wife Claudia. And the season's first cliffhanger gives us Blake on trial for killing his son's gay lover and freeze frames on each central character as the prosecution calls to the stand Blake's long-divorced and long-absent first wife, a veiled and shrouded-in-black Alexis (an omen of seasons to come?). We all know by now that Joan Collins showed up under the veil the next season, but she hadn't been cast for the role and a stand-in used in the first-season wrapup. Some critics here have bemoaned the slow issuance of subsequent seasons because Collins isn't part of the first year. Geez, with Linda Evans, who wants or needs more? Talk about greed!

How much suffering do we have to endure?  How much begging do we need to do to make this happen?  This is TORTURE, and I'm having a breakdown over this.

Bring on Season 3, please.",1145404800,,343,5.017543859649122
2214521,4,B0007IO6V4,"As quite a few reviewers have commented, this DVD set does not include any episodes with Joan Collins, whose casting as the marvellously bitchy Alexis Morell Carrington proved to be the match which lit the flame of this show's popularity.  Most people remember ""Dynasty"" as a good bit of campy, silly, glossy fun - who could forget the huge shoulder pads, the garish sets, or all of those catfights between Alexis and Krystle!  Certainly, revisiting Season One of this beloved program gives you the feeling of watching something which just isn't quite ""right"" - Collins' arrival proved to be the glue which knit the cast and crew together and made ""Dynasty"" a must-see show.  That said, there are many Dynasty fans who actually prefer the first - Alexis-free - season.  Why?  Possibly because Collins' campy presence and over-the-top performance style quickly took the show in a very different, and for many, far less satisfying direction.  Originally, ""Dynasty"" was meant to be a far more realistic and topical program than it eventually became - a show which, unlike its competitor ""Dallas,"" tried to explore very serious issues beneath its glossy melodramatic surface.  Thus, the first season (which was a ratings success but far from the colossal hit the show became in the Alexis years) stands for many as a catalogue of ""might-have-beens.""  For one thing the absence of a strong antagonist/villain at this time made the whole show much more complicated and ambiguous.  Blake Carrington, for example, is in this early period a far from sympathetic man.  John Forsythe plays Blake as ruthless, selfish, arrogant and domineering.  An especially manipulative CEO, Blake treats all others as if they were pawns on a chessboard.  Blake at this period is not the cardboard patriarch he would later become.  In this season, Blake shows little restraint when things do not go his way, and not only winds up killing his son's male lover at the end, but also orders the brutal beating of his daughter's boyfriend and even rapes his own wife in a night of drunken frenzy.  Throughout the season, Blake seems to regard Krystle as his personal possession - a true trophy wife.  He treats his new wife as he treats his children, and it is in fact the conflict between Blake and his offspring which is the heart of this version of the show.  At this period, son Steven (Al Corley) and daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin - the ONLY Fallon) each have major trouble dealing with their father, but for different reasons.  If the producers had had the guts to logically expand on the plotlines they developed in this season, Dynasty would have been a quite different show.  Indeed, the changes made in the characters of Fallon and Steven proved to be so disturbing to the actors playing those parts that both of them eventually left, changing the chemistry of the program and making both characters much less interesting.  In this season, Pamela Sue Martin makes an indelible impression as Fallon Carrington.  Brilliant, spoiled, sensual, free-spirited and tomboyish, Martin gives us a Fallon whose flirtations mannerisms and [...]behavior never compromise her status as a lady.  Fallon - whose business acumen makes her Blake's chosen heir - is also the only person unafraid to tell Blake to go to hell, just as she is his only vulnerable spot.  After Alexis reappeared, the ""bitchy"" qualities displayed by Fallon in the first season were downplayed, making the girl a much more conventional and less independent character, which caused Martin to leave the show suddenly after the second season.  Al Corley - whose brilliant performance as the deeply conflicted yet heroic Steven is the real revelation of this DVD - had the same experience.  Corley accepted the role of the first ""serious"" gay character on a prime-time drama after being told by the producers that Blake's battle with his son over Steven's sexual identity would be the emotional and dramatic crux of the program.  This was a ground-breaking idea and a brave one in 1980 (when the show was actually shot).  Dynasty's best-written scenes in this early period are with Corley.  Kind, generous, highly intelligent, cultured, politically aware and determined to go his own way, Steven is also deeply depressed about his father's rejection of him (he is taking to drink to combat the pain) and is haunted by his hope that his father might someday love him for who he is rather than who Blake thinks he should be.  Corley's performance is quite touching and indeed, heroic, by far the best acting in the entire show.  Corley's expressive face seems to boil with repressed emotion, and the famous ""coming-out"" scene at the end of the pilot episode is a riveting piece of drama, with Blake determined to see Steven's love life as a problem or a sickness, and Steven just as determined to be himself over all objections.  It was a setup rife with real dramatic tension, and the whole thing was discarded in the second season, when Steven went straight and the whole ""gay"" theme dropped for a time.  Like Pamela Sue Martin, Corley was so disgusted by what he saw as a betrayal that he quit the show, forcing the character to be written out for a time.  Of course, if the Steven/Blake conflict were indeed going to be the true dramatic arc of the story, this would have required eventually giving Steven a real boyfriend, and that was not a risk that the producers were willing to take (then or now, just look at Will on ""Will & Grace""!).  Also making a huge mark is the sensitive, deeply touching performance of Pamela Bellwood as the unstable Claudia, who will become Steven's unlikely girlfriend.  I think the one thing which really did not turn out as hoped was the Matthew Blaisdel sub-plot.  Bo Hopkins is handsome but has no screen presence and seems strangely miscast in the role of Blake's antagonistic star geologist.  His leaden and thankless role drags the whole show down, he has no chemistry with the otherwise-charming Linda Evans and it is no wonder the character was written out after the first season!  Also, the direction of the whole thing is much more slow-paced than it would later become.  However, the sets and costumes are much more restrained and less campy here, and in fact the show as a whole seems much more ""real-world"" than it would later be - Blake, Steven and Fallon in particular seem like real people with real problems, not soapy caricatures.  In this season, we see the Dynasty that might have been had the producers not elected to keep it safe and predictable, and had not Joan Collins become such an unexpected bonus.  Required viewing and still compelling after all these years.",1145059200,6,6661,4.865367581930912

2214530,5,B0007IO6V4,"Most when you say soap opera-you think women gossiping. NOT with Dynasty

Dynasty was a class act. King Lear with Oil, instead of land. The land of the Rich, Famous and otherwise. It was Upstair Downstairs for American TV and most of all in the 1980's , it was one of the best!

John Forsyth brought an air of class to the role of Blake Carrington, playing against his so clear, nice guy type image he had played for 30 years since Batchlor Father. Linda Evans was brought out of moth balls to play Krystal, to see this world thru her eyes was eye openning. You must remember first season did not have the talent of Joan Collins (she came to the cast in season two).

Esther and Richard Shapiro created a King Lear for modern TV. A strong father and his two wayward kids. the tart daughter Falon, played to the hilt by Pamela Sue Martin (i wish she would do TV again)and  Steven  the openly Gay son who needs his father's approval when all he gets is belittlement. Al Corley does an amazing job in the role.

on trivia note, George Peppard was fired from the role of Blake after disagreements with the show's producers. If he would have stayed Mr T would not have a foil in the A Team

Is this set, good-YES! it hardly dates itself as a show, the power play is still there and is played out here with a zest most the other 1980's soaps did not have

2214531,5,B0007IO6V4,"Why do we have to wait so long for Season 2?

Obviously, the guys at Fox think that the second season of Dynasty is not going to be popular. How much mistaken they are...

First of all, as everyone has already mentioned, it's the first season that Joan Collins appears (Alexis, hello??) and this fact by itself guarantees that DVD sales are going to be much higher than for Season 1. In addition, I can't help but wonder who was the smart guy who decided to release the first 15 episodes of Season 1 separately from Season's 2 episodes. Weren't you expecting that it would not sell as much as the next seasons? (obviously you guys have never watched the series you had been producing some years ago..) Even Warner released Dallas' first 2 seasons on one DVD set and enjoyed high sales figures.

Anyway, it seems that all Dynasty fans will have to wait for Paramount to take over in November. Let's just hope that they will treat the most addictive TV Soap of the 80s as it deserves - with respect!

And let's just also remind Fox of the following: although Dallas may have been hugely popular in the US, I believe that Dynasty was more popular than Dallas in Europe. However, Fox only released the DVD Set for Zone 1, ignoring all its potential customers in Europe (Zone 2). Pleeease then don't be disappointed with Dynasty's Season 1 DVD Sales - you made a great effort to sabotage the figures yourselves.

A big Dynasty fan from Greece, impatiently awaiting for the Second 2 Dynasty DVD Set release that will prove that there is still a huge audience for Dynasty out there.

2214546,5,B0007IO6V4,"This is by far the best TV on DVD set that I own (and I own many).  The packaging is superior - you can tell Fox didn't just slap this together - it is packaged in beautiful thin cases housed in a very nice cardboard sleeve, WITH an additional sleeve to hold them into place.

The episodes themselves look amazing for a show that is now 25 years old.  The color and picture quality is beautiful.  I'm amazed at the great job they did on this set.  A lot of care was taken in producing this set.

The story itself is much better than I remember.  I used to think that Dynasty didn't really start till Alexis and Sammy Jo arrived.  But on the contrary, the stories here are compelling and heartwrenching.  The acting is superb, especially by actresses such as Pamela Bellwood, Pamela Sue Martin, and Linda Evans.  These three ladies are beautiful and have a talent that surpasses anyone on TV nowadays.  IN particular, the trial scenes in the last two episodes will have you in tears.  Very emotional stuff.

I highly recommend this product to anyone, even for non-fans of this great television triumph.",1127779200,6,1101,4.527918781725888

However, we must insist on the releasing of Season Two and the rest. I have kept on checking fox website for news about the release of the season Two and the rest.  However, I have learned from Fox that they have no plans to release the rest of the seasons for now. I was requested to check back in December 05 for some news.  It would be great if fans could send their request to Fox requesting to release the rest of the seasons.  [...]

Dynasty was and is a great soap opera and we all want to enjoy back again especially all those episodes that Joan Collins is part of.

2214550,5,B0007IO6V4,"I saw this from the beginning in the 80s - but having now watched the DVD set of the first season again in the opulent packaging (wow, that's nice FOX!) : I learned so much that I have forgotten since 1981 - it laid the ground work for the series. I was young then and watched it with family and friends - it personified the 80s 'Reagan years' in the USA - and was far more interesting and glitzy than the rather 'country feel' of ""Dallas"". The writing was more witty and camp in season 2-9 due to Joan Collins - who made ""Dallas"" and it's villain J.R. Ewing look neutered by comparison. A wrath of big name co-stars that came and went over the years to viewer delight - and had the first openly Gay (albiet bi-sexual) character on television. With the real jewels, the furs, the cars, and the extremely expensive clothing from designer Nolan Miller (who was hired to create the ""sparkling real look of wealth"" for ""Dynasty"" series - this was 'the' night time soap that people are finding a liking to today - long before ""The OC"", ""Desperate Housewives"" of today's viewing (although great, not as opulent). Millions spent for one episode, it was escapism at it's best - and although this first season is more drama than glitz, when seasons 2-9 (plus the reunion from 1991 to end the series) come out - you'll be prepared for the most exquisite and entertaining show ever aired on network television. Now : come on FOX - give us seasons 2-9!!!

2214557,3,B0007IO6V4,"Dynasty is kind of a guilty pleasure for me. I got hooked on it when the show was in late-night syndication here in Canada in the late 80s/early 90s.

Since I never watched it during its original run I guess I never saw the first season episodes included in this set before, and so I was quite shocked and disappointed to find that my favourite element of the show and my whole reason for buying this set -- the delectable Joan Collins chewing up the scenery as deliciously nasty Alexis -- is completely absent from the first season episodes!

Yes the episodes in this set do give me a lot more background on various characters and storylines, but without Alexis the show really lacks that extra ""something"", and never really seems to rise above the level of your typical soap. So all in all, this set felt more like a prequel to the ""real"" Dynasty, which it looks like only actually got rolling in Season 2.

So hurry up and bring us Season 2, because that's the Dynasty that I really want to see!

As for the DVDs, since Dynasty started its first season as a mid-season replacement series, there are only 13 episodes here. In such a case I think it would have been smarter to include the full Seasons 1 & 2 in one set the way some other shows like ""Moonlighting"" and ""Sliders"" have, but oh well...

The set also includes a nice documentary on the making of the show plus commentaries on certain episodes from series creator Esther Shapiro and actor Al Corley (Steven Carrington).

The 4 discs are packed in a handy space-saving 2 slipcase format. And I loved the package and menu design which features beautifully glittering diamonds, capturing perfectly the spirit of decadent opulence which permeates the show.

All in all a nice little package, but I still need my Season 2 with Joan Collins. Come on Fox, get moving!",1122681600,51,1822,4.553516819571866
2214558,3,B0007IO6V4,"Dynasty is probably my favourite TV show, bar none.

Who could ever forget such lines as ""Pastels!??"", or ""I would like to remind you that I do have a name. And that is my name "". Both Joan Collins, by-the-by. And since La Collins isn't in this series at all (the walk-on, nonspeaking role of Alexis at the very end of the very last episode is played by a different actress), it falls far, far short of the mark set by later seasons.

Dynasty's not about finely-acted drama, beautifully-directed scenes or Pulitzer-worthy dialogue. What is was about, was Excess. The most satisfying part of the whole show was watching the dual apsects of Crime and Retribution played out against a backdrop of oil-stained Money, and this is a key element that, sadly, Season One lacks in spades.

Instead of the glamorous and preposterous situations of UFO Abductions, Plastic Surgery altering more than just an outward appearance, and catfights where sequins are literally used as projectiles, we have to put up with interminable scene after interminable scene of Steven Carrington (TV's least likeable gay man since Coco the Golden Girls' Cook - remember him?? Thought not :-) and his Whiney Angst, Crazy Claudia and her Looney Angst, sappy Michael Blaisdale and his Lovetorn Angst, and a Krystle Carrington that Linda Evans must have really loathed playing - she looks like she couldn't possibly have been more bored!!

The final four episodes show the inklings of the beginning of Dynasty as we knew and loved it - glitzy murders, divided loyalties, and Krystle in a very faithful pastiche to Faye Dunaway's Pepsi-Cola boardroom sequence from Mommie Dearest - but the rest of the episodes, for me, focus far too much on the cotton (Blaisdale, Michael the Wicked Chauffeur, whiney angsty boring Steven) and not enough on the silk (Fallon, and... uh... Fallon?).

Unless you're a huge completist, don't bother. I do hope Season 2 (and Alexis!!) comes along shortly, to restore my faith in Trashy Excess...",1122249600,2,1991,4.949101796407185

2214561,1,B0007IO6V4,"One couldn't wait for the 70s to end, what with years of television that gave us Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Happy Days, Maude, etc... Bad shows that spun off more bad shows full of schlock and contrived, over the top acting. And what came to our rescue? Dynasty, Dallas, and their spin-offs, schlock, and perhaps the worst (yet rewarded with Emmys) acting perhaps in the history of television. For that alone, I'd recommend buying ""Dynasty"", if only because it could be put in a time capsule for future generations to laugh at what fascinated TV viewers so much in the 80s. As if bad music wasn't enough to be ashamed of in that decade, we were given soap operas in TV's prime time slots, and the acting that has come to be expected in such programs. The fact that anyone was even nominated for acting in a show as dreadful as this is an indictment on awards shows themselves. Fact is, this was a show that got what it asked for- lots of females talking about it the next day at work as if they were talking about real people in their lives, their fashions, their affairs, their wretched lifestyles that were justified by the flaunting of their wealth, the pretty faces (men and women) and the fantasies and affairs to go with them. And yes, we got more spin-offs. Dynasty had some of the most contrived, predictable, cliched writing, and some of the worst acting in TV history. Linda Evans should have been banned from the screen actors guild. Mr. Forsythe himself was better off at being just a voice on a TV show. Bo Hopkins disgraces himself and his history of some great character acting roles in some great movies (""Wild Bunch/ Culpepper Cattle Company"") by being associated with this drek, and for laughing all the way to the bank by merely doing a hybrid impersonation of James Dean and Marlon Brando. And Pamela Sue Martin, if it wasn't for her sex appeal and fashion statements (as can be said for most of the cast), she'd never have acted after ""The Poseidon Adventure."" But I suppose she too epitomizes the show in one respect. There was at least one character that would draw a target audience the producers wanted to reach- in my case I lusted for Martin. That made me a viewer for several epiodes a year, enough to give an informed, objective opinion on this show- garbage! Only those who cling to the past would cling to this show. For them, this show is a bargain. To be fair, it is luscious in it's digital remastering, and all the glitz, glamour and fashion comes across in it better than when originally aired. But also coming across as clearly is the pretentious personna, the incredibly simplified story lines of a complicated business world, and what in hindsight even some of the most dedicated fans has to admit is some dreadful fashions, which was one of the shows drawing cards. The only people who will buy this DVD set is those who watched this show in the first place. No viewer with a taste for quality television will watch this without laughing at it. It's no coincidence that the mid to late 70s, to the mid to late 80s was the time period I watched the least amount of TV in my entire life- news, sports and real events aside (not to be confused with ""reality TV""). At least the 70s had some ground breaking programming to help offset the [...]. What helped salvage the 80s? The Cosby Show? That's another argument for another day. In general, there's a reason the networks are losing so many viewers to cable and sattelite TV: Quality television has been on a downward spiral since the mid-70s and has only devolved at an exponential rate. Shows like ""Dynasty"" only greased the slope.",1121644800,3,3620,4.570769230769231

2214563,5,B0007IO6V4,"This is truly a treat. While I found the start of Season One to be a slow start, I soon found myself very interested in the storylines as the episodes progressed. DYNASTY was a wonderful show and I can't wait for more seasons to be released! In Season One we meet Krystal and Blake, who get married. Krystal used to be Blake's secretary and is unaccustomed to the rich lifestyle. His daughter Fallon doesn't like Krystal at all and uses any opportunity to show this. She marries Jeff to make a business deal. Matthew is a hard working man who is reunited with his wife Claudia who was in a mental institution. She slowly starts to adapt to life again, and repairing her relationship with Matthew and her daughter. We also focus on Steven, Blake's son who is a homosexual. He struggles with it, and it was very accurately portrayed in my opinion. His on and off again boyfriend Ted visits a few times. He has an affair with Matthew's wife Claudia. Blake finds out that Steven and Ted are together saying goodbye, and goes to do something about it. He gets in a scuffle with Ted and pushes him. Ted falls down and hits his head and dies, and Blake goes on trial for murder. It is then when Steven and Claudia's affair is revealed and Matthew attacks Blake, and is arrested. Claudia flees with her daughter and they are in a car accident, Matthew finds out and asks to be released from jail to see them. Also, Blake's ex-wife Alexis shows up. The role that Joan Collins would begin playing in Season 2.

It was definately a drama filled, action packed season. Although, many of the characters would not return in the second season. Matthew and Claudia's daughter would not be seen after the car crash. In season 2, Matthew flees with his daughter and only Matthew returns in one of the later seasons.

Overall a great DVD and it makes me excited to buy the other seasons when they are released!",1119398400,6,1891,4.494186046511628
2214564,3,B0007IO6V4,"In 1981, Dynasty was released to rival Dallas.  John Forsythe's character of Blake Carrington was intended to be as mean and cruel as JR. Rewatching Season 1 recently, Blake certainly showed this cruel side and it was interesting to see how the show began ie. Krystle's wedding day etc.  Fallon was intended to be the villianess of the show to match the likes of Lucy Ewing, Pamela or even Sue Ellen Elling. I found Season 1 of Dynasty rather dull overall, the storylines were lacking in spark, and the characters just didn't really work. Alot of emphasis was placed on Matthew Blaisdale (Bo Hooper) who's character was not included in Season 2 onwards.  His wife Claudia also received considerable exposure in Season 1 and it seemed that these two characters were intended to be a big part of the show.  Well, no. There is one particular good point about Season 1 - the way they dealt with Stephen's sexuality was quite well handled for the time.  As shown in the special features, very few TV shows back then approached this subject for fear of censorship.

Overall Dynasty Season 1 didn't do well in the ratings back in 1981, so it was spiced up for Season 2. Enter Joan Collins who played Blake's first wife Alexis.  This is the when the show really took off.  Joan added the much needed spark and the show's ratings soared.

DVD SUMMARY:

Season 1 DVD is only 13 episodes so it is not very good value for money when compared with the Dallas Pilot/Season 1 DVD which boasts 26 episodes total for around the same price.  A suggestion then would have been to include Dynasty Season 2 on the same set as Season 1. Afterall, isn't that what we are all really waiting for?

Bring on the cat-fights with Krystle and Alexis now.  I will be first in line with my order.",1119398400,5,1765,4.529968454258675

2214566,5,B0007IO6V4,"Interesting to see how the first season began as a ""Dallas"" type clone and evolved into the camp classic hit became to be. I watched this from the begining but that was years ago, so this was interesting the rewatch. I was a tad bummed that the 2nd season wasn't released at the same time, as that is when Joan Collins, joined and the show kicked-off into high gear and never looked back. Also past the first season was the star making debut of screen siren, Heather Locklear. This series is where ""Melrose Place"" got it's roots. And this is the show that obviously got it's cue from the early 70's Spelling horror/soapy camp-fest television movie, ""Home for the holidays,"" starring Jill Haworth and Sally Field. One thing's for certain though, Pamela Sue Martin was the best Fallon Carrington. She really was commiting career suicide when she left this show to pursue an ill-fated movie career.(Where is she now??) And Al Corley was clearly the best Stephen Carrington(kicked off the show for pushing the producers to stand behind gay issues of his character). John Forsythe proved he was more than just a speakerbox voice on ""Charlie's Angeles,"" and Linda Evans was simply beautiful and excellent here.

I will admit that The Show didn't hit its stride until the second season when the Character of Alexis was  Introduced BUT The First Season of Dynasty was Still Excellent featuring Srong Writing and Acting! What the First season lacks in Alexis is almost made up by the Delicious and Mischivious Fallon(Played Beautifully By pamela sue martin). fans of the series who didn't watch the first Season would be surprised to know that Blake Carrington(John Forthyte who is perfect for the role) was  actually not that nice of a guy , had a darker side and you can tell that the producers were trying to make him as a JR ewing typr character(you will be happy to know though that blake mellows out in season 2). Krystle(Linda Evans who must be the most beautiful woman in the world) starts out overwhelmed by her sudden life change from secretary to Lady of The Manor and  it is fun to take this journey with her Dynasty was Considered Bold and Brave when they introduced Steven Carrington, son of blake(a sensitive portrayal by Al Corely) as a homosexual, the first openly gay main character in a prime time drama. Al corely  is to be commended for two reasons,, #1 that he took the part when most actors wouldnt, and #2 he portrayed steven as a Gay man but without the swishy steroetypes. What I enjoyed about the first season was the contrasting lifestyles between the Carringtons and the Blaisdales(matthew, claudia and lindsey) and it was intriguing to watch there lives entertwine. I don't want to get into any plot details as not to give anything away, but the first season, even without Alexis was Excellent and should be looked at.

2214570,4,B0007IO6V4,"Season 1 of ""Dynasty"" may have lacked Alexis, but later it lacked Krystle (even when she was there). The first season gives you a rich, textured introduction to the Carrington saga and its wealthy but often-empty world, with brutal tycoon Blake (John Forsythe) mistreating his sensitive-but-strong wife, Krystle (then beautifully played by Linda Evans). Season 2, with the arrival of wicked ex-wife Alexis (Joan Collins), is great fun as well, albeit of a somewhat different sort, and the glitz increases.

Unfortunately, Krystle did eventually become a wimp: Evans' performance becomes unrecognizable a few seasons into the show, as (and perhaps because) the stories gradually begin to fall apart, with one-plot-after-another-after-another that just went nowhere, the catty dialogue and flashy wardrobe becoming all that remained to sustain the viewer for several years--- or to distract us from what was really happening. (The series' quality only recovering for its final year, season 9, ironically just before it was cancelled).

But seasons 1 and 2 are quite good; I only wish ""Dynasty"" had stayed on-track after this.

(Technical details: Pretty good visual transfer, though a dirty, scratchy copy of the opening theme is used repeatedly; the sound quality is a bit flat and tinny, without much resonance--- curiously, the French dubbed version on this DVD had much richer sound in terms of music and effects).",1116201600,4,1416,5.36936936936937
2214571,5,B0007IO6V4,"Are general briefs of the entire season necessary? This show came to be known as a soap, but the first season is more like a drama. Yeah, it's devoid of catfights, of the B-word being tossed around, of Joan Collins (Alexis Morrel Carrington Colby Raun) scheming to get back at Blake for throwing her out of his mansion and lifestyle ... BUT ... this season is great and shows that this was more than just a flash in the pan. The creators of the show, Esther and Richard Shapiro, set out to tell a story of society as it was, and as it still is.

Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) is an oil tycoon. He's preparing to marry his former secretary, Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans). She's still in love with Matthew Blaisdale (Bo Hopkins), whom she had an affair with while his wife, Claudia (Bellwood) was in a mental institution. The wedding brings together the family and exposes it's many flaws. Blake's daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) is jelous, wanting her father all to herself. She gets involved with Cecil Colby, who'll help her father out if she marries his nephew, Jeff (John James). Then there's the Carrington rebel son Steven (Al Corley), who's struggling with his sexuality and his place in the world.

Everyone can find something to relate to in ""Dynasty."" Whether it's a dysfunctional family, issues of sexuality, or class struggles, there's a lot said in this series that simply caught me by surprise. The actors are all high class. The first season is different from all the other seasons. Yes, it's shorter, with only 13 episodes which clock in at 15 hours worth, but it's high quality story-telling and acting. Forsythe makes you hate Blake for how hard he is on Krystle and how demanding he is of Steven. Steven puts a new face on a bisexual male, one that today's t.v. really wouldn't handle.

The first episode was rather epic and was originally shown on ABC as a 3-hour event. As for the transfer to DVD, I thought it was rather good. I've heard complaints, but considering it was filmed in 1981, I think it's good. The story lines and acting are nothing like the rest of the series. Linda Evans plays a Krystle who isn't comfortable with wealth and she isn't comfortable with being Blake's lap-dog. Forsythe's Blake is hard-nosed and aged, hateful and angry and unable to manage his family while his business ventures take-off. Another breakout star is Bellwood, who plays a fragile Claudia Blaisdale. Her scenes with her on-screen daughter and others really help you to relate the all the wealth and glamour. Another great actor, Pamela Sue Martin, who plays the jealous daughter. She's witty, independent, and knows how to get to people.

I'd definately recommend that people listen to the commentary. I was disapointed with some of the commentary that went into the Dallas Season 1 and 2 set. Yet, Esther Shapiro really puts in a great effort by explaining everything in the three episodes which commentary is available. She'll explain the coming of Joan Collins, why they decided to spend so much time on Steven's sexuality, why this season was different from all the others. She puts the show in the context of the '80s, saying that they wanted to do a show about the wealthy but they wanted to tell it somewhat from the perspective of the ordinary man. Surprisingly, she also compares a lot of the scenes and characters to that of Dallas, which Dynasty was in constant competition with.

As for other bonus features, Al Corley (Steven), does commentary with Esther Shapiro for two episodes near the end of the season. He too is great to listen to. They don't just sit there and say, ""oh, look, there I am. I remember liking that scene."" He comments on how he was frustrated with Steven always being unsure of his sexuality, on the secrets behind little scenes such as the big trial, on what it was like behind the stage. ""Family, Furs and Fun: Creating DYNASTY"" isn't really a series overview as the box claims. It talks about the creation of the series and the characters. It's short but informative. Richard Shapiro speaks more here than his wife Esther. Fallon and Steven are profiled in ""Dynasty's Daughter"" and ""Prodigal Son."" I would ave liked it if it would have gotten the opinions of the actors who took over the roles in the later seasons, just to get an idea of how these characters changed. BUT, the great thing is that these segements contained candid interviews from Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley as they are today. So they've had time to reflect on their experiences and their roles and they don't really hold back. Both are about five minutes each. Pamela Sue Martin goes into Fallon's character and the decision she made to leave the show.

This was such a great season and show that I'd recommend it to all. It's relevant to today because here we are, nearly two decades after the show first aired, still dealing with homosexuality, oil, wealth, greed, just as the characters in the show are. Birth control, drugs, sex ... that's all a part of this season as well and highly interesting. ""Dynasty"" is a timeless show that perhaps was derailed after Joan Collins stepped in and spiced things up, but definately should be included in your DVD collection.",1116028800,7,5200,4.72136563876652
2214572,4,B0007IO6V4,"I have been checking repeatedly for the release of this tv show which was one of my favorites in the 80's and I was excited when I heard about it's release.  I've been having fun watching these episodes again, especially since in childhood, I had the B&W tv and can now enjoy the episodes again and in color.  The acting was good, the scripts were well written for prime time soap material, and some of the aerial shots of the forests and such were breathtaking.

My only complaint is for such a show where true fans loved seeing how the characters dressed as much as what was going on and such, the packaging was very limited in its presentation.  It seems nowdays, the cheaper way to package is to sandwich episodes on either side of a disc.  Sure, it's more convenient, doesn't take as much time to sort through episodes and putting in discs, but the black interior casings, disc cover repeats of what's on the front cover, and small pics lining the back of the casings just doesn't do the show justice.

I'm hoping as given the long time frame between Dallas seasons 1-2 & 3, that we won't have to wait long for Season 2 of Dynasty and when it does come out, atleast add some more pictures and make the packaging a bit more enticing!

Aside from that, I'm another Dynasty fan sooo glad it's now out on DVD!",1115942400,4,1310,4.3884297520661155

Now that both are on DVD, I have decided to branch out and give 'Dynasty' a try. What a treat! They just do not make evening soaps the way that they did in the 80's. This is pure, complete fun recommended to anyone who has enjoyed other 80's soaps but has not yet seen this one.

It gave us all something to look forward to on Thursday nights. As for this season 1 release not being complete, i believe that it is. The part where Cecil Colby and Fallon make a deal is in this set. Remember the dvd are double sided. But i hope that Fox releases season 2 soon so we can start to enjoy Alexis.

2214575,5,B0007IO6V4,"This DVD set is interesting because it includes the 1st season of DYNASTY which was radically different from what the show became after its initial year.  This season is split between ultra-rich oil tycoon Blake Carrington as he marries Krystle and decidedly middle class Matthew and Claudia Blaisdale as they struggle to put their life back together.  It was meant to be an update of UPSTAIRS,DOWNSTAIRS with the common Blaisdales contrasting the opulence of the Carringtons.  It has a lot of grit, and shows the inner workings of an oil rig -- all things that were left out once Alexis showed up in the second season and they decided to all stay in the mansion (because the network thought that would garner it higher ratings).

This is how the creators originally envisioned the show.  It shows you the origins of many of your favorites - Blake, Krystle, Fallon, Steven, and Claudia are all very prominent in this season.  The DVDs are well done with about 5 hours of commentary from Esther Shapiro (a co-creator) and actor Al Corley (Steven Carrington).  The features include interviews with both Al Corley and Pamela Sue Martin (Fallon).  You get to see how they look today, and what they thought about playing on the show in this first season.  These stories were grounded and realistic when contrasted with all the crazy things that happened later on during the 8 year DYNASTY run.  There is no Joan Collins here (they used a body double - the wife of one of the editors for the climactic reveal of Alexis in the finale), so don't let the box cover fool you.  But you do get some solid acting and some great stories.",1115337600,6,1623,4.679577464788732

2214579,5,B0007IO6V4,"While the show didn't get REALLY fun and entertaining until Joan Collins came in as Alexis, season 1 was by no means a dull season.  It provided very good episodes for us to get to know each character and get invested in their lives and lifestyle.  Pamela Sue Martin's portrayal as Fallon makes her the best character of the first season, her witty remarks mixed with her snotty attitude you can't help but love her.  The least liked character to me is Krystle, through out the series run she was never a character I could get myself to care about.  In the later seasons I was always rooting for Alexis to destroy Krystle (that's probably why Alexis was my favorite character).  John Forsythe portrays Blake with perfection during this season as a strong and powerful man.  Al Corly is okay as Stephen although I think Jack Coleman portrayed the character better in the later years.  Over all the first season is a must for Dynasty fans and the first season cliff-hanger with Alexis walking in is the biggest highlight for we all know that once Alexis came in, the cat fights soon followed.",1114905600,3,1090,4.616580310880829

One often speculated on what was worse--some of the acting or most of the writing? For me, there were only 3 actors on the show who were truly interesting--Pamela Sue Martin, Lloyd Bochner and Lee Bergere.  After the first year is when they should have created the Colby spinoff...with Bochner in the lead role as Cecil Colby...with Fallon as his wife, newly stolen away from his boring nephew...and with their majordomo, Joseph, newly stolen away from Blake Carrington! :) Oh wait, and they should have taken Peter Mark Richman with them, too!  I'd add Katy Kurtzman also, except Katy Kurtzman--who was one of the best child TV actresses of her time--did not belong on a show like Dynasty.  No child did.

So yes, you won't get as of yet the Krystle-Alexis catfights, Sammie Jo's and Adam's evil scheming, Diahann Carroll's wonderful Dominique Deveraux, or even Joan Collins in all her splendor...Season One is really a warm up. However, there is some solid entertainment here: good writing, solid performances (especially by Al Corley and the always-lovely Pamela Sue Martin), and some nice attention to detail. As other reviewers have mentioned, enough cannot be said about how great Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon is to the show; sexy, vibrant, sarcastic, and adorable, she adds a real touch of class to the show (something the ""later"" Fallon, Emma Samms, never achieved). Basically Season One is essential viewing for soap fans and especially the Dynasty fans who are anticipating later season releases with all the juicy catfights and the one and only Alexis.",1114560000,3,993,5.2125

Fox have produced a lovely package with the 4 discs housed in two very slim hard plastic cases which fit into an outer slip case.

The picture quality on the episodes is very good with excellent detail, it actually looks better than when it was broadcast in the UK. There are some flecks and dirt on the opening credits but nothing to get too upset about, the main episode footage is very clean. The image is very stable with no video noise or smearing. It's quite a shock how good it looks on dvd. The mono sound is very good allowing the theme tune and dialogue to come through loud and clear.

This has only made the wait for season two even more unbearable. Fox have produced a great season 1 set. Bring on season 2 and Alexis !!!

Another reviewer mentioned that there were no cell phones to be seen, but, indeed there were...and they were the size of a man's shoe!

2214589,5,B0007IO6V4,"Yeah I was a DYNASTY nut. It just kinda defined the 80's for me - and drove my exasperated parents to mental exhaustion. Born in 1970 I grew up in a house and with parents who definitely (and thankfully) did not buy into any form of materialism - so naturally my teenage rebellion - in true Alex P. Keaton style - consisted of total devotion to Lacoste/Izod clothing, Rolls-Royce & Ferrari automobiles and door-wide shoulder-padded Hugo Boss blazers. And religious DYNASTY patronage. Those nutty 80's ... hehe.

I'm a writer/producer today and creatively I have to say that this first season of DYNASTY might be a big, pleasant surprise to those who remember the show only as campy glitz. The writing is really top-notch and the acting matches it perfectly - Pamela Sue Martin's Fallon steals the entire show. She is amazing - I was totally in love with her back then. And you completely fall in love with her all over again - spoiled, witty, catty but with a true (if confused) heart of gold. TV characters don't come any classier than this. Al Corley is cute as heck as Steven. Very James Deansy and vulnerable. One forgets that the whole gay subplot was sensationally daring for its time. The chemistry between Fallon and Steven is great - so much love permeates their scenes together. It really is surprisingly touching.

DYNASTY was never about plot (most of them were pretty sloppy) - the show was about beautiful people in beautiful clothes living in beautiful houses doing ugly things to each other. It worked for most of the run - but the first three seasons really kicked butt. When Pamela Sue martin left after Season 3 it went downhill, I think. Too much camp ensued - though to me, admittedly, the entire run is a guilty pleasure.

An important note: Alexis only enters from season 2 - so don't look for her in this package. However, don't despair, there is plenty of drama and fun to be had still - arguably this first season cold be the best from an acting stand point. The writing is certainly some of the best in the entire series.

The DVD package is great. Picture looks crisp and the sound is good - the extras include recently taped interviews with Richard & Esther Shapiro, Pamela Sue Martin (who at 53 is still a knock-out in a natural, non-plasticized way. Wild) and Al Corley who also looks good. Esther Shapiro makes talky, enlightning and intelligent commentary on four of the episodes and is joined by a very pleasant, down-to-earth Al Corley on two of them. From the commentary it can be derived that there is still a lot of love and respect between the original actors on the show - they apparently still hang out and reminisce.

I'm hoping that the extras don't end here and that many more goodies will be included on the DVD releases of the other seasons.

Here is what I would like to see:

* Life during DYNASTY - what was it like?

* Where are they now? I want to know what Pam Sue, Al Corley et al. did after the show. What was life like after DYNASTY?

*Outtakes, bloopers, screentests etc. - and I'd like to see the discarded footage of George Peppard as Blake Carrington before he was replaced by John Forsythe. And, yeah, we all want to see the cast members ""corpse"" during a really serious scene, don't we? Bloopers wanted! :-)

* More present-day interviews with cast and crew members (Collins, Evans, Nolan Miller, Spelling, Forsythe, Locklear etc etc.)

* The fashions of DYNASTY - interview with cozzie designer Nolan Miller

The extras on the first season do seem a bit sparse, but maybe they're holding on to some of it for future releases. I definitely hope to see Linda Evans, Joan Collins etc. in interviews and hear them on commentary tracks. Also, the character profiles tend to be cut so that actual clips from the show get more screen time that close ups of the actors being interviewed - this I don't like. I want to see more of them as they look today. That's the fun part.

Anyway, I must be a real nutcase spending so much time writing up this review, but there it is, hehe.

I hope Season 2 hit stores soon - I'll put on my best power suit and count the minutes to the release date on my Rolex :-).",1113696000,15,4157,4.5179760319573905

2214591,5,B0007IO6V4,"I am very excited to see Dynasty released on DVD.  I NEVER was a Dallas fan.  Dynasty was simply the greatest nighttime soap ever!  Outstanding picture quality.  Great extras.  Loved the commentaries and new interviews with the REAL Steven and Fallon.  I would have liked to have seen included the teasers at the end/beginning of each episode as when it originally aired (""Next/Last Time, on Dynasty"").  The first season starts slow, and picks up when Alexis arrives in season 2.  But, there are plenty of reasons that this season is a must have.  There was a true sense of heartfelt honesty in Al Corley's performance as he embodies the character of Steven, and it only goes to show what a brilliant actor he is.  Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley in my opinion always gave standout performances and are the reason I love this show.  While I THOUGHT that I learned in time to come to terms with and accept their replacements (I came to enjoy Jack Coleman in later seasons, though I always preferred Al Corley), when I watch these episodes again, it is clear to me that there is only ONE actress who could ever portray Fallon Carrington, and she was NOT Emma Samms.  While I'm sure Ms. Samms is a great actress in her own right, she will NEVER be Fallon for me.  Never!  Case in point, Fallon despised Sammy Jo at all times, but near the end of the series when the characters got in a fight that turned out to be a mud slinging event, they eventually laughed and made up.  Are you KIDDING ME?  Fallon hated Sammy Jo.  This scene could have NEVER happened if they hadn't ruined the character of Fallon.  What an injustice the producers and everyone involved did to the die hard fans in casting an actress so night-and-day different than Pamela Sue to portray one of the most popular characters in the series.  What a huge mistake.  Why Why Why?  She did not look the same (hello?!), she did not act the same (the fake Fallon acted like she was constantly a victim, crying and feeling sorry for herself, unlike the carefree, lovable, scheming vixen the REAL Fallon was), and she did not SOUND the same (they never bothered to explain how she mysteriously picked up an English accent).  As far as I'm concerned, it was a totally different character altogether (same thing when they replaced Catherine Oxenberg's Amanda with that no name, but the sting from the Fallon substitute was FAR worse).  It's no wonder why The Colby's never really caught on.  Viewers just can't accept a Fallon replacement, no matter who it is.  Pamela Sue Martin's Fallon was the spark that drove the first season from start to finish, right up to her final episode.  You can't deny, she stole every scene she was in!!  As far as I'm concerned, when she left the show, the show officially died.  In time maybe I'll be able to come to terms with the fact that they ever thought that they could replace her.  And even so, what a very bad choice.  This is unexplainable and unforgivable to me, a true Dynasty fan from the beginning.  One last thing.  Who in the world was in charge of designing the box for this season???  Fallon was totally robbed.  She earned the right to be on the cover with Blake and Krystle, as SHE was the one that provided the conflict that drove the early episodes.  I hope that Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley will participate with even more extras and commentaries in the future (as well as the other stars like Linda Evans, John Forsythe, and John James), because they still have so many fans out here that love them!",1113264000,5,3515,4.534181240063593

2214593,4,B0007IO6V4,"Watching the new box set of 'Dynasty', it's interesting to see how the show started and was designed.  Unlike the salacious camp of later seasons, the first season of Dynasty was saucy and playful, but not outright trashy like some of the later seasons.  With themes like homosexuality, anti-Americanism, depression, class struggles, the early Dynasty actuallly tried to be...dare I say it? - intelligent.

The show actually tried to address serious matters yet still deliver solid entertainment.  I also found the characters better written in the early seasons.  Blake was much more mysterious and cunning in the early seasons, and both Al Corley and particularly Pamela Sue Martin (fabulous) were better than their replacements in later seasons.  In fact, I could never imagine anyone else playing Fallon than Emma Samms, but watching Martin, I realize she truly was Fallon.  She was a great nemesis for Krystle before Joan Collins showed up.  Also, the show had incredible set design even from the beginning, and it still looks great today.

Also, I hand it to Fox for their presentation of Dynasty.  The show looks great on DVD, unlike the transfer of Dallas which looked dirty and grainy.  Dynasty looks crisp and sleek, but then what would you expect from a show about the richest of the rich?",1113004800,5,1299,4.995348837209303

In the pilot episode, John Forsythe has some great lines -- and that hair!  What's not to love?  It's hard to imagine that he was actually in his mid-60s at the time.  (It's even more amazing that he's still going strong today, as he approaches 90!)  As for Lynda Evans' portrayal of Krystal, I think she's fabulous!  In fact she's always been my favorite character because throughout she manages to maintain grace and innocence even though she is surrounded by corruption and greed.  And, as demonstrated by her cat fights with Alexis in later seasons, Krystal is NO WIMP.  Suggestions to the contrary are unconvincing.",1110844800,6,881,4.743421052631579

Pity though to neglect Pamela Sue Martin from the front cover. Next to Krystle's clumsy stumblings around the Carrington house - Steven's storyline and Fallon's scheming were crucial to the development of the show. Fallon's sharp barbs alone (delivered with precision and extra relish by the always wonderful Pamela Sue Martin) deserve DVD box credits: (To Krystle regarding prenup) ""It's just like in the Bible - You brought nothing into this world and it is certain you shall take nothing out.""

8047673,4,B0007IO6V4,"I was too young to watch ""Dynasty"" during its original run, and I have never watched the series which some state this show was a rip-off of, ""Dallas"", so I can't really make a comparison there. I started watching ""Dynasty"" when I came across a DVD set for Season 2 on sale and watched it. I loved it but it made me want to see the first season (although I'd heard it wasn't as good, in large part because Joan Collins hadn't joined the cast yet as Alexis Carrington), because I wanted to see how the stories unfolded and how the characters were introduced and developed. I wasn't disappointed. Sure, the show hadn't quite hit its mark yet, but it was still interesting. I really disliked Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) in the beginning, and as I understand it, he was supposed be as unsympathetic as J.R. Ewing, the patriarch of ""Dallas"". He really is arrogant and controlling over his new wife, Krystle (Linda Evans), and over his children, his wildcat, promiscuous daughter Fallon (the fantastic Pamela Sue Martin) and especially his sexually conflicted son, Steven (Al Corley, also wonderful). Steven has just ended a relationship with Ted Dinard (Mark Withers) and his father can't deal with this and demands that Steven ""act like a man"". Steven rebels and goes to work on an oil rig with Blake's enemies, Walter Lankershim (Dale Robertson) and Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins).  Matthew's wife, Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) has recently been released from a mental institution and is trying to return to a normal life, but she is unaware that Matthew was involved with Krystle (prior to her marriage to Blake) while she was locked away. Fallon dislikes her new stepmother, and adores her father and brother, and finds herself attracted to one of her father's business rivals, Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner) who pressures her to marry his nephew, Jeff (John James) in order to help her father. Jeff is a nice guy who is welcomed into the Carrington family, but Fallon treats him with ambivalence, and he is desperately in love with her. To complicate matters further, Fallon has been having an on and off tryst with the chauffeur, Michael Culhane (Wayne Northrop) who has his own ideas about how to use this and his position to his advantage. Claudia and Matthew's daughter Lindsay (Katy Kurtzman) is dealing with teenage issues (she frequently is in tears throughout the entire season, which gets tiresome after a while) and when Claudia senses that Matthew is turning away from her she becomes involved with Steven, who is forced to deal with homophobia at his job and is thrown for a loop when his former lover Ted reappears toward the end of the season, leading to the climax of season 1 that would pick up in Season 2 with the arrival of Alexis. Oh, the drama!

While the first season attempted to show both sides with the wealthy Carringtons and the working-class Blaisdel family and the oil workers, it was decided in Season 2 to focus more on the rich characters and their business rivalries and personal drama, so it's not surprising that Matthew, Lindsay, Michael and Walter were all dropped after Season 1 (although Bo Hopkins and Wayne Northrop would make returns in later seasons). Season 2 is kind of bittersweet as Al Corley departed from the series, disappointed with the writing for his character (he signed on to play the first openly gay character on television and disapproved of the writing, making Steven bisexual), and was ultimately replaced in Season 3 by Jack Coleman, who eventually grew into the character of Steven but it just wasn't the same. Ditto Pamela Sue Martin leaving the show after Season 4 and replaced by Emma Samms, who was miscast, to put it mildly. It was never the same after Corley and Martin left, although Catherine Oxenberg as Amanda was a good replacement for Fallon until that role, too, was recast. ""Dynasty"" was great for the first few years but its downfall was too many recasts, redundant and poorly written storylines and too many long-lost relatives popping out of the woodwork.

Season 1 is important because it shows how the characters evolved and established their relationships. Anyway, I liked it.",1489708800,,4155,4.857545839210156
