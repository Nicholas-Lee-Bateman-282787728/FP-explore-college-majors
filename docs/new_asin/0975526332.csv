7795591,1,0975526332,"This ""clarion call to all Americans who cherish their religious freedom,"" as long as they are fundamentalist, poorly educated, male christians. This book is simply a polemic attack on the most important under-pinnings of the Constitution of the USA, namely the freedom of religion (for everyone, including Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and even Satanists), and the separation of church and state. Quite apart from Mr Moore's record of misogyny and pedophilia, this book shows just how un-American this man is.",1512000000,,502,5.367088607594937

Unfortunately most Americans are apathetic and uninformed or ill-informed. This video is a must see and a call to action for all freedom-loving people to wake up before it is too late. America must return to her foundation in natural law because ""If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?"" Our survival depends upon it. Judge Moore concludes with the warning, ""When your liberty does not come from God it comes from man and if it comes from man they can take it from you""",1121817600,7,659,4.739130434782608
