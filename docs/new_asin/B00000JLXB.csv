Also another powerful ally appears. Little Neese is  very unique and a  nice addition to this episode.",962496000,,266,4.5
7912518,5,B00000JLXB,"This series if intened for those who enjoy fantasy stories or for those who want to forget where they are and enjoy a good story. This episode starts ten years after the battle on fire dragon mountain. Spark has grown  up and is a loyal knight in traing in Flaim. Spark is determined to become  a knight and to serve his king. King Kashue is reunited with Parn and tells  him that there is trouble brewing again. In this volume spark sets off on a  quest to retrevie a stolen item from marmo spies. Spark also teams up with  some new allies and sets off on this new quest. The little bonus show is  now hosted by Neese and Spark, mainly because the focus is now on them and  not Deedlit and Parn. I love How super Deformed Spark and Neese are persued  by a Super deformed evil elf with a lollipop.;)",947116800,,799,4.2105263157894735
7912519,5,B00000JLXB,"I love the new series! The first few episodes were great. Contrary to popular belief, they changed it to make the story richer and stick closer to the manga. It makes a lot more sense this way. The animation is even  better than the original series! I especially love the omaki theatre at the  end of each episode. Watch these and you won't be disappointed!",945734400,,357,4.476923076923077
7912520,4,B00000JLXB,"Overall, I give it a B-.  The story is good, even though it has very little to do with the original Record Of Lodoss War.  The problem with this one?  Bad dub job.  Spend the extra money and get it in subtitled format.",944956800,,218,4.0
7912521,4,B00000JLXB,"The wait for the next video to come out is killing me.  This series has a very strong plot that will keep you watching.  Don't hesitate.  You'll buy these videos and you'll like them, trust me.  And fans of the first series  might not like the contradictions in the first few episodes, but if you've  watched up to this one you won't even care.  Buy them, watch them.  You  won't be disapointed.",943228800,,395,4.375
