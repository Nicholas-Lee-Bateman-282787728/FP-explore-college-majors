8078746,3,B000AL8JK2,"The concert itself is awesome! I have the VHS version and it is still in great condition..Then i saw this DVD on Amazon and wanted it!  The item arrived very fast in great shape..The problem however, is the picture quality..The color is very bad and the picture is grainy! It almost looks foggy on the stage! The tint is awful!  I hope that i just got a bad copy..buyer beware!  **P.s. This was quite expensive also!**",1366416000,,418,4.473684210526316

8078748,5,B000AL8JK2,"If you like Mr. Big then this concert DVD is a must! I have watched this DVD several times and it is like being at the concert and having the best seat in the house!  Billy is as insane as ever, but Paul Gilbert is just amazing. I like to watch concert films while on a treadmill and this DVD seems to be on a regular monthly rotation since I bought it 6 months ago!  It's just a great show!",1152230400,5,391,3.875
