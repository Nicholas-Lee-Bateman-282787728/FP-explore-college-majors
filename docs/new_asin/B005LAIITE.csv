4813355,5,B005LAIITE,"I think these fabulously created movies deserve some type of reward- I mean, the books are excellent, and these movies are well- excellent! Docked one point for the actors growing up.",1353024000,,183,4.935483870967742
4813356,5,B005LAIITE,Took the family to see this movie absolutely great family movie.  My entire family husband and three daughters laughed the entire movie.  Will definitely buy the DVD and watch with family again.,1351382400,2,194,5.03125
4813357,5,B005LAIITE,"My 6 year old grand daughter is a huge fan of the ""Wimpy Kid"" films and I actually don't mind as I find them almost as entertaining as she does.  She has chosen these as her favorites and I have added them to my ipad which means she can be entertained almost anywhere we go together. The movies are funny and entertaining to adults as well as children ... grade school aged children anyway. I am giving this 5 stars as the content of the Wimpy Kid movies is appealing with out being too cheesy. There is no foul language ... and any violence is pretty much slapstick type stuff.  The Wimpy Kid movies are fun family entertainment. I will buy Wimpy Kid(3): Dog Days when it's available.",1349827200,4,685,4.34375
4813358,5,B005LAIITE,GREAT MOVIE!!!! MUST WATCH!!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST!!!!!  i saw this movie the day it got released and i wasn't disappointed.,1348358400,3,129,4.863636363636363
4813359,5,B005LAIITE,"Go ahead, call me immature (though I prefer young at heart), but I really did enjoy this movie.

School is out and there are 73 days of summer vacation.  Greg Heffley imagines the days ahead to be filled with video games in the family living room.  Unfortunately for Greg, his parents have other ideas, urging him to play outside, read literature, and get a summer internship.  That's when Greg has an idea . . . if he tells his parents that he got a job at the local country club, he can spend his days at the country club pool (where the girl he likes, Holly, spends her time) AND make his parents happy.  What could possibly go wrong?

Hilarity ensues and, in the end, Greg must pay the consequences for his deception (which I appreciate because I may be immature, but I am still a parent).

This is a fun film!",1344902400,21,814,4.315789473684211
4813360,5,B005LAIITE,"I have not read these books, but 2 of my 3 kids have (all elementary school age) and they wanted to see this movie. We've seen the other two movies, but I think this was the most entertaining of the three, for both kids and adults. It's summer in this one, the kids are therefore home from school, and more of the drama is family-based than school-based. Greg and his Dad are at odds - Greg wants to play video games all summer, and his Dad wants him to get outdoors. Both think they have little in common, and Greg ends up deceiving his family about a summer job in order to get his Dad off his back. Of course everything comes out in the end, and he learns valuable lessons about honesty, and both he and his Dad learn lessons about acceptance and loyalty. There are MANY laugh-out-loud scenes, including one involving their new dog and a pot roast, another when Greg's older brother Rodrick (who almost steals the movie) is saved from drowning in the pool, and more when Greg and his best friend Rowley ride the 'Cranium Buster' at the boardwalk. All three of my kids enjoyed this movie from start to finish, and I'd highly recommend!",1344816000,33,1137,4.419047619047619
4813361,5,B005LAIITE,"This was fun! I wasn't expecting it.

This was not movie I would choose to go watch.

We only went to see it, because the kids wanted to go to a movie, and this was the only one that was showing that they could go to (all other kids movies that were showing, we had already seen). This was the only one left, for us to go see, at the local theater.

I'm glad it was, and that the kids pressed on.
For me, it was refreshing, for once to watch a great non-animated kids movie. I (and the rest of the family) love animations. Disney/Pixar, DreamWorks etc. So Dairy of a Wimpy Kid, would not be something we would normally go for.

I have to say, I liked it very much. Lots of laughs. Mom, and the kids (7 and 12) liked it too.
Every now and then, I was looking to my right, just to watch our 7 year old luaghing out loud. He had a great time! So did his older sister.",1344384000,41,864,3.92
4813362,5,B005LAIITE,"This is another funny adventure for the entire family, and is the third installment of 'The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid.' Summer has finally arrived and Greg spends it working at a country club. However, trouble is brewing for more than one reason. The themes are mischievous children, sibling relationships, and friendships that are breaking apart. This is a Great summer movie for the entire family! For the adults, it brings back the memories of what it felt like to be a kid. Laugh-out-loud fun, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!",1343952000,9,541,5.022222222222222
4813363,5,B005LAIITE,"This is Julianna Noone reporting for KIDS FIRST! and reviewing the film Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.  This film is the third film in this popular series and is based on the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, which are written by Jeff Kinney.  These books are about the ups and downs of growing up and trying to deal with school, family and relationships.  The stories are so well written and relatable, that you can't help but love the books and the movies.  This film stars Zachary Gordon, who does a great job once again as the main character Greg Heffley, and Robert Capron, as his lovable friend Rowley Jefferson.  This films starts out with Greg and Rowley finishing the school year and planning out their summer vacation.  There's only one problem, as usual for Greg, nothing goes as planned.  Follow along as Greg and Rowley try to make it through the dog days of summer.  My favorite character is Greg because he is funny and means well even when he makes mistakes and deep down, he just wants everyone to like him.  It is hard choosing one scene as my favorite, because most of the scenes at the country club are absolutely hysterical, but I was able to choose one.  That's when Greg's older brother Roderick, played brilliantly by Devon Bostick, tries to fake drowning to the pretty life guard will save him.  The problem is, she doesn't even notice him, so an older, hairy man dives into the pool, pulls him out and performs mouth to mouth on him.  Roderick's facial expression was priceless and this scene is just so funny, I could not stop laughing.  Not only is this movie well written and very funny, but it has a really strong cast that help bring to life the Heffley family and make this an enjoyable film that the entire family can relate too and enjoy.  The movie also has a great message in it about growing up and learning from your mistakes.  Overall, I love this fabulous film and urge you to take your family and go see this film today.  I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars, as I think this is a film your entire family will love as much as I do.  Go see this film, opening in theaters on August 3rd, trust me, you will love it!  This has been Julianna Noone reporting for KIDS FIRST!  And remember, a man who makes no mistakes, is a man who hasn't learned anything.",1343865600,,2284,4.369668246445498

4813425,5,B005LAIITE,"I credit Jeff Kinney with helping to develop my son's love for reading - his books are THAT good. I began by reading the first book to him as was our nightly routine. Before we'd made it all the way through the book, Kiddo was reading it on his own and asking for help only when he couldn't pronounce a word or didn't know the meaning. The storylines and writing style are engaging enough that kids want more and adults don't mind. A+!",1520812800,,435,4.253012048192771

I love all the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies and my kids have read all the books.  If you're looking for non-animal talking movies (I get so tired of those movies where animals talk to each other with human voices) for your kids and that are not scary or has cussing/sex/negative teenage angst (kids snobbing each other and acting ugly), then you should be quite happy with this movie and all the others.",1500940800,,532,4.578947368421052

We enjoyed the first two and managed to get Dog Days, the third in the movie franchise from our public library. I have to admit that even I enjoyed it, just about as much as my daughter did!

The third film follows our beloved wimp, Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) throughout his summer vacation. Greg's dad, Frank (Steve Zahn) thinks Greg needs to spend less time playing video games and more times outdoors, which Greg considers a disastrous proposition. Greg tries various evasive tactics before finally settling on the most reliable, accepting his best friend Rowley's (Robert Capron) invitations to the local country club, which is members only. This also provides Greg the golden opportunity of getting closer to popular girl Holly (Peyton List). When Frank announces that Greg can come work at his company as an unpaid intern for the summer, the desperate Greg lies that he has got a job at the country club. Of course, older brother, the pesky Rodrick (Devon Bostick) sniffs out the truth and blackmails Greg, forcing Greg to sneak Rodrick into the country club each time he goes there with Rowley.

This third installment provides lots of laughter. Though some of the comical situations might seem contrived, they work, and the funny dialogue as well as the excellent acting by the ensemble cast create lots of comedic moments that had me and my daughter laughing out loud throughout the movie. There's one particular scene involving Greg, a little girl, and a diving board that is just too funny, and many more.

The movie also has its poignant moments. Greg and his dad seem to be very different people and just can't seem to find common ground, and the situations in which they are thrown together often result in disaster, but through it all, Frank Heffley bears with his rascal of a son and the resolution is satisfactory to all. This is great family fun and clean too, which is so hard to come by in so-called family entertainment these days. My daughter and I can't wait for the rest of the movies in this series.",1371686400,6,2188,4.7678100263852246

My low rating is because of Amazon's streaming service.  I purchased the HD version of the movie at the higher price.  After completing the purchase, Amazon informs me that it will automatically lower the resolution in order to provide uninterrupted service in the event that there is insufficient bandwidth.  I recognize that the problem is due to the individual subscriber's internet capability, however I believe that Amazon should automatically reduce the purchase price to the NON-HD price when they AUTOMATICALLY reduce the resolution.",1365033600,3,603,5.3936170212765955

The extras are a bit light--deleted scenes and bloopers--and the requisite commentary track. Not a big fan of the cartoon artwork of stick-boy wimpy kid in the one full skit on the extra.",1358467200,,435,4.506329113924051

Finally about halfway through, our screen turned blue and we had to unplug the Roku, because that was the only way to get out of the screen.

4815899,5,B005LAIITE,"This time Greg gets into some trouble on his summer vacation. He spends the first day of summer vacation playing video games as I expect most boys hope to spend their vacation until his father hints at sending him to a strict boys academy.  When his father believes he has found a summer job at a local country club after Greg goes as a guest of Rowley he finds himself caught up in lie after lie.  Rodrick finds out that he is at the country club where his recent crush goes and has Greg sneak him in by threatening to tell his parents that he really doesn't have a job. With the lies mounting, Greg and his father's relationship becomes more strained until they go on a camping trip bonding the two together.

There are many great scenes that will  have kids laughing and parents nodding their heads in agreement. What I love most about this movie besides the funny, sweet, comical side is that kids hopefully come from away with a lesson that lying is not the best policy and being honest with our parents will make your relationship much stronger. When Greg's father says he is disappointed in him, Greg feels it much more than if his father had grounded him. Great family movie with wonderful lessons about always telling the truth and being honest.

Parents: There is no nudity or kissing but there is crushing on girls, bathroom humor, Greg sitting on the toilet, kids peeing in pools, a men's locker room walk through with butt crack and chests, and a scene were Greg is without his swimming trunks in the pool and has to wear girl shorts to get out.",1358208000,,1558,4.471830985915493

My son rented the movie from Amazon on his Kindle Fire HD while visiting over Christmas.  Myself, our 10 & 8 year old boys, and Grandma all piled on Grandma's bed and had a good laugh while watching it on the Kindle.  The picture and sound were good.  We had a little trouble with some delays, but discovered it may have been due to our daughters trying to access the internet at the same time we were watching the rental.  When they stopped, we didn't have any more trouble.",1357084800,,624,4.158333333333333

4816286,4,B005LAIITE,This is another great follow up to the original Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This has great laughs and all the original characters are in it. I laughed just as hard at this one as I did the first two. If you're a Diary of a Wimpy Kid fan or have middle school kids then this is the move to get before summer starts.,1356825600,,308,3.828125
4816287,4,B005LAIITE,We have watched the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid Movies and I think this was one of the best of the three.  This movie is great for boys the same age of the actors.,1356825600,,162,3.6285714285714286

The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series of movies, and especially this one, is very well done. Its silly and funny but offers some real life lessons. It is a fresh breath of air when compared to so much of the garbage kid shows on cable TV. Unlike so many movies targeted at my son's agegroup, this one is of high quality, including story line, production quality, acting and comedic value. Our whole family couldn't help but laugh out loud together, which in my opinion is a healthy tning for a family to do. Highly recommended movie, and series.",1356652800,5,690,4.3565891472868215

4816373,5,B005LAIITE,I started to what the Diary movies because I had nothing better to watch and it was cheap on Itunes. I became a fan of the films because they are funny and smart and reminded me of a time when you did not have to put up with alot to have fun. When your best friends with someone and not matter what they did to you the next day you were still friends with them. This is the third movie and I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first two. They are funny and smart.,1356566400,,465,3.7551020408163267
4816374,5,B005LAIITE,"My mom and I are big fans of these movies. We have always watched them together when they've come out. We watched this one tonight and it was really cute and funny. I don't think it was as good as the previous one, but it still made me want to check out the books. The best thing about these movies is that they stay true to what it's like to be a kid in the awkward transition of becoming a young adult. Each movie has a different theme (the first dealing with the need to gain popularity while the second portrays siblings overcoming differencces.) This one is about first crushes, adventurous summer days, and bonding with parents. These are really good, lighthearted, touching films anyone could enjoy!",1356480000,,706,4.566929133858268
4816375,5,B005LAIITE,"All three of the Diary of A Wimpy Kids movies are great! This one is just as good as the first two. All the same actors are back, which is always great, and they all do a wonderful job with their characters. Plenty of humor for the whole family.

This time around Greg seems to get in some bigger messes, which I guess can be expected since he is now a teenager. He still had the hots for Holly, which gets him in trouble a few times, his friendship with Rowley gets more than a little complicated, and so does his relationship with his father.

It doesn't matter if you have seen the first two movies or not, you (and your children) are guaranteed to love this movie, but if you haven't seen the first two I highly recommended them, because like this one they are hilarious.",1356480000,,775,4.26530612244898

4816379,5,B005LAIITE,My family loves this movie!  We saw it in the theaters this summer.  I decided to get it for my 9 year old son for Christmas.  Estimated arrival date was Dec 21st.  Well... its Dec 26th and I still haven't received the DVD yet.  Very disappointing.  Shame on you Amazon! If I had known I would have bought it at Walmart or Best Buy.,1356480000,,332,4.109375
4816400,3,B005LAIITE,"I have to admit I'm in my mid 30's, have 4 kids of my own, and I absolutely LOVED the first wimpy kid movie.  I thought it was a great wholesome family picture funny to both parents and kids alike.  I found the 2nd wimpy kid movie to be pretty good, still enjoyable, but not a classic like the first.  But the third?  UGH.  It's just not very good.  The movie needed more focus on the minor characters such as Chirag, Fregley, and Patty Farrell which made the first two movies so good.  It just seemed like Greg's shenanigans were forced in this movie as opposed to the typical pre-teen follies of the first two films.

I gave the flick 3 stars but to be honest that's based mostly off of knowing the characters.  If I'd never seen the first two I'd have given it one.",1356393600,,768,4.205479452054795

While this was still a good movie it feel a bit short on Rodrick where I feel most of the humor comes from. I love the interaction between the brothers.

What I love most about this movie and all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid is how family friendly the movies are.  Also though, this movie is not just for the young, but I have to say that all ages will find the circumstances portrayed to be hilarious and the trouble that these kids can get into awe-inspiring.

Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this thoroughly. As a parent I always am a bit wary to let my kids see movies unless I know exactly what is in them, but in this series of movies I can rest assured that the content is appropriate for school-aged kids, and all school aged kids will appreciate the situations that the characters have to face and deal with (but adults will also) and the family oriented nature of the film is also a big plus in my book!",1355356800,,1026,4.0945273631840795

4816513,5,B005LAIITE,Great family entertainment. We laughed almost the entire time. Reminded me of my younger days. Definitely recommend this movie to everyone from the age of 7 to 77.,1355097600,,163,4.857142857142857
4816514,5,B005LAIITE,"I think that this is one of the best family comedies of the year, Zachary Gordon does a terrific job with the character Greg, a lot of the stunts were copied from some mr. Bean episodes- just saying!

  Highly reccommended for comedy lovers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1354924800,,255,4.883720930232558

4816516,5,B005LAIITE,"For the parents out there who were disappointed with some of the negative influences in the first film, you will be happy to know that this movie is much, much more age appropriate, it has a good story to it that doesn't focus on being popular. like the first one. And, it has a great ending that will warm your heart and not make you question your decision to let your child watch the movie. lol My son is six and I have bought all of these for him (haven'r received this one yet) but he isn't allowed to watch the first one again until he is a little older and can better understand that Greg's attitude and willingness to do anything to be popular, even throwing his best friend under the bus by lying, is wrong and why it's wrong. I would recommend this one if you haven't seen any of them and your child is about 7 or under.. you don't really need the first two to understand this one.",1354579200,,890,4.180232558139535
