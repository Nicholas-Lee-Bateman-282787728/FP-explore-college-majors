In spite of a broken body, headaches, backaches and I had to laugh at this funny sitcom about the Grayson Brothers Department stores it reminds me of the old Hudson's Department store with the elevator operators calling out each floor stop, all the store personnel wearing some type of uniform and professionalism at its worst at  best.  you will enjoy the Grayson store family Mrs. Slocum,  Mr. Granger, young Humphries,The Col. will keep you laughing the whole time TB",1402358400,,618,4.961165048543689

As such, it is an excellent example of the genre,  but if you don't like the genre, it is probably not a good place to start.",950227200,6,284,4.549019607843137
