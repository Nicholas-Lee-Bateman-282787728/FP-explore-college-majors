8630834,1,B000QCQ880,"This series it self is a disaster.

Avoid buying any volumes in this set, or anything else from this company (Partners In Motion, Harmony Entertainment, History Television, all Canadian companies) especially if you want to complete a set of all 26 episodes, which is simply not possible.

Vol. 11 doesn't even have the two episodes that are described on the artwork cover, and instead repeat two completely irrelevant episodes from two other volumes.  (I went thru four copies, all defective, before I gave up buying any more copies.)

On top of that, the entire series are DVD-Rs and not quality copies.

The sampling rate of the entire series is very low, so the technical quality of the image is very poor, even for its day.

On top of that, each DVD has only 50 minutes of material on it, and no boxed set of the whole series exists at all, let alone any boxed set with a reasonable price for the whole series.

Since Amazon doesn't have a policy of selling pirated copies of any DVDs, I can only assume the production company made these copies available for Amazon to sell, in spite of their claims to the contrary.

I tried for over a YEAR to get them to provide a PROPER (Corrected) copy of Vol. 11 to complete my set and they just don't give the least damn about fixing it, so the entire series is big waste of money and time and should be entirely avoided.

A total rip-off!

Stay away from these and anything else from this company by all means.

Not worth the plastic they're made out of!",1488412800,,1499,4.474264705882353

8630836,3,B000QCQ880,"""Disasters of the Century: Stormy Waters"" is a Canadian produced documentary that splits its time between the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 and The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. I bought the DVD primarily for the information on the Great Lakes storm of November 1913 which sunk 19 ships (from fairly small vessels to very large steel freighters) and killed almost 250 sailors. It is still the deadliest modern storm on the inland seas, and is well worthy of a documentary. The DVD nicely explains the timeline and meteorological information relevant to the storm, and profiles a few of the ships and sailors involved. Some of the archival photos and footage are of great interest to anyone interested in Great Lakes history, and based on that alone I recommend the DVD despite the relatively high price of the disc. The interviews are also well done and do a good job telling the dramatic story of the mega-disaster.

The Labor Day Hurricane demolished the Florida Keys long before accurate forecasting existed. Several survivors were interviewed and much dramatic footage is used (I am not sure where and when some of it was taken) to generally good effect. The interviews with survivors were very good and insightful, but otherwise I found this portion of the DVD dragged, especially in regards to the meteorology involved. The tale and reenactment of the veterans rescue train was well done, and was clearly a major focus of the investigations that followed. The other reenactments in this segment were less captivating and took quite a bit of screen time, which is a shame as the underlying story is fascinating.

My rating for the DVD is three stars: the value proposition is not compelling (it's a short production and a relatively expensive disc) and portions of the production occasionally suffer from pacing issues. Having said that, I still do recommend the DVD overall, especially to people interested in the Great Lakes storm of 1913.",1391212800,2,1941,4.950920245398773
