2355282,5,B000A3456C,"I have been researching the UFO question including crop circles, animal mutilations and human abductions for about 15 years. I've seen 90% of the available videos and read many of the books available on these subjects. This 3 DVD collection is head and shoulders above most presentations. Opinion is kept to a minimum, and verifiable evidence is kept at the forefront. I recommend that anyone who watches this series and maintains the position that we are not being visited should watch it again and pay attention this time. The evidence is indisputable.",1125878400,71,554,5.032608695652174

8073737,1,B000A3456C,"Are they ever going make new videos! These videos are so old that they look like they're from the 1900's! You'd think they would have some new videos in 2017, most of these are from 1999 and earlier! And does anyone actually pay $30 bucks for these outdated videos, lol!!",1510963200,,271,4.44

8073741,3,B000A3456C,"It's not bad, but there are better videos on the topic. See the classic UFO's Are Real or the UFO Hunters television series.",1309824000,3,124,4.434782608695652
8073742,3,B000A3456C,"First of all I can't believe this DVD set is still 35.99$, I bought it 4 years ago for the exact same price !! Anyway....So I bought this 3 Disc set 4 years ago with very, very high expectations. After watching the 3 documentaries for the first time I was a little bit disappointed. Oh don't get me wrong, all 3 documentaries are very well done and are full of great informations on the UFO phenomena. However something is missing, and the more I watched the documentaries the more I was able to find flaws and things I didn't liked. George Knapp is a good journalist, but in my opinion not a great host. Also some of the ""credible"" researchers featured in the documentaries are...well not very credible to me.

Since you can find all 3 documentaries on Youtube I won't recommand you to buy this DVD Set, not for that price. However if one day ( and that's a huge ""if"" ) this DVD is available for less than 20$ then buy it, it's still a good addition to a collection.",1309046400,6,967,4.313186813186813
8073743,3,B000A3456C,I would encourage people to look through these many films and buy the highest rated film out there. After one or two your wasting your money because all these films differ little between each other. Three stars is all i could give this one because  i have so many of them. If this is your first film about the subject than you will most likely give it four or five stars. Do yourself a favor and stop at two.,1255478400,2,408,4.1645569620253164
8073744,5,B000A3456C,This is a must have for any serious UFO investigator.  I love George Knapp and he presents a good case for UFOS.,1240099200,11,112,4.090909090909091
8073745,4,B000A3456C,"Very good, well presented. The 3 DVD's covereed each topic well. I would recommend purchase of this product.",1200873600,7,108,5.055555555555555
