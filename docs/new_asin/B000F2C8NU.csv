8116521,1,B000F2C8NU,"This is NOT a R0/R1 release of the R2 dvd by the same name, Take That For The Record THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTARY, as widely advertised.

This is a ""100% unauthorized"" (taken directly from the back insert) RIP-OFF titled Take That For The Record A CRITICAL FILM REVIEW.

This is another one of those occasions when one should be permitted to rate an item ZERO.

BOOOOO!",1303171200,2,365,4.584615384615384
8116522,4,B000F2C8NU,"I couldn't play this DVD on my player because of the incompatibility of the region.  This DVD was made to play on DVD players in Europe not the USA.  I was able to watch it on my lap top.  The documentary is interesting if you are not familiar with ""Take That"" past history.  I think this band's music is phenomenal.  I am very surprise they are not as famous in the USA.  I just discovered their music recently while in Australia.  Their concert ""The Circus"" is awesome.",1293148800,2,471,4.344827586206897

This is a great dvd because it gives you a look inside what was going on with all of them during that time, and after the breakup. So for any fan out there thinking of buying this I think you will really enjoy it a lot.",1202169600,2,270,3.754385964912281
