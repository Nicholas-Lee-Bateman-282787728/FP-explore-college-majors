8275920,5,B001A3YHHS,I love the old Charlie Chan movies.  The plots were simple but they were enjoyable and often funny.  No real violence or foul language.,1391472000,2,135,4.583333333333333
8275921,4,B001A3YHHS,"Some films are not meant to be taken seriously; in addition to watching Chan solve a murder, we also look to see the humor. A million dollars in bonds are stolen and two men are murdered. The wife of the bond owner gave $25,000 in bonds to a bartender. A woman enchants the bond owner's male secretary while expressing love to the bond holder's rival. Chan solves the murders and robbery. We have fun watching him do this, but also by seeing the bizarre ways his son acts, how he tries to speak French in Monte Carlo and gets his father and him arrested, how Chan's friend the head of the police acts foolishly, the strange behavior of a taxi driver and his broken taxi, and Chan's frequent unusual quotes, such as ""tongue often hang man quicker than rope.""",1314489600,2,757,4.453237410071942

  This is not a silent picture. It is a movie with full sound and dialogue and the first FOX movie with ""Charlie Chan"" and the man portraying him is Asian.

  Not a bad movie for 1929. Held my interest. Sure am glad movies had greatly improved 10 years later from 1929 to 1939. The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Gone With The Wind (1939) was a big step forward in film making.

8275923,3,B001A3YHHS,"Charlie Chan in Monte Carlo, 1935 film

Mr. Chan and son register to enter a casino. Lee talks to the Commandant of Police, who welcomes them. Lee has a plan to play a lucky number. They see a high stakes game of chance, ""chemin de fer"" (railroad). Talk isn't cheap here. Some talk about missing bonds. Lee likes detective work instead of painting pictures. There is comedy in a taxicab! We learn more about the missing bonds. A search of the safe finds them! A communication problem? Chan and son walk on. They find an abandoned automobile. [Too much foreign language?] What happened to the chauffeur? It was Victor Karnoff's car. The bank messenger had a million dollars in bonds. M. Joubert has a list of the serial numbers; they were offered for sale in Paris by a mere waiter!

Chan sees a car like the one by the road. Mlle. Evelyn Grey owns this car, but denies using it. A missing rhinestone ties her to the murder scene. People are questioned. Playing with fire? The missing chauffeur Ludwig is found, but he won't talk. Karnoff has his own way of dealing with theft. Waiter Rogers says he has the bonds. Lee says ""never mind"" to the elevator boy. Evelyn talks to Severyn about the situation. The waiter is investigated. Mrs. Karnoff pawned her jewels. Rogers was called away from his job. Lee snoops, and is seen. Rogers won't talk now. He was left-handed; the bonds were planted on him. Mrs. Karnoff tells what Rogers did. How can you stop blackmail? Who would have planted the missing bonds? Charlie knows who did it. Who had access to the key and the safe? ""Rogers was shot with a different gun."" Only the murderer would know that! Severyn and Grey are ordered to leave Monte Carlo, they are undesirable characters.

This is an average movie that must have been popular in the 1930s. People then had been swindled by worthless bonds and stocks. This loss of wealth, along with lowered wages and income, led to the Great Depression. ""Stolen Bonds"" symbolizes this swindling of investors. Was there too much use of a foreign language? [Subtitles were not invented yet.] Was this a sequel to ""CC in Paris"" which was a better movie? Werner Oland, a nationally famous actor, originated the ""Charlie Chan"" character in the movies.",1302480000,,2237,4.6725888324873095
