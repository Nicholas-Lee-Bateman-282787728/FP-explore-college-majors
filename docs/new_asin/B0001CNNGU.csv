8010224,2,B0001CNNGU,"On the 3rd day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...NWA Starracde 1987. The 6 tag team match between the team of Larry Zbyszko,Eddie Gilbert & Rick Steiner against the team of Michael Hayes,Jimmy Garvin & Sting was a fun match to say the least. The UWF title match between ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & Barry Windham was boring yet extremely entertaining. The Scaffold match was The Rock & Roll Express against The Midnight Express was entertaining but severely limited. The Title Unification match for both the NWA & UWF TV titles between Nikita Koloff & Terry Taylor was not great but pretty good. The Worlds Tag Team title match between The Road Warriors & The 4 Horsemen(Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard) was a great bout but had a terrible ending. The US title match between Lex Luger & Dusty Rhodes was a boring match with a poor finish and a wrong result to boot. The Steel Cage match for the Worlds title between Ric Flair & Ronnie Garvin was very disappointing with Flair carrying Garvin most of the time. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1355616000,,1045,4.534391534391534
8010225,3,B0001CNNGU,"WWE Classics On Demand once again aired a classic PPV from the past that I was able to catch in NWA's Starrcade '87.  This was a historical PPV for various reasons such as the first & only time that the wrestling companies have went head to head on PPV on the same night as WWE debuted Survivor Series on this same Thanksgiving night as this was also the first time that Starrcade (or any NWA event) was available on a PPV.  It should also be noted that it was around this time that the NWA had purchased Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation so this was the first big event that featured the talent from that promotion...including Sting & Jim Ross.

Sting, Michael Hayes, Jimmy Garvin vs. Eddie Gilbert, Rick Steiner, Larry Zbyszko - You saw the potential & starpower Sting was destined for in this match right from the ring introductions as he got the loudest pop than anyone else in the match.  This was a great opening match that started off wild and went back & forth between each team with Michael Hayes really knowing how to work the crowd.

UWF Champion Steve Williams vs. Barry Windham - This was setup to be a ""Williams' power vs. Windham's technique"" match knowing both men's styles.  However this was one of those matches that never went past ""first gear"" as both were very cautious eventhough they pulled out some suprises on the other like Windham showing some power with a twisted side suplex while Williams showed some wrestling by being able to hold on to a headlock despite Windham's consistant attempts to roll out out the move.  The big standout moment came here where a Steve Williams leapfrog went terribly wrong to the point where he never recovered from the rest of the match which ended quickly after that incident...almost as if an audible was called to end the match early.  This was a real disappointment to the point where the vocal fans chanted ""boring"" early & booed after seeing the result.

""Skywalkers"" Scaffold Match: Rock `N Roll Express vs. Midnight Express - Eventhough this is the weakest match in their feud due to the setup of the match, this match was more ""entertaining"" than the previous years scaffold match as we saw Big Bubba get involved along with various weapons used like parts from the scaffold itself & Cornette's own tennis racket.
(""Starrcade: The Essental Collection"")

Unification Match: NWA Television Champion Nikita Koloff vs. UWF Television Champion Terry Taylor - This was the second UWF championship match of the night but after this match, this championship would be merged into the NWA Television Title.  Nikita Koloff dominated early by grounding Taylor & working on his arm while Terry kept going to the floor & stalling on the ground whenever Nikita was gaining momentum after his plan of going head to head with Nikita kept failing.  Taylor finally got the advantage after Nikita missed his famous ""sicle"" & worked on Koloff's knee while Eddie Gilbert (Taylor's manager) got his shots in on Nikita as well before it backfired resulting in Nikita walking away with both championships.

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard & Road Warriors - In their hometown of Chicago, the Warriors were after the Tag Team titles. This a clash of power in the Warriors vs. the wrestling technicians of the Horsemen with great storytelling by both teams.  Unfortunally, the end result wasn't what the Chicago crowd wanted.
(""Starrcade: The Essential Collection"" & ""Road Warriors"")

Steel Cage Match: NWA United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Dusty Rhodes - This one had the stipulation that Dusty was going ot be suspended for 90 days if he lost and they had Johnny Weaver at ringside as the gatekeeper. Dusty worked a different offense than usual as he kept going to sleeperholds throughout the match including the ""Weaver-lock"" that Johnny Weaver made famous while grinding on Luger's arm to take away the Torture Rack. Luger also worked over Dusty's arm & used his power along with the used the cage to bust Dusty open. The ending would not only result in Dusty gaining the United States Championship but also mark the beginning of the end of Luger's membership in the Four Horsemen.
(""The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story"")

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ronnie Garvin vs. Ric Flair - This is one of those matches that's more remembered for what happened outside of the match than the actual inring action itself as eventhough Garvin worked his usual ""stiff"" style here, the crowd completely turned on him & cheered Flair who was the workhorse in this match.  There really wasn't anything special about the inring action aside from Garvin doing his ""stomp"" that most current day fans are used to seeing a ""viper"" perform but past that, Flair walked out again ""The Man.""

In the end, this was a good event from the NWA eventhough they would go on to have better  events in the following months (the first Clash & The Bash PPV) & with the exception of the opening match...the best matches on this card are already available on various DVD's so unless your a heavy NWA fan or collector, this is an event I would recommend for a reasonable price.",1268870400,,5126,4.778280542986425
8010226,3,B0001CNNGU,"Once again, thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I was able to relive another event from the NWA/WCW era. During this time, Ronnie Garvin was the NWA Champion (why?) who was feuding with Ric Flair but the real story here was the Road Warriors returning to Chicago to receive their shot at the Tag Team Championship. Now for those history fans, this was the event that was taken off most cable systems due to WWF showcasing the first ever Survivor Series on the same night. Also, this was the Starrcade debut of Jim Ross.

Sting & The Freebirds vs Eddie Gilbert, Rick Steiner & Larry Zbyszko. This was a showcase for Sting & Steiner as they mostly did the work here & it was interesting to hear the crowd favor Sting above everyone else since he was just starting out at this point. Everyone had their moments & despite the time limit draw, this was a good opener & a nice way to start the show.

UWF Heavyweight Champion Barry Windham vs ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams. This was one of those matches that ended when it was just getting good as there was a lot of stalling early with both men showing respect for each other with the only memorable moment being Williams attempting a leap frog & nailing himself in the groin. However, the big issue was how the match ended that sort of questioned the friendship factor between both men.

Skywalkers Match: The Midnight Express vs Rock & Roll Express. Despite the fancy name, this was just a scaffold match. I am not a big fan of these matches since they are really dull with the only cool spot being when someone falls from that height. However, this was more entertaining than the one they did the year before with Big Bubba getting involved from time to time & both teams using Cornette's racket.

Unification Match: NWA Television Champion Nikita Koloff vs UWF Television Champion Terry Taylor. This was a good match as Koloff was using his power early & for the most part, that was the story of the match as Taylor had to resort to his technical ability or even cheating to get the advantage.

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs The Road Warriors. This was the match that most of the fans wanted to see as the Warriors were in their hometown of Chicago. A classic tag team wrestling match with Hawk & Animal using their power offense while Arn & Tully used classic tag team strategy by cutting the ring off & working on the arm of Hawk. However, the ending was kinda of a jip & really killed the payoff that the crowd WANTED to see.

Steel Cage Match: United States Champion Lex Luger vs Dusty Rhodes. The first of two steel cage championship matches. This match started slow but it slowly build some momentum with both men using the cage to their advantage along with JJ Dillon getting involved in the action & Dusty even getting busted open at one point.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ronnie Garvin vs Ric Flair. All I am going to say about this one was that Flair carried this match from start to finish. The crowd's reaction here was on point as even though Garvin was the face, they booed him out of the building & cheered wildly for Flair. This did have some stiff moments with the cage being used & both men exchanging vicious chops. In the end, Flair would regain the title for the fifth time.

Overall, this event was watchable but for the most part, I felt that the NWA dropped the ball here as they have delivered much better Starrcade events than this (as the next two editions would prove) so I would recommend a look but not a must see event. Plus, the two best matches here are on the Starrcade DVD.",1267660800,,3583,4.451219512195122
8010227,4,B0001CNNGU,"WCW Starrcade '87 was during the NWA era, which meant the angles and business moves didn't make much sense! However, the action inside the ring was as good if not better than what was going on in the WWF/WWE at the time. Here is what's on here:

Michael ""P.S."" Hayes, ""Gorgeous"" Jimmy Garvin & Sting Vs. Larry Zybsco, ""Hot Stuff"" Eddie Gilbert (RIP), & Rick Steiner - A six man tag team match to open things up! This was pretty much all Sting and Rick Steiner with their veteran teammates there for backup (though they did good as well). Ends in a 20 minute draw.

""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams Vs. Barry Windham (UWF Title Match) - Before his Horseman run, Barry Windham was a top contender for the Universal Wrestling Federation title held by legendary strongman ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams. The match was kept rather scientific with the only bad move of the match was where Williams tried a leapfrog on Windham only get his ""manhood"" headbutted! OUCH!

This match ends when Williams rolled up Windham in an ""Oklahoma Roll"" as Windham tried to get back into the ring.

The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton/Stan Lane) w/Jim Cornette Vs. The Rock n Roll Express (Scaffold Match) - This was a step down from the previous year's scaffold match with The Road Warriors (LOD) took on the Midnights! The only exciting parts were when Big Bubba (Big Bossman/RIP) got involved! Ends when Rick Morton and Robert Gibson double-teamed Bobby Eaton to get him off the scaffold. Worth one look and then skip!

Nikita Koloff Vs. Terry Taylor (NWA World TV Title Vs. UWF World TV Title) - This was a unification match where the winner would claim both titles. This was actually a good match but admittedly, Koloff dominated most of this match with exceptions of Taylor taking advantage of a mis-cue from Koloff or interference from the late ""Hot Stuff"" Eddie Gilbert. Ends when Koloff takes advantage of a miscut from Taylor and Gilbert and hits his legendary Russian Sickle clothesline for the pin and the title!

Tully Blanchard/Arn Anderson w/J.J. Dillon Vs. The Road Warriors w/""Precious"" Paul Ellering (NWA World Tag Team Title Match) - A classic tag team match but be warned, the Turner Home Entertainment version is edited! To see the unedited version, get the WWE release called ""The Road Warrios: The Life & Death Of Wrestling's Most Dominant Tag Team.""

This one ends controversially as referee Tommy Young says he saw Road Warrior Animal backdrop Arn Anderson over the top rope (which was a DQ back then). Thing that gets me is that Young was turned the other way when this happened?! How could he say he saw it?! Talk about bad acting?! To make matters worse, this is after the back up referee counted The Roadies' pin of Arn Anderson after the ""Doomsday Device.""

Anyway, the Horsemen duo retain the straps.

""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes Vs. ""The Total Package"" Lex Luger (NWA U.S. Title Match) - This one was in a cage with the stipulation that if Dusty lost, he couldn't wrestle for an extended period of time. I think it was 90 days.

Anyway, it starts slow but picks up as it goes along. Ends when Rhodes DDT's Luger onto a steel chair for the pin and the title. This match is also edited on the T.H.E. release. To see the full match, get either that old Starrcade collection that shows matches from 1983-87 or get WWE's release on Dusty Rhodes. Both releases show this match in its entirety.

""Hands Of Stone"" Ron Garvin Vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair (NWA World Title Match) - This one was also in a cage and is also edited down too! If you can find it, get that Starrcade release that Turner put out in 1988 to see this in its entirety!

As for the match itself, Flair definitely carried this bout but I'll give credit to Garvin for this. He was one of the stiffiest guys ever to work in wrestling. By that I mean this, much like when you would wrestle The Road Warriors (in their prime), The Steiners, Chris Benoit, Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody or one of the Von Erichs (particularly Fritz, Kevin, Kerry or David), when you got in the ring with Garvin, expect to take a good whoopin' whether you won or lost! Flair was no exception!

Match ends when Flair actually kicks out of Garvin's vaunted knockout punch! Garvin then tries to throw Flair into the ropes but Flair reverses and ""Stun Gun""'s Garvin into the cage, knocking him out and getting the pin!

Though edited, it is still worth the price to see. Unless its a mint tape, I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it!",1213833600,,4464,4.59874213836478
8010228,4,B0001CNNGU,"Starrcade '87 gave fans at least one last chance to see their favorite NWA stars before Ted Turner and Eric Bischoff's control which led to the birth of WCW.

The opener had Michael Hayes, Jimmy Garvin and Sting taken on Eddie Gilbert, Rick Steiner and Larry Zybsko. All I can say about this match was that it was all Sting and Steiner's. The other guys were just their to lend a helping hand.

The second match had Universal Wrestling Federation Champion, Steve ""Dr. Death"" Williams defending against NWA Western States Champion, Barry Windham. The match lasted barely 10 minutes when Williams craddled Windham from behind for the 1-2-3. However highlight in that match had Williams attempting to leap-frog Windham, only to headbut him right where it hurts.

""Skywalkers II"", yeah right. Besides the Fall Brawl 2000 scafold match with Madusa and Kidman versus Shane Douglas and Torrie Wilson, the match at Starrcade '87 with the Midnight Express and the Rock and Roll Express was a complete joke. See the match yourself, you will believe me than see the first skywalkers match with L.O.D. and the Midnight Express and find what the best one was.

Nikita Koloff sickled Terry Taylor to unify the NWA and UWF Television Titles.

Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson defeated L.O.D. to retain the World Tag Team Titles.

Dusty Rhodes saves his career by winning the United States Title by beating Lex Lugar in a steel cage. (Earl Hebnar was the ref.)

Ronnie Garvin lost in his first World Title defense against Ric Flair in a cage match. This was Flair's fifth world title win.

Overall, it was an okay show. I had the tape since I was six and man good ol' J.R. had a much younger voice.",1117324800,,1682,4.736301369863014
