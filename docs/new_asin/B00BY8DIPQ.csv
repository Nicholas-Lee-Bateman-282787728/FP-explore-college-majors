8575321,2,B00BY8DIPQ,"Somewhat disappointing story, the main actors were solid enough, Virginia Gilmore appealing enough and Dana Andrews a reliable contributor as always. The story however lacked believability, too contrived. Two stars and a half at best.",1390953600,4,234,5.714285714285714
8575322,4,B00BY8DIPQ,"Here is a story that viovifly goes behdind the battls scenes to
show reporters seeking tg get the facts and real story under
almost impossible stress,  Well acted, and perhaps even
timely in some countries today.",1377216000,5,212,4.888888888888889
8575323,4,B00BY8DIPQ,"Silly and as outlandish a movie as it can get. But everything combines to make a most enjoyable 70 minutes of suspended reality. Here you see the cream of Hollywood Nazis - Martin Kosleck, Sig Rumen, Hans Schumm, Kurt Katch, Henry Roland and Otto Reichow - exhibit the heights of mental ineptness. The sequence where Andrews and Rumen are in underwear is alone worth the price of this DVD. The Fox Cinema Archives transfer is nearly flawless and far, far better quality than the copies that have been floating for years on the market. You won't be disappointed.",1367366400,15,561,4.73469387755102
8575324,1,B00BY8DIPQ,"Very poor quality will not watch it, they expected me to drive over to Brooklyn to return the movie. Why did I spend almost 30 dollars, to throw it in the garbage?",1364428800,4,163,4.125
