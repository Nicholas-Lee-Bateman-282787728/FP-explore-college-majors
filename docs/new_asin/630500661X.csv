949679,5,630500661X,"Being somewhat suspect of Marlon Wayans on the big screen, I was apprehensive about watching this one.  I am glad I did.  David Spade was his hilarious, sarcastic self and Marlon was very funny in this slapstick  comedy.  The movie also has a very credible underlying story in a college  student doing whatever it takes to pay for college.",911347200,,339,4.677966101694915

949822,4,630500661X,"I choose this rating because I love good and great comedy movies. This movie was coming from a diffrent perspective(not the hood) The Wayans have many classic movies, if you are a fan of the families work add it to your collection.",1372032000,,231,4.523809523809524

949857,5,630500661X,"This movie is the best most funniest movie ever. i have seen this movie I don't know atleast 50 times. I never get sick of it. Its sooo funny, it will make you laugh your you know what off.
get it. you won't be upset with yourself at all. You will love it!",1197849600,2,256,3.849056603773585
949858,4,630500661X,"This movie came out in the late 90s when Marlon was in his prime. This is one of his better films, you know what to expect from the Wayans, laugh out loud comedy. You seen the show The Wayans Bros.(WHICH SHOULD OF NEVER GOT CANCELED!!! I WAS SO HEATED) but i digress lol, this movie is great, original material, the movie has a good concept, Marlon is spectacular. Buy this along with The Sixth Man, that movie is good money too.",1192665600,,429,4.308641975308642
949859,4,630500661X,Marlon Wayens is a college student who has lots of jobs in order to survive. But the biggest job he wants is a Wall Street firm he will do whatever it takes to get it so when went to see some guy who did a test subject on him that makes his senses be king size greater then any average human. But if he take a over dose he can lose his sense's at a time. The stuff has to wear off at a time by it leaking out of him on it's own. I thought it was funny when he meat this homeless person he couldn't see at the time the homeless person knew it so he took advantage and stoll his clothes he was nude.,1124496000,,597,3.7086614173228347
949860,5,630500661X,"This movie was much funnier than I thought it would be. I had meduim expectations, because the Waynes brothers are all hilarious, but I'd never heard of the movie, which isn't a good sign. First of all, never judge a movie and how funny it is if you watch it on cable. The editors and censors on tv edit some very funny stuff out of movies. Anyway, if you liked ""white chicks"", ""hot chick"", or any movie that includes lots of funny faces or drug humour, you'll love this movie (actually there is NO drug humour if I remember right, but the humour style reminds me of the type of  humour that is found on Orange County when Jack Black administers ecxtacy to the Dean of the school - if you haven't seen it you should).

This movie is funny enough that I saw it once and I've already bought it. Also, if you have seen ""Without a Paddle"" you should, that movie is funnnnny.",1105056000,,870,4.266666666666667
949861,5,630500661X,"I've seen this movie a dozen times (and no, I'm not a nerd) and it never get's less funny.  The jokes still make me laugh just as hard.  Marlon Wayans really shows off his comedic talent in this, probably more than any other movie he's ever done.  See it and you'll know what I mean.  The script is solid, and David Spade is the same as always, which is a good thing.  I love the line ""Dad, I know you love me!  Remember that time you almost said it?""  Check this movie out.  Stuck up people with absolutely no sense of humor should not see this movie though, I wouldn't want them to actually have a good time while watching something, now would I?",1102550400,,648,4.169354838709677
949862,5,630500661X,"This movie has nothing but comedy written all over it. Fast moving plot with the right recipe of characters. Hilarious to the bone and excellent set up. If you are looking for a great laugh and enjoy the humor only David Spade and Marlon Wayans can bring, pick this one up. An excellent addition to any DVD collection. Fun for all to watch!",1086566400,3,340,4.412698412698413
949863,3,630500661X,"Well, well, well, in the beginning it was cool comedy. No, not just cool but REALLY COOL comedy about black guy who took part in some experiment which upgraded his senses. Kind of super-power. A lot of funny (REALLY FUNNY) situations, dumb, but great jokes etc. etc. Cool movie. I hadn't laughed in such a way for a long time.
But then... Oops! The movie became less funny, some kind of soap appeared there, the authors seemed to remember about correctness and that's why the ending wasn't as cool and funny as beginning.
I'm so sorry. But only 3 stars.",1010016000,3,553,4.54
949864,4,630500661X,"Marlon Wayans gets forced into the role of ""the stupid slapstick guy"" thankfully he doesn't play that part in this very underatted classic. This movie had me laughing and feeling great! With a hillarious performance by Matthew Lillard and a great evil characted portrayal from David Spade you have to check this one out... Cheap and above all fun!",1006992000,2,347,4.898305084745763
949865,4,630500661X,seeing marlon wayans naked is the only reason to see this movie and its soooooooooo worth it,996710400,,92,4.470588235294118
949866,3,630500661X,"Everyone is wrong, and the back of the tape case/cover is wrong too. This movie wouldn't be called hilarious or not even funny. It had some and very few rare humored comical parts to it. I was thinking about giving it a 2 but i don't wanna make it look that bad. DON'T BUY IT, just rent it if you wanna see a 90 minute boring film.",994982400,,331,3.955223880597015
949867,4,630500661X,"I was expecting a crude and hilarious movie, and thats what i got.  Marlon wayans did an awesome job filling in a Jim- Carrey type part.  He is a college student that needs money, so he becomes a lab rat for this scientist testing a drug to improve the senses.  everything seems to be going good for him until he overdoses, with hilarious results.  Although this was david spades worst movie and i was expecting more from him, marlon wayans makes up for it.  Definite Reccomend if your looking for a light hearted crude comedy",989539200,,526,4.494736842105263
949868,1,630500661X,"Sense - less (-lis) adj. 1. unconscious  2. not having or showing good sense; foolish; stupid  3.  having no real point or purpose; meaningless.
Yep, that basically describes the movie, seeing how senseless a movie can been.  When two of Hollywood's best and brightest team up, you know it's going to be good!  The plot and comedy (by the way, this is a comedy, right?) are very, very predictable (Predictable comedies are always the best, right?).  I would not suggest watching, buying, renting, talking about, thinking about watching, or looking at.",984614400,,551,5.0
