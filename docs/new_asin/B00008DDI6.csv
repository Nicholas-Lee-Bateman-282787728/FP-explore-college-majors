1835199,3,B00008DDI6,"VAN NUYS BLVD.
The best of this bunch, especially if you've ever actually been to Van Nuys, and the theme song is hilarious.  It's mostly just a loose collection of scenes, very few of which have anything to do with cruising or Van Nuys Boulevard.  It's really more of a California fantasy lifestyle teen flick than anything else, loosely based on car culture, sex in vans, the beach, etc.  Director's commentary is only occasionally interesting but at least there is one.  Some lame-brain comedic scenarios, a lot of toplessness, and one scene that would be right at home in American Pie.  But in spite of product claims to the contrary, Bobby does not 'get involved with topless dancers and bikers'.  There is dancing, there is toplessness, there are bikers of a sort, but that's not the same thing.

THE POM POM GIRLS
A fun dumb high school flick that isn't really about the Pom Pom Girls.  It's mainly about rebellious football dudes (who are remarkably non-jock types) playing outrageous pranks on each other and their rival high school.  Loose, freewheeling, unencumbered by plot, but enjoyable.

THE BABYSITTER
The only black-and-white movie in this bunch and a pretty solid b-movie that balances the legitimate acting of George E. Carey against the guilty pleasures of gratuitous sex, bikers, lesbians, psychedelic bands, etc.  But who wrote the synopsis on the DVD package?  Were they high, or did they write it two weeks after seeing it and confuse the details?  Candy does not ""take a job working for the powerful district attorney"" - she has an affair with a prosecutor who works for the DA.  Candy also does not ""step in and blackmail the D.A."" - she tries to stop a biker chick from blackmailing George, the prosecutor.  Get your story straight, man!

BLOOD MANIA
Another fine example of exaggerated titling and bunko synopsis writing.  There are 2 murders but it's hardly blood mania.  Craig, a doctor who used to perform abortions, is being blackmailed for 50 grand by a hilariously miscast 'heavy'.  One of Craig's patients is a wealthy old benefactor, the daughter of whom is a crazy art chick who is in love with Craig.  She decides to kill the old man to get the inheritance money to solve Craig's blackmail problem, but it doesn't work.  This has a Movie of the Week feel, for the most part.  But again, the synopsis on the DVD package is way off - it is not about ""a scorned daughter [who] murders her abortionist/physician father to get his inheritance and help out her junkie boyfriend.""

WEEKEND WITH THE BABYSITTER
Written and produced by the star, George E. Carey, who also wrote, produced, and starred in The Babysitter.  Almost the same film, just updated a bit and in color this time, with a subplot about a heroin addict wife getting caught up in a botched drug deal on a boat.  There's a disconcerting combination of faux hippy culture, shamelessly age-inappropriate sex, and moments of unabashed sincerity.  A strange mishmash of The Trip (lite), Hawaii Five-O and Lolita.  And another cul-de-sac sudden ending.

MALIBU BEACH
Very light fare, typical beach movie.

Update:

School's out for summer and attention turns to the new lifeguard at Malibu beach, Dina, guilelessly played by Kim Lankford.  In this corner, weighing in at roughly 200 pounds of weightlifting, gum-chewing, Speedo-wearing, referring-to-himself-in-the-third-person stupidity we have Dugan (Steve Oliver), the sandkicker.  In the other corner, we have the requisite Bobby (James Daughton of Animal House fame), a nice guy with a winning smile, a flip blonde hairdo, and a Jeep.  Bobby and Dina spend the summer cavorting with their friends, Sally and Paul, getting their harmless kicks at the beach.

The film sports subtle gimmicks like stoned cops, a belching shark and a dog that steals bikini tops, but for God's sake, what cretin is looking for subtlety in a movie called Malibu Beach?  It's nothing more than what it purports to be: a lighthearted teenage flick about girls, cars, summer, and dumb pranks - the 1978 equivalent of a Beach Boys song.  The teenagers appear to be played by people well into their 20s (or later), but this type of attention to detail is not going to best serve the viewing audience.  Just kick back and enjoy the carefree, pre-digital vibe, when media/information/constant communication was not of general interest, 18 was the legal drinking age, there were no helmet or seat belt laws, drinking and driving was tacitly approved of and irony/sarcasm was not yet ubiquitous.  It truly looks like an alien culture, if that's the correct word, though one that has a certain mindless appeal and effortless spontaneity.  When's the last time you smoked a joint on the beach, swigged out of a jug of cheap wine and went skinny-dipping with a group of brand-new friends?

As for under the radar kicks, watch for Ms. Plickett, the uptight teacher Dugan attempts to seduce - it's Jan Brady's lesser-known sister,  Flora Plumb.  The [initial] resemblance should pretty much hit you over the head.  Watch for Bobby's yellow Crown Pictures International t-shirt, and Sally sporting one that promotes the Bla Bla Cafe, a legendary Studio City hangout of the era.  Wait, was that a Honda CVCC?  ""1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the girl who plays pinball like it's important to be at eye-level with the playing field.""  And if you've seen Van Nuys Blvd, there will be a few locations, themes and cameos that should look familiar, such as Bill Adler as Vanner [Who did he play in Van Nuys Blvd again?  Oh yeah, Bobby.]  and Glorianna, played by the rather sensual Tara Strohmeier.

On the more overt front, will there be a chickie run?  A disco party with alarming fashion, big-hair androgyny, some sweet ADR and genre songs you'll never hear elsewhere?  A final ridiculous showdown with Dugan?  Oh man, would I ruin shit like that for the likes of you?!

PINK ANGELS
The first time I tried, I could not finish this movie.  The setup of six gay bikers riding down the West coast to a drag cotillion in L.A. was fine, but the seemingly improvised dialogue and sketch comedy scenes of clashes with straight society felt like it wasn't paying off really - neither funny nor particularly captivating.  I just watched it a second time, to the end, and although it is somewhat trying at times, the shocker of an ending recontextualizes the ambling, slight scenes that lead up to it and add an unexpected layer of poignancy.

In typical early 70s fashion, the Angels shock and run afoul of the law, roadside diner employees, clothing store clerks, a straight motorcycle gang, and so on, interspersed with plenty of road footage and initially inexplicable cuts to a general in a remote office.  It's essentially a typical loose counterculture road movie with a gay twist.  As genres go, it's probably one-of-a-kind, and as gay cinema, it's probably also historically significant.  I just thought it fell short of the mark in terms of comedy, characters, and what I generally am looking for in ""drive-in cult classic""-type films: either so bad it's good, or surprisingly good for how bad I expected it to be.

SINGLE ROOM FURNISHED
Painfully horrible.  Within 15 minutes you're in a digression within a digression and have the sinking feeling you stumbled into a black box theater where a scene study class is taking place.  A blue collar couple is on a fake firescape talking about their not-actually poignant lives.  The guy can't for the life of him fake a New York accent and can't stop moving his head with every word he speaks.  Gave up after 30 minutes.  Two nights later I picked up where I left off.  That scene thankfully ended and another couple was introduced.  They were no more watchable than the first, so I gave up again.",1246406400,85,7746,4.86707410236822

1835201,5,B00008DDI6,"The films and picture quality were very wonderful.  While the other two box sets had some real duds on them, I am happy to say that every film on this box set was watchable, and enjoyable.  While the movies are by no means oscar worthy, they deliver the trashy thrill fans of this genre will love.  If you bought the other two, or were holding out, this is the one to grab.  Happy Viewings!",1226880000,55,390,4.22972972972973
1835202,5,B00008DDI6,"Here is another fine collection of Crown International Pictures' drive-in movie madness. You get eight classic b-movies all lovingly restored using new film transfers (with the exception of The Babysitter, which was mastered from PAL tape). I won't go into the plots of each film (I figure anyone who is seriously looking at this page already has an appreciation for schlock cinema and can navigate his/her way to IMDb) but I can tell you that the films look great. For example, Blood Mania's crisp, wide-screen picture looks about a thousand times better than its full frame VHS release; there are no scratches or drop-outs and the sound is fantastic.

I constantly look forward to all BCI/Navarre Corporation's releases and it always amazes me that they put out such quality products at a price far less than their competitors. Right now you can order this set for $8.99 brand-new from Amazon; that's $1.13 per film!!! A great deal! Again, the quality of these films is fantastic and it genuinely seems that whoever is mastering these sets has a real love for the genre; the transfers are great and there is always the surprising extra, for example, Van Nuys Blvd has a wonderful commentary track by the film's director, William Sachs.

If you are a life-long fan of drive-in/exploitation films or are someone who wants to know what it was all about, this collection provides a nice variety (teen, biker, beach party and horror) in the spectrum of classic cult cinema at an extremely affordable price.",1224115200,59,1503,4.913385826771654

1835204,2,B00008DDI6,"What a strange trip its been...well at least for these actors who obviously never took an acting class! As ""amateur films"" go it ranks in quality of direction with your daughter's fourth grade play (no offense parents), but watching the film is a sort of weird, perverse pleasure.  We see heroin addiction among the rich, wealthy middle-aged men falling prey to teenage Lolitas, 70's nudity ""a naturale,"" and a lame Hollywood excuse for promoting the smoking of pot.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film because the story never seems to flag and moves at a fast clip.  The ending is melodramatic and as what you would expect.  Supporting cast are more credible the leads in this one. George E. Carey should have stuck behind the camera--not in front of it. The female lead, Candy (Susan Romen) is sweet, but rather dull.  Not surprisingly, IMBD lists this film as her one and only film role. My ex-girlfriend liked it...then again, she has no real sense of artistic taste. But don't be too disappointed with the film.",1114646400,,1013,4.7988505747126435
1835205,4,B00008DDI6,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised.  Although this may be a B movie, I think that many people may like it.  Susan Roman plays Candy, a character that takes your heart away.  She comes to baby-sit when she is not needed, because the mother, Mona Carlton, is taking too many pills and confusing dates on the calendar.  So, since Candy is not needed, she can leave. If I was the babysitter in that instance, I would not wait for the father, Jim Carlton, to drive the car out of the garage for Mona, I would just leave on the word ""go.""  But Candy is nice enough to stay and read the poorly written script Jim has about people her age.  Candy decides Jim needs a lesson in what it is like to be young in her generation, so she invites him to the club where her friends hang out.
What I liked best about this movie was the scenes with the Japanese motorcycles.  They looked good the way Candy and Jim drove them.  I also liked the way that Candy is so smooth and easy about everything.  Candy just lets life be.  When she wants something, Candy gets it.  But she never forces the situation.  And her friends are all people you would want to hang out with for a while.  I also liked the character of Jim played by George E. Carey.  Jim is always taking life with Candy as an adventure, and he treats Candy like she should be treated.  He kind of reminds me of the guy at the office party that you like but always tells the bad ""one-liners.""  But Jim is so loveable that you don't mind his nerdiness.",1058400000,3,1527,4.195876288659794

The actors seem like mostly locals but you get the occasional Brooklyn accent which is a fair representation of population back then as many NYers were transplanting there at the time. Don't look for authentic drama here. The plots are totally in the realm of fantasy. Young adults going out on adventures and having fun. There are scenes in some of the flicks where young chicks with big boobs will dance topless for ten minutes at a time. If this bothers you, move on.",1409788800,3,669,4.537190082644628

1835345,3,B00008DDI6,"If nothing else, buy this for The Babysitter, one of your few chances to see Patricia Wymer... and by ""few"" I mean she only made three films and briefly appeared in another. None of them great, but she's one of those actresses who the camera loves and probably had far more potential. Plus, it's got lesbian cabana sex. Tell me you don't want to see lesbian cabana sex.

Weekend With The Babysitter was produced and co-written by the same actor who starred in The Babysitter - basically George E Carey was a washed-up, middle-aged actor who wanted more sex scenes with a hot young actress so he made a film and starred in it.  But there are dirt bikes and drugs and a boat and a plane and a wife who can't steer her own car out of the garage, so not a complete loss, I suppose.

I sat through Single Room Furnished so you don't have to. Seriously, don't. sit. through. it.

Van Nuys Boulevard is... sort of like an anthro-history excursion to the late-70s car culture, basically the tail-end of an age of innocence in terms of sex and drugs, before the 80s hit us upside the head. Be patient and stay with it.

Blood Mania. Oh, Blood Mania. If you think a money-hungry sociopathic slut plotting against her own abortionist father sounds interesting, wait until the psychedelia kicks in.

The rest are solid examples of 1970s B-movie trash. Cheerleaders, bikinis, gay bikers, dumb humor... you know the drill.

Three stars because Single Room Furnished and Malibu Beach are taking up space that could have gone to better selections.

Back in those days everybody wanted to be a Hollywood Casting Agent. You needed no experience and just about anyone could say they were one, just to get into the Swing of Hollywood Party scene. Where sexual freedom and drugs had no real potent war against them or sex or needle passed AIDS to hold them back.

Seeing this supposed under age girl (probably really 18 playing younger) as part of the wantabee biker scene was quite common then. There were sleep houses all over Hollywood. Where runaways and derelict types could crash on wall to wall mattresses in bedrooms for free. Buy cheap meals all along Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards. Being a teen then, we'd often just cruise the Boulevard with our mouths all agape as prostitutes on corners and in cars would openly solicit you in wild traffic jams. Where Clubs like The Whiskey and Hullabaloo were packed with under age teens like us and the bands and owners were secretly taking advantage of these young girls, as you caught glimpses now and then, through cracks in the office doors!

We would often pay your door charge in these all ages clubs, then overhear girls and guys both getting propositioned for drugs and sex at the table next to you. This kind of abuse was all too common in the Hollywood Movie and Music scene. Being a suburbanite, living out in the sticks of Orange County, this all was an eye opening experience, that this movie brought back from my memories! .....days I'm glad I didn't get mixed up in!!!

Carey) works for the film industry and is very successful. When Candy reads a script he has laying around, she makes suggestions in keeping with the time. She offers to take Jim out to a club so he can see what is going on with the day's youth, which look, act, and sound pretentious by today's standards.

Meanwhile the wife (Luanne Roberts) is gone for the weekend with their son. As it turns out she is a junky and her dealer is not a nice man and wants something in addition to cash for his payment. The film includes some bad stock music from the era as well as those pretty colors.

1835416,4,B00008DDI6,"In Drive-In Cult Classics Volume 1, the viewer got a collection of trashy but fun dramas which focused on illicit sex and death.  I have not watched Volume 2, which is a set of low-budget horror movies, some of which have even made it to Mystery Science Theater.  Volume 3, however, is a true mish-mash of movies, but are overall pretty fun.  All come from Crown International Pictures, a distributor of cheesy exploitation flicks (with a definite inclination towards gratuitous nudity).

Volume 3 has eight movies on four discs.  On the first disc is The Babysitter and Weekend with the Babysitter, a pair of generally unrelated but similar movies.  Each involves a middle-aged man (played by the same actor in both movies) having a fling with his child's babysitter and in the process getting entangled with crime.  The Babysitter is the only black-and-white movie in the set.

Disc 2 has The Pink Angels and Blood Mania.  Blood Mania is basically a suspense story with a lot of sex and a bit of trippiness.  The Pink Angels is nominally a comedy, but it lacks any real laughs.  It's the story of a gang of gay bikers.  They don't actually do anything with each other, but instead are just an over-the-top collection of gay stereotypes.  Even for those who find this movie likeable will be put off by the ending where things take an abrupt turn.

Things get both better and worse on Disc 3.  Single Room Furnished is a rare Crown attempt to be arty, with an adaptation of a play about the tragic love life of a young woman.  Unfortunately, the movie is too stagy and the acting and writing are subpar, led by Jayne Mansfield in her final role before her death in a car accident.

On the other side of Disc 3 is the first of a threesome of similar movies that continue on Disc 4.  All three are late-`70s teen sex comedies.  Van Nuys Blvd. (on Disc 3) romanticizes the era of cruising down the boulevard every Wednesday night.  The Pom Pom Girls focus on some high school football players and their attempts to woo the title characters.  Malibu Beach takes place mostly on Malibu Beach.  All three are reasonably interchangeable:  I enjoyed Van Nuys Blvd. the best (it seemed to have the most likeable characters), but they're all decent and pieces of cinematic greatness compared to some of the other Crown fare.

Overall, this is another collection of trashy fun; I enjoyed all these films with the exception of Single Room Furnished (more boring than bad) and to a lesser extent, Pink Angels.  There are even a couple extras:  a commentary and a couple movie trailers.  For what these movies are - cheap entertainment - this is a good set to pick up.",1253750400,15,2654,4.627408993576017
1835417,3,B00008DDI6,"This set of 8 movies in a doubledvd style case are by no means cult classics. Perhaps rare and lowbudget but cult films usually have a following or a ""special"" quality that makes them memorable. What we have here is 3 or 4 decent movies with groovy soundtracks- frontal nudity and occassionaly interesting camera work. On this set Blood Mania(great soundtrack and nudity) and The Babysitter were my favorites but the later California Beach movies(Van Nuys Blvd and Malibu Beach) had some nice 70s girls baring it all and a lighthearted comic feel. This whole series of sets- 4 in total are pretty much all the same. You get a couple of decent movies and for the price its hard to complain but i wish they could land some real cult classics like Ilsa- Emanuelle- or Russ Meyer or Roger Corman films. A good way to pass a Sunday night.",1252368000,11,833,4.56
