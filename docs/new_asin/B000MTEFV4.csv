2747353,5,B000MTEFV4,"the James Cagney Signature collection, is a great way to introduce Cagney's non gangster films to a new generation of film fans.
 Most people only know of his tough guy/gangster films. Such as White Heat
the Public Enemy. or ""G""Men.
But Jimmy Cagney was such a versitile actor. That he could and did play
other type of people. Singers, dancers, circus performers. young lover,
soilder, admirals and the hardest role of all, playing another actor.
As he did in ""Man of a Thousand Faces"". But his best role to me, was in
the movie ""The Gallent Hours"". When he played Admiral William F. Halsey.
 This was his best role as the couragous commander of the Pacific Fleet during
the middle phase of WW2.
 I am hoping for a seconed Signature Collection that includ these last two films.
 As well as some of his later work during late fifties and early sixies.
Before he retired.",1205193600,2,869,4.623376623376624
2747354,5,B000MTEFV4,"I agree with most of the comments by cody jarret and calvinnme.  I would have preferred ""Strawberry Blonde"" and ""Oklahoma Kid"" over ""Fighting 69th"" and ""Bride Came COD"".  Let's hope for a second volume PLUS a couple of sets of early 30s Cagney films.  There are plenty to choose from.

And I love the slim cases.",1187827200,,312,4.517857142857143
2747355,5,B000MTEFV4,"I'm a serious collector of movies.

I highly recommend this collection.",1183161600,10,240,5.2894736842105265
2747356,5,B000MTEFV4,"Cagney from a bygone Hollywood era appears asgeless and timeless in this series. J.C. was one of the movies all time greats and this Cagney series is what Hollywood should be producing today. Cagney,Stewart. Wayne, Fonda (Henry that is ) and Bogart knew how to make movies that pleased their audiences. This Cagney series is a collectors treasure that every move buff will want to have in their collecton. This is a buy, AND HOW !!!!!!!",1179792000,2,436,4.75
2747357,4,B000MTEFV4,"I'm happy enough with this collection, but this is not the top tier of Cagney films. The best of the bunch is ""The Fighting 69th"" and ""Torrid Zone"", which just happens to feature the on-screen rapport of Cagney and Pat O'Brien. ""Captains of the Clouds"" is a good enough if uneven film with a very good performance by Cagney taking his tough-guy persona into war. ""The Bride Came C.O.D."" and ""West Point Story"" would be pretty forgettable story-wise if it were not for Cagney's performances. ""West Point Story"" is actually a musical. With the exception of ""West Point Story"", these films were all made around 1940, which doesn't give you as good a view of Cagney's evolution as an actor as this set could have if the selection had come from the full twenty year plus period that Cagney was making films now under the control of Warner Home Video.

The problem is, as others have mentioned, that many of Cagney's best known films controlled by Warner Brothers are already boxed up in The Warner Gangsters, Warner Legends, Tough Guys, and even the Busby Berkeley (Footlight Parade) and Henry Fonda Signature (Mr. Roberts) collections. However, there are many great Cagney titles that I'm pretty sure Warner Bros. still has the DVD rights to that we haven't seen yet. Among the ones I'm looking for are Cagney's pre-codes including ""Blonde Crazy"", ""Picture Snatcher"", and ""Taxi!"". ""Picture Snatcher"" and ""Taxi!"" aren't even on VHS. From the 1950's Warner Bros. controls the rights to ""Come Fill the Cup"" and ""These Wilder Years"", neither of which are on VHS, but are great showcases of Cagney's talent in more mature roles. Warner Bros. also controls the already mentioned and essential ""Oklahoma Kid"" and ""Strawberry Blonde"". The only thing I can figure is that (a) The pre-codes are perhaps going to be part of the next planned ""Forbidden Hollywood"" collection and/or (b) there is a volume two of Cagney's films planned. I just hope that in the case of Cagney films put on DVD by Warner Home Video in the future that commentary is included. The lack of it in this set is really my chief complaint.

In summary, if you are a Cagney completist, then by all means get this set. If you are looking for more definitive Cagney films and a better introduction to the actor's work, then start with the Warner Gangsters and then the Tough Guy collections.",1179619200,17,2344,4.785185185185185
2747358,4,B000MTEFV4,A nice collection of James Cagney movies that promotes support for our troops during the early wars.  Not his typical gangster movie.  A nice change.,1179014400,3,149,4.92
2747359,3,B000MTEFV4,"I like the movies that are included, but I've seen them before on TCM. I don't really care about vintage short subjects. I wish there were more current special features like current documentaries about the movies that are in the set or commentaries on the movies. That was why when selecting a box set to purchase this month, I got the Tyrone Power set since he is another of my favorite actors.",1178496000,2,395,4.5
2747360,4,B000MTEFV4,"This set is fine as far as it goes.  However, where are THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE and THE OKLAHOMA KID?

Warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets.  Why not Cagney?

On the other hand, maybe a CAGNEY, VOLUME 2 is in the works.

Let's hope so.",1172102400,5,244,4.0
2747361,5,B000MTEFV4,"After the successful release of the Warner Bros Gangster Collection and then the Tough Guys Collection we now have a collection of 'just Cagney' films on their way. A brief description of each film:

Torrid Zone -

Banana Company executive Steve Case on a Caribean plantation group tries to convince his former co-worker Nick Butler to take over the plantation No 7. But he is on his way to Chicago, to take over a job as a manager for another company himself. He has also troubles with US night-club singer Lee Donley, whom he wants aboard a ship back to the US, and rebel Rosario. He is able to get Nick to the plantation, but is he able to keep him there or will he leave it in a few days with Gloria, the wife of the former exectutive of No 7, Mr. Anderson ?

The Fighting 69th -

""The Fighting 69th"" is a First World War regiment of mostly New York-Irish soldiers. Amongst a cocky crew, perhaps the cockiest is Jerry Plunkett, a scrappy fellow who looks out only for himself. The officers and non-coms of the regiment do their best to instill discipline in Plunkett, and the chaplain, Father Duffy, tries to make Plunkett see the greater good, all to no avail. Behind the lines or in the trenches, Plunkett acts selfishly and cowardly, eventually costing the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. A final act of cowardice leads to terrible consequences, but Plunkett sees in them a chance to redeem himself...if only he can.

The West Point Story -

Broadway director Bix Bixby, down on his luck (thanks to gambling), is reluctantly persuaded to go to West Point military academy (with Eve, his gorgeous assistant and on-and-off love) to help the students put on a show. Ulterior motive: to recruit student star Tom Fletcher for Harry Eberhart's new production (Eberhart just happens to be Tom's uncle). Then, Bixby finds that he himself must live as a cadet. Of course, sundered hearts come into the story also...

Captain of the Clouds -

Brian McLean is a ruthless bush-pilot in Canada. He offers some other pilots an opportunity of earning a lot of money, but he marries the girl-friend of one of them. After listening to Churchill's famous ""Blood, Sweat and tears"" radio address he and some other pilots decide to join the RCAF - and his superior is always the pilot who's girlfriend he has married. Due to this and the fact, that McLean doesn't like to obey he gets troubles.

The Bride Came C.O.D. -

Oil heiress Joan (Bette Davis) is going to elope with bandleader Allen whom she's known four days. Out-of-money pilot Steve is going to fly them to Nevada but makes a deal with her father to deliver her home unmarried. He flies off with her, an apparent kidnaping, but is forced down in the desert. The bandleader arrives with a preacher, but their marriage (in California, not Nevada) is not valid. Pilot Steve will marry her because her father is a millionaire.

Here's hoping we find as many interesting and relevant extra features on this set as we've now come to expect from the Signature Collections.",1171238400,37,3019,4.634831460674158

2747384,4,B000MTEFV4,"The James Cagney Collection features some of Jimmy`s most popular films of the day. They do NOT make them like this anymore. Firstly there is the fact that all the big studios,like Warners here,had vast pools of talent from which to draw from whenever they were needed(one of the pluses of the ""studio system"").The bigger stars had to be multi talented. Look at Cagney,a great actor,a passable singer but a fine dancer. Secondly,it seemed no matter what subject matter the film`s covered,if you liked its stars,the plot never mattered. Cagney's audiences loved the persona he so carefully developed over the years. There are some themes in these films,on first glance,that I did`t care for. But Cagney and company bring something to the table that makes each and every one of these enjoyable.
The Bride came COD(released July/41)has Cagney as a charter pilot in California. Bette Davis is a rich girl who is going to marry Jack Carson on a whim. Her father Eugene Pallette makes arrangements with Cagney to ""kidnap"" his daughter and arranges to meet them in Amarillo,Tx. Of course the plane never makes it and the course of true love goes slightly awry. This a funny screwball type of comedy and Cagney and Davis make for an unlikely pairing. 3 1/2-4 stars.
Captains of the Clouds(released Feb/42)has Cagney,Alan Hale Sr.,Dennis Morgan,George Tobias and Reginald Gardiner as bush pilots in the Canadian wilderness. Cagney is at first the outcast as he is stealing everyone's business by undercutting the others rates. However they soon become fast friends,but Cagney marries Morgan's girl in order to save him from her dashing Morgan's dreams. They go on the outs,of course,and eventually they all join the RCAF.However they are all too old and they can only instruct,not fight overseas as they want. Cagney and Hale wash out but Cagney comes back later as a civilian transporter,helping to ferry planes to Britain. On the way the group of five planes is jumped by a German,and Cagney heroically takes it down over the Atlantic. Warners really spent more than the usual amount of time for a Hollywood picture creating some authenticity for this film. They visit actual war time RCAF(Royal Canadian Air Force) training bases in Ontario at Uplands(near Ottawa),Jarvis(SW Ontario)and Trenton(still an active air base near Belleville).The flying buffs will see some old DeHavillands and plenty of Harvard trainers in evidence. You also see a war time Ottawa from the Parliament buildings,the veterans memorial and the Chateau Laurier Hotel. Topping even this is legendary Billy Bishop himself presiding over an actual graduating class of pilots. He gives a short speech and talks with a Canadian,an Aussie and an American volunteer.
A solid 4 stars here.
The Fighting 69th(released Jan/40)has Cagney as a volunteer in the American 69th Division of WW1. He is a wisecracking tough,who becomes ostracized from most of his fellow soldiers very quickly. His only friend is Pat O'Brien who plays the company priest. When Cagney gets his chance on the front lines his toughness goes out the window and he becomes a coward,getting many men killed. He is to be shot at sunrise but a heavy bombing gets him released by the good Father. Instead of fleeing he goes right to the front and dies heroically saving his men. This film was Cagney sending a message to his fans that being tough wasn't always what it cracked up to be. 3 1/2 - 4 stars.
Torrid Zone(released May/40)has O'Brien as a gruff boss on a banana plantation in Central America. Cagney is his underling who runs a part of the operations but is threatening to leave. George Tobias is along as a local bandito,and a more affable bandit you have never seen. Thrown into the mix is lovely Ann Sheridan who arrives to get a job at a local bar and who ends up in the end as Cagney's beau,with Cagney back on the plantation better than ever. This film I found to be the most enjoyable out of all the films. The interplay the actors,the light touch of the story and the chemistry between all of them added up to a winner. 4-4 1/2 stars.
Finally we have The West Point Story(released Dec/50),which has Cagney and Virginia Mayo as a stage director and his assistant,down on their luck. His old boss,who blackballed him,offers him a job to direct a show at West Point. The motive is for Cagney to try and talk his old bosses nephew Gordon McCrae,who is a good singer,into leaving the academy. Cagney agrees and even gets one of his finds,now a star,Doris Day,to come and perform in the show. But Day and McCrae fall in love and McCrae wants to stay in the academy more than anything. I found this one the least appealing of them all,but it gave a young Doris day to a chance to shine vocally and Cagney was able to demonstrate some more of his terpsichorean finesse. 3 -3 1/2 stars.
Technically speaking all the films are in pretty good condition considering their ages. They all contain the Warner Night at the Movies features,which tries to simulate the movie experience of those by gone days with cartoons,newsreels and shorts. I have tried a couple of theses sets and I found both had glitches in them. Canadian Amazon still has this set for a high price but Amazon in the U.S. has it at a startling low price. It may be because of the issues with the discs that I found. The glitches in question are stoppages in ALL the films at various points. Some lasted a second or two,but the worst was in West Point,where the picture stops/freezes during the Military Polka number. It lasted so long I didn't know whether it was going to continue on. I examined the discs in both sets thoroughly and both to a disc were as pristine as a baby's butt. So it is obviously a technical/production run issue. This is an unfortunate but preventable thing that should have been caught by the company's quality control. Unusual for a company like this.
All in all a set that any Cagney fan,or lover of films from the good old days,will love. Cagney is right in his persona at all times and always ""brings it"" each and every time. The drawback to this five film set is the terrible technical glitches which freeze/temporarily stop just about all the films on these discs at various points. One star deducted.",1354147200,,6232,4.776645041705283
2747385,4,B000MTEFV4,"This was ordered by mistake, but we watched it and found the films enjoyable.  Having never seen a Cagney film, I was aware of him only as a punch line. The studio system of the era probably did not utilize his talents optimally, but he did some fine acting nonetheless. I will seek out some of his better known films and watch his Oscar winning performance in Yankee Doodle Dandy.",1345507200,2,381,4.442857142857143
2747386,5,B000MTEFV4,"James Cagney just might be the original ""macho"" man! He was short in stature but huge in personality and that certain something that made him stand out from the crowd. Modern day actors should study him and how he tackled a role because he was always the most entertaining as well as the sexiest man in a film. This box set includes some of his best work and at a bargain price I highly recommend it!",1331596800,,400,4.276315789473684
2747387,5,B000MTEFV4,"As an advid Classic Movie lover, this is a excellent addition to my movie collection.  There are many Classic actors and actresses and James Cagney has always been one of my favorite actors.",1329350400,,190,4.757575757575758
2747388,5,B000MTEFV4,"I bought this set from Amazon.co.uk after seeing James Cagney in the 1975 documentary film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-Can-You-Spare-a-Dime/dp/6305609276/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?</a>&nbsp;, and becoming intrigued, having seen little of his work. I now understand why Cagney is considered a great. A fantastic set of films showcasing James Cagney's (and others) impecable acting talents. All the films were Warner Brother's productions. All films are in black and white. As others have also covered this set very well, I have provided the following information, most of which comes from Wikipedia.

Public Enemy (1931)
Cagney's breakthrough movie. Contains the famous scene where Cagneys character (Tom Powers) forces a grapefruit into his girlfriend's face (Kitty, played by Mae Clarke). This scene is viewed by many critics as one of the most famous moments in movie history. The film cost only $151,000 to make, but it became one of the first low budget films to gross $1 million.

The Roaring Twenties (1939)
The Roaring Twenties was the last film that James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart made together. The movie is hailed as a classic in the gangster movie genre, and considered an ""homage"" to the classic gangster movie of the early 1930s. In 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. In 2009 Empire Magazine named it #1 in a poll of the 20 Greatest Gangster Movies You've (Probably) Never Seen.

The Fighting 69th (1940)
""The Fighting 69th"" is a First World War regiment of mostly New York-Irish soldiers. Amongst a cocky crew, perhaps the cockiest is Jerry Plunkett, a scrappy fellow who looks out only for himself. The officers and non-coms of the regiment do their best to instill discipline in Plunkett, and the chaplain, Father Duffy, tries to make Plunkett see the greater good, all to no avail. Behind the lines or in the trenches, Plunkett acts selfishly and cowardly, eventually costing the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. A final act of cowardice leads to terrible consequences, but Plunkett sees in them a chance to redeem himself ... if only he can.

Actual archived war combat footage was used in the film, as well as footage of soldiers marching through the Arch of Triumph.

The Torrid Zone (1940)
THe Torrid Zone is a 1940 adventure film starring James Cagney, Ann Sheridan and Pat O'Brien. Steve Case (Pat O'Brien) has to deal with trouble at his tropical fruit company's Central American banana plantation. A revolutionary, Rosario La Mata (George Tobias), is stirring up unrest among the workers, and the only man who can handle the situation, foreman Nick Butler (James Cagney), has just quit. Steve manages to persuade Nick to stick around (for a big bonus). Adding to the complications is Lee Donley (Ann Sheridan), a woman who Steve has ordered out of the region for causing a different kind of trouble among the men.

The Bride Came C.O.D. (1941)
Screwball romantic comedy starring James Cagney as a pilot and Bette Davis as a runaway heiress. This film was publicized as the first movie pairing of Warner Bros. two biggest stars, although they had actually made ""Jimmy the Gent"" together in 1934.

Pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney) agrees to help bandleader Alan Brice (Jack Carson) and heiress Joan Winfield (Bette Davis) elope. Steve then contacts her father Lucius (Eugene Pallette), offering to prevent the marriage and deliver her to him in return for enough money to get out of debt.

Steve tricks Alan into getting off the plane, then takes off with Joan. When an irate Joan tries to jump out of the plane, Steve sees that she has her parachute on backwards and is forced to crash land near the ghost town of Bonanza. The next morning, they encounter the lone resident, Pop Tolliver (Harry Davenport). Joan escapes into an abandoned mine. When Steve follows her, they are trapped by a cave-in. Steve finds a way out, but hides it from Joan on the advice of Pop. Believing that they are going to die, Joan re-examines her frivolous life with great regret. Steve admits he loves her, but when he kisses her, she tastes food on his lips and realizes he has found a way out. They exit the mine to find that Alan has tracked them down, accompanied by a Nevada judge.

Steve does not object when Alan and Joan get married, hiding the fact that Bonanza is in California and therefore the wedding is invalid. The ""newlyweds"" board another plane, but when Joan figures out that they are not really married, she ... well, I won't spoil it for you!

White Heat (1949)
The film is considered one of the classic gangster films and was added to the United States National Film Registry in 2003 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress. Critical reaction to the film was positive, and today it is considered a classic. White Heat was listed in Time magazine's top 100 films of all time. In June 2008, the American Film Institute released its ""Ten Top Ten"" list - the best ten films in ten ""classic"" American film genres - after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. White Heat was acknowledged as the fourth best in the gangster film genre. Also, the quote; ""Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"" was number 18 on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest movie quotes.

West Point Story (1950)
The West Point Story (also known as Fine and Dandy) is a 1950 musical comedy film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring James Cagney, Virginia Mayo and Doris Day. The film received two award nominations in 1951. Ray Heindorf was nominated for a Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and John Monks Jr., Charles Hoffman and Irving Wallace were nominated for a Writers Guild of America award for Best Written American Musical.

It was just well done in every regard.  thanks!",1270771200,,304,4.592592592592593
2747390,5,B000MTEFV4,"I'm a huge Cagney fan and admittedly, I prefer him in the gangster-type roles he does best. However, this collection gives us the Cagney performances that aren't as well-known but are more examples of his versatility. The best movie in this bunch is ""The Bridge Came COD"" with Bette Davis. It's charming and funny because both of them have such strong personalities, it's very amusing to watch them fight. There aren't many actors that can upstage Cagney like Bette Davis. ""The Fighting 69th"" and ""Torrid Zone"" are also well-done as is ""West Point Story,"" which gives Cagney an opportunity to show off his singing and dancing skills. The weakest film in this collection is 'Captains of the Clouds'--a film that takes a bit too long to develop and mostly honors and promotes the Canadian Air Force. All in all, this is but a glimpse into Cagney's pocket of tricks and skills that made him one of the best, most well-rounded actors.",1257897600,2,930,4.782608695652174
2747391,4,B000MTEFV4,"James Cagney burst on the scene in the 1930s and very quickly proved his ability to menace or charm at the drop of a hat. An undersized powderkeg gifted with fast-talking blarney and nimble swagger, dude certainly made plenty of bank for Warner Brothers studios even as he quickly became typecast into those tough guy parts. It's a bit of a nudge in the ribs for me that this DVD set is titled JAMES CAGNEY: THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION, because the collected cinema here aren't by any means considered his most celebrated movies (those would be THE PUBLIC ENEMY, ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, WHITE HEAT, and YANKEE DOODLE DANDY). But the five films offered here do serve to demonstrate the man's range beyond starring in gangster dramas. These films span a decade, from 1940 to 1950. TORRID ZONE (1940), THE BRIDE CAME C.O.D. (1941), and THE WEST POINT STORY (1950) present the lighter and even musical side of James Cagney. Meanwhile THE FIGHTING 69TH (1940) and CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS (1942) feature him in wartime dramas, with THE FIGHTING 69TH casting Cagney against type as a craven American soldier. Each film is featured on its own disc, with this set I think overall meriting four out of five stars.

A few years ago I saw Cagney and Bette Davis co-star in 1934's terrific JIMMY THE GENT on the TCM network, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on THE BRIDE CAME C.O.D. once I learned that it reunited these two actors on screen (alas, for the second and final time). While this one isn't quite up there in the timeless classics category, it's still a fine screwball comedy, with Cagney's charter pilot brokering a deal with a Texas oil magnate to kidnap his flighty daughter (Davis) to prevent her from eloping. Cagney and Davis are two magnificent fireball personalities, and it's insane fun watching the two wage war with snappy banter and attempt to one-up each other with oodles of that domineering attitude. Oh, but check that, there's a chance that these two volatile actors might actually have elevated the dialogue, rather than it being all that snappy. And so what if Bette Davis looks a bit older than her 23-year-old character? She's still lovely. Madcap goings-on all around, in tiny, horrifyingly clunky charter planes and in desert ghost towns and mine shafts and with Davis's backside several times being introduced to sharp, sharp cacti. Love - and aggrieved snootiness - are in the air, and Cagney gets smacked around by Bette Davis... and Jack Carson. It's all improbable stuff, but what's not to like?

Special Features for THE BRIDE CAME C.O.D.: a vintage newsreel (Easter Parade preview, focusing on women's fashionable wear); the musical shorts ""Carnival of Rhythm"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Forty Boys and a Song""; two cartoons ""Porky's Pooch"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Rhapsody in Rivets""; trailers for THE BRIDE CAME C.O.D. and 1941's HONEYMOON FOR THREE.

TORRID ZONE is a neat action comedy and Cagney's eight film with Pat O'Brien, his pal in real life and perennial movie wingman. The story takes place in some unnamed perhaps Latin American country and revolves around a despotic general manager of a banana company, the brash foreman he rehires to salvage his floundering banana plantation, and the beautiful fugitive (and card cheat) who sashays into their lives. If you like them movies featuring Americans wisecracking and fighting and falling in love in sweaty tropical places, then let TORRID ZONE hook you up.

Sharp performances liven things up. Cagney does his James Cagney thing, and this time sporting a rare thin mustache. Pat O'Brien, who really is an accomplished actor, this time comes in as Steve Case, the general manager who is such a pushy heel that he is told: ""Mister, the stork that brought you must've been a vulture."" Ann Sheridan makes big noise as sassy chanteuse Lee Donley, and here she does her best Bacall impersonation from TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. She and Cagney display crackling chemistry, and their zingers fly fast and furious, joined at times by a very game O'Brien. The central romance does take a detour when a reedy, unhappily wedded femme fatale (Helen Vinson) darkens the picture. And, for fans of Superman, keep an eye out for a cameo by George Reeves as a Latin outlaw henchman.

It isn't all comedy and romance. In ramrodding the banana plantation Nick Butler (Cagney) ends up tangling with an escaped bandit and his henchmen. But you never really get the feeling that things will ever get that desperate. The escaped bandit, as it turns out, is too good natured. The vacuous chief of police, too much of a bumbler and relegated too much to being the brunt of jokes to ever take seriously. In the end, O'Brien convinces Cagney to hang around as foreman, Cagney gets the girl, and in that final clinch, he tells her: ""You and your 14-karat oomph."" I'm not sure if this is where Sheridan garnered the nickname of ""the Oomph Girl"" (I know Warner Bros. gave it to her) but, brother, she sure did openly detest being called that. It's the price of fame, baby.

Special Features for TORRID ZONE: a vintage newsreel (Uncle Sam Wants You); the musical short ""Ozzie Nelson and His Orchestra""; the historical short ""Pony Express Days"" starring George Reeves as Buffalo Bill Cody (19 minutes long); the classic Oscar-nominated Bugs Bunny cartoon ""A Wild Hare""; trailers for TORRID ZONE and SANTA FE TRAIL.

Go get your patriotism on with 1940's gritty war drama THE FIGHTING 69TH, the seventh of nine films to co-star Cagney and Pat O'Brien. Cagney plays mouthy misfit Jerry Plunkett, newly enlisted in the Irish-American World War I regiment, the Fighting 69th (165th Infantry, A.E.F.). Plunkett, disliked by the other men in his regiment, brags that he can't wait to get at the Fritz and earn fame and medals. And, yet, when he finally ends up in the trenches, he blinks. The disgraced Plunkett, a shirker of work and now a firm coward, draws inspiration and learns the true face of courage from the Fighting 69th's supportive chaplain Father Francis Duffy. But when a chance surfaces for him to do the right thing, will Plunkett once more scurry away?

Running at an hour and a half, THE FIGHTING 69TH does a good job of exploring life at Camp Mills as the newbies of the 69th get trained and prepped for the big tussle overseas. The film's first half is top heavy with brawny humor consisting of good natured ribbing and roughhousing. It even features an all-inclusive brawl between the 69th and the 4th Alabama, these two regiments apparently having been on opposite sides of the Civil War. The film then follows the 69th overseas as the regiment finally joins the war, and this is where things turn on the grim, and where the film audiences witnesses the shocking reveal point of Plunkett's character. The fallout of his cowardice tallies such a dear cost that I wasn't certain the guy could ever fully redeem himself. Cagney and Pat O'Brien are really excellent, O'Brien rock steady as the understanding Father Duffy and Cagney riveting and chewing the scenery like it was pizza and beer (not that you chew beer). Also co-starring familiar faces George Brent, Alan Hale, Dennis Morgan, and Frank McHugh. After all this time, I'm still checking to make sure my collar is buttoned.

Special Features for THE FIGHTING 69TH: a vintage newsreel about the U.S. Navy; two patriotic shorts ""Young America Flies"" and the Oscar-nominated ""London Can Take It!""; two cartoons ""Pilgrim Porky"" and ""The Fighting 69 1/2th""; an audio-only bonus: from the Lux Radio Theater, the 4/6/1942 radio adaptation (58 minutes long, and a very cool listen) of THE FIGHTING 69TH starring Pat O'Brien as Father Duffy, Robert Preston as Plunkett, and Ralph Bellamy; trailers for THE FIGHTING 69TH and BROTHER ORCHID.

Of all the pictures on this set, CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS is the only one in glorious Technicolor, the other films having been shot in black & white. On a more lofty scale, CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS was one of the first war-themed pictures to emerge right after America threw its hat in in World War II, so there's a certain sentimental cachet attached, even if this film was all about the Canadian war effort. James Cagney and Dennis Morgan play hardy bush aviators who take their skills to the Royal Canadian Air Force during the early days of World War II. Michael Curtiz helms the picture, just before he would direct YANKEE DOODLE DANDY and help James Cagney to a Best Actor's Academy Award in that movie.

Cagney channels his cocky cinema persona into brash bush pilot Brian MacLean. We first meet him in the Canadian wilds, gleefully underpricing the competition and unveiling a certain weasely charm as he romances beautiful Brenda Marshall away from Dennis Morgan. And, so, for Cagney and Morgan's characters, the feud is full on, translating from their civilian lives and into their stints in the RCAF. But for MacLean, his independence and pure cussedness don't serve him well in the military and he washes out. But, in these types of films, redemption is always just around the corner.

So this movie isn't as much a war picture as much as it is a war preparedness picture. It's a lot dated now, but the big draw back then were the aerial maneuvers shot for the film. The personal dramas are routinely conveyed, although as ever Cagney brings it as an actor and Brenda Marshall has never been more stunning. This is a good movie, but not my favorite in this collection.

Special Features for CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS: a vintage newsreel (James Cagney reads a message regarding war bonds from Secretary Morgenthau); the sports short ""Rocky Mountain Big Game""; the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons ""Fresh Hare"" and ""What's Cookin', Doc?""; and trailers for CAPTAIN OF THE CLOUDS and IN THIS OUR LIFE.

For those who only knew Cagney for being all gangstery, it must be a jarring startlement to see him croon and tap dance and cavort musically, but fact of the matter is that Cags is a capable song and dance dude. Cagney never did make too many musical films, our loss. Off the top of my head, he did YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, FOOTLIGHT PARADE, and this one. Eight years after playing George M. Cohan, he once more forces his aging dogs in tap shoes, this time as Elwin ""Bix"" Bixby, a struggling, headstrong Broadway musical producer hampered with a gambling addiction. He gets tapped to whip into shape West Point Academy's annual music revue, except that instead of doing this for love of country, Bix is aiming to parlay the show into Broadway and back into big time. Y'see, Bixby ain't too classy a gent.

THE WEST POINT STORY is clearly one of those ""Hey, let's put on a show"" shows, and it works on the strength of its songs, fine humor at Cagney's expense (he's forced into being a cadet), and sheer star power. Cagney is joined by Virginia Mayo as Bixby's long-suffering assistant/girlfriend, and she gets a chance to show off her singing and dancing, along with her looks. Gordon MacRae is the upright cadet whose strong singing voice Bixby longs to steal away to Broadway. Doris Day enters as the sweet movie star who, if Bix schemes it right, will tempt the cadet away from his beloved West Point and into show business. The songs are solid, although ""Military Polka"" and ""Kissin' Rock"" don't quite qualify as classic standards. Gene Nelson does some nifty dancing. Alan Hale Jr. threatens us with playing the ""Princess"" part for the West Point stage show.

But it's all about Cagney, who really hams it up. He bristles with energy, especially in those scenes in which he erupts into violent tantrums during rehearsals. Throughout the film Cagney gets to perform his stiff-legged dance stylings and, as always, he half sings, half speaks his lyrics. He has a big song and dance number in the end called ""B'klyn,"" and just in case you missed the cue, the cast then hits the stage for a curtain call to belt out ""This is the finale - the end!"" A good time was had by me, a sentiment that applies to all the movies in this collection.

Special Features for THE WEST POINT STORY: a vintage newsreel about the evils of imperialistic communism; the Oscar-winning Sports Parade short ""Granddad of Races""; a Daffy Duck cartoon ""His Bitter Half""; and trailers for THE WEST POINT STORY and TEA FOR TWO.

James Cagney began as a dancer but turned into an actor in gangster movies as a tough guy in many 1930 movies (The Roaring Twenties). These five movies present a sample of his talents in comedy, drama, war adventures, and musicals. I think he was also in a western movie too.

The Bride Came C.O.D. (1941) is a comedy where an airplane pilot delivers a missing heiress to her father. What can go wrong?

Captains of the Clouds (1942) tells about bush pilots who join the Royal Canadian Air Force and are assigned to fly bombers to England for the war effort.

The Fighting 69th (1940) is a drama about the doughboys of WW I. It was also a preparedness movie (like They Died With Their Boots On).

Torrid Zone (1940) is a romantic drama set in Central America (banana republic). There is a rivalry between two men for a singer.

The West Point Story (1950) is a musical comedy set in West Point, NY. Can the talent be used in a Broadway show?
