8603827,5,B00ECHSYEG,"The, supposedly, final film of Michael Legge deals with the Hollow Earth theory. But it is not theory. A couple are planning a family get together when bizarre things start happening in their home. They are invaded by travelers from the center of the world! Now they have to figure out how to deal with this new and bizarre life form and the people from the center of the Earth have to deal with life on the surface.  It's conspiracy theory meets outright slap stick comedy and it is laugh out loud funny.
I have decided that this can not be the last Legge film. They are all so much fun it watch. I must have more of them.",1520208000,,623,4.235294117647059
8603828,5,B00ECHSYEG,"MONOCHROMIA is Director Michael Legge's 13th film to be released on DVD...and it's by no means un unlucky number!

For those of you familiar with Legge's work, you know that he and his very talented cast members have the ability to take the most insane of situations
and make them even crazier...and funnier! For those of you who aren't familiar with their work, what are you waiting for? The man's done 13 films already-
you need to get caught up!

The story deals with a Government experiment gone wrong, which releases into the atmosphere a gas that renders the world's population totally color blind. A scientist
manages to come up with a cure on paper, but his notes are stolen by a pair of Bonnie & Clyde wannabes who give gangsters AND slapstick a new name. They've only gotten
part of the formula though...and they have to put their heads together ( hopefully without injury) to find the missing piece!

Legge has said that he thinks of his films as taking place in their own world, and so the rules of logic and order simply don't apply. If there's any truth to there being an afterlife & if I have a choice, that's the world I want to go to, because it sure looks like everyone's having fun there!

MONOCHROMIA...it has to be seen to be enjoyed!",1376092800,3,1255,4.515418502202643
