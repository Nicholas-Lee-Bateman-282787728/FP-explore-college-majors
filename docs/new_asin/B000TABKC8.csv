8208371,5,B000TABKC8,I love pilates and nobody does it as well as Mari Winsor.  I upgraded to dvd but the vhs was a great price.,1355184000,,107,3.652173913043478
8208372,5,B000TABKC8,"i bought myself the winsor pilates series a few years ago. my daughter kept borrowing it, so i bought another one! we both very thoroughly enjoy pilates and even more, we love the results!",1316304000,,188,4.5588235294117645
8208373,5,B000TABKC8,I used to do the winsor pilates years ago when they first came out.. I think it was like 2004 or 2005. Doing these tapes was the only time in my life that i ever actually lost weight. I just wished i would have stuck with it back then. These tapes really work. Well i can't speak for all of the tapes.. but the accelerated body sculpting is amazing. But i think i want to interchange all of the other tapes that come in the set.  I suggest adding cardio directly after doing the tape. The weight just melted off... and my booty started lifting!! :-)))) I just hope it works for me like it did back then. I also think the reason the weight melted off was because i used to go walking/jogging right after i did the tape.. and the pilates helped my joints so i was able to walk and run a lot longer then i was usually able to. I can't wait for these tapes to come.. so i can get off my big butt.,1307232000,2,892,3.983240223463687
8208374,5,B000TABKC8,"This is an old set but still so effective. I have a new body and loving it. This is great when you are in the process of losing and need to tone. My lower back, where my love handles were, look great. The 57 minute tape will get you sweating. The 20 minute abs and 20 minute thighs tapes are great for alternating when you want a qucik workout in the mornings before work. I had no need for the basic instructions. Great set...Love it.",1302220800,2,435,4.129411764705883
8208375,5,B000TABKC8,"Exercise is hard work.  Pilates is not easy.  As long as my remaining VCR holds out, I'll keep trying pilates.  I'm still working on the basics.  The Bun & Thigh Sculpting, Ab Sculpting, and Accelerated Body-Sculpting will have to wait until I'm in better shape.  If you're in good shape and want the Winsor Pilates series cheap, this is the way to go.  But as a former couch potato, I feel well past my prime after a workout.  It's both good and bad.",1266624000,3,451,4.36144578313253
