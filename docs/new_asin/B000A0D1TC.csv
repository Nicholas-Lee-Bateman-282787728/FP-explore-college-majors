8204369,5,B000A0D1TC,"If you are looking for a movie that will change your life forever by showing the same scene over and over again to you over 90 times in the entire series of crappy movies, or watching 20 minutes of credits at the beginning (and the end of the movie).  I cannot begin to describe this monstrosity of a movie, but since it has Josh Kirby in it, it gets 5 stars.

Buy this for your mentally retarded child.",1180742400,7,403,4.153846153846154
