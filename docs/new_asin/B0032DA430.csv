8387426,4,B0032DA430,"Very good storyline with plenty of action, and along with good friends, there are some powerful adversaries. I've watched it twice through so far. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I've seen other shows that would rank higher, in my opinion.
Keep in mind, this is only subtitled. But in a way, that made it even better.",1442188800,,329,4.409836065573771
8387427,4,B0032DA430,"I wanted to start watching Anime again and started with the Yozakura Quartet. I seen some clips on YouTube and the series looks really awesome. I've only got to one episode so far, the series started off with some action. The DVD came in great condition and it works. I would order from Section23 Films again.",1399680000,,309,4.535714285714286
8387428,4,B0032DA430,"This is a nice DVD collection of this enjoyable supernatural, action/drama anime series. I decided to give it a shot after watching and enjoying the OVA series a little while back. I was not disappointed. It's definitely worth watching/owning, especially if you liked the OVA series and/or original manga. Anyhow, in this anime, you get a nice mixture of supernatural action, memorable characters/good character development, comedy, and some nicely done emotional parts(drama). The animation quality is pretty good, the soundtrack is very good and effective, and the character designs are good and nice to look at. If you enjoy supernatural anime shows like Yu Yu Hakusho, I would definitely recommend this series to you, although, it is not as nearly over the top with the comedy as in Yu Yu Hakusho. Well, even if you are not a Yu Yu Hakusho fan and just a fan of action/drama anime in general, I would still recommend this series to you.",1332720000,,940,4.918238993710692
8387429,4,B0032DA430,"This is a great anime series! While the pacing is slow sometimes it overall has a fun, fast pace. I am only giving this 4 stars because I feel that there should have included something extra besides the two discs. (where's an insert?!) The extras are minimal and nothing to be astounded by. Overall, the series was intriguing, fast paced and filled with great humor. Expect for minimal twists and turns but to enjoy the action sequences!

I would suggest this series to hard core anime fans who would appreciate a show with magic, fantasy, friendship, humor and action.",1306281600,,569,4.747474747474747
8387430,5,B0032DA430,"This anime is very good, it has intersting characters, and a great story. On the ohter hand, if you readed the manga you might beconfused because they change somethings from the manga, ""minnor spoilers"" like they start the anime when rin bearly getting into town, when in the manga she was already living in the town for the start.  They also rearrange the order of some of the arcs.",1304812800,,383,4.550724637681159
8387431,5,B0032DA430,"Let me start by saying this is one of the more refreshing titles to come out in a long time.

I'll save you the time of reading this review and just tell you right now, BUY THIS ANIME!

What? You're still reading this? Why haven't you pressed the ""Add to Cart"" button yet? Well, whatever the reason may be, this collection will not fail you.

Spread across 2 DVDs are all 12 episodes of this anime. Audio is in Japanese only with English subtitles, though there shouldn't be any concern regarding essays of text to read. The show moves moderately fast but subtitles are very easy to read and understand. For those who hate to read, this isn't bad at all, and it doesn't make for any less of a story!

Unfortunately there aren't any extras that come with the dvd release, something would have been nice but oh well.

Anyway, the story is very basic in its own unique sense. There are 7 pillars spread around Sakurashin town and they must be kept from blooming or else all hell will break loose. The Life Counseling Center, comprised of members Ao, Hime, Kotoha, Akina and Kyousuke, must stop the evil Enjin from doing so. Enjin has been causing all sorts of commotion around town and they have to find a way to defeat him without injuring their dear friend Gin, who has been taken over by the evil Enjin. What will happen to Sakurashin town? You'll have to find out!!

There are many flashy battles throughout the show, including machine guns, dragon spears, exorcism, katanas, and of course bare knuckle boxing!

The opening and ending songs are solid, and the music throughout the show reminds of Fooly Cooly, but don't hold it against me.

For those who have been reading the books, this show will completely destroy your sense of direction! This show was not meant to be linear with the books, this story should be taken differently.

Though i'm sure those who have been following the books will love how the characters come to life in the show.

I know I did!!",1276473600,9,1964,4.538243626062323
