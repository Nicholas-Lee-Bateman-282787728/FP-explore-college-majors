3480872,5,B001B3LIME,"My 2 year old absolutely loves this DVD!  She insists on it being on when she wants to watch a video.  Although I can no longer get any of the songs out of my head, it is truly a great video, with great songs, great celebrity guests.  It is funny for adults who are forced to watch it (at least the first 100 times)!  Compared to other Elmo videos, this one is definitely the best quality, most content & most fun for little ones to watch.  My 6 year old also enjoys it when her little sister insists on watching it AGAIN!  Don't hesitate, this is a great purchase!",1228780800,3,565,4.137614678899083
3480873,3,B001B3LIME,"While I enjoyed several parts of this DVD, it just doesn't feel very cohesive -- either to me or my 2 1/2 year old.  The director seems to cater to the celebrities who do cameos here to such an extent that the storyline tries to function like a sitcom.  The jokes were either stupid or they required an awareness of pop culture that my preschooler just does not have.  ""Stiller the Elf"" (voice of Ben Stiller) is particularly uninspiring, and having Santa wear fingerless black leather gloves and act in very un-Santa-ish ways turned off both me and my kiddo.  I really wish that Kevin Clash (rather than Joey Mazzarino) had produced and directed this one, since he seems to have a much better feel for what parents and their children will be willing watch the fifty or sixty minimal viewings that all Elmo DVDs get.",1228003200,3,816,4.568493150684931
3480874,1,B001B3LIME,"This movie is cute... most of the cameos & songs are good. I don't like some of the dialogue. A couple of times during the movie a character starts talking about the ""elfin' menace"".... Its sounds like hes saying ""f-in menace"".  Another character says something like ""not having a snowballs chance in..."" & another character pipes in & says something before the character says ""hell"". Some parents might not care if their kids talk trashy but I do. Its a shame because if they had left out those comments it would definitely be a keeper.",1227916800,12,537,4.652631578947369
3480875,5,B001B3LIME,I bought two of these movies for my younger grandkids.  Even the older ones like to watch it.  It is a great way to get the little ones into the holiday season.,1227398400,,160,3.96875
3480876,5,B001B3LIME,"We love this DVD. My son is almost 2 and he is a big Elmo fan...he has wanted to watch this at least once every day since we got it. My husband and I really enjoy it as well (although not EVERY day)! The music is wonderful and the scenes are animated well with extremely bright colors; it is a very up to date Sesame Street production, unlike some of the older DVD's. This will definitely be a Christmas tradition in our home :)",1227225600,2,428,4.107142857142857
3480877,4,B001B3LIME,"The story is very good, but my 4 y/o child and I can't give it the 5 stars.

The main audience of this story is supposed to be young children... some jokes, in my opinion, are waaaayyy tooo complicated for the kiddos. I don't like this ""revolutionary"" idea of a Santa who likes rock... the rocker Santa was *not* silly; rather, he was simply corny... and it was supposed to be one of the magical moments of the story. something can be funny and still magical.... but that santa?...hmmmm, nop.

Don't get me wrong, the story is very good and my child liked it (let's say that is lacking something.... it's just  not having the feeling of a classic Christmas story)... but overall, it's OK. I specially liked seeing so many American celebrities singing so many wonderful songs for the story...  but the end is totally messed up... they did a good job putting everything together, so I'll give it 4 stars.",1226707200,2,902,4.549382716049383
3480878,4,B001B3LIME,"My son is almost 2 years old and a huge Elmo fan. We purchased this DVD under a week ago and he's already watched it 6 times! He's requesting it all the time ! The scenes with Anne Hathaway, Alicia Keys and Jamie Foxx are memorable and my husband and I find ourselves singing the songs long after the DVD is over. A must for any Elmo fan. I can see this as a pre-Christmas ritual from now on.",1226102400,9,392,3.9746835443037973
3480879,2,B001B3LIME,"Elmo and Abby are adorable, as usual.  Ben Stiller is really funny and the cameo's are mostly good.  Jennifer Hudson's song was really annoying though.  Just fyi, there is at least one christian song on the movie so if you are looking for something purely secular you might want to take that into consideration-I didn't know that when I bought the dvd.",1225843200,2,352,4.645161290322581

3480963,1,B001B3LIME,We reeeally didn't enjoy this one.  My daughter lost interest in it almost instantly but we kept at it to see if it would become more enjoyable as it went on... it didn't.  There were too many celebrity cameos and not enough focus on the Sesame Street characters and the celeb cameos that were there just weren't that enjoyable.  The ending with Kevin James as Santa Claus was a little ridiculous and definitely not your traditional Santa Claus.  Wish I saved my money and bought a more classic Sesame Street Christmas DVD.  This has more focus on the celebrities than it does on the beloved characters.,1416441600,2,603,4.650943396226415

3480993,1,B001B3LIME,Product was defective. My child is a big Elmo fan and it was frustrating for her not to see it load or freeze in way too many frames. Sad part about it was I live overseas & the return would have cost me about 10 times the price.,1391731200,,229,3.7916666666666665
3481014,5,B001B3LIME,We bought this movie when my now five year old was one (almost two) but we have watched it every year multiple times and she still loves it.  We all sing a long and it now seems to kick off our Christmas.,1389657600,,204,3.857142857142857

Because he loved this one so much, I decided to purchase another Elmo Christmas movie thinking he would have the same response to it as this one and he did not.  The other Elmo/Sesame Street Movie starring Maya Angelou is of almost no interest to him.  He has watched parts of the movie, but won't sit through it like he does for Elmo's Christmas Countdown.

3481081,3,B001B3LIME,"My daughter is a huge Sesame Street fan so it was a no brainer to buy this for her second Christmas.  There are some cute parts and some good music.  Unfortunately there are also some parts that leave a lot to be desired and some of the dialogue is a little above and beyond what they show on the typical Sesame Street episodes.  The celebrities tend to embellish for the sake of performance at times.  Kevin James (as Santa) talking about the cops pulling him over and giving him a ticket is a little much for toddlers.  His song is also terrible.

All in all it is good, and my two year old likes it but there are a few parts that I didn't care for.",1325030400,,651,4.126984126984127

The songs are great, and will get stuck in your head.  The celebrities are fun to see.  I imagine there will be things she will love that will be annoying the millionth time i see it, but this video is not one of them.",1323820800,,344,3.9420289855072466

This is not one of my son's favorites.. it's drawn out and not very entertaining.  However, he really enjoys the Elmo's World - Happy Holidays DVD.  I would recommend it over this Christmas Countdown.",1323129600,3,316,4.625
3481084,5,B001B3LIME,My son is 3 yrs old and loves music. It's a perfect DVD for him. Cute story and X-mas songs performed by well known artists. He laughs and dances while we play it for him. Recommended for little ones.,1322179200,,200,4.153846153846154
3481105,5,B001B3LIME,"My son is 3 now, but we got this last year when he was 2. He loved Elmo then and still loves him now. It's an adorable movie and teaches kids not to give up hope on something that they really believe in. It's a star studded cast but of course the kids don't care about that. Wonderful music too! We watched it again the other day and it's only October!",1318550400,,352,3.971830985915493
3481106,5,B001B3LIME,"This is by far better than the other elmo Xmas movie which we hated and gave one star and highly suggest you avoid. This is however the opposite. It's slightly different then the usual elmo progression which is very nice. It has Abby Cadabby in it as elmo's co-star and has quite a few Christmas songs woven into the story of them trying to save Christmas. They just need to wish upon a Christmas star and have a little faith, which elmo does. The story line is great, the colors and mood are extremely festive. The singers and song choices are excellent. I would say it's probably one of the best kid Christmas dvd's you can get that they, or even you for that matter, will enjoy again and again.",1300060800,2,697,4.369230769230769

3481112,5,B001B3LIME,"My son is 2 and just LOVES this movie. He's learning numbers and it's got music videos between each number that have to do with Christmas. It's a star studded cast. Not that he cares about that part. He has not tired of this movie at all and he's watched it once a day every day for about 10 days now. He is a big Elmo fan so this one really keeps his attention. He also loves the movie 1,2,3 Count with me. The main character in that one is Ernie. I love the older Sesame Street videos as they seem to focus more on the numbers and letters. The current show seems to have too many mini shows inside the show and doesn't seem to have enough repetition with numbers or letters. I would rather show one of these any day over the show.",1288656000,2,732,4.055172413793104

I think my 8 and 10 yr old watch it more, its funny they say they are putting it on for their little sister but they watch it and my 2 yr old doesn't stay interested in it. I think she will like it one day, she does love seeing the characters at Sesame Place and when we see Sesame Street Live, but she is just really into Barney right now. Everything has to be Barney. I did think it was a cute video and if you are an Elmo fan and Abby Cadabby you'll love it.",1274486400,,518,3.761467889908257

Their music just seemed kind of ""off"".  I enjoyed Alicia Keys performance and the Bert and Ernie skit.  I also wasn't a fan of Kevin James as Santa....more so him singing.
I really liked the story and I liked Stiller the Elf and my son seemed to enjoy it!  That's all that matters!",1260576000,,516,4.181818181818182
3481184,5,B001B3LIME,"This is by far the best Elmo DVD. My two year old daughter wants to see this on a regular basis. It's Christmas on my HDTV all year 'round!
The best part is Kevin James' Santa Claus singing 'We Believe, we believe' at the end of the DVD. We can get that rockin' pretty good at our house. If I only had a 7.1 surround sound system, I'd have the cops visiting due to neighbors complaints, I bet. But they'd probably be wanting me to start the DVD over again.",1244937600,,456,4.0777777777777775

This was the first christmas were I could explain to my 2 year old son that this is a special time of year and he doesn't just look a me blanking while drooling.  I think that Elmo and sesame street are so wonderful.  After watching this movie he kind of got the hang of saying Christmas merry christmas.  I love sesame street.  I also just purchased Elmos potty time to try and get him to warm up to the potty a little more.  These dvds are perfect for introducing something new to your little one.  And there are lots of celebrity singers that make it enjoyable for you to hear as well.,1231718400,,611,4.170940170940171
3481240,5,B001B3LIME,I purchased this DVD for my 20 month old god daughter and she absolutely loves it.  Her mom hates me because she wants to watch it several times a day.

3481243,4,B001B3LIME,"Elmo is the man,and has managed to get some famous faces on his lastest holiday TV movie ""Elmo's Christmas Countdown."" Airing in 2007 on ABC Networks during the Christmas Season Elmo and Co left me wanting an encore, as other holiday specials were receiving.  Alas,no repeats, and not a return come the 2008 season. This made me eager to find this special. A viewing of a daytime talk show mentioned the film's release this year.
I bought  the movie,and watched start to finish. It follows as the TV airing. There seems to be no extras, other than closed caption.
Those with motion disorders may be uncomfortable with the moving motions at the start of the film.",1230681600,3,662,4.698275862068965
3481244,5,B001B3LIME,"We LOVE this DVD.  I bought it for my Elmo loving 20-month-old and honestly, I love it too.  One of the hallmarks of Sesame Street is that they try to engage the parents as well as the children and they succeeded with this one.

Stiller the Elf (played by Ben Stiller) is funny.  Yes, as someone else posted there is one part where he says ""There isn't a snowballs chance in ..."" when another character interrupts before he can say the bad ""H"" word.  But the point is, he DOESN'T say it!  I personally find the snowball that whacks the elf in the head really funny.  I also don't think that the term ""Elfin Menace"" sounds remotely like anything dirty.

There are other little subtleties that adults will get that kids probably won't like when the frustrated Stiller the Elf says, ""Maybe I'll be a dentist"" (tip of the hat to Hermy in Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer).

All in all, it is just good, plain holiday fun, and I highly recommend it, as well as Elmo's Happy Holidays!",1230508800,4,976,4.407821229050279
