8110769,4,B000EJ9VHK,"This film is not as terrible as some of the other reviewers are making it out to be.  It is a young adult, girl-meets-boy film and most of the cast has some sort of strange psychic power.  It is silly, it is gross and shallow and a lot of fun!

The parts that are complained about seem to be people misinterpreting the plot or not paying attention, the boys in the locker room are part of the ""Ultra"" psychic students and are there looking for Moon because they know she has powers and they want her to join them.

The scene where Hyland grabs Moon's chest, at the time she was throwing anything she could get her hands on at him as they were arguing over the ""Push-Over"" contest.  He was trying to get her to stop and grabbed at her hands and missed, completely accidentally.

I recommend this movie if you like lighthearted films that feature super-powered teens falling in love as they battle to shove each other out of a sandbox then go on to save the world from the most ridiculous apocalypse ever.",1322352000,,1003,4.365591397849462
8110770,1,B000EJ9VHK,"A previous reviewer says this movie is appropriate for all ages, but that depends on your personal views.  I'm a children's librarian and purchased this DVD for our collection.  Our cataloger noticed that in tiny letters on the bottom right of the DVD it says, ""Not suitable for children"".  So I watched the movie at home and found out why.  There are several references to the main character's chest size.  Boys peeping in the girls locker room.  (they don't see anything as the girls are just chatting and not undressing).  Several uses of the term, ""pervert"" and toward the end of the movie, Moon gets her chest grabbed by Hyland (when his hands are painted) so she has handprints on her chest, which she is quite proud of.  Besides being very choppy and having no real depth to the characters, this movie has a basically cute idea that isn't done justice.  I moved this film from our children's section to the teen department as I think that's the audience that might be able to get something out of this film.",1198627200,5,1014,4.588888888888889

The film traces a young woman's crush on a neighbor boy and the help she receives from her insect-friends. Along the way, the viewer discovers that she (Moon) is not the only person with ""Ultra Powers"" ... a small dog guides her to Psychic Park where she meets other ""super-talented"" young-people. They plan to demonstrate their acumen in the International Push-Over Contest (where one literally pushes people over). Since the prize is a ""close encounter"" with the ""nymph"" (meaning faerie-like young woman) host, the young women do not participate. (Strrrrike ONE). After the competition, a careless gesture causes the near collapse of the world ... can the cast of misfits make amends and save the world?

Here's the cast of characters:

Hyland: The object of Moon's affection. He is an illiterate bodega employee who is repulsed by human touch. He possesses a ""Matrix-like"" ability to dodge assaults. He appears to have no offensive moves ... until he regains his ability to touch (not a spoiler) and only desires to ""touch"" the front of girl's shirts (with giant yellow hand-prints to mark his conquest ... ahh, but that's offensive in a different way). (Strrrrike TWO).

Moon: A color-blind, reportedly ""unintelligent"" (the film uses a much more crass word) young woman. She can command insects. Her fickle, self-centered tendencies cause the near-destruction of the planet.

Pearl and Jade: Identical twins with the power of ""positive and negative force."" They basically throw garbage at folks they don't like (as in banana peels, discarded bottles etc...)

Baldy: He can jump slightly above-average heights ...  but his face explodes in grotesque blemishes with the least ""magical"" strain.

Smarty: He has the ability to predict the future ... but sometimes only predicts the past.

Eggy: The more thinks about girls, the more his nose-hair grows (no joke). He may or may not possess the ability to see through bathroom doors (no joke ... and not very funny ... just creepy).

Auntie: The only character who nearly redeems this film. A composed adult who appears thirty but is actually seventy years-old. She bears a most ordinary ""magical packet"" which may save all humanity. Her tango with Hyland is the only memorable moment of this film.

Golden Retrievers: They arrive late in the film ... no spoilers here.

This film was painfully empty and vaguely offensive. The crass jokes and bodily references were disappointing, but between the bad musical numbers and the bad acting, it was virtually unbearable. It elicited not a single laugh from me ... STRRRRIKE THREE!

I know that the bad critical reviews of Chi-Leung Law's ""Chung Buk Ji"" did not stop me from buying it, but take this advice ... Netflix it.",1198108800,2,3037,5.59041394335512
8110772,5,B000EJ9VHK,"A cute and innocent film about a group of second string super heros.  They try to fit in and survive in our normal world.  however things are not always what they seam as just about everyone in town has either a zany secret or special power.

This is a fun movie and can be watched by all ages.

Enjoy.",1181001600,2,302,4.067796610169491
