5007336,4,B006NKFAB0,"Great movie, kept me literally on the edge of my seat.  Scary - but I had to watch the whole movie.  Guess what...no nightmares of huge spiders.  You want to be scared, this is a movie for you to view.  The spiders were very realistic looking, not mechanical.  Watch for more from Patty, played by Diana Terranova she is in the Pandora Experiment coming out later this year.",1336521600,,374,4.4411764705882355
5007337,3,B006NKFAB0,"Camel Spiders was produced by Roger Corman and directed by Jim ""Jay Andrews"" Wynorski. Both have clearly forgotten how to make a cheesy exploitation movie. Camel Spiders has the gore, mostly CGI granted, but it is lacking in nudity and laughs. Still, Camel Spiders is pretty fun when the spiders are actually onscreen. They are big CGI creations that kill everyone that they see, and sometimes the CGI blood doesn't look too bad. This movie is fairly fast-paced and doesn't waste much time before the spiders start wreaking havoc. I also liked the retro opening credits, which reminded me of an 80's movie. And there is one character in this movie who is so despicable that I cheered when he bit it! See Camel Spiders if you're a fan of these kinds of movies. We don't get many killer spider movies anymore and that is reason enough to give this one a watch. It's not as good as Kingdom of the Spiders, Eight Legged Freaks, or Aracnophobia, but Camel Spiders isn't bad.",1335571200,2,969,4.6395348837209305
5007338,5,B006NKFAB0,"I live for movies like this, I have quite a collection, I watch them repeatedly, I never tire of their sorry state; make no mistake this is a crappy movie!  But I love it.
Movies like this defy logic, they never make any sense, and that's beauty of them.  They're earnest in their attempt to be accepted as real movies, not just toss-offs that never make it anywhere.  They just want to be liked.  Someone has to, might as well be me.

I am not deluded, I know it's not particularly well written; it has no dialog worth quoting, half of the storyline disappeared without resolution, it's a mess.  It's a notch short of inept.  On the other hand, you've got Brian Krause trying to channel John Wayne and poor C. Thomas Howell as a good old boy, both trying desperately to rise above the debacle, and failing, but in trying they become a marvel to behold.  Not many actors would lower their standards this much (I can't imagine the pay was all that good, the script alone must have cost a buck fifty, the CG a buck more).  It takes a lot of nerve to produce garbage like this, I appreciate that.

However, if you have a certain mindset that enjoys novelties like this, you might just love it too.  Others beware.
As for me, I'm glad I bought it, was ecstatic watching it, and no doubt about it, I'm keeping it.

But just so we're clear...........it's crap.",1335052800,2,1354,4.393574297188755

5007340,1,B006NKFAB0,This what I thought it might be a documentary from the Middle East and about the camel spider. It presents itself as a horror movie which it is far from. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!,1334016000,,181,4.055555555555555
5007341,3,B006NKFAB0,"I thought most of it was ok. But then there was parts that looked really fake. Like scenes of the spiders. And one time when The spiders were attacking one of the men, you could SEE him busting one of his blood packsd, so it looked like the blood was from the spiders. I kinda lose interest for a movie when alot of it looks fake. But if it wasn't for that, it would have been a really good movie. So if you don't pay attention to alot of the details, like I do. Then you will think it's a really good movie.",1333411200,5,508,3.941747572815534
5007342,4,B006NKFAB0,"Roger Corman, master of the cheesy B-movie, is back with the creepy crawly CAMEL SPIDERS.  All the ingredients that have endeared Corman to us b-movie addicts are shamelessly evident:  average CGI effects; cliched characters and pseudo-factual background.
Admittedly, the six-legged scorpio-spiders are quite creepy and they're shown quite a lot.  The two ""name"" stars---Brian Krause and C. Thomas Howell---give as good a performance as the script allows, but let's face it---we're watching for the bugs...everything else is incidental.
CAMEL SPIDERS sets no new standards in horror cinema, but it IS Cormanesque and therefore entertaining.",1333238400,2,640,5.787234042553192
5007343,3,B006NKFAB0,"Sorry, I haven't watched this movie yet, so no review. But I'll bet this was written by an Iraq war vet. I was there in Desert Storm and we stayed at a place that was crawling with camel spiders. They were creepy!! Guys would catch them and have camel spider fights at night. These spiders were Huge, ugly, and aggressive. I saw one eat a bird! I kid you not! We were a tough Aviation unit (oxymoron?), but we were more frightened of those spiders than any enemy forces.",1333065600,2,470,4.292134831460674

It has average acting, great face reactions, laughable CGI, and really funny moments, so yeah give this a watch or maybe not.",1328659200,5,435,4.589743589743589
5007345,2,B006NKFAB0,"I enjoyed the opening credits of bright green coming at you while some action western music is playing. The opening scene has a lot of action. US forces are fighting against...Taliban? In Iraqistan or somewhere? One US soldier is killed. The enemy is carried off by BA spiders. The grasp of the spider causes one to shoot their guns aimlessly into the air instead of at the spider. A spider crawls into the mouth of the dead American soldier and makes it back to the US where through a number of plot continuity issues it is released into the Arizona desert. Do we really transport deceased soldiers in wooden crate boxes?

The spiders are about the size of a cat. No one steps on them or crushes them. They can outrun a human and leap 6 feet into the air. They are very aggressive and always attack people's head...or crotch in one case. There are a number of groups of people trapped by the spiders, who for some reason hunt humans as pack animals. The spiders appear to be CG as are the flames from the guns.

C. Thomas Howell plays the local sheriff and is not the main character. Brian Krause is the main character. The dialouge was unimaginative and boring as were the characters tossed at us.

Little girl: ""Mom, are we going to die?""
Mom: ""No we're not going to die. We are going to be just fine.
Little girl: ""Well, then can you and daddy get back together?""

At one point we hear ""Technically they are not spiders because they have six legs."" If you count the legs: eight.
The film reminded me of that old fashion Roger Corman over the top bad scenes. 2 stars is generous. Might work as a rental for the early tween.

5007348,5,B006NKFAB0,"This movie creeped me out something fierce.  There actually are Camel Spiders, and they may not look like these exactly, but there definately are similarties.  They wouldn't have to have lethal venom, if I got one or two, or, OMG, more on me, I die of a heart attack before they bit me.  Not everybody feels the same about spiders as I do, but watch the movie and see if it doesn't make you squirm just a little bit.",1388534400,3,416,4.2405063291139244
5007349,4,B006NKFAB0,"Camel spiders was a pretty good movie as far as a creature feature is concerned, and I think Brian Kraus did another outstanding job with his role. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the special effects. The spiders was obviously CGI. The movie would have been a lot better if the computer graphics had been a bit more realistic.

5007352,2,B006NKFAB0,"They can run up to thirty miles per hour. They can grow as large as one foot long. And they can jump up to three feet high. If you believe any of these myths, then CAMEL SPIDERS is the film for you! Taken from the rumors of a giant monstrous arachnid that plagues marines in the Middle East, Roger Corman's latest monster mash follows the citizens of a small desert town who come under attack by a species of deadly spiders that have been brought back from Iraq. CAMEL SPIDERS never asks to be taken seriously, and follows Corman's usual formula that spreads out the action and gore in even intervals to maintain just enough interest for people to sit through the rest of the mindless plot. The acting is better than usual, with enjoyable leads played by THE HITCHER's C. Thomas Howell and Brian Krause of Charmed and SLEEPWALKERS. On the other hand, the computerization used to bring the spiders to life is entirely unconvincing, as the creatures hardly interact with the actors or environments. There is plenty of bloodshed to go around, however, ranking CAMEL SPIDERS just above DINOSHARK and SUPERGATOR.

The spiders look ridiculous, they change sizes right before your eyes (one would be the size of a boot and suddenly its big enough to crush a car), the whole time you are basically bored. Not worth it for me. And sadly this movie doesn't even have any comedy to keep it afloat. Stick with Arachniphobia or even Big Ass Spider.",1457568000,,425,4.605263157894737
8501396,1,B006NKFAB0,"Boy I really love Roger Cormans films.  Never did a Director do so much with so little.  But Camel Spiders is bad even for a Corman film, even though he serves only as the Producer.  Camel Spiders have become the stuff of urban legend over the past 20 years of wars in the Middle East.  In truth they are not technically spiders despite the name but their large size have given them a near mythical reputation for terrifying the bejeezus out of people.  But here the plot becomes so incredibly silly from the beginning and turns these hand-size bugs into the size of medium dogs.

The film begins in an unspecified desert in the Middle East (think Afghanistan) as American soldiers are in a firefight with enemy forces who again are unspecified but think Taliban. As the bullets fly the giant spiders crawl out of the ground to see what the commotion is and proceed to kill the enemy soldiers, dragging the bodies away leaving the Americans, and we the viewer, completely puzzled.  The commanding officer Captain Sturges is wounded and earns a trip home, along with the body of a fellow soldier killed in action.  But a handful of spiders hitch a ride home in the soldiers coffin, ala Arachnophobia.

As the Captain and Sgt Shelly Underwood are transporting the body through the Arizona desert (which looks suspiciously like the Middle Eastern desert but ones just like the other, right?) their truck crashes, spilling the coffin and its stowaways which have grown much larger.  The soldiers are lead into town by Sheriff Beaumont (C. Thomas Howell).  While having lunch at the local diner, the restaurant comes under attack by the spiders which have hulked up to the size of an average terrier. Whats more these things have a bite which instantly kills their prey.  Now, these spiders are not said to be the result of radiation or a military experiment gone awry.  No, were supposed to believe they have always been there and been this large.  And you thought Afghanistan was a crappy place to live before!  The survivors flee to an abandoned industrial plant to make a final stand against the horde of Solifugae (thats the technical name for the speciesnever let it be said I don't do my homework).

Camel Spiders is about as dumb a film as you could ever be unfortunate enough to encounter.  Bad dialog delivered by bad actors with CGI that makes most SyFy channel films look they were produced by George Lucas.  This is videogame quality CGI circa the mid 1990s as the spiders dons so much walk along the desert floor as they do glide.  Conveniently the soldiers had a crate full of assault rifles so they could arm all the civilians.  Yet as they are fleeing in a pickup truck have of them are aiming up in the air.  I double-checkednone of the spiders were flying.  There are times when you see a character totally surround by the spiders and in the next scene the spiders are gone.  Even worse, the fate of two college students who were fleeing the spiders is never resolved.  Its like they ran out of film so said ah screw it!
This is pure, disposable entertainment.  40  50 years ago this is the kind of film that was shown as part of a double feature in less prominent theaters or drive-ins.  Today they go direct-to-video.",1438387200,2,3233,4.626315789473685
