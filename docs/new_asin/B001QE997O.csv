8335466,5,B001QE997O,"Darrin and Jaime have alot of fun in this video showing you all the different techniques that they use to achieve their unique harmony style. This video gives you everything but the kitchen sink when it comes to duo harmony singing. Somehow they are able to fit in all of their backgrounds and influences as well. I saw these guys play live here in my hometown at DELFEST and immediately went out and got this. Vocally this is one of the best acts ever and they give it all away in this video, I promise.",1281571200,7,504,4.315789473684211
