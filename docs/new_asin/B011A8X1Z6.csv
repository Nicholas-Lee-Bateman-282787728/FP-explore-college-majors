7331761,3,B011A8X1Z6,"If you blend The Omen, Carrie and a little childhood angst you'll get June--an indie pic that follows a young girl, who as a baby was saved during a weird cultish ritual only to grow up moving from one foster home to the next. Apparently young June has an ancient spirit inside of her thanks to the ritual and with that comes some gnarly powers, but unfortunately she has trouble controlling them. After causing a little mishap at her last family outing (an explosion at a trailer park during a public BBQ) she has now moved in with a seemingly nice middle-class family.

For the most part everything's coming up Milhouse (June!--sorry, Simpsons reference), though she'll get the occasional random outburst that causes stuff to break or fly around, but hey other than that things are peachy. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the family, the remaining cult members have been waiting in secret to retrieve June at the right age to finish the ritual, which just happens to be very soon.

June is an okay(ish) film that tends to be a little heavy-handed in the drama department at times, which is one of the issues I had with the flick. I personally felt that it tried a little too hard to convey some sort of deep meaning about acceptance and self identification that seemed unnecessary and out of place. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to just do a coming-of-age drama, but were pressured to do a horror flick by the studio, so they compromised. Either way, it wasn't scary at all and next to the movie's own identity crises, it's a pretty average effort that doesn't deliver anything new to the genre.

Overall, June is a mediocre film that tries to be something it's not, while at the same time offering nothing we haven't already seen. It's not a bad movie, but there's nothing about it that's really good either. It's simply an average, unoriginal, indie pic.",1442448000,8,1855,4.684049079754601
7331762,3,B011A8X1Z6,"The movie wasn't too bad, but the logic was convoluted. A very important child, for the cult of nutcases, is placed with people who live in what appears to be a trailer park, with a crazy couple being as low as it goes, by one of the cult members? Hint, put child in nutcase compound with a make believe family, since the ""social worker"" is the one in charge of placements.",1533600000,,373,4.267605633802817

7331765,3,B011A8X1Z6,It was okay.  I mean a bit predictable and not scary.  It held very much to the possessed but innocent child kind of genre.  Acting was adequate but all but one cast member (the guy who played the social worker).  It was as good as I think I could have hoped for and not worse than I expected by any means.,1531872000,,306,3.9672131147540983
7331766,2,B011A8X1Z6,"June could've been a good idea, but it just plain wasn't made well. It seems like lazy work or rushed work, like they wanted so badly to make it into a movie that they didn't take the time to do it well. It's the quality I'd expect from a made-for-YouTube movie, not even good enough to be a made-for-TV movie. The story is like one of those Creepypasta salads (sometimes called Crappypastas), you know, toss in a bit of demon-possession, some mind-control, some new-dad-hating, open with witches in a forest circle and close with the kid and mom driving away in the car, drop in a predictable reveal that the social worker is in on it and the mom was the blonde who rescued the baby years earlier -- all the standards. And of course the main kid has to be a lonely, abused orphan who wears the same white dress and Mary Janes every day and starts her period at age 9 and no one mentions how unusually early that is.
As for the actors, they aren't terrible, just mediocre. The movie could've been saved by having a good actor play June. The little girl who plays her is pretty and I think she'd be a good actor in other kinds of movies, but this just doesn't seem to be her role. She's not strong enough to have the primary role in a movie, certainly not a horror movie. She's not the worst, of course, but it's distracting that for the entire movie she seems to be just a little girl playing, reminding me of backyard movies we made with our mom's camcorder as a kid. It's weird, but I feel like I'm watching a kid I know so well in real life that I can't manage to see her as a character (to be clear, I don't know her; I mean she just has that little-girl-playing-pretend thing about her). Some scenes, like when she picks up the butterfly, are so cheesy they look like they belong in a parody of this movie rather than the real thing. It could be a problem with the director, but if they'd cast the little girl better, the right child actor could've saved the movie even with a bad director. The little girl who plays June doesn't pull you into the story like child actors of similar movies. She'd probably be cute playing the little sister or the daughter in a movie that doesn't focus on her character, a more real-life type of story, or maybe a sitcom where being fake and cheesy is typical. For horror to work you have to be able to pull in the audience, and although she's a cute kid, she just can't do that. Horror is definitely not her thing.",1531267200,,2453,4.288793103448276

That was really the only huge downside.  There also didn't seem to be a lot of dialogue with the little girl. Understandably she was traumatized yet it was frustrating rarely seeing her speak.  The ending also seemed rushed and nothing was really explained in any detail at the end.  I would have liked to have known more about the cult and what they were into.  The pace of the movie was very good but in the end I felt like things were missing.  There needs to be a little bit of blood and death and darkness for it to be considered scary in my opinion.  The Demon said cool things but nothing seriously intense really happened to scare me.,1462579200,2,781,4.337931034482758

June obviously had supernatural powers. Why was she continuously placed in new homes and not an institution? I mean she yells and people fall out around her or she's stops rainstorms. By the time she is nine, you'd think she would have been institutionalized. Also how could her adoptive mom who looked to be well into her 30s have been a child just nine years before when June was an infant? That messed up the ending of the movie for me. Despite the plot holes, I found the movie entertaining and it kept my interest. I love the 99 cent price but would not have minded paying five bucks to see it.",1457049600,3,839,5.2611940298507465

For one thing, tell me: What brain dead idiot moron came up with Victoria Pratt's character?
She's either missing the entire right side of her brain or she's the most insane, self-deluded, psychotic twit this side of Forest Gump.
You Know a movie is failing if the only way you can make the story work is to make one or more of your characters THAT dumb.
Perhaps Pratt was somehow bewitched by June? Well SHOW US! Her voice-over makes it sound as if she has half a brain, yet her actions defy logic. Poor Pratt. She's better than this.

On more technical issues: Someone completely messed up the edit. Scenes that logically follow one another are separated by what felt like a span of days in the narrative frame. EG the campaing sciene is entirely centered around the events at the school; yet the scenes are separated by 10 minutes of completely unrelated material.

7331846,2,B011A8X1Z6,"June is an indie-style horror film that was recently released on DVD and VOD. Indie Festival films are quickly becoming all the rage these days as many up-and-coming filmmakers are being noticed more and more through these events. June is about a 9 year old girl, of the same name, who is possessed by an entity named Aer, a deity who aims to restore the balance of nature on Earth... by eradicating all mankind.

June's story begins nine years ago as an infant when her parents give her to a cult priestess who makes June part of a dark ritual that bonds Aer to the little girl's soul. Flash forward to the present, the basic setup is that June has been bounced around from foster home to foster home with family members either returning her or suffering injury due to mysterious circumstances. June's latest foster family is the Andersons (David and Lily) who accept June from social worker, Victor Emmanuel, with a warm and welcoming heart. As June settles in, Emmanuel informs the family that Aer is June's ""imaginary friend"" whom June chooses to blame for aggressive behavior on her part.

As the plot progresses, June's condition doesn't immediately manifest itself as one might expect in a horror movie, rather much of the first half of the movie is about the family trying to establish a relationship with June. The second half of the movie is dedicated to the family trying to deal with and understand all the crazy happenings that is going on. It is at this point that it's clear that the cult responsible for enslaving June to Aer is still alive and active and trying to get June back.

The plot isn't particularly new, especially not to people who might have seen Carrie or Rosemary's Baby, but it's sometimes nice to see old ideas still persist into modern times rather than be left forgotten. The story is rather simple with very few plot twists of any sort, one aspect of the plot worth mentioning however is that the movie's narrator has a hidden identity. Outside of this though, there isn't much to add suspense or surprise to a somewhat cliched plot.

Though the first half of the movie is devoted to building human relationships between the characters, the movie fails to actually get the audience to care about June or her foster parents. There are plenty of moments where the family tries to engross June in various activities, however these scenes seem designed more to further the plot rather than build up any of the characters in a meaningful way. Later when the fit starts to hit the shan, it is increasingly difficult for audience members to care about any of these people outside of the simple movie roles that they occupy.

As a result, much of the central conflict in the story fails to build to a satisfying climax. When the foster parents, David and Lily, get into arguments over what to do with June, these scenes are often inadequately fleshed out and possess a rather hollow quality. Secret motives are later revealed among various characters but at this point, the various agendas present in the story are rather typical of stereotypes fitting this genre.

In conclusion, June is your typical child possession/occult film where a nine year old girl is hunted by a cult whom seeks to utilize the malevolent spirit harboring inside her body to destroy the world. There isn't much to differentiate this film from earlier classics, but if you're new to this type of genre then it's still worth giving it a one shot.",1444348800,2,3448,4.719269102990033
