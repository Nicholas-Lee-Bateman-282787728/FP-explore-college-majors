3476162,5,B001AZIS12,"Another one of Mr Black's ""side splitting"" productions.
We're big fans and Mr Black didn't disappoint.",1225324800,7,102,5.4375
3476163,2,B001AZIS12,"If you think your are buying this to continue your Back in Black collection, then forget it.  This is merely a copy of his recent tv show.  If you like the show, you will like this.  If you desire to see Black at his best then.......not fun at all.",1223942400,3,248,4.020408163265306
3476164,1,B001AZIS12,"Being a huge Lewis Black fan, I pre-ordered this DVD with great anticipation.  I was so disappointed when I watched and saw that it was not his stand-up act but a horribly unfunny, scripted attempt to be who?  This certainly is NOT his arena for what he does best and that is... be Lewis!
Stick to your stand-up act or take a final bow.",1223251200,4,336,4.234375
3476165,1,B001AZIS12,"I was excited when I found out that a new Lewis Black DVD with 'all new' material was coming out -- I'm a great fan, and have all his previous work.  I preordered, and have been watching my mail box for a week.  When I received it, I dropped everything so I could watch it.  THIS DVD SUCKS!  Less than a quarter of the DVD was even Lewis Black, and if I want to watch Judge Judy, I'll turn on the TV.  Give me Lewis Black as a standup comic, that's what's he's best at -- but leave the stupid game show adolescence out of it.  If this was my first experience with Lewis Black, I wouldn't even be a fan of his, that's how bad it is!  If you want great Lewis Black, buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Black-Red-White-Screwed/dp/B000GTLQW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis Black: Red, White & Screwed</a>. Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1222905600,4,888,4.88
3476166,4,B001AZIS12,"Lewis Black is undoubtedly one of, if not the, funniest comedians in the business today, which is the one reason that Root of All Evil works as well as it does.  Black presides over some humerous debates between pairs of other comics (including Patton Oswalt, Greg Giraldo, and Mad TV vet Andrew Daly among others), who debate the evils of such things ranging from Oprah, Donald Trump, YouTube, marijuana, and more.  Frequently funny and even containing a good point here and there, Root of All Evil will keep you entertained, and will keep you laughing.  Sadly though, not as many laughs come from Black as one may like, and more often than not the debating comics become the centerpiece.  All in all, Root of All Evil is worth your time, but for big fans of Lewis Black, you may be a bit disappointed that he isn't constantly at the forefront.",1220918400,15,845,4.613333333333333

3476194,3,B001AZIS12,"Not enough of Lewis Black to satisfy me...though the material is funny and well presented. Since I am new to his comedy, this format appears to have been on TV and part of an on-going comedy show. Still, I think it is good but, if you are looking for Lewis Black in a stand-up routine, look elsewhere.",1436400000,,301,4.298245614035087
3476195,5,B001AZIS12,He just cracks me up,1430697600,,20,3.2
3476206,5,B001AZIS12,A good rant as always. This guy freaks out over politics and religion so we don't have to.,1430006400,,90,4.055555555555555
3476207,4,B001AZIS12,Lewis Black is my husband and I's favorite comedian.  He definitely makes sense out of the nonsense that passes as government today.,1429574400,,132,5.0
3476208,4,B001AZIS12,Funny,1425081600,,5,5.0
3476209,1,B001AZIS12,Lewis Black does not have the lead. He acts as a judge hearing the deliberations of 2 comedians defending their point of view about 2 characters. ie: Paris Hilton vs Donald Trump. Any many more. Very boring and definitely Lewis at his worst.,1423785600,,241,4.627906976744186
3476210,2,B001AZIS12,His only bomb that i know.. But it isn't very good. Probably because he included other comics.,1422230400,,94,4.588235294117647
3476211,5,B001AZIS12,my grandson was so happy when he got  4 of his dvd thank you,1419379200,,60,3.2857142857142856
3476212,1,B001AZIS12,This was without a doubt the worst money I ever spent.  Nothing at all like the Lewis Black entertainment we have seen and like.  If there was any way to get my money back for purchasing this I would.  If you are looking for classic Lewis Black DON'T BUY THIS!!!,1411084800,,262,4.2
3476213,5,B001AZIS12,"great presence here. meant as comedic, it succeeds on all fronts, and affronts. whether ad libed or scripted, it makes the point. thank you mr. black",1410998400,,149,4.769230769230769
3476214,4,B001AZIS12,Funny funny Lewis. I am a fan. So everything he does is wonderful.,1406937600,,66,4.153846153846154
3476215,1,B001AZIS12,I am a fan. But I couldn't get past the excessive vulgarity on this one. Turned it off after a couple of minutes.,1406764800,,113,3.9565217391304346
3476236,5,B001AZIS12,one of the best comedians I have ever seen if you get a chance to see Lewis Black do it,1403136000,,87,3.4
3476237,5,B001AZIS12,Some reviewers have complained that other comedians are featured in this as much as Lewis Black. Anyone who has ever listened to Black's comedy recognizes that these are his words coming out of their mouths. It had me in the first five minutes!,1399852800,,244,4.6976744186046515
3476238,5,B001AZIS12,watched these on comedy central and loved it then. now that we own it we love it when we need a good laugh.,1383696000,2,107,3.6956521739130435
3476239,5,B001AZIS12,"I don't know what it is about Lewis Black, if it's his angry, shouting, peed off routine, or what, but I find him entertaining. I am not much for the hardcore comedian's like Andrew Dice Clay, nor am I for silly comedic. Black sort of fits in between somewhere. In this DVD, Black is the host of two comedians that debate some silly stuff; Two comedians take sides in debating which is worse: Oprah vs. the Catholic Church; Paris Hilton vs. Dick Cheney, and more. It's will give you a few good laughs.",1381190400,2,501,4.397849462365591
3476240,5,B001AZIS12,"I've been a fan of Black for years. I missed this season when it aired on Comedy Central. I did see a few shows from season two. It's much more enjoyable uncensored. I'm now looking for season two ""uncensored"". If you like Black, You will like this.",1369958400,,249,4.319148936170213
3476241,5,B001AZIS12,"So funny and so true. Arrived on time, well packed, and as described.
Lewis Black is fantastic. I bought all of the tapes.",1360713600,2,122,4.3478260869565215
3476242,5,B001AZIS12,I thought this was a great concept. I always enjoy watching Lewis perform. He never diasappoints when it comes to a live show!,1360281600,3,126,4.521739130434782
3476243,4,B001AZIS12,"I bought this DVD hoping to see Lewis Black skewering pop culture/politics/society in general, as he usually does. Unfortunately (my fault, didn't read the item description well enough) this is other comedians in the ""courtroom of public opinion"" with Black as judge. He only offers a few good lines per episode, although, to be fair, the other comedians often have some good one-liners. If you want Back-in-Black-esqe material, look elsewhere.",1262995200,4,444,5.357142857142857
3476244,5,B001AZIS12,"Ok, so Lewis Black has had some great DVD's come out. They are all hilarious, but i have to say the new film trailer on  [...] looks like this one is really going to top them all! Check it out and keep laughing everyone!",1253836800,,220,4.0
3476245,5,B001AZIS12,"IT is a series of skits, with many great gems. There are moments where it can fail, but think of it like a courtroom Dailyshow...kind of but not really. It is a made up vs debate where two comedians go head to head on why one thing is worse than another. Lewis judges, and jumps in from time to time, but the others (who have been on the Dailyshow and such) do the presentin of both sides. This is not 100% Black, it is more like 20% his work and the rest of the talk time is the presenters. I loved this show, downloaded every episode I could, now it is out on dvd...and it is mine!

Some people may not feel 5 stars is correct, but I felt this show was so great at times I could not fault it. But if you are a Lewis Black fan...well you should like it too, but it seems from the other reviews they have issues with other people presenting. Hey it is both seasons!",1239062400,10,865,4.0

8280575,1,B001AZIS12,Not what I expected.,1490140800,,20,4.25
8280576,4,B001AZIS12,"Fun concept of a court room set up with Lewis Black preciding over his team of court jesters. Comedians battle each other in a game of wits trying to convince Judge Black that their concept, ranging from Donald Trump to the Catholic church and PETA, is the Root of All Evil, resulting in some hilarious leaps of logic. This is especially true for the Ripple of Evil section of each episode.
A great show with some fantastic comedic talent involved.",1488672000,,448,4.6125
8280577,1,B001AZIS12,this is a waste of money,1476230400,,24,3.1666666666666665

8280579,2,B001AZIS12,not like the format... thought it was LB stand up... disappointed,1466467200,,65,5.0
8280580,2,B001AZIS12,"I am a real lover of most things Lewis Black.  This short-lived series was just not my cup of tea.  I suppose for the slap-stick type of humor, it serves it's purpose.  But it is far-less content and current-event rich as his stand-up routines and commentary.  The bulk of the show isn't really Mr. Black delivering humorous input, but rather two co-stars/other comedians.  Just lacks the brilliance, for me, of his other body of work.  I suppose for the format of the show, it is what it is supposed to be.  Frankly, I couldn't even finish watching it.  I will be attempting to sell it, or give it away to someone with a different sense of humor than myself.",1465171200,,659,4.4789915966386555
