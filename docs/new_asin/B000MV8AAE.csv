2749782,4,B000MV8AAE,"I bought this DVD set a few days ago, and I was really surprised at how great this documentary was. The documentary is in 4 parts, each part is around 50 minutes long. The list of case covered in the documentary is really impressing: JFK, The Black Dahlia, Ted Bundy, OJ Simpson, Son of Sam, The Butcher of Kingsbury Run (a.k.a. The Torso Killer), The Lindbergh Kidnapping, The Hillside Strangler, The murder of John Lennon, The Assassination of Rasputin, The Oklahoma City Bombing, The Assassination of Martin Luther King, The case of Sam Sheppard, The Assassination of Robert Kennedy, The Boston Strangler, Charles Manson and many more.

The narrator is very good, he have a great voice, and the background music is very chilling and add a lot to the documentary. The documentary features a lot of the actual Crime Scenes photos and a lot of great archival footage ( a lot of time in black and White ), the people who have produced this documentary did a very good job of locating all the pictures/footages of all these very important criminal cases.

Plus the Two DVDs comes in a very beautiful, big Metal Box, with the inscriptions in 3D, just to add to the quality of the set.

The only thing missing: There's nothing about The Zodiac Killer or the murder of JonBenet Ramsey. If both these cases were featured on the set then I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4. But like I said earlier the list of case featured in this documentary is very impressing ( Happy to see a chapter about Cleveland's Torso Killer ).

If you are a fan of True Crimes, real life murder mysteries and Serial Killers then please buy this awesome DVD set. It's not perfect, but you won't be disappointed. And for less than 15$ you can't go wrong.",1307923200,8,1731,4.556270096463023
2749783,4,B000MV8AAE,"If there is anything I learned in my high school US History class is that the 1900s was the bloodiest century of all time with all of the wars, genocide and the overall atrocities that took place around the world. After watching this 2-Disc DVD Collection, I realized that this is an awesome DVD Collection to own that shows gruesome and often times shocking images of crime scene photos with a lot of blood and gore in addition to actual footage and in some cases re-enactments in some of the stories.

There are 4 parts that are depicted in this collection that include: Assassinations, Unsolved, By Reason of Insanity AND Cold-Blooded Murder. Even though I was in grade school at the time of the OJ Simpson trial, I followed the trial closely and in spite of my best efforts to see any crime scene photos, I was unsuccessful. This documentary-style DVD Collection was the first outlet for me to see the bloody crime scene where they actually show photos (or stills) of the trails of blood and the bodies of the victims, which both shocked and surprised me that they'd actually show the footage. Additionally, The Black Dahlia is also depicted in this collection and also shows the mutilated corpse of the Hollywood-hopeful. Needless to say, this has some very shocking and otherwise vivid images that I have never seen prior to owning this collection.

OJ Simpson and The Black Dahlia are only two of many stories being portrayed in this collection, but I have to give credit where credit is due and say that this is a great piece of work that depicts some of the terrible Crimes of the Century. Very straight-to-the-point and easy to follow along and highly recommended from a realist person who is all about facts over glamor.",1285718400,15,1731,4.70957095709571
2749784,1,B000MV8AAE,"Don't waste your time on this so called ""fact"" based video.  This video is nothing but a bunch of pictures while you get to listen to a whole lot of off the wall opinions.  After watching this you would have too believe that the government is responsible for every major crime to happen in this country this century.",1242172800,4,316,4.431034482758621

It's really well done and the narration and presentation are interesting and informative. The stories move along quickly and cover a wide range. If crime drama interests you, this one is highly recommended.",1522022400,,297,5.208333333333333

8172509,1,B000MV8AAE,Very disappointing & not what I thought it was going to be. This seems to be very low budget. I mainly bought this for the Manson murders. Pretty awful & I didn't learn anything new. They didn't even get the facts right. Rosemary LaBianca ( on the 2nd night of murder) was NOT strangled the only positive thing I can say is there were a couple of clips of Charlie and of Bugliosi I hadn't see before. The Ted Bundy episode was very sloppily put together. Luckily I paid next to nothing for this.,1454803200,2,495,4.276595744680851
8172510,3,B000MV8AAE,"Eh... unimpressed with the quality of the footage. I have seen it all before. And there is not equal footage for every incident they talk about, which bothers me.",1452470400,,162,4.620689655172414

8172514,4,B000MV8AAE,"I read and watch a lot of true crime. I would call this a collection more for the casual or new comer to the genre. Still very enjoyable for those well versed and read in true crime as a light viewing and refresher of cases. The price is reasonable and it's an enjoyable collection. If you're looking for really deep and expansive material this probably won't please you. If you're just looking for a set to add to your collection or just learn and absorb something new, then you'll be satisfied.",1358985600,5,496,4.461538461538462
8172515,3,B000MV8AAE,"Expecting a bit more body, somewhat disappointed at the lack of creativity. Parhaps, it is the Internet, where I could have probably hacked (pun) together what is already available. In truth, as a dedicated documentarian, I do not remember how much innovative meat was in the well- packaged DVD.",1326758400,,295,5.040816326530612
