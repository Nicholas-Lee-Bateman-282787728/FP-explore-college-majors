8560376,5,B00B0OJXW6,"This documentary had a screening at the local college last week.  It was an excellent documentary showing the viewers what it is like for our soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.  The Marine unit was trying to clean terrorists out of several small villages.  They started out with about 50 armored personnel carriers and after seven months about 30 had been damaged by IEDs which left the unit to do much of their work on foot. There was also much fraud by village officials.  The Marines would set up health clinics for the local citizens and the supplies would disappear into the black market.  A surprise at the end of the screening was that the producer of the film and one of the Marine corpsman, Chief Petty Officer Motz who had much presence in the film, were in the audience and answered questions for about an hour.  One was left with the feeling that when the unit left the area, the villages would revert to their state before the arrival of the unit.  I saw American Sniper this weekend and I had the same feeling after that movie - that after the Marines left the area in Irag, it would revert to what it had been before hand. I am a veteran and I cannot imagine fighting under the conditions that our soldiers fight under today - an enemy hiding and operating from among the citizens of the country.",1423958400,,1310,4.5021097046413505
8560377,5,B00B0OJXW6,"This video conveys a great deal of what it must have been like for so many of our American soldiers coping with sudden death, brain concussions from improvised explosive devices, traveling in million-dollar IED ""proof"" vehicles (and ruining most of them), boredom, not being understood by the native Afghans, not understanding the native Afghans, and in general existing like they had been beamed down from some mother ship onto a barren land for a poorly understood purpose, like something out of Star Trek or Star Wars.  Yet the soldiers don't lose their compassion or humanity.  They just go on doing their job.  At times, the video might seem a little boring, but it seems to honestly display the boredom and emptiness of their environment, and their sadness and frustration about bringing so little help to the natives.

The camera work and production are by Robert Hodierne, in 1966 the first American civilian photographer in Vietnam, now with half a century of experience photographing American soldiers at war from close up, living with them, writing about them, interviewing them, editing military news material about them, and caring deeply for them.",1410652800,,1161,5.126984126984127
8560378,1,B00B0OJXW6,"I personally was a corpsman with the company in this documentary and it showed very little besides what our chief did. Many corpsman suffered through that deployment and the sites they had to see still haunt us. This documentary should be retitled to the Kresterson, Grover and fake portrail of the chief. I bought this documentary expecting to see what really went on to give people the idea of what we go through. Maybe I am a disgruntled corpsman but we are few and had to see things from body parts of small children, watch innocent people die and get NO recongnition for the things we do.",1392249600,3,593,4.5514018691588785
8560379,5,B00B0OJXW6,"I appreciated ""The Surge"" greatly for the thoughtful comments of the troops and the steady camera work. I think the steady camera really enhanced the experience. We are often subjected to shakeycam in combat videos and, of course, tripod and dolly shots with high key lighting on television.

This combination worked for ""The Surge"" because the documentary is professional but the emotions and reactions on camera are real and unscripted. Everything was real, not a Hollywood set.

Some of the reactions of the U.S. Marines when faced with civilian casualties reminded me of the ambush scene in ""The Anderson Platoon"" by Pierre Schoendoerffer. That 1967 documentary was one of the first Vietnam films I viewed after returning home from nearly two and a half years in Vietnam. I was surprised how Schoendoerffer was able to really tell the daily saga of a U.S. infantry unit.

Robert Hodierne and Rob Curtis were able to accomplish the same with the Marines of A-1-1 because of their professionalism. Hodierne had years of combat experience in Vietnam and Curtis had the steady cinematography down pat.

Like the ""observational"" films of Frederick Wiseman, ""The Surge"" represents a long-term committment by Hodierne and Curtis to capture unscripted and unmanipulated moments of highly credible characters who are given more depth as the documentary unfolds.

There is also a ""Band of Brothers"" theme developed as the Marines interact over the months and feel frustration in their roles in Afghanistan.

Officers, including one wearing silver insignia, try to put a smiley face on their role during the surge but this does not match the concerns of the sergeants and privates.

Hodierne has produced and directed an important historical benchmark during the long-running war which has developed many twists and turns. The overall strategy might be flawed, but to be an observer of the young men of one combat unit has great value in attempting to understand the war.

I have recommended ""The Surge"" to my current and past journalism students so they might get a sense of the experience of being embedded as a journalist with a combat unit",1360022400,4,2136,5.082857142857143
