5053144,5,B0072X9QVM,"This is one of the best family comedies I've ever seen. Hilarious. The writing is incredibly witty, the adult and child actors are superb, and it captures the frustrations and joys of parenting like few if any shows before it. hope it gets out on u.s. dvd format soon! meanwhile watch for it on pbs.",1314403200,8,299,4.454545454545454
5053145,5,B0072X9QVM,"Just by chance, I saw an episode on TV for the first time this week and laughed through the entire episode.  Can't believe its not available for US viewers!  Anyone know if this will be available anytime soon?",1309824000,10,209,4.473684210526316
5053146,5,B0072X9QVM,"Outnumbered is an amazingly intertaining video.  Each of the actors, adult and children, is an actor/actress of exceptional ability.  The shame of it all is that the video, so far, is offered in a non-USA format.  If you can catch it on TV, do you.  After one installment, you will spend your week waiting to see the next installment.",1306627200,12,334,4.610169491525424

5053148,2,B0072X9QVM,"I made an attempt to watch the first show on A corn streaming, but could not handle the swaying of the filming, back and forth, as if an amateur was running the camera.  I quit watching when I became dizzy viewing it.  Heads up for those who can't handle that type of filming.",1417478400,,276,4.188679245283019

5053151,5,B0072X9QVM,"Very funny, touching show about family chaos. The Karen character (the youngest child) is particularly wonderful - she's smart, funny, and provides some brilliant ad libs - a budding barrister (as they note in the series). Interesting extras, too.",1398643200,,247,5.358974358974359
5053152,5,B0072X9QVM,"I love this show! I watched it for the first time last night and I really enjoyed it. The children are simply amazing actors and are so cute and funny! Why isn't it available in the U.S.? We need ""Outnumbered"" here in the U.S!  Loved it!!!!!",1383955200,,241,4.239130434782608
5053153,5,B0072X9QVM,All I have to do now is to order a DVD player for region two. Outnumber does not come in my region like the other British sitcoms. This is what you have to do to enjoy this series.,1373673600,3,180,3.763157894736842
5053154,5,B0072X9QVM,"As an ex-pat Brit, my parents told me about this show. The reason that it looks improvised is because all of the kids lines are just that - 100% improvisation. The parents have a loose script to work from - and there is a general scenario for the episode - but all of the kids dialog is improvised. Hence the occasional feeling of anarchy - - brilliant concept and great fun to watch.",1373414400,2,384,4.273972602739726
5053155,4,B0072X9QVM,"I have really enjoyed the humour of this programme, and find the situations very believable. A very few episodes didn't quite reach the quality of the rest. Great acting.",1373241600,2,170,4.896551724137931
5053156,5,B0072X9QVM,"I love 'Outnumbered""!  The series has you laughing out lour for half an hour, and the children are so real.  You can just imagine the parents' frustration in dealing with them.  Mom and Dad are also real - not perfect, not happy all of the time, but dealing with life as best they can.",1372204800,4,285,4.2407407407407405
5053157,5,B0072X9QVM,Fell in love with this when it was broadcast on public television.  Had to buy the DVDs when they stopped showing it.  Highly addictive watching.  I can sit down in the evening to watch an episode and find I've watched 3.,1371772800,4,221,4.341463414634147
5053158,5,B0072X9QVM,"Typical British humor, delivered by a score of excellent actors.  From the youngest to the oldest.  Another BBC winner to cherish..",1367539200,3,131,5.190476190476191
5053159,5,B0072X9QVM,Such a wonderful series.  Every episode is a gem.  The children are so adorable and the parents so easy ro identify with.  And who doesn't have a relative like Angela?,1365811200,4,167,4.5

My husband laughed until he nearly choked at some scenes, absolutely priceless.",1355788800,3,127,5.095238095238095
5053161,3,B0072X9QVM,not all the dvds are from the same region code! thank goodness we have an older player that plays all region codes as half do not play on our newer machine. frustrating to say the least,1355529600,,185,4.166666666666667
5053162,5,B0072X9QVM,"First off, ignore the low ratings based on the vendor and the PAL format. It's utterly ridiculous to give a low rating to a product based on a seller (duh, that's why Amazon has a separate place for its customers to vendor feedback on third party sellers). It's also ridiculous to give a low rating because you don't have a clue about video formats.

This UK series featuring a family of five slightly reminds me of U.S. shows such as Malcolm in the Middle, The Middle, and Modern Family -- with the exception that it has a very British tone and it is much cleverer, relying less on extreme situations and more on the brilliant dialog and great acting. The dialog is so natural, that at times it seems like it was stream of thought ad-libbing by the actors. Every character reminds me of somebody that I know, every situation is familiar. The two youngest children don't even appear to be acting at all, and certainly have more talent than so many sitcoms with kids who simply parrot lines.

They're all fascinating characters, and the writers know how to find the hilarity and absurdity in mundane day to day life. You won't be able to watch just one episode at a time, and may find yourself binging on the whole set over a weekend.",1348358400,14,1233,4.5
5053163,5,B0072X9QVM,"My husband and I are head over heels for this show.  Funny, intelligent, thoroughly entertaining.  You can watch them many times over and catch new things each time.  I guess it's not for everyone as we don't know anyone else who likes it as much as we do.  It's a rare jewel.",1340928000,3,276,4.25
5053164,1,B0072X9QVM,"i didn't know that Region 2 meant I couln't watch this in the US.  You shouldn't assume people know this.  I wanted to share these with my family and no one is interested in watching them on a laptop.  I really didn't appreciate the company's response to my question either.  They just said it was clearly stated ""region 2"" and that a return would only give me 50% of my money back.",1337126400,10,382,4.263888888888889
5053165,2,B0072X9QVM,"I ordered this item from fantastic-stuff, an Amazon Market vendor, on March 30. I received word that it had been sent out on April 4 and would arrive between April 6 and April 23.  Since the item was to be sent from New York to the Washington DC area, I was amazed by the April 23 date, but waited patiently.  When April 23 had arrived without arrival of the package, I contacted the vendor. On Tuesday, April 24, the vendor sent me an email in which he said that he was sorry, the package probably had gotten lost, and that he would refund my shipping cost and send the package to me with 2-day shipping at his expense.  I agreed, and expected the package to arrive by Friday, April 27. It didn't arrive then either.  When I got it on April 28, I noticed that the package had not been sent with 2-day shipping but with Priority Mail.  Priority Mail can arrive in two days, but it can also arrive within three or four.  I finally got my package on April 28, almost a month after placing my order.
On the bright side, this series is delightful and I cannot understand why it is not yet out in Region 1 format.  I can play these disks on my region-free blu-ray and dvd player, but most people in this country cannot.",1336089600,4,1214,4.252173913043478
5053166,5,B0072X9QVM,"Husband and I love this show.  We were going to have to do some converting to have it play on our home DVD player, but to our surprise it automatically played on our COBY brand DVD player--no converting needed (for DVD player from the US--player is NTSC format).  Great price from this vendor.  Delivered on time.",1335571200,5,313,4.553571428571429
5053167,5,B0072X9QVM,What a genuinely funny reenactment of how crazy life can get with three young and very precocious children! I wish it was available in DVD format for our region as it just isn't TV on a regular basis:(,1334016000,4,201,4.315789473684211
5053168,5,B0072X9QVM,This one of my favorite shows and would be willing to buy all seasons. Why is season 1 the only one available in Region 1?,1332115200,2,122,3.92
5053169,5,B0072X9QVM,"I actually bought an 'all region' DVD player just so that I could watch this show! It is that good! For those not familiar with ""Outnumbered"", it is an ongoing story of parents trying to deal with one child with teen angst, and another who seems to always be on the lookout for new and exciting ways to wreck things and discomfit adults, as in the chess game and his choice of black, the color of death. And a young girl, Karen, whose unassailable logic provides proof that good people go to hell and bad people go to heaven, or her dealings with someone at the door that she is convinced is a door-to-door salesman. This is simply one of the best shows I have ever seen, and I can watch it time and again. By the way, I ordered my copy from amazon.co.uk for 17GBP (about $27) and got it in 8 days. This is a truly brilliant show, and even if you don't normally like British comedies, give this one a chance. You won't be disappointed.",1330992000,12,935,4.258426966292135
5053170,5,B0072X9QVM,"Elsewhere on Amazon, you can pick up a multi region DVD player for forty bucks, give or take a few; so what's stopping anyone from buying  'Outnumbered' in its Region 2 format - & there are many more non Region 1 format DVDs out there, should you get the urge to try?
I'd heard about the show, but never got around to watching it; & then I caught the Christmas Special.
I was hooked.
I ordered the first three series, & then series 4 as soon as it came out.
It seems like watching extracts from your own family life; I can certainly remember a few instances where the art echoed fact, when my kids were growing up.  It's then when you realise why it is called what it is.
Ramona Marquez (Karen), is simply spectacular; but then all of the cast seem to gel perfectly.
Amazing TV at its very best.
After checking my Series 1 - 3 box set, purchased from Amazon UK, it states that it is Region 1,2 - 4.  The Series 4 box is Region 2 only; whilst the complete Series 1 - 4, which I purchased for friends, is Region 2 & 4",1329696000,8,1015,4.090452261306533
5053171,5,B0072X9QVM,"I have been watching this for sometime on PBS and I agree, hilarious! So bad we cannot get it here in the US. Please, won't someone convert it so we can purchase it? Karen just blows me away, especially when they went out to dinner with their friends and the guy thought he was really something. Met his match in Karen! A five year old! Can't wait each night....Chess match? Tennis anyone? LOL!",1325721600,,394,4.410958904109589
5053172,5,B0072X9QVM,"I saw an episode last night on PBS where the middle son is in a Chess Tournament.  I laughed til tears were streaming down my face.  I decided to buy the series to send to friends and relatives who had not seen it.  I was crushed to find that it is not available in USA format.  It is very special, unique and entertaining! Can't wait to buy it!",1322870400,2,345,4.029411764705882
5053173,5,B0072X9QVM,I caught this show by accident on BBCA and can't get enough.  I would love to get the whole series.  I hope it comes to America soon.,1319760000,2,133,3.888888888888889
5053174,5,B0072X9QVM,"British comedy at its best.
We see into lives of an average family.  Mum and Dad, whose parenting could be judged as unfit, but all too often one might find oneself in them - and giggle guiltily.  The three children, youngest, Karen who asks too many questions and comes up with surprisingly insightful answers, Ben the middle child, as described in the series ""a budding psychopath"" and Jake, the oldest of the three, and the most responsible of the entire family.
Although the plot of each episode is predictable and one can see exactly what will happen from the beginning, it is still a fresh and hilarious piece of comedy.
This comes from a person who is not into comedy at all.
Brilliant, certainly worth watching.",1318636800,4,719,4.698412698412699
5053175,5,B0072X9QVM,LOVE this show and watch it at 11:30 p.m. on PBS whenever I can. How on earth is this not a DVD for the U. S. audience? SO much better than much of the shlock we we have on network television.,1317340800,2,192,3.707317073170732
5053176,5,B0072X9QVM,"This is a very clever series. Clever acting, clever writing, clever direction. If you like a laugh, then this is for you.",1316908800,,121,4.545454545454546
8509074,5,B0072X9QVM,A great show when it started with a great premise. It got a bit predictable towards the end but enjoyable nevertheless!,1525651200,,119,4.714285714285714
8509075,4,B0072X9QVM,"A friend told me I would love this series, and so far, she's been right! The show's design is unique and intriguing: While the adults are given the task of carrying the scripted narrative, the kids ad lib their reactions. Some of their lines are incisive in the brutally honest way only a child's innocent perspective can provide, and some are just flat-out hysterical. The youngest child, Karen (played by Ramona Marquez, who appears to be an old soul in a young body), is especially astute, and she delivers some of the show's best moments. Fans of American humor might complain it's too slow-moving, because the show sometimes lingers on scenes for minutes at a time, and the jokes aren't ""hit you over the head"" blatant. But Anglophiles and fans of shows like ""The Office"" will eat this up.

The one caveat I will issue (and this is why it lost a star): In this box set, the compression is a bit maddening. The resolution appears to be lower than most DVDs I've seen, so the image is noticeably pixelated. Though I try to look beyond that and just enjoy the show, there are times when it's impossible to avoid being distracted by the subpar picture quality.",1514764800,,1161,4.608695652173913

8509077,5,B0072X9QVM,"I binge watched ""Outnumbered"". I couldn't stop watching it...like a huge car wreck. Even though the ending is...lovely....it made me realize it's good that I never had children. Especially interesting to this American-no one shows any physical affection until the last episode in the last season. No one hugs. Or kisses. Or tells anyone else they love them. It's very real and has a lot more substance than most American counterparts. Very British?",1466553600,,448,5.1506849315068495

8509082,5,B0072X9QVM,"Very funny British comedy.  I can see why it is a hit in Britain.  I loaned this series to my friend and she also gave it ""thumbs up"" reviews.  I just got done watching Series 5.  I think the real humor in Series 1-4 had a lot to do with the children being young.  Series 5 dealt with teenagers (Series 5 came out several years after 4) and the young daughter just seemed bratty instead of cute.  I don;t forsee a Series 6.  It has run its course.  I still am glad I watched 5 - it had many funny moments.",1422662400,,505,3.9306930693069306
