7834910,5,6303013058,BRINKE STEVENS!!! Need I say more?,1464048000,,34,4.833333333333333
7834911,4,6303013058,"I liked it a lot. You have  Michael Berryman , Brinke Stevens, in this goofy , funny , and yes very cheeszy movie. A good buy if like b-movies .",1392508800,,144,3.8
7834912,5,6303013058,"Brinke is one of the true ""Scream Queens"" (before every Tom, Dick and Sally started to ripp-off that for their title). and all the cast, from Jay Richardson on down here, turn in some of their best efforts to be an asset to the film (see if you spot the star of Count Yorga Vampire in this).  They don't make these kind of films anymore, and that really is a shame, but maybe they were just the best for the era they grew up in.....but Eddie Dreezen - never out of style.  They don't go for over fancy SFX...no...their purpose, was to entertain you and give you every dollars worth of your time....from the title song, etc.....just a real good time to be had plain old fun exploitation!",1357776000,3,686,4.3515625
7834913,3,6303013058,"So, this movie.... if there was one thing i brought from it was Brinke Stevens about half way thru changes into a really hot dominatrix outfit @_@  It is a fun little movie, by no means take it as even possibly serious.  The comedy is rather dated, but it is a nice throw back to mid 80's cheez.  So, if you want to see Brinke lookin all hot without nudity (though there is some)and up for some supernatural cheese with an 80's flair - go for it!",1347580800,4,446,4.103448275862069
7834914,4,6303013058,"I love Brinke Stevens, and I think this is her finest film.  If you're looking for a serious horror film, don't bother with this DVD.  If you want to see an original, quirky, amusing, and fun B movie, this is a great choice.  If nothing else, you'll be humming the infectious theme song in your head for weeks.",1098057600,,310,4.310344827586207
7834915,5,6303013058,If you love this movie don't pay those stupid over blown prices....for Chirst sake this movie is on DVD already at Fred Olen Rays site!!!!,1080432000,3,138,4.56
7834916,5,6303013058,"there are horror movies, and there are horror movies. i only wish i could get this on DVD! this movie is so funny, and its supposed to be. its not one of those lame hollywood horror-formula movies, its totally original! check it out!
(Brinke Stevens--the main character--also wrote this!)",1014768000,7,288,4.8979591836734695
