7813656,2,6301678125,"This was a documentary about the Russian air force in the immediate post-Soviet era.  The down-at-the-heels air force had been reduced to hiring itself out to wealthy thrill-seekers, selling rides in two-seat fighters.  Even though these aviators had recently been America's enemies, it was still rather sad to see this splendid fighting force moulder like that.
The prowess of the Soviet air force in WWII and Korea is touted in the historical sections of the film.  It is true that the Soviet air force doesn't get enough credit in the West for its feats against the Luftwaffe. Indeed, the air battle over the Kuban sector was as pivotal in the War as was Midway or the Battle of Britain.  But the film leaves the wrong impression that the Soviet MiG-15 had things all its own way in Korea.  It did wreak considerable havoc among UN aircraft, but its main opponent, the North American F-86, enjoyed an overall decisive kill ratio in the skies over Korea, despite many tactical and structural disadvantages.
I had to smile at one segment.  A World War Two Russian ace was being extolled.  At one point a glimpse of his plane was shown.  The craft featured an unusual air intake, on top behind the cockpit.  Though the plane was not identified, this detail marked it as a Bell P-39 Airacobra, on lend-lease from America.",1067299200,,1320,4.754385964912281
