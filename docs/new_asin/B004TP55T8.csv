4465900,5,B004TP55T8,"The dub version for me certainly is much better than the Japanese version for this anime. It's funny and often warms your heart. Even the characters you hate you end up loving because they add to what Baka & Test is all about. Though I was confused about certain characters' relationships with one another in this season, I am happy that all the kids who are within the same group still rely on one another to succeed in competitions in order to maintain their status among the school's other ranks. But this series is more than just people and test scores and status. It is about people beating the odds when things seem hopeless and learning how to work together to succeed as a team while there are some who don't believe in other peoples' capabilities. As stated before, it is a heartwarming series and people learn how to appreciate those who play on the same losing side with them but that doesn't matter when ultimately, only they can count on each other to be there for them in their time of need.",1419552000,,1005,4.497267759562842

4465908,4,B004TP55T8,"The visuals are amazing for a small (At the time) animation studio, and the style of the artwork makes it that much more beautiful to look at. The story isn't going to keep you at the edge of your seat, but it gets the job done, and in a setting like this, it doesn't really need to be dramatic. The humor is the best part by far, and is the main appeal of the show. It is especially funny if you have watched a lot of anime beforehand, as it takes jabs at some typical anime stereotypes. That unfortunately means the characters won't be as deep and complex as most are, but with the type of show this is, you can overlook it. All in all, it's a pretty good watch, and if you like the first few episodes, (which you can watch over at the official FUNimation YouTube) it's definitely worth your money.

So overall:

  + Good visuals
  + Funny humor (especially for long time anime fans)
+/- Different visual style
  - Flat characters
  - Not a good first anime
  - Little/No Story",1406160000,,979,4.260869565217392

I bought the last limited edition for $95!!! Being the last I though it was worth it as these have gone from $60 to $100 before and been out of stock multiple times. To my surprise as I just got it today and I see I have season 2 limited edition (two DVD case in box) and season 1 is one DVD??!! They sent me the standard edition instead of the limited edition. I'm very disappointed saw awhile back they were out of stock because of problem with people getting the wrong product well amazon did not learn from there mistake. And worst of all as of now I can't return it for the proper item I can only get a refund.

Amazon is a great company but this is too far to  SELL A CUSTOMER A $25 ITEM FOR $95!!!

4465930,4,B004TP55T8,"f you were to take anime as art reflecting the real world you would figure Japanese high schools to be places full of huge chested girls, oblivious guys who don't realize that six girls want to pork him, and you'd probably get the idea that Japanese high school kids get nosebleeds upon seeing the cleavage of a woman. These are not actually true as Japanese high schools are not much better than any other high schools and the only reason anime treats high school as a place of fun, violence, chests, and more chests is because it makes high school a much more exciting place than it actually is.

Baka and Test reflects the real world almost as well as the Jersey Shore. It is in fact so opposite of the real world it is probably a mirror dimension. The high school is a place of tests, tests, and more tests. Upon entrance, you take a test that decides what class you will be in, A through F. F is of course the idiots and A is the nerds. F students have to deal with crappy wooden tables and pillows while A gets personal desks, lounge chairs, tables, a refreshment bar, and a giant wall of television screens. Our hero is Yoshi, a complete idiot who has a friend in Himeji, a very smart girl who wound up in the F class for getting sick and leaving during the placement test, thus giving her a zero. Together with their friends in the class they battle their way to the top through the use of avatars. Everyone in the school has one that has stats dependent on how well they do on tests in various subjects. Thus, the higher the grade, the harder their avatars hit. It's pretty much a school version of a JRPG where instead of health potions, students run to take recovery tests during battles to regain lost hit points. It's a rather smart idea I must say and actually works out kind of well. I don't think watching people compare test scores and take tests has been this exciting.

This plot of the underdogs taking on the big guys is of course a clich but works perfectly well here due to the peppering of strange and eclectic characters that ultimately lends this series the comedy aspect it should be known for. The plot is both downright ridiculous and hilarious and while there is not a lot of plot to go around, there is enough to add some semi-serious bits in throughout.

There are a couple of problems with the plot. There is a lot of romance being thrown around and it doesn't really go anywhere. A love letter by a certain character is never given to another certain character despite this love letter being a main point of the plot. Another thing I found was I don't understand the science behind an avatar being hurt and Yoshi feeling it. Nobody else can feel their avatar's being hurt, only Yoshi can because of his terrible scores, but it still seems nonsensical. But that's just a tiny complaint that shouldn't even matter considering I'm watching a show to laugh, not get a deep, engaging, realistic plot.

And I did laugh, and so will you. This show is replete with sexual humor that may turn some people away but when an anime uses Apocalypse Now Redux in a joke, I think it deserves a cookie. On top of that was a random cameo by Miku Hatsune (whose back is turned in Class B) and it also references other anime. Yes, it does have lots of chests. And as I've previously stated, chests do not a good joke make. This anime somehow made me laugh at chests. That's right. I laughed at boob jokes. I didn't laugh at the constant use of Himeji's breasts and Yoshi's sister's breasts as some form of fan service I guess, but I did laugh at Shimada's constantly comparing her breasts to Himeji's and being jealous. The overabundance of boobies also spills over into how characters act, which creates a particularly silly character but we'll talk about him in a moment.

The animation is nothing fantastic. It has this look as if it were a colored-in manga but it's not a style I found particularly appealing. The dots everywhere and the sometimes rather dull colors made it seem like an older anime, maybe 2005-ish. The animation also seemed rather lackluster in the fight scenes where a lot of the time we see an overhead view with little circles representing the characters instead of watching the characters actually fight. While this is not a huge issue, I feel as if the animators were lazy when producing these segments.

Sound quality is actually good. I committed high treason and watched the dub which turned out to be rather pleasant. None of the voices were grating and I felt that it actually kept the integrity of the original script without taking away any of the funny bits. Now the opening and closing on the other hand are another matter altogether. The opening is lame and basic and could have been tacked onto anything. The ending is meh, not bad but not particularly good.

The characters are what make this show what it is. Yoshi is the oblivious idiot, a character archetypical of the genre but hilarious nonetheless. Himeji has big boobs and about as little personality as one would expect from the love interest. Shimada is the hot-headed and overly violent girl who does not like her tiny boobs being made fun of. She likes Yoshi, as does Himeji though they never fight over him. They seem to be a unified effort all the time. The problem with Shimada is the fact that another girl is in love with her and is stalking the crap out of her. The same can actually be said of Yoshi who is being teased by a gay guy from Class A a lot of times.

Class representative of class F, Sakamoto is in a contract with the representative of A, Kirishima. Kirishima wants to marry him and does everything she can to be with him while Sakamoto wants nothing to do with it leading to some hilarious moments.

Hideyoshi is quite possibly one of the most interesting and hilarious characters of the show. A guy who looks like a girl but constantly dresses like a girl for whatever reason. The girls are jealous of how hot he is as a girl and the guys all seem to find him attractive as well. This leads to utter confusion half the time and while Hideyoshi's character is never explained (why does he dress like a girl if he wants to be treated as a guy?) he still provides enough hilarious moments to make that question void.

Finally, Kouta is a hentai who takes pictures of everyone's boobs and panties and is constantly dying of nosebleeds. He has started a book on the boobs of all the girls in the school. He is utterly hilarious.

And we can't forget Iron Man, the remedial class teacher. When a student dies during a battle with their avatars Iron Man swoops in like a superhero and takes them to remedial classes. This guy is freaking great.

There's also Yoshi's sister who seems to want to have sex with him. I won't explain any further because the anime doesn't either.

What else is there to say about this show? It made me laugh every episode and while it may feel a little inconsistent at times (the semi-serious episodes and the flat out comedy episodes aren't mixed together proportionally) it still is one of the most entertaining comedy anime I've seen. Sure it doesn't wrap up tightly, sure it doesn't have an amazing story, but who cares? It's freaking hilarious. The characters are not all original but all together make a memorable group of idiots. The action isn't real well done but is negated by the absolutely laugh out loud writing. There are lots of jiggly boobies for all the fan boys but also a lot of jokes concerning both American and Japanese culture.

It's a fun ride that a fan of comedy anime may want to take if he or she hasn't already. I found it to be more entertaining then it should be, but loved it all the more for that.

4465932,5,B004TP55T8,"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (Baka and Test) is one of the best animes I've seen in two decades of watching Japanese animation. This series is very funny if viewed by the appropriate audience; its a comedy with a harem slant in a school life setting. All episodes are good, at some points you may even laugh out loud, and the story has a decent flow. However, if you are an adult, the dubbed version is unwatchable. As usual, funimation has dumbed down and manipulated the dialog for no discernable purpose other than attempting to make it assessable for younger audiences, and used the same monotone actors whose voices just don't seem fit the characters age, action or expressions at all. I can't comment on the whole dub because I could only stomach two episodes, but previous experience would suggest its pretty bad all the way through. The subtitled version is hilarious and most adults would enjoy it.

4465937,4,B004TP55T8,"Well, I guess a classroom full of mostly delinquents and underachievers *could* qualify as ""beasts"".

A school pilot program where students classes can challenge other classes to attempt to improve their school equipment. The best scoring students get the best equipment, the worst get junk. The challenges are done by holographic ""champions"" or avatars based on the individuals grade in the subject of the teacher monitoring the challenge. So some strategy in choosing the right time, place and teacher are needed. It is overall a pretty good series (both seasons and the OVA) but not the most original characters.

4465940,4,B004TP55T8,"My god, when this anime came out, I was interested with the cute artwork and the story concept and then I ended up being thrown into a wild ride.

This anime is hilarious. I ended up laughing in the first episode and the humor never dies down.

The story is about how students are basically put in classes based on their test scores (ouch I hate to be in that school). The main character Akihisa is apparently the dumbest guy in the entire school getting the worse grade and ending up in the worse class (F) with pretty much every guy there except his childhood friend Minami who is only there because she couldn't read the kanji after coming back from Germany and Himeji who ended up fainting during the test due to getting a cold. There goal the entire series is to defeat Class A and get out of the dump known as Class F.

As the summary suspects, Class F will always have to fail to keep the status quo, but that doesn't stop these action scenes from being cool (as well as the comedy.)

All the characters are surprisingly well developed despite following the stereotype. Actually the anime has a point that if class F stays the way they are, they will never be able to defeat Class A so they have to step up their game and develop in order to win and it shows a lot in this series (and the novel does a great job expanding on the characters personalities and backstories). I think the main character Akihisa is the best example of character development. He's the biggest idiot in the series and by maintaining the status quo has actually caused problems for the people around him to the point that his older sister had to move in with him to take care of him (since at the beginning, he doesn't have enough money to pay for anything given he spends it on video games...sounds like me!) Akihisa has shown that despite being an idiot he is talented in other fields such as cooking and if he actually DOES study, he can get a higher score on a test. In the novel, he actually ends up getting good at history to the point that his summon has evolved to the point of being able to beat people in history (he develops a love for history in the novel similar to how Minami's strong point is math and Kouta's strong point is health and PE).

With that said, I must confess there is ONE FLAW that makes me rank this anime down. The humor is hilarious, but I think the problem is the double standard that is involved in the comedy. All the males tend to get the blunt of all bad things happening to them, but if everything was gender reversed, it wouldn't be funny (unless the entire school was full of girls). And it gets to the point where you actually feel bad for Akihisa and Yuuji and start to hate the female characters who can brake their bones, poison them and get off scott free despite them starting the problem. I generally hate Shoko as a result. People love her because she's a ""moe-moe yandere"" but she's a straight up ""Jerk Sue"" and all the things she does to Yuuji is straight up domestic abuse. Yes I laugh when she tasers him and drags him to the movie theaters and I do feel sorry for Yuuji when she burned his porn (I still laughed at that), the things that I don't find funny are her poking him in the eye because he wasn't looking in her direction by chance (I hate yandere characters like this), breaking into his house (privacy woman), trying to drown him and then resurrect him (NOT FUNNY. That could have actually killed him compared to the taser) and then trying to force him into marriage multiple times (I don't find this funny because if they're married, that means, she's free to do whatever she wants with him and since she has attempted to get into his pants...I shiver at the thought) and even though the series is saying that Yuuji deserves this treatment and he should be lucky to have a beautiful girl like Shoko, episode 7 was basically everyone saying that this type of abuse is okay and tried to give her a sympathetic moment. My answer is no. Someone like this does not deserve sympathy and most of her antics aren't funny.

Alas, this is a funny anime all and all and more people like Shoko than I do (but I hate yandere characters in general) and should watch/buy it whenever you have the time.",1361836800,2,4233,4.358681875792142

4465946,4,B004TP55T8,"Yoshii is good-hearted, but kinda dumb. His school is divided into six class levels for each year. The students are placed in their class according to their test scores. A is the highest and F is the lowest. Yoshi is in class F. The students at the school settle their differences by battling with avatars. The winners get school equipment from the losers. Because of this, class F uses cardboard boxes for tables and doesn't have chairs. Despite being a class of dummies, there are some pretty interesting characters in class F. 2 of them happen to be pretty girls, and they both have a crush on Yoshi. One of them is a tomboy that is pretty much catnip for lesbians, and the other is a sweet and charming girl that every guy is nuts over. One of these girls may just win Yoshii's affections, but will he have to survive the avatar battles and stave off hunger before he can focus on that stuff.

This anime is pretty fun. There are some interesting characters, and some great comedy. The animation is really great, and the soundtrack is cool. My only complaint with this one is the story. Baka and Test doesn't really have one. It's basically just goofiness. There's nothing wrong with that. School Rumble proves that an anime can survive off of goofiness, but this is nowhere near that funny. This series could easily be awesome, but the lack of drama halts it at above average. I do like this series, but it's not as good as all the hype. I do recommend watching it through Netflix of Youtube. It's an enjoyable watch. You may decide to buy it after seeing it.

funny, good animation, mental storyline.

Cons:
the wait for series 2 dvd release

Other Thoughts:
BAKA TO TEST is a very simple story about a boy who is a member of a school were class differences are settled using summoned beast's/avatars that vary in strength depending on test scores.
the story follows the boy's plight to help a fellow classmate (who suffers somewhat from ill health) to move to a better classroom were she won't be affected by things like moldy tatami mats.
what follows is a very funny anime full of over the top quirky characters that beggar belief.
i highly recommend this to every one and i personally cant wait for series 2.
a word of warning to people don't be put off buying because of region issues,
i was a bit annoyed thinking that i was buy blu-ray DVDs that would be of no use to me
but it seems funimation is learning to appreciate their U.K customers as both the DVDs and blu-ray disc's are regions 1,2&4 the blu-rays worked in my PS3 and the DVDs worked in my laptop(the only non multi-region DVD player in my house)
Would you recommend this title: Yes",1333584000,,1096,4.50251256281407

4465955,2,B004TP55T8,"I enjoyed Baka & Test when I started watching the show. It looks cute, has a fun and colorful cast of characters, and I still really like the first ending song. But, by the fourth episode I was tired of it all. The story wasn't going anywhere and the same old jokes were coming up leaving me more irritated than amused.

Baka & Test is primarity a comedy, and most of the time their jokes contain dark humor and or hyperbole. For example, one girls cooking is so bad it kills people, and when a particularly pervy boy catches a glimpse of a girls underwear the resulting noseblead is so massive he is left lying in a pool of his own blood.

There really isn't much to Baka & Test besides it's humor. It's kind of like a sitcom. A school segregates their students by inteligence and has this virtural system where students battle each other using avatars who gain power from their test scores. Everything following the set up is more or less a string of jokes. I would have enjoyed Baka & Test a lot more if the characters were more likeable and if the show contained better jokes or at least ones that were less repetitive. But, because the show is what it is I was irritated by a majority of the show and find it to be below average in quality.",1331769600,3,1245,4.293617021276596
4465956,4,B004TP55T8,"Baka to Test is a simple show that illustrates how funny anime can be. This anime has a juvenile sense of humor with lots of slapstick gags. Just like you would think of a mainly comedy orientated anime, the plot is there to provide a driving for the story, but overall it's mostly to help string along more humor.
With every battle in this series, they add more humor because they add something wacky or extreme. Really, every episode is enjoyable and if you have a sense of humor, you'll get a good laugh out of it. The plot might be a bit simple but it does exactly what it needs to, to keep the show going strong.

The characters are a bit one dimensional, usually only having one or two traits to go upon. But that works for this anime. Though some of the characters are a bit clich, you still feel like there is something special about each and every one of them. All in all, the characters are rather interesting for this comedy anime. I honestly don't think I hated any character in this series, which is hard to do for anime. (I normally hate at least one). There are tons of characters to pick from so you are bound to find at least a few you'll find hilarious.

Lastly, the sound and art in this series are fantastic. Looking and sounding good isn't a priority or achievement these days. But you will really have to enjoy the artistic style of this series. I don't know how to describe it well, but there is this good weirdness to it. Needless to say, it was very nice artwork that left me dumbfounded.

A BIT OF A SPOILER:

While this anime did have fan service in it, I was very much surprised at one male character that has a crush on another male character. It was a lovely change, and with this change it added a bit extra to the comedy of it.

Over all, I would give this anime 4 stars because everything but the bit over top fan service was amazing.",1331769600,,1867,4.262711864406779
4465957,3,B004TP55T8,"Baka & Test isn't quite the greatest anime but it definitely isn't anything to brush off entirely. The show consists of a class that didn't do so well on a test but have great potential. Yet the most interesting part of the show can seem as the fact that they sometimes summon avatars to battle over academic scores. As interesting as it is though they seem to let it fall by the way side and not use it much besides for moving the plot along, if you can call it that, and random bits where they try to use them in a clever way but those moments are short lived and usually are a bit of a disappointment. Though that doesn't much matter since the story isn't all the gripping, and it wasn't made to be that way I believe.  The humor is a bit flat for the most part but it does have a variety of moments that can get a good chuckle. The running gags on a couple characters are sometimes fairly effective. One such situation is where a guy that looks like a girl and everyone completely ignores his attempts to tell anyone he is actually a guy.

The characters can carry themselves quite well sometimes, such as the photographer which his camera's zoom and lens attachment sometimes represents his... excitement which the lens will droop when there is disappointment. Though some characters are pretty dull. When a characters running gag is she is a terrible cook, that never seemed to be funny to me but as always it is a matter of what kind of comedy you like.

The art is actually quite impressive considering the content. It is very bubbly and cute. I almost feel this anime was aimed at females as their is quite a bit of yaoi or gay jokes, which are surprisingly not that bad and are some of the funnier bits, but that can only go so far. The art does have a real nice pop to it as the shadows and backgrounds sometimes are littered with dirty jokes or a real nice style of shading. Almost as though it were a comic book with those dots they use. Also the movement of the characters is real fluid and nice. Not just talking about bouncing boobs and fan service either. When people talk they don't tend to have still frames with just a moving mouth. The characters bounce around and more during dialogue for the most part and that is something that I can appreciate.

The comedy contained in this show is mainly based on over the top idiocy. I can appreciate that if done right but I felt myself grinding through episodes just find the next bit that made me chuckle. Overall this isn't necessarily a show to be avoided but not one I would suggest seeking out unless you want something completely mindless with good art. Also I might suggest it for females that aren't too deep into anime possibly. The story is so thin that it actually has the advantage over most anime by not taking itself seriously and is not heavy handed in anyway. While some anime go for a feeling like they are trying to educate the viewer on the views of the creator or they are trying to tell a deep emotional story. That doesn't always carry over to the average person so this show would be great for an inattentive person, people into cute funny and sometimes yaoi comedy?, and something that won't turn someone off because they feel as the show is lecturing them about something.",1330905600,2,3260,4.401326699834162

4465965,2,B004TP55T8,"I purchased this after reading all the positive reviews, but was disappointed by this show. Many of the characters seemed almost to be caricatures rather than having depth. Cliched jokes common to anime were often reused. The fanservice-laden humor was not really that enjoyable or what I was looking for. Many of the characters were more disturbing than funny -- do we really need another show with a character like Shouko and her behavior towards Yuuji as humor? I seriously considered quitting the show after the early episodes.

That being said, I did finish the series, some parts were funny, and the last few episodes were better than the beginning. I'd give it a 2.5/5 if fractions were allowed, but as is, I can't recommend this show at all for an older audience or anyone looking for something innovative.",1317427200,2,814,4.856115107913669
4465966,5,B004TP55T8,"Baka and test follows the story of class F. They go to a unique school where classes are split based on test scores. The best students get all the money and equipment in class A, while the worst students get stuck with nothing in Class F. However, students can earn better supplies and equipment by quite literally battling other classes, using their test scores as their battle points.

This anime is absolutely hilarious, filled with tons of visual gags. This is the first anime I have ever watched that I would have no problem watching again and again. I watched one episode twice in a row, and found tons of hilarious things I had completely missed the first time through.

The season, in and of itself, is very satisfying. The story starts out strong, sits for most of the mid season, but with good reason, and then ends strongly. You will most likely be satisfied with the ending to. There is another season in progress, but I wonder what will happen to continue the series, which seems to have finished up pretty well.

There is not any complete nudity although the anime possesses of some partial nudity. The language is OK as well. The comedy is often very visual with a fair amount of slapstick too.

4465971,5,B004TP55T8,"This anime is awesome, hilarious and a personal favourite. I recommend it to everyone but the main reason im writing this review is to point out to all potential international buyers that this is a Multi Regional set. Ill write a longer review after i give it a rewatch and check out the dubs. Ive only watched the japanese version so far but that was very good so i hope the dubs can do the original version justice.

Update:
I was under the impression that the limited edition was supposed to come with some kind of magnetic dry erase board. Its advertised as being included on most other sites selling this edition but i didn't recieve anything so i don't think amazon is doing this promotion. Which means that you are basically being charged around $25 extra (at the time of writing this) for a thicker box. You might as well go for the standard edition and pick up another box set of another anime with the money you will have saved.

First impressions of the english dub aren't good. A few voices suit the roles but most of the important ones don't fit in my opinion. Another thing i noticed, assuming the fan subs i watched are accurate translations, is that the dialogue seems to have gone from something with a 15 rating to a PG in the english dubs so a lot of scenes that are hilarious in the original just seem lame, and embarassing with the childish funimation dialogue. Im going to give the whole series another watch in a few weeks with the english dubs on (i switched to subs after a few episodes because i just wasn't enjoying it as much) and see if they grow on me.",1312502400,2,1582,4.395904436860068

So the show doesn't leave you unfulfilled and wishing for more or for another direction.  It was executed about as good as it could be.

At 13 episodes, it's worth watching as it's not that large of an investment of your time for a pretty good experience.

8440785,5,B004TP55T8,"You might go in expecting a shounen harem series, specifically of the Unwanted & No Romantic Resolution variety, but the humor seems to be predominantly aimed at women. The story starts off focusing on school battles &romance, but it's eventually dropped in favor of gay jokes, crossdressing, & female-on-male comedic violence.

*Akihisa: The main character. The world's 2ed most unlucky chew toy & fall-guy. Frequently forced to crossdress against his will.
*Hideyoshi: Every boy in school has a crush on him, no exceptions. Master of drag. Frustrated no one will treat him like a boy.
*Himeji: Yandere, wolf in sheep's clothing, fujoshi, terrible cook, one of the smartest kids in school, collects photos of Akihisa in drag.
*Minami: Tsundere who expresses all emotions through brutal torture. Also seems to have a fondness for Akihisa in drag.
*Akira: Yandere, fujoshi, terrible cook, extremely possessive & jealous. Has an incestuous fixation on her little brother.
*Hazuki: Little girl with a huge crush on Akihisa.
*Kubo: A guy who has a huge crush on Akihisa in or out of drag.
*Yuuji: Ahikisa's best friend, group strategist, the muscle, & the unfortunate chew toy of Shouko.
*Shouko: Violent expressionless Kuudere who's forcing Yuuji into a relationship against his will. Fond of blackmail.
*Muttsurini: Voyeur photographer who has a crush on every girl he sees (except Kudou). Makes money selling pictures of his friends in drag.
*Kudou: Sultry girl with a one-sided crush on Muttsurini.
*Miharu: In love with her sister & horribly jealous of Akihisa.
*Yuuko: Tsundere, fujoshi, one of the smartest students. Despite being identical to Hideyoshi, no one seems to have a crush on her.
