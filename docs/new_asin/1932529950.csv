7801535,5,1932529950,"I borrowed this dvd using the interlibrary loan system. I really wanted to see it because I knew several of the speakers are leaders with cutting edge ideas and perspectives on how diagnosed person and caregiver can continue to live joyful, purposeful life in spite of the disease.  Richard Taylor is well known as a diagnosed person who is a writer and speaker about how it feels to have alzheimer's and how people with dementia want to be treated.  Al Powers and Bill Thomas are doctors and leaders in field of creating care facilities that provide happy, purposeful, engaging environments, by training staff and counseling family caregivers. Judy Berry opened two care facilities of her own after seeing the untrained care her mother received and the devastating effect it had on her mother's daily life - her facililites are models for true person centered care for people with dementia, and use care approaches which nearly eliminate the use of sedating drugs by understanding the needs of residents judged aggressive by other less educated care facilities.  These were the four speakers whose work I am familiar with.

I was not familiar with Mona Johnson or Sarah Rowan - both were family caregivers.  They and Richard Thomas let us in on how they and their families handled various parts of the journey, to good and the bad, and what they would do different. It's an education of their experiences and I found it interesting and very helpful.

I plan to buy this dvd and use it for community education presentations. I think it's a great resource, giving people a realistic AND HOPEFUL look at what lies ahead - not the usual gloom and doom which drags so many diagnosed people and their caregivers down.  It's a 2 dvd set - two hours of interviews organized well.

The panel was not actually together when they were asked the questions - they were asked to respond without knowing what other panel members said, so they could give their own view without being influenced by other comments. The questions are asked in the order below; they switch between panel members for each question. The approaches to answers are different, interesting.

I think the blurb on the back cover is true:
""Not all these answers agree with each other. Much like life, depending on your own personal knowledge and experience you must make up your own mind, your own answers. Watching this dvd should help you do this quicker, and you should feel surer about your own opinions/answers.""
