1862268,1,B00008RH0U,"Don't think of these as adult movies, think of them as slow death.  These movies were made back in the 50's or 60's when nudity was thought of as forbidden.  What these movies are are comedies (though not very funny) but with some women losing their cloths.  All you will see are breast (nice and natural) and butts (fat by today's standards).  That's all you'll see.  Pubic hair was too risky so you won't see any in this film.
I bought this DVD for only one reason, Fanny Hill, and this isn't the Fanny Hill I grew up watching.  This one was ugly.  If you're gonna bye this one, spend as little money on it as you can.",1068249600,35,620,4.203389830508475
1862269,4,B00008RH0U,"Something Weird comes up trumps again with this new double-feature with a 'fairy tale' theme.  Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a wild and wacky ride!
SINDERELLA AND THE GOLDEN BRA (directed by Loel Minardi):  Beautiful Derella (Suzanne Sybele) is mistreated horribly by her evil Stepmother (Patricia Mayfield) and her two stepsisters Flossy (June Faith) and Fanny (Joan Lemo).  When the handsome Prince David (Bill Gaskin) decides to throw a royal ball in search of a wife, Derella's 'Fairy Godfather' (Sydney Lassick - ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) climbs through her window and gives her a beautiful new dress, a coach and a golden brassiere.
At the stroke of midnight, Derella flees, leaving the lovestruck Prince holding her gilded B-cups...so he decides to try the bra on all the eligible maidens in the land, to track down his beloved.
Totally campy, and oh-so-enjoyable.  Believe it or not, the otherwise-crappy score includes a few delights, including Derella's ""My Day is On It's Way"" and the Stepsister's ""Pity, It Couldn't Be You"".  The transfer of the film is the only blackspot, with a badly-damaged print on offer here (the only complete print in existence, apparently).  Sound quality varies, with a distinct humming sound evident towards the end of the film.
GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BARES (directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis):  Lovely Allison (played by B-movie starlet Vicki Miles) mysteriously leaves her boyfriend every weekend to attend a nudist camp.  Not a lot of story on offer here but quite a bit of flesh, with Bill Kerwin, Rex Marlow, Mal Arnold, Delores Carlos and Craig Maudslay Jr. all getting into the act.  The very first 'nudist-camp musical', it is quite enjoyable with a few good numbers like ""Half a Dream"" and ""That Night When We Were Young"".  The print for the film is a thousand times better than the SINDERELLA print, coming directly from the original EastmanColor film-stocks.  Colors are nicely-saturated and the 2-channel stereo mix serves its purpose.  Turn on the audio commentary for yet another hilarious chat with David  Friedman and Mike Vraney (joined by Frank Henenlotter).
But, for a real good time, skip GOLDILOCKS and head straight for the extra features.  There are trailers for ""Sinderella"" and ""Goldilocks"", as well as trailers for ""The Adventures of Lucky Pierre"", ""Boin-n-n-g!"", ""Bunny Yeager's Nude Camera"", ""Calendar Pin-Ups"", ""French Without Dressing"", ""Not Tonight Henry"" and ""She Should Have Stayed in Bed"" (which features both Audrey Campbell and Gigi Darlene)
Even better are the fantastic short-subjects, which include:
CINDERELLA'S LOVE LESSON:  50's stripping-queen Lili St. Cyr plays a bored Cindy who is visited by a floating magic wand.  Her stuffed cat is turned into a fur coat and she finds jewelry in her soup!  At midnight all her clothes disappear in front of a very-shocked Prince.  Utterly hilarious!
GOLDIELOCKS GOES GLAMOROUS:  A young girl in a bikini wanders into a neighbor's backyard and takes a dip in their pool.  She is then scared off by another bikini-clad lovely wearing a stuffed bear's head!
THIS DIARY BELONGS TO FANNY HILL:  A lovely blonde Fanny recounts her day's adventures seducing men while posing in front of her mirror doing a striptease.  (Directed by Barry Mahon).
NUDE IN THE WINDOW:  Three bored New York girls devise ways how to catch the attention of a handsome male neighbor through their apartment window.
DOUBLE TROUBLE:  Darlene Bennett (BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL) shares the screen with her sister Rita in this hilarious short where the 'grueseome twosome' switch places while seducing a prospective new boyfriend.
THE SUPER DREAMS:  Extra-long featurette (27 minutes) about a bored janitor who envisions himself a producer auditioning several naked girls for a movie.
There's also a gallery of magazine covers set to the theme-music of BOOBY-TRAP.
For more Something Weird madness, I also recommend the double-features ""The Notorious Daughter of Fanny Hill/The Head Mistress"", ""Bad Girls Go to Hell/Another Day Another Man"", ""The Violent Years/Girl Gang""; and the triple-feature disc of ""Olga's House of Shame/Olga's Dance Hall Girls/White Slaves of Chinatown"".",1056931200,78,4183,5.216741405082212
7986907,2,B00008RH0U,"I bought this only because I acted in a summer play for several years in the late 70s with Rex Marlow, the lead in ""Goldilocks."" (Plus that is one of the all time greatest movie posters!) OMG is it awful! ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" looks like ""Casablanca"" in comparison. The production quality is so poor and you couldn't find worse actors! Although I do have to say I thought Rex's singing was pretty good (even though he did a poor job of lip synching his own songs). Then I watched ""Sinderella"". Clever plot with the bra vs. the slipper right? Very funny. Oh no, it was even worse. Honestly, just painful. Neither show really has all that much nudity and what it has does not make up for the rest. Plus there is one rather disturbing scene in ""Sinderella"" where one girl trying on the bra looks about 13 years old. The only reason it gets as many as 2 stars is the commentary for ""Goldilocks"" is very informative and entertaining. Producer Freidman gives a nice history of the nudie camp movies and some other good stories. He clearly despised Rex! So if you are really into this type of movie and are forced to watch I just say have cocktails in hand and watch/listen to the commentary.",1398902400,,1189,4.433789954337899

7986909,2,B00008RH0U,these moves going form the cover I like big hooters and so I thought from the box I might get to see the women without her arms folded. but it was a disappointment the nudity in these films puts them in the noth worth buying bin. if you are looking for a nice little fun film then you may like this film but if your looking for some tits and ass not wasth your money.,1363737600,,367,3.9066666666666667
7986910,3,B00008RH0U,"If you're looking for sexual interaction, this is the WRONG movie for you. You'll never even see a full frontal nude scene. The girls are beautiful and for a 50' style flick, it would be considered a pg-17, but not an R and definitely not an X.
If you're into just T&A, you're in the right spot, because that's ALL you get to see. If this is sold for more than $3.00, you wasted your money, unless you like that stuff.",1326844800,4,418,4.172839506172839
7986911,3,B00008RH0U,"My copy costed 5 dollars so please unless you get this price or less, don't buy this set. The movies are promoted as porn and adult however i would say they barely made the r rating. That maybe the most disappointing point in this set... for most people but not me.

  Putting the points above aside i really did enjoy this 2 movies. I found them very funny and entertaining (you see i love cheesy movies). So if you find this cheap i would say ""Go for it"" for and enjoyable 3 hours of comedy 60s style.",1308787200,3,503,4.164948453608248
7986912,1,B00008RH0U,"This movie is horrible, badly acted and is by today's standards a R rated movie.  Dont waste time or money on it, wish I hadn't!",1304640000,,128,4.12
7986913,3,B00008RH0U,"Herschell Gordon Lewis's ""Goldilocks and the Three Bares"" is a funny and campy film about nudism and relationships. It is a cheerful, likeable film about a group of work collegues who try nudism, enjoy its liberating effects and find their friendship reaffirmed.
Bill Kerwin is especially funny as a comedian with a smart crack for everything. The films is padded out with an overlong mude cruise on the river, but you will enjoy this 1960s grindhouse oddity.
I'm pleased, however, that Mr Lewis movied on from nudies. There really is only such much you can milk out of this genre.
I didn't especaially go for ""Sindarella"", but I was surprised that the songs were pretty good for this kind of film. If you liked ""Flesh Gordon"" you will probably like this. The ""Golden Bra"" angle is a funny take on the Cindarella story. I suppose the ideas are funnier than the actual execution of them.",1281225600,3,886,4.72258064516129
7986914,4,B00008RH0U,"Cinderella (or in this case, Sinderella)as a nudie musical.  Just when you think you've seen it all, this little gem comes along.  I wish I would have thought of this.  I can't elaborate on anything more than what has already been written by other reviewers with the exception of the fact that everybody in the cast looks like they are having a blast.  As usual in these types of films, Russ Meyer buxotic, Althea Currier, makes an appearance as one of the King's Ladies in Waiting, assisting him with his knitting hobby.  She also appears as the village maiden who is too busty to properly fit into the golden bra.  Depending on your frame of mind the day you watch this, you may think of this film as a classic.",1248220800,11,713,4.446153846153846
7986915,1,B00008RH0U,This is a thumbs down for Something Weird as far as I'm concerned.  I purchased this one because the others I have purchased where not to bad.  Sorry I got this one.,1214179200,2,165,4.125
7986916,4,B00008RH0U,"It's old, the script is horrible, the acting is worse, the storyline is like a bad joke...In other words, it's a perfect ""Something Weird"" video; so bad that it's good. And it has naked chicks. Great double feature if you're a fan of these cheap, ""B"", slightly naughty films.",1183420800,14,275,4.63265306122449
