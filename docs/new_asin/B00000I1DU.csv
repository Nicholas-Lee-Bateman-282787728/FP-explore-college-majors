1218240,5,B00000I1DU,"This is a superb movie and remains a cult classic in U.K. movie circles. For the cinematography alone, it deserves to be reissued on DVD as much as some e.g. Tarkovsky movies: this is Nicholas Roeg at his best with deep  rich use of color and his trademark flashbacks/forwards. Intermittent  corner-of-the-eye glimpses of red become a metaphor for childlike innocence  and eventually horror. The night sequences in Venice are frightening and  beautiful at the same time. Right to the end, the viewer is left wondering  whether they've seen a horror movie or a sad movie about the supernatural,  or both. I've seen it 5 times over 20 years but never grew tired of it.  Would be great to have it on DVD.",951091200,5,701,4.69672131147541

1218244,1,B00000I1DU,"Although Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland deliver fine performances, the story is a slog to get through. I fell asleep three times, before I was able to get to the ending. Their daughter in a red mac, drowns in a pond in England. They move to Venice and Julie Christie's character meets a blind lady who tells her the dead girl is there with her. A killer is on the loose in Venice. Now the spoilers, so stop reading if you ever want to subject yourself to this tedium.

Donald Sutherland's character starts catching glimpses of a ""girl"" in a red mac, resembling his dead daughter. The film drags on and on until he chases down the ""girl."" She turns and we see she is an adult woman dwarf. What the hell? Why would she be wearing a red mac just like his dead daughter. It just makes no sense.

1218256,5,B00000I1DU,"Exceptionally well made suspense movie with a surprise ending.  One of the best movies of its genre, combining beautiful cinematography, acting and a brilliant script to make this a great movie.  Don't Look Now requires the viewer to pay close attention to the film from the very opening shot to the ending and after you ""see"" it all, everything falls together.  Although it probably is best described as a suspense movie, the movie definitely has a horror aspect to it as the main protagonist is slowly drawn to a grisly ending.  When I saw this film many years ago, the ending was about as terrifying as any that I had seen in a movie theater.

Definitely a must-see if you appreciate a great film that delivers at the end.  Today's suspense movies just can't hold up to this as they tend to rely too much on gore and special effects, instead of solid storytelling and acting.",1473033600,4,878,4.596153846153846

If not that, than the ridiculous amounts of tweed both of them wear, even during the juper edited sex scenes...  Seriously.  If not tjose, then the fact that Donald Sutherland is constandly balancing on tiny stilts of wood, ala Cirque de Solei, while lifting and installing huge statues in an old church.  Venice is literally chock full of staging and proper construction rigs, yet he's doing high wire walks in leather platform boots.

1218281,4,B00000I1DU,"A moody period piece (the 70s!) set in Venice, Italy (one of my favorite places). The director makes the most of the city's haunting passageways. Venice was a much lonelier place back then in the decades prior to the rise of China and Russia's middle class tourists who now flood the streets of Europe's top destinations no matter what season of the year. This film unwittingly captures that, too. I was confused by the title and thought it was a horror film but it is more of a realistic film about the nature of tragedy and grief with a weird twisted subplot of a serial killer thrown in. One gets the sense that they were influenced by the feel and box office popularity (not the plot) of Rosemary's Baby and Psycho but they fail to deliver the goods. It's a little too weak and mashed together.  Anyway, the fashions are terrific and Julie Christie looks like she stepped off the pret a porter runways of Paris. Donald Sutherland at his youthful peak. The pair have a fully nude and very long sexual encounter which probably deemed this to the ""European Art Film"" category back when it debuted. I missed seeing this film in the 70s when I was a college student in NYC. Glad I finally saw it thanks to Amazon Prime.",1470009600,,1218,4.486486486486487

1218285,3,B00000I1DU,"Decent story, good acting, bad directing.
A slow burner that fails to build much of any tension. The director relies heavily on symbolism, spirituality, and precognition, particularly jumping between scenes past and present in the attempt to utilize these symbols and ideas of premonition. However, it's not particularly effective - instead of adding to, it takes away from the story and tension. Much less of that would perhaps be the sweet spot. Even character development seemed to be lacking, which absolutely should have been strong in a movie like this.

You could say that all of these flashbacks and flashforwards constructed the main character's supernatural vision that he was struggling with. But I still believe it was handled poorly, and overall detracted from the flow of the film. In the director's favor, we could say he was tackling a subject, and at an angle, very difficult to express in this medium.

Sure, it's a little more cinematically engaging than most horror films, and Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are well-qualified leads, but overall it's pretty dated and cannot to compare to true horror classics like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. Roger Ebert considered it a masterpiece, which has to count for something, and it's widely considered a classic of British cinema, but I simply don't share that view. In 2012, Edgar Wright (a terrific director) submitted a list of his ten favorite films to Sight & Sound, and Don't Look Now was on his list, next to masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Psycho, and Taxi Driver. (Wright, a Brian De Palma fan, also included Carrie, a flawed but superior horror classic from that era.)

When Roeg's film was released, it attracted a considerable amount of controversy because of a sex scene between the two leads. It was considered graphic and borderline pornographic, but I found it gratuitous and borderline dull. No moralistic objection here; it just felt superfluous and tacked-on, with some pretty cheesy editing. (Incidentally, a quick glance at the IMDb trivia page reveals that Roeg conceived the sex scene at the last minute because he thought there were two many scenes of the couple arguing. The scene was shot quickly and mostly improvised, which seems to suggest that while it may not have been created just for the sake of drumming up controversy, it was also made without considerable care or effort.)

In slight defense of the film, I do find the ending truly horrifying. The last five or ten minutes are brilliant and I've probably never been more terrified during a film, but it's too late by that point; for most of the film, the scares simply don't land and the suspense just feels off. Most of the film is scare-free and tonally a mess, and to the extent that it worked in 1973, it just doesn't hold up today. Some films work when they're released and hold up years later (like Badlands, The Exorcist, and Scenes from a Marriage, all from the same year), and some films don't, and Don't Look Now is in the latter category; it's a classic whose time has simply come and gone.",1421798400,3,2250,4.811369509043928

A couple experiences a serious life loss.
They decide to relocate to the watery depths of Venice, where a very mysterious killer is on the loose.

1218445,3,B00000I1DU,"If the Time Life Book Club ran a hundred minute commercial, I imagine it would play out a lot like this film.

Somewhere... on an English manor... a young girl wearing a bright red Mackintosh slips and falls into a bog... 500 feet away, her father simultaneously spills his water-based beverage on a photographic slide bearing an image of an unknown figure (likewise sporting a hooded, red coat) causing it to bleed. Has his daughter just drown?

Do coincidences like this terrify you? If so, buckle yourself in: you've just stumbled upon the cinematic version of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. For the rest of us, however, the excruciatingly slow buildup and, at times, discombobulated editing make for a rather artificial feeling of suspense. Compared to other '70s-era supernatural thrillers such as the Exorcist, the Omen, Burnt Offerings or even the Sentinel, Don't Look Now - sans some peculiar nude scenes (such as Sutherland brushing his teeth in front of a mirror) - kind of plods along like a made-for-television drama. At least unlike other films from the decade leading with the dreaded ""Don't"" in their titles, this one has some redeeming qualities.

A gritty, decaying portrait of Venice provides a visually interesting backdrop to the story and with the exception of the grotesquely overacted opening sequence, the overall performances returned by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are solid. Unfortunately for the former, a perversely reluctant psychic in the film, continued ignorance to the obvious ultimately leads to his character's demise. Moreover, throughout this internal struggle (which takes an unnecessarily long time to unfold), the viewer is practically beaten over the head with transparent symbolism and murky atmosphere.

The sum of its parts is much greater than the film as a whole; as such, the many positive reviews of Don't Look Now should come as no surprise. Because of its plethorically artistic qualities, it's a risky piece of which to be critical.",1388880000,3,1984,5.1713395638629285

Anyway, the visual quality is outstanding. Even in the theater, this movie has always looked soft. Not here. Although, in some scenes, the grain gets a little heavier, overall, it's amazing to see this movie this clearly.

1218471,4,B00000I1DU,"Nicolas Roeg's moody atmospheric psychic thriller Don't Look Now is one of the most unique explorations of the subject of grief that I have seen in quite a while. Controversial upon release in 1973 the film holds up quite well and is recognized as a classic of the English horror genre.

After the drowning death of their young daughter the Baxters (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) leave their English home for Venice where John has found work restoring a church. His wife Laura meets there two old women, Heather(Hilary Mason) and her blind sister Wendy(Clelia Matania). Wendy claims that she can receive messages from the deceased daughter who is now happy but feels that her father is in danger.

What follows is a showcase of the unexpected and the movie fits together like an elaborate puzzle with the viewer having to piece together the clues in order to get to the ensd of the journey. The director's desire was to present a realistic view of how a couple deals with grief and how it can force them apart even while they remain together. The film was extremely controversial upon its release due primarily to an explicit love scene between the couple that is intercut with scenes of the couple preparing for dinner.

The film uses both editing and location work in Venice to create a mood of impending doom. The other key feature here is represented by the line:""Things are not always as they seem."" The film is filled with twists and in order to get the most out of the film it takes a careful viewing or several repeat viewings.

The Optimum Releasing Corporation Blu Ray that I viewed was encoded for Region B and presents a pristine transfer of the film. The sound is good for the most parts but some fluctuations in dialogue make some parts of the film harder to understand than others. This is not a real concern but more a minor annoyance. There are a ton of special features including a commentary track with Roeg, two featurettes, and quite a few interviews with the crew. This is a well put together package of a great film that is unfortunately not often seen. One only hopes that a comparable Region 1 release makes its way to the market soon.

1218474,4,B00000I1DU,"WARNING: This is not your traditional horror film as it's classified a ""horror-thriller"" that seems like a twisted psychological drama mixed with the supernatural. Those looking for splatter, slasher, or linear horror elements should look elsewhere. 1973's Don't Look Now stars Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie who are in Venice while they grieve the loss of their daughter. It seems simple enough but the very idea of losing your children is possibly the most horrifying event a person could experience. Don't Look Now plays that up as Sutherland and Christie are essentially walking into a trap. That's probably what bothers most of the audience about the film and that's all you need to know plot-wise as the couple seeks answers. The ambiance behind the movie suggests there is some ominous evil behind it all and the more curious we get we learn that we all have a price to pay. This flick isn't mentioned much in mainstream horror rankings but is climbing in hardcore horror fans Top 100 rankings because of how unusual it is. If you are comfortable watching 70s atmospheric and tension building films then this could be right up your alley. This 1973 release actually has good acting and production values. It has aged well when compared to its peers like Black Christmas. The film knows what it wants to do to you. It was released near the same time as films like Wicker Man, Black Christmas and Carrie. So if the pacing, music or makeup of those films bothers you then you may want to give this a pass. There is a generation gap over the issue of pacing as the wonderful lack of a formula in the 1970s is in full swing here. Anything goes so you can either move with it or turn to Saw for harder horror.

This is admittedly lighter horror similar to its peers The Haunting or The Changeling. The slasher or zombie movie wasn't really yet in full force just yet in 1973 so many odd tricks are seemingly played on the viewer. One does not know what to make of this film. If it is a thriller as billed then it could be the Best Thriller since Freaks (without the shock value). The value of this film lies in its ability to build suspense and create tension. The plot doesn't matter much as little is really explained to you. We follow Sutherland around trying to make sense of it all. Bizarre things happen with no reason at all. It's perfect for its era. It reminds me of The Deer Hunter in some odd way (remember the wedding scene?). If you liked Sutherland in Invasion of the Body Snatchers he does a remarkable job here as well.

What the Film is Really About: The director wants you to feel like you are there and not watching a movie. Sometimes we don't hear things very clearly and struggle to make sense of it all. Some see that as lazy directing when it works as sheer genius. We identify with the likeable Sutherland. We experience what he does, see what he does and feel how he does (more frustrated, confused, angry and seeking answers). Sutherland running around the Venice canals at night are amongst the most striking, intense and claustrophobic of early 70s horror as we are rushed towards a thrilling climax. While it moves slow early on just enough happens to keep our interest. If you manage to make it to the end of the movie in this ""Solaris of Horror"" and are enjoying it all there is a good payoff. I have seen the film only 3 times where I have managed to completely forget it, stumble upon it and was genuinely not expecting the ending. I'm not sure how anyone could expect it without knowing it in advance. There is absolutely no warning and it's delightful. The ending does leave many questions unanswered. Perhaps that's what makes it great. Not to tip off any plot spoilers but perhaps the film's message is curiosity may be dangerous. It seems more like a Mystery than a Thriller to me. Perhaps that reclassification would boost its small but growing fanbase.

Sex Scene: Some of those who get the movie understand the psychology of the action between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. The director deliberately stops the sex early between them by switching to a boring post-coital chitchat before thrusting back into the sex harder than before. Many people believe they really had sex to film the scene. The result is a psychological jarring of your mental state. You were expecting one thing to happen but it didn't (good old-fashioned filmmaking). These kind of bait-and-switch moves are used frequently. It's unsettling in a subtle, edgy and raw way you don't see much anymore. Kudos to the filmmakers for having the stones to create a unique horror film. If you understand what is happening to you while you watch it you begin to appreciate the tone the director was deliberately trying to set. The movie itself tries to break the fourth wall by pissing you off, misleading you, boring you, and fooling you until you are gasping for breath before the big finale in lockstep with Sutherland. The movie takes its sweet time winding up before slapping the viewer around in the shocking conclusion. We both want a resolution. Sutherland gets his answer. And this all succeeds remarkably well in upsetting people who don't get it judging by the reviews here! So this horror gem has that going for it. :-)

Final Notes: The film isn't linear and there is the same amount of action as in The Legend of Hell House. It's almost giallo-like in an American way in it's execution. As true horror should, this film does not leave one with a happy feeling that the world is saved. It's ambiguous, uncertain, and does not go the way you think it will. There are also plenty of production stories to fuel interest in this long-lost horror gem. If this sounds interesting, don't read any more reviews which could give away the surprise ending. For mature horror fans, check out Don't Look Now.",1371859200,4,5825,4.65242718446602

Yes, it has surprising turns and wonderful performances. But it is the emotional resonance that all these elements achieve that help distance this movie from so many other dramatic films in the genre. Roeg is a visual poet and he distorts traditional narrative form in ways that magnify the heart of the narrative: this is a film about loss and how people deal with it in their own ways.

In my honest opinion, this is a nearly flawless piece of cinematic work.  The acting is top notch, with the always reliable and visually stunning Julie Christie as co-lead to Donald Sutherland, whose performance here is just short of bravura.

In addition to top-notch acting across the board, DLN is notable for the exceptional quality of its cinematography and editing as well as its amazing use of what might just be the most beautiful city in the world - Venice.  Having just visited there, I can attest to the fact that Roeg and co. nailed the sights, sounds, and vibe of a city that is as mystical as it is ancient and charming.  Also outstanding, the film's score, which was done by then novice Pino Donagio, who would later go on to score Brian DePalma's masterpiece, Carrie.

Last but not least, the script and the dialogue are crisp and adult, depecting what is perhaps the most artful sex scene on celluloid.  Issues of faith, love, and the mysteries of the human spirit are also captured beautifully here.

 Working with elements of the traditional horror genre - second sight, ESP, warnings from the dead, a mad killer - and a cinematography of disquieting beauty and dreamlike sense of dislocation, director Nicolas Roeg weaves a fabric of anxiety that questions all reality.

1218511,4,B00000I1DU,"An architect and his wife are haunted by visions of their dead daughter running through the streets of Venice, while the police chase a murderer that is running loose in the dark canals. DON'T LOOK NOW plays on several major themes, with the most prominent being that ""Nothing is what it seems."" This is constantly replayed in everything from John's restoration work to the thrilling climax . Julie Christie plays opposite of the great Donald Sutherland as the troubled married couple coping with their loss, as the two are faced with the prospect of communicating with their dead daughter through a pair of psychic sisters. The uncertainty of the sisters' motives drives the suspense just as much as the murders in town and the supernatural elements of the plot, since it they are not revealed to be friend nor foe until the closing act. Where the picture will find the most difficulty in attracting new audiences is in its deliberate pacing, which takes great strides in developing the characters and plot but lacks the action or frights of most modern ghost tales. The distinct 70s vibe and methodical delivery will appeal to fans of the similarly structured AUDREY ROSE or LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH, where mood and atmosphere win over gore and violence. DON'T LOOK NOW holds a high standing alongside other Supernatural Suspense Thrillers, and is well worth the wait for the shocking finale.

The uneasy disquiet and imminent doom that pervades the film ""Genova"", as it drags us along labyrthinine alleys in a strange and atmospheric old-world city evoked a ""familiar-unfamiliar"" sensation that unsettled me on the short walk home through my quiet but now slightly menacing neighbourhood.
In a sudden flash it came to me that I was being niggled by distant memories of ""Don't Look Now"", which I saw only once, about forty years ago. Julie Christie, gorgeous and intense, and Donald Sutherland,younger then than Keifer now,are haunted by glimpses and hyper-real apparitions of their 10yo drowned daughter, as they negotiate the steamy canals and mysterious byways of Venice.. Even forty years after first release Dont Look Now retains that powerful sense that something is happening but you don't know what it is do you?...until the very last moment...and then it's too late.

Sutherland didn't have 6-pack abs, but he did look like an attractive man in his unique way; and bless Christie for her natural breasts.

Don't Look Now is a horror movie that draws much of its suspense from its starkly threatening cinematography and a director who manages to consistently convince the audience that something very wrong is about to happen; though the final reveal of who the red-caped figure is seems completely arbitrary and the narrative has its slow moments, this is on the whole a very interesting and novel horror film.

Second, while this movie has a great location (Venice), is very atmospheric, written well, has fine acting and contains great foreshadowing, it kind of falls flat.  It's got all these four-star elements, yet it comes out as a three-star film, which still isn't bad, mind you.

Third, I must confess that I might have biased my review before I even saw the movie.  As I was looking through all the reviews on amazon and IMDB, I kept reading about the ""surprise ending"" and the ""shocking final moments.""  Well, curiousity got the better of me, so I swung on over to YouTube to see what everyone was talking about.  The ending didn't make much sense to me until I watched the movie, but knowing what the ending was probably jaded me to the film's effect.

There's definitely a lot of mystery (and not a little creepiness) building throughout the film, but don't expect that time will fly as you watch.  I wouldn't say the movie plods or that it's boring.  What I would say is that it's deliberately paced.

So, I recommend the film, but don't you go off and ruin the ending for yourself as I did.  Find out the surprise ending by watching the movie.  You might come away more satisfied and impressed with the experience.",1251331200,7,1469,4.518939393939394

This is a very well-made, creepy thriller.

Everyone seems to be a potential threat, every action is suspicious, even if we don't know why.  And the soundtrack adds just the right eerie touch.  Christie is young and beautiful, Sutherland is moody and complex; they have great chemistry together and share a scene that surely should have been rated X.

Italy was a great importer of gialli during the mid-sixties to mid-seventies.  Watching ""Don't Look Now"" reminded me of Aldo Lado's ""Who Saw Her Die?""  Both films have gorgeous Venetian scenery, especially of the canals and bridges that cross them.  Both involve serial killers throwing corpses into these canals.

  ""Don't Look Now"" is rife with supernatural elements.  An architect (Donald Sutherland of ""The Puppet Master"" and ""Virus"") senses his daughter's drowning in his pond; unfortunately, he is too late to save her.  While restoring a church in Venice, he learns a serial killer is throwing his victims into the canal.  He catches brief glimpses of someone, perhaps a child, wearing a red raincoat - the one his daughter was wearing when she drowned.  Soon he is involved in a mysterious accident.  A blind psychic warns him that his daughter wants him and his beautiful wife (Julie Christie of ""Demon Seed"") to leave Venice.  What is the connection between the serial killer and his dead daughter?

  ""Don't Look Now"" is based on a story by Daphne Du Maurier who also wrote the supernatural best seller ""Rebecca,"" which also involved a bizarre haunting.  Gloomy, gothic scenery and a eerie piano score by Pino Donaggio (""Crawlspace"") gives the viewer a sense of impending doom.  The love scene between the married couple was a touching distraction.  Overall, ""Don't Look Now"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy good supernatural horror fare of the seventies such as ""Audrey Rose,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud,"" ""The Omen,"" and ""The Other.""

Actually I did find it more tolerable this time--less scary, but it was awfully long and I lost interest about two thirds of the way through.  The cinematography is gorgous and there's a lot of beauty in the film, lots of shots of the splendid old churches.  It just didn't work for me.  It is supposed to be extremely mysterious, with all of the dark, decaying sumptuousness of old Venice, but there were too many night shots of the dark canals, rats, menacing people looking out of windows, etc. not to mention the poor blind psychic woman and her frumpy sister...It was just too much to take seriously and to keep the suspense up you have to take it somewhat seriously.

Julie Christie is quite beautiful in her prime and the sex scene is very nice.  Personally I don't find Donald Sutherland very attractive,  and the big 70's hairstyle and tight clothes of the era made him look really dorky. It might have worked better with a more appealing actor.

I do like some of Roeg's films a lot and I can appreciate his work here.  If you have a high tolerance for this style you may like this; otherwise you  may either have a laugh or be bored.

1218526,5,B00000I1DU,"Nicholas Roeg's 1973 DON'T LOOK NOW may be one of the single best studio films produced during the great so-called Hollywood Renaissance of 1969-1977; it certainly is one of the most influential. Using Daphne du Maurier's brilliantly ambiguous and mysterious novella as its base, Roeg uses her ghost story to produce what is really a meditation on time and space and the way in which fiction (and particularly film) structure our epistemological awareness of them both. The primary setting is Venice during the off-season, where a wealthy couple, John and Laura Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie), are recuperating from the loss of their small daughter who drowned months before on their English estate. John is working restoring a damaged sixteenth-century venetian church, while Laura is distracted by a mysterious pair of English sisters, one of whom is psychic and insists their dead daughter is trying to contact them to warn them of impending danger.

There's much more besides, and Roeg complicates matters by splintering our awareness of both physical space (by complex camera work that emphasizes reflections and disjuncture) and of time (by crosscutting future events with events taking place in diegetic time). When all this comes together, especially when John conducts a cat-and-mouse game through the labyrinthine venetian streets and alleyways looking for both his wife and for a figure in a red mackintosh that may be his dead daughter, the emphasis on filmic technique begins to go beyond mere academic exercises and to increase your sense of suspense and horror. Certain sequences have become true classics, most particularly the famous sequence of Sutherland and Christie having sex in their Venetian hotel crosscut with scenes of them dressing afterwards; everything is beautifully fractured and splintered. As with De Palma's films from the same period, horror and the uncanny are used as vehicles through which the director can show us how film disrupts all our spatio-temporal coordinates. The acting at times might seem to contemporary viewers over-the-top (particularly in the opening sequence when Sutherland fails to save his daughter from drowning and carries her muddied body into the home), but it wouldn't work if it weren't pitched at this level. Neither Sutherland nor Christie have ever been better than they are here, and they share a terrific rapport.",1214352000,4,2398,5.327176781002638

I find I have to evaluate this film on two levels.  First, there is no movie that projects an atmosphere of palpable dread and uneasiness more successfully.  Every moment seems fraught with mystery and impending doom; we never feel safe in this picture.  It is the payoff to the magnificent build-up where the film falls flat.

1218531,3,B00000I1DU,"Different people go ga-ga over different things, and I seldom enjoy stories or plays or films that have supernatural creatures or events that are meant to be taken seriously. In this film one is expected to believe in psychic abilities (or at least suspend one's disbelief for the duration). While I could not do that in the case of DON'T LOOK NOW, I was able to appreciate the acting and some of the director's clever touches.

Donald Sutherland is excellent throughout, and Julie Christie and the rest of the cast are quite good. From the opening seconds of the film, the color red is linked with the little daughter who drowns, and this color is skillfully brought in repeatedly during the rest of the film, not only with the hooded garment worn by the small person Sutherland follows in Venice, but with many other objects the camera forces us to stare at, including the red part of Sutherland's scarf and some red laundry hanging on clothes lines across the canals. (This was so effectively done that, for more than half a day after watching this film, whenever I saw anything red in my own house or in the neighborhood, I recalled the scene of the little girl drowning--and the scene where Sutherland finally meets up with the mysterious small female near the end of the film.)

The music is appropriate to reinforce the mood of the whole film, and the closing scene on the Grand Canal is a satisfying one, explaining as it does (within the premise of psychic abilities) the huge mistake that Sutherland's character had made concerning his wife and two other women. Further, the film's controversial nude love scene is suddenly and completely ""artistically justified"" by the way parts of it are shown to us again in a poignant context: replaying in Sutherland's mind as he loses consciousness near the end. And finally, as an aid in understanding the plot, watch the actors' credits of the film to see how the small female in Venice is described there; that should help you understand what the director intended us to ""get"" in relation to her.

While Don't Look Now does have horror movie elements it's much more of a drama/thriller with a touch of possible ghostly visions and psychic visions. All the movie really does is simply take horror movie elements, but it's not really a horror flick per se.

Don't Look Now is a very slow-burn horror movie and if you don't have the patience this movie isn't for you. The plot takes a while to really get going and even after that it still doesn't take off right away. The horror aspects are a lot more subtle than what you'll normally find. Don't Look Now isn't scary, but does have a creepy vibe going for it. Despite the slow-burn nature of the movie the plot is actually always there from the start and odds are some of it might be lost on the viewer at first. Some scenes that don't seem like they have anything to do with the plot actually have a lot more than you might think.

The screenplay by Allan Scott & Chris Bryant is terrific; it's very well written with great characters that aren't just paper thin. They have a lot of depth. The movie is very much driven by the characters along with a lot of mystery. It's really after the movie is over is when you realize how well written the movie was with all the subtle hints of what is to come.

Director Nicholas Roeg does a fantastic job at keeping the pace moving as well as giving subtle hints of what is to come. Don't Look Now serves as a great mystery and in scenes meant to entice suspense are excellent and often creepy. The movie is set in Venice and Roeg uses the location to near perfection. Bottom line is you'll be hard pressed to find a better directed movie than Don't Look Now.

The acting is solid, Julie Christie delivers a solid performance and Donald Sutherland is simply brilliant. Even though I have seen plenty of his movies I never realized how many truly great movies he's done and how wonderful of an actor he is. Sutherland is without a doubt one of the most versatile actors you'll come across.

Don't Look Now isn't for everyone I can see how some might find the movie boring, but those who appreciate slow-burn horror flicks that are more subtle rather than in your face odds are you'll really like this one.

John and his wife, Laura, played by Julie Christie, have recently lost a young daughter, who drowned in a pond near their home in England. Because this movie is based on a story by Daphne Du Maurier, the viewer should, I suppose, be prepared to accept the unexpected and unbelievable. In spite of the story's paranormal aspects, it is filmed in a realistic manner, which made it easy for me to buy into the ESP. And, hey, I'm a skeptic. Yet, I like the movie. I guess I have to say that it's creepy, but not too creepy. Moreover, most of the paranormal stuff happens near the end of the film, so I didn't have to cringe throughout the entire thing.",1173312000,,796,4.496551724137931
1218542,3,B00000I1DU,"Boy am I puzzled at the affection this film receives. From most of the other reviews I was expecting something great,  but was instead, greatly disappointed. I found it tedious--lots of shots of people walking, here and there, walking up steps, going door to door with lots of unnecessary details. I kept watching it and reminding myself that this film was made before the George Lucas/MTV revolution which rightly said that editing is a good thing and just because you spent a fortune setting up a shot doesn't mean you have to linger on it and try to get your money's worth.  Cut out the tediousness, please. It only creates boredom and anguish in the viewer. You could easily have cut out a half hour of this film and preferably more. To me, it wasn't much more than a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. I could easily see Rod Serling come out at the end and give one of his classic pithy synopses.

I first found out about this film by hearing about the sex scene and all the hoopla about whether it was real or not. Well, that made me curious, but when I saw all the glowing reviews, it sounded like it was worth watching. Sorry folks, that sex scene was completely unerotic for me, especially with all the disabling cutaways. Give me Omar Shariff and Julie instead anyday, even without the skin. By today's standards this famous sex scene rates an R, but not an R bordering on X at all, more like R bordering on PG-13. And what's it doing there? What's the need for a graphic sex scene? Well, it gets people like me to watch the film. Seemed unnecessary. They could have easily done it with their clothes on and it probably would have been a lot more erotic if they had. Was it real? Was what real?

As for the surprising twist of an ending. Am I psychic? I saw that ending coming a mile away. 90% of horror films will tell you exactly what to expect at that ending.  I was so disappointed. I thought, no, they're not going to say that this is all that this has been about. Yep, they did. No real lasting thoughts about death and life and love. Just plot. And talk about milking the horror. I kept thinking, get it  over with already. And the epiphany? Huh? Weren't we being told that all the way through the film? Weak on horror, not particularly great acting, and some shots which today look campy, especially the ones with the two sisters. Sorry, I don't get what's the big deal.

Anyway, if you liked this film, I'd suggest Peter Weir's film ""The Last Wave."" Both films have the same feeling, deal with similar characters and plot structure, but Weir's film has stronger moments of horror (also without gore--actually less gore than this one), a richer, more compelling ""parallel universe,"" and some loose ends to ponder.",1172188800,3,2721,4.495951417004049

Not because it's an average movie, but because it had to settle in and nag at me for a while. I kept thinking about it's many subtle hints and portents. I kept seeing different scenes in my head. Yep, I was haunted by this movie! It came to the point where I simply had to watch it again. I now consider DLN a dark and brooding masterpiece of horror and supernatural dread. Both Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are perfect in their roles as shell-shocked parents, forced to face both the realities of death and the possibility of what lies beyond it. I highly recommend this movie. If you don't love it the first go round, wait a while and see if it doesn't grow on you...",1167868800,11,807,4.386666666666667
1218544,5,B00000I1DU,"Nicolas Roeg proved he was a filmmaking genius in 1971 with Walkabout.

In 1973, he released Don't Look Now, a horror film, that isn't watched by many today but in my mind cements his status as a brilliant filmmaker. Don't Look Now is not a typical horror film. It works with dread, not with fright. It is a series of images that lead up to the final shocking climax, much like Rosemary's Baby. The difference between this film and that film is this movie has a lot more unsettling images leading to the climax. In fact, this movie's all about unsettling images and its opening sequence establishes that quickly. The movie's opening sequence truly ranks up there with one of the best. The movie opens, sometime in autumn, in the British countryside home of John and Laura Baxter (Donald Sutherland & Julie Christie). Inside, they're working. John is studying slides of Venetian churches. In the slide he's studying there appears to be a figure wearing a shiny red raincoat. Outside, their children play. Their son is riding his bike, their daughter Christine, wearing a shiny plastic raincoat, plays by a pond. Christine throws her ball into the bond, her brother runs over a pane of glass, inside John looks up as if sensing the sound. He spills a glass, a red stain appears on the slide. It looks like blood. The next shot shows Christine lying face down in the pond. John gets up, runs outside, wades across the pond, and grabs his daughters' body with a cry of grief. This, of course, sets up the plot of the entire movie as well as the visual theme of the movie. In the next scene, John and Laura are in Venice while John restores an old church. Their son is at a school back in Britain. While at a restaurant, Laura meets two old women named Heather (Hilary Mason) and Wendy (Clelia Matania). Heather's blind and, Wendy claims, psychic. Pretty soon, Heather tells Laura that she has seen Christine laughing and that she's happy. Laura is shocked and, returning to the table where her husband is, she passes out. When she awakes at the hospital, she finds herself believing the women, and her and John go back to the house for a graphic sex scene. That's not accurate; it is graphic, but also realistic and passionate. Intercut with scene of John and Laura dressing afterward. As the plot progresses, John begins to see a figure wearing a shiny red raincoat running around Venice. John is a man who doesn't believe in omens or ghosts or the afterlife. Even though his wife is happy about what Heather has told her, and he lets her have her happiness, he sees it as a bunch of mumbo jumbo. In one scene, Heather tells Laura that it's John who has second sight. ""He has the gift, even if he doesn't know it, even if he's resisting it."" I've left out several key parts in the plot, because I might inadvertently give you an idea of what happens by explaining them. But the movie has a great, haunting, twist ending that I'm surprised doesn't get more attention. Sure, you realize what's going to happen a few moments before it does...But it's still very well done. Roeg and his editor took a risk by placing one key-scene in the film that could've ruined this ending. The scene is when Laura has gone back to Britain, because their son has had a minor accident. As John travels across the Grand Canal, he sees his wife and the two sisters pass him. How could this be? Is it a mistake? A fantasy? This scene is one of the most haunting scenes in the movie, but it won't click with most people until the end...And yes, it didn't click with me either. Don't Look Now is a masterpiece of horror, whether it's the kind of horror you enjoy or not. It's got great performances, directorial brilliance, and great cinematography. In other words, see it.

The film features the scenery of the ever exotic Venice, Italy (a natural match for cinematographer Roeg), as well as some strong performances by Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland. Although the film is very well made and never boring, what keeps me from enjoying it more is a distance from the central characters. We seemingly get to know them in an intimate way, including sexually. However, everything that happens is remotely, without their thoughts or any sort of narrative voice being revealed to draw us closer to them. Perhaps this is a device that is employed intentionally in order to make us feel the desperation the daughter feels at not being able to talk with them. Whatever the intent, it makes for a slightly off-kilter feel. I wouldn't really call this a horror film, but I find the conclusion nonetheless rewarding and it is always great to see supernatural elements included in a first-rate film.",1164585600,4,1581,4.833948339483395

Sutherland's performance - if I didn't know it was Donald Sutherland - I would say this guy is the worst actor I have ever seen.  Julie Christie and the supporting, mostly Italian actors, give realistic performances that draw one into the story.

The story is about a couple in their forties who lose a young daughter in a tragic drowning accident on the property of their English country house.  The couple goes to Venice where the husband John (Sutherland) works to restore old churches.  His wife Laura meets two VERY creepy elderly Englishwomen, sisters, one of which is blind.  The blind one cheerfully proclaims she has ""seen"" their deceased daughter Christine.  Laura is overwhelmed with emotion and collapses.  Thus begins the strange spiral of events leading ultimately to a satisfying conclusion.

I don't recall ever being so bored in a ""horror"" film.  Mind you, I don't judge how good a horror movie is by either the special effects, the gore or the number of times I'm jolted out of my seat.  I certainly appreciate subtle terror flicks, such as Rosemary's Baby, Burnt Offerings, The Haunting (original version), Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte, etc. The look of the film is great; Venice never looked more appealing yet ominous.  Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are first rate actors, so no qualms in that department.  The film's artsy tendencies are sometimes effective, but more often than not, distracting. The sisters were a bit creepy but that's about it.  I almost lost it in the scene where the blind, psychic sister slips into a trance and starts groping at what looked like to me, her breast.  It's just not a movie that, despite its pedigree and reputation, engenders much from the viewer, other than a sense of mind boggling tedium.

This one stays with you, and all of the participants are crucial to the film's effect, so it's not just the artful photography and editing. The beautiful Julie Christie, always a bit mysterious, has an amazing sex scene with Donald Sutherland (they play a husband and wife in this film), that is intercut with shots of the two getting dressed afterward.  Erotica, not pornography, although it treads a thin line. Inspired from start to finish, Sutherland's slow motion fall from a scaffold is foreshadowed earlier by Christie's slow motion blackout at a restaurant table.  There are many moments of cinemagraphic brilliance throughout, and Roeg's triumph here is how he manages to take a rather simple story and make it seem more complex and deep than it really is. Because the film is so visually stimulating, the shocking ending is not critical to its success; in other words, knowing what's going to happen doesn't matter, as it would if the rest of the movie weren't so stunning.

Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are parents who's only daughter recently drowned.  He is working on restoring a church in Venice.  She starts to have visions of her daughter.

She becomes obsessed with her visions of the little girl in the rain coat to the extent that her husband begins to worry about her.  When she meets two sisters, one with ESP, things escalate and she continues to lose her grasp on reality.

Works quite well until the 'shock' ending when all is revealed - yes folks, just a z grade gorefest after all (strange, the daughter and the dwarf both wear a red cloak, and are the same height, how eerie). The film carefully builds up an air of supernatural tension through wonderful photography of Venice - rarely has it seemed so disquieting - and the realisation of Baxter (Sutherland) that he may have the ability to contact another reality where his drowned daughter is still living. But you can't have it both ways: it's either a supernatural thriller or it's a shocker, and the inclusion of a gruesome death scene at the end reveals that all that has gone before has been a delusion: beautifully photographed and brilliantly acted nonsense. Same fool-the-audience technique used in Basic Instinct, both films revealing, for the sake of a shock ending, that the body of the film has been spurious.

The acting by the two main charachters is good , no doubt, however, the acting by the other actors and actresses in this movie is a joke.  They are so rediculously over the top with their expressions that it's hard to take them seriously. The story lacks any real horror to it. Through out the flick, the two main charachters brood over the loss of their child and have numerous visits with a a set of sisters, one being blind and psychic. The movie tries desperately to be mysterious and scary by making these sisters seem to be creepy. However, the scenes between them and the convulsions that the blind sister goes through, are just plain laughable.  The thing many fans of this film seem to harbor on is the ending . To me the ending was a total let down. We are able to see the villian of the movie for about a whole 1 minute- not very scary at all.  I would definetly not recommend this film to any serious horror fan. It just isn't scary, and it's an outright snooze fest. 1 star for this piece of trash.",1125100800,9,1280,4.334728033472803
1218553,3,B00000I1DU,"I bought this movie because a recent television program rated it as one of the 100 scariest movies of all time.  Now, I can't say that I agree with that.  It certainly is one of the most stylized horror movies of all time.  The problem is that it is TOO stylized; I found that the style kept getting in the way of the story.

Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a married couple who have recently lost a daughter.  Sutherland shows signs of ESP but refuses to believe it.  They go to Venice where he is restoring a church and meet a couple of weird sisters (in the Shakespearian sense) who can ""see"" the little girl's spirit and make dire predictions about the husband.  Meanwhile, there is a series of gruesome murders happening and Sutherland keeps seeing a figure in a red raincoat who could be the ghost of his daughter.

This is an incredibly slowly-paced movie.  I kept asking myself, ""What is the point of this shot?""  A lot of the shots are there just to be there.  The director keeps the audience at arm's length, so we never really become that involved with the characters.  He is in love with montage editing and flash-backs - and flash-forwards - which don't always work.  The end of the movie I found especially disappointing.  It had kind of been given away to me, so I knew what to expect, but I wanted more of an explanation.  I thought the characters would all tie-in together somehow, but they don't - leaving the audience to say, ""That's it?""  That's it.",1118016000,9,1479,4.48314606741573
1218554,3,B00000I1DU,"""Don't Look Now"" is one hell of a headtrip, and as such it deserves perhaps more than one viewing.  There is a way that this all ties together, although I wouldn't venture to say precisely how.

In a pretty overblown scene at the beginning, Donald Sutherland gives one of the most amazing, digitally enhanced Chewbacca screams ever to pierce the ears of weird cinema buffs as his daughter drowns in a really odd accident outside their home.  (If anyone recalls the end of the 70's remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", they'll know precisely what I'm talking about).

From there things get seriously dissociated and, at times, frightening.  The scene that stands out most in my mind is Julie Christie encountering the cataract psychic in the bathroom.  The problem is that every scene of this film is a little too momentous to be significant. Events are triggering events within the intricacies of events; tables fall, people scream, hysteria takes over more than once, but at no point do we have that weird thread of understanding that happens during the most symbolic, cryptic film.  In this sense the film is a failure.

Donald Sutherland's character stands out the most sharply, and he does the best acting.  He is a decent guy who is understandably trying to forget about his daughter's death because in his mind, it was his fault.  He apparently has ""second sight"", although this isn't elaborated too much by the homeless looking old psychic with the strange eyes.

The ending is seriously frightening.  There's no rational resolution or anything you can take from the last scene, with what looks like his daughter in a red raincoat, only withered, old and evil.  For that moment and that moment only the film becomes terrifying.

All in all, though, this isn't a must see.  It is worth a watch for those who get a rush from symbolic cinema, or the really subtle, but don't expect anything close to an ""answer"".  That wouldn't be a problem normally with these kind of films; but it promises one.",1112832000,7,2007,4.790697674418604
1218555,3,B00000I1DU,"Don't Look Now is a strange motion picture, drenched in symbolism, and with a labyrinthine plot that keeps the audience's minds spinning and wondering what the meaning of all of its odd shots is. Well eventually it all does come together, but, well, maybe one viewing isn't enough to soak it all in, because I was left wondering if there was something I missed.

The film opens with the death of the daughter of John and Laura Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie), in a sequence with some brilliant film editing, as it cuts between the girl playing outside and the parents inside, and we get the idea that maybe John is having a premonition of this tragedy. This sets the tone for the rest of the film.

The Baxters, now living in Venice, meet a pair of sisters, Wendy (Clelia Matania) and Heather (Hilary Mason), who is a blind psychic. Heather warns Laura to leave Venice and says that something terrible is going to happen to John if they don't leave. She also claims to have seen their dead daughter Christine and that she is happy. Laura believes Heather, but John is skeptical and refuses to leave Venice. He thinks he keeps seeing Christine running through the streets of Venice in the same red raincoat she was wearing when she drowned. But that couldn't be. Or could it?

I found Don't Look Now to be dreadfully boring in some stretches and other parts were pretty incomprehensible. There were also some very compelling sequences, and the film comes to a climax that is almost able to redeem the whole picture. As I stated before, there is a ton of symbolism here, with the color red and water playing a large part in tying various pieces of the movie together. There is also a great deal of religious imagery. But it almost feels like there is just too much symbolism and not enough reality. Sometimes it seems like there are symbols of symbols being flashed on the screen.

Maybe Don't Look Now bears repeat viewings to fully capture its essence, but I'm not at a point in my movie-watching life where I want to take that kind of time to have to study a film to enjoy it.

Not Lost Highway bizarre, everything is played out pretty straightforward with no nightmarish claptrap, yet it still manages to make you scratch your head.

1218561,5,B00000I1DU,"""Don't Look Now"" appeared out of nowhere to revitalize the suspense genre. Despite the supernatural elements, this isn't a horror movie but a thriller like the type Hitchcock might have made if he had incorporated supernatural elements into his films during their prime. A film about loss (both loss of life, sanity, spouse and child)and an obsessive desire to find perhaps try and reclaim what's gone, ""Don't Look Now"" uses what would have been considered a stylized approach to thrillers (again, not unlike Hitchcock in his prime which is appropriate given that Allan Scott and Chris Bryant based their creepy screenplay on a Daphne Du Maurier story. Du Maurier wrote three stories that Hitchcock based film upon). While elements of it seem almost conventional visually it's still quite stunning and unique.

""Don't Look Now"" begins with a tranquil moment at the Baxter home. John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) is examining slides of a church he's renovating in Venice). His wife Laura(the beautiful and talented Julie Christie) is reading. Their two children a boy and a girl wearing a red hooded raincoat are playing outside after a recent rain storm. While examining one of the slides John notices a red hooded figure in one of the shots of the church. He doesn't recall seeing it when he took the original pictures and it isn't in the next. He spills water on the slide. The red dye from the hood spreads across the slide like blood. Suddenly, John has a premonition; his daughter is in danger. He runs out only to discover she's drowned.

Some time has passed and while John and Laura are in Venice for the restoration, they meet a pair of sisters (Hilary Mason and Clelia Matania) one of whom claims to be psychic (she's also blind). The psychic sister claims to have seen the ghost of the Baxter's little girl. What are their motives are they here to help? His Laura spirals into what could be madness, John becomes obsessed with finding the red hooded figure from his slide as it turns up in the psychic's vision. There's also a mysterious murderer working the streets of Venice which figures into the plot as well.

Roeg's dreamlike pacing, use of colors and imaginery makes ""Don't Look Now"" an atmospheric marvel and the type of suspense film that builds from the inside out; that is most of the suspense comes from the characters and lanquid pacing not from rapid fire cutting and gore. It's subtle and, if you're expecting something like the film ""Scream"" (which is quite a good film although very different stylistically), you'll be bored and disappointed.

Sadly, the Paramount DVD has no extras except for the trailer, no commentary but it is an anamorphic transfer of the film and it does positively splendid with the rich colors of the original theatrical print well preserved. It's a pity that Roeg wasn't asked to do a commentary track (nor Sutherland or Christie two terrific actors that are in their prime here). It's a pity. Perhaps Criterion will license this and add the extras that we've come to expect for many of these classic suspense thrillers.

For a really creepy evening, ""Don't Look Now"" with its disquieting images, dream like pacing and startling ending will do perfectly. The print and transfer look marvelous and the soundtrack (although in mono and not remixed for stereo), sounds good as well.

Since then, Nicolas Roeg's film version of Daphne du Maurier's short story has become a ""classic"" for some critics and cinema buffs.  Now, after 30 years, I've viewed this movie again and feel it's a marvelously atmospheric, well directed and well acted movie, but it left me feeling oddly empty.  The pace is so slow at times, you have to wonder where the movie is going.  Is Julie Christie really imagining things; what is the extent of the psychic sister's visions?  Is Sutherland really psychic too; what about the Bishop?  Doesn't he awaken in the night on the fateful night's climactic scene?  Does Sutherland really think perehaps this red-cloaked figure could be his dead daughter?  How can this little dwarf manage to kill so many people and never get caught?

With vibrant imagery(Sutherland's near death from the scaffolding; the end's violent yet poetic ending; and the marvelous score from Pino Donaggio (Carrie, Body Double), one would have expected a more sense of resolution, which sadly this film doesn't have.

1218566,1,B00000I1DU,"""Don't Look Now"" is a favourite of mine in every sense of the word. I really was looking forward to watching the Australian R4 DVD with much eagerness. Sadly, the soundtrack was so appallingly awful I had no recourse but to return it to the online store where'd I'd bought it. In critising the DVD, I'm hoping the R1 has better sound than the Australian version because the DVD would have to be the greatest disappointments I've ever bought.

Hopefully, sometime, they might release a better version DVD into the Australian market with a decent soundtrack.

You don't notice it while watching, but your emotions slowly build -- empathy, curiousity, passion, fear -- until the very end, when all of those emotions 'burst' into all-over-the-body chills and for me, tears of sadness, empathy and disappointment (not in the plot of course ...

1218569,5,B00000I1DU,"This film certainly rises above the genre of horrow movies and remains a classic after 30 years. Based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, the movie is set for the most part in Venice, the most mysterious of cities that is so conducive to horror, suspense and intrigue. (DEATH IN VENICE, THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY are just three other movies set in Venice that have some of the same eerie feel to them as this one does.)Two of the reasons for the success of this movie are Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, two of my favorite actors. I didn't remember Sutherland having that much hair if it's his; also, I never thought Julie Christie resembled Michael York before. (Someone should  play with a computer and juxtapose their portraits, one over the other. The likeness would be striking.)
Sutherland and Christie have just lost a daughter by drowning. While in Venice they meet spinster sisters, one who is blind, who tells the grieving Christie that she has ""seen"" her daughter. The plot gets scarier by the minute. There is a wonderful sense of forboding that builds into a horrific climax. The film is beautifully shot with images-- blood, water, Christie and the two sisters riding in a water taxi-- repeated.
The sex scene between Christie and Sutherland has to be one of the most erotic ever shot and remains so after 30 years. The director intersperses their sex romp with scenes of their getting dressed to leave their hotel, a great touch.
Certainly the movie is not as frightening the second time around since we know the outcome; that is certainly not a criticism, however.

Chilling is certainly not a word I would use, unless you count the way they try to make Donald Sutherland into a sex symbol (eeeeww).  What's sad about the whole thing is that you've got all the elements for a great suspense/horror film - a dead child, psychic abilities, strange ocurrences, unexplained accidents - but they never gel into a cohesive plot, nor do they frighten you or cause you to feel any suspense.  Even at it's low price, I'd give this one a pass if I were you and check out a real example of 70's suspense/horror, such as the Tenant or Coma.

1218572,4,B00000I1DU,"Don't Look Now (1974) certainly has a number of elements to draw in the hardened horror fan, i.e. a creepy old blind woman with ESP, vague and not so vague warnings from beyond the grave, a serial killer, but there may be surprises and even disappointment to those same fans as the film comes to an ambiguous close.
Starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie as married couple John and Laura Baxter, director Nicolas Roeg takes the viewer on a surrealistic ride, one that certainly is open to many interpretations.  The Baxter's, recently suffering the loss of their daughter are now in Venice, when John, as an architect, is working on the renovation of an old church.  Laura, still trying to come to terms with the death of their daughter, finds acceptance to come from a rather strange source, that of an elderly blind woman and her sister, the blind woman having the gift of second sight.  Also, she reveals John may be of a similar nature in having abilities he hasn't recognized or acknowledged.  John thinks it a lot of flibberty jibberty, and thinks his wife may be still suffering over their loss.
After a more intimate meeting with Laura and the two sisters, strange things begin to occur, and a spate of murders begins to plague the quiet canals of Venice.  Is there a connection?  What is the link between John and Laura, their recently deceased daughter, a sinister serial killer, and these two elder sisters, one with odd abilities?  These questions are all answered by the end of the film, but not in as direct fashion as the casual viewer may like.  Close attention and deep thought are required for thorough enjoyment to be had, as the answers are not necessarily presented in convenient, easily understandable pieces.  I suspect many may be frustrated throughout the film, especially at the end, as I was, but allowing the events to roll around in my head, to soak in, I came to my own conclusions, whether they be sensical ones or not.
I enjoyed this film a lot, and really liked the lovely views of Venice as the movie unfolded.  It provided an excellent backdrop to the story, with amazing cinematography that really highlights sinister elements of darkened alleys, murky water, and the sometimes oppressive feel of a city doomed to a slow death by submersion.  The one thing that was kind of odd was the extended love scene between Sutherland and Christie.  It was done well, but it seemed to go on for quite a bit longer than necessary, in my opinion.  I'm no prude, but I feel I've seen quite enough of Donald Sutherland's backside to last me for a long time.  I had read that this scene was actually a last minute addition, to counteract the scenes where the two characters are in conflict.
Presented here is a beautiful wide screen picture.  A trailer for the film is included, but that is it for special features, unless you count subtitles.  As I stated before, there is a lot of ambiguity within this movie, and sometimes that tends to work against a film, but not so here.  If answers are still not forthcoming, than maybe reading the short story the film is based on, by Daphne du Maurier is in order.

1218573,5,B00000I1DU,"DON'T LOOK NOW is a film for people with a particular taste, and the unwary viewer will either be pleasantly or unpleasantly shocked. From a seemingly simple premise -- a couple trying to overcome their daughter's death, and the odd psychic they meet while staying in Venice -- director Nicholas Roeg creates a thriller/horror movie/dazzling puzzles that slowly infects your mind and then shocks you with its bizarre twists.
Be warned: this isn't a movie for everyone. It relies on visual puzzles and clues and an incredible lot of misdirection for its effect. This might bore some people; it had me riveted with the first scene and held me up through the mind-bending conclusion. Like THE SIXTH SENSE, SLEUTH, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and THE OTHERS, the film is playing a massive deception on the audience and the characters, engaing in a strange game that pays off in an incredibly satisfying (if devastating) way. Every time you think you know what kind of story you're watching, the movie starts veering in another direction, and only the finale finally makes the purpose of the plot clear.
Director Roeg, a former cinematographer, crafts an eerie vision of Venice as damp, mouldy, and crumbling, and his visual compositions have a startling quality that adds to the bizarre and alienated moodof the film. Although few movies have directly copied the story of DON'T LOOK NOW, its directorial style has become the standard for such filmmakers as David Lynch, M. Night Shyamalan, and David Fincher.
This is a landmark piece of work and worth viewing if you enjoy films full of mystery and intelligence (for example, the movies I listed above) and unusual visual style.",1075248000,149,1666,4.974910394265233
1218574,4,B00000I1DU,"'Don't Look Now' starts wonderfully well; there's something there right in the beginning that's genuinely disturbing: the young girl in red playing about the pool's edges, her reflection upside down in the water. That sequence set the tone, and I made sure to keep watching the film to the end.
Then there's Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland (there's a long love-scene involving these two, nicely portrayed by the way, as far as I can/may judge), and a fine set of secondary characters. Now, personally, I'm interested in the supernatural; so Don't Look Now was worth watching for me, to begin with. It could be somewhat slow and vague for certain people, but if you're drawn to more subtlety than to what (generally) floods the market at this moment, you won't regret any time spent in this film.
And indeed, besides the subject of this review, 1973 also unleashed 'The Exorcist' (as many know, a classic of the macabre). The Exorcist might have overshadowed Don't Look Now (I think I'm allowed to remove 'might have'). Alas, DLN deserves more attention, and I hope it'll get just that.",1073001600,3,1090,4.865591397849462
1218575,4,B00000I1DU,"From my earliest involvement with horror films, or at least when I began learning about different directors and different approaches to the genre, I kept hearing great things about Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a 1974 adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's story of the same name. ""You just have to see this film,"" gushed many of my associates. When questioned further about plot, acting, and the like, all of them without exception just reiterated that it is a great, creepy yarn every horror fan should watch at least once. Since I couldn't find the film on VHS--this was before the proliferation of DVD--I briefly toyed with the idea of reading the book. Amazingly, I couldn't find a copy of du Maurier's story. I completely forgot about ""Don't Look Now"" until I stumbled over it recently during a DVD excursion. Hearing those accolades echoing in my head, I picked up a copy and headed home with high expectations. After watching the movie, I have to say that it was an extremely rewarding experience as well as a confusing one. Roeg's shocker doesn't lend itself easily to the sort of superficial viewing one indulges in when watching a typical horror film. Instead, this movie is a cerebral jaunt through the eerie worlds of psychic abilities, murder, and grief. Don't go into this one expecting a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel.
John and Laura Baxter (played by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, respectively) suffer an immense tragedy when their young daughter drowns in a pond at their house in England. The couple is obviously devastated by this incident, and in an effort to move beyond their grief John accepts a job in Italy refurbishing an ancient church. After leaving their other child in school in England, the Baxters move to the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere of watery Venice. Things turn towards the bizarre very quickly upon their arrival: Laura suffers some sort of fainting fit in a restaurant resulting in a meeting with two extremely odd sisters who profess to have psychic powers. The two spinsters, one of whom is blind, take an immediate interest in John, perhaps recognizing in him some of the same supernatural abilities that they claim to possess. John scoffs at these claims even as he recognizes that his wife comes to revere the two because the women claim knowledge about their deceased daughter. As if this isn't odd enough, murder victims start turning up in the city canals, John nearly dies in an accident at the church, and a miniscule figure clad in the same attire their daughter wore when she died keeps popping up in the streets. When John starts seeing things that have no logical explanation, and as the two sister's pronouncements about an imminent danger become shriller, ""Don't Look Now"" assumes an even creepier mood.
What does it all mean? I don't know, but Roeg's film sure has plenty of great camera work, good performances from its two leads, and a conclusion that is sure to shock the viewer in a way few movies can. Due to the glacial pace of most of the film and the confusing plot threads, I started to pay attention to some of the great scenes. The accident in the cathedral was wonderfully filmed, as were some of the unusual sightings John witnesses towards the end of the film. Of course, you don't know what they mean while you are watching them--you have to wait until the end to put those particular jigsaw pieces into their proper position--but they still convey an unshakable sense that something really wrong is going on. The nightmares unfold against the dreary backdrop of Venice, a town that tourists regularly crow about but a place that appears here as the height of sinister deeds. Buildings stand like mountains of despair, corpses fill the waterways, and the narrow alleyways often remind the Baxters of the daughter they lost whenever they see that little figure in the red coat running about. And that conclusion! Well, try and avoid reading about it in reviews until you see the movie lest you lose the chilling effect.
Much has been made about the love scene between Sutherland and Christie. All I can say about this is that it is more and less than what people say about it. Roeg artfully and tastefully captures on film what was probably a quite explicit scene for the time. I cannot say I am all that impressed with seeing this much of Donald Sutherland. Watching him reach for a cabinet in ""Animal House"" wearing only a sweater did much to scar my young mind, so witnessing even more of Donald here induced nightmares for some time afterwards. As for Julie Christie, I can state with all my heart that she really needed to put on a few pounds. Some like to engage in a debate about ""did they or didn't they?"" with this scene, an argument that is completely useless and probably moot since Sutherland later claimed he was ill with a major cold when they shot the sequence. I did like how Roeg contrasted the couple's passion with rather mundane shots of the two getting ready to go out for dinner.
Regrettably, the DVD only comes with a trailer. Fans of this greatly admired film would surely appreciate a commentary from Roeg, Sutherland, and Christie. You would think getting the three together to talk about the film wouldn't present any difficulties, but such is the way of DVD. Overall, ""Don't Look Now"" succeeds wildly in creating bleak atmosphere, a few intriguing scenes, and a grand conclusion. The molasses-like pacing and confusing plot will probably put many off, especially in this day of rapid fire editing and gory special effects. The movie remains an oddity appreciated by film buffs but neglected by the masses.",1072310400,9,5617,4.803719008264463
1218582,5,B00000I1DU,"Dont look now is a very important film because it changed the way films would be edited forever. There are several key sequences where the editing is beautifully mastered to create wonderful montages not seen since Tarkovsky - the initial child drowning accident, the love making scene shot in reverse and the shock ending. This is a wholly creative film from start to finish. The director has paid remarkable attention to the direction of colors. If you think that Spielberg was original with his girl in the red coat, then you are mistaken. This is where that vision began. The majority of the film takes place in Venice but the director has chosen to roam the more obscure and backward waterways and tunnels. The film is layered with such beautiful simplicity that is should be the goal of every film student to study this material to no end.
The premise basically revolves around a personal family tragedy of a young couple, John and Laura Baxters, played by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, (a magnificent match) who are trying to come to terms with the death of their daughter. Laura finds a blind clairvoyant and her sister by accident in a restaurant who claim that the dead daughter is trying to warn them of some great danger. Slowly Laura starts to crackup as John becomes increasingly angered by her belief in an supernatural afterlife and the warnings given by the medium. The ending manages to shock every time.
This film is not for everybody. The production values are minimal and most of the film was shot from the hip on a shoe-string budget. However the realism that this film conjures up is steaks and bounds ahead of most psychological horror films of its kind. The story is somewhat slow, but emotionally it packs a hell of punch. There are several background elements to the film including a bizarre series of multiple murders, missing persons and events back in England that seem almost connected to the couples genuinely heartfelt struggle to come to terms with bereavement. Essentially this film is every parents nightmare come true and the horror of the loss of a child is very strongly presented and does disturb.
This is a bleak, raw and alarming art house film with many moments that will cause the viewer some distress. The connection between the onlooker and the leading protagonists has an impact that will leave you reeling emotionally long after the film has ended.
A classic masterpiece of emotional and psychological horror.",1069200000,7,2465,4.85748218527316
1218583,4,B00000I1DU,"We've all seen it before: the 'horror' movie where someone's lost a loved one, suddenly their ghost starts popping up, and the desperate search to get to the bottom of it ensues. Director Nicholas Roeg took a story somewhat like that, based on a short story by Rebecca author Daphne DuMaurier, and successfully proved that it doesn't always have to be like that. Don't Look Now is a nearly-forgotten film from the 70's by a nearly-forgotten director (I believe this is the only one of his handful of great films that's on DVD), and after watching the film, I realize it's a shame.
  As Don't Look Now opens, we see a placid little pond, and disjointed, dreamy editing and cinematography that combine to form an unsettling scene of two kids playing. A young boy is riding around on his bike, and a little girl in a red mackintosh is frolicking around. We then see the parents of the children, John and Laura Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie), sitting comfortably inside by the fire. Something is wrong, though. The film's editing style eerily merges the slowly mouting events outside with the warmth of the interior. The boy's bike hits some glass and John's drink crashes on the table. Before we know it, the Baxter's daughter has plunged into the pond and the Baxters are left with a dead daughter.
  Fast-forward to some unknown time in the near future, and the Baxters are in Venice, where John is restoring a church that he quite quickly discovers is an architectural fraud. One day in a restaurant, Laura is encounted by a mysterious, psychic, blind woman who assures her that her daughter is 'happy.' Laura tells her husband this, but John is a staunch non-believer in things of the sort, and in a tender, wonderfully-edited scene, the Baxters make love.
  The love scene in Don't Look Now is notorious for those familiar with it. Being quite graphic, it was trimmed a bit for an R rating in the US, but even by today's standards, it's quite surprising. There's a catch, though - Roeg's film intercuts their frenzied sex with a scene of them dressing afterwards and leaving for dinner (most notably paid tribute to in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight, much tamer, but edited in a similar fashion). Why? It is at once the most frustrating, and greatest, thing about Don't Look Now.
  The film contains a numerous amount of plot strands: a mysterious figure in a red coat (who may or may not be the ghost of the Baxter's daughter) begins to appear around Venice, dead bodies are being found in the canals, the killer's on the loose, and the blind prophet continually warns of John's pending danger. What connects them all? Well, one can't really be sure until the end of the film, and that's where Don't Look Now nearly stumbles.
  In Roger Ebert's review of the film, he comments on how successfully the movie builds up tension and how disappointing the film's climax is, but I felt the opposite. Not that much happens in the movie until its final, bloody, climax. What is important, though, is that every little thing that happens in the film has something to do, in some creepy, abstract way with the film's finale. I found myself immensely frustrated by the middle stretch of the movie, because not much makes sense for a while. Don't worry, though, because director Roeg doesn't offer some neat tie-up of all the loose ends of the film; he simply offers a suggestion to the viewer. The question is: is the suggestion he offers good enough to redeem the complete puzzle that the movie is before it? I'm going to go with 'yes,' for the film doesn't ground itself firmly in reality, thereby allowing some slack in how lucid the ending must be. In fact, it seems somewhat like a dream the whole way through (don't worry, I don't think it is).
  What is the point of Don't Look Now, and why should you watch it? Well, Don't Look Now proves that there may be more 'future' in our present than we think... All of the plot strands seem to occur at odd, disjointed times in the film, and it's up to us to decide what's important. Yes, we do find out who the killer is, but don't expect some easy resolution in the perplexing amalgam that the film is. In fact, Roeg lets two plot strands of the movie converge in its conclusion. I was immensely impressed by Don't Look Now, for the device of 'who's the killer' is actually put to some interesting use. I think I know what the movie suggests, but there's so much there that it requires a second viewing.  If not a second, you should at least give it one, but be prepared to be confused .",1068595200,13,4547,4.584975369458128
1218584,5,B00000I1DU,"Don't Look Now is first and foremost a director's film. And not any director,  but one of the few original, talented and visionary filmmakers who have made a lasting mark on British Cinema to this day, with a cinematic language that benefited greatly from the freedom many directors had before the age of agents,and studio executives took over.
Ken Russell, Derek Jarman, Ken Loach, Robin Hardy, the late Lindsay Anderson, and Nic Roeg, directors whose style and experimentations was not to everyone's liking at the time, but certainly much appreciated later as classics of cinema.
Whether a political statement,a musical biography or a horror story,these directors made films that are different, original and daring, both in their subject and style.
Don't Look Now, Nic Roeg adaptation of Daphne De Maurier's ghost story was one example of this creativity unfolding.
His third film, after the experimental Performance and the masterpiece Walkabout, Don't Look Now invited the wrong type of controversy at the time,the famous,or should I say infamous sex scene between Sutherland and Christie. Did they or didn't they? a question that preoccupied many, and imprinted itself on the film to this day, but on that scene later...
Grieving parents escape to Venice to rebuild their lives after the drowning of their small daughter, on the premise of a church restoration job. Life seems to take a slow but assured return to normality, helped by the change both parents sorely needed, when a blind and creepy clairvoyant/psychic (with her sister) drops a chilling bomb on still emotionally very vulnerable mother: I have 'seen' your daughter sitting next to you and she was happy!.
This is when everything steadily changes..not only for the parents whose world slowly collapses around them,but for the viewer as well. The blind psychic has another surprise up her sleeve, one that will turn hope into a chilling warning: Your daughter has warned me,the father is in danger and he must leave Venice at once!
Venice that magical Italian city, turn from a beautiful romantic place that helps couples rebuild their lives, to one with its maze like dark alleys and lanes that is sinister and uninviting. This is the genuis of Roeg in visually showing this slow change, while keeping the both dreamy and eerie mood constant from the first scene until the twist at the end.
So the sex scene, which is one of the best ever filmed, can be see as a passion reignited between a couple who has been through a lot. It is  a sort of sexual affirmation of their slow return to normality ..this is why it is so believable and natural and never gratitious or voyeuristic.
Roeg, as he himself admitted in the making of documentary, could not have chosen a better cast than Sutherland and Christie. He had only these two fine actors in mind for his film, Sutherland at the peak of his career, an actor with whom great directors like Fellini and Bertolucci had had great faith in, and Julie Christie , in my opinion a very much underrated actress with a classic beauty and classy personality.
I will not spoil the ending for those who have no seen it, save to say, Don't Look Now while can not be pigeonholed into a specific genre, be it horror or thriller, it is rather a film that manages to capture your senses from the first scene and take you on a journey that is full of grief, passion, guilt, false hopes, sinister secret, and a city that can be both welcoming and deadly..
Films like these are rarely made these days, until of course studio executives give back the total artistic freedom to talented directors to do what they know best, and forget the debacle of Heaven's Gate which was responsible for stifling many talents in cinema.

1218586,4,B00000I1DU,"Firstly, 'Don't Look Now' is not a horror film, so if you're in the market for scares and thrills, then steer clear of it. However, it is one of the most affecting and melancholic films of the early 1970's, on a par with 'The Exorcist' for atmosphere and suspense.
Director Nicholas Roeg's interpretation of a tortured couple (played exquisitely by Julie Christie and Donald 'Buffy' Sutherland) stuck in Venice, to escape the memories of their dead child is central to the creation of this tension. Peter Katz's excellent production beautifully frames the desolation of the piece, using almost monochromatic shots of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Seen through the eyes of a grieving parent, Venice becomes something silent and menacing, and is complemented by a score that is reminiscent of 'Mildred Pierce' in its perfection.
John and Laura Baxter (Sutherland and Christie) are staying in Venice after the accidental death of their little girl. John is restoring an old church, while his wife befriends two slightly sinister elderly British ladies, one of whom is a blind psychic. They tell Laura that their daughter is still alive, and through a series of enigmatic half-appearances (beautifully shot by Roeg, in a surreal and hazy fashion), the movie reaches a bizarre and jarring conclusion that leaves us deeply moved.
It's the contrast between the realistic portrayal of a parent's grief and the otherworldly quality of Venice and the psychic woman that is arguably the driving force behind the film. The beauty of 'Don't Look Now' is that manages to seamlessly couple the realistic, almost mundane, with the supernatural. Stellar performances from Christie and Sutherland complement the Oscar-worthy direction by Roeg, and bring us a deep sense of melancholia and isolation.

It was in Empire magazine's ""Greatest Horror Films Of All Time"" issue, but I don't know if I would call it a horror film at all. Even the box says ""a psychic thriller"", which it most certainly is. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are stupendous in their roles, but the best character in the movie is the Venice setting, helped out by the beautiful cinematography. The parallels between the slowly sinking city and Sutherland's downward spiral is made all the more real by the melancholy and dark feel of the scenery.

1218589,5,B00000I1DU,"You see the things I like about psychological horror films (ala The Exorcist, The Ring, Repulsion, and When A Stranger Calls) is that they are always unpredictable, they don't play by the rules of a typical horror film, and some manage to scarier after each viewing as more of the horror is understood. This is what people don't get about this film and The Blair Witch Project. It's what you don't see that scares you. Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now once seemed radically new with its kaleidoscopic imagery, dreamlike editing, and willingness to let mystery be mysterious on several levels of reality/illusion--plus art-house darling Julie Christie in a long, nude love scene! Nowadays, this 1974 adaptation of a Daphne du Maurier ghost story looks almost classical. Following the drowning of their child in England, Laura and John Baxter have come to dank, eternally dying Venice, where he is supervising the restoration of a moldering church and she is either slipping into or climbing out of madness with the help of a pair of creepy spinster sisters, one of whom can ""see"" even though blind. John may share this psychic power, though he resists accepting it as the canals fill with murder victims, surface realities turn shimmery as water, and a red-coated figure the daughter's ghost?

1218590,5,B00000I1DU,"This film is a masterpiece of mood, visual themes, cinematography, etc. etc. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that its reputation stems almost exclusively from its phenomenal capacity to create mood. The performances by Donald Sutherland and the gorgeous Julie Christie come straight from the gut, which I found somewhat startling, specially coming from Christie, such a classical and mannered actress. However, one gets the feeling that this film is intended to ""mean"" nothing, but merely to evoke, since the payoff is so famously jarring and flawed, keeping no rational relation to plausibility or even basic plot maintenance. After having seen this film for the first time, I originally thought myself incredibly stupid, for I could find no link whatsoever between the ending and the movie's plot and characters. Any sort of symbolism escaped and dodged me, which is strange, inasmuch as I am an English Lit major!! After further thought and consideration, however, I find that the film's ""open-endness"" is not a virtue, but rather a flaw. I read an interview with Roeg in which he himself seemed to be at a loss for words as to what the ending ""symbolized""!!! Nevertheless, my 5-star review stems, as I've said before, for the movie's sheer capacity to flat-out shock and create mood.
On a final note, mention must be made of the famous ""love scene"", intercut with post-coital shots of Christie and Sutherland dressing. This scene is, in my mind, the greatest sex scene of all time, and today's directors would be wise to review it: we never question the tenderness, ""togetherness"" and urgency of this couple's love-making, and the scene does not go for cheap hormonal thrills (as do inferior ""thrillers"", such as ""Basic Instinct""), but rather fits in beautifully within the mood of the picture... Christie and Sutherland make love as an almost-cathartical release of pent-up grief.
All in all, one of the greatest pieces of mood ever, yet one of the greatest flubbed endings in history, as well...!!",1049760000,7,2004,5.021021021021021
1218591,5,B00000I1DU,"""Don't Look Now"" is a fortuitous result of a great story (Daphne Du Maurier); subtle and artful direction (Nicolas Roeg); superb acting (Donald Sutherland & Julie Christie as the anguished couple in love); dazzling cinematography; and a perfect musical score.  I still remember the images and the impact from seeing this film in 1974-those images have been firmly planted in my brain for 29 years.  This is a powerful, enigmatic film.
It is interesting to watch this film back-to-back with ""The Exorcist.""  Both are psychological thrillers.  I feel that ""The Exorcist"" is the most frightening film ever made.  But ""The Exorcist"" relies on gross visual effects to prompt the psychological horror; ""Don't Look Now"" is much more subtle.
If you are a film maniac like me, it is also interesting to watch ""Don't Look Now"" with your sole focus being to observe the use of the color red.  It is pretty incredible.  And after this film, you can never think of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" in the same way.
And then there is the much discussed and analyzed ""sex scene.""  I prefer to think of it as the ""making love"" scene.  The cuts between the ""getting dressed"" and ""making love"" segments are amazing; the  ""getting dressed"" segments are just as erotic and convey the main characters' emotions just as powerfully as the ""making love"" parts.
I adore Julie Christie, and she is amazing in this film.
I place this film high on my list of ""films that make an impact.""  I highly recommend this DVD.  You will be moved!",1041984000,10,1501,4.7528957528957525
1218592,5,B00000I1DU,"This film had a shattering impact on me when I first saw it in the theater in its first run in 1974. I was in a jittery state for several weeks, and had many dreams and nightmares influenced by it. ""The Exorcist"" had come out at the same time, a well-made but conventional horror film. ""Don't Look Now"" is far from conventional and much more deeply frightening if one is receptive to its elusive mood. It has an avant garde editing and directorial style by the sophisticated English cinematographer-turned-director, Nicholas Roeg, whose other films include the experimental ""Performance"" with Mick Jagger, the brilliantly photographed ""Walkabout"" set in the Australian outback, and the surreal ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" starring David Bowie.
Roeg's intimate, first-hand knowledge of cinematography influences the manner in which the supernatural is suggested, with simple yet unsettling shots of ordinary but sinister objects, vague streetcorners, deep shadows, or fleeting figures disappearing behind buildings. Despite the main setting in picturesque Venice, the realism of the style ties these eerie images to everyday experience.
The entire film in a sense is an attempt at re-defining what the supernatural really is. Not slimy zombies or ghosts in white shrouds but strange coincidences in otherwise ordinary images - tiles of a mosaic being shattered by a footstep, or a pane of glass being broken by a bicycle wheel. These little unexplained connections between events accumulate over the course of the film, and then are all brought together in the powerful and terrifying finale.
Pino Donnagio's music score adds immeasureably to the atmosphere, and later caused Brian de Palm to use the composer for the scores of ""Carrie,"" ""Blowout"" and ""Dressed to Kill."" This morose but romantic Italian is one of the few film composers able to supply a music score as vivid as the great Bernard Herrmann.
Donald Sutherland brings his method realism to a fine pitch in the role of the psychic yet skeptical modern man - a disbelieving soul who is nevertheless restoring an ancient church. And the delicate, fragile beauty and understated yet deeply felt acting of Julie Christie is perfect for the role of his loving but grief-stricken wife.
Quite simply there has never been another film like this one. Though Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" is a noble attempt at creating a similar intense and weird atmosphere, there will probably never be another. It is truly a unique creation and certainly one of the finest films about the supernatural ever made.
The DVD has few extras, but is an excellent transfer, extremely crisp and clear. Probably one doesn't need extras with this film, because it is a deliberate and inexplicable cinematic enigma. In a day when dumbed-down films beat one over the head with their often idiotic plots, it is immensely refreshing and inspiring to see such a work of subtle cinematic art as ""Don't Look Now.""",1041033600,8,2926,5.1106471816283925
1218593,5,B00000I1DU,"When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was so captivated by it that I went back the next day and saw it again. (It was so overwhelming that I couldn't think of anything else, anyway.) I just dug around in my files, and (miraculously!) found the review I wrote December 31, 1973. It was long, but here are parts of it:
I started with a description of du Maurier's original story (it wasn't a novel): ""An English couple vacationing in Venice meets up with two Scottish women, twins, one blind and 'psychic.' She tells them--or the wife, Laura, as the husband wants nothing to do with them--that their recently-drowned daughter is with the couple, that she is happy and wants them to be happy, and that they should leave Venice because there is 'danger.' A telegram from England that their son is sick sends Laura back on the first plane, with John to follow by train. But before he leaves he sees Laura and the twins boating down the Grand Canal, and certain that the twins have done something to his wife he starts searching the sinking city for them. That's as far as I'll take this synopsis.
""The film is practically a textbook exampke of how to turn a printed story into a movie. For instance, the telegram from England is turned into a phone call. Beyond that, there is a care taken with the characters that du Maurier did not bother with: The minor characters are, all of them (with one necessary exception that I won't go into here, and the sisters--not twins--who remain enigmatic), are more than one-dimensional. No-one is there only for his plot purposes. Everyone with a part bigger than a walk-on has a little scene in which he gets to show us a little about himslef that isn't necessary for us to know, but which fleshes out his personality. The major change is to make John not a vacationer; he is in Venice not to relax but to work.
""I could go on and on about the film: the acting (Donald Sutherland is great, Julie Christie the best I've seen her), the photography (rich and beautiful; Venice is strikingly, almost attractively, ugly), the music, everything. I highly recommend this movie.""
I recommended seeing the movie without reading the story first--or at all--""except in this case: If suspense in a movie theater, where there are no commercials and you can't put the book down briefly, might cause you some anguish (I'm being serious here), read the story first so you know what to expect, and just enjoy the movie as a movie.""
So, as you can see, even when I was in my early 20s I didn't find the movie slow, or nothing but symbolism, or any of the other complaints by the minority here. And seeing it again now, on this beautiful DVD, hasn't changed my opinion. It's marvelous. I find it interesting that I didn't even mention the sex scene in my review, though it certainly was then and is still now a great scene, the cross-cutting very appropriate to the characters and where they are in their lives.
My best friend then wrote me a long letter explaining to me that I was totally wrong about the film, that it was too arty and too mechanical and too long (""a two-hour toothache"") and besides, it scared him too much....
I think you should risk the toothache, in case it turns out you like it as much as I do.",1040947200,6,3241,4.494915254237288

The psychic lady can see their lost daughter, however, she also senses a dark looming future drawing near.  The rhetorical question is what is it that she sees, and who else sees it?  Don't Look Now is an intriguing film that uses images as evidence for future events, however, the whole experience seems slow, tiresome, and repetitive.",1036022400,,702,5.241071428571429
1218596,2,B00000I1DU,"A 90 minute film (at best) that drags on and on with trite direction and irritating editing.
Donald Sutherland plays one unlucky restorator in Venice. Planks of wood fling themselves at him as well as kitchen utensils. I'm surprised he dared even touch the food. Mind you, his wife knocked over the table, so he's sort of lucky after all. Or is he? (DAN!DAN!) This is what happens when you hang around off season. Does all human life really vanish at that time of the year? In one funny scene, Sutherland is followed by a detective and fails to spot him in a crowd of, er...well, pigeons. Later, he, his wife and a tourist from Middle Earth all chase each other around in a Keystone Cops manner that gets the giggles going. God knows, we needed the laughs. In one truly boring scene Sutherland explains himself to an enigmatic official which Roeg decided to bore us with all over again in 'Bad Timing'. The cameraman zooms into Sutherland on the couch. Why? I don't know. In the Seventies they always seemed to hit the zoom at the earliest opportunity. Frankly, I miss it. So does Micheal Winner, I bet.
Meanwhile, everyone in the neighbourhood including the priest seems to be psychic. Is it the coffee? Perhaps years of evolution in Venice has given everyone a sixth sense after falling into the drink one time too many. Perhaps that is why the tourist from Middle Earth is so disgruntled. He couldn't quite make the gap on to the Gondoler and has been stuck in Venice ever since. And there's like nobody, and I mean NOBODY to talk to off season except two crazy old ladies and a nutty landlord. Wouldn't you be a little miffed?
Then there is the much vaunted sex scene. Just why is Donald Sutherland scrabbling down the back of Julie Christie, has he lost a comb? Suddenly he starts getting very amorous with her foot. This man has major problems. Why do they suddenly bounce off the bed and start battering at the wardrobe in a mad jumble? Is this why the love scene has dressing footage interposed? It all means something. And you have plenty of time never to work it out.
The allegedly scary ending might have been more effective if the director hadn't decided to keep flashbacking the image, reducing it's impact. Might I suggest the diminutive chappie mail himself home in a box and stop taking it all out on other people? Don't look now, here comes the Gnome Service.",1034208000,8,2376,4.566744730679157

I would finally get a chance to see what the fuss was about. Pretty much everything you've heard about this film is true, the sex scenes do seem 'very real' (hint, hint), the cinematography is breathtaking yet surreal and offputting (the whole point) and the final scene is truly shocking. However, what comes along with these positive elements is a rather turgid and lacklustre film that rather than building up an oppressive atmosphere rather begins to shuffle back and forwards over an endless stream of Venice bridges till the climax. Though I had waited a long time to see this film, about three quarters of the way my attention began to wander as too many strange things were suggested and occasionally seen but not explained. Cool if you like that sort of thing (and I usually do). It's just that when it never seems to take you anywhere, that's about the point I tune out. This is an extremely slow film in every sense of the word and if there's one trait you must possess to get something out of this film, it's patience. For those who persevere, the ending is worth the lengthy running time whereas for others, it may be a little too easy to turn the film off and not spare another thought about it's conclusion.",1033603200,4,1441,4.589147286821706
1218598,5,B00000I1DU,"Nicolas Roeg was building his name as a director of mysterious and edgy films in the early 70s. ""Don't Look Now,"" which followed ""Walkabout"" and preceded ""The Man Who Fell to Earth,"" featured Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland in Daphne Du Maurier's tale of ESP and death in Venice. Paramount has released the film as part of its Widescreen Collection. Alas, there are no extras beyond a first-rate trailer. ""Don't Look Now"" is best remembered for its shocking ending and for the stars' did-they-or-didn't-they? sex scene. (My vote: ... yes, watch her face). The movie has lost none of its terrible beauty, or its ability to trigger near-heart attacks. Roeg's cameras wander the back streets and swollen canals of Venice, soaking up the ages in Technicolor. A lot of the film is cast in shadows, with low-light grain present in many of the indoor scenes. The Dolby Digital audio is OK, forcefully delivering the organ music of doom.",1032825600,,934,4.917721518987341
1218599,3,B00000I1DU,"Nicholas Roeg's stylish thriller ""Don't Look Now"" is made with such nerve-jangling invention it's guaranteed not to look or move like anyone else's work. From start to finish it's an original, so marvelously textured and polished, you want all the artful technique to have a point beyond the penny-dreadful purpose underlying it.
A former cinematographer, Roeg's movies are almost compulsively ""visual,"" all angle, light, color, texture and editing. One bravura sequence follows another: the opening drowning of Christie and Sutherland's daughter; their famous tussle together in bed; Sutherland's nearly fatal accident as he examines a decaying mosaic, all shot and cut in quick, impressionistic fragments, interwoven and juxtaposed with silky fluency. And the pleasures aren't purely technical, with plenty of wry touches at the edges: the obsequious behavior of the Italian hotel clerk where Christie and Sutherland are staying, for example, or the barely concealed eagerness with which the masters of an English school shepherd a nervous Christie out of their house.
It's all wonderfully sophisticated and understated. When wed to the conventional thriller requirements of ""Don't Look Now,"" though, this floating, languorous anxiety seems just a tad too self-consciously pretty to be entirely appropriate. The atmosphere of everyday dread resulting from Roeg's touches works, all right, but it borders on the insulting to have so much skill lavished on such trashy material. This is a story, after all, that requires we believe in warnings from the Great Beyond, that invites Blind Faith as a form of therapy and that posits the possibility not just of precognition, but preternatural insight thousands of miles from the event.
Paramount has done an uncharacteristically good job of serving the movie in the DVD. In fact, the transfer is perhaps a touch *too* good. Images nearly unintelligible in projection here have a vivid presence that both works for and against the thriller premise. With so much more visible, the sense of rot and decay is almost palpable. On the other hand, sequences that rely on the darkness tend to get blunted a bit when everything is out in the open to be seen.
Which is perhaps another way of saying that the disc's producers responded to what gives the movie its distinction, the sexy, sensuous surfaces, rather than the Gothic horror that are their excuse.",1032652800,5,2393,5.283464566929134

1218601,5,B00000I1DU,"Those who reject the notion of coincidence and dare to inspect a more fragile geometry of space and time will embrace this spellbinding classic which was overlooked in 1974 due to the brouhaha over ""The Exorcist"" and its camp shenanigans.
John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) returns to watery Venice, Italy on the heels of his young daughter drowning  to work on the church faade restoration of the face of Christ. The art restorationist spirals deeper into a web of ESP and quantum physics which he dismisses as ""mumbo-jumbo"", and refuses to confront his intuitive side... and his profound sense of guilt.
Director Roeg seduces viewers with a split-second 8 minute what-was-that-I-think-I-saw opening unlike anything ever conceived, then turns suspense and horror cliches inside out to reveal a heartbreaking portrait of a married couple wrestling with the worst grief - the death of a child.
""Don't Look Now"" remains one of the most thought-provoking, troubling films ever made; Julie Christie shimmers as Sutherland's fragile wife.  Massimo Serato turns in an enigmatic performace as the troubled Father Barbaraggio, who ""wishes he didn't have to believe in prophecy"" and whose ""father also died in a fall.""  Pino Donaggio (Carrie, Blow Out) delivers his first film score in all of its Venetian, Vivaldi-induced splendor and melancholy; those organs rushing in at the 'denouement' chill to the bone as the sweet strings fall soon behind, and Christie's radiance in the foreground of that music remains one of cinema's greatest moments. Music lovers will also appreciate his tribute to the ""Lover's Concerto"" during the erotic, tender love scene much discussed on these pages.
""Don't Look Now"" warns all with its title to overlook, to forgive, to get on, but the great, gothic trick is that no one who looks outside himself for meaning can take his eyes off of it.
Needless to say, viewers who think ""Scream"" is a horror film will be lost and/or bored.  This is the thoughtful, reflective man or woman's territory, not for consumers who want to be babysat for two hours.

""Don't Look Now"" is a great film and one of the best horror films ever made--a ghost story that not only evokes the atmosphere of Daphne Du Maurier's story but elaborates on its themes of grief and dislocation.

It is a complex, puzzeling, chilling horror film and it one is one of Nicolas Roeg's greatest achievements as a director.
  I had an old VHS copy of it and apparently Paramount used the nastiest print they could find for release. I suffered with this beast for years and when I heard that it was finally coming to DVD, I was very excited at the possibility of seeing the film the way it was meant to be seen. If you love this film as much as I do then GRAB THIS DVD!!!!!
  When I first saw this DVD I must admit I was a bit thrown. I had seen the film for so long on tape that when watching it on DVD it's like seeing a different film. Apparently Roeg shot it in 1:33:1 and simply matted it to 1:85:1 for release. This means that information is lost at the top and bottom of the screen but I assure you this is not a promblem. The composition of the shots are much better in 1:85:1. The colors are VERY strong and the picture is sharp and clear(although there is grain visible in some shots). My only complaint is the audio. It's in mono and it is very weak and sounds tinny at times. A full stereo mix would have been great.
  And one more thing. This is the EXTENDED VERSION of the film and that means a steamier love scene between Sutherland and Christie. Some extra features would have been nice but I'm happy just to have it on DVD at last.",1031184000,,1654,4.058282208588957
1218604,5,B00000I1DU,"The first time I ever heard of Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" was in an audio interview with British singer, Kate Bush. She said she pratically begged actor, Donald Sutherland to be in one of her music videos, after viewing this film. This aroused my curiousity and the first chance I got, I saw it. Well, now I understand what Miss Bush was talking about, because ""Don't Look Now"" is simply a brilliant puzzle of a film. This psychological (or should I say psychic) thriller involves a married couple (actors Donald Sutherland & Julie Christie)who experience the tragic death of their young daughter. While trying to get over their grief, they go on a business trip to Venice, where Sutherland is helping to restore an old Catholic church. It is during this trip, that the couple get involved in a horrifying psychic adventure. Director Nicolas Roeg has constructed a fascinating, enigmatic film, which will leave you on the edge of your seat. The city of Venice that he presents is downright eerie in atmosphere with a sense of forboding for the main characters. Actors, Sutherland & Christie both give amazing performances of a loving couple, who are trying to sort through their grief. This is simply great acting. In one of my favorite scenes of the movie, Roeg shows the couple making love, while he cross cuts shots of them getting ready for dinner. I think this is one of the most artful, sensual & erotic protrayles of two people making love ever shown in a mainstream film. The sexual act is protrayed as simply another moment of tenderness in the life of a caring, married couple. This is great film which is loaded with atmosphere, suspense and finally horror. The 'Twilight Zone'-like ending literally made me jump out of my chair. This is one of those movies (like ""The Sixth Sense"") where multiple viewings are required to pick up all the clues that are presented. It is a film that stays with you long after it is over.

1218605,5,B00000I1DU,"Director Nicholas Roeg brought this gem to the screen in the beginning of his switchover from cinematographer to film director.  It may be that his work here is so good simply because his visual powers were so strong from all those years with a camera as his partner.  As a director, he would progressively be pulled away from that all visual, solitary world of the camera.  He had a dream duo of Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie who play a married couple in Venice during the winter trying to come to some terms with the death of their child.  They are haunted at every turn and Venice enhances that effect instead of lessening it.  By turns erotic and supernaturally chilling, Roeg makes this film his own and it is still as startlingly unique today as it was decades ago when it was first made.  I'm sure it will be a big seller on DVD and it deserves to be.

The extras on the UK edition of this DVD includes a half-hour documentary in which Nick Roeg and some of the production team are interviewed about this classic movie. They talk at length about that scene -- apparently they hired a hotel room for an afternoon without telling anyone else what they were doing, and the whole thing was filmed in 90 minutes by Roeg and his handheld, the cameraman and sound recordist. You get the distinct impression that they still feel sworn to secrecy over what really happened on that day. Sadly neither Christie nor Sutherland are interviewed.  (Please note: this documentary does not appear on the US release of the DVD, according to a note I have received from William Ing.)
But ""Don't Look Now"" is also famous as one of the great psychological thriller films. There's very little blood and gore, but a lot of horror, with two loving parents trying to confront their grief in gloomy, wintry Venice. Roeg eliminated red from most of the scenes -- down to insisting that none of the actors wore red clothes -- so that when the red mackintosh appears, it has a startling impact. This is a mystery film about coincidences -- only at the very end do all the loose ends start to tie up.
Without saying whether Daphne Du Maurier liked the film overall, Roeg says in the documentary that she entirely recognised the depiction of the leading couple. This is a movie you really ought to see, but you'll never feel entirely safe in nocturnal Venice again.
It has to be said that the sound quality of the movie is muffled.",1028678400,7,1677,4.608695652173913
1218609,5,B00000I1DU,"This film, which features Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland at their most young and gorgeous, may be one of the scariest movies ever made.
Based on a Daphne DuMaurier story, it concerns two grieving parents (Christie and Sutherland) who have lost their young daughter in a horrible drowning accident right on their opulent English estate. Mourning beyond reason, the shattered couple goes to Venice, where Sutherland repeatedly sees visions of his dead daughter, always just out of reach.
Through disjointed stream-of-consciousness images, gorgeous views of Venice, lush colors, eerie people with second sight, and one of the most erotic love scenes on film, we feel this couple's anguish, fear and desperate love for one another. And we know, simply by feeling it, that there is great danger lurking just out of sight. But we don't know what it is.
As the suspense builds unbearably, the viewer is mesmerized by the photography, the music, the beauty--and yes, the grief. And when the end comes...well, let's just say that you'll want to leave the lights on for many nights to come.
An absolutely brilliant film.",1024617600,51,1116,5.103825136612022
1218610,5,B00000I1DU,"On a bright autumn day a little girl drowns in a pond near her home. Her unsuspecting parents, John (Donald Sutherland) and Laura Baxter(Julie Christie) are discussing idly when suddenly, and against any logic, John, overcome by a feeling that something is wrong, bursts out of the house. He finds the small body floating and drained from life; his howl of desperation signals the tragedy and absurd terror that are only just beginning to unfold.
 Still grieving the loss of their daughter, the Baxters go to Venice where John is working as an architect in charge of a church restoration. They are still trying to cope and collect the pieces of their broken lives when they meet two strange sisters, Heather, who is blind and claims to be a medium, and Wendy. Laura collapses when Heather tells her that she has ""seen"" her dead daughter and that she is happy. When Laura comes round she is in a state of abnormal elation, convinced that the spirit of her daughter is still with her. John has none of that but much to his frustration Laura falls under the spell of the two sisters. Heather warns the Baxters that something terrible will happen to them. Her prophecy is partly fulfilled when John has a near fatal accident in the church. At the same time the Venetian police is puzzling over the identity of a murderer dispatching bodies in the canals. John and Laura have an intimate if rather brief encounter back in their hotel. But bliss and happiness will not last. Not for them, not any more. Their relation strains under the combined weights of paranoid fear, guilt, anxiety and death. The ending of the film is the missing bit of the puzzle - merciless, unforgiving, shocking. And all that is left is the desperation of a lonely tragedy.
 ""Don't Look Now"", based on a Daphne Du Maurier story, is a multilayered masterpiece and arguably Roeg's finest film. This is one of the select few films where the form informs the content and the content is reinforcing the narrative structure and the formal vision of the director. Roeg weaves an almost experimental narrative where illusion takes over from reality. His editing makes deliberate use of subliminal images that surface meaningfully only at the end. Against any conceivable cinematic convention, Roeg shifts freely from present to past and then to future events. Flash-backs and flash-forwards succeed in conveying a sense of psychological disorientation, reflected in the labyrinthine structure of Venice. The film is superficially about premonitions and faith. But the leitmotif is the fleeting nature of love and the omnipresence of death. Death is the dark companion that walks with John and Laura in the foggy Venetian alleys. Their genuine love and understanding for each other cannot save them from the certainty that all you love will one day perish. But it is their love scene that ultimately lingers in mind; Roeg interspersed masterfully this scene with routine daily tasks (Laura taking a bath, John brushing his teeth, both dressing to go out) thus conveying the intimacy that governs the married life of John and Laura. Time and again people have noted that the love scene looks and feels authentic (without ever being gratuitous), so much so, that some are convinced that Sutherland and Christie were actually making love. Be that as it may, it is Roeg's directorial mastery that imbues the scene with flesh and blood and brings it to life: John and Laura are genuinely in love. Very rarely before or after this film has a director ventured so successfully in romanticising married life.
 The poignant use of Venice as a backdrop to the drama is a masterstroke. Roeg treats the old city, as many others have observed, as an additional character. The cinematography is brilliant, Venice is shot in a Caravaggio-like chiaroscuro, winter colours bringing to the fore a dark and sinister character surely not to be witnessed by summer visitors. This is a dreamy, quasi-magical world, complete with mirrors, carnival masks, dwarfs and crumbling churches. At the end of the day, Venice is reflecting the emotional state of the Baxters. John and Laura loose themselves in Venetian alleys in the same way they loose their grip on reality. The emptiness of the city during the winter mirrors the emotional vacuum and desolation in their hearts after the loss of their daughter. The additional subplot of the murders in the city is crucial as it creates an ever tightening noose of suspicion, anxiety, fear and death.
 Pino Donagio's score is spot on, evocative and haunting at the same time. Sutherland and Christie are impeccable, offering understated, sensitive and nuanced performances. Christie has an outstanding autumnal beauty and kindness, ever so slightly teetering on the edge. Sutherland, in a great male tragic role, is resigned to the facts of life, and provides a performance which is difficult to be matched (as indeed is the wig he is wearing throughout the film).
 Without a shadow of a doubt this is a difficult film to watch, what with the shattering ending or the complex narrative. Yet it is crystal clear that it has the rare profundity only to be found in a handful of films. It rewards multiple viewings and I warmly recommend it.",1023926400,17,5219,4.9194097616345065
1218611,4,B00000I1DU,"I must say, this movie definately falls under the same category as other excellent films about the supernatural (i.e. The Sixth Sense and What Lies Beneath). And like those films that would come nearly three decades later, this film has an unexpected plot twist that makes you think and takes you by surprise. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are nothing but excellent in the roles they are given, and the plot is definately, and enjoyably ambiguous. Not only are there plenty of twists and turns in this film, there are plenty of shocking moments that are just unexpected. Truth be told, I think the lovemaking scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie was really the real thing. Much like the ones depicted between Sir Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret in Magic and Bruce Dern and Maud Adams in Tatoo. Overall, Don't Look Now is a very suspenseful horror art film. One that is not only a classic, but one that is truly bound to make you jump and think about a few things.
If you like this film with Donald Sutherland, you will also like his roles in MASH, The Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Bear Island, Revolution, and Ordinary People.",1015286400,,1147,4.768844221105527
1218612,4,B00000I1DU,"This is an under appreciated mystery. Partly because there were so many occult films made in the early 70's it was easy to lose track of the fact that some of them were much more interesting than others. Roeg is not interested in linear narrative. In fact as a cinematographer he is more interested in using unique shots to give us glimpses into his characters subjective goings on than he is in forwarding a plot. Some call that arty and maybe it is. Roeg began as a cinematographer as Stanley Kubrick did and like Kubrick he has learned that camera angles and lighting can tell as much story as events and dialogue, both are masters at the art of cinema so perhaps that makes them arty. However Kubrick never forgot to tell a story while performing his magnificent art, Roeg sometimes forgets that without a story the technical sleights of hand sometimes seem wasted or meaningless. I think this film has a lot going for it and may be enjoyed for the way it looks and the way it keeps you wondering what is going on. I like that kind of movie, there were a lot of them in this time period perhaps it was the influence of the European directors. Roeg certainly learned some tricks from Antonioni, another brilliant technician.
In addition to all the impressive and exciting cinematic devices being put to use there is a barely discernable story being told. Nothing or not much is literally told to us but we slowly gather impressions, bits of data, and possibilities begin to form as to what really is going on. The fact that it is based on a short story by a mystery writer should clue you in that a)its a mystery and b)there is not much story development. There are however a lot of charged scenes and unsettling atmospheres where there is some kind of emotional currency in the air and it is all the more powerful for being unidentifiable. The ultimate revelation is a surprise and I won't spoil it for you. Sutherland and Christie  both give appropriately subtle and understated performances.
I think this picture is for people who like distinct directorial styles. Roeg uses many lingering camera shots where everything is an objective correlative for something else, some inner state. A very moody picture,  an unconventional psychological mystery.",1007596800,7,2255,4.720812182741117
1218613,5,B00000I1DU,"""Wenn ich ein anderes wort fr musik suche, so finde ich immer nur das wort Venedig""
These immortal words by Nietzsche conserning on of Europe's most beautiful and picturesque cities must have been conceived on a bright summerdag buzzing with vibrant citylife.
The Venice portraied in this movie is the flip-side of the coin; Venice in the off-season period, void of tourists, desolate, sombre and almost menacing; in short the complete antithesis to the above ""tourist-brochure"" version of Venice.
""Don't Look Now"" is loosely based on a Daphne du Maurier thriller and is the movie equivalent of a jigsaw puzzle, with the added twist that some of the peices seems to be missing, leaving it up to the veiwer to ""fill in the blanks"", and therein lies the real genious of the directing-style of Nicolas Roeg.
Roeg had already proved himself to be a master with a camera as director of photography on such stylistic extravaganzas as ""Casino Royale"" and ""Farenheit 451"", but as a director he was criticized for sacrificing a coherent storyline in favor of his idiosyncratic, incomparable camerastyle.
And sure enough, ""Don't Look Now"" is full of almost subliminal imagery where the clues go by in split-seconds, but to my mind that is just what makes this movie such a thrill to watch.  Roeg's use of the color red and the alternating between the surreal and the mundane is in a league of it's own...
On a surface-level, the movie deals with the couple of Christie and Sutherland and their grieving-process after the tragic death of their daughter, while Sutherland works on the restauration of a Venice church, but the real clues as to understanding the truly spooky climax to the movie is actually to be found in the events going on underneath the aforementioned surface-level storyline, and although you admittedly have to keep your eyes peeled to catch all the necessary clues, the famous missing peice of the puzzle actually falls into place in the most exquisitely wicked way in the closing frames.
Failing to catch these necessary clues will in all likelihood result in the viewer being frustrated and dismissing the movie as being disjointed and pointless, while the alert viewer will be grinning slyly form ear to ear from having just experienced an esoteric, gothic movie masterpeice.
Donald Sutherland was never better than in ""Don't Look Now"" and Julie Christie is positively radiant, grief-struck and exquisitely understated sexy at the same time.  The much talked about sex-scene, ingeniously mixed with images of their post-coital mood while they get ready to go out, is one of the most believable and intimate ever captured on film.
Pino Donaggio's beautiful score also has to be mentioned....
This movie is the result of the unique vision and talent of Nicolas Roeg, and result is pure magic ....",995414400,5,2807,4.982942430703624
1218614,1,B00000I1DU,"One can sort of appreciate this movie after the fact.  Afterall, the cyclical way in which it is created lends well to re-viewings.  Still, that first sitting can be hard to swallow.  ""Don't Look Now"" is, essentially, a film with no narrative.  It just goes on and on, with things happening which are really of no interest to the viewer.  The story is long and drawn out, the acting is stiff, and sound quality is rather poor.  This movie does have an ending similar to ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Carnival of Souls"", or ""Angel Heart"", which makes you want to watch it again to see all of the connections.  But, then you remember how boring the majority of the movie actually was, and you change your mind.  And, as for the love scene: if seeing Donald Sutherland naked is your idea of a good time, then more power to you.  But, for the rest of us, the love scene is just plain gross.
It is ""artsy"", but it is, more than anything else, clunky.  There is a reason why this film is out of print.  It should probably stay that way.",989366400,17,1020,4.315789473684211
1218615,5,B00000I1DU,"This is a fascinating film from a filmmaker who, in recent years, seems sadly responsible for his lack of reknown; Roeg hasn't made a movie this rich or ambitious in a long, long time. Based on a Daphne DuMaurier story, this tale of the supernatural, set in Venice, is extremely intelligent, and opens doors for much analysis of how and why thoughts of the supernatural obsess people as they do. Roeg's interest in self-reflexivity in cinema, more fully realized in BAD TIMING, is invoked here as well; Sutherland and Christie give excellent performances; and, lowbrow as it seems to say this, the sex scene between them is one of the most interesting and intense in the history of mainstream cinema. It's a great, flawless thriller -- though if you think you might be a moron, you'd probably best stay away from it; it's no slasher movie.

Genius is an over used term, but it holds true for this piece of cinematic history. This film is a visual delight and enchantment. The power of director, over actor as a tool for the creator, is so apparent in this masterpiece of film.

As both a gothic horror and a study of human grief, ""Don't Look Now"" offers up a vision of end-of-season Venice that is both sombre and sinister.  Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a couple visiting Venice after the accidental death of their young daughter. Both actors are truly believable, and their love scene is one of the most touching and erotic you will ever see.  Sutherland is haunted by fleeting glimpses of a small, red cloaked figure amongst the alleyways and canals, and the plot itself has as many twists and turns as the city in which it is set. Fine acting, an emotionally resonant score from Pino Donaggio and inspired direction on the part of Nicholas Roeg make this an unforgettable masterpiece.  It is no exaggeration to say that the penultimate scene is one of the most chilling ever made, but a second viewing reveals the poignancy behind the horror.",980726400,10,962,4.8121212121212125
1218618,3,B00000I1DU,"Mainstream critics have virtually ignored this subdued little gothic, but cable TV has exhumed it from obscurity.
While Roeg does have a flair for color and setting (Venice provided the best possible backdrop), the other  logistics are awkward and umpolished. Movement and interaction is clumsy  and unnatural. Poor sound quality muffles out much of the key dialogue. The  music is misguided and incongruous with the scenes.

It changed my life and my way of 'seeing' forever, and  after repeated viewings over the last two odd decades, I still learn more  everytime I return to stare in the abyss.  Julie Christie was never  lovelier, and Pino Donaggio's score remains his first and finest  accomplishment.  And to think that cranky old Pauline Kael called it  ""chic trash"" upon its release.

1218620,5,B00000I1DU,"Don't Look Now, loosely based on a mediocre Daphne Du Maurier short story, is Nic Roeg's best film, and is packed with compelling paradoxes of time and space. This film has the simplest of plots but tampers with the  `natural chronology of things', experimenting with flashbacks and indeed  flashforwards. The viewer is taken from the present and plunged without  warning into various sections of the story's time-scale. The audience must  be constantly alerted to differentiate between dream sequences, reality,  episodes from the past, events from the present and even premonitions of  the future. This has a profoundly disquieting effect on us, and most of the  film's power is derived from this. We are offered clues, associations,  images and ambiguities, but never provided with answers. Don't Look Now is  just that, an extremely entertaining puzzle.
The Baxters of Roeg's film  inhabit a dark, shadowy labyrinthine world of bridges and mirrors that  could only be Venice. Architect Sutherland and wife Christie are on a  working holiday recovering from the recent drowning of their little girl,  and this setting perfectly mirrors their internal grief and their feelings  of uncertainty and guilt. The fractured time sequence gives the film a  coldness, helping with the atmosphere of marital chill.
Some of my  favourite moments committed to film are here: the chilling opening drowning  sequence, the greatest love-making scene ever (in which the most believable  coupling between actors without showing actual penetration, is inter-cut  with their getting dressed for dinner) and the most deeply disturbing  denouement that will ever disrupt your sleep pattern.
All this, and  Roeg's vivid stylistics, the superb use of dissolves (rarely used in  commercial film) to give the proceedings a nightmarish quality, wonderfully  tonal mood-lighting, blood symbolism (little girl in the red  rain-coat...spilt red wine on slide projectors...clothes on washing-lines  reflected in canal water...)
A dark tale of madness, magic and murderous  intent, the blurring of reality and illusion, of drowned children and  homicidal dwarfs; brought to life by truly great film-making, editing and  the best performances of their careers from Sutherland and  Christie.

While there, Sutherland runs into trouble as he keeps narrowly escaping  near-death experiences, the most dramatic of which occurs when he is on a  scaffold inside an old church. Both Sutherland and Christie continue to see  a small figure, dressed in the same raincoat that their little girl used to  wear, running through the alleys of Venice. What little dialogue there is  plays a supporting role to the film's stunning and, at times, harrowing  visuals, accentuated in a highly erotic love scene. Everything, even the  most horrific moments, are kept moving at a slow, dreamy pace. Skillful  foreshadowing, combined with the characters' own prescience, make for an  uneasy, haunting, but ultimately transcendent film experience.
