3588501,5,B001FSHM70,I enjoyed this DVD.  It helped me to add something else to my dance repertoire.  The DVD was easy to follow and you can stop it any time to review each section or beat combinations.  I felt like Michelle was right them teaching me the zills one on one.  A must for a beginner.  Not only do you learn how to play the zills to different beats; you also learn to play them with dance combinations.  Michelle's drills are great to reinforcing the beat counts and dance steps to memory.  It becomes second nature to play the zills.,1234742400,2,526,4.3061224489795915
3588502,1,B001FSHM70,"At last, someone who knows that the plural of zill is ziller, not zills.
However, I have some problems with the lack of information provided concerning this product.
The statement is made that the DVD covers 16 patterns for ziller.  It would be helpful if the time signatures, or names for these patterns were provided in the blurb.
I have been playing ziller for over 30 years, and know many patterns.  I am also ever on the lookout for new variations and patterns.
Although this product sounds promising, I would hesitate to buy it until more information on the content is provided.",1231977600,,584,4.715686274509804
3588503,5,B001FSHM70,"I went from someone who couldn't zill what-so-ever...having a terrible time learning zills in classes, to actually being able to play the zills! Michelle's DVD is wonderful in helping you learn how to play the zills...I find the screen with her hands showing and telling you which side(Right or Left) VERY helpful...most teach it too fast for me personally, and I have a lot of trouble following along with someone just telling me Right, Left Right...and so on, and I find when I have something to read to learn with, it really helps! I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who would like to learn how to play the finger cymbals!
Part 3 is where you actually get to do dance combinations while playing your zills...I have not gotten this far yet, but it looks really helpful.",1229644800,4,780,4.659420289855072
3588504,5,B001FSHM70,"I'm so grateful that Michelle puts out such high quality DVDs at affordable prices. There are other BD producers out there who cost twice as much for DVDs that don't contain as much valuable content as this one production. You will not regret buying it, and you will have material to use for at least a year. Michelle's not only a gratuitious instructor, she really puts an effort to break things down to their most basic level. Have patience! Playing your finger cymbals as fast as she does takes time. If you're debating which zill DVD to purchase, spend your money on this one.",1229040000,14,580,4.586538461538462
3588505,5,B001FSHM70,"Over the past year or so, no other videos are as eagerly awaited as those from Michelle Joyce. Dancer, producer, fitness instructor Michelle has got her finger right on the pulse of what the belly dance learner wants. Some of her videos have become absolute must-haves for dancers of all levels.

To begin with, there is something deeply satisfying about the menus on Michelle Joyce's videos. At one glance you can see what's on offer and how it's all laid out. And it always looks good, giving you a sense of logic, completeness and neatness. Explanations and practice sessions are typically separated. The menu on Killer Ziller is backed up with good solid content. After the introduction and positioning of the video, Michelle spends some time telling you about the cymbals, how to wear them and keep them on, how to strike them, and so on, with lots of tips.
Then we go straight on to understand 14 different zill playing patterns that correspond to common drum rhythms. Michelle explains the breakdown of the pattern that the two hands will be playing by getting you to tap it out on your stomach along with her. This is a clever way of going about it as the sensation will help you ""get it"" better. You speak out the counts and the right-lefts as you tap. You use this method to go through all the patterns. On the bottom of the screen, the rhythms and counts for the patterns show up. You could choose to go through all the rhythms and do several rounds of that until you are familiar with the lot. Or you could replay each separate chunk depending on which you choose to work with.  For me, this tapping trick really works because it's the natural way I've approached rhythms. In fact I've found I ""know"" many of the patterns already, perhaps from hearing them often in music. In fact I find I can play the zills almost immediately. It's just dancing with them that's a big challenge.

The main section of this video that drills the patterns takes you through what you learnt in the previous section but this time with zills. Here of course, you discover that playing the zills doesn't come quite as easily as tapping your tummy. I managed the easier ones immediately. The super fast ones are another story. On screen, Michelle holds up the zills so tthat all you see is the hands playing them. You also see the name of the rhythm, the pattern, the patter-strike counts and the rights and lefts count. You have to watch the screen to see when patterns are changing. Here again, you use your rewind to practice a particular rhythm more. Or skip to one that you want to work with. This section uses one method of playing - which is fair enough. Some instructors apparently alternate the dominance of the hands going right left right and then left right left so that both hands are equally strong at playing. But Michelle sticks to one dominant hand - and this is a big relief to me because that's the way I was playing ""naturally"" when I fooled around with the zills before. Radio silence is maintained for this whole section and all you hear is the drumming and the zill sound. I particularly liked the different patterns for the beledi rhythm.

Four increasingly difficult combinations put the zill playing into action. Now this is where I think another section of simpler moves would have been in place. Perhaps playing zills with just some isolations where you're otherwise static , with some arm work, and with some exceedingly simple common travel steps. This would probably have helped those who have a particularly difficult time moving at all while playing zills.  On this video though Michelle has put in a big excerpt from Drills Drills Drills which is a grapevine drill which uses zills on top of the grapevine travelling step with layered isolations. This is a real smart addition and it would work very well for new zill players to do this section first, actually.

The combinations are quite a treasure and very intelligently created. Even from Level 1 you are going to have to keep track of many things. Some footwork, turns, moves, arm work, claps and zills. Even in the first combo, you will vary zill patterns. Nice meaty challenging combinations! Michelle recommends getting familiar with the dance part of the combination totally before using the zills. And yes, the combinations are danceable without zills altogether if one wants to use them elsewhere. Each combination is explained in its own separate section and then practiced in the next section.
The hike in difficulty in the second combination goes up because of more zill pattern changes. There's also more arm work. I find to my horror that the control over zills goes off a bit when you raise your arms and bring them down again and that's something I have to figure out. The actual dance moves are a little simpler but there's a lot of stuff to keep track of as you change zill patterns. The third combo is tough with more traveling steps, changes in the speed of moves, and grapevines with arabesques. The zills change with every segment of the combination. There are four zill patterns.  The fourth and final uses Arabic walks, pivots, eights, hip drops, turns, a spot of choo choo shimmy, and chasse. It's a long combo with lots and lots to do. I think it has 5 or 6 zill pattern changes. Phew.

The combinations give way to the grapevine drill from Michelle's earlier video, drills Drills Drills (highly recommended). This, as I mentioned, would be a good one to do before the combinations. It's a brilliant layering drill in itself.
I've no doubt that I'd select this video to learn zill playing. I'm instantly comfortable with it. If I find I can't do the combinations with zills at first, I may drill with components of those combinations (like a step-touch travel step). I also really look forward to learning the combinations and using them elsewhere. They're very much the sort you can use and are very versatile.

This video has been received very well by the belly dance video group of which I am a member. Almost everyone loves it. Only those who've used other methods altogether find it difficult to switch. Some of the suggestions are that the pattern-tapping breakdown section should include a with-music section. Another is that there should be an explanation of how the pattern count fits into the rhythm's own count and how it relates to the dooms and teks. Frankly, I feel this bit would confuse me thoroughly, so I'm glad it isn't there.

Overall, Killer Ziller is an excellent video. Direct, un-confusing, easy to work with.",1223769600,26,6535,4.699563318777293
3588506,5,B001FSHM70,"I have another of Michelle's DVD's and was leaping for joy when this one was released

Since I have very little zill experience, I was overjoyed at the material and Michelle's method for adding more to your zill repertoire.  Each pattern she explains also has a separate and accompanying session done with an over the shoulder view of of her hands, the pattern, and a notion of what music you are using.  I liked this approach as I could step away to practice and then come back, selecting that part of the video that I wanted to concentrate on first.

There is a wealth of variation here for anyone who is tired of the same triples and tapping out a Baladi.  The choreographed sequence at the end helps you get an idea of the movement and how changing up the patterns can mesh to enhance a dance.",1223769600,10,797,4.394557823129252
3588507,5,B001FSHM70,"Unless your already a 5 star finger cymbal player you will most likely benefit from this dvd.  Michelle goes over how to select, wear, strike, and various ways to play your cymbals, then she instructs you through a good number of finger cymbal patterns, that will go with 4/4 rhythms.  She includes zill instruction for the chiftitelli, and karshlimar rhythms.

The zill drills will help you master each pattern instructed and  following rhythms.  The dance combinations can be used with or without your zills, however adding the zills adds a whole new dimension to your dance.  The movements are nicely varied, between traveling steps and isolations.  I really like the chaptering in this dvd, it will be a great time saver once you've matered the combos, to be able to skip right over the instructional sections and go directly to the practice tab.

The instructional section is a bit more than an hour in length.  The material would be suitable for beginner to more advanced persons studying belly dance.",1223251200,12,1007,4.911242603550296

Not until someone explains it in the way that works for you. This DVD has all the most commonly used ways to describe the zill patterns notated so that it the material is accessible to many learning styles.

The DVD has a drill section with visual cues of each of these notations as well as an up-close of hands playing the pattern on the zills. It is just the right amount of information. The music in the backgound doesn't complicate the understanding of the pattern being taught.

This is the most impressive DVD I have seen on the topic. Many teachers have trouble teaching this skill. This is a great DVD for both students and teachers.",1287446400,3,690,4.504

3588511,5,B001FSHM70,"This is a great quality DVD with a great instructor.  I like the way this DVD was formatted into 3 parts - Part 1 is where you learn the basics and the rhythms by tapping the zills against your tummy so you can get a feel for the patterns.  Part 2 is drilling the cymbals and part 3 is dancing with the cymbals.  Once I got the hang of it, I just skip Part 1 and go directly to Part 2 & 3. In Part 2 - Cymbal Drills - you see a close up shot of her hands and the number patterns on screen.  This makes it very easy to follow along.  I'm glad I'm right handed.  I would have like to know the names of the patterns for some of the rhythms, though.  For example, is there a name for the 3-5-5 or 3-7-3 pattern? But overall, this is an excellent DVD that will surely enhance your dancing with zills.",1275264000,3,795,3.8703703703703702
3588512,5,B001FSHM70,"I just received this dvd this past weekend and it is well worth the purchase. If you have not played zills before, or have trouble doing so while dancing like me, then this will be of great help in that particular ambition. The zill patterns in this are actually very simple to master by themselves be honest, but the difficulty comes when combining those patterns with the dance steps so don't let the simplicity fool you. At first I thought it might be better if they had included more of the actual arabic patterns for this, but in retrospect it's probably better that they were not as playing the zills themselves while dancing is challenge enough. To have included more arabic rythms would not really have served the purpose of this dvd, which is to provide drills to practice so that playing zills while dancing becomes second nature.

The actual dance combos taught on this are maybe of intermediate level in difficulty, not beginner but not advanced either, but they become much harder once you add zill patterns. Still, they are a great way to get used to playing zills. Also of great use is the section on drilling, a 20 minute continues drill that plays all the rythms taught over and over, great for stamina and developing dexterity and timing with the zills.

Now, all that said, there are other dvd's out there which teach the zills as a instrument, not just to be played while dancing. Of particular note is Zill Drills with Susu Pampanin and Zaina Zahesha, which is absolutely wonderful for learning the arabic rythms, and covers all the one's you would need to know for the dance and then some. A dvd to perhaps consider after this one if you wish to take your zill playing to the next level, but even if not then killer ziller will make you a much better zill player on it's own.",1271030400,2,1797,4.560371517027864
3588513,4,B001FSHM70,"I am enjoying this video.

3588514,5,B001FSHM70,"I think the title ""Killer Ziller"" definitely implies that this is an intermediate/advanced zil DVD.  The drills were intermediate to an advanced level, not really for beginners.

This is why I gave it only 3 stars. I hoped to find some easy and very motivating sections for beginners like those that the dancer Anthea (Kawakib) uses.
I think this DVD is good for (intermediate) dancers who already use zills a bit and need some ideas to vary the patterns and dance combinations.",1257033600,15,452,4.392857142857143
3588516,5,B001FSHM70,"If you want a DVD to teach you drills for zilling, than this is it. It's set up great, and the chapter set-up is really nice if you want to repeat sections over since each rhythm is it's own chapter. You can set your DVD player to repeat on that chapter if you want.
I wouldn't get this if you are a beginner on the basic steps of bellydance because she doesn't go over that unless it's from another drill that she's done on another DVD, but then, that isn't the goal of this DVD. If you are familiar with them, then go for it! It's improved my movement while playing zills at least ten-fold.
It's a fantastic DVD, and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves bellydance. It's organized very well, and Michelle Joyce is a great dancer and is very clear when explaining what you're doing.
