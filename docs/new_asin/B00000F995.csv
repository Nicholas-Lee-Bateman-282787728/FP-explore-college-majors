7907191,5,B00000F995,I have used this Garman Street Pilot GPS extensively.  On trips with the motor home.  On trips where I  flew and took this GPS with me and used it to drive home.  It is my easiest to use and the most dependable.  over many years and miles of using it I highly recommend this Garman model 7200 GPS to everyone.  Its the very best and available from Amazon.,1370822400,,355,4.147058823529412
