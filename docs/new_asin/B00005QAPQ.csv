Got this DVD not knowing that the other feature is an part of Ed Wood's filmography. About what I expected. More fun Poverty Row filmmaking.",1488412800,,322,4.551724137931035

7950010,3,B00005QAPQ,"The double feature DVD of The Black Cat and The Fat Black Pussycat is not without its charms. Both are low budget features, though The Black Cat appears to be a ""no budget"" independent. The acting is borderline atrocious while the sound recording is poor, making it difficult to understand much of the dialog. I saw this film as an 11 year old in a local theatre and at the time it scared the crap out of me. Seen today, the film's special effects are crude though the gruesome nature of the story is still unnerving. The accompanying feature, The Fat Black Pussycat, is much more entertaining, though there are ludicrous plot holes and some badly staged scenes that might make Ed Wood wince. The acting, however, helps paper over many of these flaws, allowing the viewer to more fully enjoy the film as a whole. Together the two Cat flicks make for a nice cheesy double feature experience.",1281571200,,890,4.60377358490566
7950011,3,B00005QAPQ,"THE FAT BLACK PUSSYCAT - Ed Wood production values and nonsensical screenplay make this film ripe for the trash heap but the overall experience does have some merit.  The camp value of Greenwich Village bohemia makes this quite watchable if you like watching that scene (I do).  In between the stereotypes there are one or two genuine moments of Village life and uh, village people (no pun intended, the film is gratuitously homophobic).  The agenda is obviously anti-beatnik, but like many of the anti-Hippie films that will soon follow, the 'normal' protagonist doesn't mind dipping his own 'big toe' in their lifestyle, so to speak!  And most of the cops in this film make Jack Webb seem like Marlon Brando.  There's some humor that works, like a middle-aged cop reciting beat poetry by reading his police handbook with the word ""man"" at the end of each sentence.  Also, the sex and violence in this film was pretty cool and pretty racy for its day (check out the deleted scenes for even more 'shocking' footage).  One gets the feeling that somewhere beneath the idiotic plot and annoying cat there might have been a good movie here, but one would have to dig pretty deep.  Okay, very deep.  It's essentially a crappy movie but there is some reward in sitting through this. Look closely and you'll find a few famous faces when they were still unknowns, like Hugh Romney (soon to become 'Wavy Gravy' of Woodstock fame), Leonard Frey (Boys in the Band and Fiddler on the Roof), and in the deleted scenes, Hector Elizando (billed as Hector Elizanda).  Perhaps I'm being too kind to this flick, but the other flick on the DVD [THE BLACK CAT] was such a dreadful bore (basically a 10-minute Twilight Zone with 60 minutes of B movie padding); that TFBP seemed brilliant in comparison.  The extras on the DVD are sparse in quantity but make up for it in quality: the trailers are worth searching out, and beefy stripper Margie La Mont has stolen my heart - or my stomach anyway. BLEH!!!",1104451200,4,1982,4.699421965317919
7950012,3,B00005QAPQ,"THE BLACK CAT is a fine piece of regional, shot-in-Texas schlock a la S.F. Brownrigg and Larry Buchanan. Terribly acted, it still has the lonely, off-kilter atmosphere that only a lack of budget and talent can provide. I took points off for FAT, BLACK PUSSYCAT, a wretched murder mystery that distributors liberally re-edited in order to get playdates. A bomb in every department.",1037318400,4,380,5.0476190476190474
7950013,4,B00005QAPQ,"I give ""The Black Cat"" 3 stars and ""Fat Black Pussycat"" 4 stars.
The ""Black Cat"" is another run of the mill Poe adaptation set in more modern times.  The only really interesting thing in this barely adequate time-waster is the jazzy lounge club where the lead male hangs out.  Groovey.
""The Fat Black Pussycat"" is the name of another interesting (and real) club, which is the real subject of the second feature. Originally, FBP was a lightly comic murder yarn which, taking place mostly at a beat club, was largely an excuse to poke fun at the beats and didn't involve any real cats or much of a mystery story.  If you watch the deleted scenes while watching the full movie, you get a good idea of what the original film was like (nice light fun).  If made in England, it would have easily fit into the ""Carry On"" series.  However, due to the apparent lack of commerciality of the film (I guess people expecting to see a mystery would be disappointed that the killer revealed at the end is someone not seen previously in the film) it was greatly altered with the addition of new scenes.  Now, there is a cat with a psychic connection to the killer, a copycat killer, and new beats who are given bigger roles.  The new scenes don't even try to match the scenery of the original film.  There is one scene of a police commissioner hanging out with two women which didn't make any sense to me until I realized he was supposed to be at the same club at the same time as the detectives.  Also, the shocking surprise ending doesn't make any sense until you realize that two of the people in it are supposed to be the main stars seen throughout the movie, only they're played by two people who look nothing like the original stars!  The female actually looks far more like one of the murder victims, who, like the female in this last scene, was also doing sociological research on beatniks, which made it especially confusing to me at first.  And the TV reporter in the new scenes keeps getting everyone's names wrong.
The alterations almost reach Ed Wood level in their ineptitude, and the new storyline makes absolutely no sense!  For example, how does the forensic psychologist know that the killer is either gay or lesbian, BUT only when committing murders, AND has a psychic connection to a cat, all just from looking at a female murder victim with missing shoes!?!? Fun, fascinating stuff.
Beyond the deleted scenes, this one is short on extras, but the trailers are great.",1037145600,5,2471,4.553047404063205
7950014,3,B00005QAPQ,"Any young American male who grew up reading the old ""Famous Monsters Of Filmland"" magazine will be familiar with the images of the black cat astride the blond woman's bloody head! This is that film, everyone...THE BLACK CAT. Atrocious acting, sets and bimbos abound in this grade Z film that will undoubtedly keep you mesmerized. Based on Poe's tale, ""The Black Cat"", it was more successfully filmed with Vincent Price, Joyce Jameson and Peter Lorre in the trilogy ""Tales Of Terror"", another film I recommend. But this '66 version is still enjoyable for bringing it into the 20th century. Plot: wacko kills his wife, bricks up her body behind a basement wall until his deed is given away by.....?
THE FAT BLACK PUSSYCAT is a '63 film that features beatniks (is Wavy Gravy that young man in the crowd?), a maniacal killer, a cop who falls for a slut and a cafe' called The Fat Black Pussycat. This ain't a horror film as is THE BLACK CAT, it's just a murder mystery but still entertaining for it's cheapness with 45 minutes of deleted scenes; this borders on soft-soft-soft porn: the intentions are there and so are the clothes! If you are a connoisseur of b-films, or just a glutton for punishment, this is one DVD you need for your collection.",1012608000,6,1244,4.659090909090909
7950015,3,B00005QAPQ,"I saw The Black Cat when it was first released in 1966.  It is the only movie I ever walked out of because I was so afraid.  Ever since that time, I have looked for some mention of this movie and found nothing.  Of all the movie-review guides published, no information could be found.  I could never find it on videotape.  It was never shown on TV.  I began to think that I had imagined seeing it all those years ago; it was as if the movie did not exist.  Earlier this year, I finally obtained a bootleg VHS copy.  Sadly, the film was not as scary as it was 35 years ago (what film is?).  Also, the acting was atrocious, and to call it low budget would be a compliment.  However, the shocking scenes that I recalled were still shocking.  The bottom line - even though it is not a professionally made product, it has scenes of such power to shock that it is worth seeing; even worth having.  I will warn you though - do not watch it if you do not like to see animals treated cruelly.  What took so long to release this rarity on DVD?",1008720000,4,1033,4.105
