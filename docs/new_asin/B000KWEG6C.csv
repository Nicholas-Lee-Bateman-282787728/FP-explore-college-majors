2697710,5,B000KWEG6C,"Season three IS Red v/s Blue!  Season Three has the most content of any season collection; and introduces, establishes, or develops most of the character biographies and locations used in the initial series (the first 5 seasons).  It's almost more than you can absorb in one sitting.
You will be talking about the CTF (capture the flag) scenes for MONTHS; the ""one liners"" from this segment will become part of your vocabulary and invade gaming culture for decades.
...and ""Camping"" IS a legitimate strategy.",1276041600,2,508,5.035714285714286
2697711,5,B000KWEG6C,"Season Three is over two hours of action packed, plot twisted, character driven mystery, adventure, time travel, explosions, talking bombs, robot armies, and lots of dead people.  Tons of extras, such as deleted scenes, outtakes, a audio commentary and a Easter egg.  Of course, there is adult language and jokes, even in the commentary and this is not for little kids, babies, pets, people with heart problems and, no matter what they tell you, don't watch after getting drunk.

2697722,4,B000KWEG6C,I can't see this being everyone's cup of tea but despite its 'pac-man' like crude animation and graphics  it does have a strange appeal. Strong characters and a wacky plot line keep viewers guessing what will happen next. There is a dream like quality that suspends logic.

It's like something someone would post on YouTube after their first semester of a video animation class. I honestly can't even believe Amazon would air it. To make things even worse, there about a dozen of these things on here. I select action genre & it's flooded with these ""films"". Actually, I wouldn't even call them films, they're just pure junk, almost like spam, they just clutter up your genre selection.

2697739,5,B000KWEG6C,"Red vs. Blue is a Machinima comedy series based on the XBox game Halo.

The series takes place on an alien planet, where two armies, (Red Team and Blue Team), are at war with each other in the middle of a box canyon, (Blood Gulch). Although there isn't a lot of fighting, there is a lot of humorous bickering.

I had the pleasure of viewing all 100+ episodes and spoof Public Service Announcements created by Rooster Teeth Productions. The writing and humor is BRILLIANT. The characters are well-developed and have their own distinct personalities.

If you're looking for a good laugh and a lot of memorable quotes, I highly recommended watching this series on DVD. This is easily the most hilarious thing that has come from the internet.",1411516800,,738,4.75

(In order,) I laughed a few times so hard, I thought I would have to go pee! (whoop's, te he, he.) They kept getting more outrageous as the Volumes kept getting higher. :) Just to share a fact, we ""Gamers"" actually do talk/speak out story plots like these at times, just to keep these games interesting...",1407456000,,468,4.043010752688172

2697745,4,B000KWEG6C,I love this whole series but I have one complaint about this season/Volume 3. That is not the right voice for Caboose. It's close but just far enough off to make it irritating.,1405728000,,176,4.363636363636363
2697746,5,B000KWEG6C,Hilarious!  Great for any Halo lover as long as you get the snarky tongue and cheek nature of the show.,1404432000,,103,4.15
2697747,5,B000KWEG6C,Absolutely hilarious. My favorite season of RVB so far! Its well written and extremely clever. The voice acting is great!,1401235200,,121,5.1

2697750,1,B000KWEG6C,I would not request this to any gamer or fan of gaming. It is lame and not worth the time to even watch ten minutes of it.,1394841600,,122,3.5555555555555554

2697759,5,B000KWEG6C,"This show is great! I cannot get enough of them.

A bunch of rag-tag soldiers going on irrelevant missions that get sucked into a huge conspiracy, get transported into the future, and end up saving civilization.  Definitely not for kids though.

2697770,4,B000KWEG6C,Fun series. I just wish the language was toned down. If the language wasn't so rough I would give it 5 stars.,1362009600,,109,4.0
2697771,5,B000KWEG6C,"The red vs blue series is quite funny. Example: One Red Team Spartan gets to pick his own color armor, so he picks light red.  When he gets back to the Team the guys all tell him he picked out Pink.  Then there's Caboose and his famous Caboose-isms. Aside from cussing, this is a funny series about two adversaries that prefer to goof-off than fight.",1361491200,,350,4.369230769230769

8159161,5,B000KWEG6C,"Love this series. It's all good but it really hits it's stride in Volume 3. A lot of the humour comes from seeing Halo guys interact like regular guys, but the writing is tight and the comedic timing is great.

8159164,5,B000KWEG6C,"Season three--the mayhem and madcap comedy parade continues, as we follow the antics of red/blue, Lopez and Sheila, the mad AI who took over the pacifist doctor and more. The segment directly following the huger explosion dealing with time was stellar--pun intended :-). The addition of random red/blue guys, multiple teleporters, all manner of dead people becoming not dead and vice versa was extremely well conceived, and well scripted. The multiple time hopping Churches and Gary had even my other half (who doesn't find these nearly as funny as I do) laughing pretty hard. I would love to know how the writers conceive of some of these ideas--as a writer myself, I envy them their talent when it comes to true satire--a talent that is becoming rare.

As always the look of the season was vintage Halo, a look that suits the subject matter perfectly--and having the Church 1800+ years in the past done in an entirely retro arcade style was a perfect added touch that means so much, so to speak. As always, the Sarge and his never ending persecution of Riff was worth more than a few belly laughs, as were Lopez's Head's remarks (yes, Lopez is body-less at the moment, long story).

When I told me two sons (25 and 26) I was watching this series, they were shocked--I have no idea why, as I have always watched them play Halo and other games. I was surprised because my older son thinks this series is sheer genius, and my younger one rates it a 3 at best. After asking a bunch of other people in their age group how THEY feel about this series, it seems that you have to be able to identify and appreciate a certain type of humor to ""get"" this. I can say that of everyone I asked who has watched at least one season, The people who ""get"" this series all like Monty Python and Harry Harrison also--whereas everyone who said it was OK or stupid doesn't. Strictly anecdotal observation, but it does point to what perception of humor people who ""get"" this show have--so now I know who to recommend it to.

It's going to be tough to wait a few days to watch the next season....",1437436800,,2075,4.513297872340425
