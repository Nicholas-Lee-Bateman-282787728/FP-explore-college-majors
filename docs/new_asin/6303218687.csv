7840957,5,6303218687,"Baseball - Inning 6, The National Pastime (1940-1950) is by far the longest of the nine inning series. Baseball - Inning 6 is two hours twenty-nine minutes and fifty seconds and was released on September 25, 1994. Inning 6 runs through the years 1941-1949. We begin with Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak and Ted William batting over .400 and we end the series with the death of Babe Ruth. In between the Brooklyn Dodgers become a winning club and go to the World Series twice and loose both times. The All American Girls Professional Baseball League is born. World War II happens and bulks of the best baseball players are drafted or enlist; thereby we get sub-standard players for about four years. Even the worst team in baseball history (the Saint Louis Browns) makes it to the World Series, but loses. Finally baseball becomes a National Pastime when Jackie Robinson becomes the first black player to play in professional league baseball. Inning 6 is broken down into fourteen segments.

7840958,5,6303218687,"This sixth volume in Ken Burns' classic documentary on ""Baseball"" begins with the marvelous summer of 1941, which featured not one but two of the greatest individual achievements in the history of the sport: Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak and Ted Williams batting .406.  But the event that dominates this ""inning,"" and towards which Burns has set his sight since the opening prologue, is Jackie Roosevelt Robinson playing in the major leagues for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942.  By the time we get to this part of the documentary we fully appreciate the social and personal significance of the event for both Robinson and Branch Rickey.  This episode also covers baseball during World War II, including the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, and ends with the death of Babe Ruth, thereby linking the game's two most significant players, the Babe and Jackie Robinson.  Every spring as opening day approaches I take out ""Baseball"" and watch it again.  Just hearing the voice of John Chancellor and watching the film clips of the game's great players is a necessary rite of spring.  ""The National Pastime"" is clearly the climax of the series.",986083200,2,1159,5.041884816753926
