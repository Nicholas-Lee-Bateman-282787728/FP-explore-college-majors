8335267,5,B001Q9SCKY,"This has been a family favorite for months! The little ones never seem to get bored with it, ages ranging from 2 to 10!!!  Our 3 yr old & 8 yr old love showing it to their friends when they come over, as something ""different"" to watch from all the other mainstream stuff out there that all starts to look the same. This is unique, entertaining, informative, and makes a great, innovative  gift for any young ones in your life!  Enjoy!!!",1251676800,,436,4.3580246913580245
8335268,5,B001Q9SCKY,"Wow!  This brand new series hooked the kids because of the children's voices and fun style, and it totally stunned the adults in the room, thanks to the brilliant use of big band, really motivating music and phenomenal camera work.  You won't see anything better on National Geographic.  I'd say this is a MUST HAVE for every family video library.  You can't go wrong showing this to visiting families!  And the conservation message to children is priceless.",1235260800,,458,4.896103896103896
