3107150,4,B0013FZUP6,"Other than being super slow in parts and occasionally predictable, I truly enjoyed this movie as it was a different take on married life in the 1940s. There is mystery, intrigue, deception and infidelity, not to mention that there are a lot of different stereotypes that one normally associates with certain genders that are broken throughout the movie.

Great acting by all cast member... I enjoyed the storyline, costuming and cinematography.",1229212800,7,444,5.253521126760563
3107151,3,B0013FZUP6,"Given the general write-up of this film and some review comments I've seen elsewhere, I expected this film to be some what different than it turned out to be. Perhaps more like one of the alternate endings on the disc, perhaps not.  Regardless, I'd have to say it wasn't exactly what seemed to be promised, but was still interesting to say the least.

Harry (Chris Cooper) is in a loveless marriage (at least from his wife's side) to Pat (Patricia Clarkson), but that isn't a problem as Harry has found the beautiful Kay (Rachel McAdams) and intends to be with her and live happily ever after, if only he can find a way to split with his wife without breaking her heart.  Richard (Pierce Brosnan) knows of Harry and Kay's relationship because he's Harry's best friend and Harry has told him of his desires and his relationship to the lovely Kay.  Unfortunately for Harry, Richard is a ladies man and he just can't let Harry have such a beauty for himself even if he is a best friend.

With that convuluted relationship between the characters, and a few other bumps in the road introduced along the way you'd think that a movie that promises suspense and intrique would perhaps play out in a certain manner.  Ah, but such expectations are not necessarily what you'll get from this film.

Without spoiling the plot, suffice it to say again that what you expect and what you'll get from this film are not necessarily going to agree, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the film.  Not at all.  Do watch the film for the character studies, for the attention to detail on life in the period that is covered, for the relationships and interactions between the characters and oh, yeah, also for the story that is delivered.

The performances from the stars are good.  Chris Cooper does very well here, but if you are familiar with his work you know that could be said of just about any role you find him in.  Brosnan does quite well as a bit of a scoundrel, and Clarkson does quite well in her role here too.  McAdams seems a bit young for someone that would be interested in Cooper's character, but it's quite easy to see why anyone would be interested in and tempted by her.

A quick comment about the film on Blu-ray: my own take on the picture quality here is that the transfer is soft and not as sharp or well defined as one might expect on high-def media.  I have not seen this film in theatres so I can't say for sure that this wasn't the look that the director was going for, but I'd expect that there'd be more details in the faces of the stars here and unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Images in the background were somewhat blurred and easily lost and that normally isn't the case with most content on Blu-ray or seen in high definition.

I've rated this one a middle of the road 3 stars.  Some may find it closer to 5 star material, while others wonder what was the point and where did the 90 minutes (give or take) that they used to watch the film go.  Again, not necessarily something that would seem to have a big following, and much more likely to be a film that is somewhat quickly watched and forgotten.  Of course that's just my own opinion, and yours may be different.  If so, please feel free to leave a comment or write your own review here to help others that may be interested in seeing this film but would like more information and opinions before doing so.",1220918400,2,3384,4.44336569579288
3107152,3,B0013FZUP6,"I rented this on a whim, in part because I'd read that it resembles a Hitchcock movie. It doesn't, really, but it's a decent little drama that captures the look and feel of a bygone era almost perfectly.  It's not really a thriller, or a comedy, or even a heavyweight drama. It's more of a character study, with a couple of suspenseful scenes along the way. I enjoyed it, but it's pretty forgettable. This movie reminded me in some ways of Todd Haynes' ""Far from Heaven.""  If you liked that, you'll probably like ""Married Life,"" and vice-versa.",1220572800,4,544,4.597938144329897
3107153,3,B0013FZUP6,"Not since `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pleasantville-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/6305308659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pleasantville (New Line Platinum Series)</a>' or `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quiz-Show/dp/6305428522/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quiz Show</a>' has a movie in recent memory captured the vintage setting in the middle of the last century so well. Every piece of furniture, every outfit, every office dcor points to the year 1949 in `Married Life,' but it's really the feel and emotional tone that imprint this old-fashioned noir so well. If they didn't speak so frankly about sex, it could have been a dead ringer original from its period.

Pierce Brosnan is no Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart, but he's suave enough to narrate the story. From an opening restaurant scene Harry Allen (Chris Cooper) lays bare to childhood friend Richard Lindley (Brosnan) his desire to leave his wife in favor of his mistress Kay (Rachel McAdams). As they have drinks, Richard shares his belief that he and his wife were really close. During the same restaurant scene, however, he's immediately taken by Kay whom he meets with Harry for the first time.

At home Harry's wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B0014D5RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>') shows how untraditional the film can be in places. ""Sex is love,"" she tells her unresponsive husband. Hardly bending to her needs and desires, Harry has already shared with Richard that his preference for Kay is based on romance rather than libido.

Richard maneuvers to steal Kay from Harry while Harry tries to find a way to kill his wife ""to save her from suffering"" a breakup. On the surface Richard is solicitous in helping everyone involved; below the surface only he can tell the whole story of lives where ""it's hard to build your happiness on the unhappiness of others--not with [their] burden of conscience.""

`Married Life' is not as ironic as it wants to be, but it's emotionally solid enough to be a good new old movie experience. Cooper's core performance is central to that movie's emotion as well as some of its suspense. He's already proven himself in movies like `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breach/dp/B0017R1E78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breach</a>' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000F7CMRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana (Full Screen Edition)</a>,' but here he's a natural in a more vulnerable role. McAdams platinum blonde bombshell character may have us checking our calendar watches as she glamorously fills up the screen like Grace Kelly or Eva Gardner. As already mentioned, Pierce Brosnan is a natural match for his slightly tilted hat. And Patricia Clarkson adds much subletly as Harry's secretly conflicted wife.

There are definite drawbacks as well: The build up of the movie to the denouement mainly makes the whole affair go from sizzle to fizzle. While the impact of 'Married Life' may not always be a big wallop, this transporting film with its quietly engaging performances are definitely a draw. If it does nothing else, it will remind you that they don't make 'em like they used to.

3107154,4,B0013FZUP6,"MARRIED LIFE will probably fare better in the DVD format where this at times disturbing view of marital status can be viewed in private rather than in the company of the throngs that resemble the characters depicted in this fine little film. Based on the novel 'Five Roundabouts to Heaven' by John Bingham and well adapted to the screen by Oren Moverman and director Ira Sachs, MARRIED LIFE is a dissection of the hallowed state of matrimony, and one that shows the creases and little holes that make so many marriages fail.  it is set in the late 1940s, likely with the attempt to give some 'distance' to the plot, but the messages remain in comparing the tale to contemporary times.

Narrated by perennial playboy bachelor Richard Langley (Pierce Brosnan), we are introduced to Harry Allen (Chris Cooper) who apparently has it all - big house, great job, sex-driven wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson), country home - but Harry has fallen in love with military widow  Kay Nesbitt (Rachel McAdams).  Harry respects and still 'loves' Pat, but finds in Kay the love he has felt missing from his marriage.  He confides his desire to leave Pat to Richard who is surprised - until Richard meets the beautiful Kay.  Not wanting to hurt Pat, Harry decides the only solution is to murder Pat so that he can then marry Kay: he researches poisons and buys a potion that he plans to place in Pat's ever-present 'digestive medicine' bottle.  Harry and Kay continue their secret assignations in both Kay's home and Harry's nearby country home, but things begin to muddle as Richard falls for Kay, and Kay's attention shifts to Richard, and the devoted Pat is hiding her secret lover Tom (David Richmond-Peck).  As the twists and turns surface, everything unwinds and the ending of the story comes as a surprise to everyone!

The quartet of actors - Clarkson, Cooper, Brosnan, and McAdams - serve the story well and the flavor of the 1940s starts with superb opening credit images and carries through with the fine decors and attention to detail that don't seem to miss a beat in recreating the period.  This is a difficult film to classify - it has comedy inherent in the absurdity of portions of the plot, it has drama in the core of the tale, and it has mystery as the surprises keep surfacing.  The overall effect will be different for every viewer, depending on where in the marriage spectrum each viewer stands!  Grady Harp, September 08",1220400000,19,2423,4.742857142857143
3107155,4,B0013FZUP6,"A Pierce Brosnan narrated period piece about love, marriage and in the end - friendship. I will preface this with a disclaimer - the high rating and bit about friendship is for the alternate versions of this film.

The quality of the transfer looked very good, and I think when they make heavy make-up films like this the standards have to be higher now. Making it look flawless on such beauties as McAdams and an aged Brosnan and Cooper (alternates) can be tough, but they pulled it off decently. The clarity was so good at times there were a few reflections of cameras, lights and boom mics in glasses, eyes, etc. The story was made to be very believable for the time period, but I have to give the kudos to Cooper for once again playing a great role.

But what makes this film is the alternate endings. DRASTICALLY different then what you saw in theaters and on the home release. The special features on the Blu are the same as on the DVD, so buying this Blu would be recommended for the period piece memorabilia clarity alone. Plus, the other endings showed as 1080 even though it says 480 on the box (and most alternate inclusions are lodef on Blu so that was nice). I wish there was a way to bookmark the film and splice in the much better ending(s). Rex Reed keeps getting quoted as saying this is humorous and funny but I would say expect more of a ""simmering"" slowly played film that has some fun scenes and maybe one or two themes of darkness, but is believably enjoyable. The alternate endings total about 20 more minutes and are worth the time investment.",1220140800,12,1567,4.456445993031359

3107157,3,B0013FZUP6,"In all of the press I have seen, in all of the interviews I have watched, everyone mentions how ""slyly funny"", how ""darkly humorous"" the new film ""Married Life"" is. The joke must have gone over my head.

Richard Langley (Pierce Brosnan) tells us the story of his great friend, Harry (Chris Cooper). Harry, a successful businessman in New York, circa 1949, has a loving, even doting wife, Pat (Patricia Clarkson). But he has fallen in love with a beautiful young widow, Kay (Rachel McAdams, ""Red Eye"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Notebook""). Rather than put his wife through the humiliation of a divorce, of leaving her, he decides to poison her. Then, a free man, he can move on and marry Kay. But Harry makes one mistake; he introduces Kay to his great friend, Richard, a lothario like no other, and he is also attracted to Kay.

Directed and co-written by Ira Sachs, ""Married Life"" is a very believable look at the way people lived in the late 40s. The attention to detail is astonishing; clothing, furniture, cars all appear authentic. In one scene, they visit a movie theater and watch a lesser known Ava Gardner film. It's a nice touch. So often in films set in the past, they go to the theater to see ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"". Sure, these are extremely memorable films, but they weren't the only three films made pre 1960.

The four leads are all very good, all very believable. Pierce Brosnan's Richard narrates the film, introducing us to the characters, to the story and guides us throughout. He speaks in a softly modulated tone, giving the film the feeling of a fable or a fairy tale. His voice, complete with Irish accent, lulls us into the story, slowly helping us get acclimated to this world. Richard is a cad, but he is a bachelor, so we can't hate him too much when we learn he sleeps around. By the time we realize he is going to try to seduce Kay away from his good friend, Harry, his behavior has become well enough established that we would be disappointed if he didn't try to sleep with the young woman.

Chris Cooper is great as Harry; there are a lot of layers to his character and they are revealed in subtle ways, giving us a great look at his character. Why would Harry think it is more desirable to kill his wife than to divorce her? In his own twisted way, this shows the depth of care he has for her. They have been together for so long, they know each other so well, and he can't fathom the thought of divorcing her. But he also realizes he doesn't love Pat anymore. His passion lies with Kay and he has had a life so devoid of passion for so long, he simply can't let it happen any longer. He needs passion, he needs Kay.

Harry clearly recognizes he has limited resources for making this happen. It has to be something that looks like an accident, or natural. He could never shoot her, or use a knife, too messy and too many bad consequences. So he decides to put poison in her medicine; Pat suffers from ulcers and heart burn so she always has a blue bottle around. As Harry sets about the task at hand, the story takes on decidedly Hitchcockian overtones. Much like ""Suspicion"" and ""Notorious"", we know more than some of the characters and this creates an additional level of suspense. Add the tongue in cheek element, and the film becomes more like Hitchcock's ""The Trouble with Harry"" or ""Family Plot"". At one point, Harry, thinking he has made a terrible mistake, races home to prevent Pat from taking an additional dose of the poison. The film presents all of these elements well, blending them deftly and creating a nice homage to these films, and this era. Cooper is also able to portray the various emotions Harry experiences, sometimes on the turn of a dime, making his character complex and believable.

Patricia Clarkson is perhaps the perfect type to play a housewife from the late forties; she just looks like she fits into this different era and might have walked out of a Norman Rockwell painting. She is also the perfect compliment to Cooper, matching his acting style to a tee. They are both very low key, very natural, and seem to be a real couple.

It is also interesting to watch Clarkson play this character as she has to walk a fine line. One the one hand, we know she is being poisoned, know she is essentially a victim, but she maintains a sunny disposition and manages to make the character seem interesting and viable, and not the least bit pathetic. Basically, she makes a character that seems very simple, someone we have figured out, and still manages to surprise us. The fact that she knows Harry doesn't love her anymore, she states as much, and stays in the relationship, provides an example of her dedication. Too bad she isn't as aware of what her husband is up to.

Rachel McAdams has been off screen for a couple of years and her portrayal of Kay only serves to make this absence all the more noticeable. Much like Clarkson, McAdams takes a character that we probably have `figured out' from the first moment we see her, and makes us feel differently about the woman. Yes, she is an adulterer, but as we get to know her, we realize there is a lot more to her. Her character becomes flesh and blood to us and we learn she is a real human being. This is Sach's best contribution to the story and the characters; details. We learn a lot about each person through observation, comments, actions.

It becomes a little more problematic when she starts to fall for Rich. She is already an adulterer and now she is cheating on the man who is cheating on his wife. But McAdams is able to convey this conflict well, giving us real insight into her character, making us appreciate this decision as well.

It sure seems like I liked ""Married Life"" and I did like many things about it. Perhaps if people weren't so intent on talking about the `dark comedy' aspect of it, I would be more appreciative. It is a very good drama, but the comedy, dark or otherwise, is almost non-existent. Even the moment when Harry rushes home to prevent Pat from taking a dose of the medicine is played more for suspense - I suspect Sachs intended this to be a humorous moment. So, ""Married Life"" isn't funny, except for the occasional mildly amusing moment. In a black comedy, I expect some outright laughs, more amusing moments, and these don't happen.

""Married Life"" is a good film, but it needs a divorce from the plugs it has been getting from the cast in recent interviews and press. Actually a divorce might just be too humiliating. These untrue rumors should probably be put to rest.",1205884800,17,6553,4.521518987341772

I genuinely think I would not be too generous if I gave it 4 out of 5 which is what it deserves to be given considering the excellent performances of each actor that plays in this movie. As far as the slowness of the pace, that is exactly where its unusual appealing lies in my opinion. As many of you I found it hard to get used to as well in the beginning, yet as the movie progessed it got easier to see the reason why it was made so. However, there is one rather overlooked point I'd like to mention as a righteous man briefly. It is about the way Harry is treated by his best friend Richard in the movie. I haven't seen in any of the reviews I have read a mentinoning about Richard's double backstab damage on his extremely decent friend. This has had indeed a stomach-turning effect on me during the movie. Harry who shares every little private detail in his life with Richard is oblivious of the fact that he is being taken advantage of by the one whom he expects to get some help from to make things right. Richard both sanctions Harry's wife gross action of cheating on him at their own house and as if that is not enough of a betrayal, proceeds to steal Harry's new-found oasis of peace in life. Is not a best friend supposed to stand right by your side particularly when you cordially share your deepest feelings and unsureness as to the state of your marriage or any kind of relationship in your tough days?Not to mention the scene where Harry catches Richard with his girlfriend when he unexpectedly rushes into the house to tell Kay to return him all the letters he had written for her in the course of their relatioship. His response in that scene had indeed a kind of temporary paralyzing effect on me. He is way too considerate to say the things he says there. That surely is not how a real man in love responds to a double backstab. What this movie teaches is that matters of heart, no matter how challenging they might seem at times ought to be always handled by you if you don't want to invite more trouble into your relationship than it already has.",1342483200,,2359,4.315315315315315

3107219,3,B0013FZUP6,"Based on the 1953 novel ""Five Roundabouts to Heaven"" by John Bigham, ""Married Life"" - co-written by Oren Moverman and Ira Sachs, and directed by Sachs - is a throwback to all those florid film noir melodramas in which a bored husband (Chris Cooper) plots to do away with his wife (Patricia Clarkson) so he can start a life with his mistress, a leggy, blonde widow (Rachel McAdams) whose husband died in the war.  Pierce Brosnan plays Cooper's best friend, a womanizing bachelor who, naturally, falls in love with the mistress, and who provides the overly-sincere, laughably self-conscious narration for the tale.

Though this kind of thing's been done much better in other films (""Double Indemnity,"" ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and ""How to Murder Your Wife"" spring immediately to mind), solid performances from an A-list cast, rich period detail (the movie is set in 1949), and an interesting subtext about marriage meaning different things to different people ultimately make it palatable.",1294963200,,995,5.135802469135802

Instead, Sachs, along with co-writer Oren Moverman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Messenger/dp/B002VECM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Messenger</a>), downplays the overripe theatrics in favor of a more Hitchcockian approach to their noirish fable about the transient rules of love and deception. The resulting film is fun to watch due to its faithful period depiction but sometimes little more than a moral exercise in punishing the subversive thoughts and actions of the seemingly staid protagonist.

It's 1949, and the plot centers on Harry, a middle-aged and very married Manhattan executive, who finds himself in love with the much younger Kay, a WWII widow who enjoys the attention of a man so devoted to her. Harry decides he cannot divorce his wife Pat for fear of breaking her heart. In fact, he thinks it's more charitable to murder her by poisoning her digestive powder which she takes religiously every day. Harry's best friend Richard is aware of Harry's intentions and gets caught in the middle trying to save the marriage while finding himself becoming attracted to Kay as well. Not quite the victim she would seem to be, Pat has secrets of her own, which leads to a roundelay of events befitting the increasingly uneasy blend of treachery and absolution. Sachs capably keeps things afloat even when the suspense factor appears overly muted.

A smart quartet of actors has been cast beginning with Chris Cooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adaptation/dp/B00005JLRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adaptation</a>) effectively embodying the crushed soul that Harry has become. Providing the voiceover narration from his character's limited perspective, Pierce Brosnan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matador/dp/B000EQ5UIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matador</a>) uses his naturally erudite manner to great wry effect as Richard, while Patricia Clarkson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whatever-Works/dp/B002LMV7RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whatever Works</a>) gives added dimensions of knowingness and cunning to Pat. With her hair dyed an unflattering peroxide blonde, Rachel McAdams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook/dp/B000683VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook</a>) looks poised to play the femme fatale, but her character is more ingenuous than she looks. That basically means McAdams has little bandwidth to add any complex shading to Kay. The 2008 DVD offers an informative commentary from Sachs, the theatrical trailer, and three alternate endings, each flash-forwarding the story sixteen years later to O. Henry-type resolutions. While interesting, none really add that much to the ending used in the movie.",1262044800,,3360,6.775462962962963
3107221,3,B0013FZUP6,"""Married Life""is an interesting film, beautifully directed and performed, perhaps a little too larconic at times and with a middle section that lags and sags a bit. Yet it ultimately becomes a different movie at the end, going from a film noir romantic suspense thriller to something a little more akin to something John Irving would have written. I agree it's not a comedy and there are only fleeting moments of ironic humour, but, hey, what about  the alternate endings.??!! Clearly the reason the film is so short (at 87 mins)is that there is a whole final chapter running about 7-8 minutes that the director left on the cutting room floor. We get to see three edits of this final chapter on the DVD and it turns it again into quite a different film. No one else here seems to have commented on these endings and I would love to know what people thought, personally I rather liked the melancholic stroll through time feel these gave the film and feel there is an even better film lurking in here somewhere. The theatrical version, pleasing enough as it is, is weighed down with too much of an attempt to make it noirish and comical. This could be the story of  a journey through life and its strange and sad ironies.",1255046400,,1219,4.561643835616438
3107222,4,B0013FZUP6,"Married life is a mystery, not only in late 40s, time when the events of this movie take place, but rather since beginning of time.  Pat and Harry have known each other since they were children.  They have been married for a long time.  But perhaps because they know each other so well, their marriage is predictable and tejir interaction civilized.  Without each other knowing about the other, they both have love affairs outside of the mariage.  Pat with a young writer and Harry with a beautiful and lonely war widow.  In spite of being in love with their new love interests, both Pat and Harry are hesitant to divorce each other in fear not to hurt the other emotionally.  So is it better to simply kill off the other person and spare them the pain of humiliation?

As love triangles go and notions of what excitement married life gives, this is one of the most interesting movies I have seen.  The slow pace of the careful storytelling is mesmerizing as we learn about each person's inner battles, desires and motives.",1241654400,2,1023,4.607734806629834
3107223,1,B0013FZUP6,"The story itself is negligible and uninteresting.  For some period pieces, this is not a problem because the visuals or the character studies are the core of the movie.  But here, the visuals were nothing special (other reviewers here disagreed). And the characters were poorly rendered--clearly the fault of the writers, not the actors (who just had nothing to work with).

For example, the dialog _says_ that Richard (Pierce Brosnan) is a womanizer, but what we _see_ is quite different.  There are similar disconnects for all the other characters.

Similarly the (trivial) story arc depends entirely on the voice-over--without it, I would have had a complete different interpretation of events.  Without the audio, I _never_ would have thought that Harry (Chris Cooper) was in love with Kay (McAdams) nor she with him.  Nor would I have suspected that Richard and Harry were more than casual acquaintances.

The sequence where we are waiting to find out whether Harry has murdered his wife is so far beyond over-wrought and over-extended that I became angry at the movie for being so blatant in trying to jerk my emotions around.",1241308800,2,1132,5.048387096774194
3107224,3,B0013FZUP6,"This is a movie about married life in the late 40's.  It shows a married couples' problem in that time period and how leaving your wife or husband was not an option in that era.  Both the husband and wife are not in love anymore and they're both cheating, but they will not ask for a divorce, because they can't bare to see the other person unhappy.  This was true that divorce did not happen in this time period, but I thought the story that the husband would rather see his wife dead than divorce her is crazy.  The movie was suspenseful, but I thought it was unfunny and not that entertaining.  I recommend renting this movie rather than buying, this movie was average.",1237075200,,672,4.387096774193548
3107225,2,B0013FZUP6,"So, truth be told, this cast is very impressive.  Chris Cooper is a very commanding presence who has recently proven his star has yet to fade (watch him work the screen ten times over in `Breach'); Pierce Brosnan is a very charming and infectious actor who knows how to deliver a delicate and nuanced performance (watch him act his butt off in `Evelyn'); Rachel McAdams is one of those actresses to watch out for, working to break out of her teen queen title with interesting choices (watch her steal every ounce of limelight with her Oscar snubbed `Mean Girls' performance); and Patricia Clarkson, I mean really, don't get me started on how amazing she is.  Watch anything she touches and see a screen presence that is beyond words.  Whether she is quietly breaking to pieces (ala `Dogville'), charismatically unraveling (ala `Pieces of April') or weighing in with a delicate bravado (ala `Far From Heaven') she is always a notch above the rest.

So with a cast this impressive this film is bound to be...boring?

I walked into `Married Life' eager to see something amazing and what I got was something I longed to see end.  It was dry, meandering and uninteresting.  It's sad, because the performances by all four actors were very, very good.  In a different movie I'd say that they were all Oscar worthy.  The pacing and mood setting was just too unbearable though, taking away every ounce of life these actors breathed into their characters.

So the film tells of a strange love triangle (or should I say square, or is it a hexagon) that forms between friends.  Harry is married to Pat, and while Harry loves Pat he is `in love' with Kay who is young and vibrant and makes him feel needed.  Harry's best friend is Richard, who upon meeting Kay is instantly smitten.  Richard falls in love with Kay and wants her all to himself, which seems possible beings that Harry is determined not to hurt his wife.  Richard's ideal plan is soon hampered by the unraveling of Pat's dark secret, not to mention the fact that Harry, in an attempt to spare his wife the pain of divorce, has decided to kill her instead.

Yes, there is a lot going on here, and it all sounds so intriguing; but it's not.

It's the pacing that kills this one and it's because of that monotone delivery that I'll never watch it again.  It nearly put me to sleep and it took me two evenings just to get through it, and it wasn't like I started it late in the evening; I simply couldn't watch it any longer.

It was that dull.

I feel bad for the cast and maybe even the screenwriter, who at least attempted to write a tightly woven and interesting marital thriller, but director Ira Sachs (I just noticed that he helped pen this thing too so maybe I don't feel bad for the screenwriter) botches this one up quite a bit.  Like I said, the acting is a saving grace (especially from Clarkson and Cooper) but in the end this marriage is not worth saving.

Oh, and so we are clear, the comparisons to `Mad Men' are quite disturbing beings that the television show is far from boring and unbelievably engrossing; something that this film is far from.",1233100800,3,3111,4.539426523297491
3107226,4,B0013FZUP6,"Name-checking the top grade cast in ""Married Life"" - a sort of 40's/50's film noir tale of marital shenanigans - will be enough to draw most movie lovers in. And while Patricia Clarkson and Rachel McAdams are typically lovely, deep and believable in their roles, it's the two men - Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper - who really get to shine.

Its directed by IRA SACHS and co-adapted by him and ORAN MOVERMAN from the 1953 book by JOHN BINGHAM called ""Five Roundabouts To Heaven"".

Narrated by Richard (Brosnan's character), you just know you're going to enjoy this story when you hear him casually say, ""I always thought marriage was a mild kind of illness...like the Flu or Chicken Pox...to which I was safely immune"". Brosnan's tone throughout the narration changes - at first it's sly and laidback and suave - so you're not sure if he's the good guy or the bad guy - or both - and nor do you want to know - because in this clever and beautifully revealing film, the finding out is half the fun...

And who out there in movie land doesn't want to see a film with Chris Cooper in it? Harry (Cooper's character) is in a stagnating but not entirely loveless marriage to Pat (Clarkson). Then along comes the young, alive and beautiful Kay (McAdams) who stirs Harry's very soul - but alas also grabs the loins of the caddish Richard (Brosnan) - his lifetime buddy and pal. Friendships are tested, plots are formed and everyone drinks loads of scotch and smokes acres of cigarettes and acts as if nothing is wrong...

The boys as you can imagine - given meaty material - are great. Warm, cold, up, down - Cooper layers his performance - and he slyly fools you too by doing so. Brosnan is still great eye-candy and effortlessly charming - caddish one moment - genuine the next - he plays his character both ways - and does it very, very well. McAdams is enough to make most grown men weak at the knees and Patricia Clarkson - who probably has the least likeable of roles - makes you empathize with her character - see her as a real person - a great performance from a genuine class act. In fact, you can 'feel' how all the actors rise to the evolving story - and you suspect they thoroughly enjoyed working off each other while making this intelligently written little gem.

Visually - it's period Americana - were in MAD MEN territory here. ""Married Life"" is gorgeous to look at - and very ""Shawshank"" in places on the outdoor scenes - an absolute blast to view on Blu Ray.

The real unexpected pleasure, however, comes in 3 fully realised Alternate Endings that are almost as enjoyable as the entire movie - and without spoiling it - they take the story to other places - and brilliantly too. Brosnan - in particular - is exceptionally good.

There's a commentary by director and co-script writer Ira Sachs, but it's a damn shame there isn't an on-set segment - because here's actors and a movie you admire - and it would also have been just great to get the writer and director's perspective in interview outside of listening to the entire commentary.

Not a masterpiece for sure, but a great little watch nonetheless and one that deserves your attention.

""Did We Build Our Happiness On The Unhappiness of Others...?"" Brosnan asks towards the end of his voice over - watch this 'classy' little noir thriller to find out...",1232841600,3,3321,4.558724832214765

3107228,4,B0013FZUP6,"The film zips along with its solid script, witty and snappy dialogue and thoughtful and deliciously unpredictable moments. More than once, I was literally at the edge of my seat holding my breath. In 1949, it's a simpler time with diners, luncheons, tea, radio, and dancing on the town or to the picture show as an actual night out. There's something overall romantic about this time. The narration, which I have grown tired of as a plot device (I see it as such a short cut to the main ideas too often), actually works here in adding to the overall nostalgia and quaintness. Many scenes are like Hopper paintings come alive making Married Life a visual treat as well as a compelling film.

The cast is impressive from Pierce Brosnan (The Matador, Die Another Day) to Academy Award winner Chris Cooper (Adaptation, Breach) to indie steady Patricia Clarkson (Lars and the Real Girl). Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, The Notebook) is lovely and so good in these period roles. She looks comfortable and there are layers of sweetness under that platinum hair. Clarkson possesses the right amount of mischief and devotion in her role as the dutiful, seemingly predictable wife. Brosnan is brooding and complex and yummy. I just couldn't buy the Cooper vs. Brosnan though. Hands down I would take a wolf in Brosnan's clothing instead of a sheep like Cooper's character. Cooper/McAdams give the impression of father/daughter more than older man/younger woman. But please don't let that stop you, somehow it all flows along. I suppose that in Harry, a young widow would view safe and secure instead of adventure and excitement in a guy like Rich. The entire cast is so ridiculously talented that you come to like every character in some way.

Married Life is a fantastic film that will seduce you from its first scene to its last.",1231286400,5,1824,4.842948717948718
3341647,4,B0013FZUP6,"Other than being super slow in parts and occasionally predictable, I truly enjoyed this movie as it was a different take on married life in the 1940s. There is mystery, intrigue, deception and infidelity, not to mention that there are a lot of different stereotypes that one normally associates with certain genders that are broken throughout the movie.

Great acting by all cast member... I enjoyed the storyline, costuming and cinematography.",1229212800,7,444,5.253521126760563
3341648,3,B0013FZUP6,"Given the general write-up of this film and some review comments I've seen elsewhere, I expected this film to be some what different than it turned out to be. Perhaps more like one of the alternate endings on the disc, perhaps not.  Regardless, I'd have to say it wasn't exactly what seemed to be promised, but was still interesting to say the least.

Harry (Chris Cooper) is in a loveless marriage (at least from his wife's side) to Pat (Patricia Clarkson), but that isn't a problem as Harry has found the beautiful Kay (Rachel McAdams) and intends to be with her and live happily ever after, if only he can find a way to split with his wife without breaking her heart.  Richard (Pierce Brosnan) knows of Harry and Kay's relationship because he's Harry's best friend and Harry has told him of his desires and his relationship to the lovely Kay.  Unfortunately for Harry, Richard is a ladies man and he just can't let Harry have such a beauty for himself even if he is a best friend.

With that convuluted relationship between the characters, and a few other bumps in the road introduced along the way you'd think that a movie that promises suspense and intrique would perhaps play out in a certain manner.  Ah, but such expectations are not necessarily what you'll get from this film.

Without spoiling the plot, suffice it to say again that what you expect and what you'll get from this film are not necessarily going to agree, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the film.  Not at all.  Do watch the film for the character studies, for the attention to detail on life in the period that is covered, for the relationships and interactions between the characters and oh, yeah, also for the story that is delivered.

The performances from the stars are good.  Chris Cooper does very well here, but if you are familiar with his work you know that could be said of just about any role you find him in.  Brosnan does quite well as a bit of a scoundrel, and Clarkson does quite well in her role here too.  McAdams seems a bit young for someone that would be interested in Cooper's character, but it's quite easy to see why anyone would be interested in and tempted by her.

A quick comment about the film on Blu-ray: my own take on the picture quality here is that the transfer is soft and not as sharp or well defined as one might expect on high-def media.  I have not seen this film in theatres so I can't say for sure that this wasn't the look that the director was going for, but I'd expect that there'd be more details in the faces of the stars here and unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Images in the background were somewhat blurred and easily lost and that normally isn't the case with most content on Blu-ray or seen in high definition.

I've rated this one a middle of the road 3 stars.  Some may find it closer to 5 star material, while others wonder what was the point and where did the 90 minutes (give or take) that they used to watch the film go.  Again, not necessarily something that would seem to have a big following, and much more likely to be a film that is somewhat quickly watched and forgotten.  Of course that's just my own opinion, and yours may be different.  If so, please feel free to leave a comment or write your own review here to help others that may be interested in seeing this film but would like more information and opinions before doing so.",1220918400,2,3384,4.44336569579288
3341649,3,B0013FZUP6,"I rented this on a whim, in part because I'd read that it resembles a Hitchcock movie. It doesn't, really, but it's a decent little drama that captures the look and feel of a bygone era almost perfectly.  It's not really a thriller, or a comedy, or even a heavyweight drama. It's more of a character study, with a couple of suspenseful scenes along the way. I enjoyed it, but it's pretty forgettable. This movie reminded me in some ways of Todd Haynes' ""Far from Heaven.""

Every piece of furniture, every outfit, every office dcor points to the year 1949 in `Married Life,' but it's really the feel and emotional tone that imprint this old-fashioned noir so well. If they didn't speak so frankly about sex, it could have been a dead ringer original from its period.

Pierce Brosnan is no Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart, but he's suave enough to narrate the story. From an opening restaurant scene Harry Allen (Chris Cooper) lays bare to childhood friend Richard Lindley (Brosnan) his desire to leave his wife in favor of his mistress Kay (Rachel McAdams). As they have drinks, Richard shares his belief that he and his wife were really close. During the same restaurant scene, however, he's immediately taken by Kay whom he meets with Harry for the first time.

At home Harry's wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B0014D5RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>') shows how untraditional the film can be in places. ""Sex is love,"" she tells her unresponsive husband. Hardly bending to her needs and desires, Harry has already shared with Richard that his preference for Kay is based on romance rather than libido.

Richard maneuvers to steal Kay from Harry while Harry tries to find a way to kill his wife ""to save her from suffering"" a breakup. On the surface Richard is solicitous in helping everyone involved; below the surface only he can tell the whole story of lives where ""it's hard to build your happiness on the unhappiness of others--not with [their] burden of conscience.""

`Married Life' is not as ironic as it wants to be, but it's emotionally solid enough to be a good new old movie experience. Cooper's core performance is central to that movie's emotion as well as some of its suspense. He's already proven himself in movies like `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breach/dp/B0017R1E78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breach</a>' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000F7CMRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana (Full Screen Edition)</a>,' but here he's a natural in a more vulnerable role. McAdams platinum blonde bombshell character may have us checking our calendar watches as she glamorously fills up the screen like Grace Kelly or Eva Gardner. As already mentioned, Pierce Brosnan is a natural match for his slightly tilted hat. And Patricia Clarkson adds much subletly as Harry's secretly conflicted wife.

There are definite drawbacks as well: The build up of the movie to the denouement mainly makes the whole affair go from sizzle to fizzle. While the impact of 'Married Life' may not always be a big wallop, this transporting film with its quietly engaging performances are definitely a draw. If it does nothing else, it will remind you that they don't make 'em like they used to.

3341651,4,B0013FZUP6,"MARRIED LIFE will probably fare better in the DVD format where this at times disturbing view of marital status can be viewed in private rather than in the company of the throngs that resemble the characters depicted in this fine little film. Based on the novel 'Five Roundabouts to Heaven' by John Bingham and well adapted to the screen by Oren Moverman and director Ira Sachs, MARRIED LIFE is a dissection of the hallowed state of matrimony, and one that shows the creases and little holes that make so many marriages fail.  it is set in the late 1940s, likely with the attempt to give some 'distance' to the plot, but the messages remain in comparing the tale to contemporary times.

Narrated by perennial playboy bachelor Richard Langley (Pierce Brosnan), we are introduced to Harry Allen (Chris Cooper) who apparently has it all - big house, great job, sex-driven wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson), country home - but Harry has fallen in love with military widow  Kay Nesbitt (Rachel McAdams).  Harry respects and still 'loves' Pat, but finds in Kay the love he has felt missing from his marriage.  He confides his desire to leave Pat to Richard who is surprised - until Richard meets the beautiful Kay.  Not wanting to hurt Pat, Harry decides the only solution is to murder Pat so that he can then marry Kay: he researches poisons and buys a potion that he plans to place in Pat's ever-present 'digestive medicine' bottle.  Harry and Kay continue their secret assignations in both Kay's home and Harry's nearby country home, but things begin to muddle as Richard falls for Kay, and Kay's attention shifts to Richard, and the devoted Pat is hiding her secret lover Tom (David Richmond-Peck).  As the twists and turns surface, everything unwinds and the ending of the story comes as a surprise to everyone!

The quartet of actors - Clarkson, Cooper, Brosnan, and McAdams - serve the story well and the flavor of the 1940s starts with superb opening credit images and carries through with the fine decors and attention to detail that don't seem to miss a beat in recreating the period.  This is a difficult film to classify - it has comedy inherent in the absurdity of portions of the plot, it has drama in the core of the tale, and it has mystery as the surprises keep surfacing.  The overall effect will be different for every viewer, depending on where in the marriage spectrum each viewer stands!  Grady Harp, September 08",1220400000,19,2423,4.742857142857143
3341652,4,B0013FZUP6,"A Pierce Brosnan narrated period piece about love, marriage and in the end - friendship. I will preface this with a disclaimer - the high rating and bit about friendship is for the alternate versions of this film.

The quality of the transfer looked very good, and I think when they make heavy make-up films like this the standards have to be higher now. Making it look flawless on such beauties as McAdams and an aged Brosnan and Cooper (alternates) can be tough, but they pulled it off decently. The clarity was so good at times there were a few reflections of cameras, lights and boom mics in glasses, eyes, etc. The story was made to be very believable for the time period, but I have to give the kudos to Cooper for once again playing a great role.

But what makes this film is the alternate endings. DRASTICALLY different then what you saw in theaters and on the home release. The special features on the Blu are the same as on the DVD, so buying this Blu would be recommended for the period piece memorabilia clarity alone. Plus, the other endings showed as 1080 even though it says 480 on the box (and most alternate inclusions are lodef on Blu so that was nice). I wish there was a way to bookmark the film and splice in the much better ending(s). Rex Reed keeps getting quoted as saying this is humorous and funny but I would say expect more of a ""simmering"" slowly played film that has some fun scenes and maybe one or two themes of darkness, but is believably enjoyable.

3341654,3,B0013FZUP6,"In all of the press I have seen, in all of the interviews I have watched, everyone mentions how ""slyly funny"", how ""darkly humorous"" the new film ""Married Life"" is. The joke must have gone over my head.

Richard Langley (Pierce Brosnan) tells us the story of his great friend, Harry (Chris Cooper). Harry, a successful businessman in New York, circa 1949, has a loving, even doting wife, Pat (Patricia Clarkson). But he has fallen in love with a beautiful young widow, Kay (Rachel McAdams, ""Red Eye"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Notebook""). Rather than put his wife through the humiliation of a divorce, of leaving her, he decides to poison her. Then, a free man, he can move on and marry Kay. But Harry makes one mistake; he introduces Kay to his great friend, Richard, a lothario like no other, and he is also attracted to Kay.

Directed and co-written by Ira Sachs, ""Married Life"" is a very believable look at the way people lived in the late 40s. The attention to detail is astonishing; clothing, furniture, cars all appear authentic. In one scene, they visit a movie theater and watch a lesser known Ava Gardner film. It's a nice touch. So often in films set in the past, they go to the theater to see ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"". Sure, these are extremely memorable films, but they weren't the only three films made pre 1960.

The four leads are all very good, all very believable. Pierce Brosnan's Richard narrates the film, introducing us to the characters, to the story and guides us throughout. He speaks in a softly modulated tone, giving the film the feeling of a fable or a fairy tale. His voice, complete with Irish accent, lulls us into the story, slowly helping us get acclimated to this world. Richard is a cad, but he is a bachelor, so we can't hate him too much when we learn he sleeps around. By the time we realize he is going to try to seduce Kay away from his good friend, Harry, his behavior has become well enough established that we would be disappointed if he didn't try to sleep with the young woman.

Chris Cooper is great as Harry; there are a lot of layers to his character and they are revealed in subtle ways, giving us a great look at his character. Why would Harry think it is more desirable to kill his wife than to divorce her? In his own twisted way, this shows the depth of care he has for her. They have been together for so long, they know each other so well, and he can't fathom the thought of divorcing her. But he also realizes he doesn't love Pat anymore. His passion lies with Kay and he has had a life so devoid of passion for so long, he simply can't let it happen any longer. He needs passion, he needs Kay.

Harry clearly recognizes he has limited resources for making this happen. It has to be something that looks like an accident, or natural. He could never shoot her, or use a knife, too messy and too many bad consequences. So he decides to put poison in her medicine; Pat suffers from ulcers and heart burn so she always has a blue bottle around. As Harry sets about the task at hand, the story takes on decidedly Hitchcockian overtones. Much like ""Suspicion"" and ""Notorious"", we know more than some of the characters and this creates an additional level of suspense. Add the tongue in cheek element, and the film becomes more like Hitchcock's ""The Trouble with Harry"" or ""Family Plot"". At one point, Harry, thinking he has made a terrible mistake, races home to prevent Pat from taking an additional dose of the poison. The film presents all of these elements well, blending them deftly and creating a nice homage to these films, and this era. Cooper is also able to portray the various emotions Harry experiences, sometimes on the turn of a dime, making his character complex and believable.

Patricia Clarkson is perhaps the perfect type to play a housewife from the late forties; she just looks like she fits into this different era and might have walked out of a Norman Rockwell painting. She is also the perfect compliment to Cooper, matching his acting style to a tee. They are both very low key, very natural, and seem to be a real couple.

It is also interesting to watch Clarkson play this character as she has to walk a fine line. One the one hand, we know she is being poisoned, know she is essentially a victim, but she maintains a sunny disposition and manages to make the character seem interesting and viable, and not the least bit pathetic. Basically, she makes a character that seems very simple, someone we have figured out, and still manages to surprise us. The fact that she knows Harry doesn't love her anymore, she states as much, and stays in the relationship, provides an example of her dedication. Too bad she isn't as aware of what her husband is up to.

Rachel McAdams has been off screen for a couple of years and her portrayal of Kay only serves to make this absence all the more noticeable. Much like Clarkson, McAdams takes a character that we probably have `figured out' from the first moment we see her, and makes us feel differently about the woman. Yes, she is an adulterer, but as we get to know her, we realize there is a lot more to her. Her character becomes flesh and blood to us and we learn she is a real human being. This is Sach's best contribution to the story and the characters; details. We learn a lot about each person through observation, comments, actions.

It becomes a little more problematic when she starts to fall for Rich. She is already an adulterer and now she is cheating on the man who is cheating on his wife. But McAdams is able to convey this conflict well, giving us real insight into her character, making us appreciate this decision as well.

It sure seems like I liked ""Married Life"" and I did like many things about it. Perhaps if people weren't so intent on talking about the `dark comedy' aspect of it, I would be more appreciative. It is a very good drama, but the comedy, dark or otherwise, is almost non-existent. Even the moment when Harry rushes home to prevent Pat from taking a dose of the medicine is played more for suspense - I suspect Sachs intended this to be a humorous moment. So, ""Married Life"" isn't funny, except for the occasional mildly amusing moment. In a black comedy, I expect some outright laughs, more amusing moments, and these don't happen.

""Married Life"" is a good film, but it needs a divorce from the plugs it has been getting from the cast in recent interviews and press. Actually a divorce might just be too humiliating. These untrue rumors should probably be put to rest.",1205884800,17,6553,4.521518987341772

3341703,4,B0013FZUP6,"I am overall satisfied with the movie as I didn't have any high expectations to be met by it when I had randomly picked it in the romantic movie section of my dvd collection on a lonely rainy night expecting to be lectured only on the merits of marriage which I am somewhat supportive of. I genuinely think I would not be too generous if I gave it 4 out of 5 which is what it deserves to be given considering the excellent performances of each actor that plays in this movie. As far as the slowness of the pace, that is exactly where its unusual appealing lies in my opinion. As many of you I found it hard to get used to as well in the beginning, yet as the movie progessed it got easier to see the reason why it was made so. However, there is one rather overlooked point I'd like to mention as a righteous man briefly. It is about the way Harry is treated by his best friend Richard in the movie. I haven't seen in any of the reviews I have read a mentinoning about Richard's double backstab damage on his extremely decent friend. This has had indeed a stomach-turning effect on me during the movie. Harry who shares every little private detail in his life with Richard is oblivious of the fact that he is being taken advantage of by the one whom he expects to get some help from to make things right. Richard both sanctions Harry's wife gross action of cheating on him at their own house and as if that is not enough of a betrayal, proceeds to steal Harry's new-found oasis of peace in life. Is not a best friend supposed to stand right by your side particularly when you cordially share your deepest feelings and unsureness as to the state of your marriage or any kind of relationship in your tough days?Not to mention the scene where Harry catches Richard with his girlfriend when he unexpectedly rushes into the house to tell Kay to return him all the letters he had written for her in the course of their relatioship. His response in that scene had indeed a kind of temporary paralyzing effect on me. He is way too considerate to say the things he says there. That surely is not how a real man in love responds to a double backstab. What this movie teaches is that matters of heart, no matter how challenging they might seem at times ought to be always handled by you if you don't want to invite more trouble into your relationship than it already has.",1342483200,,2359,4.315315315315315

3341716,3,B0013FZUP6,"Based on the 1953 novel ""Five Roundabouts to Heaven"" by John Bigham, ""Married Life"" - co-written by Oren Moverman and Ira Sachs, and directed by Sachs - is a throwback to all those florid film noir melodramas in which a bored husband (Chris Cooper) plots to do away with his wife (Patricia Clarkson) so he can start a life with his mistress, a leggy, blonde widow (Rachel McAdams) whose husband died in the war.  Pierce Brosnan plays Cooper's best friend, a womanizing bachelor who, naturally, falls in love with the mistress, and who provides the overly-sincere, laughably self-conscious narration for the tale.

Though this kind of thing's been done much better in other films (""Double Indemnity,"" ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and ""How to Murder Your Wife"" spring immediately to mind), solid performances from an A-list cast, rich period detail (the movie is set in 1949), and an interesting subtext about marriage meaning different things to different people ultimately make it palatable.",1294963200,,995,5.135802469135802
3341717,3,B0013FZUP6,"I think director/co-writer Ira Sachs' subtle 2007 homage to the old-fashioned studio melodramas of the 1940s and 50s could have used more of the Baroque feverishness of a Douglas Sirk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-That-Heaven-Allows/dp/B00005BH23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All That Heaven Allows</a>) to make the adultery-driven plot more intriguing stylistically - perhaps a face slap here, a gun confrontation there, even a shouting match in a restaurant. Instead, Sachs, along with co-writer Oren Moverman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Messenger/dp/B002VECM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Messenger</a>), downplays the overripe theatrics in favor of a more Hitchcockian approach to their noirish fable about the transient rules of love and deception. The resulting film is fun to watch due to its faithful period depiction but sometimes little more than a moral exercise in punishing the subversive thoughts and actions of the seemingly staid protagonist.

It's 1949, and the plot centers on Harry, a middle-aged and very married Manhattan executive, who finds himself in love with the much younger Kay, a WWII widow who enjoys the attention of a man so devoted to her. Harry decides he cannot divorce his wife Pat for fear of breaking her heart. In fact, he thinks it's more charitable to murder her by poisoning her digestive powder which she takes religiously every day. Harry's best friend Richard is aware of Harry's intentions and gets caught in the middle trying to save the marriage while finding himself becoming attracted to Kay as well. Not quite the victim she would seem to be, Pat has secrets of her own, which leads to a roundelay of events befitting the increasingly uneasy blend of treachery and absolution. Sachs capably keeps things afloat even when the suspense factor appears overly muted.

A smart quartet of actors has been cast beginning with Chris Cooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adaptation/dp/B00005JLRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adaptation</a>) effectively embodying the crushed soul that Harry has become. Providing the voiceover narration from his character's limited perspective, Pierce Brosnan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matador/dp/B000EQ5UIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matador</a>) uses his naturally erudite manner to great wry effect as Richard, while Patricia Clarkson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whatever-Works/dp/B002LMV7RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whatever Works</a>) gives added dimensions of knowingness and cunning to Pat. With her hair dyed an unflattering peroxide blonde, Rachel McAdams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook/dp/B000683VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook</a>) looks poised to play the femme fatale, but her character is more ingenuous than she looks. That basically means McAdams has little bandwidth to add any complex shading to Kay. The 2008 DVD offers an informative commentary from Sachs, the theatrical trailer, and three alternate endings, each flash-forwarding the story sixteen years later to O. Henry-type resolutions. While interesting, none really add that much to the ending used in the movie.",1262044800,,3360,6.775462962962963

Yet it ultimately becomes a different movie at the end, going from a film noir romantic suspense thriller to something a little more akin to something John Irving would have written. I agree it's not a comedy and there are only fleeting moments of ironic humour, but, hey, what about  the alternate endings.??!! Clearly the reason the film is so short (at 87 mins)is that there is a whole final chapter running about 7-8 minutes that the director left on the cutting room floor. We get to see three edits of this final chapter on the DVD and it turns it again into quite a different film. No one else here seems to have commented on these endings and I would love to know what people thought, personally I rather liked the melancholic stroll through time feel these gave the film and feel there is an even better film lurking in here somewhere. The theatrical version, pleasing enough as it is, is weighed down with too much of an attempt to make it noirish and comical.

In spite of being in love with their new love interests, both Pat and Harry are hesitant to divorce each other in fear not to hurt the other emotionally.  So is it better to simply kill off the other person and spare them the pain of humiliation?

But here, the visuals were nothing special (other reviewers here disagreed). And the characters were poorly rendered--clearly the fault of the writers, not the actors (who just had nothing to work with).

For example, the dialog _says_ that Richard (Pierce Brosnan) is a womanizer, but what we _see_ is quite different.  There are similar disconnects for all the other characters.

Similarly the (trivial) story arc depends entirely on the voice-over--without it, I would have had a complete different interpretation of events.  Without the audio, I _never_ would have thought that Harry (Chris Cooper) was in love with Kay (McAdams) nor she with him.  Nor would I have suspected that Richard and Harry were more than casual acquaintances.

The sequence where we are waiting to find out whether Harry has murdered his wife is so far beyond over-wrought and over-extended that I became angry at the movie for being so blatant in trying to jerk my emotions around.",1241308800,2,1132,5.048387096774194

This was true that divorce did not happen in this time period, but I thought the story that the husband would rather see his wife dead than divorce her is crazy.  The movie was suspenseful, but I thought it was unfunny and not that entertaining.  I recommend renting this movie rather than buying, this movie was average.",1237075200,,672,4.387096774193548
3341722,2,B0013FZUP6,"So, truth be told, this cast is very impressive.  Chris Cooper is a very commanding presence who has recently proven his star has yet to fade (watch him work the screen ten times over in `Breach'); Pierce Brosnan is a very charming and infectious actor who knows how to deliver a delicate and nuanced performance (watch him act his butt off in `Evelyn'); Rachel McAdams is one of those actresses to watch out for, working to break out of her teen queen title with interesting choices (watch her steal every ounce of limelight with her Oscar snubbed `Mean Girls' performance); and Patricia Clarkson, I mean really, don't get me started on how amazing she is.  Watch anything she touches and see a screen presence that is beyond words.  Whether she is quietly breaking to pieces (ala `Dogville'), charismatically unraveling (ala `Pieces of April') or weighing in with a delicate bravado (ala `Far From Heaven') she is always a notch above the rest.

So with a cast this impressive this film is bound to be...boring?

I walked into `Married Life' eager to see something amazing and what I got was something I longed to see end.  It was dry, meandering and uninteresting.  It's sad, because the performances by all four actors were very, very good.  In a different movie I'd say that they were all Oscar worthy.  The pacing and mood setting was just too unbearable though, taking away every ounce of life these actors breathed into their characters.

So the film tells of a strange love triangle (or should I say square, or is it a hexagon) that forms between friends.  Harry is married to Pat, and while Harry loves Pat he is `in love' with Kay who is young and vibrant and makes him feel needed.  Harry's best friend is Richard, who upon meeting Kay is instantly smitten.  Richard falls in love with Kay and wants her all to himself, which seems possible beings that Harry is determined not to hurt his wife.  Richard's ideal plan is soon hampered by the unraveling of Pat's dark secret, not to mention the fact that Harry, in an attempt to spare his wife the pain of divorce, has decided to kill her instead.

Yes, there is a lot going on here, and it all sounds so intriguing; but it's not.

It's the pacing that kills this one and it's because of that monotone delivery that I'll never watch it again.  It nearly put me to sleep and it took me two evenings just to get through it, and it wasn't like I started it late in the evening; I simply couldn't watch it any longer.

It was that dull.

I feel bad for the cast and maybe even the screenwriter, who at least attempted to write a tightly woven and interesting marital thriller, but director Ira Sachs (I just noticed that he helped pen this thing too so maybe I don't feel bad for the screenwriter) botches this one up quite a bit.  Like I said, the acting is a saving grace (especially from Clarkson and Cooper) but in the end this marriage is not worth saving.

Oh, and so we are clear, the comparisons to `Mad Men' are quite disturbing beings that the television show is far from boring and unbelievably engrossing; something that this film is far from.",1233100800,3,3111,4.539426523297491
3341723,4,B0013FZUP6,"Name-checking the top grade cast in ""Married Life"" - a sort of 40's/50's film noir tale of marital shenanigans - will be enough to draw most movie lovers in. And while Patricia Clarkson and Rachel McAdams are typically lovely, deep and believable in their roles, it's the two men - Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper - who really get to shine.

Its directed by IRA SACHS and co-adapted by him and ORAN MOVERMAN from the 1953 book by JOHN BINGHAM called ""Five Roundabouts To Heaven"".

Narrated by Richard (Brosnan's character), you just know you're going to enjoy this story when you hear him casually say, ""I always thought marriage was a mild kind of illness...like the Flu or Chicken Pox...to which I was safely immune"". Brosnan's tone throughout the narration changes - at first it's sly and laidback and suave - so you're not sure if he's the good guy or the bad guy - or both - and nor do you want to know - because in this clever and beautifully revealing film, the finding out is half the fun...

And who out there in movie land doesn't want to see a film with Chris Cooper in it? Harry (Cooper's character) is in a stagnating but not entirely loveless marriage to Pat (Clarkson). Then along comes the young, alive and beautiful Kay (McAdams) who stirs Harry's very soul - but alas also grabs the loins of the caddish Richard (Brosnan) - his lifetime buddy and pal. Friendships are tested, plots are formed and everyone drinks loads of scotch and smokes acres of cigarettes and acts as if nothing is wrong...

The boys as you can imagine - given meaty material - are great. Warm, cold, up, down - Cooper layers his performance - and he slyly fools you too by doing so. Brosnan is still great eye-candy and effortlessly charming - caddish one moment - genuine the next - he plays his character both ways - and does it very, very well. McAdams is enough to make most grown men weak at the knees and Patricia Clarkson - who probably has the least likeable of roles - makes you empathize with her character - see her as a real person - a great performance from a genuine class act. In fact, you can 'feel' how all the actors rise to the evolving story - and you suspect they thoroughly enjoyed working off each other while making this intelligently written little gem.

Visually - it's period Americana - were in MAD MEN territory here. ""Married Life"" is gorgeous to look at - and very ""Shawshank"" in places on the outdoor scenes - an absolute blast to view on Blu Ray.

The real unexpected pleasure, however, comes in 3 fully realised Alternate Endings that are almost as enjoyable as the entire movie - and without spoiling it - they take the story to other places - and brilliantly too. Brosnan - in particular - is exceptionally good.

There's a commentary by director and co-script writer Ira Sachs, but it's a damn shame there isn't an on-set segment - because here's actors and a movie you admire - and it would also have been just great to get the writer and director's perspective in interview outside of listening to the entire commentary.

Not a masterpiece for sure, but a great little watch nonetheless and one that deserves your attention.

""Did We Build Our Happiness On The Unhappiness of Others...?"" Brosnan asks towards the end of his voice over - watch this 'classy' little noir thriller to find out...",1232841600,3,3321,4.558724832214765

3341725,4,B0013FZUP6,"The film zips along with its solid script, witty and snappy dialogue and thoughtful and deliciously unpredictable moments. More than once, I was literally at the edge of my seat holding my breath. In 1949, it's a simpler time with diners, luncheons, tea, radio, and dancing on the town or to the picture show as an actual night out. There's something overall romantic about this time. The narration, which I have grown tired of as a plot device (I see it as such a short cut to the main ideas too often), actually works here in adding to the overall nostalgia and quaintness. Many scenes are like Hopper paintings come alive making Married Life a visual treat as well as a compelling film.

The cast is impressive from Pierce Brosnan (The Matador, Die Another Day) to Academy Award winner Chris Cooper (Adaptation, Breach) to indie steady Patricia Clarkson (Lars and the Real Girl). Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, The Notebook) is lovely and so good in these period roles. She looks comfortable and there are layers of sweetness under that platinum hair. Clarkson possesses the right amount of mischief and devotion in her role as the dutiful, seemingly predictable wife. Brosnan is brooding and complex and yummy. I just couldn't buy the Cooper vs. Brosnan though. Hands down I would take a wolf in Brosnan's clothing instead of a sheep like Cooper's character. Cooper/McAdams give the impression of father/daughter more than older man/younger woman. But please don't let that stop you, somehow it all flows along. I suppose that in Harry, a young widow would view safe and secure instead of adventure and excitement in a guy like Rich. The entire cast is so ridiculously talented that you come to like every character in some way.

Married Life is a fantastic film that will seduce you from its first scene to its last.",1231286400,5,1824,4.842948717948718
