3041980,1,B000ZIZX3G,"I jumped up and down excitedly in the driveway finding the T.D. Jakes teaching in the mail.  I could hardly wait to put it on and receive almost an hour of actual teaching.  I have never paid money for a teaching, but when watching a half-hour program on one of the Bible networks, ( which is on twice a week at 1:30 am) it left me a desire to see the entire sermon.  I summon up the courage and faith to purchase one of the sermons always being advertised - and what do I get?

5 minutes of preaching?!!!!!

3041984,5,B000ZIZX3G,"Once Again I was blown away by another great addition to Repostion Yourself. The content was excellent , Life changing as usual. I have watched the dvd over and over again. Each time I gain a little more. I thought to myself, that this dvd should have been advertised. People will gain so much from it, to help expand their thinking, and hear some great testimonies. To my surprise, I was on the dvd. I was at the Apollo when Bishop came to New York , a once in a life time experience. This is a must have product, to all who are in the process of repostioning . Thank You Bishop for lives are changing rapidly because of you.",1207612800,12,626,4.225

3041986,5,B000ZIZX3G,"T.D. Jakes has been one of my favorite preachers for a while now. He always has a message for you if you are ready to hear it. In this documentary style movie we see the lives of various people who have changed course with God's help. This is not a sermon but rather snippets of sermons and motivational talks. The stories of other people intertwine with T.D. Jakes message. I especially liked his story of the eagle. Basically the message was about an eagle that holds onto prey that is too large for it and the eagle gets killed by the prey. What T.D. Jakes said next after the story was profound. ""Drop it or it will drop you."" I so needed to hear that because I'm going through something that I'm taking a little too seriously. Sometimes people hurt you and maybe they don't do it intentionally. So anyway I got a fortune cookie tonight and when I opened it it was empty. No fortune. So I figure God gave me a message from T.D. Jakes instead. Thank you T.D. for always being so inspirational.

3041993,5,B000ZIZX3G,"I am a pastor and I found this DVD in the clearance bin at a local Christian book store.  I like Bishop Jakes and thought that I would show this one night for Bible Study.  It was a blessing.  I could tell the attendees were really processing what he was saying.  I like the fact that it wasn't just preaching.  He used various ways to make his points.  I went back for some more copies to give to some people who I thought could benefit from the message. This video prompted me to order the 4-part DVD series (I don't see it offered by Amazon ... I got it from another retailer).  We have watched 2 parts so far ... a great blessing!  The part that was focused on the female audience was a blessing to the men in our study group as well.  I thought to myself at the end of ""Cinderella's Stillettos"" that I should have asked our musicians to attend to provide a little ""praise music"" because the ladies were ready to ""take it in there"" (you will only relate if you attend a ministry that has a more charismatic worship style). It has been a good fit for the New Year.  The number 12's Biblical significance is ""order"", ""authority"", ""establishment"", etc.  So this is a good time to ""reposition yourself"".
