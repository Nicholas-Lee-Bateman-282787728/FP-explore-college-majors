Very well proportioned and yet not too skinny. Looks strong and empowering so she reflects what you want to be like as you work your body out along with her and her assistants.",1226448000,,351,4.333333333333333
2658798,3,B000ILYYVC,This DVD is quite complete but I could have done without the information regarding peri-menopause and menopause and a little more exercise. If you are in to menopause you will want to skip the info part of the DVD and once you have listened to it it will just be a waste of space.,1222732800,3,280,4.203703703703703

2658800,5,B000ILYYVC,"With a job change I was not getting to the gym as often as I needed to. I bought this disk as an auxillary workout between gym visits.  I found that it was very well-rounded and actually gave me a better workout than I had at the gym.  I was out of shape when I started, but was able to get through it and as my shape improved I continued to be challenged by it.  As a female over 45 and appreciated the information about pre-menapause though I just fast forward through it now.",1196467200,7,478,4.0638297872340425
2658801,5,B000ILYYVC,"I have many of Kathy Smith's workouts, and I was looking for something new to add to my collection. This DVD ended up to be exactly what I was looking for. Although I am just entering peri-menopause (I'm 42), I found the information about menopause to be very interesting. I am definitely forearmed. The low-impact workout was very fun; I especially enjoyed the cha-cha cross-over step! The last combination or so was a little challenging to figure out which leg was to come up on which side in order to make the combination work from side to side, but after doing it quite a few times, I made a mental note to lift the knee that was on the side I was turning (hopefully that makes sense to someone else). I can now say I've got that down. There are a few places where Kathy lets your heart rate recuperate a little and then she brings it back up, again, which (in my opinion) would make the workout easier for people of any level to complete.

The strength training was very enjoyable, too. In fact, I was surprised that I was sore in a few backside places after doing it. It will be a workout I won't mind doing over and over because Kathy doesn't add any frill to her calls. (Kathy looks just wonderful in all of the workouts, but I'd have to say I don't really care for her outfit in this one!)

The yoga workout was a very lovely stretching, centering, and relaxing workout. Quickly removing your socks and shoes after the previous workout and removing any clips in your hair make the routine much more relaxing!

I haven't done the ball routine, yet, so I can't comment on that.

The end of the DVD contains excerpts of interviews of doctors regarding menopause and how to minimize its symptoms. I found it rather perplexing (in a jesting sort of way) that when Kathy complains about each of the symptoms (to represent the average menopausal woman), often the response is to engage in regular exercise to minimize or eliminate that symptom. I'm not sure how this would be comforting to Kathy who probably exercises more than the average Jane!

Again, this DVD was exactly what I wanted. I took the summer off from exercising for various reasons, and now that all my kids are in school, I wanted to get back into it. I have a perfect place to work out and a new DVD to get motivated In my opinion, this is a great addition to anyone's library.",1193961600,10,2348,4.438515081206496

2658804,5,B000ILYYVC,"This is my current favorite workout dvd - I have used it since January.  It is a supplement to my regime of daily walking.  I find it is easy to squeeze in 20 minute segments throughout the week.  The ""moving through menopause"" exercises are  my favorite portion.  The aerobic section is good when the weather is bad or time is of the essence.  The strength training section is something I do 2-3 times a week - it is manageable and easy to follow and, believe me, has made a differnce in my body tone.  The yoga section is very relaxed and something I enjoy. It is not strenuous but I find it is a nice change of pace to stretch gently and it really calms me down, which helps keep my blood pressure normal. I have exercised since I can remember taking on all forms of it - jogging, aerobic dance, low impact aerobics, ballet (for 18 years), yoga, tennis, etc. This is the first year ever I have taken off from all that - taking a break from all the reoccuring injuries - and I feel better.",1183593600,15,991,4.23936170212766
2658805,4,B000ILYYVC,"As advertised, this Body Boomers DVD contains three separate workouts.  What is NOT advertised is that these are ALL re-releases from older videos from Kathy Smith--some so older that they were originally released on VHS!  While I did not have a huge issue with this, I do think it should have been made clearer to consumers.

The Main Menu for this DVD is as follows:
***Moving Through Menopause  PLAY/EXERCISES
***Shaper Ball Workout  PLAY/EXERCISES
***Wellness Mind and Body Relaxation System  PLAY/EXERCISES
***Play ALL WORKOUTS
I've broken down each separate workout below, linking to the listing for that individual product on Amazon.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moving-Through-Menopause/dp/B00005NGA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moving Through Menopause</a>
Kathy Smith originally released this DVD in 2001.  It is designed to provide workout routines appropriate to middle-aged women, and it also offers educational information.  The submenu for this section includes the following options:  What is Menopause - Benefits of Cardio - Low-Impact Cardio Workout - Benefits of Strength Training - Importance of Reducing Stress - Stress-Reducing Yoga - FAQs about Menopause - End Credits

I'm in my late 40s, and although not in menopause, I do sometimes modify my workouts, and I often tend to prefer shorter routines.  I liked that each of the three sections here (cardio, weights, yoga) was under 20 minutes long.  The cardio was basic, with moves such as knees, kicks, taps, punches, and hamstring curls.  Smith does do a few higher impact moves, but she has two background exercisers modifying.  The strength routine starts with stretching using a towel and moves into exercises using light dumbbells (3-5 lbs.).  This was more beginner than my level, but good for light days.  The yoga segment was just 14 minutes long, and was all on the floor.  Overall, it was quite gentle, with a nice series of forward bends (great for before bed!), although the shoulderstand/plow series was significantly more advanced than the rest of the routine.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaper-Ball-Workout/dp/B0000C0FGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaper Ball Workout</a>
Smith released this workout as part of her ""Timesaver"" series in 2000.  It uses a stability ball, and I actually reviewed it back in 2005 (click on the link above to read my full review).  It's a decent workout that mainly focuses on the abs, back, and lower body, although it is somewhat slow-moving.  The total time for this routine is 29 minutes.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wellness-Mind-and-Body-Relaxation-System/dp/B00004RF7F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wellness Mind and Body Relaxation System</a>
This routine was actually released on VHS back in 1977!!!  The menu options include Program Start - Workout Overview - Warm-up - Standing Workout - Floor Workout - Deep Relaxation - End Credits.  This is more of a yoga practice than the segment included on Moving Through Menopause, yet the pace felt rather uneven to me, especially with the strong emphasis on backbends.  Smith starts releasing the arms, shoulders, and neck with moves such as arm circles and neck rolls.  Coming to hands and knees, she moves through cat/cow and elbow to knee.  Next comes floorwork (clicking on the ""Standing Workout"" section took me straight to the floor--I don't think there are any standing poses in this routine!).  This section might be challenging for beginners, as it includes locust, bow, bridge, reclined hamstring stretch, reclined twist, and seated forward bend.  The practice finishes with a short relaxation.

So long as you realize what you are getting, this DVD could be a good buy, as you get three workouts in one, although they are all prior releases.",1473465600,,3849,5.7

2658809,4,B000ILYYVC,I bought this for my mom to replace her old VHS tapes. She already enjoys it. The information this dvd provides is wonderful and useful. I myself can't wait to try out the meditation workout included on the dvd. I enjoy Kathy Smith workouts and have been using them for ages. I watched the Menopause workout section and it seemed like a wonderful workout! Years ago I had done the shaper ball workout and enjoyed it! I am so thrilled to have this workout on dvd!,1454630400,,462,4.383720930232558
2658810,2,B000ILYYVC,Rather boring. I have been using Kathy Smith work outs sincenter the early '90's. Timeless is definitely not my favorite workout. I got bored quickly. I tossed it out not long ago. I still have quite a collection of Kathys other dvd's. Timeless was just not for me.,1452297600,,265,4.541666666666667
2658811,5,B000ILYYVC,Kathy Smith delivers. Skip to the workouts-- you can since the DVD is chaptered.,1451174400,,80,4.785714285714286

2658813,4,B000ILYYVC,"I bought this DVD in order to get back into a regular workout routine after a couple of years off. Previously, I had used Jillian Michaels' DVDs but was increasingly unable to maintain her pace and intensity due to lower back and hip pain, as well as a resurgence of hypothyroid symptoms and asthma. I am now almost 50 and still dealing with hypothyroid issues and low iron.

Kathy Smith is very encouraging and upbeat without being annoyingly perky during routines. The various workouts are arranged in compact segments, so if you do not have a hour to workout, you can do one of the shorter routines (strength workout is about 30 minutes; the abs workout is broken into even shorter segments so you can do one or two segments or the whole routine).  I also like that it has two different yoga sequences. The cardio and strength routines have two other participants - one does the more advanced moves and the other does the beginner moves. The Moving through Menopause sections have been informative even though I am not quite there yet. I just skip over them if I'm in a hurry.

I first started using this DVD in February of this year and I found it to be more challenging that I anticipated - especially the cardio (which is a weak area for me). About 8 years ago, I had been going to a gym and doing regular cardio workouts (step aerobics and low-impact aerobics), so I maintained a memory of how to walk through routines that I did not yet know. Like any other exercise DVD, there is a learning curve - there were parts of the cardio segment where I just had to stop, walk in place and watch what she was doing or go back and watch that part over again. My goal was to learn the routine properly so as not to injure myself, so if it took a bit longer, I was OK with sticking with a slower pace.  Even with that approach, I did find that after just a few weeks of doing these routines 4-5 days/week, I was already losing inches, firming up (especially abs, butt and thighs) and had lost a few pounds - and I wasn't working out for hours every day (I would do cardio and abs one day, then strength & yoga the next day, etc.). For the strength routine, I started a 2 lb weights and worked myself up to 5 lb weights.

Overall, I have really enjoyed this DVD because the routines are effective but not overly difficult - especially if you start at a slower pace with the beginner moves.",1442102400,14,2386,4.3408071748878925

2658824,3,B000ILYYVC,"I injured myself right when I got this CD...it wasn't the CD's fault, I had injured myself prior to receiving it in the mail...so when I started doing the aerobics part of the CD, I wasn't able to do it.  Very disappointed.  However, the CD was good.  As many others have noted, the videos are a rehash of earlier materials, but it's together in one format here.  I liked the advice on menopausal women, and how to cope.  Even if you get it for the advice, it's a good CD.",1429488000,,472,4.2
2658825,5,B000ILYYVC,"My favorite exercise coach. Just the right amount of motivating enthusiasm, without making you feel like you're being cheered on by a ""14-year-old cheerleader turned military drill instructor.""

2658827,4,B000ILYYVC,"I always like Kathy Smith workouts and this is a very good one for cardio and flexibility.  I'm in my early 60's and have to be careful with my back, knees and ankles.  MOST of her exercises on this video were just what I was looking for.  I am just getting back into cardio due to ankle injury so I could only do 20 minutes for a few days, but still felt results!",1418601600,2,364,3.958904109589041

2658833,5,B000ILYYVC,"Quick shipping & the items is terrific for us 40+ ladies.  Currently I am only using the Cardio section of this video.  I love it because it is challenging & this portion is only 20 minutes long.  I remember Kathy Smith from the 80's & she really knows her fitness & this video has total body fitness.  Looking forward to incorporating the other sections to my fitness routine in the future. Thank you, Kathy :)",1400976000,,411,4.44

2658836,4,B000ILYYVC,"I really like anything Kathy Smith does. This is a good video for mature women in good shape or those who need to be in a bit better shape. It gives you a choice of levels. You can choose how many sessions you want and which type, free weights, yoga, cardio...

2658838,1,B000ILYYVC,"I am quite surprised to see this exercise video rated so highly,and since I have a very different view, I feel an obligation to provide a review..  I have two reasons for saying I hate the DVD.  First of all a lot of this DVD is a lecture on change of life and thus much of the DVD is going to be a one-time view.  More important, when I started the exercise portion I found the music to be so unpleasant that I ejected the DVD.  For me at least, the music matters - it provide energy and rhythm to add pleasure to the routine.",1386892800,29,527,3.9904761904761905
2658839,2,B000ILYYVC,Perfect for someone who can do high impact but doesn't work with my knee. Not much structure to overall program either.,1383868800,6,119,4.714285714285714
2658840,5,B000ILYYVC,"We all hate to admit it, but we do slow down. I injured myself earlier this year, and my recovery has been soooo slow, I almost gave up. Especially when I gained 10 pounds in six months because I couldn't work out. This DVD has saved me! I have always appreciated Kathy Smith as she is a no nonsense kind of gal. Her approach is realistic. Her DVDs are NOT ""all flash and no substance"". They appeal to the age they are presented and marketed to.
 I like the information that she has added to it. I like the format. It gives variety. She is easy to listen to.
I am back on the track and within one week, I feel a difference!
Thank you, Kathy, for your commitment to your audience.",1381104000,12,679,4.143939393939394
2658841,4,B000ILYYVC,"There is much menopause info presented along with the 3 workouts.  I especially like the strength training one as it is low impact and not hard on my knees.  The cardio workout is a little fast paced and has dance type moves and the yoga is new to me but was also nice as well. It doesn't say and I have not times them but I think the workouts are about 20 minutes long.  I am kind of at an intermediate level but can't take too much impact so this was a little on the easy side for me, although some days, it was just right! Theres a shaper ball workout but it seems dated and I never use it.  I would recommend this to someone looking for an easy to intermediate workout and who wants to find out more on menopause.  Kathy narrates through the exercises and gives some helpful little tidbits.",1379548800,2,794,4.163398692810458
2658842,1,B000ILYYVC,"I'm giving this workout DVD 1 star so that people will read it.  I'm in my early 60s and I always think that I should get a ""pass"" on doing the hard stuff in workouts.  Until, that is, I found out how old Kathy Smith is.  I keep thinking she's, like, 35.  Guess again my friends.  She was born in December, 1951!!  So that makes her, at the time of this writing, 61 years old . . . almost 62!!

I guess I have no more excuses!  I ""get"" that Kathy Smith has been doing this for her whole life.  I ""get"" that Kathy Smith is in shape and I'm not.  But, come on!  I just think if SHE can get up in the morning and decide to keep her body in shape, I can do the same thing!  And, to take a page from Diane Nyads' book (Diane Nyad is the 64 year old woman who, recently, swan the 110 miles from Havana Harbor in Cuba to Key West in the USA WITHOUT the aid of a shark cage.), ""FIND A WAY!""",1378857600,8,882,3.759562841530055
2658843,5,B000ILYYVC,"Firstly, this DVD has a lot of stuff on it. So it offers a lot for your exercise dollar, and you don't really need anymore than this DVD to get all the exercise you need, especially if you're just getting started. The Moving Through Menopause portion has three effective 20 minute workouts that makes perfect sense to do even you're not at menopause yet or anywhere near it, as I'm not yet at menopause yet. It's in fact a great workout if you're not a baby boomer. The yoga portion is more like deep stretches, and it's a great substitute for Wai Lana's Easy Series if the Easy Series is a little too hard for you.

Then the Shaper Ball Workout is awesome. It's a total body workout and stretching on the stability ball. This workout is 28 minutes, still not long, and it has some of the super moves in Cathe Friedrich's ball workouts.

And then it has a Wellness, Mind, & Body Relaxation System. Which is a longer and more advanced yoga workout than the one on Moving Through Menopause. And it's kind of long, 38 minutes. I haven't done this yoga yet, but it's more Wai Lana Easy like.",1378339200,26,1087,4.376237623762377

2658845,3,B000ILYYVC,"Not a good workout for beginners.  Lots of knee lifting and choreography.  The instructor doesn't teach the moves, you need to watch and learn them. Trial by fire!  I felt frustrated 10 minutes in because she just changes the moves.  Definitely have to LEARN the workout.  I do think it's a good workout, especially if you can do her advanced moves.

2658852,5,B000ILYYVC,"Kathy is good at cueing and using good form.  I like the tips she gives in this DVD for women in the baby boomers age group.  Knowledge is power, so I try to read all the info I can to help myself.",1360454400,,197,3.6666666666666665
2658853,5,B000ILYYVC,"Challenging for this out of shape 59 yr old gal, but I can get thru it.  Past experience with Kathy Smith is that she gets me in shape!  I love how I feel when I'm done!",1360368000,34,169,3.6666666666666665
2658854,5,B000ILYYVC,I have always enjoyed Kathy Smith's workouts.  These are some of her old favorites remixed onto a new DVD.  Still classic.,1359849600,7,122,4.761904761904762
2658855,5,B000ILYYVC,I like her approach and it's broken up into 3 routines so I can do what I have time for.,1359504000,7,88,3.45
2658856,4,B000ILYYVC,"You get basically 3+ workouts.  One is totally new and the other 2 are recycled from some of Kathy's other videos.  The new one having to do with moving thru menopause is very good.  I like the info about menopause the the explanations about why strength training, cardio workouts, and yoga are important.  The workouts in this section are short and fun.",1356480000,21,354,4.661290322580645
2658857,5,B000ILYYVC,"I have so many of Kathy Smith's dvd's I have honestly lost count. So that will tell you how great of an instructor she is. Although I am not going through menopause-yet- it is still an excellent workout for me. I have knee and back issues so this dvd is just the right level of activity. Also, Kathy offers tidbits of knowledgeable advice about menopause. The yoga relaxtion and stretch is short, sweet, and one of the best I have had. If you're a woman, this dvd is a must. Sooner or later.",1354752000,19,491,4.290322580645161
2658858,4,B000ILYYVC,"There are different workouts on this DVD to suit different levels of already-fit boomers. I didn't think this was a good place to start for someone who's just trying to get back into exercise, though. Even the low level is pretty intense, but you can dial it back yourself. At least you can grow with it as you get into better shape. Kathy Smith is awesome and does a great job of leading you through the workouts. My only complaint is that the workouts are too long and too intense - it's easy to overdo because you want to follow along and keep up.",1353888000,2,550,4.298076923076923
2658859,5,B000ILYYVC,"This video contains three workouts, one a vigorous aerobic segment, one emphasizing balance and weight training, and a relaxing yoga cool down/tension release session.  In between Kathy Smith talks about various issues impacting on post menopausal health.  The aerobic and balance sessions are each about 20 minutes in length.  The aerobic segment in particular really had me working hard and was an efficient workout when you don't have a lot of time but want to get the metabolism moving.  Being 58 and someone who has always tried to maintain fitness, I find Kathy Smith's workouts to be both enjoyable and effective.",1351728000,75,620,5.108910891089109

2658861,5,B000ILYYVC,"I truly enjoy when several DVDs are combined into one and this set is fantastic.  I enjoy the Menopause DVD section, which is broken down into 20 minute section as well as the fabulous 30 minute yoga workout help invigorate me to start the day.",1328313600,2,244,4.4222222222222225
2658862,5,B000ILYYVC,"I am enjoying the dvd almost every day. There are so many varied workouts - the shaper ball and other ""props"" help keep it fun and varied. I learned alot about this time of my life and I must admit - with all the hardships - Kathy is definitely encouraging!",1273795200,,257,4.16
2658863,5,B000ILYYVC,"This DVD is perfect for the exercise-at-home person. It is richly diversified and easy to use. The menu makes it so that you never have to watch or exercise to the same module twice. You can pick and choose your own work-out from beginning to end. If you forget what Kathy Smith has to say it's easy to go back to the menu and select the module. The primary disciplines are Cardio, Weight Training, Stability Ball and Yoga with stretching included in every segment. Even my 16-year-old has joined me and according to her I'm over-the-hill at 56.",1254873600,3,545,4.571428571428571
8146061,5,B000ILYYVC,I love this video. I didn't need all the information as I have been in menopause for a long time at 61. I am in shape but I did need something a little lighter taking in to consideration my age. All the other videos for seniors are too simple as I have lots of energy and have been working out for many years. This was gentle yet effect which is what I wanted and not boring. Love her and have for years.,1525219200,,404,3.9390243902439024

8146064,2,B000ILYYVC,I think it should be explained on the cover that its for people already in quite good shape - probably not older people.,1504569600,2,120,4.260869565217392

8146066,2,B000ILYYVC,Kathy has done better. Too much talking and not enough exercise. Plus exercises she did do were just so/so. Meh..........not her best effort.,1500508800,,141,5.173913043478261
8146067,1,B000ILYYVC,"I'm 63 and average build- not obese. I'm out of shape for sure, and though they say this is for all fitness levels, don't kid yourself. I can't do 75% of these moves. I'm active in walking long distances but need more stretch and yoga. But these cardio moves are not for older ladies. Still I was able to glean some of the ideas and make them useful in a daily routine. I just don't do them with the DVD because it makes me feel pretty ridiculous watching these very fit women doing speeds and moves my body won't do.",1499212800,3,517,4.18
8146068,5,B000ILYYVC,"Not too strenuous, good information",1495411200,,35,6.2
8146069,3,B000ILYYVC,"If you are in your 40s or 50s the information on peri-menopause and menopause in this DVD may be enlightening. The actual workouts seem to be for someone who is already fit. I had to modify a lot of the exercises as I'm nearing 50. I actually laughed out loud and said: ""that's not happening"" when I saw one of the exercises.

So I'd say you have to be fairly flexible and maybe even be a student of yoga to do some of these exercises. The strength workout is however fairly doable. I felt the aerobics was a bit too complicated with dance steps...I modified yet again. The relaxation workout did not make me feel relaxed although it is low impact and mostly done on the floor. It was more like yoga than just stretching. So there might be something here that you can use. I'd only recommend this for intermediate to advanced practitioners of yoga.
