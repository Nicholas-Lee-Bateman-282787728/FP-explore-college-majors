7889244,4,630538505X,"First off, this DVD is noticably missing some scenes. But because there are no known full-cut versions other than maybe a VHS. This DVD will have to do until we get a better version.

This film explores the many wonders that reside in Asia. Some shockings, Some plain nonsense. We are treated to visuals of what the Asian people dine on. Wether it's bats and other animals being slaughtered, actual dead bodies, taboo mutilation. And a sequence shown in graphic detail where a man gets a sex change. Probably the most disturbing scene in the entire film. It's sure to give male viewers nightmares. A sex museum is also explored in this film. I wouldn't really call it shocking. The movie has more of an educational feel to it. And must be seen by fans of this genre. The sequel isn't too bad either.

Of course it mild compared to others, Like Faces Of Death or Traces of Death. If you're seeking a casual and interesting film, you will enjoy this. But if you're seeking a more hardcore subject matter, Look for the above mentioned titles.

This film won't disapoint those that are familiar with this genre.",1205193600,,1107,4.6091370558375635
7889245,2,630538505X,"This is not the original Shocking Asia in its entirety.  I would say that this DVD is missing about 20 minutes of footage.  If you look hard, you might find an original on VHS.  This, however, was a complete waste of money.  The video and Audio looks like a bad VHS rip.",1163894400,2,270,4.134615384615385
7889246,4,630538505X,"Japanese dwarf wrestling! Indian self-mutilation! Graphic butchery of animals! An actual sex-change operation! You get the idea...break out a six-pack and dig this entertaining MONDO CANE clone designed to make Occidentals tremble with rage and loathing. It's actually a well-done and rather educational film for those who can hack the subject matter. Picture quality is generally excellent, though a couple of tape glitches can be seen...not too bad, though, and not the DVD's fault, as they're clearly in the source material. I heartily recommend this disc to all seekers of the unusual, but, need I add: be careful who you allow to watch, as it's not for kids or the easily offended. Watch for SHOCKING ASIA 2!",1126483200,4,713,5.102564102564102
7889247,5,630538505X,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  One that I discovered when I was a teenager.  I can't understand why this is not available on DVD as it is such a great film.  It is relatively well-known so I believe there has to be a big enough market for it.  I hope one of the big 3 cult ""grindhouse"" dvd companies will release it so this will be available in the quality it deserves.

As nothing else is available, I have bootleg copies of this and the second one on DVD.  I hope I will soon be able to upgrade to a full blown restored DVD release!

This is the only Mondo series that in my opinion belongs in the same league as the Jacopetti and Prosperi films.  It is one of the all real content Mondos which is the only Mondo film I have an interest in.  This movie also utilizes a grand musical score that really adds the Mondo Cane type feel to it.

You see people pearcing themselves with swords and pins, actual sex change footage, midget entertainment, snake eating, etc. etc. etc.

The main criticism I hear about this movie is that it is not an accurate depiction of everyday life in Asian cultures.  Of course not.  I don't see how anyone could assume that is the intention of the film.

This is a mondo film.  It is meant to show us things that are unusual to us.  Certainly, a just-as-strange mondo film could be made with things occuring in our own country/state and even perhaps city depending on where you live.

Some of the things are indeed common life such as a mother buying a live snake in the market that she will serve to her family.

On the other hand, the majority of Singaporians are probably not getting sex changes.

This Shocking Asia and Shocking Asia II are excellent.  I am obtaining a VHS copy of Shocking Asia III but I haven't seen that before so I can't comment.  It is not directed by Rolf Olsen and films of these sorts often have ""sequels"" that have nothing to do with the originals and are made by entirely unrelated producers in other foreign markets just capitalizing on the name.

I don't know anything about the 3rd one.

Anyway write to Blue Underground and express your interest in this title.",1115510400,2,2139,4.359493670886076
7889248,5,630538505X,"This is a very entertaining film about the stranger aspects of Asia whose graphic depiction of a male-to-female sex change operation is sure to make the guys in the audience groan.  It's been quite some time since I first saw the film, which covers such things as regional sex-related attractions, occult practices, and odd things that people ingest for medicinal purposes.  After having made a few trips to Southeast Asia and Japan, I'll definitely have to buy a copy of the film, and will probably now be able to relate to the film a bit better (not that I took part in any of the practices or activities covered in the film, mind you.)",1103068800,2,638,4.587719298245614
7889249,5,630538505X,I saw this film back in the late 80's and boy it sure was some werd and wild things going on overthere. Ithink everyone that sees this will injoy it.,951091200,2,149,4.0
7889250,4,630538505X,"If a film crew were to dig as deep into the USA as that film crew did into Asia, they'd come up with some shocking stuff too.  Don't believe me?  Take a trip to Mardi Gras or an underground club.  I'm sure  they'd think we're just as ""shocking.""  Either way, it's pretty  cool!",940550400,8,277,4.132075471698113
