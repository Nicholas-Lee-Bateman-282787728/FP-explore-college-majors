5470184,5,B00AQB2AR4,"For his second solo recording in about a year, Steven Wilson went into the studio with his touring band and Alan Parsons at the recording console. Most of the basic tracks were recorded live in the studio. The six extended songs are filled with rich melody, vivid lyric imagery, superb sonics and changing time signatures. This album sets a new bar for progressive rock. Wilson has been busy remixing classic progressive rock albums by King Crimson, Jethro Tull and ELP to surround. And he has absorbed much of that material like a sponge, twisting and blending many of the ideas into his own musical stew. This will be hard to beat for album of the year. And the surround mix on the Blu-ray is perfect, giving the dense instrumental palette room to breathe.",1362009600,2,758,4.706766917293233

5470188,5,B00AQB2AR4,"This is the album of the decade - by the most prolific and amazing musician/artist in progressive music of our time.

In summary, a must buy for:
1- Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No-Man fans
2- Progressive rock fans
3- Anybody that loves great quality music with unparalleled quality sound

This is a music focused, audiophile grade Blu-Ray - this is not a live concert performance.  Even though there's an interesting and fun video bonus with a documentary of the making of the album, it is what it is - a bonus.  I have a substantial collection of music Blu-Rays, DVD-Audios and SACDs, and I can say that this is the best sounding non-classical, non-jazz album in my entire collection.  And in the rock/progressive rock category, it is by far the best sounding 5.1 mix that I've ever enjoyed.

Contents:
- Album in 5.1 LPCM 24 bits, 96 Khz  (my preferred option for surround)
- Album in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround
- Album in 2.0 stereo, 24 bit, 96Khz
- Instrumental album in 2.0 stereo, 24 bit, 96Khz, plus lounge version of ""Drive Home""
- Documentary on the making of the album.  This is a compilation of the video clips had been available before album release in Steve Wilson's web site, plus the a short clip of the London Orchestra string section and Steven Wilson playing the original King Crimson mellotron.

Luminol (12:10).
This song has been previewed extensively during Steven Wilson's Grace for Drowning Tour in 2012, and in the recent Blu Ray of his performance in Mexico.  The song is about a street musician/performer who spends his life performing and doing what he enjoyed the most in life, but being largely ignored.  When he passes away, he comes back as a ""ghost"" to play in the same spot he used to, but with the same end result of being again ignored - it did not matter that he was alive or dead.
The song has three segments, the first very ""jazzy"" and lively with drums, guitars, keyboards, and bass/stick exploding into high tempo.  The second part is a very soft interlude with Steve's voice and chorus leading the way interspersed with great flute solos, which tell the story.  The third part comes back to the original jazz infused high tempo and great interplay among all instruments/musicians.  The introduction to this third piece is highlighted by the original mellotron used by Robert Fripp from the early King Crimson albums, followed by great piano work by Adam Holzman.  Marco Minnemann's drumming really shines in the high tempo pieces of the song, bringing a lot of power, improvisation and focus into the song, which clearly brings into light why Steven preferred to use Marco instead of Gavin Harrison in drums in for the past two albums.  Gavin is an extraordinary, precise drummer - a true musician that made Porcupine Tree what it was for the last few albums, but for Steven's solo work he chose Marco to add a more jazz oriented, improvisational dimension.  Marco hits the drums so hard like there is no tomorrow - and it works!  Absolutely complex yet beautiful song

Drive Home (7:37)
This is the first ballad in the album.  Steven's voice has matured to a point where he can actually carry the song beautifully and with great emotion.  The song is filled with great textures and layers, especially the lush electronic violin effects, flute and piano.  A very long and beautiful electric guitar solo starting from the middle of the song and carries to the end is very special indeed.  One of the best guitar solos I've listened to in a long time!  Gorgeous song - it could be a single if it wasn't because it is very long and Steven could not care less about singles versus the holistic, concept album, which is more than OK.

The Holy Drinker (10:14)
This song continues and somewhat steps it up with the lively, jazzy flavor from Luminol.  The introduction is a whole chaotic but tasty blend of all the instruments molding together - starting with keybords and effects, flute, drums, bass and flowing into the main groove that tells that story.  Marco's drumming again leads the way here through various tempo changes.  The middle of the song showcases a great interaction between several keyboard and flute solos.  These are again complex but very accessible after a few listens.  This is followed by a very soft section where the Holy Drinker goes to hell, where Steve's voice really highlights the emotion very well, aided by great keyboard and howling wolves background sound effects.  And after this Nick Beggs (Bass/stick) comes to work along with Marco's violent drumming and great electric guitar riffs that lead to a fantastic head banging finale.  The last few seconds of the song accentuates again the howling wolves sound effect.  One of my favorites in the album - but it's hard to pick any favorite - all of the songs are so strong!

The Pin Drop (5:35)
The introduction to this song is led by an acoustic guitar riff and keyboard work reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd's ""Poles Apart"" from the Division Bell.  This is quickly followed by Steven Wilson's voice expressing great emotion and leading to a faster tempo interplay led by Marco's drumming and Theo Davis saxophone playing, and an awesome guitar solo.

The Watchmaker (11:41)
The song starts very softly with an acoustic guitar combined with Steven's singing and group's chorus - paralleling the lonely and quite life of the now old Watchmaker.  The song continues for a few minutes on with a beautiful arrangement of acoustic guitar, flute, keyboards and voice interplays.  At the four minute mark, an acoustic guitar riff introduces a faster tempo, very tasty interlude that slowly brings the other instruments:  drums, piano, keyboard flute, mellotron and electric guitar riffs.  As this segment ends, a crescendo piano introduces Steven's voice and chorus telling the rest of the story and a secret that the Watchmaker's has held for years that he had killed his wife in the shop and now she's come back to keep him company as a ghost, so nothing really changed for him.  At the 9 minute mark Nick Beggs comes to work with a mean, powerful bass solo followed by a chorus/bass stick and drums finale.  Absolutely magnificent song!

The Raven That Refused to Sing (7:57)
The second ballad of the album.  The song is about the sad life of an old, lonely man who missed her defunct sister and traps a raven and brings it to his home.  He implores the raven to so that it can bring back his sister to life.  The very beginning of the song sounds like it could belong in the Storm Corrosion album.  Steven Wilson's voice again captures a huge amount of powerful emotion here, like in no other song that I can ever remember.  Steven has always been a competent singer with a fairly low key, mellow voice, but I feel that in the past his voice was one more instrument and lyrical support for his instrumentally rich songs.  Not anymore.  Steven's voice and delivery really carries the song and emotionally involves the listener into the story.  Most of the song it's just his voice with piano, keyboard (violin layer effects) and violin.  The song however finishes with a beautiful flourish of chorus, violin wall of sound, piano and strong drumming. A great finale to the album of the decade!

5.1 Surround review:
The foundation and the key to 5.1 mix is the quality of the sound.  It is crisp, pure, smooth and un-compressed.  Because it is un-compressed (as all music should be), you are encouraged to turn up the volume to fully enjoy the intricacies and soft passages of the album.  The sound effects are distributed very thoughtfully across the different channels, the rear channel is used mostly for specific elements and effects as they relate to the stories of the songs, and the mix overall never feels ""gimmicky"", it's just perfect.  The other important aspect is that the quality of the album is enhanced by the energy of band playing together in recording studio - something that is quite unique and it's not done for the most part nowadays.  The 5.1 mix is way too complex to fully described here - there are way too many things going on at every single time in every song - you have to sit down and really enjoy it for yourself, but here are a few highlights:

Luminol- The flute lines moves from back to front channels, to center.  Same with some keyboards.  Movement of the flute all over the different speakers is reminiscing of 5.1 treatment of ""Tinto Brass"" in Porcupine Tree's Stupid Dream.  Steve's voice is mostly focused on the center channel while the layered vocals play in all other speakers and the people street background noise is elegantly pushed to rear channels.  Mellotron / choral effects spread over all channels for great emphasis and effect.  There is a great splash and reverb effect on some of the drums, which is not as evident in the 2.0 mix.
Drive Home - Instrumentation is beautifully balanced across all channels, highlighted by string section across all channels.  Some voice effects focus on center channel for emphasis.
The Holy Drinker - The keyboard introduction is smartly and intermittently spread through all speakers.  Again, keyboards and clarinet /flute swirl around all speakers on the initial jazzy section providing a chaotic frame of mind.  Steve voice is focused on the center channel while choral effects pummel and hit at the same time on all speakers rising the tension and sense of desperation in the song.  Wolf howl effects are mostly in the rear channel - sends chills over your spine every time you hear them.
The Pin Drop - The song has very intense moments, all channels are busy most of the time with all instrumentation except at the intro and middle ""Pink Floydian"" guitar mellow sections.
The Watchmaker - The acoustic guitars for the full half of the song are tastefully spread in front and rear speakers along with chorus.  Second half starts with percussion and guitars intertwined in all channels, giving way to finale and guitar solos that dominate the front speakers.  Piano solo brought in crescendo in front signals the finale highlighted by chorus spread across all speakers and blasting bass in the center channel.
The Raven That Refused to Sing - Steve's voice is smartly treated to enhance the emotion - focus on his pure voice on the front and center channels, with slightly echoed/reverb effects in the rear channels - it is again something that can't be fully enjoyed in a 2.0 mix.

This album will win the 2014 Grammy award for Best Surround Sound Album.  The teaming of Steven Wilson and Alan Parsons is just mind blowing and has brought back the amazing sound and quality in engineering and mixing that we used to enjoy in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Both Steven and Alan have been nominated in this category in the past, but this album will finally achieve the win for these amazing musicians/artists/engineers/producers.  Alan acts only as the engineer and co-producer on this album, but his experience and quality of work really shine.  Steven mixes both the 2.0 and 5.1 versions of the album - he has really perfected the craft of the 5.1 surround art.

The songs are absolutely amazing, complex, beautiful and performed with the highest caliber of musicianship.  Check out the videos that Kscope has released with samples of this incredible album.

The other factor that will allow The Raven that Refused to Sing and Other Stories to appeal to many more people, is the fact that the theme is centered around ghost stories, which people can't have enough of.  Steven has traditionally written songs which are very dark and touch upon topics that don't appeal to the masses.  In this album, he keeps his edge by writing beautiful songs related to very dark topics, written in a very subtle way with characters who are ghosts or involved with ghosts, but not crossing the line of the potentially creepy nature that he's had in past albums, which that potentially would have turned away some listeners.  Steven's lyrics are clean and simple, yet clever, intelligent and engaging.",1360800000,56,12013,4.78429471643238

5470190,4,B00AQB2AR4,"Day 1:  Sounds too 70's/Neo Prog, and can not find the bonus tracks.  Where did I leave  my Grace For Drowning .
Day 2: Found bonus tracks.
The song ""TRTRTS""  has the feel and sound of  Grace for Drowning and the only song that lingers like a ghost of the mind.
Track 4: A loudness factor, and I do not like skipping tracks.
Day 3: Had a bad beard day. Track 6 is the Grace for Drowning of the album. Maybe I am not ready for this album.
Day 4: Listened  to Insurgentes  and Grace For Drowning to clear my head..
Day 5: Track 3: At its core sounds like aPerfect Circle coated in The Flower Kings, and vocally sounds like Maynard Keenan of Tool and aPerfect Circle.
Anyone  who gives TRTRTS five stars ?, and anyone who gives less then three stars would be better of not  listening to the album.
To my seeing ears this sounds more like a Flower Kings album.
Day 6: To be or not to be four stars.

The Book
The deluxe earbook is an 11""x11"" 128-page hardbound book that contains the art of Hajo Mueller, the illustrator/artist and storyteller working in collaboration with Steve Wilson on this project. The track listings, lyrics and stories are included in this lavish collector's book but there are no liner notes/explanations by Wilson himself. Three ghost stories are included: Luminol (the story to accompany the song) and The Birthday Party (interestingly with no song to accompany) which were both written by Wilson and the much more extensive story to the title track song which was co-written by Mueller and Wilson. It's odd that all of the songs don't have their own ""written"" story but perhaps space was limited or perhaps the ""story"" is more evident from the lyrics. The artwork is phenomenal - quite abstract in some places - but really enhances the listening experience in my opinion. It's dark and edgy and perfectly augments what is going on with the music. From a physical format standpoint Discs 1 and 2 (the CDs) are embedded into the inside of the front cover and the DVD and Blu-ray are embedded into the inside of the rear cover. For those that have never seen one of these ear books they are quite impressive - this certainly the most extravagant one I've ever seen.

Disc 1 (The Songs)
1. Luminol (12:10)
2. Drive Home (7:37)
3. The Holy Drinker (10:13)
4. The Pin Drop (5:03)
5. The Watchmaker (11:42)
6. That Raven that Refused to Sing (7:57)

Lyrically, these songs are linked in concept yet tell 6 different ""ghost"" stories. Most of the songs deal with relationships being severed in some way, by murder of a spouse (""The Pin Drop"" and ""Watchmaker"") by death of a spouse in a car accident (""Drive Home"") and the death of a sister in the title track. The interplay of the survivor with their dead significant other seems to be the observation/theme. As with most things Wilson writes, there is much left to the listener's interpretation but for the most part the stories are more transparent lyrically than his other solo work (or PT material for that part). ""Luminol"" and ""The Holy Drinker"" deal with the spiritual issues from a slightly different approach. The former is a song about a busker who seems perform the same thing (going largely unnoticed) in both life and death. The latter song deals with a ""holy roller"" type who struggles with alcoholism and how the drinking destroys his self-imposed righteousness as he slides down the spiral path to death. While these interpretations are my own, there seems to be an exploration here into not only how we deal with those around us in everyday experience but also in the ramifications of those actions/emotions in the spiritual world/afterlife. Rather than focus on horrific images to invoke fear, anger, surprise, etc. there is an emphasis on the wretchedness and sadness of becoming complacent, or of fading away into insignificance or of forgetting the love for a spouse. It's a sobering twist on the ghost story theme indeed.

Musically, what else can be said that hasn't already been said about these songs? Steve Wilson is a musical genius and he has a way of evoking emotion and imagery from song in a way few others can in this day and age. Additionally, he knows how to surround himself with great musicians - the cohort this time his touring band from the Grace for Drowning release. The full array of prog instruments is employed for maximum effect and these songs have a dark vibe which never fails to evoke emotion. There is a certain sadness and desperation that perfectly reflects the nature of the ""story"" being told in each song. While all of these songs are fantastic I would have to say ""The Holy Drinker"" stands out for me. Musically this song is heavy, and it has everything we look for in a great prog song, and the dark descent that is portrayed at the end of the song is so ominous as to send chills down the spine. Minnemann's performance on this song is simply astounding. The other clear highlight for me would have to be the interplay of acoustic guitar, piano and vocals on the epic ""The Watchmaker."" Hear that Rush drum/bass drum jam just after the 9 and a half minute mark? On the other hand, it is a bit surprising that the title track is so short in light of the length and detail of the written story - I would have expected it to be the longest track on the release. Still, it's a haunting and fitting way - a song about dying - to end such an eclectic, entrancing and moving collection of songs.

Disc 2 (Demos)
1. Luminol (13:05)
2. Drive Home (6:57)
3. The Holy Drinker (9:47)
4. Clock Song (4:30)
5. The Pin Drop (5:15)
6. The Watchmaker (12:25)
7. The Raven that Refused to Sing (8:00)

This disc includes the demo versions of all 6 regular release songs plus one bonus track that wasn't included on the regular release. Keep in mind that this is Steve Wilson we are talking about here so the demo songs have an excellent recording quality. In essence, think of these as slightly different sounding versions of the final tracks. I would say the demo versions are every bit as engrossing and have a bit more of a live flavor to them - especially the drums which have been a bit toned back on the final songs. The bonus track ""Clock Song"" is an ambient piece about 4 and a half minutes in duration with no vocals and serves more as an interlude than an actual stand along composition. It's actually listed as an ""unused idea."" With most of the tracks, the demo versions also have a longer duration. In the end I would have to say this disc isn't essential but is nice to have as part of the total package here.

Disc 3 (DVD)
This disc only contains the 24 bit stereo, 5.1 DTS and 5.1 AC3 Dolby Audio Mixes. Bonus video is the same as on the Blu-ray (see below).

Disc 4 (Blu-ray)
The Blu-ray disc contains the 24 bit stereo and 5.1 DTS and Dolby mixes of the original 6 songs, instrumental versions of each song as well as the ""lounge"" version (it actually does sound like music one might hear sitting in a cocktail lounge) of ""Drive Home."" Sonically, the songs, of course, sound amazing on these uncompressed 5.1 mixes - the nuances create a truly spectacular listening experience that is new every time I spin these songs (and I've been listening to this for 2 years now)! The key to taking advantage of the recording quality is to play these songs at a hefty volume where you can hear all of the nuances. Also, the video during song playback scrolls slowly through the corresponding art for that song which is a very nice touch. The ""bonus"" video content includes still shots of more of Mueller's artwork - all different from the illustrations in the art book portion - photo shots from the studio and the short 20 minute studio documentary. It's a pretty generic documentary and it would have been nice to see/hear more about the origin of these songs and their meanings.

All in all, the Blu-ray clearly stands out, along with the artwork in the book as well worth the price of the package. I think that the book really enhances the listening experience and certainly hearkens back to the day when we all used to look at and study the art and lyrics while listening to our prog on the phonograph. The DVD is certainly essential for those without a Blu-ray player as this music was clearly designed to be maximally enjoyed in surround. But whether listening in surround or with headphones in stereo Wilson and friends have crafted one of the most impressive listening experiences in many years and this certainly eclipses his previous solo efforts.",1424649600,3,7614,4.6382505559673834

Several audio formats to suit your system from stereo to LPCM. I sit in the sweet spot and tell everyone not to bother me for an hour, hehe.

I've bought Just about everything Steven Wilson has been associated with. I can't say I love Bass Communion and some of the others, but PT, and his solo works are just phenomenal most of the time.

I hope he never starts writing or mixing for what the masses want to hear, because what comes out is incredible music that stands apart in the industry and among musicians.

I'm not going to do a song by song review, since there are so many. My 2 cents - If you like later PT, Deadwing, FoABP, and wish the songs on The Incident didn't feel truncated, you'll probably like this, but this certainly isn't PT. I think this is probably his best work as Steven Wilson.

Seems like every album has that one song that is a showcase of musicianship, and for me that's The Watchmaker, though the title track gets the most play.",1385164800,5,1002,4.285714285714286

The DVD-A intrigued me, as it contained a lossy surround sound version of the album, and a lossless 24-bit stereo version. The differences from the CD were enough to pique my interest, and after many hardware upgrades (hi-grade headphones, DACs, pre-amps, op-amps, you name it), I confess that owning ""hi-resolution"" music, for me, is where it's at. And after making the mistake of mastering the ""Deadwing"" album with too much loudness (rather, allowing somebody else to master it and mess it up) back in 2005, Steven has had a nearly perfect track record in offering hi-resolution, dynamic, and rich listening experiences with his products.

I will say that the production quality for Raven is just a notch below ""Grace for Drowning"" for me. It's very slightly less dynamic, though still head and shoulders above most other rock recordings released since the mid-1990s (when dynamic range took a back seat to loudness: cf. ""Loudness War"" at Wikipedia for more). GfD had warmer bass tones and a softer piano timbre. However, I do enjoy the sound of Marco's drums on Raven more than the drum sounds on GfD. The spacial separation for the cymbal crashes is wider, and the snare and toms feel like they are closer to the microphone, if that makes sense. Overall, it's enjoyable from that standpoint.

The surround sound here is absolutely phenomenal. You're missing a lot if you only listen to the stereo mix. The spacial separation between the various instruments is dazzling. There are about a dozen instances where I said ""Wow!"" out loud, having not ever heard a nuance here or there from the stereo version.

There is some filler on the BR-A. Included here Steven also gave us full instrumental versions of each song, also in hi-res audio format (24/96). Likewise there are a few surprises, like ""Clock Song,"" which was an unused idea on the album, but probably would have worked as a creepy introduction to The Watchmaker or something. There's also a comical version of ""Drive Home,"" set to a lounge music theme. I thought it was comical but then again, Steven has a very quirky sense of humor about himself, and it shows here. The song is instrumental.

Early ""demo"" versions of each song are also included on the BR-A, and they are interesting, but none drastically different from what became the final received version of the CD. For the most part, it's just production differences, where some of the instruments were mixed a bit differently, or where echo effects were used or not used, things like that. It's interesting stuff, but not too terribly essential.

Note: if you try to listen to this on your PC, you may be disappointed, as most PCs cannot decode 24-bit audio. Some sound cards do, like mine (the ASUS Xonar), and even then, the listener needs to allow the software to override the operating system's sound to get what is called ""Direct Sound"" responsiveness. Otherwise, most component BR players can support the 24/96 audio on this disc.",1370995200,2,3129,4.9073724007561434
5470245,5,B00AQB2AR4,"In the past some of Steven Wilson's non-Porcupine Tree output has been a bit rambling and somewhat pretentious. With this album, he finally hits the mark. Great arrangements, incredible musicianship from his backing band, amazing production and THE best 5.1 surround mix I have experienced to date. I got the BluRay with 5.1 but will probably also get the cd so I can listen on the road. Buy it if you are into anything from Porcupine Tree to Jethro Tull to Mahavishnu... it's that broad of a musical spectrum. Not quite rock, not quite jazz, something new, yet very much a throw back to a time when the music mattered and artists could experiment and blend genres while their audience goes along for the ride.",1370044800,,710,4.688

5470248,5,B00AQB2AR4,"Before I get to the main body of the review (which is the same as what I wrote about the CD version) I will comment on this specific version.

Steven Wilson is to me the undisputed master of surround-sound. Whether on Porcupine Tree albums such as ""Fear Of A Blank Planet"" (to me the best surround version of any album I have heard) or his work with such albums as the early King Crimson albums, he has always shown exquisite taste and creativity in utilizing the surround format. The best way to put it is that it sounds natural; you feel that you are in the center of the sound without being manipulated by gimmickry. Combining the immaculate production with the pristine high-resolution of Blu-Ray makes this the version of this album to get.

Now to the album itself.

When Steven Wilson launched his ""solo"" career (not counting the very earliest Porcupine Tree albums which were really solo albums under the PT name) with ""Insurgentes"", it seemed that it was primarily a way for him to explore styles that would not fit into the PT mold/expectations; certainly the release of PT's ""The Incident"" did not seem to indicate that his main interests might move elsewhere. The second solo album, ""Grace For Drowning"", could also have been looked at the same way. But then Wilson started talking of PT as, while not dead, certainly being on an indefinite hiatus; and the effort that went into the GFD tour, culminating in the ""Get All You Deserve"" DVD, started to put his solo career in a different light. So when Wilson stated that he was now writing music with the GFD tour musicians, and their capabilities, in mind, and the possible PT resumption was pushed farther and farther into a hazy future, it seemed quite clear that his primary concentration was now in this new space; and ""The Raven That Refused To Sing"" presents musical evidence of this to where an official announcement seems unnecessary. This is the work of a musician who is inspired, focused, and reinvigorated - and confident in being so. A token of that confidence is the confidence he puts in the band - the songs were recorded live in the studio; and while some overdubbing took place, if you have been to any of the live performances on the ""Raven"" tour it is apparent that  those overdubs are grace notes - what you hear is organically the band.

The tone for the new direction is set with ""Luminol"", which debuted on the later legs of the GFD tour, and was included on GAYD. The theme of reimagining the classic progressive rock of the 70's (about which more will be said at the end of this review) that was introduced on GFD with tracks such as the King Crimson-influenced ""Raider II"" is immediately made clear, with a bass and drum intro straight out of the classic Yes era; a brief vocal break brings to mind ""Close To The Edge"" or ""Tempus Fugit"". But that this is not simply a tribute is driven home in the playing of keyboardist Adam Holzman (for me the heart of this band), whose affected and non-affected electric piano takes the arrangement straight into fusion territory (Theo Travis' excellent wind instruments are also major contributors to this leaning throughout the album). While Guthrie Govan's guitar is more of a supporting instrument here, where he is featured he shows a confidence (there's that word again) and an aggressiveness that neither Aziz Ibrahim nor Niko Tsanev were willing or able to bring on the GFD tours. A very Crimsonish mellotron-led section (using the original Crimson mellotron, by the way) leads into a recapitulation of the first section of the song that brings the entirety to a powerful and satisfactory conclusion (it is in this last section that we hear how Govan's playing adds so much more than the previous guitarist who played the song).

""Drive Home"" follows; a ballad that would have sounded a bit different, but not out of place in the mid-period (""Stupid Dream""/""Lightbulb Sun"") PT. Here Wilson shows how he can turn a musically-simple composition into an emotionally evocative and moving song. The use of an actual string section to augment the keyboards is handled with perfect balance and taste. Here is where Govan first steps out with a guitar solo that is beautifully melodic, with just enough of a sonic edge to set it both apart and consonant with the backing strings/keyboards.

""The Holy Drinker"" (which to me is the best track on the album) follows, with an intro that combines guitar, mini-moog, and sax in the best fusion manner. Wilson has said that he was thinking of the early Mahavishnu Orchestra when he wrote this section; and while I wouldn't say it sounds exactly like Mahavishnu, that band's position as one of the founders of fusion make the comparison apt. The vocal/""song"" section that follows shows how Wilson has refined his ""heavier"" sound in a way that shows how he has taken his ""metal"" period  (which I loved - I still think ""Fear Of A Blank Planet"" is one of rock's all-time great albums) into something much more than pure guitar riffing.  The fusion sound returns, led again by Travis' sax and flute and Holzman's piano, culminating in a Hammond organ-like crescendo that invokes past prog but without going overboard. A spacy section that once again would not have sounded out-of-place conceptually in old PT unexpectedly transforms back into the metal-influenced sound, here sounding like, as the lyrics portray, something right out of hell itself, while eschewing noise-for-noise's-sake. A truly impressive track in all ways.

Next comes ""The Pin Drop"". This was the track it took me the longest to get into; Wilson stretches his voice into a range that seems to teeter on the edge of cracking, but holds together. Acoustic guitar and piano break into a chorus of layered vocals driven by Marco Minneman's drumming, with Travis' sax again pushing the sound into something more than rock. The tension builds, only to be released with a deceptively simple vocal section - only to suddenly turn back into driving tension, with Govan's guitar now taking the lead, anchoring the sound back into the rock universe, with an ending that seems to leave the entirety suspended in mid-air; but in doing so avoids what would be a clichd ending were it to come back down from the intensity.

""The Watchmaker"" shows its classic prog roots even more than ""Luminol""; the combination of the acoustic guitars, flute, and vocals transports you back into classic-era Genesis, but with a lyrical restraint that Genesis ignored, often to its detriment. Yet even though it goes through several changes from section to section, it hangs together, making the transitions sound both fluid and natural. Again, a combination of Travis and Govan push an uptempo section forward, only to resolve back to a low-key yet complex vocal section somewhat reminiscent of ""Every Home Is Wired"" on PT's ""Signify"". The last section calls forth the demonic feeling of the ending of ""The Holy Drinker"" without sounding at all like a simple repeat of that song. Again, if you have seen the show, you know just how powerful it comes across live; yet that power shines through even on the album. This is another song that seems to grow with repeated listening.

Finally comes the title track, ""The Raven That Refused To Sing"". The very simple piano underpinning immediately brings to mind ""Get All You Deserve"" from ""Insurgentes""; but instead of resolving into a barrage of noise, it remains melodic and plaintive, musically and lyrically. This is another song that would not have sounded out of place in mid-period PT, and could be considered this album's answer to ""Stop Swimming"". As with ""Drive Home"" Wilson shows how much emotion can come out of the understated. While on most of the album the lyrics are a bit elliptical, to the point where you really need to read one of Wilson's interviews to get the full idea of the stories he is trying to tell, here the full impact of the tale comes through, while still avoiding unnecessary wordiness. For one last time Wilson shows how a song can build to a climax without bombast. It's a sad and sweet ending that leaves you with a haunting feeling that reflects the concept of the entire album.

I mentioned early on the idea of the album as a reimagining of classic 70's prog, with nods to Wilson's own prior output. Some reviewers have said that he wears his influences too much on his sleeve, and have criticized the album as not really original. This is a legitimate question to raise. One could say that ""The Pin Drop"" is the closest thing to an original sound on the album, and the other songs could be looked at (maybe a bit cynically?) as ""spot the riff"". However, one could as easily say that every blues-based song is a rewriting of those that went before. I look at it it this way: if ""Luminol"" is Yes and ""The Watchmaker"" is Genesis, does it take those roots and utilize them in a way that expands and extends them in a new and modern way; and does it do it well? I would say to both questions the answer is an unqualified affirmative. Do we dismiss Tchaikovsky's symphonies because Beethoven wrote symphonies first? (Not that I'm comparing Yes and Wilson to Beethoven and Tchaikovsky in the absolute, but in a rock context one can use the analogy.) Wilson has taken classic prog and made it both relevant and exciting in a way no other current musician has. The musicianship and production are absolutely first-rate, and the songs are simultaneously challenging, catchy, and stand up on repeated (and repeated and repeated) listening. The album certainly earns its five-star rating.",1369094400,4,9564,4.789090909090909

5470250,5,B00AQB2AR4,"This is simply amazing. It's much more creative and pensive than the porcupine tree stuff and Steven's found his own niche for sure.  This is his best one yet.  I normally expect quality to go down with quantity, this didn't seem to take him very long, but it's pure perfection.  The separation and mix is astounding as usual.

5470261,5,B00AQB2AR4,"I rarely write reviews, but with this one I felt compelled.

I have been a Steven Wilson/""Porcupine Tree"" fan for some time. This solo effort by Steven is the best I've heard from him, or ""Porcupine Tree"", since The ""Tree's"", ""Fear of a Blank Planet""! The writing is very well done. The musicianship of the players is top notch (and the players are all notables). It seems Steven has gleamed a bit from all the ""King Crimson"" remastering he has done, and put it all together for us to enjoy on this disc.

  I have only listened to the surround format, but as per usual, it is produced extremely well (with a bit of extra help from Alan Parsons). I listened to the disc twice, back to back, before venturing into the extras, and I had a hard time not spinning it a third go round (but it was getting late)!

  With some lush soundscapes, interlaced with technically intricate passages, this has everything a jazz/prog rock boy could want.
This latest effort is certainly on the top of my listening rotation.

Wonderfully written, arranged, performed and recorded, Steven has really outdone himself here with the help of Alan Parsons and a band of stellar musicians.
Sounds amazing (like many others here, I bought the Blu-ray and CD versions) and has some really neat liner art as well.
I too have listened to it repeatedly and am still floored by it.
I too hope this band continues to make music together.

After hearing this in 5.1, I'm starting to acquire as many PT albums as possible in surround (got The Incident, FOABP is next).

When I read that he used the original KC Mellotron, thought it would not be any different from the sampled versions, but it's like night and day!

I enjoy multichannel audio and this does not disappoint. Quite the contrary, this is an amazing sounding disc.

All of the tracks held my attention, there is so much going on. One would never tire of repeated listenings, it is that good.
The title track is my favorite. It takes me to that place where only an incredibly wonderful piece of music can. There is a violin riff accompanied by softer, understated guitar and piano towards the ending that I could loop for hours on end.
Going out on a limb here a bit: for musicians, you know how you feel emotionally recharged after playing, when it's one of those days when all the riffs, all of the patterns and chords are perfect, when you can't hit a bad note?

Insurgentes was nice but not spectacular. Grace For Drowning was my unexpected album of the year for 2011. The Raven...is something else entirely. I think I might be a ""fan-boy"" now...

I have a ridiculous amount of music at my disposal...literally hundreds of albums I have waiting for my first full listen, not to mention over 70,000 songs between my computer and my cd/record/cassette collection. Somehow, I can't seem to find time for them.

The Raven demands to be heard, almost daily, preferably in Blu-Ray surround. When I stand in the heart of that perfect musical storm of surround sound, I find my whole body moving, almost involuntarily, to the music. I find myself singing along and smiling with pure musical excitement. When I am lost in the title track, I am moved, sometimes to tears, by the sad story and the simplistic beauty of the music (which still allows the band to shine within its' framework).

I have been exposed to much great music in my nearly 45 years. Some have stood the test of time better than others. Within just a few weeks The Raven...has become a sure desert island disc. I am still surprised at how much I love this album. It moves my body and spirit from start to finish.

I love the album and Steven's influences are all evident in this original homage that makes it all seem fresh and relevant. With the Mellotron and Moog (especially on ""Holy Drinker"") I definitely think of King Crimson and ELP. The opening of ""Luminol"" reminds me a bit of Yes' ""Drama"" period (""Tempest Fugit""?) and ""The Watchmaker"" has shades of Genesis. And the whole album reminds me of Alan Parsons' debut, ""Tales of Mystery & Imagination,"" a thematic album with all tracks based on Edgar Alan Poe stories. These songs remind me of that and his lyrics are not the least bit Tolkien (There Steven, I said it for you!). I love the music and knowing the stories behind each track makes me appreciate the lyrics even more. The band is fantastic and the 5.1 mix on the Blu-ray lives up to Wilson's reputation. The album certainly isn't breaking any new ground, but what it is doing covers the best of the old ground beautifully. I recently read an interview where Steven said that he hopes that his fans ""get"" his new work. As an older fan (I'm a decade older than Steven) I can honestly say that a lot folks like me are very happy that HE gets it. Thank you for this gift!",1362700800,5,1424,4.414448669201521

I have to give kudos to him from a sound / engineering standpoint. Wilson puts forth some of the best quality mixes and HD stuff available today. This is no exception. If you have the system get the Blu Ray. Drink a few beers and crank it. Pick your poison HD 5.1 or Stereo 96/24. It sounds great.

There's also some good quality written music here. Just ain't my cup of tea as much as the harder rocking PT. If you like his previous solo efforts then you'll really like this. If like me you like the PT better you'll be wishing for a little less mellow at times. There's definitely some 70's prog influence going on here. But at times it seems a bit unfinished. Some excellent musicianship. Though I miss Gavin.

Might grow on me. At least I want to listen to this as opposed to his previous solo work. Maybe he's maturing. Or maybe I am.",1362614400,12,1068,4.33

I will only say listening on Blu-Ray on my Home Theater was an epic audio experience. Not only is this the best sounding audio performance I've heard in a home , the music itself is extraordinary ..for this listener its sheer genius. Stunning! Simply Stunning!",1362182400,,362,4.761904761904762
5470296,5,B00AQB2AR4,"After getting this a couple of days ago, it is now one of my very favorite albums of all time!

The sound quality is outstanding.

I too, like so many others, wish the Blu-Ray package had come with a CD or MP3 download.

Still, I'd buy this again with no hesitation if I didn't already have it or  if I somehow lost it.",1362182400,2,319,4.015873015873016
5470297,5,B00AQB2AR4,"This is a masterpiece from someone who is setting the pace in musical creativity over the past two decades. Steven just keeps creating not only great music, but keeps elevating the bar on sonic quality like no one else can.

In this album, engineered by the legendary Alan Parson and mixed by Steven, the richness and depth of sound are astounding. Dynamic range is huge, and the 5.1 high-rez lossless surround mix is spectacular on my rig (which itself is an homage to Mr. Wilson, as that's what it takes to appreciate his recordings to the max).

The BluRay edition is the one to get if you want to hear all that is in these recordings.
Thankfully, it features multiple mixes and formats all on one disc. So you get 24/96 LPCM Stereo mix for all you 2ch afficiondos.
Us surround-heads get both a 5.1 24/96 LPCM and a DTS-HD MasterAudio lossless 24/96 5.1 encoding as well.

A must own album just for the music, and absolutely a go-to demo disc to show off all your system can do.",1362182400,5,981,4.4692737430167595
5470298,5,B00AQB2AR4,"You can look at lots of other reviews of the album to get a detailed review of the music. I am a long-time fan of progressive music, especially experimental rock and jazz-rock fusion, going back to the early '70s. If you have similar tastes, then this album is likely to push all the right buttons for you.

If, however, you think that music should be the backing track for some other activity, i.e. you are not the kind of person who sits down in front of your sound system with the expressed and sole purpose of LISTENING to the music...then this album may not be for you. There is a lot of musical complexity of all sorts that would be quite distracting if not outright unpleasant if you were trying to do something requiring attention while listening.

Please note that I don't think that anyone is a ""better"" or ""worse"" person if they do or do not do this. We active listeners are the ""lefties"" of the music appreciation world, so you have to forgive us when we get all gushed-out about an entire album that we can LISTEN to from end-to-end without getting tired or bored. This is one of THOSE albums.

I want to specifically point out the Blu-Ray. Steven Wilson has demonstrated time and again that he understands 5.1 channel audio for MUSIC as-well-or-better-than anyone else in the business. Listen to his brilliant surround production work on the 5.1 PT albums, or on the re-release of Jethro Tull's ""Thick as a Brick"". This album is all that. The surround usage is not gimicky or distracting. The sound stage is enormous and completely envelopes you. Instruments come from everywhere and nowhere. The stereo version of the album is just as wonderful musically, but sounds primitive in comparison production-wise.

You folks who use your home theaters only for movies and perhaps to apply surround ""effects"" to stereo recordings are really missing out. Hearing well-done 5.1 mixes of albums up against their stereo counterparts is even more profound a difference in experience than hearing stereo recordings up against their monophonic counterparts.",1362096000,26,2058,4.854700854700854
5470299,5,B00AQB2AR4,"Steven Wilson can seem to do no wrong and this release is no different. There is the obvious genesis influence throughout and there is nothing wrong with that!  I purchased the Blu Ray and couldn't be more blow away by first the music and then the sonics. This Blu Ray release is stunning to hear and in the normal brilliance of Steven Wilson knowing how to use each speaker for a complete surround sound experience that is second to none.

Everything in place here and very recommended!",1362009600,2,487,4.586206896551724
5470300,5,B00AQB2AR4,"This review is in reference to the blu ray,and vinyl(2 disc,heavy vinyl-33rpm).The dvd has a few extras,a 20min""making of""(cool; in shimmering B&W))and the 5:1mix is out of this world. The vinyl(which Im listening to at this moment)is silky smooth and 98%noise free,REALLY nice! No extras tho. Fave cuts are ""The Watchmaker,The Holy Drinker and the title cut. Theres a cool video of the Raven....on you tube that should be played along while listening to this,its awesome made by the same guy who did Drag Ropes(Storm Corrosion).This stuff is heavily influenced by 70s prog(I especially hear alot of early Genesis)and it is fricken awesome .Got my tickets for May 3rd at The Park West-; and boy I cant wait! No Marco but Chad Wackerman aint exactly chopped liver! The bass is really out front on this too. All the band really shines!!!This release is All that I hoped for.",1362009600,2,872,4.898648648648648

8556335,5,B00AQB2AR4,"It is not my type of progressive rock - kind of pessimistic comparing to the usual recordings I like to listen. But it is definitely a masterpice, thus I didn't remove any stars - my personal preference has nothing to do with the value of the product. Sound quality is pretty good, not as perfect as on Roger Waters "" Amused to Death"" SACD (Grammy award for multichannel recording in2016), but still good.
 I need a special sad mood to listen to this recording, but when I listen to it, my mood improves.",1483660800,,504,4.419354838709677
