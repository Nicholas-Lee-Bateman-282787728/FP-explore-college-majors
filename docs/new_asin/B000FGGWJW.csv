2565119,4,B000FGGWJW,"As a fan of 'Keeping Up Appearances' I was eager to see this series.  It is great for fans of Patricia Routledge.  Be prepared for the fact that this is not the typical TV detective show.  Many times the outcome is a bit of a disappointment because the solutions are not all neat and tidy.  However, it is a welcome change from the 'guns and mayhem' type shows.",1402099200,,361,4.264705882352941
2565120,5,B000FGGWJW,"Hetty was determined to account for something in her mature years. She and spouse, Robert, 40 yr wed, sometimes get crotchety, then make up. Robert helps his wife in her Wainthropp Detective Agency. Geoffrey, now young adult, assists, and is in love with Janet. Crime without gritty, dark, bloody scenes, but it does have the rare but quick crime action. Expect plenty of humor. Wainthropp & team is heartwarming.

Regulars: Hetty Wainthropp (Patricia Routledge -`Keeping Up Appearances'); Robert (Derek Benfield -loved him in the early days of `Rumpole of the Bailey'); Geoffrey (Dominic Monaghan -`Lord of the Rings'); DCI Adams (John Graham-Davies); Girlfriend Janet (Suzanne Maddock -`The Bill'). Tons of seasoned guest stars.

Closed Captioning for all episodes. Just a few guest stars highlighted below.
1- Something to Treasure -Miner's widow Moira (Lesley Dunlop -`South Riding' `Emmerdale') has Hetty searching for the miners' treasure. A showering Geoffrey shows his back-side for 2 seconds. Another guest star is Robert Perkins (`The Bill').
2- Family Values -Was Harry's (Tom Georgeson -`bleak House' `G.B.H.') brother James (Hugh Dickson -`Poldark') murdered by Ella (Dinah Stabb)? Hetty and team investigate the housemaid.
3- Digging for Dirt -Enid (Jean Heywood) will not leave the condemned flat, a substandard tenement built by G. Gregson (Keith Barron). A son asks the agency to persuade Enid.
4- Mind over Muscle --Hetty's hairdresser (Kate Lonergan) wants to know why her spouse was beaten up in a pub by a stranger.
5- Blood Relations -Kirkwell village cousin visit turns to instigation of the growling Devil dog. Robert tackles his own case for his newspaper column. Geoffrey helps Heety; Janet aids Robert. Guest stars: Sheila Burrell (`Jane Eyre'); Jean Rimmer; & Nicholas Lamont (`Pie in the Sky').
6- For Love nor Money -- Robert's brother Frank (Frank Mills) asks Hetty to find his old sweetheart's (Gillian Raine -`Wish Me Luck') kid Marianne (Aline Mowat -`Politician's Wife'). Branagan played by Gawn Grainger. Seemed primed for a 5th season, but alas, this is the end of a delightful 4-season run of a great investigative drama/humor series.

2565124,5,B000FGGWJW,"I have all the Hetty Wainthropp series.  All are enjoyable and keep your attention.  Patricia Routledge is a great actress; she went from ""Hyacinth Bucket"" to ""Hetty Wainthropp"" flawlessly.  When you watch this series, take note of all her hats!  Supporting cast are terrific in their parts, too!",1296777600,2,296,5.104166666666667
2565125,5,B000FGGWJW,"The reason I have been purchasing the Hetty Wainwright series is I enjoy seein g
Patricia Rutledge in a different type of character. I remember her from the movie
""To Sir With Love"" in 1967, never thinking that she would break out as Hyacinth
Bucket. Now another chance to see her adapt to this investigator who runs this business with the family. I tend to stay loyal to those I am lucky enough to see earlier in their careers. And Miss Rutledge hasn't disappointed me throught the years with any cast ensemble she is with.

8122333,5,B000FGGWJW,"After four years of quirky human-interest cases solved with her much improved assistant Jeff, ""Hetty Wainthropp Investigates"" came to an end.  It's worth reflecting how different life is for the Wainthropp Detective Agency at the end of this series: Jeff has gone from a teenage delinquent in the first ever episode to a responsible, decent (but still street smart) young man with a steady girlfriend living independent of Hetty (but still her partner in deduction).  The cases in this last run are just as unique as the ones before, and not as complicated as the ones from the previous series.  There's hidden loot and strained relationships in a mining community in ""Something to Treasure"".  ""Family Values"" starts with Hetty doing some background digging on the too-good housekeeper of a wealthy dead man, and ends up with Hetty solving her one and only murder of the entire show!  ""Digging for Dirt"" sees Hetty take a stand with a firebrand older woman over bureaucratic tyrants trying to demolish a housing complex.  In ""Mind Over Muscle"", Jeff finally leaves the Wainthropp home and moves in with his girlfriend carried over from series 3, Janet.  ""Blood Relations"" sees an impromptu investigation of strange occurrences that disturb an old woman while Hetty visits her long-lost cousin in a seaside town in Yorkshire.  The last episode has Hetty tracking down another missing person, and ends on a sweet note with the Wainthropps, Jeff, and Janet having dinner in a nice restaurant, a gentle but inconclusive way to end this unique show.
Patricia Routledge will always be known as the insufferable Hyacinth... but she has many fans who remember her fondly as Hetty from this remarkable, gentle, phenomenally original show about a woman who faced ubiquity as a pensioner but found her true calling as a watchdog of justice for the common folk.  No case was too small or too odd for her and her reliable Geoffrey to tackle.  This distinctly odd couple (a matronly housewife and a teenage delinquent) show us that out of our own miserable, unfortunate situations, we can find something greater and become better people.",1406160000,,2123,5.005681818181818
