It would be a great video if he dropped all the 'don't do this' stuff and just concentrated on what to do.  I was going to just mute the bad stuff, but it's inter-weaved throughout so I had to stop watching.  It's too bad, because I liked him quoting the greats & then showing actual footage of the greats.  I hope they do a revision with just what to do, and not include what not to do.",1370044800,4,661,3.984848484848485
