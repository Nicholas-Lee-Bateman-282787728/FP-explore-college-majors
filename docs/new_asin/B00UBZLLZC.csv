7035707,5,B00UBZLLZC,"I bought this as a Father's Day gift, along with season 1 and 2.  It is a better guide to parenting than all those self-help books out there.  This gentle, realistic series touches the heart and also makes you laugh.  We are going to have a weekly viewing evening, one show at a time.  The stories still ring true.  It is a pleasure to watch The Wonder Years again.",1433289600,,365,4.231884057971015
7035708,5,B00UBZLLZC,"What a great show... it's expensive, but, Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, The Jimi Hendrix Estate, and many others got behind
the show and allowed their original songs to appear as originally aired. I'm glad that these are being released by season.
There ARE some songs that got substituted with others, but---like ""WKRP Cincinnati"" without their original songs... it
just isn't the same. The first go-round, without THE songs made it WKRAP Cincinnati.

Listen! SOME complain that the video quality is a little soft. I read that the producers PAID a neighbor to cut their palm
tree down because it was SUPPOSED to be set in The Midwest. The video softness is there to make the episodes look
more like old photographs in an album... it'd've been TOO expensive-----in the long run-----to have vintage automobiles
and props... especially outdoors.

I have a HUGE widescreen television; that Interstate in a few backgrounds has automobiles that throw you back out of the

Trailer

There are plenty of coming of age stories, but the classics for me are still Stand by Me and A Christmas Story in film, and The Wonder Years on TV.  In each, you get the full impact of adolescence, but with a terrific sense of the time period, along with plots that bring everything into sharp focus. The Wonder Years is funny, its fresh, its thought provoking, it insightfully and colorfully captures the attitudes of the era, and it plays well 20 years later.

Like Leave It to Beaver, the series episodes were seen from the point of view of an adolescent, and you knew you were in for an interesting ride when this half-hour comedy-drama shunned a laugh track and introduced the kind of voiceover narrator that we got in A Christmas Storyan adult version of the main character, who was 12 years old when the series began. And you knew that The Wonder Years would meet the 60s head-on when the pilot called for the girl-next-doors older brother to be killed in Vietnam, and for our hero to comfort her in a scene that would culminate in a first kiss for each of themboth as characters, and as actors.

In short, The Wonder Years gets it right. Kids Kevins age were too young to worry about a draft number, yet too old to ignore the events that were shaping history and the lives of Americansthings like the Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy assassinations, the moon landing, Woodstock, the Apollo 13 crisis, and events that were an outgrowth of Civil Rights, womens liberation, and increasingly strident anti-war protests. The result is a series that combines the innocence of childhoodof who likes whom, and passing noteswith a world thats pushing them to grow up more quickly.

Fred Savage was perfectly cast as Kevin Arnold, who at 13 became the youngest actor ever nominated for a Primetime Outstanding Lead Actor for a Comedy Series Emmy. His doe eyes reflected innocence, while his impish smile was a sign that he might say or do something impulsive or mischievous at any moment. The girl next door, Winnie Cooper, was also well cast, with Danica McKellar perfect as someone who would be both a best friend and love interest over the course of the shows six seasons. And for comic relief and guy-to-guy matters there was bespectacled Paul (Josh Saviano), a brainy pal who was also Kevins best friend. The tone was wink-wink one minute and woe-is-me another as this group navigated the halls of junior high, then high school and all of the problems that seem so major to this age group: crushes, dates, tormentors, cliques, and run-ins with teachers and coaches.

On the home front, older brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) was obviously fond of his brother but lived to torment him, while much older sister Karen (Olivia dAbo) was so caught up in the 60s that she was a flower child from the very first episode. The parents were especially well cast, with Dan Lauria returning from work each day grumpy and feeling chewed up and spat out, and Alley Mills deferring to him while also trying to act as mediator when he got on the kids.

Mr. Arnold swears almost as much as the dad from A Christmas Story, but without the mumbling. For him, hell and damn are normal everyday words. Many dads were like that, especially when the country seemed to be coming apart at the seams. But while historical events provided a backdrop, like the terrific music from the period that we hear in every episode, this show was still about growing up, and growing up in the 60s and early 70s was more complicated. The Wonder Years managed to capture the perfect storm of events that were always in a familys consciousness even as the father tried to put food on the table, siblings fought and sought to find their place in the world, and the mother tried to hold them all together.

If your family is into binge-watching, The Wonder Years is a perfect candidate, and you don't have to begin with Season 1. This season Kevin meets an older girl during summer vacation, butts heads with an unreasonable teacher, tries to help Winnie get over her stage fright when they're all in a play together, takes a break from best-pal Paul, gets his first pimple, learns a lesson about cheating, sabotages himself on a test, joins a band, gets a dog, struggles in glee club, builds a treehouse with his dad, and has to deal with an awkward moment when he and Winnie are invited to a make-out party. And brainy Paul develops a crush on Mrs. Arnold. Meanwhile, the Apollo 13 astronauts are in trouble and Kevin worries that his family is also in trouble, with a sister trying to enroll in a liberal college and his father complaining about the old house so much that Kevin is afraid they might move away from his friends and school.

7035710,5,B00UBZLLZC,"The Wonder Years originally aired from 1988 to 1993. The adult Kevin Arnold (offscreen narrator Daniel Stern) reminisces on his teen years growing up during the late 60s and early 70s. As he goes from adolescence to adulthood, he experiences, along with best friend Paul and sometimes girlfriend Winnie, the range of trials and traumas that occur in almost everyones life.

In The Wonder Years: Season Three, the Arnold family takes a vacation to Ocean City, which was the site of Jack and Normas honeymoon. Paul (Josh Saviano) joins them, but the vacation turns out to be a disaster, with Paul getting car sick, getting badly sunburned, and developing an allergic reason to fish he ate. Kevin (Fred Savage) gets his first French kiss during this otherwise awful family vacation. Once back in school, Kevin goes to his first make-out party. Cars become a focus of the show when Kevins older brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) gets his drivers license and his dad (Dan Lauria) sells the old family station wagon to buy a snappier car. Kevin has a brush with rock n roll stardom after new kid Larry Beeman (Joshua Miller) gets the Electric Shoes up and running. Juliette Lewis guest stars as  Waynes girlfriend, Delores.

7035712,5,B00UBZLLZC,"Everyone's Favorite Nostalgic Dramedy Series is back with a full season of 23 episodes!!!! which by the way is as many episodes that we had in season 1 (6) and season 2 (17) put together. Someone at Starvista can't count because on the back cover it states 'This DVD set contains all 17 episodes from Season 3, in their original broadcast version, there really are 23 episodes, they're listed on each of the 4 discs. Plus also included is a 24 page booklet with full episode guides and many other features.
Plus over 50 songs as they were featured in the original broadcasts by The Beach Boys, James Taylor,The Who,The Righteous Brothers,James Brown,The Byrds, Jackie Wilson and many others.

Some of the best moments this season involve Jack Arnold's interactions with Kevin, Norma, Karen and Grandpa. Dan Lauria is priceless, a comic genius, his expressions remind me of Ralph Kramden, and he does a darn good impression of him in the episode where Grandpa Arnold comes to visit. There are some real heartbreakers, like when Jack and Karen come to disagreements on her birthday. And Winnie Cooper is stunningly beautiful this year. This third season had some exceptional episodes *****

7035739,5,B00UBZLLZC,"The Wonder Years:  An incredible SIX SEASON series about a young boy named Kevin Arnold played by Fred Savage (narrated by Daniel Stern).  During the poignant times of the social and political times during the 60's and 70's  The series is done from Kevin's ADULT point of view and narrated through Daniel Stern.

Jack is Kevin's hardworking (albeit noisy and quite moody) father.  Norma (the most unappreciated) yet most loving mom ever, Wayne is his horribly gross, obnoxious brother... and Kevin has a cool but hippy (thankless and at times reckless) sister Karen.  Winnie, his sometimes girlfriend and his best friend Paul.

Highly recommend this series!  One of my favorites!

7035740,5,B00UBZLLZC,"This 1989-90 season of ""The Wonder Years"" resulted in its highest ratings ever: the 8th most popular show on TV.  At a time of sitcom dominance (seven of the top nine shows) ""The Wonder Years"" was the second highest-rated on ABC, behind only ""Roseanne.""  This represented a significant bounce-back after its Season 2 ratings slump when it wound up in a tie for 22nd place.  I enjoyed Season 2, but as I pointed out in my five-star review of the DVD, there were a couple of problems which I think were reflected in the ratings.  Season 3 is right in the pocket all the way, and we can see why it was the most successful full season of the series.

Season 3 tells the story of Kevin Arnold's (Fred Savage) year in eighth grade (1969-70).  It has its quirky moments, but nothing that goes out too far on a limb - and that includes the brilliantly quirky ""Tree House"" episode, which (shall I say) branched off in a delightfully unpredictable direction.

Older brother Wayne's (Jason Hervey) tormenting is toned down this season (I wrote that excessive bullying and weirdness was a problem in Season 2), and the result is both the best comic pay-off (the lurching car scene) and the best character pay-off thus far in the series for Wayne, as we come to understand some of his very believable middle-child frustrations.  Beneath all the derision directed toward Kevin, it begins to become clear that he really cares about his brother.  Juliette Lewis guest-appears memorably in a few episodes as Wayne's gum-chomping bimbo girlfriend Delores (definitely not the same as the Delores from a notorious ""Seinfeld"" episode""!).

Hippie-ish older sister Karen (Olivia D'Abo), as a high school senior with leaving her ""bourgeois"" home for college on her mind, continues to assert her independence, leading to unavoidable conflict with her hard-working, minimally-communicative Korean War-vet father (Dan Lauria, as Jack Arnold), as well as to an emotional resolution of their generation-gap issues in the ""Daddy's Little Girl"" episode.  Alley Mills (as Norma Arnold/Mom) is stellar in the ""Faith"" episode, in which her losing the year's tax receipts reveals the true extent to which she is the glue that holds the family together.

But mostly it's about Kevin and best friends Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano) and Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) as they navigate their way through junior high school and the mounting pressures (particularly social) of eighth grade.  The back-to-back episodes ""She, My Friend and I"" and ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre,"" are pivotal in the inevitably changing nature of Kevin and Winnie's relationship.

In a bonus-feature interview Jason Hervey talks about the music being an absolutely essential element in the telling of the ""Wonder Years"" story.  Now with nearly all (96%) of the licensing rights to the originally-featured music obtained, the series feels complete on DVD.  There is almost an embarrassment of musical riches, but from this season I'll just mention three particularly effective uses of 1960s recordings: 1) The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" in the opening ""Summer Song"" family-vacation-at-the-seashore episode; 2) the comedic use of James Brown's ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"" and Jewel Akens' ""The Birds and the Bees"" in the aforementioned ""Tree House"" episode; and especially 3) the powerfully affecting appearances of the Motown ballads ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" (Jimmy Ruffin) and ""You're All I Need to Get By"" (Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell) in the most emotionally charged moments between Kevin and Winnie in the unforgettable ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" episode.

The bonus features are extensive and illuminating (with no shortage of intelligent, in-depth observations) AND we get the answer (from one of the producers) as to how in the world Wayne's repeatedly addressing his brother as ""Scrote"" was able to get past the network censors.  The only drawback with this extra material is that it covers the entire series, so there are spoilers all over the place.  And alas, there is no episode commentary.

Saving the best for last, I will mention that this is the season that includes what is possibly the greatest three-episode story arc in network half-hour-series TV history: Episodes 2, 9 and 20 (""Math Class,"" ""Math Class Squared"" and ""Good-Bye"").  The third of this trilogy earned Emmy awards for writing (Bob Brush) and directing (Michael Dinner), while the late Steven Gilborn was robbed of one for his acting portrayal of Mr. Collins, the no-nonsense, uncompromised-standards-upholding, ""old-school"" algebra teacher who believed that ""every problem contains its own solution.""  Kevin would be changed forever (for the better) by having been his student.  (Gilborn in real life held a Ph. D. in literature and had been a college professor before becoming an actor.)

This is a season to cherish in one of American television's finest series",1436140800,9,4931,5.158092848180678
