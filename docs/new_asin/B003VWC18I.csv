8407143,5,B003VWC18I,"So much story telling packed into 39 minutes and it was more complete and satisifying than many of the full length films Hollywood has been cranking out lately. It's obvious Anders has experienced true grief in his life and that translated to the screen however this was far from a depressing film. In fact, it was truly uplifting.
It was also a nice change to see Zlatko Buric in a role where he wasn't the villain or a character of questionable intent. Zlatko is a very talented actor who some of you might recall from the Pusher Trilogy (Denmark), Dirty Pretty Things (UK) and 2012 (US/Canada). I hope to see more of his work soon.

This film is definitely worth seeing and I think Anders Osterballe is definitely a director to keep an eye on for future work.",1282435200,,762,4.521739130434782
