3765433,3,B001QJ73J0,"In this package there were four movies. The best was the ""Two Champions of Shaolin""! This made it all worth it! This was a classic SB Chop-Socky. Everything you want in a Kung-Fu flick! Strange weapons. Murder. Betrayal. Plots and sub plots. Out of sync voices. bad hair pieces. Lots of blood. Spraying spinal fluid! Wild ending mass fight scene! Shaw brothers at their best. Get this one. I won't mention the rest.

I give it three stars on the strength of the above mentioned movie. You might like the rest, but I didn't.",1383436800,6,523,4.5638297872340425

3765436,2,B001QJ73J0,"Shaw Brothers Collection
I just bough this collection set, I was so happy to watch them but I got disappointed because the language is not English. It is only in Chinese, it has subtitles, but who wants to read while your enjoying the movie.

3765441,5,B001QJ73J0,"I like all martial art movies that are  in english,and not sub title in engilsh print. All 4 movies were clear.",1290988800,5,111,4.285714285714286
3765442,3,B001QJ73J0,"Some of the movies in this set were better than others.  Forget about the plots, the stories, the background settings, they are absolutely terrible in that regard. But then the awful storylines and dialog are all just a vehicle for delivering some of the best choreographed martial arts combat scenes ever crafted. If you like excellently filmed and pefectly timed fight scenes, this set does not disappoint. Some of the fights are pure fantasy, impossible in the real world, but very entertaining to watch regardless.
