My dad is in his 70's and has PHN to his face (trigeminal nerve) and it is a terrible thing, also bad to see it and not be able to help. So gave this DVD a shot for peace of mind to look for anything new that we could try. The movie provides good details on the disease, few testimonials of patients with PHN, but at the end of the day, nothing we have not tried yet (medicine like). We know about surgical procedures to sever the nerve, but a path he decided to be too aggressive, specially because it could end with bad consequences instead of benefits.",1380844800,,706,4.356060606060606
