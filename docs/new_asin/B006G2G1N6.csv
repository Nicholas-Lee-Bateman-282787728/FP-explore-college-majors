8497362,5,B006G2G1N6,"A great indie film about both the race to world first during the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion, as well as exploring the lives of some of the real life players behind the Blood Legion guild. This guild was nearly at the top of their game and pushing world first progression against tried and true world first guilds. Definitely worth watching if you are into Massively Multiplayer Online Games!",1512864000,,403,4.855072463768116

8497364,4,B006G2G1N6,"Came on time, is what I expected. I play wow. The movie was just okay to me, got kind of boring, but that is what to be expected in a documentary. That is just a personal opinion you might actually like it, so don't hesitate to buy it.",1360886400,,235,3.9166666666666665
