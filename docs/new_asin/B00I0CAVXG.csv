6245700,3,B00I0CAVXG,"the story was pretty cool, but the actors sounded like they were reading from a piece of paper.",1409011200,5,95,4.333333333333333
6245701,5,B00I0CAVXG,"Great movie, start off slow, has a lot of twists and a surprise ending.",1404345600,6,71,4.142857142857143
6245702,4,B00I0CAVXG,"this movie deals with a lot of details about relationships that goes bad and goes bad quickly, watching it speaks for itself",1403913600,7,124,4.681818181818182
6245703,3,B00I0CAVXG,"This was alright. This is not something that I have to watch. It was like, since I bought it, finish watching it. I don't like seeing movies that females always have to play a stupid role involving someone they meet on line or through some kind of matchmaking over the phone.",1403654400,6,275,4.411764705882353
6245704,5,B00I0CAVXG,"Good Movie I support movies like this, and I would like to see more like this, I will look for more movies like this",1403049600,7,116,3.875
6245705,4,B00I0CAVXG,I really enjoyed this film. I used to meet crazy women on the phone chat hotline and this film deals with what happens when a woman meets a man on the chatline who is too good to be true. This movie would be rated PG-13. There are a couple of mild curses and mild violence at the end of the film. There is no sex or nudity. One woman appears in her underwear in one scene. This film is important because many people don't realize the dangers of meeting complete strangers on the phone chat hotline and then meeting them in person. You never know who you are meeting. They could be violent criminals or rapists. Highly recommended for viewers who love romantic dramas featuring an African American cast. A must see if you have ever use the phone chat hotline. Parents may want to let their teens watch this film as a cautionary tale regarding dating. Educators can show this film in High Schools to warn teens about the dangers of dating strangers.,1402617600,15,947,4.448275862068965

6245742,4,B00I0CAVXG,"I first discovered this movie is on YouTube. The actors are SO bad, and the story is so cliche and cheesy, but at the same time, it's so entertaining!

6245760,2,B00I0CAVXG,The movie's pace was extremely slow and most of the actors could not act whatsoever. And the ending was just extremely stupid. I'm not gonna give it away for those who wanna see this movie and may actuallly like it. I disliked it so much that I ended up getting a refund. My advice is: don't buy!,1420070400,,296,4.2105263157894735

8637955,1,B00I0CAVXG,"This is the worst acting Ive seen in a long time. I was gringing from the first line. Every line delivered was worse than the next. I couldn't make it through the whole thing. Bc the acting was THAT bad. It was like an 8th grade play. But the 8th graders would be better.
