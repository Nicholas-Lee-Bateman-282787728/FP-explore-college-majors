3486915,5,B001B8TKFG,"I have to admit that it has been a loooong time coming for this release.  I collected all of the Lions series and when that series came to it's conclusion I HOPED that that the Vehicle team was next up for release.  After checking with Best Buy when I first heard of the DVD release and walking away with the answer of DELAY, on more than just ONE occasion, I became VERY skeptical as to whether or not the release would ever see the light of day.  So I checked AMAZON.COM (cheap plug for a great server), and saw that not only was it released, but it was IN STOCK even before the latest release date that I had obtained from Best Buy!  So I figured it was worth a shot and placed my order.  Less than a week later I was pleasantly surprised with it's arrival.  I haven't gotten through all 3 discs yet, but I am very pleased with the job done on the transfer.  MUCH more than I was with the poorly done ""FLEET OF DOOM"" (Please see my other reviews) release.  I only hope that the other two sets receive the same great treatment that the Air Team set has.  Because as we all know and witnessed in the ""FLEET OF DOOM"" movie that VEHICLE VOLTRON is BY FAR the SUPERIOR version.  Let's not forget just who bailed who out in the movie!  VEHICLE VOLTRON FANS UNITE!",1229472000,,1260,4.186721991701245
3486916,5,B001B8TKFG,"Received my advanced copy of this, the 6th volume of the Voltron animated series today and have been enjoying every moment of this collection.  While much debate exists as to which version of Voltron was superior, in truth the source material was actually two entirely separate Japanese series.  WEP, through some slick editing, was able to turn Dairugger XV into what we now know as Vehicle Voltron back in the mid 1980s.  This DVD set represents the first foray of the Voltron franchise devoted exclusively to Vehicle Voltron.

When compared to the original incarnation, Vehichle Voltron strays a but farther from the fantasy roots of GoLion (Lion Force here in the States) in favor of a more science-fiction based approach.  The visual quality and presentation is easily on par with WEP's volume 1-5 releases with the Air Team (Strato Fighter) gracing the cover.

Included on this set is the following:
Episodes 73-90 of the series (450 minutes total run time)
Remastered film transfer from the original 35mm stock
5.1 Surround Sound Mix
The Vehichle Voltron pilot
Featurette: Vehicle Voltron Fans Unite
Team Up Clips
Full episode synopsis with original air dates

While this box set is surrounded by enthusiasm as it represents the first DVD release devoted entitrely to Vehichle Voltron, WEP isn't letting the dust settle for long before following up with the next box, Volume 7 which is set to be released on January, 13 2009.  Like Volume 6, this will be another Vehicle Voltron exclusive set with The Land Team (Turbo Terrain Fighter) on the cover.  Can't wait!",1227830400,16,1569,4.980842911877395

3486919,5,B001B8TKFG,"Yes, the Lion Force Voltron series was the most popular and probably the most memorable and loved out of the series.. But I am glad the Vehicle Force Voltron series is coming out on DVD because I think that now as an adult I can probably enjoy it more for its SciFi centric story lines. As a child I was confused by it and never bothered to get into it.",1222041600,2,353,4.057142857142857

3486921,5,B001B8TKFG,"As a kid growing up, I always thought Vehicle Voltron was cooler and more fascinating than Lion Voltron. I'm trilled the VV epsiodes are finally coming to DVD. I also love the continuity between the two shows, e.g., Chip is Pidge's brother. This is great, and in my opinion, the finest Voltron.

3486935,2,B001B8TKFG,"I respect what they tried to do by combining several animes together, but this just doesn't do anything for me.  I had seen Vehicle Voltron on the Fleet of Doom special as a kid, & that always confused me a little.  Why were there 2 Voltrons?  I still loved it though, so I thought I might enjoy the series.  I was wrong.  This just isn't my cup of tea.  If it were another series I would probably find it okay, but this is supposed to be Voltron.  The original was so good on its own, how could they duplicate the charm it had by rewriting another anime into it?  This worked in Robotech by having the story span 3 generations with each one represented by a different series, & it also worked on Macron 1 via the parallel universe angle, which if used properly could actually improve the story.  And while I prefer Lion Voltron over Golion because the violence is way too graphic for me, I feel the need to watch the original Japanese version Dairugger after seeing this, because this is the wrong series to tone down.  It was just boring to me.  If anyone else enjoyed it I'm glad, but I just didn't care for it.  I give it 2 stars because it's not horrible, just boring and at least when I bought it I got a free t-shirt with the real Voltron on it.",1370995200,2,1252,4.214285714285714

3486939,3,B001B8TKFG,"Who's idea was it to cheapen an 8o's classic with a cardboard container, instead of metal one. And I noticed the discs from the second disc of set 5 the black lion on.... vibrate badly, though the episodes are viewable their quality is that of vhs. The sad thing is I could live without that crap, World Events solo project sucks. Media Blasters should have forgotten all those episodes and skipped straight to vehicle voltron. The characters suck, the voice acting sucked, the music sucked. They made Voltron but couldn't keep Voltron true to form? It makes little sense to me,but set 5 should have been in a cardboard container with a few sheets of toilet paper as a warning to what was to come.",1359763200,,697,4.584

3486942,5,B001B8TKFG,"This dvd chronicles the beginning of the vehicle voltron force.  This version is not as popular as the lion force, but it is a must for any fan.",1331424000,4,144,4.142857142857143
3486943,5,B001B8TKFG,"This has always been my favorite Voltron version. The lion force is iconic, but I hated the wimpy princess and silly mice. The plots made the first 20 minutes almost impossible to sit through and besides a few episodes, the final fight was always brief and repetitive. I never liked the magic-powers-theme that made Voltron more than a machine. Even the bad guys- showing up week after week doing the exact same thing got real corny. Even as a kid I knew this was kinda cheezie.

AND SO I always loved the Vehicle Force more. They were explorers going places. The individual lions were weak, but the 3 land, sea and air units were awesome and formidable. The 5 minutes of stored nuclear energy was a little weak though. Going forward...It made sense (like Gundam) that every fleet or division had only so many resources to support a robeast so it was logical for Voltron to be going one-on-one every week.

Firstly, these are the US edited versions so they toned down the gore by cutting scenes with graphic violence. Also they verbally changed all the soldiers to androids to be more gentle about death on the battlefield. They also say enemies escaped (never to be seen again?) that really died in the series. You can youtube or search for cut Voltron scenes and see how much more adult BOTH these shows were overseas.

Highly recommended for fans of Vehicle Voltron.
Okay Amazon, let's get the un-cut Japanese versions on here too.",1317340800,5,1434,4.682539682539683
3486944,3,B001B8TKFG,"Voltron Volume 6 is a three-disc DVD set that includes the first eighteen episodes of the Vehicle Voltron series.  The first disc contains six episodes, extras, and trailers.  The second and third discs contain six episodes and extras.

On the first disc, the extra is labeled as ""Team Up Clip.""  This feature runs for one minute and seven seconds, and it takes footage from the Fleet of Doom special (where Lion Force Voltron and Vehicle Voltron team up together), and set the footage to the opening theme music for Voltron.  Personally, I thought this extra was a waste.  There are also trailers included on this disc for Alteil, GoLion, and GaoGaiGar.

The extra on the second disc is labeled as ""Vehicle Voltron Pilot.""  This is the original pilot for Vehicle Voltron, and lasts for about twenty-three minutes.  The beginning is much different from the aired first episode, and incorporates a lot of the footage from the Dairugger XV opening credits, with a voice-over done by Peter Cullen (the voice for Commander Hawkins).  While this provided a lot of background information, it made for a rather boring viewing experience.  Once the actual story gets going, it's a lot closer to the actual first episode.  However, some of the voices are different, some of the character names are different, some of the dialogue is different, and the not all of the music overdubs are in it.

The third disc contains two special features.  The first is ""Vehicle Featurette.""  This runs for about five minutes, and includes interviews with Jeremy Corray, Executive Producer Peter Keefe, Story Editor Marc Handler, Director Franklin Cofod, and World Events President Ted Koplar.  It's very interesting to note that Peter Keefe tried to give a revisionist history for Vehicle Voltron, which is not only contradicted by interviews Peter himself gave in the Lion Force featurettes, but is also contradicted by interviews done by others that appear after Peter's interview.  Basically, Peter was trying to make it appear that Vehicle Voltron was less of a ""failure"" than it really was.  This featurette also goes into why Lion Force was more popular than Vehicle, and why Vehicle Voltron is still a ""must see"" series.

The other feature on the third disc is ""Vehicle Voltron Fans Unite.""  The introductory voice over done by Jeremy Corray includes an inaccuracy in it; he claims that the first Vehicle Voltron episode aired in November 1984, but according to the airdates in the booklet, the first Vehicle Voltron episode aired in September 1984.  The September date also matches what I remember; the first seven episodes of Lion Force Voltron aired that September, and then, instead of an eighth Lion Force episode, the first episode of Vehicle Voltron aired instead.  After the introduction, the feature highlights select quotes from the [...] forums.  The feature runs for about five minutes.

Personally, I would only recommend this set to either die-hard fans of both Voltron series or to die-hard fans of Vehicle Voltron.

3486947,5,B001B8TKFG,"Vehicle Voltron finally comes to us on dvd after a long wait.  It brought back all the adventure I enjoyed as a kid watching this program after school.  A big deal is made about the Lion Voltron but this one always was my favorite.  The space explorers on board the ship titled ""Explorer"", lol, is on a mission to find habitable new worlds in a region of space that is occupied by the very hostile Drule Empire.  As our heroes attempt to colonize these new worlds in Drule territory, they in turn try to throw them out by attacking them with Robeast monsters and their own mighty fleets.  The Galaxy Alliance counters with Voltron, that is made up of three vehicle teams known as Air, Land & Sea teams.  Led by team leader Jeff, they attempt to stop the Drules and keep a foothold on these new planets by assembling Voltron.  This show maybe a little slow at first but the plot lines pick up when a certain Drule Leader named Hazar sees that fighting against the Galaxy Alliance could be a mistake especially since their own population is also in a race against time to find new planets as well because of overcrowding.

The episodes I have watched so far are very good quality and I haven't seen any serious issues with disc playback or other factors that would prevent anyone from enjoying the episodes.
