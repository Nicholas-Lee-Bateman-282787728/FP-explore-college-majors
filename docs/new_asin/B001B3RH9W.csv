This is an Indian movie, set in modern times, and regards certain high-ranking military officers. The movie is a fictional account of a (possibly real) incident in which an officer faces court marshal for disobeying orders. The particular incident involved a military action against terrorists operating near India's border, and hence conflicting cultural and religious value are an issue. The viewer will notice the obvious strong relation in customs and mannerisms to the army of the former British government. However it is not being implied that British rule is at the root of the problem (as the reader may think). Instead the problem is part of India's (and Asia's) centuries old multi cultural conflicts and, at the movie's end, there is an extended tirade to this effect.

This is a `think-piece' and the above is phrased so as not to give away any details. Make no mistake. This movie is way beyond well directed, acted and photographed. We aren't talking ""third world"" here.

Seeing that the name of Martin Luther King is mentioned in the movie, in ambiguous context, Americans would do well to reflect on how cultural differences have been used to divide their country.",1371427200,,1241,5.073529411764706
8436040,4,B001B3RH9W,"The coldness on KK (Brigadier's) face was outstanding. His dialog about ""how a cup of coffee is made"" and ""pigs sweat men perspire"" showed how great of an actor he is and how underestimated. I liked Minissha for whatever role she was given. I have been gaga over her since ""Yahaan"", which was another great movie.

It is always a treat to watch such movies out of all the junk that bollywood throws out. I agree that the starting of the movie could have done without the Bar song, but by the time the movie ends, you're left wondering. For me, Kay Kay stole the show, where as Rahul Bose again proves his caliber that he showed in ""Mr and Mrs Iyer"". Go watch this!",1304035200,,664,4.312
8436041,3,B001B3RH9W,"Movie was good, actors are nice, movie is pretty much a remake of the movie ""Big"" with Tom Hanks... but more romantic than comedy. It also kinda felt like other bollywood movie: Aladin (which is far more superior). I don't have anything bad to say about the film really, but nothing really stands out of it. its just a decent movie.",1283040000,,332,4.459016393442623
