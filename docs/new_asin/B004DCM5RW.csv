4331929,2,B004DCM5RW,"It would make a great movie on it's own - but the fact its called ""mean girls 2"" makes you think it's a crappy remake rather than a proper movie; how on earth can you create a sequel with none of the original actors or plot? It's fab for a girls night in (I thoroughly enjoyed it), but bear in mind it has NOTHING to do with the actual ""mean girls"" film.",1296000000,12,354,3.9305555555555554
4331930,1,B004DCM5RW,"Jo is a transfer student who just wants a quiet school year before she's off to study architecture at Carnegie-Mellon University. She befriends rich but klutzy Abby, a target for the cliquy ""plastics"" led by chief mean girl Mandi. In a twist Abby's father pays Jo to befriend her, and Jo realizes that her new BFF is worth more than the cash. Soon a war between the plastics and well everyone else at the school breaks out. Will Jo come clean with Abby before her secret is revealed?

With a d-list cast, bad writing, lots of overacting (never a good thing), and no real story to tell, this sequel is pretty awful. I still cannot believe that I sat through it, particularly when it was paired with the far superior original. Some sequels should just never get made.",1295913600,67,765,4.543478260869565
4331931,4,B004DCM5RW,"I liked Mean Girls 2, but there were two problems that bugged me: Maiara Walsh and cursing. Maiara Walsh doesn't sound like the Maiara Walsh I saw in Cory In The House. She had a cute Brazilian accent, but now...ick. And all the Dsney stars curse, which I think ruins their image as preppy actresses (Nicole and Jennifer curse once, but Meaghan curses several times). Overall, great movie on ABC Family, but a terrible movie for Disney Channel and their actresses. What y'all think?",1295827200,2,482,4.75
4331932,5,B004DCM5RW,"This Movie was awesome but the first mean girls is better because it's more entertaining, Anyway a student named Jo goes to north shore high school which was the same high school from the previous film and brought back the principal but everyone else is gone from the first one, Plus can Jo try to get rid of Mandi, The Cast wasn't that bad Meaghan Martin played Jo, Jennifer Stone played Abby, It wasn't the most baddest cast ever because the acting was pretty good and wasn't bad and also Jo goes through a lot in this film, If they made a third Mean girls which would be called mean girls 3 that is out of the question this is not bad for a sequel but if you make it a franchise that would be a waste of time 2 film's for Mean girls and that's it, This movie was pretty good but if you don't think their should be a sequel from the classic then don't watch it.",1293667200,2,863,4.112426035502959

4332034,2,B004DCM5RW,I would never recommend this to anyone.  The first one had some depth to it.  This one was just wretched.,1397606400,3,105,4.2
4332054,5,B004DCM5RW,"I think a lot of people have a problem with this movie because they expect a sequel to be as good as the first or better.  I never go into a sequel comparing it to the original.  If this movie had been made using a different name, and was considered an individual movie in it's own right, then I'm sure there wouldn't be as many complaints.  I think this movie was a lot of fun.  How could anyone not love the character of sweet Abby.  My heart went out to her every time she was treated badly, and I found myself wanting to protect her from the meanies.  I also think Jo was a cool character.  I love how she was a sassy, streetwise smart girl who could do anything the boys could do.  There was also more romance in this movie than there had been in the first one.  I admit the dumb character Chastity didn't do as good a job as Amanda Seyfried did in the first movie, and the queen bee Mandi didn't quite have the edge of Rachel Mcadams, but I think you understand Mandi's motives in this movie better than Regina.  I never did understand why Regina was so mean.  The friendship between Jo and Abby was also nicer than the one between Janis and Cady in the first movie.  By the end of this movie I so desperately wanted Jo and Abby to win, and for Mandi to get what she deserved.  That was something I definitely didn't feel by the end of the first movie.",1397260800,,1358,4.137404580152672

4332057,5,B004DCM5RW,i would recommend this product to everyone it has everything romance a little sad but mostly hilarious i love this movie it can maybe be even better than the 1st one i love this movie get it get it! i love it i watched it like 10x for a 48 hour rental!,1388275200,,252,3.8653846153846154

4332065,1,B004DCM5RW,"This was an awful movie. The acting was mediocre at best, and they were mean but with no purpose. Remember when Lindsay Lohan said "" all of the fighting in girl world had to be sneaky"", well these girls don't follow that rule, or any of the rules. They also appear to be 12-14 years old. Don't buy this movie.",1371772800,5,309,4.166666666666667
4332066,1,B004DCM5RW,"I expected this to be a sequel to the original and its not.  The script is almost written as a reimagining of the first one.  5 minutes into film you are going to realize its so much worse than you could have ever thought.

The writing is so bad and leaves a lot to be desired.  There are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through.  The sound effects are over the top and annoying.  The characters are transparent and throw away.  This is another in a long line of films that declare a protagonist and forget to give you a reason to like them.

This is where the original was fantastic.  Logan was great at sucking you in and Fay was the best at strategically steering the cast into the right places.  This movie will lead you astray from the start and never get you back on course.

Praise.  13 yo girls will like this but all other avoid at all costs.",1362268800,4,858,4.164634146341464

4332068,1,B004DCM5RW,"I bought this rather than rent it, as it didn't cost much more. Now I know why. The plot was kind of cute, but that's all that's good about it. The no-name cast didn't prove their mettle. Loved the first Mean Girls.",1357171200,3,215,4.142857142857143
4332069,1,B004DCM5RW,"If I could give this negative stars I'd give it a negative 100. It doesn't even deserve stars. The lead girl is from stupid Disney channel and threw the whole movie she needed to wash her hair. The 3 ""mean girls"" we're awful, they dressed like 8 year olds and it was retarded that the one brought a dog to school. All the girls couldn't act for there lives. I can quote every line from the first movie because the first movie was pure genius, it was made to be funny. The second one was centered around bullying, that ruins the whole concept. At at the end where she's like ""let's settle this like men, lets play football"" that was the dumbest thing I've ever herd in my life. This movie sucked so bad and should be erased from history.",1356825600,3,736,4.264285714285714
4332070,1,B004DCM5RW,"I bought this movie not actually seeing it. BIG MISTAKE!

I thought it was going to be a lot like the Lindsay Lohan 'Mean Girls' movie and appeal to people who were over the age of 14.
I now see this is a movie for young girls between the ages of 10-14. It's got Jennifer Stone from ""Wizards of Waverly Place"", Meaghan Martin from ""Camp Rock"", Nicole Anderson from ""Jonas"", Claire Holt from ""H2o: Just Add Water"", Diego Boneta from ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Pretty Little Liars"", Mairara Walsh from ""Cory In The House"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" -- So it has a few actors and actresses that are well known to a younger audience than myself.

If you like the movie like ""Camp Rock"" then you are probably going to like this movie.

If you are looking for a great sequel to the awesome Lindsay Lohan ""Mean Girls"" movie, I'm sorry to say but it will just lead to disappointment and regret.",1355788800,4,879,4.41358024691358

4332078,2,B004DCM5RW,"After Mean Girls was such a hit a few years before, audiences would expect that a sequel should live up to what it's predacessor promised.  However, this was not the case with this movie.  A semi innocent outsider comes into a new high school wanting to have a year free of drama before she finishes her last year before heading off to Carnegie Mellon.  She's a tough girl, so she seems, not caring what others think and has her quirky interests (shop class) where she doesn't have to contend with other women/girls for attentions.  And then she meets a loveable gal named Abby who is clumbsy and awkward, and oddly enough, from a wealthy family.  Her father eventually pays Jo (our hero) to be Abby's friend.  Then the Mean Girls clique, headed by the slightly dimwitted Mandy, is out to get her.  Jo and her friends then form their own clique, calling themselves the Anti-Plastics, in an effort to usurp the Plastics powers and control.

The story itself had some potential, but it was ruined by fair acting and not being very strong a plot to begin with.  The message in this movie (as well as it's predacessor) is that power corrupts.  I only got it because it came in a two pack purchase with Mean Girls 1.  Otherwise how else would people see this?",1328572800,19,1254,4.528888888888889

4332080,5,B004DCM5RW,My 13-year old daughter had been thinking about Mean Girls for a while and wanted to get the DVD. We ran across this double set for a great deal and it arrived in a quick amount of time. She immediately watched them upon receipt and enjoyed them both.,1325462400,4,251,4.25
4332081,1,B004DCM5RW,"Disgusting. I could say it over and over again. This movie is so irritating, it's--you guessed it--disgusting. These Disney stars trade in their Wizard wands and golden microphones for ""easy upchuck"" medicine and foul mouths. To hear them cry ""you narccisstic b----h"" and ""He sounds like an a--"" in their squeaky little high-pitched voices isn't just offensive, it's stupid. Honestly? It's like hearing 6th and 7th graders cuss out their friends. That's what these girls look like, too...grade-schoolers instead of seniors. There's very few redemptive qualities: Jo shrugs off Mandi's tormenting (until the Plastics hurt Jo's dad...then she makes Mandi's life miserable). Jo is made fun of for being a virgin, but then people tell her secretly they wish they'd waited too. Jo has a good relationship with her dad. She doesn't want to accept money for being friends with a girl, but soon after she does take it she feels guilty and returns it. The soundtrack isn't spectacular, but it has some good tracks.
On the other hand, you have the bad: Mandi is a seemingly perfect little princess, but she's spiteful and vindictive. She proudly admits ""I'm a benevolent dictator"" and is thoroughly obsessed with herself. Chastity is the complete opposite of what her name means, as she has a ""raging libido"" and is ""stupid enough to hit a home run with any guy who was willing to play"". We see her passionately kissing several boys in isolated areas such as a stairwell ""a herpes disaster waiting to happen"". The plastics use everything from sex to money, compliments to sabotage to get exactly what they want. Jo, for all her good qualities, is a foul-mouthed tomboy who steals Mandi's popularity by wearing immodest rocker clothes (but of course, they have to be trendy--thus the bright yellow flowers and lacy frills and girly accents. Right.).
For the utterly ridiculous aspects, there's plenty: The show-down, a game of powerpuff football...huh??? The plastics do not deliver a particularly memorable performance in their popular girl roles. They seem more like mediocre superstar wannabes. Their clothes don't really pop or stand out; they seem to blend. There's just not much to differentiate between the populars and the ""normal"" people, except perhaps the be in the in crowd you must be completely evil and wear pink. There's also no explanation as to why the Plastics are...well, the Plastics. They aren't involved in anything at the school...sports, cheerleading, no class president-status...they aren't the principal's kids and their parents aren't the richest. I suppose it must be that they ruin people's lives. But honestly, if some punk freshman with no real power started playing the pranks on everyone, trying to be top dog, wouldn't the older kids put them in their place in the real wrold? Maiara Walsh, who plays Mandi, gives the best effort. She's gorgeous and brunette (always nice to see the ""it"" girl with dark hair, not blonde) and her voice is deeper than you would expect--not the normal high-pitched whine. The storyline is predictable, shallow, and boring. If I could, I'd give it a negative five stars. Wish I hadn't wasted so much time watching it.

This is horribly corny, unrealistic, and lame. The humor in the original Mean Girls is replaced with the timid use of two curse words and way too much slapstick. Don't waste your time.",1304726400,17,411,4.5675675675675675

4332094,2,B004DCM5RW,"When everyone heard about the Mean Girls sequel, our minds went to the worst possibilities. We expected it to be a cheesy knock-off of the first movie. Our thoughts were correct. It is unrepresentative of the classic that Mean Girl fans know and love.

Unfortunately, that's the biggest issue with the movie: being unrelentlessly compared to the original. If we saw this movie as a completely different movie, it would be much better. But,it's impossible to not compare the Original and sequel. Our preconceived notions of what a Mean Girls movie needs makes us compare the movie to the original. Mean Girls 2 is an average movie that probably could have found its niche with a teenage audience, but it's instead forced into the ""bad sequel"" group. Whoever's idea it was to make this movie and add the MG2 title to make more money clearly didn't realize how bad of an idea it was.",1303516800,5,880,4.714285714285714

I couldn't make it through the entire movie without doing something in addition to watching the movie to distract me from its awfulness.

We have the typical moment where her and her friends part ways, only to be reunited in the end with a happy ending.

The story is old and over-used.  Nothing new or exciting brought to the table here.  Do these things ever happen in high school? I really doubt it.

I enjoyed it. The lead role is played by a blonde, but a smart blonde. I think they did a great job of making Jo the smart popular girl even though she got pranked on, she took it with a smile...at first then she started to go out for revenge. I think she played each role pretty well (The victim, the attacker, the loner and eventually hero) I think Amanda Bynes would have shined in the role, it's up her alley, but regardless its fine.

4332100,3,B004DCM5RW,"This is not a sequel but a remake of the original. As a sequel goes, it rates up there with Caddy Shack II. The movie starts out with some smart narration as people are compared to the cars that they drive. The message of the story is mixed and lost. At one point it was a High School Animal Farm where the non-plastics were as bad as the plastics, and at other times it was about friendship.

The movie starts out at about 4 stars and digresses to no stars during a female football game that made no sense. Rated PG-13, and that is about the age of the audience this film was designed. Three stars is generous, but I am old and the girls are cute. BTW putting sugar in a gas tank is not just mean but is criminal activity.",1297555200,6,723,4.091549295774648

I love the first Mean Girls and I only watched this to see how bad it would be. I was right. Instead of wasting your money on this, go buy the first Mean Girls (again, even if you already have it) or go see that new 3D Justin Bieber movie (just stay away from this). That's how bad this movie is. The most anyone should watch this movie is once.",1296864000,11,522,3.980952380952381

When Jo stands up for Abby (Stone) at school, Abby's dad offers to pay for her college (which her dad can't afford) if she will be Abby's friend.  I will start by saying I thought the first one was really funny.  Tim Meadows is the only returning cast member from the original, and the best part of the movie.  This one took everything that was funny and great about the first one and replaced it with the ""New Plastics"" just being evil.  Not like first mean girl mean, but out right evil!  There were a few scenes that made me chuckle but overall I felt bad for everyone in the school.  If this is how high school girls really act now, private or home school is the way to go.  I also think I am probebly 20 years to old to fully relate, and a guy, so I did not enjoy it.  No big surprises here, very predictable and not very funny.  It does have the obligatory ""Saved by the bell"" story arc and ending.  Evil, evil girls, decent message.  I give it a C.

If they served this movie next to a plate of asparagus flavored ramen you'd never be able to sort out which of the two left that taste in your mouth.

8425149,3,B004DCM5RW,"The original film released seven years before this one was, set the benchmark for female school bullying and the term mean girls became part of the vocabulary for female bullying not just in schools, but workplaces and other social situations as well.  There's been heaps of female villain putting down other women movies over the years, but they always get compared to mean girls.  It was that successful.  So it was inevitable in 2011 that the movie studios decided to cash in on that movie, with a sequel, well not really a sequel but a remake with a bunch of new student mean girls and victims.  The only character to return is the principal played by Tim Meadows, who for me seeing this in 2017, is the only recognisable actor in the whole film.

You'd got to the film it's due for the fact it actually cast actors who were clearly still teens themselves to play the school girl characters.  Most school based movies these days have adults in those roles. But where the film is let down is that it simply isn't that original a storyline, there's no clever lines, insults, visual gags, that you haven't seen before.  A new attractive girl comes to a school ruled by three girls everyone calls the plastics, she doesn't care about popularity or even making friends, but gives a lift home to the girl at the bottom of the social pecking order since the plastic vandalised that girl's expensive car with paint.  As his daughter flees up the stairs and starts crying in her room, the father offers the new girl some serious wads of cash to be her friend.  Being there's likely no other way she will be able to afford to go to university, the new girl accepts.  Of course this isn't a new concept for a movie and you know full well how this will turn out.  The plastics of course don't like that this new girl is interfering in their allocated pecking order for other students and begin to target the new girl.

The movie is watchable, but not memorable, and not something you're likely to watch a second time.  For a trio of girls to rule the school through fear, the movie really needed to establish how this was possible.  It failed to do so.  They weren't unattractive but there were plenty of other girls better looking than they were.  Their victim was richer than they were, so they didn't have the whole daddy can hire better lawyers than yours so the whole car vandalism thing made no sense.  Surely the other father would be demanding the other ones' parents pay for his expensive car's repairs and their parents wouldn't be to thrilled with their daughters about this.  Surely they would at least be expelled for that too, being most Americans would never be able to afford that car in their lifetime let alone a school kid.  We don't learn anything about the plastics parents that would make us believe they have immunity to do anything. If this was a small town and their parents owned the factory that employed everyone or something like that, then their power would make some sense.

I don't think the acting is bad in this, the teenage actors do well with what they have.  It's the writing that lets the movie down.  The fact that it is called Mean Girls 2, and not something else also means viewers expectations are a lot higher.",1492473600,,3245,4.5395189003436425
