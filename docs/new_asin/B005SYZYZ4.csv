4887782,5,B005SYZYZ4,"In this movie, potentially as iconic for BMW owners as ""Bullitt"" is for Mustang fans, the focus is not so much about plot, storyline or cars (although the plot is clear, straightforward and well developed), but rather about personal motivations, desires, emotions, the way that interactions between people reveal things hidden from ourselves, and the fragility of communications between experience and youth.  George C. Scott stars as Harry Garmes, a former professional getaway driver living in semi-retirement in a Portuguese fishing village.  The owner of a powerful BMW 507, which he carefully maintains himself, he is (for various reasons) lured into doing one last seemingly straightforward getaway job.  At first, things proceed according to plan.  The situation, however, is not what he was initially led to believe.  Increasingly complex and challenging consequences ensue.  I will not offer any plot spoilers.  Suffice it to stay that director Richard Fleischer and cinematographer Sven Nykvist do an excellent job of balancing the development of characters, plot, tension and suspense; the car chase scenes are much more realistic and believable than those in most suspense movies; and the ending hangs together.  This is a minor classic, emotionally much more credible, complex, thought-provoking and satisfying than most suspense movies, and deserving of much greater attention and appreciation than it has received from either movie aficionados or the public.  Insightful, satisfying, and a purchase well worth your money.",1366761600,,1536,5.586206896551724
4887783,5,B005SYZYZ4,"OK, I'll admit I ordered this only to see the footage of the BMW 503, I've never seen one in real life. Plenty of footage of it at speed, interesting driving sequences throughout the film.",1358121600,,188,4.4
4887784,5,B005SYZYZ4,"I loved the action flicks of the 70's and I was glad to find this one on Amazon as I don't recall seeing it back then.  George C. Scott was interesting as the retired ""getaway driver"" living in Portugal going out for one last job.  A different take on that kind of Character than Ryan O'Neal in ""The Driver"".  Tony Musante was always a good Bad Guy and since he had just passed away, it was a nice tribute to him if one remembers him as the eternal mobster.  This film isn't a real crash and bang movie, although there are some good action scenes.  Driving especially, takes a front seat here.  Good if you want to see some classic actors in a rarely seen film from some time ago.  Worth watching for sure if you are a Crime movie buff.",1329868800,,736,4.177304964539007
4887785,5,B005SYZYZ4,"This is an excellent mostly forgotten movie which was sold in 1971 as being in the Bogart mold presumably because ""Play It Again Sam"" was on general release in theaters and ""Casablanca"" featured regularly on the box. However, it has much more in common with the films of french director Jean-Pierre Melville than with the WArner Bros output of Humphrey Bogart.  It has some similarities with the recent George Clooney film ""The American"" but is superior in every department.  ""The Last Run"" was planned by John Boorman, principal photography began with John Huston at the helm who was quickly replaced by Richard Fleischer. Despite these changes at the top the finished film remains consistent in tone throughout.  Only the final five minutes or so disappoint slightly. Even so, the actual denouement still has a ""Chinatown"" feel - the nice guy suffers a sudden death and the sleazeball and his duplicitous girlfriend skedaddle to Africa.

This is a beautifully crafted movie. Sven Nykvist's lighting and camera set ups are perfection apart from one silly crash zoom in on George C.Scott on a balcony, but this can be forgiven considering most popular action films of the time were littered with such ugly camerawork.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is one of his best, not in the same league as ""The Wind & The Lion"" or ""Chinatown"" but still excellent and suitably spare.  Russell Lloyd's editing of the numerous driving scenes is highly impressive and puts to shame all the other road movies of this era such as ""The Vanishing Point"" and ""Easy Rider"". I guess credit for these scenes should also go to second unit director Roy Stevens.

Alan Sharp's spare terse screenplay feels just right, looking back to the gangster movies of Jean-Pierre Melville and forward to the 1970's road movies of Wim Wenders.

The Warner Archive disc looks wonderful. It is presented in 2.35:1 and is perfectly clean, and is sharper and better looking than the DVD of ""The American"". Amazingly, unlike modern movies, you can hear every line of dialogue and the sound mix has highs and lows and no pop songs.  This disc and film are so good that I watched it two days running.",1323561600,15,2149,4.865753424657535
4887786,5,B005SYZYZ4,"George C. Scott's performance is for my money the best of his career---and he has given some great performances over the years.  Real depth of feeling.  But this would not be possible without Alan Sharp's script which is both brilliant and deeply moving.  Sharp is the unsung hero of this film.  (Sharp you may recall wrote the screenplay for Night Moves and he turned what would have been just another private eye story into a great film---thanks also to Gene Hackman's great delivery of Sharp's lines)  Early on in The Last Run we hear Scott say ""When my wife told me she was going to Switzerland to get her breasts lifted I thought she meant surgically."" and the great lines just keep coming.

This is a movie that plays at two levels:  the obvious one of thriller with an entertaining plot and the one that takes you to the depths of the human soul as a man finds himself alone seeking not just a last run at driving a car for gangsters but a last run at love.

Jerry Goldsmith is in good form with a haunting and lyrical score.  And Richard Fleischer's direction is fine.

The Last Run is a great film and it easily finds its way onto my top 25 films of all time list.",1321315200,24,1173,4.339449541284404
4887787,3,B005SYZYZ4,"This is the kind of film where you sit watching thinking this film is going to take off now any minute and become really good but it never actually does.

There are good aspects and bad to this movie. The plot is something you've probably seen already a million times in one guise or another; The ''good'' bad man who is long retired but now bored takes on a last job to see if he still has what it takes but the job is not as straight forward as it first seemed...  The spin on it this time is that George C. Scott is the Bogartesque anti-hero getaway driver living in a secluded part of Portugal who has to transport an escaped convict from neighbouring Spain to France. Cue some moderate suprises, a decent music score, great scenery of 70's Portugal and Spain and George C. Scott in good form giving a trademark for him intense and explosive performance.

The bad aspects are as follows; Scott has noone to really bounce off of for most of the film...the convict is played by Tony Musante who feels more t.v. than movies and dosen't really stack up against a powerful performer like Scott. Likewise the convicts ''moll'' who comes along for the ride is played by Trish Van Devere who is really miscast for the role. She is too prim and elegant for the character type she plays and dosen't stack up against Scott either. Colleen Dewhurst is in the movie for all of 5 minutes in a bit part and she really does stack up against Scott, she should have been given the Van Devere role.

Of course being a thriller there are car chases and some action scenes. Oddly some of them are great and others fall really flat and seem amateurish. The film also suffers a bit from a slightly peculiar tone; It's a throwback to the film-noir genre of the 40's and 50's on the one hand but on the other it's trying to be hip for the time it was made by being an Easyrider type road trip movie which meanders for a lot of it's run time. It's a juxtaposition that dosen't always work.

It's not hard to see why the film wasn't a success and if you google it you will find that it had a very troubled production history going through two directors and leading ladies as well as various script rewrites during filming. But all that said if you are a fan of George C. Scott or 70's cinema you might find this an interesting, sometimes entertaining and other times frustrating experience.",1321056000,14,2367,4.382687927107061
4887788,4,B005SYZYZ4,"Finally we get to see this movie in a video release.  Long out of the theaters, I haven't seen this in decades.  It's one of those 2-1/2 star movies that just stick with you all through the years.  George C. Scott in the prime of his career.  Highly reccommended for lovers of noir or legacy crime dramas.",1319068800,7,305,4.298245614035087

4887791,2,B005SYZYZ4,"Dull action film about a wheelman taking on one last job before retiring for good.  George C. Scott seems to be in paycheck mode sleepwalking through the role of the driver.  The action sequences are by-the-book and uninspired which is about as much to be expected by hack director Richard Fleischer (""Doctor Doolittle"").  Scott met his future wife Trish Van Devere while making this film so at least somebody got something out of the deal.",1432425600,,440,4.84

4887793,5,B005SYZYZ4,"I like George Scott so I am biased.  The movie has flaws but if you want a good story of an older man who wants to see if he has what it takes to do one more crime job, you will enjoy this.",1426723200,,189,3.395348837209302
4887794,1,B005SYZYZ4,"First, I am a big George C. Scott fan, which is why I bought this movie. I like to watch him act, hear his voice and his overall screen presence is great. This movie embodies most of the annoying things about movies made in the 1970's. Crudely crafted dialogue, garish, noisy, obnoxious characters, scenes cobbled together to have a natural feel but come out feeling jumbled and ugly. A car / driving movie, with a wisp of a build-up to a climax and you are left with a ""Meh.. wtf.. blah."" feeling.

George C. Scott is serviceable and I am glad I watched this. However I cannot recommend this to anyone. It is not pleasant in any way whatsoever.",1424390400,2,645,4.420168067226891

4887796,5,B005SYZYZ4,"Very good film but a very dark mood film a very organic film noir with a very tragic ending.

4887803,5,B005SYZYZ4,"Another early, but masterfully-done film with George C. Scott. I'd seen this film decades ago when it first came out, and it was just as fun to watch this time as it was decades ago! My favorite line was ""You wanna go on being able to brush your teeth, you'd better learn to keep 'em covered!!"" Great early Scott film - well worth seeing it again! The DVD ordered came defective - it froze up several times towards the middle of the film - hopefully my next copy will be a lot better.",1397779200,2,484,4.21505376344086

Not on par with The Getaway, Bullit or The French Connection, but if you love those films like I do, The Last Run scratches that itch just fine.",1391558400,4,272,4.230769230769231

4887806,4,B005SYZYZ4,I saw this years ago.  It still works. George C. Scott was a great in. This existentialist drama still holds after all these years.,1390953600,,131,4.458333333333333
4887807,4,B005SYZYZ4,"I walked into this movie about 45 minutes late as a middle schooler eagerly anticipating just another double bill a year or so after it was first released and enjoyed the hell out of it. Through the years, I'd felt a little hollow not knowing what I missed but was ecstatic to find it was recently released on DVD. Well, I bought the thing and wasn't exactly bowled over all these years later with the plotline I had missed way back when. Quite frankly, the first half of the movie drags, and little is given away as to who the three main characters are or why we should care. This negates any steam the film tries to muster in the remaining reels. A few comments in this forum have brought up a comparison to Bogart, but, no, George C. Scott aptly plays just another steady, thinking man's character while his career was in full swing on the heels of his Oscar win. And he's in fine form even if he doesn't have much of a role to settle into. The recently departed Tony Musante plays a flakey hitman whose a bit jumpy with his lines (sometimes Scott looks more preturbed with this actor's delivery than as the character reacting to it), and Trish Van Devere, Scott's soon-to-be real-life wife, is quaintly unruffled as the hitman's girl. It seems as if any young, attractive actress at the time could have played the part. That, coupled with a few widely scattered plot twists, one good explosion, and a too sudden finale that allows the wrong guy to get away can't save this modest actioner. At least Scott gave it a confident enough go.",1387497600,,1539,4.480427046263345
4887808,5,B005SYZYZ4,"I saw ""The Last Run"" upon its release in 1971 and it's wonderful that this fine movie finally found its way to dvd.  This is an under appreciated film that really deserves a wider audience.  George C. Scott's delivery here is as sublime and understated as was ""Patton"" an in your face and over the top performance.  That had much to do with the nature of the characters portrayed but Scott nailed them both.

The cinematography is compelling (hello? Sven Nykvist!) and the script is intelligently written.  The driving and chase scenes are truly exciting as it's nice to see a drama/action movie from the days before special effects took center stage at the expense of fine acting.

This movie has the gritty feel of real reality and it is one of those rare movies that one can enjoy again and again.",1386979200,,800,4.598591549295775
8485655,2,B005SYZYZ4,"All in all, this movie drags. The first half seems without focus and as a viewer I never got involved with any of the characters. Hard to say even if Scott was all that interested in the character he was playing. More or less an adequate B movie (ok for late night TV); a B movie means at least all the participants were competent, no real clunkers. The bedroom scene with Scott came out of nowhere, and then later the script took all that away again. Oh hum.",1502496000,,459,4.2272727272727275
8485656,3,B005SYZYZ4,I expected more from MR Scott,1487635200,,29,4.0
8485657,5,B005SYZYZ4,"George C. Scott is the real reason to see this picture. An intimate portrayal of retired mobster driver/runner Harry Garmes, and certainly one of Scott's best performances. The other reason to see The Last Run (1971) is the last true love of his character's life, his 1957 BMW 503. They are partners, and after 9 years of quiet retirement in Portugal, (filmed on location in and around Malaga), Garmes is feeling the old love of the chase surfacing again.

Lonely, bored and disappointed in the realities of retired life, Scott's character longs for purpose and action once again. He accepts an assignment to pick up a young hit man sprung from prison, and transport him (and unexpectedly his girlfriend, too) across the border from Spain into France. Of course, the prospect of 'one last run' in the tradition of his former profession excites Garmes, and his tuning and tinkering with his vintage supercharged sports car and gun once again become relevant for him... we sense his pride and sense of purpose cautiously returning.

The chase scenes, especially between Garmes with his old but supercharged BMW and the hit mens' new Jaguar XJS, are superb, without the special effects permeating films made since, and the whole movie somehow conveys a ""vintage"" and authentic feel, from Garmes' leather flight jacket to his supercharged old friend and partner. His sensitive acting is a study in an empathetic yet unsympathetic portrayal of Garmes, and George C. Scott fans will not be disappointed.

The downside of the picture is the at times ponderous and clumsy direction, and also the other characters, (excepting Colleen Dewhurst, who in a near cameo is at her earthy and gritty best). The picture has an overtone of at times depressing realism, and this might well have triumphed under skillful direction. John Huston began the film from all accounts, and it's a pity he didn't complete the picture. The pace drags at times, and there are a few truly awful and lame scenes, especially the incredibly disappointing and mawkish ending, which Huston never would have permitted. (If it weren't for these, this could have been a great film.) But the script and dialogue are enjoyable, and if you can overlook the flaws and appreciate Scott's superb acting, his vintage sports car, and the chase scenes, it is a memorable movie.",1474329600,,2327,4.976863753213368
8485658,4,B005SYZYZ4,"Good, cool understated thriller. Not for this generations ""Fast and Furious"" crowd, but the stunt driving in this movie just flat out cool. George C Scott and Tony Musante work well together and the movie just works!",1467158400,,216,4.864864864864865
