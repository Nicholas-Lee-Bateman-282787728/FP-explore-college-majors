The plot is ""Mousse captures Akane to lead Ranma to him so he can defeat Ranma and become Shampoo's wife...and Shampoo agrees to date Mousse if he beats Ranma, but she gives Mousse a trick weapon so he loses, even after he gives up Shampoo's weapon and starts using his own. However, after Mousse puts up a great fight but loses, Shampoo comes and turns him into a duck and carries him home into the sunset amid sad music! YAY!"" There are quite a few Ranma and Akane scenes here, as well as a SHAMPOO and MOUSSE scene...aww...I am only giving this 4 stars because as Cyberella said, the animation could have been better, but the plot was teriffic! I highly recommend this.",998352000,2,710,4.427480916030534
