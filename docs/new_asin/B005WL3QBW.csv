4899395,1,B005WL3QBW,"""My research has led me to believe.""... ""I have become convinced..."" is all the evidence Foster Gamble offers for the conspiracy theories and bogus science presented in this movie.

Gamble assures ""free energy"" is available now from ""torus"" based devices, but the technology is suppressed by a small group of elite conspirators who seek world domination. And yet, later when he shows glimpses of the world we could create by defeating them, it is one in which energy is being generated by windmill farms and solar panels.

The conspirators also suppresses the truth about aliens from across the galaxy who visit us and leave messages in crop circles.

It's hard to imagine Foster and his cohorts actually believe all this, but his agenda is unclear. What intrigues me are specific political actions advocated to foil the conspiracy -- such as getting rid of the Federal Reserve, etc. Who is behind this film and what do they stand for?

EDITED TO ADD:

""Thrive"" is right about one thing.  It's true those concerned about climate change argue that only united action by international agreement will do any good.  But Foster takes a long jump from that to characterizing global warming as a hoax by an elite few that seek world domination, big brother, and stripping the individual of privacy and individual liberties.

In fact this video may be from the same Cornwall Alliance Group's ""Resisting the Green Dragon.""  That 12 minute piece makes the exact same argument -- climate change is a hoax and pretext to create a world government that strips us of our liberties.

Guess what - Cornwall Alliance is funded by the Heartland Institute which is funded by Exxon.

For all its bells and whistles, ""Thrive"" looks like just another Exxon climate denial video.

See for yourself.  If the link below doesn't work, search YouTube for ""Resisting the Green Dragon"".  Compare its scenario to ""Thrive"" - exactly the same.",1321574400,66,1911,4.93125
4899396,5,B005WL3QBW,Amazing. A Must See. Really. I'm looking forward to see where the seeds this movie plants blossom. Share it with everybody.. great christmas gift!!,1321488000,13,147,5.166666666666667
4899397,5,B005WL3QBW,"I actually caught this on YouTube after someone had uploaded it and before it was taken down.  I'm now here to purchase my own copy to share with my friends and family.  This should be on everyone's gift list this holiday season because nothing is more valuable than the truth!

I woke up 4 1/2 years ago after discovering and listening to Alex Jones and his hundreds of informative and knowledgeable guests.  I highly recommend his show to those who enjoy this film as he has covered every topic in detail over the years on his daily program. There is even a clip from his 2007 documentary, ""Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement"" in this movie.

The reality of the world as we've been taught our entire lives is merely and illusion designed to keep us all in perpetual debt slavery to the global banking cartels and corporations that run it all.  This film blows the lid off the lies and deception that have kept us in this invisible prison for our minds.  Everyone needs to see this film because if that were to happen, we could get this world back on track, end the wars and global hunger in very short order.  We all need to AWAKEN the the TRUTH and the reality of the world and stop being led like lambs to the slaughter by the global ""elite"" and their controlled media which manipulates our minds, opinions and therefore, actions.  Our decisions are only as good as the information on which they are based.

The great thing about this documentary is the solutions it offers.  Unlike the Zeitgeist movement which offers a utopian and Marxist type of solution where a computer runs the world (but never tells us who PROGRAMS the computer), this documentary emphasizes individual liberty, restrained government, TRUE free markets (not monopoly capitalism destroying our world), and cooperation among people and nations in the absence of ridiculous and endless wars which only benefit the global ""elite"" and corporations at the great expense of millions paid in lives and massively oppressive taxes.

Don't fall prey to the paid Counter Intelligence Programs (cointelpro) and disinformation agents out there trying ""debunk"" to dissuade you from watching this movie. The establishment and powers that be have every interest in keeping this information from the masses.  Watch this movie and make up your own mind.  What makes more sense?  The way things are now, or the way they could be if everyone got on board with reality and worked towards peaceful solutions to all of our problems?",1321488000,20,2493,4.832941176470588

We found it for free on the internet, but are buying several copies here to give as gifts to our friends.  Well done. Well done.",1321401600,18,387,4.202702702702703
4899399,5,B005WL3QBW,"Highly researched and documented, this movie connects the dots and follows the money trail to look at who and what runs the world and the hidden agendas that have now been exposed.
This is a movie of hope and solutions to the crises that is coming to head as we enter a new age of consciousness. The production is first rate with wonderful graphics that make the facts come alive.
Foster Gamble born to privileged family related to Proctor and Gamble, knows the inside world of the elite and has rejected it to come forward with blockbuster of a movie to expose the power structures that are suppressing so many lifesaving cures and solutions. The culture as a whole as been asleep to this and will be shocked if they have internalized the corporate media's view of reality. This movie is a wake-up call to action to reclaim our power as the people to overthrow all that would keep us in chains and rob us of our humanity. Please watch with an open mind and use the thrive website to check out sources etc.  I think this is movie has made an important and perhaps historical contribution to getting out of the mess the world finds itself in. This movie is going to make those in power very angry, as these 1% of people in power don't like to be outed.
I think Foster has been very courageous in putting these issues forward to the benefit of humanity.
I highly recommend this movie.",1321401600,50,1382,4.462450592885376
4899400,5,B005WL3QBW,"Q:  What do you give the Family that owns nearly everything already?  A:  Nothing;  they'll just take the rest of it themselves, thank you.  It's the Last Christmas, and all of us are neatly wrapped under their shining tree!

No matter where you come down on the Illuminati Conspiracy, this is empowering, must-see filmmaking, unlike anything you'll have seen before - a combination call-to-arms and Disney ride.  Producer/director/star Gamble (himself a scion of a Proctor & Gamble family) and his co-host wife, attempt to connect the dots in a plausible, powerful way -- the suppression of Tesla's free-energy discoveries; the harassment, ruin, and even murder of inventors working in this area in ways that threaten Big Oil; the patient but inexorable reorganization of the world's nation-states into fewer and fewer continental ""unions"" (for easier conquest and control, the film concludes); the clockwork prosperity/depression cycles that permit bankers to scoop up the world's assets at fire sale values time and again; the puppet-string manipulation of both American political parties so that those in real control can never lose an election; all of it is covered here in this longish but riveting film.  Its release just comes as the NYPD attempts to shut down the Occupy Wall Street protests, in the wee hours and under a press blackout - perfect and ironic timing!  In the film's view, humanity is at a critical crossroads, and the choices are enslavement or waking up.  Is it all true?  If it is, this is probably about the best case that can be made for it, as well as a clarion cry to resist.",1321401600,316,1605,4.97378277153558
4899401,5,B005WL3QBW,"I watched THRIVE as an online stream, and then purchased the DVD to share with friends and family.  I am also in contact with the local library--to lobby for a public showing.

The film is very well produced and features terrific graphics, but it is the content that is most impressive.  We stand at a crossroads in human history--like no period before this.  THRIVE makes clear the choice--sleep into slavery or awaken into a level of existance beyond mere survival.  The agenda of the slave masters is nothing short of horrific.  The history of their process is well documented.  Yet, even here in the US, we outnumber them a million to one [according to the movie].

We have the tools to blossom into our potential, and the producers provide web support for those who want to implement a future of peace and prosperity for all.

4899411,1,B005WL3QBW,"Was this 'feature' supposed to be a 'laugh' or 'serious'.

Its' an incredibly 'po-faced' attempt at 'curing' the world's 'ills' by eradicating 'big government' and living by the ""law-of-TORUS"".
TORUS is the 'free-energy' we can ALL access - but for the intervention of 'multiconglomerate-corporations' we can't.

This 2hour long 'documentary' is presented by the apparent heir of the 'Proctor and Gamble' pharmaceutical empire going by the nom-de-plume Foster Gamble. He presents well UNproven facts such as 'crop-circles' to validate his claims almost as soon as the feature begins (and that's when I immediately became 'suspicious').

He later brings in his 'wife' to validate his 'claims', which should always sound the alarm bells; but when Deepak Chopra showed up, THAT WAS THE FINAL NAIL FOR ME.

I'm all for a world without government intervention at every turn, but the fact is that these 'powers' were constructed to inhibit the 'strong' from overpowering the 'weak'.

The feature proposes a 'wonderfully utopian world without government/corporate power' spoiling the 'naturally creative world of man'. A Pipe-Dream? You betcha.

All in all, as I asked at the start of this review: is this a 'laugh' or 'serious'. Well, I'd say it's really a good laugh if the serious 'problems' it 'addresses' weren't just that.

If you can find a really, really 'cheap' version of this documentary then I suggest you see the TORUS model for its wonderful insight.",1483574400,,1457,5.227467811158799

4899432,3,B005WL3QBW,"I Just saw Thrive On U tube, while the graphics are amazing and the topics are quite educational I find the conspiracy of all this just toooo Unbelievable. It is not just big government and big corporations that create an earth of suffering and pain but the main problem is also greedy human nature that  contributes to our worldwide dilemmas.
Sure big pharma, banking crooks and over reaching government are a serious issue but why do the ignorants continue to buy into all this and support the big corporate pigs and governments that perpetuate continual war. No one forces people to send their children off to war.  Why do they send their children to die in the ongoing wars and then say God Bless America when the government does not give a crap about Veterans? No one is forcing them to send their children to the slaughter to kill and destroy communities in other countries. I wonder why the continued war and imperialism of the USA is not mentioned in Thrive? In fact little time is given to the continued destruction of the human race by war in this movie.
There is little mention of the human instinctual condition or of any psychological or sociological theory. How can they make a movie such as this about the destruction of the human race; and leave out any examination of humanity and the instincts of humankind and what it is about people that allows them to fall into the so called traps that the elite set up. Good Question.

Yes I believe that people are like sheep being led to the slaughter because most of humanity are sheep followers not leaders. If we taught more about leadership  and standing up for human rights in our schools and homes maybe the ""sheep mentality would change"". However people would rather let someone make their decisions rather then standing up for what they believe.

All we need to do is to raise our consciousness and gain some real guts to be leaders of our own destiny.  This  movie can help to open some eyes but I seriously doubt most of the ""whole world is controlled by a few theory"" that Thrive purports.
I can only give this movie 3 stars for content and the conspiracy theory that the elite and government are responsible for all the ills in the world.
I can give it 5 stars only because it may At least  get people to finally think.",1445040000,,2289,4.538834951456311

4899468,3,B005WL3QBW,This movie does not support much of its own thesis with actual evidence. However either do the debunkers of the same topics. Take for example UFO's. There actually is a substantial amount of evidence that they exist and most likely come from somewhere else. What ever they are they have propulsion system(s) far different than anything we may have now based upon their observed flight behaviors. There is also evidence that there may be some cover up about this. Both the movie and some of its detractors do not go into any detail about this particular subject. Instead you are left with unsubstantiated believes on both sides. Other subjects in the movie are dealt with in the same manner. However it does not mean that there is not some kernel of truth in the movies suggestions about certain topics it covers. It is worth viewing just to get another perspective but not as an evidential documentary.,1410048000,,902,4.788461538461538

A friend recommended this for me to see. His insights are missing as he passed away. His primary insight was that people will choose sides and this film offers a great way to see clearly each side before the predicted catastrophe arrives.

The concept that you must own or take it all fails to address the underlying concept that America is built upon...American ingenuity and the creative genius in all. The world is full of commodity limitations. Industry must adopt itself to seek answers in uncommon places and look to create new solutions. Solar energy is a great example. Vaccines that prevent the need for long term medications is another example.

Smarter houses with built in energy efficiency to slow load growth in major cities and allow many to use almost no additional energy other than the solar panels on their roofs or cisterns in the ground for water collection. Food gardens on rooftops or trees planted as part of a longer term food solution. The minds are present on the earth at the same time to solve many of the problems faced in insolvency, shortages, pandemics, and other predicted world disasters. World leadership offers many solutions that are dismissed as too easy due to failures in the monetary system as the cheese is moved or the tipping point is shockingly technology oriented for many in a world that prefer to avoid technical solutions.",1405814400,2,1598,4.846153846153846

If only we could get EVERYONE to view it.!!  I do not like the 'new-agey' feel to it and it's ending ""solutions"" are most likely impossible since the web of deception we have garnered over the years is much too deep.  Albeit, I did appreciate the work he put into it all & I did have at least a 'temporary' positive approach to the situation.  Like Kimberly Gamble said in this movie, she felt like she had the flu for 2 weeks when she was awakened to all this corruption.  I've researched all this stuff and these elitists for over 10 years so I knew all the info, but I felt like he wrapped it all up in a nutshell overall.  I sent it to lots of my email contacts with the warning that it was 'new-agey', but I just wish folks would wake up to all that's been going on for centuries... and longer in actuality.  We can't address what we refuse to know!  I must say the end result of this that gives me great joy is reading all the reviews and the concern & possible answers to this tragedy... 'listening' to all the minds that actually have a working brain is what impresses me the most, regardless of whether I agree with their point of view or not.

4899493,5,B005WL3QBW,"I finally got around to watching this tonight while assembling a makeshift fit-desk which I'm using as I type this. (Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from another Amazon reviewer; so far I've comfortably pedaled 22 miles and love the set-up! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O6TXVS/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QA0EHI/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This film had been on my mind for a couple of weeks ever since a very interesting guy I sat next to on a Southwest flight recommended it. He, an MD, and I were talking about all manner of thought provoking subjects and he seemed extremely intelligent and sincere, so I had a feeling it was going to be good. I had no idea it would be this good. The film completely blew my mind! It dares to ask the question of why human beings are not thriving despite the resources and scientific advances currently available to us and concludes that the powerful ""elite"" are actually preventing us from working together for the greater good. With carefully researched details, these brave souls describe how specific individuals are hording more wealth than they (and everyone they know) could ever possibly use by progressively robbing the hard-working, tax-burdened masses through such tactics as creating the Federal Reserve Bank, deliberately orchestrating catastrophes such as the stock market crash/great depression and the housing collapse/big bank bail-outs, as well as covering up scientific advances that could free us of our dependence on fossil fuels by silencing great scientists such as Tesla. They address a lot of other fascinating topics as well, and it's all done in a positive and uplifting fashion meant to inspire hope and unify the masses (except for the brief sad vignette in the beginning showing examples of how we as a species are not thriving) . Of mention, there is a youtube video that claims this film is illuminati propaganda. I watched the first 5 minutes of that and it uses the opposite approach--fear tactics--to motivate people to dismiss this film without giving it a chance by claiming it serves the purposes of the very elite it speaks out against. ""Thrive"" concludes with practical steps that everyone can take to shift the power back into the hands of the people. Before writing this off as a conspiracy theory (or propaganda, which is a preposterous claim), open your heart and mind and take the time to watch it, see for yourself and spread the word.",1399507200,,2494,5.313924050632911

4899496,5,B005WL3QBW,"This is one of the most informative documentaries I have ever seen.  It is slightly difficult to watch for anyone who is just waking up to the truth about the world we live in.  It covers some of the secrets of the World Banks (reminding me of Confessions of an Economic Hitman).  This documentary exposes the real objective of the few who hold the power, mind-blowing crop circles and the hidden agenda of the not-so alien aliens.  What really impressed me about this documentary is that the creator, narrator of the film (Foster Gamble) offers real solutions to the ongoing travesty that plagues this country, and that this overwhelming fear and control can be combatted with proper knowledge and lasting solutions.  What also adds to this well filmed documentary is that these are real people, some who haved formerly worked with the government, and some that are just educated scientists who know about the energy of the torus and the sacred geometry of life.  I have watched a myriad of documentaries about these subjects and more and I continue to be impressed by how many braves souls are willing to expose these corrupt individuals. Lastly, the documentary gives all people the inspiration and hope to make global changes, starting with their own communities, spreading out to make a difference in the world.  We have the power to change, to pursue happiness, to lift ourselves and our communities to a higher state of being, to a higher consciousness...and it all starts with knowledge and love.",1397174400,4,1504,4.897637795275591

I read an average of 65-70 books a year and it is refreshing to watch a video practically describing a lot of the things I have read. I communicated with Foster to ask him how he could possibly reconcile his current belief system with the fact that he belongs to a family (Procter and Gamble) who produces products that harm people and our planet. Foster e-mailed me back and I was satisfied with what he had to say for himself. His work resonates well with me.

4899509,1,B005WL3QBW,"There are aspects of this film that many will find appealing,
like its support for organic farming and credit unions.
However, much of its agenda is that of paleoconservatives and the right-wing,
conspiratorial John Birch Society.  Moreover, the Thrive website promotes
anarcho-capitalism and theories that climate change is a ""hoax.""
There is a lot about this film that is misleading and manipulative; so much so, that several
people (Amy Goodman, John Perkins, Vandana Shiva, Deepak Chopra, others) interviewed in
it wrote a public letter published in Yes! Magazine disassociating themselves from the final film.
Part of their letter, ""Disaster by Design: What's Wrong with the 'Thrive' Movement"" reads:
We are a group of people who were interviewed for and appear in the movie Thrive, and who hereby publicly disassociate ourselves from the film.  Thrive is a very different film from what we were led to expect when we agreed to be interviewed. We are dismayed that we were not given a chance to know its content until the time of its public release. We are equally dismayed that our participation is being used to give credibility to ideas and agendas that we see as dangerously misguided.  We stand by what each of us said when we were interviewed. But we have grave disagreements with some of the films content and feel the need to make this public statement to avoid the appearance that our presence in the film constitutes any kind of endorsement.

Foster Gamble explores some very interesting ideas about taurus energy fields and the US monetary system. While digital elements of the video are amusing and some of the explanation winds its way from cumbersome to tiresome, this video was nonetheless interesting, always entertaining and at times, disturbing.

The reason I gave this 4 stars versus 3 three is because Mr. Gamble does an excellent job explaining the US Monetary System and breaks down the otherwise difficult economic scheme into language even a 5 year-old can comprehend.

4899518,4,B005WL3QBW,"Some of these reviews talk about the conspiracy theories delivered by this very deep film. These other reviewers lash out at the message delivered, saying that much of it is another form of propaganda. They say that all of the information offered here is its own form of bullsh-t for the gullible to soak up and wallow in. The reviews that deliver these views are their own form of propaganda and bullsh-t because they want you to believe THEM because they rely on their own form of propaganda!

I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is propaganda because it is just information delivered in a straight message for the viewers to make their own decisions. In fact, they offer ways and places to go to interact in your own ways to make a better existence on this planet. We, as a people, are always looking for a way to make a difference in the world and in THRIVE, the message is offered that you can do so in whatever way you want through various ways, both monetary or humanitarian.....and many more, different ways.

I found the movie to a very good way to figure out what avenues I have to study and take a closer look at finding a way to make my own difference in the world. With compelling facts and suppositions and through the views of several luminaries, whether a complete transformation is the key or even just tweaking the things I do to make baby steps at creating a clearer vision of what can be done by me..........or by you........to really feel good about what you are doing here on the planet....this is one place you can go to to find the answers you are searching for. THEN, with the things you learn through THRIVE, you can make your own conclusions about how to move forward in your life.
I'll need to watch THRIVE again to get deeper into it because the filmmakers deliver a great deal of information along with many solutions for creating a better world to live in. The naysayers who are so against this movie didn't bother to take the time to realize that there are many views that do support the information offered here....in order to make positive changes to move forward: their views are so negative that they refuse to believe ANY of the info here. Their mistake, not mine.

So, if you've been put off by the naysayers, who rant about the ""conspiracy theories"" stated in the movie....push those folks aside because they are only here to have you buy into their own misguided theories about the information stated in the movie. I say WATCH THRIVE................and draw your own conclusions because you just may find a different way to approach the way you walk through this life, whether it is a small change in your life...or something monumental that helps you break free of the chains that hold you back. Watch THRIVE and draw your own conclusions because you have a brain to process all of its information: ""What you believe is possible and is determined by your worldview.""

I really liked the approach of Foster Gamble his presentation was exciting I could not leave the room. It was a little far out, yet the more I watched the movie the more it made sense. I find it interesting that the media hasn't gotten a hold of it, makes you wonder! I keep telling everyone about the video & I encourage them to purchase their own copy so they can turn others onto the contents. This is something that we all need to hear about in this day & age.

Some of it is creepy, only because most of us don't want to believe that we are part of some big 'manipulation game'.
Also, there are some other factors that they discuss that appear supernatural.

I walked away saying 'WOW'. Not only was it interesting and informative, but it did answer some questions.

If you choose to believe, you can do research to see if it is BULL. I recommend doing so; you may be surprised.

If you choose not to believe, than you can chalk it up to someone's opinion, modified to make it look like truth.

It is kinda long, so bring snacks and be fully awake when watching it. There are lots of details and info that will escape you if you watch it late at night or tired. You really don't want to miss the details. Also, stick with it after the first 15-20 minutes-- it gets better and better. Don't think that they won't cover a full spectrum-- they will...

4899552,5,B005WL3QBW,"This film is truly a wake-up call to all of us, who are on the whole a population of dumbed-down, put-to-sleep people.  There is much, very much, that goes on and, in fact, rules our everyday experience in Western Civilzation that we're almost completely asleep to.  ""Thrive"" is a successful, I would say, attempt to lay out these hidden interests and mechanisms in broad strokes -- to give us an accurate overview of them.  (In a word, these interests have essentially derailed human social, scientific, financial, and even spiritual progress without our even being aware of it).  The film also attempts to portray the amazing potential of human beings on this planet to not only survive, but to thrive socially, economically, and spiritually.  Having been a serious student of all these things for years, I judge Foster Gamble's evidence to be 95% accurate and trustworthy.  Judge for yourself.

Consider this: every time someone is labelled a conspiracy theorist, or something is labelled a conspiracy theory (or even just a conspiracy), people's minds get turned off.  They automatically placed that issue or person in the ""nut case"" category.  Why? Do we ever even see this, let along ask how and why this happens?  Could we have been conditioned to turn our attention away from issues, events, and people that it has been decided we shouldn't be aware of -- with just at the drop of a word or two?
A conspiracy is a concerted, covert effort of a group of people to further their own interests, usually at the expense of others.  Any student of history knows that history is bursting at the seams with conspiracies.  And yet we're asked to believe that this isn't so today.  Why?  Who would benefit from our continued inability or unwillingness to pull aside the curtain? -- the people hiding behind the curtain pulling the hidden levers of power, of course.  And make no mistake, they are there.

So ""Thrive"" pulls the curtain aside for us to have a look.  The ""Thrive"" website mentioned in the film provides resources to have a much deeper look -- for those who are willing to see things as they really are.",1367712000,,2114,4.779614325068871

At first I thought it was going to be in the vein of documentaries like ""The Secret"", or ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" (same kind of graphic tools, and metaphors of ""rabbit holes"" etc), but once I saw the crop circle pictures I was in a completely different space. These images are both amazing and boggling, and yet comfortingly convincing of the larger intelligent and beautiful nature of Life (of this world and others).

From the basis of the universal torus pattern (donut shape flow pattern found throughout nature in mirco and macro scales), and the connection (interconnection) to the rest of the universe (extraterrestrial life-forms), we see how we are at the cusp of a new relationship to the universe (new age, which today, 12-12-12, could well be the official portal of), and the challenges we face in getting there (the powerful New World Order elites who are working to block this awakening)....

Let me leave it at that. There is much to do - to discover, to experience, to create. It is a vast universe and we have the future to explore it - but we need to take responsibility, consciously (individually empowered). This documentary gives a great introduction to some of these challenges, and gives us a beautifully inclusive model (torus) and vision of our place in the whole to pursue it.

4899615,5,B005WL3QBW,"""Thrive"" is an extremely curious movie, narrated by Foster Gamble, the founder of the Thrive Movement.

""Thrive"" begins as a soft-core, New Age-inspired movie about free energy, crop circles, ancient astronauts and UFOs. Gamble talks about his spiritual experience of Wholeness and something he calls ""the torus"", which he believes is the fundamental pattern of the universe. Gamble speculates that ""the torus"" was known by ancient civilizations, which got the knowledge from highly evolved space aliens. The torus can be used to create unlimited amounts of free energy, which will solve our energy crisis once and for all, ushering in an era of unlimited prosperity and growth.

If you are a sceptic, things go rapidly downhill from there...

Gamble suddenly claims that many inventors of free energy have been harassed or even murdered.

After about 40 minutes, ""Thrive"" turns out to be a hard-line conspiracy theory production. It features both David Icke and D. Edward Griffin. The latter is a member of the John Birch Society. Gamble believes that the world is ruled by a powerful elite of banking families, most notably the Rockefellers and the Rotschilds. Their agenda is to set up a New World Order, an international military dictatorship based on mass surveillance technology, debt slavery and grinding poverty. The ultimate goal of the agenda is to kill off a vast portion of the human race through forced sterilization, man-made pandemics, and so on. Yes, really!

In contrast to many other conspiracists, Gamble ends on a positive note. He offers solutions to our predicament, solutions which turn out to be an eclectic blend of communitarianism, libertarianism and something that sounds like Green left-liberalism. A ten-point program is advanced, and people are called upon to take non-violent action against the conspiracy, in the traditions of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi. ""Thrive"" ends as it began, with a vague spiritual message, based on aikido and Buddhist meditation.

Although Foster Gamble, his lovely wife and their Thrive Movement isn't exactly my cup of tea, I admit that I was weirdly fascinated by this film. It presents a very extreme and controversial message in an incredibly laid back, soft and even slightly respectable manner. Gamble has convinced many reputable non-conspiracists to appear on his show, including Deepak Chopra and Vandana Shiva. ""Thrive"" is incredibly well produced, suggesting that someone with substantial means have contributed to the project. My guess is that it's Gamble himself, since he belongs to one of the families which owns Procter & Gamble. The narrator is at pains to distance himself from anti-Semitism and anti-Black racism (several of the people interviewed are Black, including Foster's aikido trainer). He takes the side of the American Indians against the settlers, while claiming to be an avid student of Ludwig von Mises. Not a bad job, certainly not for a person who is on a first-name basis with David Icke...

I will give ""Thrive"" five stars, not because I agree with its analysis or political program, but because it's so charismatic and intriguing. It's also available for free, both at the movement's website and at Youtube - in 20 different languages.

This is conspiracy theory deluxe.",1350000000,2,3277,5.216730038022813

4899620,2,B005WL3QBW,"I am very well versed in the law of thermodynamics.  I am also a mystic, so I read quite a bit about the unseen.  I like to keep a balance between both - as it can be easy to get carried away.  This movie has gone so far into the unseen, it is worth nothing.  Essentially it's a WHOLE LOT of speculation, fancy graphics, and extremely poor science.  Yeah, they do have some interesting facts, but they thoroughly mix it with phony.  What bugs me about this movie is that is pretends to have a scientific outlook of several topics, while it does not. The most obvious is the government conspiracy about shutting down ""anti gravity"" research along with ""free energy generators"".  What a giant load. Oh of course they don't say anything about how they work.  Just a bunch of ""oh it it's going to be SOOOOOO nice"" and ""oh the goverment is so mean"".  Mind you, I'm no fun of the government, but they are just using people's distrust of the government to create the idea that there is this magical device.  There is no such thing as free energy - you can't get more energy out of a system than what the system already contains or is already going into it (Law of thermodynamics).  This device, apparently built by one of the people interviewed, ""was shut down by the government"".  Oh, and I guess he can't build another?  LOL.  Get this, I am not against the idea of using our minds to create some sort of device that may run on some sort of yet-to-be-understood frequency - but the fact that they didn't say ANYTHING about how this device worked, or how any of the solutions really worked goes to show that they are just fluffing a whole lot of nothing...

Save your time and money and watch a good movie like What the Bleep do we Know or Discover the Gift.  (some people like The Secret, but i found it to be too focused on 'how to amass wealth' ... meh, they missed the point in my opinion)",1346544000,10,1887,4.318181818181818

4899622,4,B005WL3QBW,"After watching Thrive, I liked it a lot.  It was eclectic and well produced to be enjoyable viewing.  I view people as passing thru different phases in their awakening.  We all are brainwashed in the mind control of Skool.  It takes a long effort at reversing that mind control to awaken for some, less for others, and some never will see with clarity the deception forced upon them.  We are a large slave plantation and a very small group are the ""masters"".  If, not, then why would anyone voluntarily pay the IRS their assets?  Only slaves can be forced to do things against their will, and yet all Americans do just that on a daily basis. The first stage of awakening is to realize that the government is lying constantly and the media is a propaganda machine to dispense those lies.  Next although there is a Constitution, that prohibits the government agents [servants] from doing bad things to the beneficiary's of the public trust, they are never punished for violating their 'oaths of office'. Until we start to realize that we are by nature free and it is a violently enforced evil that masquerades as a Government we cannot claim to see with clarity what is going on.
My approach to solutions is wildly different from the ones in Thrive.  My solution is that all who wish to have freedom must be the change and enforce the LAW on those who have usurped unlawfully the authority to violate our rights.  We do not live in a DEMOCRACY, we, by law, live in a REPUBLIC and if one does not know the difference and the LAW, they will be helpless to be anything but a slave.

4899623,4,B005WL3QBW,"In the documentary film/info trailer for his website, ""Thrive,"" Foster Gamble of Proctor & Gamble fame and his wife, Kimberley Carter Gamble feel that the problems of the world can be greatly reduced by exploring the possibilities of inexpensive energy sources and go on to theorize about why the world has not embraced this simple fact.  The Gambles' theories do make some sense, but unfortunately in this two-hour venue, the information they impart seems inconclusive and needs further analysis, perhaps even subsequent films that delve into each of the multitudinous topics that this attempts to address.  The resulting documentary does connect the dots, but leaves many unanswered questions.

In the first portion of 'Thrive,' Gamble concentrates on a mathematical three-dimensional surface called the torus which resembles a donut shape. Gamble stresses all organisms utilize energy in the same way that the torus does--it funnels energy through the top of the hole and out of the the bottom and balloons out of the sides to create this dynamically functioning breathing bundle of energy.  Gamble, with the use of a fantastic and sophisticated graphics that Walt Disney and his land of the Future would covet, demonstrates the connection between this type of energy, ancient engineering, crop circles and unidentified flying saucers. From there he points out that perhaps alien spacecraft provided a means of transportation for some other significantly more intelligent life force that at one time through the the use of the torus shape and other sacred geometric shapes imparted knowledge to the people of earth that would ensure their ability to thrive.  He has a number of experts expound upon this eventually segueing into how the government has suppressed knowledge of such things to the public.  This allows him to introduce the idea of government suppression of other things--like a cure for cancer and other inventions by men like Tesla and Rife who created machines that would benefit mankind but would make other more lucrative treatments and machines obsolete and no longer profit-making for the mega corporations that produce and advocate them.  He comments that these innovative geniuses and others like them were beaten or killed to prevent word of their discoveries from becoming mainstream.

It is predictable that at this junction in his discussion, he introduces the illuminati idea where a set group of people pretty much rule the world.  He names names,pointing fingers at the large banking families that he feels have global domination in mind.  He cites a variety of examples of this global power and then comments on what will actually happen if this comes to pass.  He stresses the need for connectivity to ascertain always being in the know (now) of what is going on.  He and his wife make some suggestions to help you surmount the snowballing momentum of in-control families that have and want to continue to control the world scene from a shadowy boardroom.  He urges each and everyone of us to take back our lives  and renounce the slavery that is inherent in our economic system. His concluding suggestions include to an active participation on his website course--which is quite informative and will take some time for those interested to explore.

Gamble makes some valid points in his rather spectacular two hour presentation.  However, he needs to connect the dots a little better--I had seen another documentary called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Money-Masters-How-International-Bankers-Gained-Control-of-America/dp/B0018IPKCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Money Masters- How International Bankers Gained Control of America</a>on this subject of money that pretty much said the same thing---advocating the Von Mises system of economics (think Ron Paul) to rid our lives of the Federal Reserve.  In order to make a more cohesive argument, Gamble should expand all his talking points into full length films that continue to educate.

In Thrive, he jumps a bit from one thing--torus to aliens to government suppression to global dominance and the power of money---all of which could be presented in two hour segments of their own.  However, I do think his film is meant as an introduction into the problem.  I am not certain of how he wants to proceed from here once he makes his identifications.  One important observation that he makes and that I can testify to in my own strivings in my own life is that good ideas are squashed not by the banking elite or whomever is in control but by their vast minions--everyday people who buy into establishments, organizations and conformist roles that promise them success and keep the old ways in a paramount position in order to make these people money  and deem the newer, freer less profitable things the work of quacks and oddballs.  Case in point, a local cancer retreat supports my community with information that includes spiritual learnings, Reiki and healing touch massage and meditation.  A woman in the medical field fiercely condemns such practices as ""giving these patients false hope.""  Her stake in her own profession does not allow her to see any other helpful modality--its either medicine or nothing.  Closed mindedness?  Yes.  Yet this is what is there waiting for you when you are in dire need.  Not good.

As a more permanent solution, Gamble does suggest adhering to a bit of a game plan which he outlines in the film.  He suggests liberal programs initially to rid the governing bodies of their greed-driven advocates, followed up by more traditional controls that include smaller government.  He is counting on what he considers the good intentions of the mainstream to make it work.

Bottom line?  All in all, 'Thrive' is a good film with spectacular graphics that make complicated mathematics interesting and applicable with regard to New Age ideas of energy and the future development of not only the human race, but our planet and our universe.  Foster Gamble and his wife Kimberley Carter Gamble suggest that as living organisms, we strive only to Thrive.  Recommended to those who need to shun the opinions of others and move on with their own purpose.

NWO 'deception agents'can't do that for you.
I feel that the last thing the people who produced this movie want , is an educated , informed , globally aware population.
Movies like Thrieve serve to distract people from attention to what's really going on.
Once people learn to read between the lines on movies like this they start to give themselves so much time that they suddenly have
extra amount of time every day......and are no longer losing time like before.
Listen to people like the ones who opposed the Bela Monte Dam , like the SOS Elephants of Chad people on Facebook and such individuals.
Those are the REAL spokespersons for the Earth , not fake mass media moguls who just throw stuff at you regardless of what you feel about it.
'David'is not out there doing those lectures 'for a living', but is being played by a guy who wants your money , not you to know the truth.
It's the same with 'Steven M. Greer'.
Remember when the FBI were asked to search for 'FBI Documents about Marilyn Monroe'?
They found no Document - and they found nobody registered officially under the name 'Marilyn Monroe' from the time period she was supposed to have
lived in.

4899630,5,B005WL3QBW,"Initially I had seen a short piece of Thrive about one year ago at a public showing at an organic rawfood restaurant in Nevada City, CA. The little bit I saw, which wasn't much, had stuck in my head because it had the ring of truth to it. The message of the film continued to resonate with me in the back of my mind. I finally purchased a copy on Amazon and watched it yesterday. Upon watching I realized I had already conducted my own independent research and connected the dots regarding 70% of the facts presented in the movie. That might sound like I'm saying the movie is not presenting much new information, but nothing could be farther from the truth. You see, I am, and always have been, a free thinker, in the 1% of the human race. I have rejected societies religions, diet, and philosophy. I know without uncertainty that the US medical institution, rich American diet, religious institutes, public schools, and politics are all a big connected lie foisted upon us since birth to create unthinking weak fearful shee-ple in order to make trillions for the elite. With that seemingly ""radical"" statement now made, I have to say that even I was almost unprepared for the genius of free thinking that this documentary represents. If you are awaking to the true possibilities of the human race, or even if you just want to watch a very entertaining film, than please buy this movie and share it with other free thinking people that you know. Here's another ""radical"" thought: A new human revolution has begun, where we are learning to get past the fear and wanting, and starting to really thrive for the first time in human history. Yes, the cynics will smear this as quackery because they don;t believe in their own goodness, or have been duped, but I for one am telling you, without fear or agenda, that they are the ones who are mistaken and our history will bear that out.

Thank you Foster Gamble, I too believe in our inherent goodness, despite what the news, religion, and ""they"" say, I see the goodness in us everyday, everywhere I go. That positive energy makes me feel confident that we will make the right choices about our future.

4899631,5,B005WL3QBW,"The Framers, at least those of who made significant contributions to our founding documents, were staunch advocates of republicanism and individualism. First, I should say, the message of the Tea Party is by no means a sufficient representation of the Framer's views. The party lays claim as a ""grassroots"" movement [a certainly vague concept], which allows the ignorance of its membership to spread far and wide. However, Neo-Conservatives make up a large part of this group. Neo-Cons are those who support an immoral foreign policy [nation-building and policing the world], and also tend to bring faith and religion [unconstitutionally] into the political arena.  They are the traditionalists and social conservatives who favor the status quo. They say they want small government, but then support policies and mandates that keep it growing. Typically, today's use of the term ""liberal"" means ""contrary to the status quo."" So hey, let's all be liberals if the status quo is ""Neo-Conservatism.""
What people do not understand is the difference between classical liberalism and modern day liberalism. U.S. Framers were NOT conservatives in their historical context of the term. Conservatives were those in support of centralized, monarchial rule [like Britain]. They were traditionalists or social conservatives [sound familiar?]. Our Framers were ""liberal"" because they were advocates of LIBERTY. Today's liberals however, are an advocate of a soul-killing socioeconomic philosophy [sorry, that may sound vituperative], which elevates the ""Will"" of society, i.e., the collective good or welfare of the people, over the freedom of the individual. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, et cetera, were opposed to that idea, be it the Will of God, the Will of a group, or the Will of King-freedom means the inviolate sanctity of the individual.
 When the framers of the American republic spoke of ""the people,"" they did not mean a collectivist organism one part of which was authorized to consume the rest. They meant a sum of individuals, each of whom--whether strong or weak, rich or poor--retains his inviolate guarantee of individual rights. Throughout history the state had been regarded, implicitly or explicitly, as the ruler of the individual--as a sovereign authority (with or without supernatural mandate), an authority logically antecedent to the citizen and to which he must submit. The Founding Fathers challenged this primordial notion. They started with the premise of the primacy and sovereignty of the individual. The individual, they held, logically precedes the group or the institution of government. Whether or not any social organization exists, each man possesses certain individual rights. And ""among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""--or, in the words of a New Hampshire state document, ""among which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; and in a word, of seeking and obtaining happiness.""
In other words government is to be a neutral institution, one that must never deal with opinion or preference, but only with action; namely, to protect individuals against force and fraud, and to promote and protect trade. It [government] must never endorse race or religion. An individual is FREE. He or she may be a racist and a bigot who claims there is no god but the Christian god; he or she may be a well-educated and thoughtful atheist [like myself] who craves economic freedom and civil liberty for their country; he or she may be flamboyantly homosexual and recycle too much. Doesn't matter. The government is not to be in the business of determining or favoring social values. People and government officials should also look up the difference between a Democracy and a Republic. The constitution protects individuals and states' rights. The U.S. is still a Republic, even if our political process is democratic. The American public has a great deal to learn and let's hope they do before the next election.

Needless to say the proof of the pudding is the current state of affairs both brought to you by the democrats and republicians. These two parties try to demonize people who love liberty. They have people believing that the income tax , soccial security were all good things and they made us all poor and stole out property. The simple facts are if you keep your entire income you would be in charge. With 70000 pages of tax code and 400000 pages of business regulation and hidden taxes etc. The price of all goods in the country are double and tripe. Imagine how well the economy would be without them. Now we have aevil govt and big business who had to play ball with the evil govt. Less laws more freedom period. The income tax was never meant to raise revenue it was meant to tye your property to the federal govt. There are better ways to raise taxes. Democrat ignorance as killed a great nation. Rich democrats and republicains. Your proof is the history. My proof has and will never be tried.

4899646,3,B005WL3QBW,"I did like several things about this movie, including its examination of alternative energy, a critique of the current medical paradigm, its first-rate use of graphics, and a consideration that there is a better way that eschews the scarcity mentality/competition status quo and embraces the cooperation/collaboration model.  However, I don't think Foster Gamble spells out an accurate solution to counter the supposed ""endgame"" of the global elite.  Firstly, I don't think there is a deliberate Global takeover stratagem in place, more just a bunch of greedy corporations run by CEOs who influence political policies for their financial benefit (though I could stand corrected).  Secondly, cutting taxes on these corporations is hardly the solution; compound that inept proposal by then further undermining anti-monopoly laws/business corruption exposes by allowing for no government intervention if corruption is made obvious (I exaggerate here, as Gamble doesn't ask to completely eliminate government, but greatly reduce its role).  I totally agree that big business has infiltrated and unduly influences government, yet we still need some governing body to enforce legal ramifications.  We are not yet in a phase of human evolution where we don't need some sort of intermediary ruling body to intervene on behalf of the public good.  The government is far from perfect, but the Ron Paul agenda is not a fit replacement.

If we could develop meter-less energy, that would certainly help spur on the advancement of humanity and help curb human suffering.  This would threaten and uproot a lot of industries, but in the long run, it would be in everyone's best interest to share the world's resources and tap into limitless, renewable energy.  Is the science in this movie accurate and credible?  I don't know.  I enjoy learning about science, but am hardly an expert.  Did aliens from advanced civilizations give us some major clues with the Taurus shapes appearing in crop circles and inexplicably etched in the Osirian Temple rocks and other sacred structures?  This sounds implausible, as our visitors would have to outsmart the speed of light conundrum (the movie suggests they worked out wormhole short-cuts, like in the film, ""Contact""). Again, I don't know.  Very interesting to ponder, but I am hardly a believer at this point.

The part of the movie that I most enjoyed was its indictment on Big Pharma and suppressing alternative medical therapies.  I've been watching a lot of documentaries on Netflix about this theme lately--mostly regarding the Gerson therapy for cancer treatment.  Also, the documentary ""Food Matters"" suggests that high dose therapy of Vitamin C (up to 200,000 mg) is far more effective than standard chemotherapy, as this mega-high vitamin dosage selectively kills cancer cells but leaves normal cells alone. Instead of nausea and losing body hair, patients only experience thirst and mild dizziness with the Vitamin C treatment. Umm, that's exactly what we want in cancer treatment.  If this is true and can be proven, it is CRIMINAL of pharmaceutical companies to suppress this information.  I don't get it---pharmacy company execs and their loved ones are just as vulnerable to cancer as everyone else.  Wouldn't they prefer this treatment for their family members, even if they can't patent a profit on it?  They can still tinker with forms of Vitamin C and the best way to deliver it intravenously to the bloodstream, so perhaps there is money to be made even in natural remedies.

I have to hand it to the graphics department in this movie---first rate.  Even if we don't know whether everything discussed in this movie is wholly accurate, the computer-generated illustrations helped us to visualize and better understand what the scientists and pundits were talking about. Even with the enlightening graphics, I don't know enough about economics to agree or disagree with the elaborate conspiracy theories being made.  I definitely agree there is unchecked corruption that the taxable public ultimately pays for.  Does that mean we should do away with taxes altogether?  Perhaps readjust tax structures so people who earn less than a certain amount do not have to pay income tax, but the rest of us should have to commensurately fund public necessities like education, police and fire protection, and so forth.  That we can all do this without taxes is ridiculous and beyond quixotic.  Also, the very corporations Gamble is indicting and blowing the whistle on would come out stronger and more powerful than ever if they had no corporate taxes (and as I previously mentioned, if there was no governing body to regulate them).  I don't get his logic here at all.  Feel free to enlighten me with a (preferably non-condescending) comment if I really am just missing the bigger picture or misinterpreted what he said during the last portion of the movie.  I totally agree with his call to return to our higher selves, to be cooperative instead of competitive, to learn from our mistakes instead of repeating them, and that there is enough for everyone if we will all share the Earth's resources.",1337990400,8,5135,5.158021712907117

This movie does a great job of tying together multiple conspiracy theories from sacred geometry as a means to derive free energy which started with Tesla and ended with miscellaneous amateur electronics garage inventors to ufo's, banking conspiracies, and vertically integrated bioagribusinesses' 'big plan' of genetic IP hegemony.  It elaborates these theories very well with high quality, pleasing wow-factor visuals.  Some of the interviewees were quite interesting characters.

I admit, there's a lot of fun stuff there, some of it likely true and I try to keep a very open mind, being I'm a witness of a daytime ufo while driving, dead sober, in great health and unaffected by any drugs or mental condition.

Having said that, the red herring here is the 'suppression of free energy devices' and that we didn't get see more about how these are made.  I mean what better way to spread these 'world changing' devices than to put the plans directly on this film and dvd, along with their other media assets.  Instant information desimination through your dvd distributer / amazon.com.  Or better yet, those inventors should post the plans on instructables.com or send to make magazine, because those are places where regular people would have the skill, motivation and community support to build these things.  If you think the government can suppress the entirety of the internet, then send the plans to wikileaks or directly to julian asange.  If that doesn't work, put it on freenet, a shadow internet designed specifically for suppression.  Clearly there are many options, and in this day and age, if one has a plan that works, they put it out there and the people will build it and the truth will prevail.  Chances are, the government raided those people's devices because they had made fraudulent, public market or health claims that were were sold prior to being evaluated by some government agency, to protect consumers, ie the fda,epa,etc.",1336176000,,1970,5.046296296296297

4899670,1,B005WL3QBW,"This professionally produced DVD is reminiscent of The Secret, another new age hit, in that it takes a few facts and contorts them into unrecognizable mush. It is common knowledge that, despite ample warnings by  Jefferson and the barriers put in place by the Founding Fathers, deregulation of banks together with the Citizen United have helped reinforce a dysfunctional political system that caters to the few at the expense of the many. One example is the Goldman Sachs bailout where the vampire squid trading outfit received 100 cents on the dollar through Hank Paulsen, the Treasure Secretary  who just happened to be a former Goldman executive. ""Wall Street psychopaths"", writes S. McCovney, ""generally lack empathy and interest in what other people feel or think""; they display an ""abundance of charm, charisma, [and] intelligence... but also possess an ""unparalleled capacity for lying, fabrication, and manipulation"". Everybody knows that finance and media are under control of a rather small group of intelligent and well educated people who are obviously (if usually unconsciously)  inclined to champion the interests of their own. It is clear that Big Pharma (Pfizer), Big Oil (Exxon) and Big Agriculture (Monsanto) are engaged in activities that directly hurt the consumer and that often include massive deception.  Why is Monsanto trying so hard to suppress people's right to know what is in their food? Why does Exxon channel tens of millions of dollars into climate pseudoscience? Is it really necessary for the taxpayer to subsidize the likes of Exxon, Halliburton and Monsanto at the time of when they're reaping obscene profits by manipulating the price of staples and oil?

However, to connect corporate malfeasance to Illuminati, UFOs and alien visitations, to the tired Rockefeller/Warburg cliches, the 0 point energy hoax, crop circles and off-the-rocker conspiracy theorists like David Ickes etc is at best deluded and at worst, exploiting and manipulative. In what looks like a guru schtick, Gamble is trying to whip up helpless paranoia amongst idjits who are congenitally predisposed to believe in conspiracy theories. For a Princeton graduate he seems to know little about science and less about economics. He has no clue about what Central Banks (such as the Fed) do; von Mieses, the libertarian hero quoted approvingly  in Thrive, is a fringe figure with pseudo-solutions that are not applicable to the XXIst century. Getting financial advice from the ""lizard-man"" Ickes is ... I mean, puhleaassse!  Movies like this compound the problem by misidentifying targets and misinterpreting reality.

As far as the big picture is concerned, the main issue is that we are controlled by our own ignorance and greed, not by the Illuminati. Goldman Sachs certainly is out there  ""doing God's work"" but ultimately it is the voter who has permitted Messrs Gramm (GOP), Rubin and Clinton (Democrats) to sell their souls (and open their pockets) to  the Goldmanites; Bush (Republicans) and Obama (Dem) who bailed them out while letting millions of regular folks get foreclosed upon, and the 99 percenters to mount the (first real) challenge to speculative greed and the insane quest for profit. Greed tends to exact its pound of flesh: nearly a quarter of male Wall Street brokers are clinically depressed, compared with 7 percent for the general male population. WaPo recently showed that  bankers are prone to ""insomnia, alcoholism, heart palpitations, eating disorders, and an explosive temper."" I wonder why. Anyway, read Mark Sundeen's inspiring book about Daniel Suelo for an antidote.

The best part of Thrive is the end - when he interviews the zen teacher whose intelligence and poise shine through the weirdness of it all. The one place where we need to liberate ourselves is the inner space of our bodies and minds, something that is close to ignored by the film.  I do not recommend this product that champions quackery and charlatanism while wearing the progressive mantle of ""freedom"". It preys on uneducated well-meaning folks who are trying to keep an open mind and an open heart. On people, who want to Thrive.  What if ""Thrive""  was produced by the Lizards in their unceasing effort to foster fear & paranoia and strengthen their lordship over the human race?

For nearly 2 decades I have sought out materials to help me find truth and understand the real reasons the world operates as we do. I always felt that what most people were seeing and being told was only the tip of the iceberg.  Mr Gamble shows us the rest.  I especially appreciate how the film explains important, complex issues in easy to understand language, explanations, illustrations.  The goal is truth telling and helping all to understand. The film scores an A Plus in that arena.

Thus far, this is the best analysis of what underlies our world's ongoing sufferings.  This gives substance, research, solidness to what heretofore was labeled by many only paranoid conspiracy theories. This film is about honest, heart felt research, fact finding and honest reporting.

I especially appreciate his methodical, truth seeking, altruistic approach. I could feel he and his wife's deep concern and intentions through the film. Within the accompanying website, one will quickly see many of the world's most respected experts in various fields who have contributed to this overall work.  This is not just one man's work and vision.  It will indeed be a group effort by all people to shift the direction of this planet.  This film, website and other tools are invaluable to that effort.

While each person will see the film through their own unique life's experiences and current belief systems... I can think of no better tool to help raise OUR planet's overall awareness, knowledge and willingness to contribute to remedies.

I sympathetically understand how this film may challenge some folks' vision of their world. I say... take what resonates with you today, leave the rest.  But most of all, be open, inquisitive and open minded. Continue to learn.

Never let anyone steal your right to ask deep, fair questions. And demand complete and honest answers. No one can take that unless you willingly give it away.

Thanks,

The movie even has all the claims right on their site -

""Full disclosure of the ET and UFO phenomena could dramatically transform the quality of life on this planet. It has the potential to alleviate poverty worldwide.""

I don't doubt there are possibly aliens somewhere in the world (it's a big world), but he takes that possibility and goes to extremes, and worse convinces people there is no global warming or risk of it. And the government (which is secretly ruled by several families who are keeping the alien inventions from our use) should pretty much be disbanded.

Among many negative effects, one is that if people they think global warming is a hoax, they will have no reason to do anything about it. Also, people will tend to not care for the very poor if they think the real problem is aliens not being allowed to give us energy machines. For those who are trying to help the poorest of the world in places like Haiti, this increases the efforts they have to make to get people to donate to nonprofits helping the poor.

[...]

The creator of the movie is super rich, and did lots of marketing to create hype about it, and taps into several appealing partial truths about the world, but cobbles those partial truths together with a good amount of hogwash. Much of the hogwash is presented persuasively so you'll be led to think it's true. After you spend hours researching it later, you find it's not true. They those in with some things anyone would agree so you think ""Good point"" then it's followed by an inaccurate point. Ultimately it's tapping the truths and mistruths to push a full-tilt libertarian political agenda. I would not mind a libertarian making a case for their cause based on truths and accuracy. I have good friend who's libertarian and we discuss it based on facts.

The movie is really aiming to pull new age people, conspiracy theorists, and some liberals into Proctor's agenda. I have some libertarian sympathies, and if I were a libertarian, I would distance myself from this movie and Proctor, regardless of any small gains their party makes from it, because once you realize the truth about it, it makes libertarianism look pretty bad.

I recommend avoiding the ""I'll check it out and see"" approach because you'll be contributing money to him. You'll also be bringing more attention and power to him because the higher viewership numbers are, the more others say ""Well if has those numbers, it's probably  good."" Lots of lame stuff (both left-wing and right-wing) has done well due to that phenomenon.

In addition, many studies show that once you get bad info in your brain, it's hard to get it out. Even when we hear correct info later on, our brains on average favor the incorrect info. It's been proven in several high quality studies. It's a like stain that either really hard to get out, or won't get out. The solution is to avoid the stain by avoiding info that is clearly inaccurate, and avoid sources you know are off track and going to stain your brain. Stick to truthful sources.

This is probably the most important 132 minutes you will ever spend. And you will feel compelled to share it with others when you are done watching it. However, I have spent more than 264 minutes watching it. The first time I watched it front to back by myself. The second time I watched it with a friend and we used the pause and rewind buttons a lot. You may want to do this too. There's a lot to take in. There are some scary things divulged in this documentary. Some I already knew, some I suspected, some that surprised me (and I'm not talking about one of those happy surprises). The conclusion that Foster Gamble and his wife make is the conclusion most would make once faced with the facts--this world is in big trouble. We are peering over the brink of a new world order (a centralized one-world government and monetary system - in the form of a passive and silent takeover by a group of mega rich families, including the Rockefellers, JPMorgans, Rothschilds, and a very few others). We came frightenly close to edging even closer to that brink when the US government came close to controlling the internet. Thanks to Google and other influential websites who made a stand and informed us of what was about to happen, we have not fallen over the edge of that brink yet.

People...we are very close and the ground is unstable. This video is a wake up call. And for the sake of our grandchildren and theirs, I hope this video becomes a best seller.

4899709,2,B005WL3QBW,"My wife had attended a public screening of the Thrive movie,  put on by a local holistic/ progressive group, and she later told me that I would probably love it. She borrowed a Thrive DVD, and we watched it at home.  I've read much about the Zero Point Field ('free energy'), crop circles, the influence of ET's in our ancient history, and about our economy, and so I did find the movie interesting.  But as the movie began to suggest the old conspiracy theory that the world is run by a handful of super-rich, evil puppeteers  intent on global domination, etc., etc.,  my antenna went up.  Where politically was this movie going?

My jaw dropped when the movie made the fallacious point that the sub-prime loan meltdown was orchestrated by this 'global elite' conspiracy. I have spent most of my life working in the mortgage business, and I've read many objective books about the meltdown, and it was clearly the de-regulation of the banking and Wall Street industry, combined with their unfettered and short-sighted greed, that caused the meltdown.  Why try to blame the Wall Street meltdown on anyone but the obvious culprits--the Wall Streeters and big banks--who were allowed to pursue their greedy capitalism by the politicians who receive millions from them for their campaigns.

As I continued to watch the movie I looked for the political punchline, the proposed solution to all of our problems. And then, about three quarters through the movie, it came: Foster Gamble said that he agreed with the views of libertarian Ludwig Von Mises. And I groaned audibly. I couldn't believe it. Somehow, after all of the film's apparently progressive, populist, and new- physics build-up, the so-called solution was the antiquated and largely dismissed views of the 'Austrian School', an absolutist libertarian philosophy from the '40's.

This is all about Libertarianism, the absolutist economic philosophy that is as far to the right-wing as Marxism is to the left-wing.  At first glance Libertarianism can seem appealing, because of its proposed exaltation of individual freedom. It says that our freedom is limited by laws, and laws are made by the government.  But this makes 'the government'  the enemy in their view, and un-regulated capitalism is our salvation. The extreme libertarian goal is to get rid of government and let private companies and corporations run everything. Think about it. They would lead us to toll roads and freeways, privately run prisons and law enforcement, private schools and colleges, and so on. Our government would supply our military, and that's about all.

This is the basic Republican stance (although Republicans are certainly not libertarians when it comes to social issues such as gay rights, women's rights, and about which drugs we can use). Ron Paul is very libertarian in his views, as is his son. Paul Ryan, the architect of the Republican budget which would dismantle Medicare, tear down Social Security, and lower taxes on the wealthy, gives Ayn Rand books to his staff.

The main problem with Libertarianism is that it is based on the almost religious doctrine that only the government is our problem. Governmental rules and regulations, taxes, the societal safety nets, the EPA and Department of Energy, are all the enemy. They would have us dismantle just about everything the government does to protect our air, water, food, and meds. Libertarians say that only the government can restrict your rights. So, get rid of it.

Some of our super-rich families such as the Koch brothers and the Waltons love Libertarianism.  If you want a conspiracy theory, you need to go no further than the Koch's, Walton's,  Big Wall Street companies, Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Big Health Insurers.  They want even lower taxes and even less regulation of their industries, so that they can amass even more power and wealth for themselves.  They don't care that the rest of us would lose whatever freedom and democracy we still have left.

And when I went to the thrivemovement website, there it all was. Along with quotes and pictures of Ron Paul and other libertarians were Gamble's narratives regarding points made in the movie. His 'Solutions' section is full of half-baked and superficial libertarian ideology. To make matters even worst, the website features many quotes from Stefan Molyneux of Freedomain Radio. Research this guy for yourself. He's an anarcho-capitalist who not only bashes government for all of our problems, but adds all religions, especially Judaism to his list. And he hates parents, too. Yes! He reaches out to all teenagers in his forums and podcasts and persuades them to leave their families and never look back. Parents, all parents, are abusive and controlling and the only solution is to leave them and break off all contact with them. Really unbelievable stuff, and many critics see his organization as a 'therapeutic cult'.

What's going on with Thrive, the thrivemovement website, and with Foster Gamble? Is this rich heir to the uber-wealthy Proctor and Gamble fortune just looking to indoctrinate the progressive/ spiritual/ community into extreme libertarianism in order to ensure his wealth and elite status? I really don't think so, although this argument could certainly be made. It is clear, though, that Thrive is a slick piece of propaganda. It sucks us in with its seamless graphics, topics, and interviews. And then when we've all become convinced that he's truly an open, honest man, just looking to transform the world, he finally brings in Von Mises. Very smooth and slick. In neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), this hypnotic device is called ""pacing and leading"".

This extreme Libertarianism would lead to a government with no power to counter the super-rich elite and their agenda.  Thrive's Libertarian propaganda is the total opposite of progressive.  It would take us back to the 1800's.  No child labor laws, no unions, 12 hour workdays, and few safety rules in the workplace.  Fans of Thrive have been duped.",1329696000,261,6001,5.0721544715447155

As everyone has said, the video is very well done. It's just weird as all get out. It's a mixture of Ancient Aliens, Alex Jones, Ron Paul, interlaced with dashes of Krishna and martial arts.

The Ancient Aliens, Krishna-feel the movie has is why I would give it one star. However, his solutions...I think are the right solutions, which is why I would give it five stars. I'm watching this thing, which is really long, and I start thinking this guy is starting to sound like Ron Paul. And then he admits he was heavily influenced by Von Mises. Well, that explains that. His solutions call for sound money and ending the Fed, shutting down the world bank and IMF, along with a host of libertarian, freedom supporting measures. Hey, I don't care if the guy thinks he is Buddha reincarnated, if his solutions happen to be the right solutions, then they are the right solutions.

His conspiracy stuff is over the top and then some, probably even for people that like Alex Jones.

Although devoid of any Biblical/spiritual awareness, Biblical scholars will recogzize a number of cues and clues that correspond very well with Biblical concepts.  Fortunately the brief, initial accounts of space aliens...while devoid of any apparent awareness of nephilim (Gen. ch. 6) or the 70th week of Daniel/aka tribulation period (Dan. ch. 9 and Rev. ch. 6-22)...quickly give way to a number of fascinating and quite legitimate and intriguing discoveries that make this video well worth the time and expense.

The producers of this video are obviously well intentioned and have included a wealth of thought provoking material.  Combining this video with two new DVD's, (1)Chuck Missler's, ""The Rapture"" and ""The Star of Bethlehem""  presented by Professor Rick Larson will provide a real tour-de-force regarding what the very near future of this world will entail.

Although the naive, conclusions of this video are a sharp contrast to the two thousand year old Biblical prophecies of Revelation and Daniel etc.; both perspectives end with an optimistic assessment of what lies before us.",1328832000,2,1209,5.438502673796791

4899724,1,B005WL3QBW,"Thrive is fundamentally flawed in its--for some, hypnotically--promoting a wide variety of conspiracy theories based on an illusory division between well-meaning but victimized majority of ""us"" and evil, greedy, powerful minority of 'them' while distracting and absolving from the troubling truth that the real source of the problem for global and local environmental/societal/financial ills is in all of US. If we truly look for solutions-- my choice is to study and practice permaculture--we need sanity, humility and diligence to change little by little the tiny worlds around us and make an effort to live sustainably while providing example and guidance for each other. Thrive is visual and ideological kitsch with unicorns and rainbows on our side and black-suited, menacing thugs in ski-masks on ""theirs""; appealing to open minds is the means of snake-oil peddlers and threateningly demanding for it is that of paranoids. Sure, give me a free energy generator, and I, with the rest of the free market, will embrace it--I think that it is hogwash along with the aliens. I would be much more in the company of the toned down but deep humanity of Stephen Hawking of TED than that of the directionless grand utopian vision--and global warming denial--of Foster (Procter &) Gamble of Thrive. I am sure that Mr. Gamble in his open-collar custom shirts considers the total vacuum of critical response to his movie and ""movement"" as the orchestrated suppression of his mission by the media controlled by ""thugs"" with white ties and pocket squares on the top of the corporate pyramids and not because they are patently infantile, not worthy of consideration.
BTW, I will not respond to ANY comment trying to promote/defend Thrive: watching was a waste of time and I had done my duty to warn--spending more time on it beyond committing my opinion to a text is unconscionable.

The overall message seems to be don't trust the government, large corporations, nor big banks.  I'm okay with that, but Gamble describes an oligarchy of evil and malevolent intent.  He's going in the right direction describing abuses of power and aggrandizement of the same.  Then he charges right off the cliff.  Funny how many Lemmings went with him giving the film five stars.

Still, this film is good for making me think.  I'm already libertarian in my politics, and this film points to many problems of big goverment and big business and their collusion which misallocates my taxes.  'Thrive' reminds me of the protester that I met at Occupy Austin.  He was angry about corporate greed affecting our government.  I found myself in agreement on the problem, just not the solution.

Thrivemovement.com has lots of good ideas that are not in the film.  While it is less complete than the meandering film, and pro-anarchy, the section on healthcare is the best thing I've seen.

4899744,5,B005WL3QBW,"A good friend sent me the YouTube link to this wonderful documentary a few months ago and my wife and I were able to watch the whole movie for free.  We were greatly impressed that a man of Foster Gamble's status and credibility came forward to present the facts of our enslavement so clearly and with so much honesty and conviction.

The YouTube link is no longer available for the complete movie and I'm not sure if this is because it was removed by those who are the power mongers or because Foster needs to raise money to proceed with this program of exposing that the ""king is naked"" and end this whole charade.

I am not usually inclined to invest much attention on the games of the world because - as long as humanity believes that reality is ""out there"" and things ""happen"" to them, apart from their own inner participation, then there is never going to be any real change in the way we relate to each other.  There will always be those who ""victimize"" and those who are ""victims"".  All of this ugliness and strife and conflict, etc. that is rampant in the world will just go on and there will always be those who are more intelligent and greedy and vicious and are able to continue to manipulate the rest of us who are just trying to be goodhearted, hard-working, helpful people.

No, as much as I really like this documentary that Forster Gamble and his lovely wife have developed - it will not have a lot of impact on changing the state of the 99% who are being used and abused; those who enjoy their power and their fortunes are willing to do whatever they have to in order to maintain their position at the top and they have unlimited resources in every department to ensure that they never will be taken down.  The armies of the world are all in their pocket and they own the means of production and now they are taking control of our food sources.

The only way things in the drama will ever change is when the majority of the oppressed 99% come into a new Awareness of our inherent Unity and Oneness as a race of beings with unlimited power to do good by everyone.  As long as we are still under the illusion that we are separate and powerless then the Oppressors will just play us all against each other and use our confusion, our petty selfishness and our belief in our littleness to keep us under their dominion.

I believe though that this powerful documentary will definitely begin this process of Awakening all of us to what is really happening and initiate the necessary Awakening of our inherent Unity and Power as a race.  We do not need to protest in the streets, nor do we need to take up arms and spill blood in the streets.  All of this is just playing into the hands of those who will use these kinds of ineffective challenges to their control to tighten their control even more.  No, in the end it will require that the vast majority of humanity will need to just WAKE UP and shrug of these chains as any full grown adult elephant can shake off their tiny baby strength leg irons.  But, elephants have been carefully conditioned from birth to wear their chains and they come to believe they can't escape.  And so have the vast majority of humans.  We cannot be chained, not in fact, not as a majority acting as one, but we have been conditioned to believe that we are separate and isolated from each other from our birth, and so we remain caught in our belief in our weakness, and we remain docile and manipulated.

How can this universal AWAKENING happen?  Just SHRUG.  All together we just need to SHRUG.  There is nothing stopping us from doing this, not in fact.  The chains of the Oppressors will fall off as if they were gossamer threads - how could they stop billions of us if we just say NO and then proceed to live as free beings?  And then, from an Awareness of a universal consciousness that each of us can tap into, participate in, and be guided by - we can begin to work as One to make a world that is a reflection of our true nature as a race of loving, kind and benevolent beings. This potential is in our DNA and it is the birthright of each and all and it will manifest all in a perfect way and in a perfect time and order, without strife, without violence and without bloodshed.  Just SHRUG.",1326326400,6,4240,4.352791878172589

WHAT WE CAN DO TO EMPOWER OURSELVES.
I think people have forgotten that we all make a difference, and that what happens to one of us happens to ALL of us.
I believe the message we need to get is that we need to love more, stay connected, and educate ourselves to make good positive choices, both individually and collectively.

4899755,5,B005WL3QBW,"As a researcher of global markets (banking, money supply), our food supply, toxins in our environment of which most of us are essentially are unaware and ignorant, global scaling (explains why structures and processes of nature are fractal and the causes of logarithmic scale-invariance), the power of the mind and the power of human potential as it relates to much of the above, this film is a MUST SEE if you are interested in how things REALLY work in our world. Not in order of the movie, Gamble does an incredible job explaining the truth about how our financial markets and banking industries work in a cyclical fashion and how a very small population of the very, very wealthy actually can and do manipulate these cycles to gain more wealth and control over time. He further explains that this is done with the distinct knowledge that most of the larger population (you and me)not only misunderstands these cycles and principals but that we are also always the pawns that are played. The movie also does a very good job (albeit minimally due to length of film and content) uncovers how our food is controlled without our knowledge and/or interest.

The movie briefly discusses Monsanto and their control of seed around the world through international patents and GMO control (another great film is ""The World According to Monsanto""). The control of seed via genetic modification and international patents is very, very dangerous. Further, it explains the fact that many of our foods contain hormone disrupting chemicals/toxins. The science shows unequivocally that certain pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are the predominant reason for increases in breast and prostate cancers, increases in infertility rates among the younger population, especially males, and for the increases seen in pediatricians offices of the demasculinization (smaller genitals) of our little boys ([...] All of which can be researched - we should take heed. My opinion is that we are indeed all pawns in these markets of power.

The film discusses the vast amounts of energy power that has always been available to us, explaining what free energy is and how it is naturally occurring around us all the time (I must say, Gamble makes a fairly interesting albeit weak argument for how we could have possibly obtained this information - loved the part on the crop fields though - simply breathtaking). Gamble goes on to explain the conspiracy that many of our brightest physicists in the field of free energy were either murdered or silenced in order to contain this information and how this was done by (possibly) large corporations and wealthy entities. Sounds quite plausible. It is not hard to imagine why this would be done. Can you imagine a world without Exxon, Mobile, or any of the other oil companies? They will not go down without a fight. Gamble explains governments know of this form of energy that could answer all of our energy problems but they are themselves controlled by the wealthy (owners of banks, the Federal Reserve and the World Banks), who control the large corporations (oil and food companies. Maybe he should know. Proctor and Gamble?

He also describes the medical industry and its control over information. My husband is a physician and there is no doubt medical doctors are controlled in how they think, how they treat disease processes and how they are seen in their own circles should they venture out of those circles. Thankfully there are more and more doctors willing to become independent thinkers opening the doors to question their oath ""First Do No Harm""? Many of them, including my husband, are saying there must be more. How about starting at a place of doing some good rather than a place of first doing no harm? The first is a ""going towards"" statement, latter is a ""going away"" from statement.

If you're desiring a wake up call for your life and your world, watch ""Thrive"". If you don't care, go pour another round of cool aid.

I find this quote by the Buddha to be very relevant-
""..Do not believe in anything on the authority of your teachers.
Do not believe in traditions just because they have been handed down.

But after observation and analysis,
when you find that anything agrees with reason
and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all,
then accept it and live up to it.""

This documentary will conflict with many things we believe to be true and have never questioned. I advice that one watches this documentary with an open mind and do question what it states. Look up the facts, do your research! Come to your own conclusions. I have, and I have found that we have been living in a world were lies prevail.

I won't go into much detail about the contents of the movie other than to say, ""See it."" I can't explain it well enough to make it sound nearly as compelling as it is.

Thereafter I found myself also wanting to understand more about the following topics:
  - ""Fractional Reserve Lending"" (well explained in the cartoon ""How MONEY & BANKING Really works"" on Youtube)
  - ""Vacuum Energy"" a.k.a. ""Free Energy"" (well explained here by one of the commentators in Thrive:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Whole/dp/B004CYVZ18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Whole</a>)

Now Im not given it 3 stars because it asks me to believe in aliens and tells me we live in an undercover oppressive world system, but because it spends so much time going through a depressing picture of human existence of todays world and does a quick wrap up of the last 20 minutes of saying "" there are some organic farms and feed the hungry organizations, so its not all bad!"". the weight of the problem calls for  humanity to become organized and respond together and strategically. I would even say, that we need to push forward our human evolution by helping each other out more and moving away from a existence based on money. basically, the world is messed up and theres no real solutions from this movie! But I do think exposing the problems will have people talking and eventually coming together. the world is being controlled by big banks the same way middle eastern countries are controlled by leaders. but 2011 was the year of revolutions as people woke up from their brain washing oppressive systems and stood against their leaders for human rights and freedoms. eventually americans will realize we are not free, we are under a system and we will stand up too. and just by the nature of the world, we americans still do have a stronger voice than third world countries. when we break the systems, they will be gone for good. as for solving world hunger and all human suffering ...... thats the goal of any good hearted person but thats not a realistic world to hope for. just work out ur karma so you don't have to come back here next life time, thats what my mama said!!",1325030400,13,1764,4.444444444444445

4899767,4,B005WL3QBW,"Some of the information revealed in this documentary is truly shocking! That being said I have no doubt that the"" facts"" presented can be verified, however, the conclusions they draw I think can be debated. The us verses them theory of a powerful cabal controlling the financial, political, medical, and educational systems of our world leading to a one world order of total control is easy to buy into. There are other ways of looking at what is happening. I happen to believe in the oneness of all things, that everything is connected and originates from the one source. I believe that collectively we are creating our reality which means wether we like something or hate something we are the creators of it and therefore can change what we want to change. The major factor in this theory is conscious awareness of what we are creating. If we are unconscious or in denial of what we are collectively creating we could feel helpless and perceive ourselves to be victims by others who are doing  terrible things to us. On that point alone I find this film to be an eyeopener for all of us to really look at what ""we"" have created, tolerated, unknowingly supported and willingly embraced. From a psychological point of view, having worked in the drug addiction field for a number of years, denial is a major obstacle to recovery because if you don't ""see"" or acknowledge the destructiveness of your behavior, there is no insight to know how to change it. For that reason I think ""Thrive"" is very helpful to show ""us"" what we have created and offer some constructive alternative actions to take to create a  more harmonious world. The film is very thoughtfully put together using helpful graphics and powerful pictures to make their points. The dozens of interviews by expert scientist and other promenent people lend credibility to this film and really make you ponder the information revealed  long after viewing the documentary. The length of the film is a bit too long for one sitting. I think it is best to break it up into two sittings. I commend the makers of this film for their courage to present to society the dark side of our creations and help all of us to look into the mirror and see where we could do things differently.",1324339200,9,2234,4.66497461928934

It does not matter whether you vote for a Democrat or Republican for president.  They are both controlled by the powerful corporations. Those who get in the way are removed.

The ""accredited"" medical schools are only allowed to teach what the elite powers permit. If someone finds a cure for disease or builds a vehicle that runs without fossil fuel, it should not matter if they got their degree from a Cracker Jack box.

4899775,5,B005WL3QBW,"Foster Gamble and his wife have done a wonderful job of connecting the dots as to why the human race doesn't thrive. Bringing to the screen the different aspects of our very existence that rely on the ""benevolence"" of our self appointed masters that control almost every aspect of the environmental influences that create each of us as individuals. When you realize that who you are is the product of manipulation by a self appointed elite, you begin searching for ways out of the Matrix. I found myself searching 25 years ago when I took the red pill. I realized that all that I had been ""taught"" in school was a fabrication, (euphemism for lie) and that the concept of country, state and governments were all similar to the Wizard Of Oz, fictions created by small men with big heads behind screens. Foster puts the puzzle together in such a way that even the individual with average intelligence can understand why we are in the ""mess"" we are in as a species. Why we don't thrive. Why we don't prosper. And the answer isn't religion. It isn't war. It isn't voting. It isn't having a bigger house or a faster car. It isn't about the ""things"" we are told we need to buy to impress people we don't even like. It is understanding a core principle. The principle of non violation. That core principle is the very essence that peace is based on. When you are not VIOLATED you don't feel that you have to protect yourself. You don't feel enslaved. You don't feel like you are doing something wrong by trying to keep what is rightfully yours.  When you get to keep the fruits of YOUR labor and not have it stolen from you by deceit and deception as well as gun point in the form of ""taxes"" or inflation, you feel good about yourself which in turn translates to feeling good about others. (The golden rule being love thy neighbor as thyself, having love for yourself is the missing ingredient.) I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it over a period of three days FOUR times. Once with my youngest son and three times by myself to see what I might have missed the first time. And just because you happen to not ""believe"" in part of it, don't throw out the rest. The section on extra terrestrial life may be hard to swallow for some, but it doesn't mean that it isn't true. So just put the parts you don't ""agree"" with on the shelf somewhere and as you grow in your understanding of a world view, that let's you understand that ALL mankind can thrive within, you will find yourself going back to that shelf to add some more understanding to the whole that is being created within you.

An eye opener with chilling implications. It shows the Global Domination plan in detail (*they're on the last step*). It clearly explains why we don't have cures for Cancer, Aids and other life-threatening diseases. This plan is also why we are always at war and why each of us are in debt.

I now understand why the Government doesn't listen to us. They're getting thier marching orders from someone else and these ""someone else's"" don't think of us as human beings, to them we are cattle or insignificant robots- Slaves.

As the movie lays out the entire plan you'll recognize it explains why the world is the way it is today. Then the movie explains the solution or counter-action plan step-by-step which is what I like most.

If humanity wants to survive and move into a future where positivity and compassion is the every day norm for moving forward in our existence, then we need AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE to see this movie and join the effort. Buy the movie and hold a screening for free. This movie is top quality and directs the viewer to a website where each fact can be studied individually.

The movie does scare a person some, but has an up-beat ending projecting hope. Stars Deepak Chopra and Barbara Marx Hubbard among others.

In short, this IS what the 99% and the rest of us are so upset about. We just couldn't put a title to it, or our finger on exactly what was happening, or who was to blame (it is not the Governments or Corp. of the world).

May God unite us in our final stand.",1323302400,9,1646,4.451827242524917
4899779,5,B005WL3QBW,"A couple of reviewers seem hell-bent on trashing this video, so I want to straighten a couple of things out in what they tell you.

1 ""These people are not real scientists"". Well, a small amount of research into the people who bring forth great inventions into this world will quickly show that often they are outside of the mainstream. Two quick examples: The Wright brothers were bicycle repairmen but that did not prevent them inventing the first aircraft. And Albert Einstein did not let the fact that he did badly at school and was working as a lowly patent clerk stop him from inventing the theory of relativity that also impacted the entire world.

2 Whenever a radical insight arises the mass of humanity are slow to believe it - and the establishment do their best to destroy it. We only have to look at Galileo who had the audacity to suggest the Earth went around the Sun and was threatened with death if he did not retract his theories, to see the fallacy that the established views of how this world and universe work could be deeply flawed. Nowadays he is venerated as the ""father of modern science"".

But of course those who are critical of Thrive would have immediately seen the truth of Galileo, Einstein, the Wright brothers, et al. Wouldn't they...? Or would they have used ridicule, slander, the views of established ""experts"", and outright threats to control those who threatened their view of the world?

I already knew most of the facts which I have learned from many different sources (verifyable on their site[...]) but didn't have the full understanding of the WHY'S. Now I understand the whole plan for the New World Order, the dots are all connected, and the dirty little plan for a few of the 'elite' to feed their lust for power and to control the entire World population is very clear. I think the Gambles/directors are 100% correct. We are all being conquered and most of us don't even know it. It's a great wake-up movie made in as positive a light as possible.

Hard to believe but some of my friends still believe the US is some sort of innocent victim and that the war on terror is real.

Weaving into the UFO story might sounds a little crack pot-ish but if you are fans of these independent movies like ""Food inc,"" fork over knives"" many titles by Michael Moore, or ""inside job"" This movie is very ambitious and trying to weave all these theory plus more and make it into a total package. But the first question you have to ask is""do you want to take the red pill or the blue pill?"" How far are you going to let yourself into this rabbit hole.",1321833600,11,912,4.5
4899788,5,B005WL3QBW,"Many people feel uncomfortable about aspects in our society, but do not know exactly why. This films explains why their sense of discomfort is right and well founded. This film is important, because it summarizes in a succinct and understandable way the facts of what is going on completely unreported in our society. People need to know what is going on, so they can focus, commit and act for change.
A GREAT film with superb graphics (love the crop circles!!!), clear messages and great insights and connections. All you need is an open mind and open eyes and open ears. The truth in this film may be a bitter pill, but it sets you free and is very well made and presented. I know form personal experience that a lot of this is absolutely so. I will give this DVD to all my friends as I feel our future is at stake unless we know, wake up and act. 99% only count if 99% stand up to be counted.

4899789,5,B005WL3QBW,"This film is eye-opening for those who've been asleep - I've done pretty much the same sort of research as the filmmakers and come to pretty much the same conclusions, so I was already familiar with most of what is presented and found it to be intelligently packaged for a more general audience. This film puts together information about things that have been hidden from humanity, such as free energy/physics, natural healing methods, and the way a small elite culture has set up a system to control and manipulate the rest of humanity. The way this is destructive to the planet and human health and well-being is discussed, and solutions to empower and liberate humanity are presented toward the end. People like Deepak Chopra, David Icke, Steven Greer, Edgar Mitchell, Nasseim Harremin, John Perkins, Catherine Fitts, and other whistleblowers are included in this film, whose creator is an heir of the Gamble family (of Proctor & Gamble). This movie is well organized and coherent, presenting solid research and wise guidance about creating solutions to the identified challenges facing humanity. Even if you don't agree with all the solutions you will find a lot to ponder, and the facts of history that are presented are hard to refute in any rational way. Definitely watch this and share it with those around you. Be awake and aware!",1321747200,41,1339,4.955555555555556
4899790,5,B005WL3QBW,"MUST, MUST SEE! This film is a considered, thoroughly researched, even-handed look at the state of the world in all of it shame and glory. With careful, methodical steps, Gamble identifies the existence of an energetic ""code"" that moves through, within, and around our bodies, galaxies--indeed, all of existence. Shifting to the crises of modernity, he traces all of our primary social systems to their roots, as he says, he ""followed the money"" and discovered what is already well known but rarely tracked so well: that there are an elite few groups controlling the masses through the economy, politics, healthcare, education, food supply, media, and so forth. He also came to some surprising conclusions about a manipulative global agenda that his research has proven to be more true than not. And just when you're about to throw in the towel and say uncle to the seemingly overwhelming forces pulling us like puppets on a string, Gamble elegantly brings in the plethora of solutions--the restabilizing elements being created and lived by awakening human beings, and the positive people, events, and innovations that are in tandem with a sustainable and evolutionary path for humanity. We come full circle to the code as a model for how this guides us energetically, morally, and in daily life.

The film concludes with specific suggestions, visions, and applications that we can do now and with an eye toward the future, all of which are comprehensively and interactively presented in the Thrive website. Most importantly, the message of this film is one of empowering ourselves with understanding of the systems currently in place, both socially and cosmically, so that we can make informed, non-violating choices for new systems emerging that will support a sustainable world that we have the power to create. And this film inspires us to do so. Simply brilliant--and a gift to all humankind.",1321747200,14,1897,5.119354838709677

4899793,5,B005WL3QBW,"This is one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. Are you wondering what happened to our economy? Why there is so much going wrong? Thrive presents a very coherent understanding of how the system is rigged for the benefit of a few and perpetuates injustice throughout the world.

Even if you don't agree with all the particulars about the nature of that injustice it's important to have an understanding of what's wrong with the system today, why it's that way and what we can do to fix it. We need to wake up!

This isn't about Democrat or Republican, Liberal or Conservative, those are red herrings and just keep us fighting amongst ourselves instead of making things better.

Watch it, and watch it until the end because it does have an empowering ending. Together we can make a difference. I would give this 10 stars if I could. HIGHLY Recommended!",1321660800,175,866,4.6103896103896105
4899794,5,B005WL3QBW,"I watched the You Tube version of this movie twice. Even though the viewing was free, I've decided to purchase the DVD to support this movement. There are so many answers to so many burning questions...why does the US government continue to make decisions against the best interests of her citizens? Why do corporations seem to have so much influence in our government? Why are natural cures suppressed? What about the UFO phenomenon? (I, personally have two sightings, I KNOW they are real). What about zero point energy? Answers to these, and MANY more questions are clearly laid out. This is not just a movie, this is quite possibly the spark that will awaken mankind and free us of the bonds that have been placed upon us. Watch the free version, buy the DVD. Share this message of truth. The Mayans may have very well been right....the end of the Mayan calendar may just trigger a human awakening that will change mankind forever. The slave masters will deride, or will send their minions to deride this movement, these truths. Don't let them win. Wake up, mankind, it CAN and WILL get better.",1321660800,13,1098,4.723958333333333

Besides that, they actually make a logical attempt at trying to solve some of the great challenges mankind faces. Most books I've read about these topics just point to the doom and gloom without providing logical solutions, so they leave you feeling depressed.

Also, to add, the info in the film is all taken from research, and fact checked by independent professional checker during production. I, too, have found almost all of this info in my own research over the years. If you find something too hard to believe, and Foster's breakdown doesn't quite convince you, ALWAYS look it up for yourself.
