But when he's in the shop and on the road it's great. Loved to listen to Kid Rock perform ""long haired country boy"". I am realy into his skills and his bikes. This film does it for me.

2245608,3,B0007V6IVC,"Great opening, some of the best camera work i have seen of any of the Motorcycle mania dvds.  I feel way too much time is spent on Jesses dramas with wives, ex wives, and girlfriends, its interesting to know what hes upto in his personal life but the camera spends too much time covering this side of his life, lets bring on the bikes, cars, and metal work, areas where he excels.",1178582400,,380,4.277777777777778
2245609,5,B0007V6IVC,"Excellent production, great content.  Shot with HD cameras, looks great on a SD television.  Highly recommended.",1156723200,,112,5.9375
2245610,5,B0007V6IVC,"I enjoyed the candid approach.  I frequent Old Mexico(Sonora)

where the journey ended.  The mix of Old Mexico, Harleys and genuin people was sorrel. Jessy and Kid were also cool.",1156118400,,179,4.9
2245611,5,B0007V6IVC,"If your a fan of Jesse James and motorcycles, then this movie is for you.. I really enjoyed it.",1155081600,,95,4.052631578947368
2245612,5,B0007V6IVC,"Another awesome job by The Discovery Channel!  In this documentary they follow Jesse James has he customizes new choppers for himself and Kid Rock to ride down into Mexico and just get lost.  All the while Jesse talks about the challenges in his daily life as the cameras follow him down the isle and to divorce, btw his x-wife is one of the hottest women ever! He also joins Kid Rock on a trip to Afghanastan to boost morale for the Troops. So you have Jesse James, Kid Rock, American Troops, Hot Rods and Custom Choppers...you can't go wrong!",1139443200,2,544,4.484848484848484
2245613,5,B0007V6IVC,the dvd is great but the delivery takes too long otherwise very impressed with service and item.,1125014400,2,96,4.705882352941177
2245614,3,B0007V6IVC,"This is another great show of Jesse James talents, his bikes in my opinon stand apart from the hundreds of custom bike builders out there. He also has a way of looking really cool when he rides. I think for these reasons the Motorcyle Mania series has been so popular. My problem with this show was seeing too much of Jesse's soon to be ex-wife. I would have liked to see more of Jesse's other hobbies, like his collection of cool cars, and more back ground on the differant types of racing he does. Also

I think other bike builders would have liked to see more of the inner workings of West Coast Choppers. I just hope if there is a MM 4 we don't have hear about another future ex-wife unless she knows how to build a killer chopper.",1114387200,6,735,4.25

8052187,4,B0007V6IVC,"Of all biker build offs, monster garage, OCC, etc. this episode was my favorite. Disappointed that it's as expensive as it is but that's supply and demand I suppose.",1456704000,,165,4.724137931034483
8052188,4,B0007V6IVC,I saw this episode previously on A and E but wanted to own it.  I agree with one of the other reviews in that the dvd focuses too much on Jesses' soon to be ex-wife and not enough on bike building. I primarily enjoyed the riding through Mexico.  All in all quite enjoyable.,1438992000,,273,4.132075471698113

8052192,4,B0007V6IVC,before he became pretentious and too focused on being different.  2003-6 was Jesse James time to shine and man this video totally show it.,1395273600,,138,4.75
8052193,4,B0007V6IVC,"Really enjoyed this documentary, this film shows a side to Jesse James that I think many people never see. This isn't just about motorcyles, it's a about a life's work and journey",1358985600,,179,4.625
