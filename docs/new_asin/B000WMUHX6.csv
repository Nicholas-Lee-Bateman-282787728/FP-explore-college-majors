2987680,2,B000WMUHX6,"The English-speaking teacher sucks big time.  She obviously didn't work out her full routine before starting the video.  She has many stops and starts where the class (obviously professional dancers) couldn't follow her.  The songs have long repetitions of the same movement.  I will take this video when I travel because I can do the steps in a small amount of space, but I am disappointed in the level of instruction.  I get much better instruction in my local class.",1331337600,,469,4.8125

It does not feel like you are doing much, yet at the end of each session your heartrate is up. After doing the arm routines the blood rushes to your hands a bit, the feeling I have only felt before when running a weed eater for a good amount of time. They did not go too fast for me, but I cannot do the hip movements to save my life, maybe with more practice. Cannot get worse right?",1329523200,,511,4.019607843137255

I find i get bored with the choreography and scenery.  So it is a three star for me.  It is fast and i do get a workout but, just not exciting.

2987687,3,B000WMUHX6,The workout is ok. I do enjoy other Zumba dvds and the Wii game better though. Some of the moves transition too quick for me. I would suggest if you can't keep up to just try your best and keep moving. It is a cardio workout and probably burns 500 to 700 calories because its moderate to hard in pace.,1312502400,4,301,4.033333333333333

8224322,2,B000WMUHX6,"Zumba Rapido seems like more like a rehearsal for the video but somehow was published as the real thing. There's no real instruction of the steps, as they move rapidly from one move to the next so prepare to spend a lot of time watching & trying to fall in line. I'm sure I would've burned more calories had they instructed better & watching the Beginner's DVD is fine but it's natural to forget when you move on to the other workouts. At one point, both instructors are trying to figure out if the music playing is Salsa or something else as they fumble through the steps. The laughter among them, the screw-ups as they go along & the random couple dance breaks make this workout more of an outtake than a calorie burning fun cardio session it was meant to be.",1365465600,,761,4.366197183098592
8224323,5,B000WMUHX6,"I couldn't find a good Zumba dvd anywhere.  I luv it!  It is not too hard and after you do it a couple times it is easier.  They do talk alot in Spanish, which is a little annoying, if you don't speak Spanish, like me, but you can tell what they are doing. One girl talks English but she doesnt keep up as well with the translation as she should. It is about 30 min. long and also has a kids zumba workout on it, that is fun as well.  very energizing.  nothing like Zumba",1355184000,,471,3.9157894736842107
8224324,4,B000WMUHX6,"Not many women my age (62)will actually make the purchase of this dvd, but I basically like it.  If I were to make the featured dancers have a good laugh, I would take a video of me attempting to follow their moves!  They would see how uncoordinated most people really are (and I spent years as a dancer and karate student).  I would like to see the backs of the people doing the dance moves so I could figure out which foot and arm is doing what!  Often they assume you already know the basic moves, then they add the arms and go in different directions.  More disturbing and disconcerting is the kids version where 6-8 year olds totally have the dances down pat.  Attempting to follow the kids is doubly impossible!!!",1350604800,,719,4.409090909090909
8224325,4,B000WMUHX6,"The DVD arrived earlier than anticipated :-) The ease of purchase was nice and easy. The DVD is good for beginners and those that want a fun instructional DVD. Good break time inbetween dances or you have the option to fast forward to the next. So it is nice if you only have 10 minutes or 30 minutes...depending on your day. It is dissapointing that the music hardly comes through, but once you get into the DVD it's not really a big deal. Overall, good buy and would buy from this seller again.",1339891200,,496,4.344086021505376
8224326,2,B000WMUHX6,"I bought this feeling it would be easy to follow...not the case at all. It's spoken in Spanish & English, but mostly Spanish. You will need to know the dance moves prior to trying to video.",1332115200,2,189,4.277777777777778
