8252887,5,B0013TQTDY,A fun video to watch!  I love watching the Lindner brothers - especially Al - go all crazy bananas catching some lunker lake trout.  Very educational too.  They cover everything from summer trolling to winter ice fishing for lakers and everything in between.,1464739200,,258,4.953488372093023
8252888,4,B0013TQTDY,"A bit dated, but a good overview of lake trout fishing with lots of practical tips.  Watched this before heading up to the Finger Lakes last year and was glad I did.  Looking forward to trying more of the tips in Ontario this year!",1395446400,,231,4.2272727272727275
8252889,5,B0013TQTDY,"I've been fishing the lake trout for decades but I still had plenty to learn about new methods to catch him. I'm going to set up wire line trolling rigs just like they show in the video. I also picked up a lot of good advise on jigging technique. If this video has a flaw it is that it does not delve into some of the classic bait and trolling technigues. Great value none the less. Now, if In Fisherman would do a brook trout video I'd be a happy man!",1243036800,,452,3.978021978021978
