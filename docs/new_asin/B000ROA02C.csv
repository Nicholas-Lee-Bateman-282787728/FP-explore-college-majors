2871636,4,B000ROA02C,"The production is not as engaging as any of Attenbourough's, but I have found the series appropriate to introduce Africa to my young children.  There are no mating scenes.  Some of the cinematography is quite beautiful.",1361836800,2,219,5.055555555555555
2871637,2,B000ROA02C,"Good film work, bad informational, not a film for naturalists other than the cinematography, ridiculous music, just ridiculous and over the top, I put it on mute several times just to enjoy the scenery.",1360972800,,202,4.970588235294118
2871638,5,B000ROA02C,This is one of the well regarded BBC productions about our worlds natural areas. It is wonderful to watch and holds the attention of my children very well.,1360195200,,155,4.571428571428571
2871639,3,B000ROA02C,"In just about every segment, the commentary includes the phrase ""million(s) of years."" Probably 20 times in the first episode. Really. Why do we need to hear the theory presented as fact throughout the episode like this. Even if you do believe in evolution, it would have to be annoying. I've seen gobs of nature shows and have never had it this bad. Other than that, the show was great.",1352592000,3,387,4.542857142857143
2871640,5,B000ROA02C,"I really enjoyed Wild Africa - six episodes describing various parts of Africa; mountains, coasts, deserts, etc... .  Very beautiful documentary and superb narrator.  I want to see if there are any more done by the same group.  I believe this was shown through the BBC.",1340236800,,269,4.804347826086956
2871641,5,B000ROA02C,"Each episode covers a different ecosystem on the African continent. The episodes discuss the environmental changes that have given rise to each species. I prefer looking at individual ecosystems on one continent rather than the ""flying around the world"" approach of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>. With that said, this documentary is much older than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;(first produced in the late 1980s), so it simply doesn't have the HD quality viewers are used to. Regardless, there are still some amazing scenes, such as sea lions sneaking up on gannets in the water and hippos fighting each other with bloody jaws. Also, the enhanced mode is actually informative and not too intrusive, mentioning interesting facts about the animals. Definitely worth checking out.",1249344000,8,1015,7.327868852459017
2871642,5,B000ROA02C,"This is a great widescreen (16 x 9) production, with good quality and exceptional wildlife sequences.  I have seen no better recent surveys of the natural landscape of Africa, and the group of 6 programs plus extra features is an outstanding value.  Think of a Planet Earth that focuses on the continent of Africa.",1233619200,8,314,4.796296296296297
2871643,5,B000ROA02C,"Excellent presentation of some awesome wildlife and African scenery.  It comes in two discs.  Highly recommended for wildlife lovers or those who have been to Africa or who want to go to Africa (I have, and it is well worth going) or those who have not given it a thought.  This will get you wanting to go.",1197504000,10,306,4.333333333333333

2871677,4,B000ROA02C,"One of the better documentaries on Africa I've seen. Nice shot choices and manipulations, good commentary.  This is so much better than grannies on safari. It showcases the country and its wildlife and vegetation. A cheap alternative to an actual foray to the country.",1408320000,,268,5.090909090909091

2871695,4,B000ROA02C,"I really enjoyed this series. My only reason for not giving 5 stars ,is that sometimes you could not hear the narrator cause the music played right over his voice.  However, the pictures are worth a thousand words.",1404345600,,214,4.631578947368421
2871696,5,B000ROA02C,Breathtaking photography and insightful discourse on the wonders of Africa.  I enjoyed every minute.  The story telling integrated with the amazing cinematography made it outstanding.,1404259200,,183,6.28
2871697,5,B000ROA02C,"I've read a little about the people of Africa and years ago had a few friends from Ghana but never really paid too much attention to the geography.  It is so diverse, I had no idea and the wild life of each area and the means they have taken over the years to adapt is simply remarkable.  I definitely would recommend the whole series t anyone with just a little interest, you won't be disappointed.",1403913600,,399,4.306666666666667

Informative, beautiful, very good narrative, astounding photography got my attention & kept it. Oh yeah, children friendly, too. Will there be more available?  By the way, I did do the dishes...later. :-D",1402444800,2,311,4.980769230769231
2871700,5,B000ROA02C,"I hate reality tv.  90% of programming now is complete trash.  I don't stumble upon many real, old-school documentaries on tv anymore.  I'm glad I stumbled upon this one.  It's free to watch with my Amazon Prime membership, so all the better!  Wild China on BBC is even better!",1402012800,,277,4.571428571428571
2871701,5,B000ROA02C,"For anyone who enjoys Nature and the way God's Creations in the wild are shown which Is very well this is a great series.
I learned a lot, the scenery is breathtaking and the survival instincts of the animals is impressive.
As far as I am concerned it is a must watch",1401926400,,267,4.153846153846154
2871702,5,B000ROA02C,Great expansiveness in this natural science film.  Enjoy it and learning from it.  Africa is larger than my previous understanding.,1401667200,,131,5.5
2871703,5,B000ROA02C,Fantastic program.  Really enjoyed it.  Watch it over and over again.  Good to have on for background too.  Very informative.,1400976000,,125,5.1

2871725,4,B000ROA02C,Sorry but I have not seen this. you must of got me mixed up with someone else. I love animal documentaries so I bet it is a good one,1398470400,,132,3.586206896551724
2871726,4,B000ROA02C,The background naration is very pleasent and the video is entertaining and well presented. I keep looking for videos in this genre which are as well produced. The only better I have found are David Attenborough's - Africa.,1398384000,,222,4.868421052631579
2871727,5,B000ROA02C,"Excellent. I was in Africa for my Honeymoon more than a decade ago, and it was an awe-inspiring experience. Wild Africa is just beautiful and brought back so many memories.

Beautiful and captivating. I felt so present while watching this. It is quite a delightful education. At the end, you are left wanting more.",1397952000,,174,5.0344827586206895
2871730,5,B000ROA02C,"When you get fed up with all the sitcoms and are wanting something to expand your brain rather than dull it, this is one of the shows you should watch in my opinion. Not only is it nature, but it's educational and everyone in your home can watch it. Parents can sit with their kids and learn as well as talk about the things they are seeing.. it's interaction with each other.. you remember that right? lol.. anyway.. I highly recommend this show whether you are watching it alone or with the family. You can escape to Africa and come away with a bit more knowledge and perhaps a higher level of appreciation for this world and it's wildlife.",1397779200,,642,4.4033613445378155
2871731,5,B000ROA02C,"Fantastic close-up shots of the wildlife. Narrative was well done but was from the standpoint of evolution, citing millions of years in formation of mountains, etc. The biblical account of creation is much more believable.",1397606400,,222,5.371428571428571
2871732,4,B000ROA02C,Pretty interesting...a little slow at times but filled with a lot of cool info. The kids hung with it and seemed to enjoy it!,1395273600,,125,4.25
2871733,5,B000ROA02C,The photography is breath taking and the narrative is great!  I like the way the geology and ecology of the different environments is incorporated into the featured animal species.,1394582400,,180,5.206896551724138
2871744,5,B000ROA02C,Love this for my class and my own kids.  Such beautiful images! Fascinating how much there is to know still about our planet.,1394409600,,125,4.434782608695652
2871745,1,B000ROA02C,The filmography was fantastic but the way they shove the THEORY of evolution down the throat of the viewer nearly in every sentence took away from our enjoyment.,1393804800,2,161,4.785714285714286
2871746,5,B000ROA02C,The documentary is well out together.  It kept me entertain and I'm the type who doest watch television but when I do I choose documentaries. Also happy Presidents' Day.,1392595200,,169,4.827586206896552

2871750,5,B000ROA02C,Both my wife and I were enchanted by the various segments of this series. Mostly one thinks of the migration of animals in Africa. This series showed there is so much more.,1388448000,,172,4.40625
2871751,5,B000ROA02C,"Another good production of many of the animals of Africa, showing their means of survival (which might be a bit more than smaller kids should see).  Showing the various areas and species of animals is entertaining and educational and is interesting to see some unexpected levels of intelligence.",1387238400,,295,5.145833333333333
2871752,4,B000ROA02C,beautiful cinematography mske this film worth seeing.  never before seen place and animal behavior are what make it stand out.,1387152000,,126,5.3

2871774,5,B000ROA02C,"One of the very best parts of amazon prime is the video. While I really wish that there were more available to watch for free with my subscription, some of the available things are amazing.  The unique qualities that exist only in Africa make it rip for an excellent documentary. This is one.",1384473600,,292,4.509433962264151
2871775,4,B000ROA02C,STILL WATCHING THE SERIES.  IT HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING SO FAR. HAD A LOT THAT I HADN'T SEEN BEFORE. GAINED A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION.,1382918400,,142,4.68
2871776,5,B000ROA02C,This set of videos were great visuals for the course.  They helped the students see exactly what they had learned about.  Comprehensive and beautiful photography.,1381622400,,162,5.44
2871777,5,B000ROA02C,"Excellent videography.  Fine, unobtrusive narration.  Presents many little known facts.  Compelling wild-life depictions. Well-placed animation segments.  Overall, very enjoyable and easy to watch. After viewing this a second time, all I could think of was ""I-Max 3D.""  If I had the means, it would take longer for you to read this review than the time it would take to view the movie.  But, I won't burden you with that. The videography is so spectacular that at times I thought it would have to be staged in Hollywood rather than in the wild.  The time-lapse photograhy was stunning and the wild-life footage was unbelievable. The voice-over narration was helpful but non-intrusive and showed a great deal of reasearch on the part of the producers. For a middle or high school student this is a great movie.  Given tne right amount of preparation,it could also be very productive for younger students as well.  As for me, I'm waiting for it to appear in I-Max 3-D. On a range of one to six stars, I give it a seven!",1380412800,,1017,4.732954545454546
2871778,5,B000ROA02C,Incredible cinematography and very informative - my one complaint is the music can be a bit consistently overdramatic. I watch them again and again with my kids.,1378425600,,161,5.0
2871779,5,B000ROA02C,We love these types of shows. Very interesting.  Would love to see more nature shows like this.  Very educational to watch.,1377734400,,123,4.809523809523809
2871780,4,B000ROA02C,"We just visited Africa so were watching for sentimental purposes in a way, but liked that it went all over the continent and didn't just focus on the animals, but geography, climate, etc.  Very nice photography and interesting information.",1377129600,,239,5.128205128205129
2871781,1,B000ROA02C,"This video reminded me more a music video than a documentary. There were lots of close up shots of animal mouths chewing, but not in time to the loud music.  I stopped watching because the background music is overpowering.",1373068800,,222,4.6923076923076925

2871794,5,B000ROA02C,This film is a text book example of what a nature film should be. It didn't do what a lot of nature documentaries do at the end of the films. Most would make you feel bad for the habitat destruction that someone else caused. So by the end of the documentary you leave of a feeling of sadness.,1370217600,,292,4.051724137931035

2871797,2,B000ROA02C,"I thought it was marvelous except I would for once like to watch a show without seeing the circle of life happen on the screen in front of me.  I really did not need to see a Cheetah chasing and killing (I assume as I cut it off) a very young baby gazelle.  Glad I did not pay for it because then I would be really upset.  It is Africa, it is a given that it happens, I just don't NEED to see it.",1367193600,2,396,3.6904761904761907

2871800,3,B000ROA02C,"I really like nature documentaries. This one was a little choppy with the subjects and information, like they were trying to cram as much as possible in a short timeframe.... maybe it was just edited to death though. The imagery was beautiful but if you're hoping to learn much from this one you'll be disappointed.",1366502400,,315,4.745454545454545
2871801,5,B000ROA02C,"Best ever nature program, we loved it. The photography is absolutely astounding, and the way it is organized gives you a ""bird's eye view"" of this vast and important continent",1365033600,,175,4.866666666666666

8201820,5,B000ROA02C,"BBC always has spectacular footage and this video is no exception.  It is divided into 6 parts: mountains, savannah, deserts, coasts, jungles, lakes and rivers, and the wildlife that flourishes in each of those ecologies.
