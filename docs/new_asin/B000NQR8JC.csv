8180770,3,B000NQR8JC,This was not that great to the OVA was lame to me. But the best part was the battle record of 24 episodes. The series was better than the ova to me.,1413072000,,148,3.65625
8180771,3,B000NQR8JC,"Warning: May contain a little spoiler, or a warning to those not wanting to waste their money.

This item isn't what the picture implies it is going to be about...
(Meg is NOT the action hero in this OVA)  It's mostly a sort of lost episode that wasn't included in the series for some reason or another...
I got it really cheap and still feel as though I paid a little too much for it.  But if you're a die hard fan of the series it still may be worth it to pick this up.  However if you're just a casual fan you may want to pass and maybe see if you can get it thru netflix or something.",1248134400,,588,3.9159663865546217
8180772,1,B000NQR8JC,this sucked why do 1 dvd have to cost 24.99 and than when you whatch the dvd its not that good i mean thats a waste of your money. I didn't really like this dvd this movie is not worth it burst angel was an okay anime it wasn't that great but this movie was a waste.,1208736000,,266,3.6842105263157894
8180773,1,B000NQR8JC,"Outside of the OVA which is more like a short toss away episode, the rest of the material is taken from the other episodes.  Fun if you want a quick summery of the show, based totally on the battle scenes, but nothing new.  On the other hand, the Ugetsu Hakua Special is like a music video, using the opening theme song and updated, more realistic character designs.  The girls look hot.  But I bet you could get it off the internet, so why bother to buy this DVD?  If you HAVE to buy it, get it used.",1205884800,,501,4.123711340206185
8180774,1,B000NQR8JC,"It seems that anime fans are getting screwed by the people that bring it over more and more.  I would not pay more than $5 for this dvd.  It is a single episode with a bunch of extras that are not worth the money you are going to pay.  You are better off finding a fan subbed or illegal copy on the net, instead of letting Funimation take your hard earn money for junk.",1199059200,7,369,3.9594594594594597
8180775,5,B000NQR8JC,"I thought this would just be complete filler but they actually tied things in fairly well with some of the themes of the series (e.g. the cruelty against the downtrodden) and we get to find out a little bit more about the rest of the orphans, the police officer who took them in, etc. The downside is it's basically an additional episode which hurts in the bang-for-your-buck department. Make sure you check out the character design extra - that's the part that shows things five years in the future and it adds a lot of value to this DVD. I just hope sales in Japan and here are enough to get us a lengthier OVA release or a second season!",1196812800,4,640,4.341666666666667
8180776,2,B000NQR8JC,"Don't get me wrong, I am definitley a ""Bakuretsu Tenshi"" fan. I usually go for more solid fare than Burst Angel but I fell for its quasi-western motif and old-school ""Xena-rescues-Gabrielle (again)"" format. When I heard this OVA was to be a prequel, I had hoped it would be an anime version of the (so far) Japanese-only manga. Instead we got what amounted to a one-shot episode that reveals practically nothing about our duo, doing nothing to further the overall story and nothing to develop our characters (except, perhaps, for Jo's sense of humour - i.e. the cat scene at the start, which for me was the only element worth-while).

In the end, ""Infinity"" felt like one big deleted scene amongst a bunch of other half-hearted DVD extras. It wasn't the worst episode, by far, but if you buy it, go into it knowing that it is nothing more than a ""lost"" episode that doesn't reveal much.",1196294400,15,886,4.643312101910828
8180777,5,B000NQR8JC,ITS GREAT!!!!!!!! it tells you the story of how Jo n Meg met(more in depth then ep. 15 Wild Children in the tv series) and what happens 5 years AFTER the last episode!!! I LOVED IT!!! a must see for ANY Burst Angel fan!!!!!!!,1194739200,4,225,4.136363636363637
