8167770,5,B000MCH176,"An extremely under rated movie adaptation from a novel. Excellent movie stuck between emotions, passion and some superb acting from Amitabh, Nagarjuna and not to forget hot Raveena Tandon.",1345420800,2,188,5.517241379310345
8167771,5,B000MCH176,"I saw this film back in 2005 and was completely blown away with the superior quality in every department: story-telling, cinematography, production value, directing, acting. I expected a typical 'Bollywood' film with cheap melodramatics but got a highly stylized rendition of an old Hindu myth that rivals Shakespeare's tragedies in scope and power. I highly recommend it for those who think that Indian culture is foreign and inacessible--this is a universal story that will appeal to audiences of all ages on many different levels.",1198627200,2,533,5.357142857142857
