742393,5,6303972969,"This is a good sequel to the first movie, but a bit less complex. Billy Connolly is pretty creepy, but a good actor and alleged villain. The close relationship between Mulder and Scully deepens. A good story and film to keep entertained throughout.",1520121600,,248,4.790697674418604
742394,5,6303972969,"This is the definitive X Files movie. The other one, frankly, stinks in comparison. It's almost like they were trying to throw anything X Files out to the public, and created a poor movie. This movie, however, is GREAT! Fight the Future is classic Mulder and Scully, very interesting and continues the theme of the series flawlessly. You cannot watch this movie and not believe in aliens! If you enjoyed the series, you must get this. It's the truth!",1519603200,,450,4.708860759493671
742395,3,6303972969,"The funny thing about a strip tease is that in order for it to pay off, the dancer must know her psychology. She must know that exact moment when the audience cannot endure another moment of titillation and mystery, when the last of the clothes must be flung into the audience with one bold, satisfying, catharsis-inducing gesture...and then she must act on that intuition. If she disrobes too soon, there's no buildup, no excitement. In the other hand, if she disrobes too late, or worse yet, leaves the stage still partially clothed, titillation becomes frustration, or even boredom. THE X-FILES: FIGHT THE FUTURE is (sadly), a prime example of what happens when the tease is still going long after the audience had a right to expect the payoff.

THE X-FILES TV series is the story of FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who investigate mysterious, inexplicable phenomenon. Mulder is the credulous ""believer,"" who goes into every situation assuming the wildest possible conclusion is the correct one. Scully is the ""skeptic,"" who labors to pin scientific explanations to things like spontaneous human combustion, demonic possession, and astral projection. Together, they rub along as effectively as did Kirk, Spock and McCoy, forming a sort of single personality which balances Mulder's mantra of ""I want to believe"" with Scully's scientific ""prove it to me"" approach. Though many episodes deal with such things as monsters, vampires, psychic phenomena, telekinesis, ghosts, mutations, etc., the over-arching story of THE X-FILES involves a nebulous conspiracy carried out by a nameless but seemingly all-powerful cabal of nameless men from all over the world, who seem to be preparing Earth for some kind of alien invasion. The way this central plot was approached was so piecemeal, and so full of deliberate misdirection and obfuscation, that even after five years and over 100 episodes, it wasn't clear exactly how this conspiracy was going to be carried out nor who the men of the cabal were nor what they really hoped to accomplish by facilitating it. Moreover, neither Mulder -- whose obsession with the paranormal, supernatural and extraterrestrial was triggered by the long-ago kidnapping of his sister Samantha, ostensibly by aliens -- nor Scully had yet been ""paid off"" by the sensational revelations they had been waiting for as characters and we as an audience. On top of this, the e'er-present sexual tension between the two was getting out of hand and needed some kind of resolution. So the movie was viewed, in my estimation correctly, as the moment when the show's creator, Chris Carter, finally took off THE X-FILES clothes and let us see what was underneath.

The film is set between the fifth and sixth seasons of the series. Mulder and Scully, no longer working The X-Files, are nevertheless drawn back into the alien conspiracy after a bombing in Dallas turns out to be more than the mere terrorist attack it seemed to be. Before long Mulder is contacted by a seemingly paranoid doctor (Martin Landau) who warns Mulder that the alien invasion he's suspected is in the works will be actively facilitated by the U.S. government, specifically FEMA. But Mulder, embittered by his pariah status in the Bureau and the futility of his ""hollow personal quest,"" doesn't want to hear any more conspiracy theories. However, Scully discovers the bodies of those supposedly killed in the bombing are infected with an alien virus, which may eventually be disseminated to the population via a very unusual method (hint: the carriers are very common, but not human). Their poking and prodding, conducted against the express wishes of their superiors, including the morally ambiguous Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), soon arouses the ire of the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who kidnaps Scully, already infected by the virus. Mulder must track down Scully, administer an antidote, and rescue her, which will be difficult in the extreme, given that her location is pretty much the end of the earth.

As you may have gathered from that rather brisk summary, THE X-FILES movie is not easy to quantify even as a story. Roger Ebert, who liked the film, infamously remarked that it required ""a sequel, a prequel, and Cliff notes"" to understand just what the hell is going on. Put another way, this is not a film for those who hadn't watched the show, though creator-writer Chris Carter works mightily to make it newbie-friendly. But that is by no means the problem. The real problem is that after two hours of gorgeously shot footage, during which we see Mulder & Scully chased by helicopters, bees, and armed men, several characters get blown to smithereens (including one recurring character on the show), and a flashback 35,000 years old, not to mention some aliens and a spaceship, the movie fails to pay off on any of the points I mentioned above. The conspiracy remains nebulous in its character and somewhat even in its ultimate goals. Mulder's quest for proof has lead in an enormous circle, and Scully's skepticism remains more or less intact. What's more, the resolution, or at least mollification, of the sexual-romantic tension between the two is unrelieved. It's not that the movie is bad per se -- it has its moments of humor, tension and pathos, as well as some of the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson that makes the series sing -- so much as underwhelming and almost meanly conservative. One critic claimed it was not even a movie at all, but a ""two hour episode released in theaters,"" and this is fairly accurate. I remember -- even after all these years -- leaving the theater with my girlfriend in 1998 feeling cheated, disappointed and unsatisfied, and rewatching the film recently did little to improve my overall opinion of it. It's as if Carter's intention were to hit a single and nothing more. But with all the talent and money on hand, including his own, this film could have been a double or a triple. Or even a home run.

Please don't misunderstand this review. I love THE X-FILES, and have a special place in my heart for it and for the time in which it was on the air. Indeed, when the credits of FIGHT THE FUTURE were rolling, and I heard The Foo Fighters ""Walking After You,"" I almost died from sheer nostalgia alone. But my memory of this film is also bound up with my gradual divorce from the series -- I stopped watching sometime deep in the sixth season -- out of exasperation with the refusal of the series to pay off its audience with some full frontal reveal. Now, of course, I'm slowly burning through the entire original series once again, and the new mini-series as well. So I don't want to come off as a basher or a hater. I just want to make it clear that if you watch THE X-FILES in order from beginning to now, you must steel yourself for the fact that ""the truth"" is STILL out there, waiting to be revealed...25 years later.",1518307200,,6947,4.889737065309585

742482,4,6303972969,"Upon original viewing in 1998, I remember feeling this film did not live up to expectations, primarily due to the fact that the TV series had the character and ability to accelerate the mental processes, especially when viewing the mythology story arc episodes. If one followed the series closely, the feeling was the stories were starkly original and addictive, on par with the Twilight Zone 30 years earlier.

The X-Files writers over the first 5-6 TV seasons developed the art of impressing upon the careful and thoughtful viewer that the ""real"" story was 10 times larger than what could be captured on screen; this is indeed the purpose of true film art and they delivered.

Looking back I don't feel the same level of disappointment with Fight the Future, as the years peppered with utterly mediocre and unoriginal films have filled the intervening time, with only a  few standouts that truly live up to the same expectations of originality and high entertainment (random examples: The Matrix, Mulholland Drive, 12 Monkeys, Adaptation, Inception, The Fountain, Apocalypto, etc).

X-Files, Fight the Future is still eminently watchable 20 years later. The film was made at the peak of the writers' and actors' creative stamina.",1503360000,3,1231,5.109452736318408

742912,5,6303972969,"I said better because it expands in the mythology and gives Mulder and Scully partnership an even bigger role to play asides from being more human and more fragile. The Syndicate looks a lot more manipulative and menacing and their motivations for keeping the truth or reveal it to Mulder are more grounded.
Is worst because we never see a lot of the characters that make special appearances in the show and is missing important players from the series like Krycek.
Also, they don't really follow on that almost kiss and the inevitable shift in their relationship until much later so kind of why they even went there in the first place or a full kiss would have worked as well since they got interrupted and give the shippers at least some goodies.
That being said I had been reading some comments of the old fandom after re-watching episodes and it seems that there was a huge amount of them that didn't wanted any romance between them so I understand a bit more why the show didn't commit to it until much later.
Overall I enjoyed it more than I did the first time. Love the more polished look and the improved special effects and the focus more the action and the aliens menace without so much gore the show tended to be.
Is also funny to see better curse words than son of a bitch.

742988,5,6303972969,"Amazing it took me 20 years to watch this movie when I was a fan of the show when it came out and season 6 was where I stopped watching as the show seemed to lose something.  That something was the movie and I should have realized the gaps in the story where the movie, but I was very busy at this particular time in my life having just getting my masters degree, moving from Michigan to Chicago, starting a new job, moving into a new house and having my 2nd and expecting my 3rd child.  So TV and movie's in general were taking a back seat to life then so in retrospect maybe the movie shouldn't have been so tightly linked to the long term story line of the show, because it was a high budget 2 hour episode.  A very good one, but definitely an episode because missing it left a hole in the show plot.  Good thing is all these years later I'm enjoying x-files on Netflix a great deal more as I now am watching things in sequence and many things make more sense.

So if your a fan of the show and never watched the movie, watch it and then go back and watch the end of 5 forward and things will be much clearer than before.  One strange part of the movie was how after escaping the liftoff of an (what I'm led to believe is an ancient alien space craft) Scully and Mulder are left sitting next to a huge steaming pit in Antarctica one minute and the next their home testifying before the FBI about a bunch of activity that other than the explosion of the building was only seen by our hero's.  If they were the only ones who saw it why have an investigation, unless that was the same one going on at the end of season 5 where they closed the x-files... after all they did re-open them at the end.  A few bumps in the road, but entertaining none-the-less.",1472947200,2,1755,4.126099706744868

The movie takes place between seasons 5 and 6. The movie opens up with cavemen fighting a a creature and then jumps to the present day where a boy falls into a cave in North Texas ans makes a shocking discovery. Meanwhile Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI are part of a team of agents assessing a bomb threat. The bomb goes off and the public is looking for someone to blame for the fours deaths. Mulder finds a man in a bar who tells him about a possible coverup. Without giving too much away, it is very suspenseful and almost everyone tied to the mythology makes an appearance. Assistant Director Skinner, The Lone Gunmen, the Elders of the Syndicate and the man everyone loves to hate, the Cigarette-Smoking Man (aka Cancer Man, aka Old Smokey or as I like to call him, THAT BASTARD!)

743392,4,6303972969,"This first film, when the series was at its highest point of prestige and ascent, is only some kind of variation on the themes of the series itself. Nothing new under the sun, or the full moon as for that. It got some inspiration from some Predator, Aliens or Terminator films of some kind with a super flying saucer buried deep in Antarctica and collecting abducted human beings and keeping them frozen to transport them eventually into space.

Of course Scully is abducted in such a program and finds herself frozen for transportation in this flying saucer. But Mulder will save the plot by entering the flying saucer through some backdoor, showing by the way how minimal security is for these extraterrestrials. The film is not that great about the theme. It uses a lot of clichs that had had plenty of time to settle in five years of the series, including the famous nameless cigarette chain smoker.

But this film has the main defect of a TV series turned cinema. A TV series has to be cut up in short section of 6 and a half minutes for advertising, and it is shorter than a film since it lasts less than an hour, often not more than 45 minutes. In the film they more or less respect that format though they make the sequences slightly longer and that makes the film slow altogether and slowness is a defect for an action film.

So it is some easy entertaining but nothing thrilling.

David Duchovny's reprise of Fox Mulder was brilliantly smug but still likeable, and Gillian Anderson's reprise of Dana Scully was spot on and much more impressive than I remember. She really is a very good actress and gives the film its heart and soul.

Had I had a Amazon account through my first viewing of the series a couple years ago I would imagine I wouldn't have had so much trouble trying to find the movie as I did before. I had recently found the second movie at a discount store for barely nothing so I just had to see the first. On to the review. I chose to rent said movie and picture quality in HD was just fine (of course quality of Internet connection is a variable factor but my connection is pretty standard run of the mill) which I streamed from my PS3 console through the Amazon video app which also worked fine. If your a fan of the xfiles then there isn't to much say about the movie self then.

I really liked the movie even though at times it didn't feel like a big-time movie due to the sometimes rapid jumping around/lack of tie-in between scenes.

744031,4,6303972969,"So my wife and I are young enough that we didn't watch X-Files when it was on the air, as we were both one and two years old when it premiered. Over the last couple few months we started the show on Netflix and love it to death. When we started season six, the ""previously on"" segment showed stuff that we knew we hadn't seen, so we were extremely confused until we realized it's because the movie took place in between those two seasons. Overall, the movie felt like a longer, high-budgeted episode of the show, which is fine. If you're in a position like ours, eager as we were to continue binging the show, watching the movie on Amazon may be your only option.",1460332800,,663,4.312

744133,4,6303972969,"Let me start with a little back story: My husband was watching the first episode of the X Files reboot and I had zero interest in it. I never watched it growing up - I was a cartoon-or-nothing type of girl. He decided to start from the very beginning because he forgot a lot of what happened (to be fair he was just kid too when it originally aired). I didn't plan on watching it with him because I thought it was a boring show. But it kept grabbing my attention when I was trying read. Long story short (or not? lol) I got totally obsessed and have made it through 5 seasons in under two months.

Now the actual review: I enjoyed the movie, it flows smoothly from the show. It honestly felt like I was just watching a long episode, this is not a negative. There were some scenes were the music was unnecessarily intense, almost laughable so. I can't say that it's my favorite movie of all time but it was good and it's a must watch for those watching the series.

Side note: Also I am devastated they haven't kissed yet.  I know I could just look it up but I am trying to stay surprised and so far the show has kept me deeply engrossed. But their near kiss had me rolling on floor in agony. Stupid bee.",1459382400,2,1203,4.15450643776824

744321,5,6303972969,"The X-Files ranks as one of the most intelligent and brilliant shows on television. It is a cinematic show, using techniques that are more associated with movies than the tv show (like the long unedited sequence in Triangle). Admittedly it was once a better show than it is now, but most episodes are minor masterpieces. But when it peaks, like with ""Redux"", ""Triangle"", and ""One Son"", it peaks like no other show has before.

It is completely unclassifiable. It is a mystery, a sci-fi, and sometimes self parody, and the show has several markedly sexual overtones (the cigarette smoking man). The sexual tension is what has probably attracted the most people. The byplay between Mulder and Scully is cool and reserved, yet you wonder exactly what they're really thinking.

It pays homage to old shows, and movies as well (""Duel in the Sun"", ""Rope""). This show doesn't always give you what you want.

Though it has gotten more Hollywood-ish, it's a testament to the creators and writers that they haven't put Scully and Mulder together (will they or won't they? Probably. It is Hollywood, after all).

This show is a thinking person's show. Sometimes it does get slow, but it always remains interesting.

744440,3,6303972969,"Buy the Blu-ray version. The DVD version is 720 x 480 resolution. The transfer to DVD is horrible. Most definitely not transfered from the original master copy, there was way too many scratches and grain on the video. The focus, color, brightness, and contrast all seemed off. The video seems to have way too much Red and not enough Blue, Most likely due to natural degradation of film once exposed to oxygen and other contaminates. Seems like the transfer was rushed to DVD. I put the DVD in my computer DVD player and ran it with VLC player with many filters and post processing, and it cleaned it up slightly.

It really shed some light on some of the major plot points that have been developed in the show up to this point.  It still had the same air of mystery and intrigue that I have come to love.

745436,5,6303972969,"Taking place between season 5 and season 6, Fight the Future is a marvelously sketched movie based on the TV series that ties together the all the show's E.T mythology pieces from past seasons. The film opens sometime in 30,000 BC in what would later become North Texas, where 2 cavemen hunters encounter a large alien like form and a short scuffle ensues. In the midst of the fight, one of the cavemen is infected with a black, oily goo like substance that crawls into his skin.

The film cuts to modern day 1998 where a group of young boys are digging a hole alongside a deserted field. One of the boys falls inside the hole and has the same black substance fill his body, all the way to his head, causing his eyes to turn black. Since the closure of the X-Files, Scully and Mulder have been assigned to work on other projects. This time they're helping investigate and stop a bomb threat in a federal building in downtown Dallas. After failing to successfully detonate the bomb in which $45 million dollars worth of damage was done in addition to 5 people as well as a special agent who allowed the bomb to go off, were killed in the explosion, officials at a job evaluation hearing consider splitting Scully and Mulder up.

Later that evening, Mulder conveniently meets well known conspiracy author and paranoid doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil, who shares with Mulder, information of a conspiracy to hide the truth about the bombing. With his assistance, the duo of Mully and Sculder risk their lives and careers to hunt down a deadly extraterrestrial virus, leaked by a mysterious group of powerful elites that could erase the human race on earth.

Overall: To put it simple, if you like the TV show then you'll live Fight the Future. The thing is, this installation of Fight the Future can and will be confusing to those who watch as the plot manages to flip flop (all for a bigger picture on the upside) from time to time and will have you abusing the rewind button to try and see if you can make sense of certain things. Despite the wide, 2-3 layered plot, it all leaves way for an entertaining ride for the duration of this film as we see TV's favorite investigating duo look for answers to put a stop to what could be the end of all mankind.",1453507200,2,2243,4.506142506142506

After reading various (negative) reviews, I thought I would hate this show. However, I actually found it watchable and relatively enjoyable, though I agree that, as a stand alone film, it lacked coherency and brilliance. The movie felt more like one long, extended episode than anything else (and it wasn't even one of the best episodes), and the material wasn't really worth turning into a feature-length film, but I do think the movie is a must-see for X-Files fans.",1442016000,,508,4.9186046511627906

746485,4,6303972969,"I never had any desire to watch this when it was actually on TV, even though I love sci-fi, because I happened to see bits of shows which seemed visually and dramatically dreary. I'm in about the middle of Season 6 at the time of this review. So glad I have another chance to see this show, which does not come across as dated (in spite of the chunky cell phones and DOS computer screens for the first several years of it!). I love the relationship between Scully and Mulder. I love the humor. I love that for most of the episodes, it begins leading you in a certain direction that you know is not where it's going to end up - but it is usually very difficult to predict where it actually does end up! Some of the episodes are very dark, some are thrillers, some are horror shows, some are mostly comedic, which provides a nice variety (although so far only a couple of the satiric/humorous ones have appealed to me.

It seems clear that they were trying to make too many different kinds of viewer happy here, catering to both up-to-date fans and newcomers to the franchise, and weirdly this resulted in a finished product that I think probably strongly appeals to neither.

Too many plot holes, weird directing/editing decisions, patches of forced dialogue, and other knock-you-out-of-the-moment-problems to truly say I enjoyed it.  Mediocre at best, disappointing when you consider how good the series can be at times.",1433030400,2,596,5.252631578947368

I think they did an excellent job with the movie, although I have to say that if you are not up to the speed of at least the previous 5 seasons it might not make as much since. I just finished binge watching the first 5 seasons and than immediately watched the movie and I still had to rewind and re-watch haha! But my advice to you....Go watch the rest of it!

747072,3,6303972969,"I was a fan of the original series so my review might be a little bias. Overall its has pretty decent acting paired with okay writing. My only problem with it was it seemed like they tried to mash to much into the movie. Its like they had a check box of things that had to be accomplished within the time limit they gave the movie and some of the scenes just seemed forced. Some characters from the series will randomly pop in to do something non-consiquential and pop back out with very little explaining who they were in the first place, and near the end of the movie is a pretty sizable plot hole.",1431043200,,600,4.226086956521739

747075,2,6303972969,"I'm being generous and giving this 2 stars just because I like X-Files, but this really doesn't deserve that high of a score. First off, the story line was pretty decent. Rather typical X-Files with aliens, a virus, black slime, but that's why we watch it. This film tried to be something more than it should have though. Too much of OMG Drama (always with very poor camera work so you have trouble seeing what is actually happening. What good is a close up shot if we can't tell what we are looking at? This film just annoyed me to no end.",1430524800,,540,4.303921568627451

It furthers the plot and unveils answers to some of the show's mysteries, but still leaves enough unanswered to keep the series's suspense going.  That said, standing on its own, this is just an OK movie.  The compelling parts of the movie are the mystery unveils, so if you haven't been following the TV series, much of the satisfaction will be lost.  There isn't much in the way of character development, for example: everyone behaves more or less as you'd expect from the show.

747874,3,6303972969,"X-Files is definitely one of my top ten shows of all time.  I had high hopes for this movie, but unfortunately they were not met by a long shot.  While not an outright horrible film, its not a good one either.  One thing about it that really makes me glad I saw it once though (and ensures I give it 3 stars instead of 2), is that we get answers.  Thats right, honest-to-God answers.  Like I said in my season 5 review, the myth arc honestly progressed enough to renew my interest, and even though it didn't end satisfactorily here at least we got a major revelation.  There were also a couple good scares, the Lone Gunmens cameo was great, I loved the romance between Mulder and Scully, and the climax in Antarctica was pretty thrilling.  But in the end, it was all for naught.  I know it was often that way on the small screen, but this is a movie and movies should have some resolution.  I mean, what if the show had not been renewed?  It would have been a pretty sorry way to end the series.  If I were writing this, I would have had Mulders victory in Antarctica mess up the Syndicates plans big time and though theyd still be out there, it would take a while for them to recover.  Ah well, I still have at least 2 more seasons of the show to review before I quit (seasons 6 & 7; I will try 8 and even 9 if I see them cheap enough).  So in conclusion while it could have been much better, it could have been worse.  I am glad I saw it, but I won't be seeing it again.",1416268800,,1472,4.065972222222222

Having been a fan of the TV series from the beginning, I originally saw the movie when it premiered in 1998. It plays like a 2 hour episode, which to me is great because it draws you into it deeper and you feel like you've stepped into the show. There are a few characters missing but that's to be expected. But the ones they are replaced with, give more depth. The dynamic between Mulder & Scully is just as strong as ever and there's even more of a hint at something growing between them, that would eventually be revealed later in the series. It's not a love story but a story of one man, one woman and a quest for the truth.....",1414800000,,740,4.204225352112676

748019,5,6303972969,"Created by Chris Carter and James Wong, The X-Files drew a massive fan base worldwide and become a cult phenomenon, during the Clinton Administration, that earned the series 6 Emmy Awards and induced the FBI to launch an entire department devoted to the research of paranormal phenomena and ufology, which is now open to the public through the Freedom of Information Act on their on-line website's Unclassified Documents in their Electronic Reading Room, which can be accessed by anyone interested in these topics, and is loosely based on real life British Ministry of Defense Intelligence Officer, Nike Pope, who began his career as a skeptic but became a true believer after four years of research and investigation into the topic of ufology, much in the same way that Dr. J. Allen Hayneck, head of Project Blue Book (a project initiated resultant of Jimmy Carter's response to immense public pressure to tackle the topic, following his sighting of a UFO while he was the governor of Georgia), turned from a sceptic to a true believer after years of investigation on the topic and quit Project Blue Book in disgust at the US government's attempt to debunk UFO sightings to form MUFON.

Well researched and meticulously detailed, Duanne Barry and Ascension could very well pass as a true life story of alien abduction - from the blinding light prior to abduction, to the feeling of helplessness, the temporary paralysis, to the apprehension of shadowy forms, to the missing time, to the medical probes aboard extraterrestrial crafts, to the implantation of tracking devises (which invariably appears on X-rays confounding medical experts), to the mysterious appearances of scars on the abductees bodies, to the post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by victims of abduction that induces them to seek psychiatric counselling (from the likes of preeminent Harvard psychiatrist and professor, Dr. John E. Mack, who initially diagnosed abduction cases as screen memories of childhood sexual abuse to the gradual realization of the converse - that memories of childhood sexual abuse comprise screen memories of abduction), to the forming of support groups by abductees for the purpose of consensual validation in the midst of public disbelief and ridicule.

The conclusions proposed by the X-Files story arc is pretty much based on the conclusions reached by David M. Jacobs, professor of history at Temple University, presented in his book, The Threat: Presenting the Secret Alien Agenda - in which he hypothesizes that the purpose of alien abduction is to produce alien-human hybrids who will serve as slaves after the process of collimation is set in motion and becomes inevitable.

Duanne Barry and Ascension revolves around the story of Duanne, an ex-FBI agent, who is the subject of a covert government operation to provide the Grays with human subjects for experimentation in order to delay the process of colonization, taking a group of people and his psychiatrist hostage in order to subject his psychiatrist to the experience of alien abduction, being talked into releasing his hostages in return for Mulder, who, then, asks Duanne to lock the door to open him to the line fire by a SWOT team, who, regains consciousness after being shot, and being told Scully's whereabouts by Alex Krycek, breaks into Scully's home, abducts her and takes her to Skyline Mountain where the aliens abduct Scully in his place and impregnates her, the story arc of which will not be completed until season seven.

One Breath resumes where Duanne Barry and Ascension left off, with Scully resurfacing after the alien human hybrid with which she has been impregnated spontaneously aborting prior to her discovery by Mulder, leaving no signs of having been pregnant - much in the same manner that real life abductees find themselves pregnant after an abduction, only to discover the fetus spontaneously aborting, leaving no signs of having been pregnant (confounding medical specialist), in a coma with Mulder staying by her bedside throughout her indisposal, and getting himself acquainted with her sister, who fervently believes in spiritual healing, and her antagonistic brother, who is skeptical on the subject of ufology and blames Mulder for his sister's condition, regaining consciousness after a phantom nurse encourages her not to let the strings that binds  her to the living break, and being handed the cross which she had had on her person from Mulder - who had been entrusted with the relic for safekeeping by her mother.

Colony and End Game resumes the story arc where One Breath had left off, with Mulder discovering a string of deaths in abortion clinics being run by alien clones, and assigning his cohort to investigate the death, only to find himself being accused of the murder of his colleague, who is murdered by a shape shifting alien (who happens to be a bounty hunter), and being contacted by his father, who informs him of the reemergence of his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted by aliens when she was at a tender age, only to discover, much to his dismay, that Samantha is an alien clone, who is engineering alien human hybrids to gain stewardship of this planet, and are being pursued by the bounty hunter because the experiments were not sanctioned and considered a dilution of their race, and, is like I've pointed out, loosely based on Professor David M. Jacbobs hypothesis that the grays are attempting to create alien human hybrids to serve as slaves to facilitate the colonization of earth.

Anasazi, The Blessing Way and Paper Clip resumes where Colony and End Game left off, with Mulder being contacted by an IT genius who had hacked into Top Secret intelligence documents being kept by the DOD, and handing the DAT on which these documents have been downloaded to Mulder (much to his elation), only to discover the files encrypted in Navaho, and finding himself being introduce to the burial site of grays who perished resultant of the MJ12's experimentations with the aliens (in the similar manner that the Clinton administration had subjected thousands of Americans to biological experimentations leading to massive lawsuits by the unwitting subjects of these experimentations for physiological and psychological duress), and, having being alerted of the leak, inducing Cigarette Smoking Man to send his son to kill Mulder's father  and attempt to have Mulder killed by blasting the site, only to find him being discovered hanging on the thread of life by the Navaho chief who had decrypted the DOD files and pointed him to the burial site, and performed Navaho healing rituals, bringing him back to life - whereupon he appears to Scully in a dream, signifying his eminent reappearance, while Scully discovers a devise impregnated in her neck that appears to be a microchip tooled utilizing technology far more advanced than anything earthly and is encouraged by her sister to undergo hypnotic regression to uncover what had transpired during her abduction  (the repressed memory which she subconsciously rejects due to her scientific background that closes her off to extreme possibilities), and finding herself being warned by one of the MJ12 members of an impending attempt on her life - which leads her into a gun draw with Skinner, during which time Mulder reappears, and draws his gun on Skinner, who then relinquishes his weapon and reveals that the DAT had fallen into his hands - which he then uses to bargain with Cigarette Smoking Man to have both Scully and Mulder reinstated, only to find himself being accosted by two agents sent by Cigarette Smoking Man, who steals the DAT from him and leaves him unconscious, while, Scully and Mulder, during consultation with the Lone Gunman, examining a photograph taken during WWII (where his father appears with members of MJ12 and Nazi scientists), being brought to recall Operation Paper Clip (a true life Secret Operation following WWII - where one half of the top Nazi scientists were appropriated by the US government, and the other half by USSR, to help advance their aeronautical research which led to the engineering of advanced military aircraft by the DOD as Black Ops), leading to an encounter with a Nazi scientist who had worked on secret experimentation with the gray using small pox, and being pointed to a warehouse that contains files of all alien abductees, including those of Scully and Samantha - during which time, Mulder discovers that Samantha's file was originally meant to be his, which leads him to exact the truth about his father's involvement in MJ12 from his mother, even as Skinner manages to get Mulder and Scully reinstated, and the X-Files reopened by threating to expose the contents of the DAT by revealing to Cigarette Smoking Man that the Navaho who had decrypted the DAT had transmitted the documents contained in the DAT to others through the oral tradition, the story arc of which resumes in The X-Files: Black Oil.

Anasazi, The Blessing Way and Paper Clip, the first three part episode that concludes Part 1 of the mythology series draws heavily on Top Secret Majestic 12 documents, which were leaked out by an intelligence operative that identifies twelve prominent figures during the Roosevelt Administration who were chosen to conduct reverse engineering on the crashed saucer at Roswell under the directive of J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the FBI under the Roosevelt Administration, and to monitor and research UFO sightings and encounters while keeping a lid on the issue and documents the frustration felt by the American public at the government cover-up that has induced the American public to form Citizens Against UFO Secrecy that have filed numerous lawsuits against the American government and forced her to release thousands of badly censored Top Secret documents pertaining to ufology that were being held in the vaults of the Intelligence Agencies.

Maybe this was the point of the movie to extend the X-Files into a movie to say goodbye to the characters since all the original main characters (Scully, Mulder, Skinner, & the mysterious Cigarette Smoking Man) were involved. Like in previous episodes Scully & Mulder have to deal with the consequences of their actions to the FBI in which the ways in which they cannot provide evidence for their work and whatnot. So this plot is similar to the majority of the episodes. The movie was played immediately through Amazon Prime Instant Video so no issues through their technology.

749083,5,6303972969,"I started watching X-Files when I was in high school, and only made it a few episodes in. In the modern era of on-demand TV series and movies, I read a review that stated, ""The X-Files may be the best show in the history of television."" I was reluctant to believe it until I finished this movie.

The characters, the drama, cinematography, story lines - both immediate and global - are brilliant. TV isn't over, and there are many stories yet to be told, but I'm compelled to keep watching.

And while I don't think it's a pending alien invasion, I do believe that Mulder and Scully bring to light the very real possibility that there is more going on in the world in terms of government conspiracy, public manipulation and downright evil than we would ever want to know about.

On the other hand, if you have never seen the TV Series, I would recommend getting Season 1 of the series and go thru at least the first several episodes.  This movie assumes that the viewer is already familiar with the basic storyline, characters, etc.  so if you watch it cold, without knowing a little about the history, you'll probably be lost and be disappointed.

Whoever was responsible for continuity should never be allowed to work again. How coulld someone be hit in the head by a bullet..and then walk out with out a scatch..just hours later. And then have it magically reappear towards the end of the movie. Hastily slapped together......not really even that much fun. Big thumbs down on this one.,1403568000,,487,4.809523809523809

I was sad because I would miss a huge chunk of plot. So, I was ecstatic when I found it on prime. This film was amazing as well. I love David Duchovny.

However, as a standalone film it works much better and I like it a lot. The ending is a problem (the aforementioned comms/transport problems), but overall it is fun.",1402617600,,480,4.517241379310345

749531,3,6303972969,"Have been getting into X-files lately due to the cool and complex characters and interesting sci-fi stories and I would definitely recommend the series, and therefore this movie, if you are a fan of the Genre. I bought it after I ran into the gap between seasons 5 and 6 on netflix and had to watch this movie to advance the plot line. The movie promised to reveal the secrets behind the conspiracies running throughout the show, and for the most part it explained them pretty well, but for some reason the entire main plot line feels like a break from reality for me personally. This is not something that suddenly happens in the movie, so you will know if it is a problem for you going into it and that doesn't really take away from the aspects of the show I enjoy.

At the end of the day if you are invested in the show this film will answer many of the cryptic questions the show has introduced and move the plot forward, but don't go into the movie with huge expectations. This movie defintitely feels like it was forced into being a big budget movie with blockbuster action flick moments when I don't think it really adds anything. The super wide screen shooting also just feels weird and distant after the standard 4:3 episodes, but it kept me entertained.",1400371200,,1263,4.467532467532467

749673,4,6303972969,"This had more potential to be something truly magnificent, but the creators chose to keep it close to the nub.  I would have loved them to take more risks and develop an alternate history.  Why is it that Mulder and Scully never take photos of all of the things they have seen in the years?  I would've imagined that Mulder would want to capture proof with photography or footage of some kind.

Back to back related episodes would have been better but then I'd be writing that it just seemed like back to back episodes. It's tough turning an awesome episodic show into a movie. It wasn't great, but I enjoyed it. If you're an X-files fan, I'd still recommend it because it is still X-files. If you are new to the series, where have you have been? and start with the series first.

749748,4,6303972969,"I recently watched the majority of the X-Files on netflix. I inevitably caught up to the movie. I was happy to easily rent it from Amazon Instant Video. I generally enjoyed the film. I find that with formulaic TV shows like the X-Files, I often like to multi-task and watch while playing a handheld game system. After a certain point, it just becomes entertaining to hear the characters' voices and occasionally look up to see where they are currently running for their life. The movie's plot was somewhat interesting to me. I found the movie's overall investment to be in expanding the show's mythology which I personally had stopped feeling interested in after season 3. All in all, this film survives on the chemistry of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as Mulder and Scully. Their relationship and banter have always entertained me. My one piece of advice is to see this film as a sort of hybrid between an episode of the X-Files and a feature film. The pacing is sometimes more TV than film, while the budget is definitely Hollywood. I don't think this movie is nearly as enjoyable without 5 or so seasons of the X-Files under my belt. I tried watching it before when I as younger and only had watched bits and pieces of the series, and it really didn't do anything for me. A much better experience with the series context.",1391904000,,1331,4.6440677966101696

749953,3,6303972969,"I have a great fondness for the X-files in TV format. In fact, that was one my main attractions; each individual episode was practically a mini-movie in and of itself! Captivating character developments, expert pacing, well-timed surprises and unpredictable twists and turns, etc. The movie tries to way too hard to pack in all that deliciously dramatic, scientifically mysterious, episodic story-telling in just two measly hours! Other fans out there would agree, I'm sure, that sometimes a single SEASON isn't enough to see a story arc all the way through, hence the final episode cliffhangers and such. Stories told through the multi-installment format of weekly television have been perfected by various writers over the last couple of decades. Grinding that perfection through the jagged teeth of the instant-gratification, one-stop movie model not only can distort a formulaic standard, but perverts the very art of week-to-week writing.",1378166400,,943,5.465753424657534

As a side note, all 9 Seasons of the X-Files TV Show are (as of this review) part of Amazon Prime ($79.99/year); but you'd better hurry and watch them all because Amazon doesn't tell anyone when the contracts on movies or tv shows end (my child and I have found this out the hard way unfortunately).

By the point in which the movie occurs, she has been beat up, abducted, and impregnated by ""non-human"" beings, and now her skepticism just seems a bit ridiculous...like they are forcing her to fit her original character from the first seasons.",1370649600,,523,4.695652173913044

Chris Carter definitely goes all out for this movie and I could watch it multiple times and not find any flaws.  This movie helps explain the X-files for true followers (lol) and doesnt lose the crowd for those who haven't been following the series.

750122,4,6303972969,"The X-Files, which set a new standard for science fiction during its nine year run, alternated between two types of scripts, stand-alone episodes and long story arcs.  The four mythology sets contain most of the story arc scripts.  This, the first set, established the premise of the series.  There are unexplained sightings of UFOs, and hints of a massive conspiracy involving government officials and private organizations.  As more evidence is uncovered, there are indications of cloning, genetic manipulation, and alien abductions.  The ambience is one of perpetual paranoia, while the mysteries are often unresolved.  The series also relied heavily on character development.  The interplay between the two leads - the skeptical, scientific Sculley (Gillian Anderson) and the mystical, obsessive Mulder (David Duchovny) soon began to set the tone for the upcoming drama, and provided an effective backdrop for the plots.",1361923200,,924,5.557142857142857

750277,4,6303972969,"Originally known simply as ""The X-Files"" but now as ""The X-Files: Fight the Future,"" this 1998 film is essentially an elongated episode of the TV series with a bigger budget. I've never been more than a casual viewer and, to me, this film represents the best the series had to offer.

Everyone knows that creator Chris Carter was inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Stalker-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000EOTV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Stalker - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;when he formulated The X-Files. Whereas that brief 70s series was overt and almost cartoony with it's depictions of the paranormal, The X-Files always took a more subdued, realistic approach. To some, this made it boring; to others, fascinating; to many, a mixture of both.

The way the plot in the movie unfolds is similar to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark-Special-Edition/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>,"" albeit more serious and quasi-believable. After an explosion reminiscent of the Oklahoma City bombing, FBI agents Mulder and Scully stumble on an otherworldy virus and an intricate governmental cover-up. Their investigation leads them all over the map and, ultimately, to Antarctica, with numerous mysterious happenings.

Other than the paranormal, the appeal of The X-Files has always been Gillian Anderson. What a uniquely beautiful redhead!

The film runs two hours and was shot in California, British Columbia, Texas, New Jersey, London and Washington DC.

I didn't really know much about the X-files I remember the re-runs on UPN scaring me when I was little and that creepy theme song. Anyways the date that got my attention was the original air date of the Colony episode it was 3 days after my birth. I think its a cool show I just want to see the rest,1343260800,,446,3.65625
750397,4,6303972969,"I've been viewing these Mythology volumes a bit out of order but I now own the first three with this being the last purchased. I will probably not be getting the forth because I don't care much for the super-soldier stories or the last couple seasons. I wouldn't say I followed the X-Files religiously when it was on the air but I am a fan and caught episodes when I could, many of them already reruns at the time. Having said that I do not own any of the full seasons so I went the easier, and cheaper, route of purchasing most of the Mythology Collection.

I have thorougly enjoyed most of the episodes offered in this collection, with volume one being my favorite; however, I don't really know why each volume was given titles/themes (Abduction, Black Oil, Colonization, Super Soldiers) when the eps were arranged chronologically with a fair amount overlap of the themes. In other words, there are black oil eps outside of the Black Oil volume; abduction eps outside of the Abduction volume; and colonization eps outside of the Colonization volume. Why not just call them The X-Files Mythology Collection: Volume # and leave it at that, especially since there is no mention of a volume number anywhere on the product itself? Also, as a few other commentors have mentioned, why include eps with new characters and events without also including the ep where they debuted/occured; such as X and Krycek appearing out of nowhere in ""Duane Barry""? I don't think adding a few more eps that directly relate to the Mythology, even if the individual story/plot may not, is too much to ask since the whole reason for this collection is to further milk the series. If for some reason there was a limit on the number of eps that could be used most of the forth volume could've been omitted IMO in favor of eps like ""Sleepless"" or others that further support the core of the mythology.

Overall I think this is a great compilation from a truely amazing series. Casual and curious fans alike would enjoy these volumes and if you haven't already started collecting the full seasons I would recommend getting these. However, there are still some fantastic X-Files episodes that are not related to the mythology, and therefore not in this collection, that will be missed if these are the only eps watched.",1342656000,,2290,4.708229426433915

750401,4,6303972969,"I had just finished watching all the TV episodes and decided to see this movie as well. I'm told it fits in between season 5 and season 6, but really it's a pretty effective story as a stand-alone.

Fox Muldur and Dana Skully are in front of a review board for having done more than they were asked to do. This is typical of the series, but a movie audience might not know this. They were in Texas when the FBI regional office in Dallas was blown up, and they were accused of not doing enough to see that the building was empty. Suspicion fell on Muldur because he found the bomb which was concealed in a soda dispensing machine. One of the local agents said he could defuse it, and ordered everyone out of the building. But he made no attempt to defuse the bomb, blowing himself up with the building.

Two fire fighters and a small boy were also reported as killed in the explosion, but in fact Skully autopsied one of the bodies and discovered that they were already dead when the bomb went off. And the cause of death made it clear that the bombing was to conceal the cause of death. From here, faithful followers of the TV series can probably predict much of the plot.

Still, there are exciting adventures, amazing location shots, and really horrible monsters. It should be just the thing for teen-agers.

And the chronically paranoid. The question is, are you paranoid enough?",1336694400,,1382,4.472222222222222

750459,4,6303972969,"this movie certainly brings back memories.  I remember clearly when this was released in the summer of '98.  I saw it at the cinema in Thomasville, GA at ""Gateway Cinemas"" and the theater was completely full.  The film went on to become a big box office hit.

this film incorporates some of the mythology of the series (unlike the second film).  So, you have references to colonization, government conspiracy, and aliens in the mix.  That is a lot of plot to stuff in one film, but the film finds a nice balance in telling the story, which serves as a bridge narrative between the seasons # 5 and # 6 of the television series.  The film intentionally leaves threads hanging, so that the viewer will find answers in season 6.

this was at a time when TXF was peaking in its popularity in the U.S. and around the world.  Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are in their finest form here.  Incidentily, I've heard rumors that there is going to be a 3rd x-files movie, likely to be released in Dec. 2012.  Stay tuned!",1315872000,,1013,4.48087431693989

750461,5,6303972969,"The Black Oil Virus was quite a mystery in the TV series, but this movie which debuted while that series was still being written, truly put a new face on the concept of virus incubation. Calculating, ruthless and violent as the prey he was stalking, the primeval human hunts the alien creature across an icy world of snow and caves, probably for food, possibly in competition for resources.

So we are introduced to the progenitors of the Black Oil Virus, surmised to be the original inhabitants of this planet.  Authentic 20th century mythology.  And of course the debate among scientists about whether a virus is an organism or an organ is ongoing because reproduction is the ONLY life cycle/feature of a virus.  (Like junk introns in an RNA chain.)

Art and reality imitating one another; even while the Catholic church is daily assaulted for the scandalous behavior of pedophile priests, the X-Files fiction also employs an antagonist physician being castigated with publicized allegations of pedophilia.  Ultimately the same 'syndicate' who conspire to defame him conclude that only the most severe eradication efforts will suffice to silence him.

Although the space ship makes occasional appearances in the TV series, it's here, in a land-looked facility in Fight the Future.  And as yet another antagonist out of the series (British member of the syndicate), informs Mulder, 'Only when you find Scully will you begin to appreciate the scope and grandeur of the the ""project"".'",1303862400,,1484,5.103305785123967

Fortunately it is worlds better than the sequel, ""X-File, I Want to Believe."" If by chance you've only seen the sequel rest assured this movie is vastly superior. The action never stops and carries the viewer along at a fast pace that brings the movie to a close before you're really ready for it to end.

If you're a sci-fi fan or an X-Files fan and haven't watched this movie I think you'll find it worth your time.",1301356800,,611,4.126050420168068
750464,5,6303972969,"On one level you have Fox Mulder and the X-Files he found and has looked into. Why? Because of Samantha and the things that go bump outside. Enter Skully and enter Skinner and enter a lot of other things. Sometimes these are good and sometimes these are bad but, mostly, they turn out to be disappointing to the workers - not the watchers. On another level you have a storyline within this storyline, allowing a person to see beyond the ""veil."" While this might seem easy to pick out at first, some of the episodes are hard to distinguish. Out of the 9 seasons that are available, there are 60 such stories that play in an arch or sorts, spanning 4 sets. These are Abduction, Black Oil, Colonization, and Super Soldier. While the last is questionable because of the way the first 6 end, they all complete an inner storyline and are quite interesting to see as they play out.

Before beginning, one thing should be mentioned. Each of the sets comes with a layout that shows the timeline and the major players on it and that should be in the set. Each set connects to the other, and these should be here. It is the one thing that I really would stress having, because not having it makes for missing out on an interesting level. As for anything else, you have some interviews and you have some special features, but these are not that big. You manage one per three episodes or so, and that doesn't really make for a lot. Still, the paper with the timeline is a must and is nice to have.

The major players listed in Abduction are Mulder, Skully, Skinner, C.G.B. Spender (Smoking Man), Krycek, Deep Throat, The Lone Gunmen, and Samantha Mulder. Each plays a role and some play heavier roles than others. Also noted here is the fact that the timeline starts with the movie and that is nice. It goes all the way back to the beginning, and that is nice. It shows how everything fits togetther and that part of the puzzle is nice to understand.

When watching these, they are nice and important to check in order. Not seeing one set in order diminishes the next, and some fit together well. Black Oil is one that crosses into the others, for eample, and all of them deal with aliens. So, missing one means not knowing the crucial crux of just what is taking place.

I think this deserves a 5/5 but I have to say that it is something you do not really need. Fans and some watchers might like it quite a bit, but you can see all of this just by watching the seasons. That said, it is easy not to get the whole of the subject matter and I like that part. If you would like it, too, you would note it from the want/need you feel.

750520,5,6303972969,"""Fight the Future"" was originally conceived as the big movie wrap-up to five superb televisions seasons of ""The X-Files"". For fans of this great science fiction series, it offers the series stars, FBI Agents Mulder and Scully, in hot pursuit of the facts at the heart of a quixotic quest for the truth.  All the series regulars make an appearence, from the Lone Gunmen to the Cigarette-Smoking Man to Deputy Director Skinner.  And for newcomers, it may contain the clearest statement of the grand conspiracy that moved the show.

As the movie opens, the discovery of a prehistoric virus leads to the destruction of a federal office building in Oklahoma City and then to a global hunt for the elusive members of a conspiracy dedicated to concealing a staggering truth, and to eliminating any threat to that conspiracy...

Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is really set-up for another television season than a true resolution of the story line.  ""Fight the Future"" is still highly recommended to fans of the series.",1282608000,,1019,4.935672514619883

750523,4,6303972969,"The X Files Fight the Future has the same feel as an episode of the series. There are many of the characters that you would see in the series, such as the Cigarette Smoking Man and The Well-Manicured Man. The film begins with the X Files closed, and Mulder and Scully assigned to other work. However, events happens which pique Mulder's interest into reopening the X-Files, and from here he and Scully take measures to find evidence into this.

The opening scene sets the stage for the film. In North Texas, in the year 15000 B.C., Neanderthals discover what appears to be an alien life form in a cave. A struggle ensues, and it appears as though the caveman has killed the alien. However, a black substance emits from the alien and runs up the body of the caveman. Years later, in present day, boys are playing around the same area when one of them discovers a human skull in the hole. The same black liquid comes up from the ground and goes up the boy's body; his friends, terrified, scamper off and try to locate help. When firemen come to rescue them, they suffer the same fate, and the hole is sealed, presumably to cover up evidence. The film shifts to Dallas, where Scully and Mulder are investigating a bomb threat atop a building downtown. The bomb explodes despite Mulder warning a bomb in time to save the building, and then Mulder learns that there is evidence someone wanted whatever was in the building destroyed. (Mulder later learns, from a paranoid doctor Kurtweil that those people in the building, including the boy, had already been dead before the bomb exploded, and that someone was trying to hide something). After being reprimanded during an investigation into the bombing, Scully seems intent on quitting, but it is Mulder who tries to convince her to continue on, his hunch being that all is not right, and that they need to keep going, trying to find the truth. Convincing her to accept his theories, Mulder investigates further, and comes across information from an informant that a virus may be spreading, creating a new extraterrestrial entity that the government is trying to cover up. Mulder goes to many extremes to try to find evidence that will finally prove his ideas correct; this takes Scully and Mulder to morgues, along highway roads, cornfields, mysterious buildings and even Antarctica. As probably expected, the plot does get a little convoluted at times and you will have to suspend some belief and maybe scratch your head, but most of the action is quite in line with the mood of the series, and I thought it worked well with the film.

There is also great chemistry between Mulder, the theorist, and Scully, the realist. Most series don't make great transitions, but I think this one did. Some say the ending may be anticlimactic; I thought it was perfect, and could not have ended any other way. My biggest beef was that, after this film's release in 1999, they let this go so long with a sequel.  Why did it take ten years for them to come up with a follow-up movie, with all the momentum of the show killed?  I haven't seen the second episode, I Want to Believe, but I hear that it wasn't very good, so it seems that the wait wasn't quite worth the wait.

Still, this episode is quite relevant to the series, and a great DVD to own for a price that is fairly cheap. Another great aspect of the film is that you can enjoy even if you weren't a regular viewer of the series. The disc also includes some extras, such as a making of documentary.",1277856000,,3490,4.586538461538462

""The X-Files"" is my favorite T.V. show of all time. It has a great plot, great acting by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (Mulder and Scully)

The acting was typical X Files so for the fan, you would not be dissappointed and for the newby you would really understand the characters being in character.

Additionally, this movie takes you all around the world, you basically visit four continents, Africa, Europe, North America and the South Pole. Great FX support a great story line.

Right now, at $5.99 at Amazon is a great price for a movie who previously was considered ""Hard to find"" and was going past $60 on Ebay. I took away a star for pacing. There are slow, boring moments in between decent action and dialogue, and while there is good amount of Mulder and Scully, there is not enough of them together to rate an excellent 5 stars.

750617,5,6303972969,"THE X-FILES (Fight the Future) was a great five star film for loyal fans  as well as non-viewers alike. I was as pleased with this first film as I was unhappy with the second. This first movie was fast paced and left the viewer no time to look back. To be honest, the story was over and neatly resolved before I knew it and there wasn't a second to be spared.

The film flowed beautifully from the TV series to the big screen and from one scene to the next, and every special effects shot was breathtaking. I especially enjoyed the final scenes which presented Scully's rescue by Mulder and their narrow escape from a huge alien spacecraft.  These grand scenes made the long running X-Files story larger than life, adding new dimension to the series. This X-Files movie delivered on every possible level and was extremely well thought out and executed, and was one of Chris Carter's best productions ever!

I saw this film in a very good big screen movie theater when it opened and it made for an excellent viewing experience. Chris Carter could not have done a better job of recruiting new viewers with this film which was a wonderful showcase for the look, color, flavor and wonderful mood of the X-Files.

It's this adherence to the long-standing thread, however, that leads to some disappointment. I always considered the TV series to be at its most creative and inventive when it produced the so-called ""Monster of the Week"" episodes, in which the thread was sidelined in favour of a standalone story. These were nearly always more satisfying, and often even more weird and wonderful in scope.

It was one of the best decisions i ever made while shopping, absolutely no regrets. I was introduced to a great show with a great cast.

Since watching season one on DVD i kept house hunting to find my old VHS tape. Unfortunately, i could not find it anywhere. I picked up the movie recently because the original release had been discontinued. Now that the 2nd movie is out, the original has been re-released. I picked this up and must say i am blown away.

750624,5,6303972969,"The X-Files: Fight the Future makes a wonderful return to home theaters with this Blu-ray release. For me, receiving this as a holiday present from my brother for our new PS3 was quite wonderful and powerfully nostalgic, as I came of age around the time of the film's 1998 release and was a huge fan of the franchise. I can remember vividly driving around town listening to my tape of the FTF sound-track in my first car, memories brought back to me by hearing the sound-track on the disc. Seeing and hearing the movie again in pristine, high definition form has been a very enjoyable experience.

The movie looks and sounds great, as one would expect from a featured Blu-ray title. You can choose between the Extended Cut and the Theatrical Version. There are a few extra scenes in the Extended Cut as well as the option to watch the new commentary in PiP mode. The disc has a range of special features, many of which I have yet to explore. Among them are a new commentary from the film's creators, the original commentary from 1999, the ""Making Of"" special commentary on the effects and sound, an alternate take of the bee-sting scene, a gag reel, concept art and the complete story-board. All of these features are well done and worth watching, at least for fans of the franchise; I feel like I now know so much more of the inside story of the film's development. Through watching the film again in this format and viewing the special features, one gains extra appreciation for the film and its director, Rob Bowman. I have only started watching the first part of the new commentary session with PiP mode, so there's a lot more waiting for me on the disc.

The Amazon.com Editorial shown on this page really doesn't do FTF justice. It was a great, and in my opinion, underrated feature film adaptation of a wonderful television series. I personally think FTF was just about the best possible film that could have been made from Chris Carter's television creation. It successfully brought the show to proper feature film scale, and it moved the show's mythology along quite a bit without immersing the larger film audience in the show's lore to too great an extent. And while the franchise as a whole was degraded by the low-quality, Mulder-less last seasons as well as a low-budget follow-up 2008 film, IWTB, FTF itself is not tarnished in my mind by those subsequent franchise developments. FTF on Blu-ray will be a welcome purchase or gift for any mildly serious X-Files fan. It has definitely rekindled a lot of the passion I had for the film and the series. Now all I need is Seasons 1-5 (and perhaps 6) on Blu-ray, which I imagine will come out eventually.",1230336000,7,2664,4.641949152542373

THX won't even respond as well.

Specifically, this movie sees the deaths of two important characters from the serial (not Fox or Scully of course), and the existence of aliens on earth is confirmed once and for all in the movie's climatic ending.  The style and substance of the movie mirrors the TV show; no sex, swearing or blood, and one short scene of near romance.  Hence both movie and serial are appropriate for the same audiences.

750703,1,6303972969,"You might want to pull up a chair, this is a long, self-interested review.

Back in the autumn '07 I saw this p'ticular movie in a bargain bin, on sale for a dollar, and although I still remembered my loathing for the way its makers manipulated so many of us into flocking to our local multiplex, only to rip us off our ticket price, I still bought it on a ""wonder if it was really that bad?"" basis. And now that I've at last made time to see it, guess what...it's still THAT BAD.

To think, back in the late-`90's I spent months looking forward to this film. There was once a time, after all, when The X-Files was a big deal, and when I was in college, it was the one TV show no one ever seemed to miss. Instead of a project equal to my and so many others' eager  anticipation, we were ""treated"" to a movie that was terrible in every way. Filled with clichs (please, why must every on-screen bomb have those little red numbers on the front counting down the time till detonation?), this movie made an even greater muddle of already muddled conspiracy theories that by then were starting to drag down one of the most suspenseful, intelligent, and altogether cool series in broadcast history.

Although Fight The Future (yes the ""X-Files Movie"" actually had a name) promised to reveal all or at least much that we'd been squirming to know, this stinko actually backfired and showed that not only was the truth not out there, but The X-Files was actually a ship plowing haphazardly through choppy waters, no one at the wheel.

As we left the theater, my friend said to me, ""They're just making this stuff up as they go, aren't they?""

""Yep, Jackie,"" I replied, ""they are.""  (There, I used your name in a review.)

And for the first time, ladies and gentlemen, the light of Heaven shone down onto New England, and we saw the Emperor was stark naked.

Okay, kidding aside, I truly think the release of this film was when The X Files jumped the sharks and the beginning of the end to this once ice-hot TV show can be traced to this one goshawful motion picture.

Why after so long do I still feel so much antipathy for a banal movie? Because it was bad. Yes, truly bad as a stand-alone work, and much worse as a disgrace to the one-time great series. Just absolutely hideous!",1204329600,8,2270,4.39618138424821

750738,1,6303972969,"The last two seasons of The X-Files are nothing short of heartbreaking, cowardly, traitorous, and completely myopic in my opinion, and I'm quite sure in the opinions of many others who were loyal fans of this series for 9 long years. In an attempt to make an extra buck, Chris Carter and his corporate goonba accomplices sacrificed content and continuity for series longevity, and in the end succeeded in tarnishing a one-of-a-kind program.

I would love to know what kind of rationale was in play when those in charge decided to kill off some of the most important characters, thereby severing story lines, plots, and important character interdependencies that had been cultivated from the beginning. The Lone Gunmen, C.G.B. Spender (Cigarette Smoking Man), Krycek, and The Syndicate (to name a few) formed an impossible-to-replace group of characters, and I lost all respect for the show when these characters were eliminated and nothing of substance was created to take their place.

Carter should have called it quits when Duchovny left, but no. What we have instead are two additional seasons that are total monstrosities and an insult to viewers who placed emotional stock in this show and its characters. Carter obviously had zero loyalty to the program's fans, otherwise he would never have made such a callous decision to ruin this show's legacy by tampering so radically with the storyline. What was left after the deed was done? Absolutely nothing.

The series finale was perhaps the biggest disappointment in programming history. From the very first episode, the series revolved around an extraterrestrial storyline, and what did we get at the end and in return for all of our years of loyal viewing? We get Mulder and Scully sitting in a hotel room, reminiscing about old times, not knowing where to go or what to do next. And to top it all off, Carter always promised he would never entangle Mulder and Scully in any type of sexual intrigue, and what did he do during the last two seasons? You guessed it.

It's been a long time since this series went off the air, but the greed and selfishness surrounding the production of the last two seasons, and in particular the last season, still resonates because this series did mean alot to so many people, myself included. Chris Carter is set for life, but he has lost my respect. He and his retinue's opportunism makes me sick....",1199491200,9,2390,4.893827160493827

750742,4,6303972969,"We were buying the series piecemeal as it was released, but we stopped when the thin packs started as we were overseas at the time.  As one reviewer noted:

""I bought seasons 1 - 9 on DVD. Thus far season 1 and 2 have annoying flashes between scenes. Season 1 has it on even DVD disks and Season 2 has it on odd DVD disks. Edits of scenes appear to randomly splice 2 even or 2 odd fields into 1 frame. The result is overlapping fields in frames between scenes and loss of synchronization. Horizontal tearing is very evident. This causes flashes of light between scenes that is especially annoying when going from a light scene to a dark scene or vice versa. It does not appear to be a bad press of the DVD.""

That happened with the original disks not when we first watched them, but when we re-watched them on our admittedly very old plasma.  The encoding process sends a bad signal that makes the older HD tvs flip out during certain scene cuts.  If you are one of the people who own a Philips plasma circa 2002-2003, you will most likely notice the problem regardless of the DVD player.  Our newer, smaller, LCD tv does not exhibit the same problem, even with the same player.

I thought long and hard about spending 600 dollars on the whole set since we already owned seasons 1-4, but since I'd already spent at least 100 dollars a season at that point, it was worth it to me to spend 60 dollars a season plus another 100 in order to get the whole collection.  My local Best Buy still wants 90 dollars for a season, and they don't carry the older DVDs.

If you've never seen the X files, or if you are a fan and want a complete collection, this is an expensive option.  It's not unreasonable, however.  If you give it time, the price may come down.  I spent just $120.00 for all of Andromeda, and I'd never seen an episode.

Like most non-fans, I just didn't have the patience for it. The show would hint at a lot, but it seemed very little would actually happen, and instead each show would just tease us a little more.

The reason I decided to watch the movie was because I thought that the movie would probably be designed for a wider audience, have a self-contained story, and lots more excitement and special effects than the TV show.

Well, kind of. There were more explosions and the special effects were a bit more snazzy. And it was very easy to jump right into it and pick up the story without much knowledge of the TV show. But, in typical X-files fashion, it teased a lot more than it delivered, and the ending was very unsatisfying.

To be fair, I realize this was intentional on the film maker's part. And in the director's commentary, the director repeatedly bragged about leaving things vague in order to make them scarier to the imagination. But, is it just me, or does anyone else think the X-files were never all that scary to begin with?",1179964800,,1104,4.4504950495049505

750812,5,6303972969,"Update: This may be obvious, but just in case: We watched these DVDs again with today's HD Player and TV. The DVDs play fine now. The old NTSC odd/even field information is probably discarded in the transcoding to progressive scan HD. Thus the problem is eliminated as described in my original review below.

I bought seasons 1 - 9 on DVD. Thus far season 1 and 2 have annoying flashes between scenes. Season 1 has it on even DVD disks and Season 2 has it on odd DVD disks. Edits of scenes appear to randomly splice 2 even or 2 odd fields into 1 frame. The result is overlapping fields in frames between scenes and loss of synchronization. Horizontal tearing is very evident. This causes flashes of light between scenes that is especially annoying when going from a light scene to a dark scene or vice versa. It does not appear to be a bad press of the DVD.

When they accidentally cut the scene correctly, 50 % of the time, there is no annoying flash. The problem doesn't last very long, but ruins the moment for sure in some scenes.

Some scenes also suffer from jitter problems. I think the DVD player is not at fault on this. The problem seems to be on the DVD. Perhaps it has to do with the bitrate of the mpeg file.

Anyway, you may want to rent before you buy to check this out. I hope the problem is gone by season 3.",1175644800,6,1325,4.266932270916334
750813,5,6303972969,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. The is the only X-Files to be in 5:1 Dolby Digital since the show was presented in 2:1 surround, not remastered to 5:1 for the Box Set releases.

The X-Files: the movie, follows in the steps of Season Five and prepares us for Season Six although you don't have to see the Seasons in order to know what is going on as the movie can stand alone by itself (something which causes it to loose a little bit of what fan's prefer in exchange for slight alterations in tone and story for the movie-going masses). Season five ended with the X Files basement being burned down after the return of the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) from the grave. Mulder once believed that the hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth was a con to detract from what is simply a series of government experiments on the citizens of planet Earth and the alien agenda just subterfuge. Scully however was absolutely convinced that Mulder was right all long and so took the lead role as the paranormal investigator while Mulder turned sceptic. This character switch now only needs Mulder to come around to what he originally believed, in order for both Mulder and Scully to be on the same wavelength for the first time. The X-Files is all about coming to that point and then some more.

Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) make an appearance. Terry O'Quinn from the Millennium television series has a brief role as FBI agent Darius Michaud however the new characters are mainly veteran Hollywood actors brought in to vamp things up to movie quality. Martin Landau plays the paranoid Alvin Kurtzweil, MD set to expose the secret government. Armin Mueller-Stahl is Conrad Strughold, the new face of the mysterious ""the Group"", a sort of dark Einstein that has a few things to say about the fact that he has been forced to reassess his role by new effects in biology which have presented themselves as spontaneous population. The central most important character of the lot for this film is The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") who is about to tell Mulder what the conspiracy is. The car scene in which this is revealed is nearly everything the fans have been waiting to hear although some points are left relatively obscure (so that we can have more Seasons about it). It is for this that most X-File lovers will be satiated and left spinning thinking about the ramifications of the new deadly threat. While not everything in the movie might not make movie quality sense (we have always ignored the holes to allow for quicker moving themes in the stories in the television series and the same applies here) and sometimes characters do or act in a very odd way along with lots of borrowing from movies we have seen before, the action midway possibly more than a little bit underachieving, many would have hoped for more, but alas this is just a big two hour episode with extra special effects and not the kind of movie-movie that maybe some expected. It is really a big play up to the delivery of the conspiracy in the car scene. Keep expectations low and the rewards are much higher. Hope to see Star Wars EP. III and you will be far from impressed. Critic weighing-scales aside the main reason to see this movie is that we could be seeing Mulder and Skully getting it on!... now why didn't I mention that earlier? If you just a regular movie goers outside of the fan base you can knock a star of this review. For those who gave it 5, it is on to Season 6 from here...",1173484800,,5461,4.705329153605016

750815,5,6303972969,"What a great movie. I am a seriously fanatical fan of the X-Files, so my opinions regarding this movie are totally biased. The film starts in Texas during the last ice-age, with a couple of neanderthals tracking a creature into an ice-cave. They catch up to it and a rather unpleasant fight ensues. Offcourse, this creature is no earthly type but very alien (basically, he is E.T. gone horribly wrong). One of the neaderthals is killed, the other succeeds in killing the creature, only to succumb to an invasion by a black-oily substance entering his blood stream. The next scene takes place at the same location in the present. A child falls through a hole into the dried out remians of the very same cave and lo and behold, is taken over by the same black oily substance. And so the tale begins in what becomes Mulder and Scully's biggest adventure yet.

For the X-File fan, my question is this: what the hell are you doing reading this? You should've already seen this movie. Purchase this movie at once or don't consider yourself and X-Files fan anymore. For the rest of you - this movie is prehaps the best introdution into the world of the X-Files. The movie, in terms of the overall mythology of the X-Files series comes at the end of the 5th season and ties in very nicely with the opening of the 6th season. Certainly there are a some concepts and story plots that will initially be hard to grasp for the novice X-Filer, however there is no reason why such a person will not thoroughly enjoy this movie, especially if you are at all interested in Sci-Fi and adventure. You'll get to meet all the principal characters of the X-Files and learn some of the pertinent concepts behind the X-Files mythology.

As a movie in itself, it is extremely well made. Superb cinematography, exceptionlly well edited and a well thought out script. The score used throuhgout the movie was ideal and used in a professional manner - i.e it never drowned out the movie, only complimented the scenes, as a sound track should do. I suppose if I were a true critic with no interest in the X-Files, I mightn't give five stars, mabey more like four stars. The film wasn't completely Acadamy award winning stuff, though not far short, particularly in terms of the special effects - brilliant stuff.

I've seen both versions displayed on the big screen and take it from me, it's somehow just not the same. And the Asian versions.... forget it!! If you're at all serious about this show, a hacked off, ripped off bangkok bootleg version is not even a serious option to consider!

Other than that, I will add that you can purchase the original collector's versions cheaper still than on Amazon. $550 for the series (equating to about $60 a season) is a little steep. I payed exactly half that when Best Buy had a ""buy 3, save $30 special."" However at this point, the original boxed versions are next to impossible to still find in stores and your only choice may just be Ebay where they ARE almost $60 (some more) per season!

Scully gets bit by one and Mulder has to find the cure before it's too late and an alien pops out of her chest.

  I know that aliens popping out of peoples chest is hardly original but this is still an entertaining movie. Plus it's better than all the crap David Duchovny has been making of late. Another movie has always has had a lot of potential and sooner or later another one might actually be made. I'd love to see Duchovny back because playing Mulder is certainly what he does best.

750874,2,6303972969,"I gave up watching cable TV in the early 90s, so I missed most of the X-Files in their original incarnation. I've always had a soft spot (my fontanel, most likely) for the paranormal, though, so the show's premise always intrigued me. So when I saw the VHS of what I thought were episodes of the TV show for $1 at the Goodwill, I splurged.

Alas, it turns out that I bought the X-Files movie made in 1998. As someone who did not watch the show, I cannot comment on how the movie fits into the whole X-Files universe; I am stuck commenting on it solely as a movie in the SF and/or horror genres.

Some aspects of the film were good. Mulder and Scully were great together, and I am sure that the complementarity of their characters (as a paranormal ""Odd Couple"" of sorts) was one of the reasons the TV show was so successful. Casting Academy Award-winner Martin Landau as the conspiracy writer and ""kook"" Kurzweil was an inspired choice, given his ability to convey grave sentiments while still being somehow light-handed about it.

Overall the film was disappointing, though. Again, maybe it is because I did not follow the TV series, but the plot here seemed simultaneously slapdash and derivative. When I say that  it was slapdash, I refer to its significant continuity and plot problems. Why was there an Oklahoma City-like bombing to get at five infected corpses? How in the heck did Mulder make it from the US out into the heart of an Antarctic icefield in 48 hours? How did he and Scully make it home from Antarctica? Where did Scully get the footwear in Antarctica (she has bare feet in one scene, and is walking on Antarctic ice in the next)? These are just a few examples of the badly thought-out plot that afflicts this film.

Even this would forgivable if so much in the movie were not painfully derivative. Extraterrestrials gestating inside human beings and bursting out when they mature definitely sounds familiar. I forget where I saw it before, but the movie had something to do with aliens, I think. The Landau character, while played brilliantly, is far too similar to Donald Sutherland's character in JFK; he knows everything, but how? He is always stalking in the shadows where Mulder can find him while eluding the rest of the nation's intelligence community? Come on. Sadly, if the truth really is out there, the screenwriters probably cribbed it from an earlier film.

As for the movie itself, it's alright, but it's a very Hollywood version of The X-Files. It doesn't hold up to the better episodes of the earlier seasons - they're the real X-Files, and very cinematic.",1145750400,,381,4.366197183098592
750977,5,6303972969,"My very first episode of the show I saw was Avatar, a season 3 episode involving a character named Skinner. But I didn't catch the bug until season 4's ""Unruhe"" starring Pruitt ""buggy eyes"" Taylor Vince. Then me and my mom got heavily into it so the film is of course a big thing. While the show does provide some answers, it also in typical X-Files fashion presents a whole new host of them. Newbies will most likely be confused while X-Philes will love it completely or like it but have issues.

Taking place between season 5 finale ""The End"" which saw The X-Files office being turned crispy by a fire and season 6 premiere ""The Beginning"", the film starts with a bombing in Dallas for which Mulder and Scully are blamed. Their investigation leads them to finding a huge corn crop in Texas with friendly bees and travelling to the land beside the land down under: Antarctica.

One goal the filmmakers set was that you would get the story elements if you were a fan but if you weren't, the film would try to recap in a sense. So while longtime fans will remember Scully's leaving behind a career in medicine, we know that already, we actually smile as we see Mulder's sunflower seeds habit continuing. Certain characters return, others oddly are absent and one character's fate is surprising for longtime fans.

Highlights are probably a little action scene involving corn crops and a really cool end scene where it takes place in Antarctica. This one shot in particular where um, ""something"" makes it first appearance outside is so cool I actually pressed my Instant Replay to see it again. For certain people it might get boring or slow in parts but most people won't even notice, such as me.

Probably one of the biggest sexual tension filled relationship is Mulder and Scully. It of course helps both are good looking(being a guy I obviously gravitate towards Gillian Anderson) but it proves that casting wouldn't be a problem in the film. Even some new faces appear including Martin Landau, Blythe Danner(Gwyneth's mom FYI), Terry O'Quinn(Locke from Lost) and Armin Muehller-Stall.

It's a film that definately needs a double-dip(odd I actually want that), the film's fairly bare bones, including a short EPK and a commentary(informative, but still that's it). X-Files fans will certainly get something out of it but for non-fans, it helps if you read up on the show using episode guides or watch the show otherwise you'll probably be slightly lost.",1145491200,2,2455,4.794326241134752

750983,4,6303972969,"""The X-Files:  Fight The Future"" is the first attempt at transferring Mulder and Scully to the big screen.  Though I enjoyed the original series, I was never a fanatic about it.  In fact, when this film originally came out, I had no intentions of seeing it.  Now that I finally have, I must admit that it is pretty good.  It's full of cameos and tie-ins from the TV series that even a casual fan such as myself can pick up on, but you need not watch any of the series' episodes to enjoy this film.

This movie really plays out like an extended TV episode with just tad better special effects.  But, much like the series, this movie relies on the strength of the plot to peak the interest of the viewer.

As in the series, there is a giant government cover-up going on.  Fox and Scully are hot on the trail(as usual), and break a few rules along the way in order to gather information.  There are leaks, men in black, men in HAZMAT suits, and unexplained, strange events.  I can't say much more than that or I'll spoil the show.  Just know that little green men are on the move and Fox and Scully are trying to stop them.

The acting is superb, and the banter between Mulder and Scully is tight and witty as it ever was on the TV show.  David Duchovny is comfortable in his role as the quirky, paranoid, and probably a little bit crazy Mulder.  Gillian Anderson, whom I consider business-suit beautiful, gives another flawless performance as Scully.  Martin Landau also makes an appearance as well as an abundance of recurring characters from the TV show.

Odds are that if you enjoyed the series, you'll enjoy this film.  It does begin to drag a bit about 110 minutes into the flick, but the ending picks things up and gets somewhat suspenseful.  If you aren't familiar with the show, rest assured that you won't be anymore lost during the film than TV regulars and the characters in the movie.

Recommended to those who like sci-fi with a little bit of brains thrown in and anyone who loves a good mystery.

Potential Spoiler!!!!

This film becomes rather timely with the mention of a certain government group that appears to be the major catalyst for most of the conspiracy in this film.  If you have heard of those two hurricanes that recently whipped up on the Gulf coast from Alabama to Texas(including my home of southwest Louisiana), you know which government group I'm talking about........",1138233600,3,2398,4.538461538461538

Far too often movies based on TV shows, that actually have the same characters and similar plots, end up being misguided and well, weak.  However, this film was a strong one, and I believe it guided the viewer to a new level of X-files that many fans at that point had probably been long in the waiting to see.

And I'm not just talking about the Mulder/Scully relationship developing either, although the film touches on that to a degree.  I just mean the X-files story as a whole.  And sure, maybe the movie's plot could have been even a bit stronger, but it touched on loose ends from the series while giving new life to the characters, an accomplishment on it's own I'd say.

So if you're a new fan, because I know all you old ones have seen it, then take a look.  Of course, if you've never watched a show you won't be left out either, so take a look at the film if you will, because I think you'll enjoy it.",1136937600,,1191,4.103448275862069

Considering the amount of money that was obviously invested in this project wouldn't you think that they could have made the effort to come up with a decent script? Think again!

1. Why did the Arctic facility implode when Scully got injected with the serum? No reason that I can tell other than they had to draw this hokum to a close somehow.

And 2. How did the pair get out of the Arctic alive? They were both wet through, Muldar had no coat and Scully had wet socks and no boots so they can hardly have walked out of there - and where did Scully's trousers come from anyway?!

751055,4,6303972969,"This repackaging of THE X FILES according to the mythology arc has, no doubt, long been expected by most diehard fans of the now legendary television series. Having received the 4 volumes as a Christmas gift, this grateful recipient has not had time to peruse all 60 episodes + extras; however, a few observations do come to mind.

RE: THE X FILE MYTHOLOGY, VOL 1-4 (""Abduction""; ""Black Oil""; ""Colonization""; ""Super Soldier""):

Recommendations, divided into 4 categories of prospective buyers, are as follows:

1) FANATICS/COLLECTORS:

True fanatics or obsessive collectors will, irrespective of whether they own all 9 complete seasons, want to add these 4 volumes to their shelves.  That there exists only a small amount of new material ( in terms of extras: audio commentary + documentary ) is really irrelevant to those who fall into this category. 5 STARS in terms of its appeal for this group of people.

2) ""REGULAR"" FANS:

""X-Philes"" who exist on a lesser ( if saner ) plane of dedication may want to consider whether, possessing some ( if not, perhaps, all ) of the complete DVD sets, these repackaged sets actually add to their enjoyment. It seems indisputable that THE X FILES will never be understood on an aesthetic level by solely watching the myth arc episodes; therefore, it begs the question of why one would purchase the ""complete"" myth arc when it's possible to go the way the series did when it originally aired- i.e., by alternating between mythology and stand alone episodes. 2 STARS in terms of its appeal for this group of people.

3) CONFUSED BUT INTERESTED VIEWERS:

People with some familiarity with the show but who never quite watched with enough regularity ( or intensity ) to follow the intricacies of the mythology arc, may well consider purchasing these volumes. Presumably, those who fall ( more or less ) into this category will not have purchased the complete DVD seasons ( or at least not *all* of them ). It may well be financially (1/5 cost of 9 complete seasons) and aesthetically satisfying to purchase these 4 repackaged volumes and supplement ( by renting or borrowing ) selected stand alone ( ""monster of the week"" ) episodes. 4 STARS in terms of its appeal for this group of people.

4) NOVICES

For those who truly haven't watched THE X FILES, or at most, a few episodes, it seems a toss-up as to whether these sets are the right way to go. It is this reviewers suggestion that those in this category rent some episodes; specifically, the first 4 episodes of SEASON ONE (Pilot, Deep Throat, Squeeze, Conduit ) in order to establish whether they find the show appealing. If they're hooked, and have  the willingness to invest money through purchasing DVD's outright, it might be better to start purchasing all nine complete seasons over time ( most definitely *in order* ). The other option for beginners would be to purchase the 4 repackaged myth arc volumes ( again, paying attention to proper order ) and renting select stand alone episodes ( there are numerous books and websites which can guide one to the very best episodes ). 3 STARS in terms of its appeal for this group of people.

NOTE: The X FILES MOVIE ( ""Fight the Future"" ) is *not* included in this repackaging release. After viewing the first 3 episodes of Vol 3: ""Colonization"" (Patient X, The Red and the Black, The End), it is extremely advisable, for the sake of continuity and understanding, to buy ( or at least, watch ) the film *before* continuing with the remaining (Vol 3) episodes.

RE: THE X FILES MYTHOLOGY, VOL 1: ""Abduction"":

Of the 15 episodes selected ( which span Season 1 thru start of Season 3), it seems to this reviewer debatable whether Season 2 episode titled ""Red Museum"" should have been included when Season 1 ""Conduit"" was not. Furthermore, if the latter episode was not deemed (for whatever reason) to be up to standard, Season 2 ""Sleepless"" would have had the virtue of introducing a key character (Alex Krycek), with the episode plot having at least as much pertinence to the myth arc as the comparatively inferior ""Red Museum"". Just two cents from a faithful X-Phile.

IMPORTANT: for those who are new to THE X FILES, the documentary  (""Threads of Mythology"" ) for Volume 1 contains an unfortunate (completely inappropriate) spoiler. Without elaborating, I can only implore beginners ( few as they may be ) to stay away from this documentary until after finishing either Complete Season 7 or Volume 3 (""Colonization"")

CONCLUSION:

With regard to THE X FILES myth arc as a totality; those looking for airtight plot development and perfectly logically explanations as the storyline developed over the course of nine grueling seasons, are truly barking up the wrong tree. Chris Carter and his collaborators, while having a vague idea of where the specifics of the storyline could go, never had every detail planned out, and thank goodness for that! If 1013 Productions had applied such a misguided notion of continuity, many of the surprising twists and turns that characterized the myth arc would have never materialized.",1136246400,44,5063,4.852668213457076
751056,3,6303972969,"Add me to the list of disgruntled fans who have loyally bought the full season sets, which are expensive, and then are asked to shell out more for extra features.

751057,4,6303972969,"The X-Files is my absolute favorite televison show. In fact I bought my first DVD player just so I could buy the DVD sets and watch all the episodes in order. The stand alone episodes are good, but the mythology episodes are why I collected them in the first place.

  However, I came across one small ""issue"" when I saw the list of episodes on the Abduction set. It's missing the episode called ""Sleepless"". While this episode's main plot is NOT part of the mythology it does contain two or three EXTREMELY important scenes pertaining to the mythology. This is the episode that introduces two major mythology characters: Krycek and X. It has a wonderful scene where we meet X for the first time and it establishes Krycek's connection with the CSM (although this becomes easily apperent in Ascension). But think about it. If you are watching the episodes as they are presented in this set, the first time X appears is in Ascension when Mulder goes to Senator Matheson's office for help. People who haven't seen Sleepless will be wondering ""Who the heck is this guy? Did I miss something?"" And of course the answer is, ""Yes. You did miss something"". At the very least I think that those scenes should have been worked into the set, maybe as optional bonus footage that could be viewed in the Duane Barry menu.

  For those of you who are new to the mythology and are interested in buying the four sets you should know that ""Sleepless"" should be viewed between ""Little Green Men"" and ""Duane Barry"".

  I WAS pleased to note that they corrected the credit tag on Ascension to ""Deny Everything"" which was not on the original season two box set (at least not on mine anyway).",1132876800,8,1670,4.595959595959596
751058,5,6303972969,"The X-Files is my favorite all-time TV series (though, I must admit, it is tied with Seinfeld and the Simpsons).  I would always look forward to seeing it, whether a rerun or a new show.  Though I missed many, many, many episodes during its 9 year life (I was never really one to be glued to the TV for any show), I have been frustrated in my efforts to watch episodes I have missed, mostly due to the expense of the Complete Season DVD sets.  It is once in a blue moon that I can afford to put down as much as $120 for a TV show, so I've done without for a long time, barring my ownership of Season 3.  Also, I've found that the episodes I care the most about catching up on are the ones that push the main story line along-- the ones dealing with the government-conspiracy-alien-takeover story line; something I've since learned is referred to as ""the Mythology arc.""  This will sound lame (even to this writer) but the Bare Naked Ladies song ""One Week"" summarized my hopes when sitting down to watch the X-Files.  ""I hope the Smoking Man is in this one.""  The smoking man's involvement in an episode usually indicated a furthering of the overall plot, the mythology arc.  In short, these are the Smoking Man episodes.

Seasons 1-3 are the show in its prime.  Most X-heads agree with this, and it's tough to argue, considering the show's originality in its genesis.  The arc moves especially fast in season 1, where Mulder's knowledge of the paranormal seems to be based on research and over 22 episodes he becomes emersed in it.  The acting is a bit shotty in those beginning episodes.  Hindsight gives us the advantage of comparing the newbies with the developed Skully and Mulder characters.  But that is little to argue, since the entire show was always about the story.  And, of course, this DVD set focuses on the BIG story of those early seasons.  Yes, a few of the details are missed, but I can't see a casual fan putting down the amount of money it takes to get all the episodes of any season, where only about 4 or 5 episodes deal with the mythology arc.  This series of the show trims the fat, leaving you with the first installment of a 60 episode complex, detailed, thrilling story.  A 60 hour movie minus the commercials.

The best part is I had the idea to do this for myself, years down the line after I had collected all 9 seasons.  I was going to burn all the mythology episodes onto a few DVDs so I could watch them continuously.  Well needless to say, I'm thrilled someone else has done it for me.

Finally, there is great value in this series.  A single entire season of the show consists of 22 - 24 episodes (including TBCs) on 7 DVDs for $90 - $120, depending on the place you buy it.  The Mythology series offers 15 - 16 episodes per Volume (4 Volumes, 60 episodes total) on 4 DVDs per Volume (16 DVDs total) for $30 each ($120 total).  That's 60 episodes versus 24 episodes for the exact same price.  I'm glad I waited.

Oh, and for the completists complaining that Fox is putting this series out-- of course they're trying to make money.  Why do you think they put the show on TV in the first place?  No one is MAKING you buy these Volumes.  That's your choice.  If you choose to become a completist, that's the price you pay.  This is a great idea, for a great show, for a great value.  5 stars all around!

751059,3,6303972969,"The X-Files is my all time favorite television show.  I remember waiting with baited breath for each new episode in the paranoid world of Mulder and Scully.  After the show went off the air, i've had a hard time scraping enough cash together to get even one season, let alone all nine that I really wanted.  Luckily Fox is reissuing the frist three seasons at around $40.00 dollars on January 31st, but in the mean time i've gotten my fix from these collections of the anthology episodes.

Overall this is a good collection of some great episodes.  Abduction collects episodes spanning the first four seasons of the show and the abduction theme that dominated most of the story.  Some highlights include my all time favorite episode Fallen Angel, as well as classic episodes like Duane Berry and Paper Clip.

The problem with the piece meal presentation of the show however is that some gaps develop in the storyline.  This is fine for longtime fans of the show like myself who have a working knowlege of the character and their interactions, but people new to the show will have a hard time figuring out characters like Mr. X, Krychek and Skinner who seem to pop up out of nowhere on this collection.  If you've never watched the show, just seeing these episodes would have you believe that Mulder and Scully's relationship develops rather quickly.

I would much rather watch these episodes in context with the rest of the series, but until the new DVD's come out, then I guess this will have to do.  This is recommended for fans who are strapped for cash and can't afford the $120 dollar complete season DVD's.  Casual fans will love this collection because it trims the fat from the storyline that developed around these episodes.  If you've never watched the show, then catch a few early episodes on TNT or Sci-Fi and get the gist of what is going on before buying this collection",1129593600,,1884,4.672727272727273
751060,5,6303972969,"This X-Files VHS contains two episodes, both with original airdates in 1993.  I like the VHS because it contains commentary by X-Files creator Chris Carter.  The commentary airs before the show, and does contain a bit of spoiler, but if you have already seen these episodes years ago on TV, watching the commentary enhances the viewing experience.

""Conduit"" - A teenage girl with a reputation for running away has disappeared from her trailer home.  Her mother has a reputation as a crackpot who believes in UFO's, so the police are not taking her story that her daughter was taken by aliens seriously.  The mother's only ally is Mulder, who is instantly reminded of his sister's disappearance twenty-one years ago.  The girl's little brother is receiving strange transmissions from the TV that might hold clues to his sister's disappearance.

This episode gives us a look into what drives Mulder to believe, even as he is haunted by his missing sister.

""Ice"" - The scarier of the two episodes.  In a nail-biter inspired by ""The Thing,"" Mulder and Scully are sent to an Arctic research station to investigate what happened when a group of geophysicists mysteriously spiraled out of control psychologically.  Three scientists accompany the agents.

All of those things are indeed quite fantastic, and this is supposed to be science fiction, but with a good and willing imagination you can still immerse yourself in the X Files universe and be fully engrossed in the story.

But now, due to recent history, much of the impact of Kurtzweil's revelations are now no longer suspenseful, as it has been proven to be so ludicrous that its unbelievability overshadows the rest of the picture.

That is, due to the events of the past week or two on the US Gulf Coast, I find it impossible to take the concept of FEMA as a well-run agency deeply involved with a high level alien/governmental cover-up that is poised to take over the country, with any degree of seriousness.  It is apparent that FEMA would have difficulty running a hot dog cart, let alone step in as the government.

""I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country.

751120,2,6303972969,"In this extended episode of the X-Files, Scully and Mulder are re-assigned to an anti-terrorism task-force of the FBI. (The FBI has ended Fox Mulder's mission to uncover evidence of a massive conspiracy of aliens and humans to do something incredibly severe to mankind; now that they're no longer scoping for little green men, the least the bureaus can expect is to get a little descent work out of them.) The flick reunites us with Scully and Mulder during an horrific Oklahoma City style bombing - but not before a prolog set during the ice age in which antediluvian men battle a feral looking alien. Back to modern times - when the bombing begins to look less like an act of terrorism than another act of cover-up for the UFO-conspiracy, Mulder and Scully spring to action.

Actually, how many episodes of the show does that brief synopsis describe? This movie takes advantage of being a feature release (Mulder gets to curse; the special effects look better, including the mammoth explosion that kicks off the flick; the characters joke with each other as they haven't on the show - Mulder's ""panic face"" being a prime example) but never excels enough past the show that spawned it. While the show tended to offer cinematic quality in characters, scripting and direction, the flick itself looks like something off-the-shelf - they took an episode and stretched it out past an hour. Instead of making a more interesting and compelling film, the script just throws in a bigger and heavier version of the ""X-Files"" we've grown to love). Rather than stake new ground that could appeal to fans and newbies alike, the story simply brings us back to our favorite principals of the UFO Conspiracy (led by ""Cigarette""; John Neville also returns) Armin Mueller appears to give the film's best line, when he reassures the other conspirators not to worry about Mulder ""One Man Cannot Fight the Future"". Despite the cinematic effort, there's little you can say about an alien movie without a particularly interesting alien - the one here turns out to be just another long-clawed, hyper-salivary beast that leaps out of the shadows. The flick also wastes some characters you know deserve the extra effort (Terry Quinn plays a veteran agent blown to hell in the first few minutes; Martin Landau plays another one of the many conspiracy theorists who offers Mulder ""the answers"", but none of the answers that can be substantiated; Blythe Danner plays a federal investigator, one of many to read one of Scully's reports which are of course unbelievable; the beloved ""Lone Gunmen"" make a surprise appearance, but a short one). The flick's biggest weakness is that it came out while the show was still on - so it couldn't do anything earth-shaking with its characters. So many conspiracies and counter-conspiracies plague both the movie and the show, that neither gets around to solving the biggest mystery of all - why did they make this movie?",1121558400,2,2930,4.895372233400402
751121,5,6303972969,"This is a non-spoilers review.

It's hard to believe over 10 years have gone by since we were first introduced to unorthodox FBI agent Fox Mulder and his brilliant, skeptical partner Dana Scully. During its prime, Chris Carter's ""X-files"" stretched its TV budget to the limit and gave its audience perhaps the most thrilling, intelligent sci-fi suspense series yet. Back in the days before ""Alias"" and ""Lost"", few TV dramas contained obvious continuity, so creator Chris Carter was required to spread his story arc out over a period of several seasons, and devote much of his time to one-shot episodes. This 4 DVD set collects 15 of the story arc episodes from the first 3 seasons of the series.

All of the stories here deal with Mulder and Scully's growing realization that there is an almost mindboggling conspiracy in place to keep ""the truth"" away from the American public. Given that the title of this collection is ""Abduction,"" it's obvious that we're dealing with aliens and UFOs. Throughout, the effects are fantastic for what was a low-budget TV show filmed in Vancouver, Canada. But the effects are secondary to the fine ensemble acting, the moody direction, and the fabulous screenwriting. Unlike most of today's dramas, it would be possible for a total newcomer to sit down and enjoy any episode of ""The X-Files"" without having to submerge himself for hours in back stories.

Of course, as the series wore on, the quality declined. The self-contained anthology-style ""monster of the week"" episodes were imitated on everything from ""Dark Angel"" to ""Smallville"" and were widely satirized. Don't judge this DVD set by the X-files' eventual decline! Anyone who bemoans dumbed-down Hollywood sci-fi needs to check these DVDs out, to see exactly what can be done with talent, technique, and a lot of care.

751166,4,6303972969,"I'm sure you're thinking ""now that the series has been completely milked for each season, it makes sense for Fox to put out these theme driven sets."" Yes, it does.  For those fans that were big on the mythology episodes and tolerated all the other ones between them, this is the perfect set to own. It also makes ""The X-Files"" more affordable with 15 episodes running the span of the series. The mythology story arc focused on the fact that extraterrestrial aliens have been among us since the beginning of time. Let's be honest about ""The X-Files""; like any show it had its share of clunkers. Most of the mythology episodes were highlights of the series. These episodes were built initially around Mulder's sister who was, he believes, abducted by aliens. His search pushes him forward into a dark, mysterious world where it turns out that aliens are the dominating force in every government throughout the world. It seems that they have plans to colonize Earth. Why and how is what Mulder and his FBI partner Scully must discover.

With sixteen episodes spread over the set, the image quality is exceptionally good throughout. It appears as if these are the same transfers that Fox used for the entire series when it first brought them out on DVD. While they've been tweaked a bit here and there they do also suffer many of the same flaws including halos, edge enhancement and other digital issues. The 2.0 soundtrack is crisp and clear with nice reproduction of the dialog and the music by Mark Snow.

In the new 30 minute documentary Carter comments on how Gillian Anderson's real-life pregnancy impacted the storytelling arc of the series. Suddenly, Carter and his crew had to create a series of episodes built around her abduction and her unavailability for shooting. There's also a discussion on the development of the Cigarette Smoking Man throughout the series. When Bill Davis first appeared in ""The X-Files"" the writers didn't know how good an actor he was because they hadn't seen most of his work. So the episode where Mulder threatens the Cigarette Smoking Man with a gun had tension not only because of the conflict but because they weren't sure how the scenes would truly play out. ""Colony"" and ""Endgame"" are two of the most popular episodes due to the creativity of Carter, Frank Spotnitz (who was brought in when Carter needed help on the series in developing the mythology). The two in collaboration created much of the complex narrative. There's interviews with Brian Thompson who played the Alien Bounty Hunter gives his take on the character. ""Anasazi"" one of my least favorite of ""The X-Files"" two parters takes on new life (pardon the pun) due to some of the comments from Carter and Spotnitz. Inspired by a trip to Sedona, Arizona where he saw images that reminded him of drawings of aliens, Carter crafted the cliffhanger for season two advancing the series again. The complexity between the first season vs. the second season is like comparing learning the alphabet to reading whole sentences; both are important but one expressed sounds the other ideas.

 Featuring new commentary tracks by the directors and writers of each episode, this set is more than just a reissue or repackaging. Fox has attempted with these new commentary tracks and short documentary to provide additional value much as they did with the season boxed sets. On the other hand, it is a selling point designed to move more product among fans. For example, Director R. W. Goodwin does the commentary track for ""Anasazi"" and he provides both quite a bit of trivia about the mythology episode we're watching as well as trivia about the actual production.  We learn, for example, that the sequence where the boxcar was discovered is actually a quarry far from Arizona which Goodwin had his crew paint to match the sand in Arizona. They painted about a mile of the area. What the Indian community discovers there and what it brings to them changes that community forever but it also has an impact on the life of Agents Mulder and Scully. Carter's commentary as always is intelligent and insightful for his tracks.

 A creative show that fell on hard times by the end, ""The X-Files"" was a fresh, vital series for much of its run. The mythology episodes related to alien abduction are among the creepiest and best the series produced particularly ones like ""Duane Barry"".  In many respects the first season struck me as being only slightly better than the two 1970's TV series (and one of its inspirations) ""Project Bluebook"" and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"".. Combining that series with the dark conspiratorial tones of the post-Watergate era, these episodes are among the best in the story arcs Carter established.",1117152000,76,4710,4.870162297128589

They have New extras on it so thats really cool. What they really need to do is put all the great shipper episodes in a boxset!:) I recommend everyone to go out and buy the Mythology boxset cause if its like anything else Xfiles its gonna be hard to find and a great collectable. And its cheaper than the other boxsets that are between $90 and $125,1116028800,5,501,4.070707070707071
751169,5,6303972969,"I already own all Nine seasons of The X-Files so when I saw this product I didn't even consider purchasing it, that was until I saw the special features, six new commentaries and an all new documentary at a low enough price will probably be enough to make me buy this set. I do wonder though who, apart from die-hard fans like myself, will or should buy this set.

In theory it's a good idea. The mythology (that is the ongoing story-arc which dealt with the governments conspriacy to hide the truth about the existence of extra-tarrestrials for reasons unknown and Mulder and Scully's quest to uncover what exactly ""the truth"" is) of The X-Files is extremely complex and while it dose make perfect sense, no really it dose! and all your questions do finally get answered, it was extremely easy to get confused or get lost if you didn't follow it religiously (but then again that's exactly why this show became as popular as it did). So for fans who watched the show on and off and want to follow the mythology and understand it, this is a perfect product but I suspect alot of those fans probably already own a few season sets and probably won't be willing to pay more money for this.

Also for a new fan to even consider buying this set would be a huge mistake since you would be missing out on so many of the phenomenol stand-alone episodes, and you really won't understand just exactly what The X-Files is. Trust me you'd be much better off buying the individual season sets and enjoying all the episodes. So after that, I really don't see that many people out there who would be willing to buy this set.

The episodes in this set consist of all mythology episodes from season 1 and 2 (although there is an episode in Season 2 called ""Sleepless"" which introduces two major characters, Alex Krycek and Mr. X, which is strangley missing) and the first two episodes from season 3. There really was no mythology in season 1. ""The Pilot"", ""Deep Throat"", ""Fallen Angel"" and ""E.B.E"" are all completely self-contained and have little or no bearing, or resemblence, to the mythology that would begin with the brilliant season 1 finale, ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"". The aforementioned early season 1 episode are pretty weak and pretty forgetable. From ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" through to ""End Game"" the mythology starts to take shape and there are some phenomenol episodes, in particular ""One Breath"". It isn't until the absolutely mind-blowing three parter ""Anasazi / The Blessing Way / Paper Clip"" that we really get to see just how vast and complex the conspriacy is. After these episodes you will definetly be preording the next set which is due out August 2nd, and which marks the real pinnacle of the mythology. Every episode in that set is incredible and you will be well and truly hooked by the end.

This is an excellent purchase for casual fans who want to relive the ongoing story of The X-Files and want all the answers to all the questions you've had, and it will certainly be enough to hook new fans, but I do wonder how many people will end up buying this set.",1115856000,17,3062,4.602564102564102
751170,3,6303972969,"This set gets docked two stars because while it is reasonably priced, Fox Entertainment didn't first go about the business of lowering the extortionist pricing of the nine individual seasons.  I am infuriated by corporate greed like this, that is focused on extracting every last penny from fans.

First, along with BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and MONTY PYTHON, THE X-FILES is my all time favorite TV show, so I'm not giving a negative review here to the show itself.  I've reviewed all of the individual seasons here on Amazon, as well as the complete nine-season set.  I've given every individual season five stars, including Seasons 7 and 9, which are widely considered the weakest seasons on the show (my feeling is that while they weren't the greatest seasons in the series, they were five-star shows compared with what else was on TV).

Here is what infuriates me about this set:  we get 16 episodes that track shows dealing with alien abductions, therefore tracking one type of episode that ran throughout the series.  I have no trouble with this.  But the price for 16 episodes is very, very reasonable, while the price for the complete episodes remain outrageously expensive.

Obviously Fox Entertainment feels that compiling a new set and offering it at an affordable price somehow trumps the need to offer the regular seasons at lowered and more reasonable prices.  The only show I know of that is more absurdly priced than THE X-FILES is FARSCAPE, which lists at around 40% more than THE X-FILES.  I'm not sure why THE X-FILES lists at $99 a set, while BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, also produced by Fox Entertainment, not only lists at a lower price at $60, but has a larger margin built in so that it discounts by 25% instead of 20%.

The only thing I can conclude when I see a set like this selling for such a low price while they leave the individual seasons priced so high is that Fox Entertainment is trying to milk us.  If they really wanted to do us a favor, they would drop the list price of each individual season to around $60 and make the series affordable.

Having said all this, I will add that the idea of compiling all of the mythology episodes isn't a bad one.  As any fan of THE X-FILES knows, the series consisted of two kinds of episode:  stand alone episodes that basically dealt with the-phenomenon-of-the-week and mythology episodes..  These pretty much stood on their own, and did not advance the government conspiracy storyline.  The mythology shows detailed the story of the government conspiracy to hide the fact and nature of alien-human interaction.  The point of these shows is to collect all of the episodes that focus on the mythology.  There truly is a storyline that runs through the nine seasons, the first truly long storyline in the history of television (before that you had continuity from week to week, like HILL STREET BLUES or DALLAS, but no unified story with a beginning, middle, and end).  But you know what would be an even better idea?  Reducing the cost of the individual seasons, and let fans have their own mythology film festivals.

NOTE:  I'd like to thank the very large number of people who have E-mailed me to let me know of the recent sale of THE X-FILES at Best Buy and other less expensive outlets.  But I would like to point out that my rant concerns overpriced box sets, and while I'm grateful for sales, the basic list price remains in place.  Hopefully 20th Century Fox will do something about this at some point, but if they do, consumer outrage may play some role in this.  I strongly believe that we fans of this show and other shows need to let the DVD manufacturers know that we are not passively accepting the unacceptably overpriced sets.  I do not currently own all of the sets of THE X-FILES (though I very much hope to someday), although I've watched the entire series several times (thank you Netflix!).  When and if the list price comes down, I will complete my collection.  But not until then.",1115596800,31,3973,4.674820143884892

Great episodes, such as the Pilot episode, ""Little Green Men"", ""Duane Barry"", ""Ascension"", ""End Game"", and ""Anasazi"" are included here, but because these are episodes picked out of the various seasons, the overall mythology of the series and the impact of various season long storyarcs are lost.  Despite that, this is a deal for casual fans of the series who want to own a few episodes of the X-Files on DVD without paying nearly 100 dollars for a single season set, but for the hardcore fans who already own any or all of the first three seasons on DVD, there is no reason to pick this up whatsoever.",1115424000,9,780,4.770370370370371
751172,5,6303972969,"This DVD should please hit-and-miss X-Files fans and the rabid fans who will buy anything X-Files.

These are great episodes. As I read through the listing on Fox's website I can see one classic after another. They take you through the early phases of the ""Mythology arc"" that ran through the series. You get a good initiation to key characters (Smoking Man, Krychek, Lone Gunmen) and a deep emersion into the paranoia that fueled The X-Files experience.

Because the Mythology episodes were scattered amongst the ""Monster of the Week"" episodes, it could be hard to follow the story chain; obviously this approach addresses that challenge. However, let me warn those not familiar with this show: Those expecting all things to be made clear and flow logically will be disappointed. This is The X-Files - Trust No Storyline.

Another strong point: The price is right, especially when compared to the complete seasons (on an episode basis, you get 16 episodes for about $30; compare that to a single season  of 19-22 episodes for about $80. True, you don't appear to get the same number of extras, but still a clear price-friendly product.

So what's not to like? Well, if you're like me and already have all of the complete seasons you want (1-6), then there isn't a good reason to spend $30 on this. I don't collect for resale, and I already have all of these episodes.

Also, The X-Files was about more than just the Mythology. Personally, I loved the writing, odd sense of humor, and Mulder/Scully chemistry. You miss a lot of great stuff when you miss the other episodes. If you loved the series and can afford them, buy the complete seasons (though I only recommend seasons 1-6).

So, if you caught the show once and a while and wished you had followed the entire Mythology arc, this looks like a great deal, and I'm rating this high for you. Otherwise, I can't see the value of it, besides putting some more money in Fox's pockets.",1115078400,65,1935,4.707100591715976

Ooops.  As many reviewers have so adroitly noted, if you're not a fan of the series, you probably won't get a lot out of this film.  While expertly done, FIGHT THE FUTURE has a lot of elements that one cannot fully appreciate if one wasn't involved in the series.  And that makes me wonder, what was the point of making a movie if only fans of the series could truly appreciate it?  Why didn't they just make a two hour t.v. movie?  Obviously, they were hoping to expand their market with this big screen version, but as box office receipts proved, the film did not make the beaucoups of money the producers had hoped to.  Nor did it make movie stars out of David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson.  I will admit however that the movie is not the least bit boring, just confusing.  The performances are professional and noteworthy, the music is neat, and it moves at a very intense pace.  However, for the simple movie goer and those who did not follow the series after this movie was released, it left a lot of open territory to explore.  A well made, interesting movie, but not enough to make me run out and buy the DVDs of the series.",1108425600,,1347,4.243137254901961
751243,5,6303972969,"At the time, THE X-FILES: FACE THE FUTURE was widely regarded as a disappointment.  For one thing, it was not a film that had the potential to appeal strongly to nonfans of the series.  It absolutely did not stand alone or provide a narrative that was unconnected with the series as a whole.  In fact, it was essentially a transition piece from Season Five to Season Six of the series.  As a film, it was limited in what it was able to achieve.  But today if we view it primarily as a pivot from Season Five to Season Six (which is probably the only way that it can be seen today), it is a very satisfying expanded episode.

Season Five memorably ended with the demise of the X-Files, not merely with their being closed, but with the actual physical files being demolished in an office fire set by the Cigarette Smoking Man.  Mulder and Scully had also failed to protect Gibson, a young boy who had the capacity to read minds (and who had more or less told Mulder and Scully, ever repressed in matters of the heart, that they were in love with one another).  The movie picks up the narrative at precisely this point, with Mulder and Scully working in Texas as part of a large team working on a bomb case.  Likewise, Season Six of the series would pick up immediately following the end of the action of the movie, with Mulder and Scully being debriefed at a meeting, basically recounting the major events covered in the film.  In other words, the film is completely embedded in Seasons Five and Six of the television show.

Obviously, everyone who was part of the series had to be fitted into the film somehow.  So we get brief appearances by everyone from Skinner to the Lone Gunmen to The Well-Manicured Man (who memorably departs the series in the film) to the Cigarette Smoking Man.  But luckily despite the need and/or urge to put as much in the film as possible, the film features a lot of time with classic Mulder/Scully interaction.  They come within centimeters of logging their first kiss ever (a long, slow, deliberate almost-kiss--though their joint ability to forget such a moment becomes more than a little trying afterwards).  There are hordes of aliens that Mulder has to save Scully from, but which she conveniently misses when she passes out at key moments.  There is even a huge spaceship that rises from the Artic icebed that Scully again manages to miss at key moments (and which provides a nice comic moment in Season Eight, when a worshipping FBI agent asks them how Mulder was able to get Scully back to civilization after he had run out of gas).

After the end of THE X-FILES series, it is rumored that Chris Carter declined to make additional films so near the end of the show.  Today, however, there have been multiple rumors that all of the key figures are more amenable to reprising THE X-FILES on the silver screen.  Because the series is no longer running, and there is no story line to tie into, I actually have higher hopes for additional films than I did for the original.  David Duchovny says that the screenplay Chris Carter is working on focuses less on aliens and more on the supernatural.  It is fascinating to speculate on how a new film would go, since Mulder and Scully were not actually on the X-Files any longer at the end of the show.  On the other hand, they apparently poised to finally have that full blown romance that seemed to be percolating for seasons.  Will Mulder be back in the FBI?  Will Mulder and Scully be a couple?  Will the Cigarette Smoking Man appear (yeah, he got killed--again--but don't tell me that that is any impediment to his return)?  Have the X-Files been reopened?  Have Mulder and Scully become paranormal free agent investigators?  The series ended in such a way that the virtually anything is possible.  Regardless, I think it will be crucial for people to ignore the first film in assessing where the next one will go.  This one, while satisfying now as part of a larger story arc, was too embedded in the series to be judged apart from its role in promoting the story of the series.",1107734400,4,4060,4.5523415977961434
751244,4,6303972969,"A film by Rob Bowman

Set shortly after Season 5 of the ""X-Files"" television program, ""X-Files: Fight the Future"" is the first film (and to date, only) dealing with the ""X-Files"" characters and storylines.  This film is steeped in the mythology of the series, which means that it deals with the government conspiracy and the cover ups of aliens, and all of the deep mythology which drives the show.  The X-Files are closed and FBI Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) have been reassigned and are currently working on a called in bomb threat in a government building.  The case has the feel of the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah building, and when the bomb goes off the wreckage looks like just that.  But this is only the beginning as things quickly do not add up and Mulder is off on another chase for ""The Truth"" while Scully has to try to scientifically back up (or disprove, which she never can) Mulder's wild theories.

While the series can explore grand conspiracies and big stories on each episode, these stories tend to be revealed slowly over the course of multiple episodes and multiple seasons.  Giving the viewer an ""X-Files"" movie means that we are likely to be given a grander story all at one time, and this is exactly what we get.  This movie works on two levels.  A viewer with no experience with the ""X-Files"" can enjoy the movie on its own merits.  This is the way that I first experienced the film when it was released in the theatres in 1998.  It wasn't until years later I started watching the show on DVD and worked my way up to the movie and had a completely different experience.  For longtime fans of the show, this movie works as an extended episode (or one of the two episode story arcs).  It just operates on a larger scale than is possible on episodic television.

Viewers with no ""X-Files"" experience can watch a movie involving a government conspiracy and something do with extra-terrestrials.  Fans of the series will get explanations for the origins of the black oil, the bees, a greater look at the extent of the conspiracy (difficult to explain without spoiling it), and a very good long episode of the show.  There are explosions and danger and a trip to Antarctica with a reveal that has to be seen to be believed.  This movie rewards fan of the show, but leaves as many questions as it answers.  This particular storyline will not be resolved until midway through Season 6.

While enjoyable, I would not recommend this movie for those who are not fans of the ""X-Files"".  It works on its own, but truly rewards viewers of the series.  I would highly recommend this movie to those who already enjoy the show or are just discovering it.  But for those viewers, I would make sure that you have seen the episodes through Season 5 as this is where it fits into the chronology.  For fans of the show, this movie should just be considered a two hours episode of ""The X-Files"", and it is a good one.

-Joe Sherry",1105315200,3,2981,4.56015037593985
751245,3,6303972969,"For The X-Files aficionados, this movie is a must-see, not because of any wonderful cinematic magic but because of the coherence it adds to the complicated, spread out conspiracy theories that abound in the television series.  The feature length film acts like a bridge between season 5 and 6, with information contained in the movie used later in the series.  Although fans don't need to see the movie to understand later episodes, it adds to the enjoyment of them.

Naturally, the plot is too complicated to fully describe without giving away spoilers, so let it suffice to say that a mysterious underground discovery in North Texas and a Oklahoma City style bombing in Dallas are linked in ways that shock even Mulder (David Duchovny).  Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder are once again the FBI scapegoats who must prove their integrity to a panel of grim-faced investigators who are intent on closing down the X-files.  Many favorites make appearances -  Cigarette Smoking Man, the secret society of old white men, the Lone Gunmen, Skinner - with the addition of a new conspiracy informant played by Martin Landau.  Plot lines of alien viruses, Samantha Mulder's abduction, mysterious midnight shipments via trains, and government cover-ups dovetail in this convoluted yet strangely logical screenplay.  The worst part from a The X-Files fan is the rapid-fire exposition coming out of Scully and Mulder for those who have no background in the series.  For the uninitiated, the words come out too fast to grasp.  By far the coolest scene occurs near the end in a collapsing, snow covered terrain.

Don't waste your time or money if you have only a marginal interest in The X-Files, as the film's interest comes from its relationship to the television episodes.  If you are a fan, you should see this since, even though it's not great cinema, it adds another dimension to what you've already seen.  Four stars for The X-Files fans, two stars for the average viewer.",1099353600,28,1969,4.966463414634147
751246,3,6303972969,"""The X-Files: Fight the Future"" doesn't answer a lot of the questions that fans were waiting for from the TV series. The only difference between this movie and, say, a two or three part X-Files story arc is the size of the budget, effects and the guest stars. The writing, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to the best the series offered. Nevertheless, it's a fine theatrical episode of the series.

Thousands of years ago an alien species ruled this planet. Humanity was just an afterthought. It's clear that these aliens want to regain control of the planet and members of the government have made a pact with the devil; humanity will become a slave race to these aliens (and other things you don't want to know about if you haven't seen the movie otherwise it'll spoil plot points).

Somehow all of this is tied into two little boys that discover an ancient underground cavern. One of the boys is infected with some sort of virus as are several rescue workers. In another part of the US, Mulder and Scully are checking out terrorist threat against the US. The building that Mulder and Scully and the rest of the team believe to be the target is a decoy. Mulder and Scully accidently discover the real target. The mystery at the heart of the film is why the terrorist targeted a building that had the agency FEMA in it when there were more vital government agencies they could have hit. Also, the building was evacuated. So how come there were two victims discovered in the rubble?

All of this remains at the heart of the mystery and it does, indeed, play into the alien conspiracy story arc than began to be undcovered in season one of the series. If you're interested in ""The X-Files"" but haven't seen the entire series, this movie is still comprehensible to the average moviegoer. The ramifications of the plot, however, will be much more important if you've seen the bulk of seasons 2-6 first (season 1 just sets up the conspiracy angle and is important but not a central part of the conspiracy arc).

The picture quality is pretty good considering this came out close to the beginning of the DVD craze. It could be improved with an anamorphic widescreen transfer (higher picture quality)and with a separate disc of extras. The extras aren't bad here they're just not as indepth as they should be. My guess is that Fox plans on re-releasing this on DVD when the new X-Files movie comes out in 2006 and/or within the next year or two because they've finally got the entire series on DVD.

Well worth picking up for fans but for casual new viewers, I'd suggest starting with seasons 2-6 to fully understand the consequences of this film's plot line. Carter's script isn't his best but there are enough gems in the script to make it worthwhile for fans of the series.",1089158400,3,2771,4.635437881873727
751247,5,6303972969,"The X-Files ""Fight the Future"" takes place after the end of season five when the X-Files have been shut down. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson) are assigned to a Federal building in Dallas to locate a bomb. Unfortunately, the bomb goes off before it can be defused, and an FBI agent as well as three fireman and a boy are killed in the explosion. The FBI needs someone to blame for what happened and look to Mulder and Scully. Wanting to find out what really happened to save their careers, Mulder starts searching for clues. He soon encounters a paranoid doctor ( Martin Landau) who reveals to Mulder a conspiracy dealing with a deadly virus that could be alien in origin - and capable of destroying all life on earth. Mulder and Scully are soon forced to put their careers and lives on the line, when they are pitted against a powerful group of men known as the Syndicate, who are somehow connected with the virus and willing to kill to keep their secrets safe.
The X-Files film ""Fight the Future"" offers a very enjoyable transition from the television series to the big screen. I first saw the film, back when it was released in theaters. I had never seen a single episode from the show, and even though there were some things I did not understand, like who the Lone Gunmen were, the Syndicate's role in the overall conspiracy, etc., the film managed to entertain me. Now that the prices on the DVD sets for the show have been reduced, I was able to go back and finally watch the first five seasons. I recently watched the film again, and I really enjoyed it because I was finally able to understand all the smaller details that eluded me the first time around. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are in fine form once again as Mulder and Scully. Martin Landau was very good as well. Fans of the show will be happy with the film, because it does a very good job expanding on the overall mythology, as well as bringing in characters from the show like Assitant Director Skinner played by Mitch Pillegi, the Lone Gunmen, and the Cigarette Smoking Man played by William Davis. The special effects, action sequences, and suspense this film brings will entertain people who have never seen the show.
In my opinion, ""Fight the Future"" can be enjoyed by hardcore fans of the show, as well as a person who has never seen the show. I know this from experience because I was able to watch the film from both points of view. In fact, it was seeing the film the first time around that made me want to watch the show in the first place.

751302,5,6303972969,"Keeping in mind that the success behind the X-Files series was not only the brilliant writing, but also the cinematography and ""movie-look"" of the directing, it is little wonder that the X-files movie was just a two-hour long, big-budget episode of the t.v. show. As another reviewer pointed out: what else did we really want or expect? However, because this is the X-Files Movie, it would be wrong-minded to buy anything but the widescreen edition. As with the series, Chris Carter knows how to effectively fill a screen. And the movie is just as visually efficient. None of the edges are lost on this edition, as they are on the other VHS edition. And maybe it's me, but the sound is a little crisper too. In any event, if you're going to buy this film, this is the edition to get!",1085875200,5,783,4.560283687943262
751303,4,6303972969,"As a die-hard fan of ""X-Files"", I have always had a fondness for ""Conduit"", one of the very earliest episodes.  This is a thoughtful and somewhat melancholy story which gives some of the first background about the disappearance of Mulder's sister when they were kids, and how that event continues to play into Mulder's adult life.  This ep has some lovely ""X-Filey"" images: bikers riding in the woods at night; Kevin Morris' haunting drawing of the missing Ruby; the white wolves at the lake campsite; Mulder contemplating a snapshot of Samantha at the end.  It's also nice to see Carrie Snodgress (who, sadly, just passed away) in the lead guest role.  ""Conduit"" is a more emotional and introspective story, while ""Ice"" is more of an action/thriller.  ""Ice"" is also a good ep, but I've always thought it to be overrated in the series.  It IS derivative of ""The Thing"" - not that that's so awful (after all, ""Conduit"" samples ""Poltergeist"").  But the ""science"" of the writers' premise keeps falling into rather large plot holes, the guest characters are somewhat paint-by-numbers, the CGI effects leave something to be desired, and the identity of the ""villain"" is really not set up effectively, so to me it's just not as good an ep as it's often made out to be.  The increasing paranoia of the characters is done well though (which helps to disguise the weaknesses in the story), and director David Nutter does a terrific job with the claustrophobic location - the ep looks just great.  I would recommend this tape to someone who's unfamiliar with the show and wants to start at or near the beginning, but I think the other two tapes in Wave 1 (""Pilot""/""Deep Throat"" and ""Fallen Angel""/""Eve"") are stronger.",1082764800,2,1707,4.818493150684931

751305,4,6303972969,"For the uninitiated, Gypsy Rose Lee was a famous fan dancer that was able to strategically twirl fans about her unclothed body, never revealing anything to her ogling audiences.
In other words, she was the ultimate tease...until this movie came out.
Fans of the show flocked in droves to see a movie that didn't really answer a single ""question"" from the series. Seeing Mulder and Scully, as well as Director Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, The Well-Manicured Man, and the Lone Gunmen, do the ""movie-thing"" is a treat, although the story could've been fleshed out a bit more.  Creator Chris Carter promised a film that was a transitiion from season five to season six, but this film, while enjoyable is a definite ""dangling carrot"".
Acting wise, stars Duchovny and Anderson do no more with their film incarnations than they do on television and, perhaps, that's as it should be.  Oscar winner Martin Landau basically does the wild-eyed, seeing conspiracies around every corner quirky scientist-thing.  None of the other actors has enough screen time to access their performances.
The film does possess the look of a big budget theatrical film but there was more tension, suspense, and horror in the small screen outings.
If Carter thought this film would gain converts to the X-Files mythology, he was sadly mistaken.

751307,5,6303972969,"Before seeing ""Fight the Future"", I had never had much interest in the X-files. I had always wanted to get into the series, but had been told by ""philers"" (X-file followers) that you really needed to see the series from the beginning to understand all the lore and mythology that was developed by series creator and producer, Chris Carter.
Despite this, I went to see ""X-Files: Fight the Futre"" and I became an immediate fan.  The movie is a great starting point for people unfamiliar with the series.  The movie, through some clever dialogue and settings, gives a brief back history of the characters and events that have led up to the film, which served as a bridge between seasons 5 and 6 of the televison program.  Fans of the series criticized the film, stating that the movie simplifed the immense conspiracy that had been developed by the series, but I found that, having no background with the X-files, it was just the catalyst I needed to launch my interest and give me the foundation for following the series.
The story introduces us to Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovney) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), members of a classified agency within the heart of the F.B.I. that investigates paranormal and extra-terrestrial activities.  It is established early in the film that Mulder and Scully have been removed from the X-files, for reasons which were established in the television series.  Despite this fact, they stumble across an ""incident"" that occurs in Texas, where a cover-up has been put into motion that will lead them to some extraordinary discoveries that nearly costs them their lives.
My synopsis of the film is deliberately vague, and for those of you reading this for understanding, I can say only that it is better that you come into this film with an open mind about it, as I did when I first saw it.  The reason I give for this is that the story is not merely an independent film, but part of a much larger storyline that encompasses a generational television series, with this film serving as one of the high point in the series plot.  You need to approach it without a pre-conceived notion as to what the film is about, because, as I experienced with my inital viewing of the film, the movie left me with as many questions as it answered, and because of my interest in the film, I went in search of a greater understanding of the stories and characters found within the X-files.
The film was obviously produced on a much larger production budget than that of the television show, but, to its credit, the movie does not spend a lot of time using special effects to create tension.  Instead, the tension of the film is built in the same way it is done in the television show-by providing paranoia that stems from shadowy agents within the Federal Government who act in the interest of their private agendas.  The resulting effect is a movie that works well on creating paranoia and leaves you anticipating, but never really knowing, whats going to happen next.
The film features much of the production talent of the series, including direction for Carter, as well as a great soundtrack by Mark Snow, who had the aid of an orchestra to amplify his classic television scoring.  In addition, all of the principles of the series are present.
This movie, in this reviewers opinion, arrived at a time when the X-files was at the prime of its success and popularity, and it is definitely a strong installment in the X-files franchise.  Since my initial viewing of this film, I have become an avid fan, a ""philer"" if you will, and I still find the film to be a great installment in a series which implored that the audience ""TRUST NO ONE"".  Well make an exception and trust me when I say that  ""X-Files: Fight the Future"" is a worthwhile film, and a great adventure for fans of the series, or for those who have never before experienced the adventures and investigations of Mulder and Scully.

751371,4,6303972969,"I agree with a number of other reviewers in saying `X-Files: The Movie' is built for anyone; even if you have not seen a single X-Files episode.  But what separates this movie from the endless chapters of alien chasing and studying is its epic magnitude.  Most people know that Mulder had been claiming aliens abducted his sister from day one.  What this film does is put that issue to rest (amongst others).  So, in essence, this movie offers closure to what has been building from the very first episode.  This film is by no means perfect, as it seems the formulaic ideas of Hollywood are being squeezed in for good measure.  At one point in this movie, there is a connection between Mulder and Scully that hints at a lost romance that never occurred, but should've, between the two stars.  Sure, it lasted only about ten seconds, but the longtime fan might be forced to let out a soft chuckle at how unfitting it was.  Also, even in a movie about extraterrestrials, a few action sequences seemed to go over-the-top.  Watching Mulder dangle and recover like Sylvester Stallone in `Cliffhanger' was something we could've done without.
Once you get passed the few over-exaggerated aspects of the film, everything else seems to work perfectly.  The very beginning of the movie is excellent, a definite attention getter.  And from there the movie works in the same fashion that an episode would.  But it's almost like you're watching four episodes in a row.  And since they don't have to cram a whole x-file into one 30 minute bit, the movie becomes more elaborate and a bit more calm.  Some people might cite this as bad, but others might love it.  The story is well scripted and the acting by everyone is flawless.  Duchovny and Anderson are as good as ever, and other actors like Martin Landau and Mitch Pileggi (as Skinner) do great justice to the movie's brilliant casting.
`X-Files: The Movie' has a pretty apparent target audience.  The average diehard X-fan will obviously enjoy every moment and love it (if they haven't seen it already).  And on the other hand, anyone who hates Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, and every episode they stumbled upon while channel surfing should do their best to avoid this one.  Finally, there's the people in the middle (like me).  If you have seen numerous installments of the X-Files on TV, but don't live and die by them, you will most likely benefit from this film in the same manner that the diehards do.  It is extremely enjoyable, well written from start to finish--minus the few exaggerations--and, again, is an epic culmination that just about every admirer can say they've been waiting for.  Highly recommended... but know what you like beforehand.",1059177600,2,2691,4.779220779220779

751373,2,6303972969,"i eagerly awaited June 3rd for this disc to come out. forget T2 extreme edition, forget Animatrix. GIMME X FILES! i keep wondering if i'm the last X-Files fan left on Earth.
regarding the story itself, it's pretty bland. at the end of season 5 the ""x files dept"" of the fbi was disbanded and mulder+scully are ""reassigned"" onto other departments of which is the beginning of this movie ""fight the future"". this movie feels like an episode of the x-files, a very very bad one, that doesn't even surpass the widescreen bermuda triangle episode. at the end of this movie (i won't spoil it) takes you to season 6 and so on and so forth. as a standalone movie chris carter is trying to do waaay too much. if you were making a movie, just make a GOOD one. don't give me the ""let me attract both new audiences and fanboys"" cause you will fail miserably! and that's what happened to ""fight the future"". you can't be BOTH! just make the best possible movie without trying to please anyone but yourself! the moment you try and target a artistic medium to an 'audience' is th moment the artist himself sold out. we got another very 'dumb+dumberer' 2 episodes of the series itself contained in a movie. well what's the point? with just a few minutes of character interaction in the first half hour then the rest of th movie is spent as one big action sequence after another with little character building. i mean a movie should be BIG and epic but this one feels so SMALL and insignificant! pick any season opener/ending of the series X Files and the small television screen will display the larger scope of the X Files. what i mean is it's the moments of character interaction LEADING up to the action sequences that make a movie important, not the action itself. i hope they don't try to please everyone again with the sequel to the X Files movie. in fact let's hope they spend all these years since '98 working on the script/idea of pleasing themselves (or in Chris's case himself) instead of trying to appease everyone else.
i was going to go right out to the store and buy it right on that date instead of ordering here on Amazon but then i thought... i don't think i would be able to find it since it's such an obscure title in the grand scheme of movies such as Gladiator or Matrix. so i gave up and ordered. and it didn't take long (thx Amazon ;) nearly a few days after i popped in the movie into my huge 5.1 surround sound HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer)... it doesn't disappoint at all! the visual quality was awe-inspiring. the anamorphic transfer dipped into 9megabits/second at times! that means you it's a VERY high resolution transfer (just like superbits) i tried the Dolby Digital 448kps and DTS 768kps and the surround sound is unbelievable. i liked how the implosion of the fed building rocked my subwoofer. i also liked the hovering ship at the end but i won't spoil you further.
the positives aside i was vastly disappointed that the deleted scenes and extras from the pervious incarnation of this movie on DVD weren't included. the original disc was simply letterboxed, that means less resolution of the movie, and the Dolby Digital was 300ish, lackluster compared to DTS. i never bought that DVD cause i knew one day Fox or Chris Carter was bound to update the XF disc into a ""SE"". i always liked to own the ""definitive"" edition of things. like T2, i tohught ""Ultimate Edition"" was it but now i come to find out there's another one. anyway i thought this disc was it. now that date has arrived but they stripped out everything that was on the 'frist edition' DVD that came out. there wasn't even a 2nd disc with extras on it. this disc plays like a bastard child that has weathered more share of trouble in its life. it comes out on top at the end with very nice quality presentation. that's why i'm giving it 2 stars. for me... it was an emotional roller coaster ride, i waited half a decade for a DVD of The X-Files Fight the Future and this is what came my way? it's apparent to me now that Chris Carter+gang do not really care much for the fans of th series just like George Lucas. even if XF2 movie comes out i doubt it'll ever surpass the first 5 years of the X-Files series on television.

751377,5,6303972969,"At the end of the outstanding fifth season, Chris Carters genius found a new canvas via the silver screen in this, the culmination of five years of superb episodic television.  On the silver screen; The X-Files, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are in every way movie stars and the genre in this format are visually stunning.  Chris Carters genius shines through as this film was made prior to shooting the fifth season of the episode and therefore they had to design the entire fifth season around the film.  In no uncertain terms, Chris Carter and the other producers of the series proved that they could exceed even their own high standards and take the genre to the silver screen.  The only real question is, now that the series is over after nine years, are or when are they going to film a second movie?
The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS
At the conclusion of the fifth season, The X-Files have been closed as those who have been conspiring with the alien forces have desired to do, since Mulder and Scully were getting a little too close to their flame.
The movie opens with a stunning scene taking the viewers back thirty five thousand years where we witness an encounter between cavemen and an alien.  We're then taken to the present day where Mulder and Scully are in Dallas, TX.  The X-Files are closed and they're working as normal agents, searching for a bomb on a hot Texas day.  Unfortunately for them, although Mulder discovers the location of the bomb, it still goes off, killing a senior agent and supposedly three other people in the building.  This leads to the FBI needing scapegoats and directing the separation of Mulder and Scully.  Of course, Mulder can't sit still for this and in the only way he and Scully know how, they begin to uncover the conspirators' plots.
What follows is simply a silver screen masterpiece as we are finally, after five wonderful years of questions, given some answers.  Unfortunately along with these long awaited answers we find that there are more questions.  As the producers of the show have stated all along, they've been making television movies all along and were ready for the big screen, so right they were.
Exceptional performances by David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, William B. Davis and Mitch Pileggi.  Nods to Chris Carter and director Rob Bowman for casting Martin Landau.  Mark Snow who has done the score for every episode is, of course, given the opportunity to exceed his own high standards in the film, as the score is beautifully played out.  Highlighting the score is the film being digitally THX mastered.
Bonus Features:
The Making of ""The X-Files;"" Audio Commentary; Extra Footage and Theatrical Trailers.  Included in the DVD case is a special eight page booklet giving a short synopsis of several of ""The X-Files"" key players and a small card displaying one of the many wonderful paintings done of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny.
I would highly recommend this film, even for the casual viewer or somebody new to the genre as the filmmakers ensured to make it accessible to even those who'd never once seen an episode.",1042761600,62,3099,4.807909604519774
751378,5,6303972969,"I will always consider The X-Files to be the greatest TV programme of the 1990's - maybe of all-time, but that may be pushing it a bit. I have been an avid viewer for years now and think it's a great shame that it's finally ended. Even so, The X-Files is a TV show that will never be forgotten. Repeats will still be shown in decades time. After Season 5 of this amazing TV show, Chris Carter (creator/director) decided to make a big-screen film to tie up a few loose ends that occured in the previous seasons...
The film opens in the past - 35,000 BC actually in North Texas. It's a cold and barren place, probably around the time of the Ice Age. Something happens that we know nothing about, but will set the way forward for the rest of the film when two primates are attacked by what seems to be an alien. After this, we move to present day Dallas, Texas where the FBI are investigating a terrorist bomb threat in the Federal Building. We shortly meet our two heroes, agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In short, we're told that the X-Files have been closed but that Mulder and Scully are still partnered. Scully is somewhat exasperated because her partner is again being unorthodox and searching another building across the street from the one the rest of the Bureau is searching. Mulder and Scully soon learn that the bomb is in the building opposite the one suspected. An FBI agent claims he can defuse the bomb - but he doesn't. The building is evacuated as the FBI Agent just sits there as the seconds tick away. The building does explode, but instead of Mulder and Scully being hailed as heroes, they're hauled in front of an inquiry to explain why five people died instead of the countless number that would have died had the bomb not been discovered. Thinking this to be a cover-up of something much more massive, Mulder and Scully begin going on an undercover hunt for significant clues as to the reasons for the deaths of the three deceased, and Scully concludes that what killed them consists of a new form of life that drains away the nutrients of the human body. Moreover, as they continue their explorations, under the watchful eye of several conspirators that have taken different sides, they find that there is a much larger cover-up, one that holds the key to the destruction of all mankind and the beginning of a new species...
Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau) is supposedly an old friend of Mulder's father - but this is the X-Files, so who can you trust? Kurtzweil supplies Mulder with what he believes to be vital and secret government information that helps Mulder and Scully uncover the truth. Kurtzweil writes books on alien conspiracies, although no one believes him. Mulder and Scully investigate unmarked tanker trucks that supposedly carry an alien virus. They are led to the desert when crop fields are being grown. Scully is stung by a wasp later on and is infected with this alien virus. She is taken away to Antarctica by these alien foes in human form to join the rest of the humans who have been infected with this virus. Mulder doesn't know the whereabouts of Scully, but is helped by an unknown, known only as 'The Well-Manicured Man' in the credits. The Well-Manicured Man works for the FBI and is trying to keep the truth underwraps. He decides to put an end to it by giving Mulder a vaccine to the virus to help Scully, knowing his life will be over once it's found out what he tells Mulder. Until the Dallas incident, the FBI believed that the virus would simply control the entire worldy population - that mass-infection would make them a slave race - imagine their surprise when the aliens began to gestate. Along with the vaccine to the virus, the man gives Mulder the co-ordinates in Antarctica to the location of where Scully is. Mulder has 96 hours to arrive at Wilkes Land, Antarctica to save Scully before it's too late. As the film draws nearer to the end, we learn a lot more about what's going on - not the whole truth, of course (this is the X-Files, don't you know?!). Millions of years ago, aliens arrived on planet Earth. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age in the form of an evolved pathogen, waiting to be re-constituted by the alien race when it comes to colonize Earth, using the human race as hosts. Against this, the FBI has no defence but this weak vaccine given to Mulder by the unknown man. With the information and cure in hand, Mulder sets off to Antarctica to rescue Scully from the aliens. This plot to the film may sound incredibly corny, yet it is phenomenally believable and totally absorbing. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson give exceptional performances in the X-Files movie and the plot is intriguing and engrossing to say the least. The film can also be very moving at times, especially the hallway scene where Mulder and Scully almost kiss and the final five minutes in Antarctica. Other co-stars includes X-Files series regulars Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and a special appearance from The Lone Gunmen. Will Mulder save Scully from the alien race? And will the truth finally be revealed to the rest of the world? Watch it and see!

Yes, but a lot of the characters will not get much of an explanation, so you will find yourself trying to understand the important of what you see.  If you have never seen the TV show, then watching the movie will let you know what it is like.
Mulder and Scully are two special agents fighting against a global conspiracy.  The conspirators are very powerful as you will see from the movie.  As in the series, the powers-that-be work to discredit Mulder, so he will not have the power to keep digging into their schemes.  They even ignore his efforts at one point by stating that ""he is only one man.""  Mulder is our Everyman who takes on the big concerns.
As mentioned earlier, without being familiar with the characters of the show, you will not understand the significance of the characters in the movie.  Who are the Lone Gunmen?  They are here in the movie, but don't have much of a part.  Since it is not explained, you will have to watch the series to understand.  The same is true for the Smoking Man.
Like the cases that Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are trying to unravel, this movie is giving you small clues to something much larger.  The movie answers some questions from the show, but it also opens up new ones.  The search for truth is never-ending.  All we know is that it is out there somewhere.

Once again they're showing us to be two of the most original & absorbing writers, dealing with a fragrant subject for an X-file, satanism. The unusual practisings being a bunch of secretive school inspectors, another feature of the well-known black humor. A mystical woman with a snake's eye & organs in  her deskdraw, is also doing her part of the tricks, and it all gets more exciting.
Irresistible presents a real weirdo, perfectly acted by Nick Chinlund (Billy Bedlam, Con Air) When you hear this psycho talk, you know something isn't right about him.  He's also a deadly fetishist, collecting hair and nails from his victims. Cutting off their fingers, when starts killing on his own, instead of only picking on dead people. The episode is extraordinary, because of the much emotion it adds to the character of Scully. Making her very fragile, when hitting her weak spot. Gillian Anderson is credible here, & I like the last scene where she really let go of all her feelings in front of Mulder.

The acting is amazing, Gillian Anderson portrays a more vulnerable Scully than we usually see.  Her acting in this episode is simply superb.  And the guy who plays Donnie Pfaster is also very talented, he brings the character to life as a creepy, creepy guy.  Creepy is why we love the X-Files, and this episode is plenty creepy.  At the end, there is tender, beautiful scene with Mulder and Scully.  It isn't to sappy, it can be enjoyed by both No-Romos and Shippers like myself.  It is also the first in a sequence of two episodes about Donnie Pfaster, the death fetishist.  He comes back in Season 7, to go after Scully yet again.  I guess the thought he was such a great character that they had to bring him back.  One of my favorite episodes ever.
Die Hand Die Verletzt is also a superb episode.  It is creepy, and at times funny too.  It does get dark for a while, and it's not happy go lucky, although it does involve raining toads, water going down the drain the wrong way, and one *big* snake.  Not to mention a weird PTA and an even weirder substitute teacher.
I could watch both of these episodes hundreds of times, no exaggaration. They are amazing, and I highly recommend them.  You don't even need too much background on the series to see them.

First of all. What the hell is the black oil? From watching the Show, one could conclude that it is..
1. An intelligent alien life form, capable of human posession and transubstantiation.
2. A Substance created by our ""Shadow Governemnt"" that will assimilate human DNA into Alien (thereby turning humans into Aliens), when the invasion occurs.
Well, The movie decides to put a new spin on this already impossible puzzle. We are now to believe that the Black oil is a substance (of unknown origin) that will impregnate a human being with an Alien fetus. Not acceptable!
My guess is that they had to construct this film together under a very tight deadline. It shows. Scenes that should have been done again are left to their initial badness. The actors sound as if they're doing a cold reading of the script.
Smoking man! He had one of the most dramatic entrances I have ever seen in Hollywood history (the blaring white lights, in the dark Kansas night, with the wind of the helicopter disheveling his hair, as he reaches for his trademark cigarette....Tadaah! Its him!). I thought the movie would finally start to pick up once he arrived. Nope. He just just bummed around, mumbled his usual assortment of vague facist innuendos, and puffed his Morleys. The movie could have functioned just as well without him. He did nothing, Niether Did Skinner, the Lone Gunman, or any of the show's featured regulars. Such crucial supporting characters as Marita Covarubias, Alex Krycek, and the Alien Bounty Hunter were left out of the film completely. That's why I say this movie wasn't one for the fans.

751616,3,6303972969,"I might get in trouble with ""X Files"" fanatics in this review. Lucky for me, you only know my Email address. I sound as paranoid as Scully and Mulder.
There were raging debates over the merits of the movie version of the long running Fox network series. Fans of the show seemed to be divided between those who thought it was a spectacular picture and those who thought it somehow betrayed the spirit of the series. People who had not watched it on TV came out of theaters either mesmerized or clueless.
I think I know the reason for all the emotional reactions. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a film has been made based on a network series that is still in production. ...
I personally have watched maybe five episodes of ""The X Files"", partly because I lead a life which has no routine schedule. My eccentric life aside, I found it to be less original than ""Twin Peaks"", which was also about an FBI agent dealing with things most mysterious. It also did not have the divine humor of the bizarre ""Northern Exposure"", which isn't science fiction, but does seem to describe life on another planet.
It is obvious to me that, had the movie been made after the series had finished production, it might have been great. As it is, the creators could not develop a plot that gave too much away, since that would have damaged the current season. If the flick had been an original idea, it would have ranked somewhere in-between ""Independence Day"" and ""Total Recall"".
I understood the movie well enough. I also have enough awareness of the series to find Scully's always doubting Mulder to be getting rather tiresome. If she hasn't clued in by now, then she's not cut out to be a detective. I kept thinking she'd be better off going to medical school, as she always threatens to do.
The climax of the film takes place in Antarctica. Mulder is wearing a Walmart parka and gloves which he takes off a few minutes after his arrival. As someone pointed out to me, in the movie's seasonal timeframe, it would be about seventy degrees below zero there. But then, this is yet another sci-fi story where the fate of the entire human race is in the hands of one man. So I suppose we are lucky he didn't die of frostbite.
To ""The X Files"" credit, they are having a devil of a time defeating the aliens. This is refreshing. In Hollywood, it is a given that we are attacked by vastly superior beings from outer space. Oddly, we always win. By that logic, if America attacked the Fiji Islands, they would annihilate us.",1017273600,,2517,4.473913043478261

What is there not to say about the X-Files? It is one of the most recognized TV series of this decade, and its transition from the small to the silver screen is seamless. Mulder and Scully, flawlessly performed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, are FBI agents, who on the TV series pursue paranormal, non-mainstream cases for the Bureau. In the movie, their interests are widened to a global conspiracy involving aliens, a shadow government, and an elite group of men who may hold the fate of the world in their hands. Wonderful special effects, including a larger-than-life alien ship, vast Anarctic landscapes, and fantastically believable alien beings all add to the movie. The relationship between Mulder and Scully is highlighted in this movie; a few scenes between the two characters illustrates their close relationship and caring for one another. Duchovny and Anderson have a rare chemistry and their intelligent, teasing banter is one of the best parts of the film. The movie is filled with mysterious characters, suspenseful scenes, and is action-packed from the slightly rocky beginning to the climatic ending. The DVD edition is wonderful. Behind the scenes clips and commentaries from the creator and producer, Chris Carter, and the director, Rob Bowman, are very informative and vital to all X-Philes. It is not necessary to be a watcher of the show to understand the movie, even though the mythology of the show is long and involved; in fact, the movie has turned many a non-watcher into an avid fan of the show. This is a great movie for fans and non-fans who love a sophisticated, thrilling, action-packed movie with elements of science fiction. Be warned, this is not the typical summer blockbuster.",1012694400,7,1829,5.079734219269103

751620,3,6303972969,"The first time I watched The X Files movie Fight the Future, I didn't like it. In fact, it bored me to tears. But that was three years ago and I was only a minor X Files fan at the time.
Now, however, I own the first four seasons on DVD and have the Nitpickers Guide for X-Philes by my side as I watch each episode.
So I figured it was time to go back to give Fight the Future another try.
Okay, it was better this time. But only because I am now a bona fide X-Phile. If I was still a marginal fan, or someone who didn't know much at all about The X Files, the movie would still bore me to tears.
Let's face it, gang, this movie could have been far better. Look at the facts:
1. The big screen and the unlimited possibilities for it.
2. All the show's top stars reprising their roles.
3. Chris Carter.
4. Additional movie stars (such as the always interesting Martin Landau) along for the ride.
Yet...
I thought there were more thrills and chills in a few classic episodes of the TV show than I found in this entire movie! Frankly, Fight the Future was like watching an extended episode of the TV show -- with only an occasional cuss word thrown in to prove that it wasn't television.
As I said, I enjoyed watching the movie this time because I've come to know and like Scully and Mulder. I think David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson make a great team. Plus, now I understand who the Lone Gunmen are. And I can see that Skinner has a little decency inside of himself after all (in spite of his hardass exterior).
In other words I Get It. I'm with ya, Chris.
But the first X Files movie just never reached the level it could have. All the stops weren't pulled out. I think everyone was still thinking ""small screen"" when they should have been thinking ""SILVER SCREEN!"".
For the next X Files movie (and I hear one is being considered), why not try thinking TOTALLY outside of the box -- the TV box, that is.

Carter includes enough tasty story elements to appeal to followers while keeping it simple enough for the uninitiated to fully appreciate, if not completely understand. The special effects were amazing as well: the explosion in Dallas, the ice falling away in Antarctica and the detail of the aliens are all vital visual elements that were perfected through five years of producing the TV show. Duchovny and Anderson sparkle as Mulder and Scully, and the regular cameos from the series all make appearances. A must-see.",993600000,2,735,4.888
751768,4,6303972969,"I have to say that I was a fan of The X-files in its earlier series before too many continuing storylines ruined the flow and off-kilter appeal of the television series.  The film, however, is very, very good, because it is truly the last of the best episodes of The X-files before they moved into the aforementioned continuing storylines.
FIGHT THE FUTURE is very visual, and some of the best sets and buildings ever in modern cinema are incorporated in this film.  Many of these great sets are brought to gloomy excellence by the dead-on direction of Rob Bowman (check out his THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS for more great visuals - nice cars/effects, lously story).  Anderson and Duchovny are, as always, perfect in their roles and they seem to be having a lot more fun, what with being able to swear and such.
This is a very accomplished film and you don't even have to be a fan of The X-files to enjoy it... but it doesn't hurt at all if you are.",993168000,,945,4.419540229885057

And come on! There are too many coincidences in story - Oh yes so they just happen to be in a place where they see two tanker trucks going past on a train and know instinctively that those are the tanker trucs they are looking for. And what about the aliens? They use human bodies to incubate and gestate at an incredibly fast rate..remind you of anything??? The only difference is that they do not have acid for blood...come on that's a give away! ""Aliens"" rip off, ""Independence Day"" rip off. Good points? Well, someof it was shot in London so they do admit that other countries besides the US exist...but wait! It's the US and FEMA that will create the conditions for the aliens arriving or make the vaccine. Come on! Finally, if aliens do come to earth, what sort of reception will they have with paranoic drivvel lke this being made? We are all expectingt hem to be hostile, when, it is more likely that we are judging them by our own ideas of right and wrong. The X files used to be good, despite Duchovny and Anderson being unable to act. They both speak in monotone, their gamut of emotions runs from A to A. But despite that it used to be interesting.

David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do a great job of portraying Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.  To this day, I have seen the movie a total of 182 times, and that number continues to grow almost weekly.  The movie is just another part of the confusing yet exciting web that Chris Carter weaves.  From the FEMA offices of Dallas, to the cornfields of, somewhere in Texas that I can't remember right now, to the freezing syndicate base in Antartica, the movie is never boring.  My favorite part is the hallway scene, but being a ""shipper"", that's expected.  The movie is a reminder of perhaps a ""happier"" time of the X-files, you know before Doggett and all that crap.

751835,4,6303972969,"""The X-Files"" as a television show has never really held any interest for me. I have yet to see a single episode of the show, and I doubt I'll be starting soon. Which is why it was such a shock that, upon completing the movie version of the franchise, ""The X-Files: Fight the Future,"" I found that I completely enjoyed it from beginning to end. It will come as a surprise that, even though it helps to have some knowledge of the characters and plot of the show, it is not fully needed to grasp the storyline the movie follows. It has a classical feel to it, one that encompasses sci-fi films of the past, while giving us a powerpunch of superb acting and lasting intensity.
The movie begins in the B.C. era, in the area that will later be known as the state of Texas. Two primate-resembling figures are attacked by a strange creature in an underground cave. Moving ahead to the present day, a small child is inflicted with what appear to be black worms and is taken away to an unknown location, along with the bodies of two firemen who attempted to rescue him. Soon after, a building in Dallas, Texas, is bombed and destroyed, and special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully discover that the bodies of the firemen and the boy were in the building when the bomb went off.
Thinking this to be a coverup of something much more massive, Mulder and Scully begin going on an undercover hunt for significant clues as to the reasons for the deaths of the three deceased, and Scully concludes that what killed them consists of a new form of life that drains away the nutrients of the human body. Moreover, as they continue their explorations, under the watchful eye of several conspirators that have taken different sides, they find that there is a much larger coverup, one that holds the key to the destruction of all mankind and the beginning of a new species.
There is not really a whole lot to say in opposition of the movie from my point of view. I'm sure a lot of the fans of the TV series will have their quibbles and problems with it, but for me, it was a satisfying movie that delivers all the goods a thriller should have and then some. The story unfolds at a slow and steady pace, which allows us to take in everything that's intrical to the plot. The story is also quite simple despite its complexity, which keeps it watchable for non-show fans as well. It begins with deaths, moves into the investigation, and becomes a cat-and-mouse thriller in which you have no idea who to trust, or what to think about the events at hand.
What makes the story even better is that it does not focus solely on Mulder and Scully's quest, but also on the point of view of other important characters who play key roles. Those characters include Kurtzweil, who gives Mulder clues and hints as to the location of the bodies and events going on, and an unnamed man, whom we never know if we can trust or not during his onscreen time. Each person is introduced at different points in the movie, and some of them may lose their lives, but not before giving us, as an audience, all the information we need to keep up with the main characters' quest for the final answer to the puzzle.
The movie has a surprisingly high suspense quotient, which remains somewhat subtle until the story picks up. There are the moments of building suspense, which lies in the scenes such as the one in which Mulder and Scully make a trip to Texas to search for evidence of a biological dig site where the virus was first discovered. And then we have our high-intensity action sequences, such as the one in which the two are being chased through a cornfield by helicopters, and final showdown in the Arctic as Mulder travels there to save his partner. This added intensity does a good job of keeping us involved with the movie, and also brings a high sense of the unknown to a movie whose plot is strictly that.
The virus is the key centerpiece for the entire movie. While it does not tie everything together in the end, it leaves nothing unturned. First we have the beginning sequences, in which the alien in the beginning later comes back in the form of a virus that quickly infects its victims. Later comes the corn crops and bees, which are revealed to be a transportation system for that virus. This leaves us with certain questions, ones that involve the motives of the conspirators as to whether or not they are trying to expedite the virus or keep it from spreading. Some of the factors conflict, and the ending never really gives us all the answers we need, but it does achieve its goal of keeping the story moving.
David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take their television roles and turn them into brilliance on the big screen. Duchovny is Mulder, who is stern in his beliefs, and never gives in once he receives a clue until he has fully checked it out. His determination is a key part in the unfolding of the story, as well as in keeping the story moving at a strong pace. Gillian Anderson is the major brains of the duo, using her scientific expertise to discover the nature of the viral infection and where it originated. Her clues are what take them all across the country, and Anderson plays out all of Scully's intelligence brilliantly and with incredible believability. These characters speak so fluidly and seriously about their opinions and findings that we have no reason to doubt them at all.
""The X-Files: Fight the Future,"" is surprisingly easy to watch, even if you have no background of the television show. It may prove to be a letdown for fans of the show, but those of us interested in a solid story with intensity and likeable characters that is easy to follow will be pleased with the movie's well-structured plot, character development and moments of high-speed intensity.",984700800,5,5762,4.536023054755043

I really had no idea how a movie was going to differ from the TV series before I went to see it, but anyone who has seen the show is sure to notice a difference! For one thing there is no way the budget for an episode is as big as it was for the movie. For instance, the huge explosion! And the large cornfield with bee-filled buildings. The movie is totally awesome! David and Gillian have never done a better job acting. I was really amazed to see them even better than they had been. Even non-fans of the series will understand the movie though. There's no secret that only us X-Philes know!",984528000,2,718,4.2101449275362315
751837,5,6303972969,"I am glad to see that this film has been given positive reviews.  True, the film is now a few years old, but it will withstand the test of time for any X-files fan out there.
To me, the movie now seems just like an extension of the story of these two characters that for me, redefined how good television can be.  With the movie, we get more of what we want with the X-Files.  Since the first two seasons have been released on DVD, I've bought both of them, and the third is soon to come.  Seeing the episodes all together and in order makes me like this movie a hundred time more, just because of the story that Chris Carter has woven throughout these eight incredible seasons.
Some reviews below this have critisized this film for being 'less than it should have been' and 'just one big long episode, nothing more'.  That first statement I disagree with completely.  The second is totally true.  But, it is a big long episode with cinematic scope.  On the DVD commentary, Chris Carter even mentioned that this film WAS the pivotol, huge episode of the X-Files.  It just has what I think is good cinematic appeal.
The story continues the story that the television show set up through the first four seasons.  It continues on to uncover all new truths to the government conspiracy surrounding the existence and plans of extraterrestrial life.  In the end, we see enough pieces to realize just how big it is.
Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny play their roles brilliantly.  These two roles, in my opinion, are the best two ever written for television and film together.  These two actors fall into their parts so well, they create two totally different and very beleivable characters.  The chemistry between these two characters is portrayed so well that you might even feel like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are two real people.  This film and the television show portrays a deep love between these two people, not filled with sex or too much physical attraction, but by overwhelming respect for one another.  It is so nice to see this for a change, instead of the regular stuff we see in most movies.  I think Duchovny and Anderson portray their respect for each other very realistically; in other words they don't end up in bed together the same night that they kiss each other on the forhead!  Hats off to these two actors who really did and still do their job so well.
The X-Files had an image to maintain for its fans when making this film.  Obviously this is Chris Carter's story, but it had to live up to what the fans would expect.  In my opinion, the movie did.  When I first went to it in theaters, I was 14, and didn't love the show as much as I do now.  I still was a major fan.  When I saw it and it was finished, I remember thinking that it was really good.  Now, when I see it nestled between two seasons, when I see it as part of the whole big picture, I absolutely love it.  When it was in theaters, I remember thinking that they could have done something more with it.  Now I wouldn't want it changed for anything.
This is a different kind of Cinema that we have ever seen before.  This film fits in exactly with the television show, only now it is written as one big episode that is started and finished in two hours, while still leaving it hanging to continue season 6.  It is filmed with style and the same craft that the show is filmed with, only now with a widescreen cinematic scope.  The story and the characters, as I said before, are something we don't get in many movies today.  This film is fresh, thrilling, thought provoking, believable, and an all around good time.  As I said before, it is even better now, seeing what has happened since.
To say a few things about the television show, now in season 8.  I was skeptical about these new characters that have come on the show.  Let me just say that I am more than happy with what Chris Carter has done since David Duchovny wanted less time on the show.  Also, we are seeing Gillian Anderson more tired acting and different than she was in the beginning of this series.  This might be because she wants OFF, but she is the only one who can decide that.  She is still playing her role brilliantly, and the change in her is just what the show needed, and exactly what would be expected to happen to anyone who has suffered such a loss.  Good job Mr. Carter and Ms. Anderson for keeping the show real!  The new characters are great as well, and wonderful editions to the show.  Well, one last thing to say.  The last episode that was aired, 'THIS IS NOT HAPPENING', was incredible.  It reminded me how special and different this show really is.
And Mr. Carter, doing more films after season 9 would be a really good thing!  I think it would be best if the films, unless they become a series in themselves, should stay focused on the 'big picture', like Fight the Future was.  The conspiracy ones are the most interesting I think, and provide the most thought.  More movies about the conspiracy, plus maybe a few 'stand alones' would be great!  Thank you everyone involved with the X-Files for creating something this good.  This show is what makes television worth watching.",983404800,2,5151,4.449306296691569

The story was relatively easy to follow, we got all the info we needed about past events to feel knowledgable enough, the Action Set Pieces are worthy of any Summer Blockbuster and the Conspiracys are Actually Believable.

The TV series was so well produced, and for the mostpart well-written, that I felt it's ""theatrical"" quality would surely prove to be fantastic on the big screen. Unfortunately, my expectations were met with a letdown, and I left the film feeling jipped. Sure there was still the great characters of Skully and Mulder (the most likeable in recent TV history), but the story was less than inventive and in my mind proved that all Fox wanted to do was pull more non-viewers into the fold.
Last week though, I broke down and purchased the DVD in DTS and went home to watch it. WOW, not only did I enjoy the movie more, but the DVD was of an extremely high quality. The picture was beautiful (better than the Theater), and the sound...absolutely perfect.
I have to say that Chris Carter and his talented team of producers certainly inject great care and attention to detail in their DVDs. I also have the first season set on DVD and the transfers from film are crisp and the audio clear. Definitely worth the money, and one of those series that you can pop-in on rainy day and enjoy it no matter how many times you've seen it.

751842,4,6303972969,"""The X-Files: Fight the Future"" is an endlessly fascinating and complicated movie that ties together all the mythology pieces from the popular series upon which it's based.  Although I think that people who never watch the show can enjoy this movie, I doubt they can understand it very well.  Heck, I watch the show religiously and I still don't think I understand everything.
However, it succeeds in introducing the audience to the characters of Agents Mulder and Scully, without rehashing the things that are familiar to the fans of the show.  When we are first introduced to our favorite duo, their conversation on their cell phones is enjoyable to both old audiences and new ones alike.
The film also makes clear the deep affection and love Mulder and Scully feel for each other--something regular viewers already know--which comes to a head in the famous hallway scene outside of Mulder's apartment.
The film is top quality, as we've come to expect no less from ""The X-Files,"" with an intelligent story-line, great action sequences and special effects, and plenty of aliens to satisfy the sci-fi junkie in all of us.  But don't get me wrong--you don't have to be a sci-fi junkie to enjoy this film.  You have to like a good suspense/thriller, with some action, intelligent story-telling, and yes, a little bit of hinted-at romance.  I mean, for ""The X-Files,"" any 'Shipper will tell you that this is a pretty romantic movie.  As one of those so-called 'Shippers, I was very angry at that darn bee, which was my biggest disappointment.
The DVD itself is nicely presented, with all the theatrical trailers, an informative commentary track by Rob Bowman and Chris Carter, and an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.  Best of all, it has added footage not originally in the theatrical version.

Movies of this type, often don't tie in well with the television shows from which they are derived, i.e. Mission Impossible, Star Trek, and The Fugitive. Don't get me wrong they are all excellent in their own right, they just do not stay totally true to the mythos from which they were spawned. X-Files: Fight the Future, however, does stay true to the series from which it is derived, and extends and fleshs out some of the mythos that accompanies the series.

Those who have never seen the show won't have trouble watching the movie because it's self-contained. That is the genius of Chris Carter. He has created a movie where it works perfectly as a contiuation of the previous season finale titled ""The End"" for fans, but still works perfectly for non-fans and will entertain both groups even more with the season premiere that followed titled ""The Beginning."" The movie isn't total spectacle, but it's smart and creepy and richly-photographed. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are also great actors and Rob Bowman has a lot of style in his directing. ""The X-Files Movie"" is a nice mystery thriller.

As a fan of the X-Files, going back to its beginning, I really liked the way the movie fit into the existing mythos. The series has lost its way in seasons six through eight, and while I'll continue to watch it until it stops airing new episodes, this movie is beginning to look more and more like the good old days of the X-Files.  It was meant to be as standalone as possible, but has enough subtle references to the mythos to please those in the know.
I have my doubts that the movie brought in new fans to the tv series, but the partial absence of David Duchovny in season eight should have been total, freeing the writers and producers from the burden of his massive self-involvement, and allowing Gillian Anderson to shine.  She plans to be out of there after season nine, and frankly I'd rather see a new dynamic duo take over in entire, both in the series and in any future movies.
The series is long in the tooth.  Perhaps the approach used for the Dick Van Dyke Show years ago -- pulling the plug at the end of the fifth season -- should be a law or something.

751920,4,6303972969,"I wouldn't pretend to be one who regularly watches the television series on which this film is based.  However, I've often watched and have always  marveled at how life is played out in the head of creator Chris Carter.  To  base a motion picture on a television series, you have to give a regular  viewer more than you would normally and yet still make the movie  comprehensible to the viewer of happenstance.  I think Mr. Carter  succeeded.
The movie opens in the past.  Quite a ways past, in fact.  30,000 B.C. in a place we now know as North Texas.  At this point in time,  North Texas is a cold and barren place but something happens which sets the  stage for what is about to come.
After this incident, we move to  ""present-day"" Dallas, Texas where the FBI is investigating a  terrorist bomb threat in the Federal Building.  We shortly meet our two  heroes, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and agent Dana Scully (Gillian  Anderson).  In short order, we're told that the X-Files have been closed  but that Mulder and Scully are still partnered.  Scully is somewhat  exasperated because her partner is again being unorthodox and searching  another building across the street from the one the rest of the Bureau is  searching.  Finding nothing, Scully and Mulder prepare to leave the  building when Mulder decides to buy a soda from a nearby vending machine.  Instead, what he finds is the vending machine unplugged and a bomb -- a  very big bomb -- inside it.  And Mulder is locked in the room with it.  This being the 90s, Mulder calls Scully on his cellular phone and she  arranges to have the building cleared and the FBI team brought to the  building to get Mulder out and defuse the bomb.  One part of the plan  works.
This is brilliant screenwriting because once you accept that agent  Mulder is a tad unorthodox and has an uncanny knack for stumbling into the  truth, it's completely believable to believe a scenario that would have a  terrorist call in a threat to one building and blow up a different one.  The resulting explosion evokes memories of the Oklahoma City bombing quite  chillingly.  However, instead of Scully and Mulder being hailed as heroes,  they're hauled in front of an inquiry to explain why five people died  instead of the countless number that would have died had the bomb not been  discovered.
As Mr. Carter points out in a short ""Making Of...""  presentation before the movie begins, the truth is not always the truth and  things are not always as they seem.  The Dallas bombing sets off a chain  of events which takes us not only through the Southwest, but to England,  Antarctica, and Tunisia.
This really is an excellent piece of filmmaking  and there's lots of credit to go around.  First, there's a solid, finely  nuanced  story by creator/screenwriter Carter and collaborator Frank  Spotnitz.  This is a piece of work that stands completely on its own.  You  don't have to be a fan of the television series to enjoy the film; however,  the movie is almost completely consistent with the series and fits like a  puzzle piece with it.  The acting is really quite superb.  David Duchovny  and Gillian Anderson are fresh and lively in their portrayals of Mulder and  Scully.  There is a guest appearance by Martin Landau as a conspiracy  theorist doctor who, in shadowy fashion, guides Mulder toward the truth.  Blythe Danner appears as the chief investigator of an inquiry where the  outcome seems already determined.  Series regulars are much in evidence as  well.  Mitch Pileggi as Assistant Director Walter Skinner and, especially,  William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man keep the action moving  throughout the film.
Regardless of whether you're a fan of the series or  not, this film will make a fine evening's entertainment.

751921,5,6303972969,"Season 2 of X Files had plenty of great shows, two of the better/best ones are included here and both dabble with the creepy and scary aspects of the  dark side.
IRRISISTABLE has our intrepid FBI duo traveling to chilly  Minnesota and learn that a grave desecration thought to be done by aliens  is actually the work of a morbid cosmetologist with a penchant for young  women's hair and other body parts.  Mulder faces impossible odds at finding  the sicko in Minneapolis but at the same time he must deal with the fact  that Scully's strong independence is permitting her from expressing to  Mulder that she is terrified of the foe they seek.
I am not a shipper  (Non X fans, this is a person who likes to see involvement in Mulder and  Scully's personal lives together) but the penultimate scene to this episode  with Mulder and Scully is very special nor is it sappy in the least, and I  applaud the writers and actors for pulling it off well.  In the whole  series, it is one of if not my most favorite scenes.
DIE HAND DER  VERLETZT is a step deeper into darkness where some New England  highschoolers are trying to impress their girlfriends with they're  ""dark powers"" and may have accidentally conjured up more then  they could chew when everybody starts noticing odd changes in town  particularly when the school kids start dying and acting strange.  Mulder  and Scully step in to investigate the mayhem and may end up the victims of  a town's dirty secret.
This isn't an episode for the meek or timid as  some rather unpleasant goings on are abundant.  Anyone else though have  fun, especially trying to figure out what part and what character Mrs.  Paddock, substitute teacher has in the show.
Up for a fun evening with  nasty things going on?  By all means pick up this chapter in the X Files  second season.",967766400,3,1819,4.579439252336448

It was just so good. i recently became an x phile following all the episodes on fox and fx but when i saw this movie i was blown away. i began  to fit all the pieces together from the past episodes and relate them to  things in the movie. i must say i was a little disappointed about the  little ALMOST kiss but i do agree that it would spoil the whole show if the  Mulder and Scully were together. My favorite scene was the cornfield. it  was just an adrenaline rush to watch parts of this movie and i even  screamed a couple of times out of surprise. One of the best monsters in the  history of x files is in this movie. The scene that tells about Mulder's  sister is definetely a turning point in movie. it was not in the theatre  version so if you only went to the theatre then you must see this scene. it  tells you basically what happened to Samantha. Another great scene is at  the end when the ship is flying away Mulder asks scully if she saw it and  in a barely audible whisper she says yes even though she probably didn't  since her face was in the snow.

751953,5,6303972969,"Although the ""Pusher"" episode left little impression on me, I  give this video recording five stars for the latter episode alone. Written  by Darin Morgan, known for funny and intellectually subtle  ""X-Files"" scripts (as well as for playing the infamous  ""Flukeman""), ""Jose Chung's from Outer Space"" ranks as  one of the best episodes in the series. Charles Nelson Reilly portrays  perfectly the eccentric Chung, who interviews Scully for a  ""non-fiction science fiction"" book about an alien abuction and  crash of an extraterrestrial craft that may or may not have occurred near a  small town. Various characters give their own accounts of what occurred,  including a teenage couple supposedly abducted by ""grays""; an  electrical worker threatened by a double-talking ""man in black""  (played by a pre-gubernatorial Jesse Ventura); and a loser obsessed with  conspiracy theories and role-playing games who perceives Mulder and Scully  as brutal co-conspirators trying to cover up the crash.
Comparisons to  ""Rashomon"" seem quite obvious, but Morgan does not confine this  episode to that evident allusion. In-jokes about the show and popular  culture in general abound, including allusions to the infamous ""Alien  Autopsy"" video. Also, Morgan gives a cyclopian alien the moniker  ""Lord Kinbote,"" alluding to the unreliable narrator of Vladimir  Nabokov's novel ""Pale Fire."" I read somewhere that Morgan  considers Nabokov one of his favorite writers. How appropriate, considering  Nabokov's own penchant for unreliable narrators (like Humbert in  ""Lolita"") who distort and misperceive reality, and for throwing a  variety of allusions (obvious and arcane) into his novels. Whether you  understand everything in this episode or not, Morgan's little gem provides  a well-done change of pace from the usual ""X-Files"" episode.",961718400,3,1822,5.582417582417582
751954,3,6303972969,"There really isn't much to this movie. Scully and Mulder ona case in Dallas, Texas looking for a bomb hidden in the federalbuilding there. The bomb, planted by agents of the evil FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), to destroy evidence of a kid and a few fireman who were infect by an alien virus. Right, let's be subtle about this, shall we? Let's not steal the bodies and destroy them, oh no, let's plant explosives in a very large and obvious fashion and nuke a building in a large metropolitan center. Good thinking, guys!
 There is no doubt a lot here for an X-Files fan, of which I would count myself one. It is an intelligent show to some degree, but after seven years of Scully being skeptical and Mulder being obsessive is getting a little redundant. What does work in the movie and has always worked in the TV series is the fact that Mulder and Scully are important to each other - more than just colleagues, more than just friends, but still not going to fall in love with each other - having them do so would be the same killing blow that sunk Moonlighting back in the eighties. The chemistry between the two is probably what keeps me coming back to the show.
 The movie does reveal some secrets, most of which are kept away from Scully even though she was there for most of it. Drugged unconscious and infected with the alien virus, Scully is captured and placed aboard an alien ship hidden in Antarctica and must be rescued by Mulder, (is anyone getting tired of Scully always being the victim? I know I am). Yes, there are real aliens and yes there is a conspiracy to cover them up while some very powerful men consort with them in order to save their own skins. But apparently the aliens are the native inhabitants to Earth and now want it back.
 I don't think this should have been a movie, but rather a two-parter or a season ender/opener for the series. It didn't reveal as much as the advertisements said it would, and unfortunately the truth is still out there. And now that Duchovny's contract has expired, he has shown no interest in resigning to the show, and I don't really blame him. The media hype and the drooling fangirls would be enough to turn anyone off that kind of exposure. There have been rumors of second film called X-Files: Invasion, but not much has been revealed. If it does happen and it is made, let's just hope it has a lot more meat on it than the first film did.",961718400,,2415,4.434684684684685

751960,2,6303972969,"My former roommate's girlfriend and I really like the TV show, ""The X-Files,"" especially the first couple of seasons. She was a really good friend of mine before I roomed with her boyfriend, so one time, I even  went with her to the X-Files convention to meet the ""Cancer  Man""(, formally known as Cigarette-Smoking Man, or CSM for short). Her  boyfriend was not as big of a fan of the show; however, and after almost  every episode, he would have the same frustrated complaint: ""This show  always leaves more questions than it does answer them."" I would always  have the same response: wait for the movie.
  You see, the series  creator Chris Carter promised that he would answer a lot of questions in  the movie several years ago, when he knew that there was going to be a big  screen production. So, my roommate, his girlfriend, myself and several  other thousand X-Files fans have been waiting anxiously for the release of  the new X-Files movie, ""The X-Files: Fight the Future.""  Naturally, Chris Carter (CC, for short) had to make a movie that would  satiate the cravings of his TV series fans; and he also wanted a movie that  would appeal to non-fans to create a new fan base. He apparently has failed  on both accounts.
  Initially, after seeing the movie, I thought  that the fans who have recently caught on to ""The X-Files"" trend  and newbies would like it better than diehard fans. But then I found out  that even the newer fans were disappointed. As it turns out, I now have the  same complaint as my former roommate: the movie and the series leave too  many questions unanswered, while dishing out some new ones. So, as a  result, the newer fans are left in the dark as to what the heck is going  on, and the older fans leave the theater grumbling, promising that they'll  never watch another episode of the paranoid conspiracy-driven TV show.
  David Duchovny's(DD) character, FBI Agent Fox Mulder, unsurprisingly  translates well to the screen; however, Gillian Anderson's(GA) character,  Agent Dana Scully is a weaker, whiny, immature version of the character on  the TV show--which is sad, because GA's acting is far superior than DD's in  the series. Give credit to DD, though. His self-mockery in the film is a  welcome bright spot in a film that tries too hard and takes itself too  seriously.
  Or, perhaps not seriously enough. Can a movie be both  predictable and unintelligible? Somehow, ""The X-Files"" film  manages to do just that. It answers questions that we already knew the  answer to. Yet, it ignores some extremely basic plot lines that die hard  fans all expected to find out the answer to: you don't find out what  happened to Mulder's sister; you don't find out what is going on with the  clones; you don't find out what is going on with the rebellion; you don't  find out what happened with the genius kid that was introduced in the  Season Five finale; you don't find out what happened to Alex Krycek; you  don't find out what has become of the bounty hunter/shape shifter; and you  don't find out if CSM is Mulder's dad. And for the people who don't care  about those questions because they don't watch the show, characters will be  introduced to you without introduction. Newbies that I have met have felt  like outsiders on an in-joke. For example, CSM would stand amidst  pandemonium, puffing away on his Marlboros, saying nothing, nothing said  about him. One viewer felt as if they were watching some strange,  superficial, art-house flick.
  The reason why ""The  X-Files"" works as a TV show is because CC is able to suspend your  disbelief for an hour or two; the scariest things are unseen; and the  chemistry between DD's loony cop and GA's scientific cop works. In the  movie, everything dies. The truth may be out there; but, it's not in this  movie. On the upswing, there is some beautiful camerawork, and some cool  special effects.

I  highly recommend this film to all x-philes, and I think any X-Files  ignorant person would also enjoy it.  But be prepared to think, this movie  requires a bit more attention than ""Independence Day"".",949017600,3,682,4.479674796747967

I'm sure most people interested in buying this video have some idea of the plot, etc. so I thought I would  write something useful for those trying to decided between widescreen vs.  pan and scan because I have seen both versions.  If you have a big tv, I  would definately reccomend the widescreen.  But if you have a smaller tv, I  would think twice about it because the widescreen is really narrow- much  more narrow than the ads, which are midway width-wise between the pan and  scan and widescreen versions.  It depends on what you are buying the video  for.  If you are a purist, or are buying it just for the ""bee  scene"" I would go with the widescreen (the bee scene is alot better on  widescreen), but if you are going for general action flick entertainment, I  would get the pan and scan version!

Bruckman  (played by the incomparable Peter Boyle) is a  middle-aged balding bachelor who recognizes life for the meaningless, empty  game it is...and never has a television character carried such wisdom in  every word, every gesture, every glance...  This episode alone should  warrant buying the video set  (the others are of high quality as well,  especially ""War of the Coprophages"", though I doubt the other  episodes will appeal much to people who haven't followed the complicated  mythology of the series).

752157,4,6303972969,"I saw this film on opening weekend in New York in a large, reserved-seating theater full of X-Files nuts and their friends--a wondrous experience, truly--and this probably colors my opinion of the film. The  knowledgeable, enthusiastic crowd loudly applauded the first sight of  Scully and Mulder, cheered Scully's authoritative line ""Don't think.  Just pick up that phone and make it happen."", and whistled at the  fade-in of the Lone Gunmen. The enthusiasm was most definitely contagious,  for though I walked into the theater liking the X-Files (my needful weekly  dose of weirdness in a conformist workplace), I walked out truly inspired  by that sense of the heroic that the best X-Files stories occasionally  capture.  Then I became an X-Files nut, too.  Lucky for me, the FX Network  began playing ""100 Nights of the X-Files"" shortly after the film  was released and I caught up with everything.
The gaps in logic did make  me wonder: how did Mulder get to the Antarctic, and without flying into  someone's radar? How did Dr. Kurtzweil know all that he knew, anyway? And  how convenient for Scully to miss seeing the--ahem!--significant object.  Though I like the film a bit less after viewing it several times on VHS,  the film does achieve the fine balance of attracting viewers new to the  X-Files as well providing a significant installment to the long-running  story line for well-established nuts. Many critics new to the series  appreciated the dynamic between the agents, as well as their fine,  intelligent, quirky humor, and remarked that they will begin watching the  series because of the film.
Parting words: to X-Files nuts, please leave  the stars alone and remember that it's the CHARACTERS you find appealing,  not the actors!  and savor the mystery as well as the answers. To the  X-Files creators, THANK YOU for having Scully say in the Nov. 28, 1999  episode that the first day of the new millennium will dawn on Jan. 1, 2001,  and not Jan. 1, 2000, as everyone else assumes.",945216000,7,2002,4.930930930930931
752158,2,6303972969,"Those who haven't seen the show before will find this movie to be totally confusing. Even X-philes will be perplexed about what the deal is. I became a fan of the show for many reasons- series creator Chris Carter's  unorthodox takes on society & myth, the acting of David Duchovney and  Gillian Anderson, and the show's quirky humor. This movie really doesn't  showcase any of those things.
For the movie Carter wrote a decent story  which never really breaks free from its moorings. The potential scope and  grandeur of the story is hinted at but never seen. While the directing is  decidedly second-rate, the music is quite good- appropriately dark and  moody. Anderson & Duchovney make what they can of Agents Mulder &  Scully, but the story too often leaves the Agents reacting to events more  than acting upon them.
The supporting cast is badly under-served as well.  While Martin Landau has some nice scenes as Mulder's latest informant, the  Lone Gunmen have little more than a cameo. Cigarette-Smoking Man &  Skinner (both complex characters important to the show) are both left with  small parts that are hardly relevant to the story. John Neville's  Well-Manicured Man may have the best role in the movie as the man who  brings Mulder closer to the truth than he has ever been.
Based on this  film, Fox's strategy of bringing the show onto the big screen seems fated  to failure.
Carter would do well to turn the screenwriting duties for his  next film over to X-Files scribe Vince Gillighan or even Duchovney, a  talented writer himself.",944265600,3,1549,4.821292775665399

The second episode,  ""Anasazi"" deals with the mythology and finds Mulder searching for  the truth about alien existence. ""Anasazi"" is also the season two  finale and the story continues into season three with ""The Blessing  Way/Paper Clip"". This X-Files video is a must for any fan of the show.

This, and  other puzzlers, such as why the FBI chose to ""place blame"" for  the explosion in the first scene on the people who actually found the bomb  and evacuated the building before it went off, are half the fun of this  film.
Although I'm an X-Phile, what was great about this movie is that  one didn't really have to be in order to enjoy it. It was visually  spectacular, the acting was great, the script had just the right mixture of  adventure and comic relief, and it was a jolly good ride.

752215,5,6303972969,"Even if you've never seen an X-Files episode, you will love this movie.  This movie has all the makings of a cult classic (just like the show). I did not watch the X-files show until after I saw the movie in 1998. Now I  am a X-Files watcher for life. It's nice to have a movie and TV show that  excites your intellect as well as your senses. Chris Carter has outdone  himself - David Duchovny is masterful in his portrayal of Special Agent Fox  Mulder, the ""Spooky"" yet brilliant agent in charge of the X-Files  (the cases the Bureau deems unsolvable and strange).  Gillian Anderson is  wonderful in her portrayal of Special Agent Dana Scully, the perfect  counterpart to Agent Mulder, he is mysterious in his personal life and has  his head in the clouds at times, she is a down to earth (unless she's been  abducted again) and no-nonsense agent that deep down loves the drama that  ensues everytime she goes on an assignment with her partner.  Yes, there is  a sexual overtone to certain parts of the movie, but in the show there are  sexual inuendos in every episode - Mulder and Scully are obviously in love,  but I agree with Chris Carter, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in  saying that the relationship MUST stay at a non-sexual level (at least  until the show is over) so don't expect Mulder and Scully to hop in the  sack in this movie - you will be disappointed if you do. Buy this!  The  script is even more interesting than the movie - it has lines and scenes  that were cut from the movie and you can see where David Duchovny does his  wonderful improvisation.  The film cells are interesting - just remember it  takes 16 frames of film to make one second of a movie - so don't expect to  see a scene from the movie.  Very nice, glossy 8x10 posters and the  ""Making of..."" Video is very insightful. Buy this collection -  you will not be sorry!",933724800,10,1862,4.410029498525073

With the ""Two-Fathers/One  Son"" two-parter in season 6, we have a complete detail of what is now  going on. I love the direction the movie sent the series in. And sure the  movie was like a long episode, but why fix something that isn't broken? We  should all have learned by now that a good X-files episode or movie should  not be rated on how satisfied we feel from the answers we were given,  rather it should be regarded as good when we are left with more questions  than answers.

The series has a quality currently lacking in most TV sf shows and films and continues to  fly the flag for good stories and storytelling. The film is no exception. I  was intrigued about the extra footage but disappointed that it amounted to  around a minute of exposition. However, that did not spoil the film.
This  has to be one of the best films of 1998 and I look forward to watching it  again.
The DVD transfer is excellent, one of the best I have seen. A  crisp clear print with good sound too. The extras were enjoyable,  especially a Making of feature which is longer than your average Making of  (about 40 minutes). Nice to see all the trailers too. Can't wait to hear  Chris Carter's commentary on the film - is the truth there?

I must say all around this is a very good movie since it is like  another episode but longer and has much better effects.  I like the way  that Well Manicured Man died too.  It was a good idea not to reveal too  much in this movie since you would not have too much to look forward to in  season 6, 7 or future movies.  It gives you more of your favorite  characters (mine at least): Mulder, Scully, Cigarette Smoking Man, Well  Manicured Man, the Elders, etc.  I was kind of disappointed that Scully  wouldn't look up to see the UFO, but that is her character and they stook  to it.

753395,4,6303972969,"Mulder and Scully transfer well to the big screen and the storyline continued well from the series. However non X-file fans may have a bit of a problem understanding what is going on. Also I would have liked to see some  of the other characters featured more ie the Lone Gunmen, Skinner and  Crycheck (did I spell that right) this was very much a Mulder Scully story.  Anyhow a job well done that advances the X-file story arc well.",916012800,,432,4.443037974683544

753554,5,6303972969,"I've watched and taped the X-Files since the very first episode in Oct. of '93. I'm one of the few X-Philes who can proudly say they have every episode of the X-Files on tape. This film was totally in keeping with the  series....of course that means some of the story was vague and cloaked in  mystery but then if it wasn't it wouldn't be the X-Files right? The story  starts in 35,000 BC with some Neanderthals encountering a E.B.E. in a  underground cave in Texas....then it cuts to Texas present day with some  kids encountering the ""black oil"". Then it moves on to a FBI  search for a bomb at a Federal building in Texas. I don't want to spoil it  so I'll just say the story takes us from there then to Washington and  finally to the climax in the Antarctic. Cancer Man is more a menacing  figure in the background then a main character...much like he was in the  first season. Martin Landau is good as a conspiracy nut and John Neville  has a strong presence in the film as the Well Manicured Man. Also any  doubts anyone might have had about Gillian Anderson's and David Duchovny's  film presence should be laid to rest. If you were looking forward to seeing  Mulder's butt or Scully's nude body covered in goo you'll be miffed because  thankfully they had the good taste to leave that to your imagination and  the much talked about ""kiss scene"" was done exactly the way it  should have been. On the downside they didn't answer many questions and  much of loose ends from the fith season where left well...loose but then if  they did tie up everything there wouldn't be much point to the sixth  season. My only real disappointments (and minor at that) where the fact  that the cool shape shifting bounty hunter(s?) and Krychek aka RatBoy were  no where to be seen. The Lone Gunmen do have one scene made memorable by a  great line of Mulder's. All in all I'd give it a 9 if your an X-File and a  6 if your not. I'm glad they added the part where WMM tells Mulder why his  sister was taken, they should have left it in the film in the first place.  Oh and one last thing....for some reason I had a gut feeling there would be  a Star Wars reference there was...... At the very end. Also if you have a  good size TV get this widescreen version. Be warned however it looks kind  of small on 25"" TVs or smaller. Just sit closer. :o) -Rob",912988800,,2338,4.32258064516129
753555,5,6303972969,From a ardent fan. Mulder and Scully were great together and the continuing saga was as clear as it will ever be... for now.,912729600,,124,4.208333333333333
753556,4,6303972969,"The X-Files movie is a good stand alone feature. One does not need to be an X-File fanatic, such as myself, to understand the plot. Although the movie left out some important issues that were raised in the season finaly  and through-out the whole series, it did do a nice job bridging the gap  between seasons to some extent. Unfortunately it did give some concrete  evidence to Moulder's theories. theories that being egnimatic helped fuel  the plot and concept of the show. Over all I felt it was a good movie that  kept your interest.",912384000,,537,4.610526315789474

For those new to the X-Files,  you may feel a sense of drowning - trying to keep your head above the plot.  That being said, the movie stands on its own and provides great  entertainment value to anyone from the hardcore X-Files junkie to your  parents.  <grin>",911347200,,508,4.629213483146067

I  NEVER DREAMED OF BEING THE LEAST BIT DIASSAPPOINTED - AND I WAS NOT. THANKS  TO THE STERN HAND OF CREATOR CHRIS CARTER AND HIS TEAM OF 'X-PERTS', THE  X-FILES IS A WEEKLY DOSE OF TELEVISION EXCELLENCE. STORIES THAT AMAZE AND  CONFUSE, CHARACTERS THAT TURN YOUR STOMACH AND TUG AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS,  AND BEST OF ALL,THE PRESENCE OF AGENTS FOX MULDER AND DANA SCULLY , WHO  WILL DRIVE YOU POSITIVELY INSANE BY THEIR ACTIONS - AND SOMETIMES BY THEIR  LACK OF ACTIONS. IF YOU WATCH FAITHFULLY, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT YOU  MUST MAKE THIS A PART OF YOUR COLLECTION - ALONG WITH ALL THE TELEVISED  EPISODES. BUT NEW VIEWERS NEED HAVE NO FEAR. "" THE X-FILES - FIGHT THE  FUTURE"" IS INFORMATIVE ENOUGH TO BE FOLLOWED AND ENJOYED BY EVEN THE  MOST INEXPERIENCED 'X' WATCHER. ADDED FOOTAGE INCLUDED ON THE VIDEO RELEASE  (BUT NEVER SHOWN IN THEATRES) CLEARS UP A QUESTION OR TWO, BUT AS WITH ALL  THE X-FILES, WITH EACH QUESTION ANSWERED, TWO MORE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED. IF  YOUR LOOKING TO ADD A MOVIE TO YOUR HOME LIBRARY, INSTEAD OF GIANT LIZZARDS  OR EARTH DESTROYING METEORS, OR DOCTORS WHO HOLD CONVERSATIONS WITH GUINEA  PIGS, PICK UP ""THE X-FILES"".
