2672711,4,B000JJSJA0,This one hits the human heart deeply. A must see for everyone to watch. This movie shows us all how human we all are and the wounds that we get and how they affect us. This is a perfect display of how someone would go about healing their wounds. It really spoke to me and the wounds that I've encountered in my life. Not the same as mine but it made me think of mine wounds and what I need to do to heal myself.,1213228800,2,411,3.847058823529412
2672712,3,B000JJSJA0,Have been a long time fan of Mark Thompson's radio program in LA.  Had no idea he was so talented.  Not only did he write this movie he starred in it as well and did a fine job!  A good watch.,1179273600,,192,3.6341463414634148
2672713,4,B000JJSJA0,"I originally purchased this DVD because I've been listening to Mark & Brian on the radio every morning for years and try to support their endeavors. I was courious to see what Mark Thompson had been up to in the screen writing and movie world.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed.

I was taken on a journey that brought me to laughter, tears and many thought provoking moments. Mark's acting was natural and very convincing.  I was also very impressed to see all the seasoned actors that were in this movie.  I really enjoyed it!",1179187200,6,546,4.597938144329897
2672714,5,B000JJSJA0,"Mother Ghost is one of those little movies that sneaks up on you and truely catches you by surprise. Looking at the cover you can see it is packed with actors that have been doing 'this' for awhile now and know their way around a set. With the exception of one, that being Mark Thompson. This movie is actually his brainchild, his blood, sweat and tears if you will. And after watching it you will never believe that this is his first starring turn in a movie. He has done tons of very small parts on various tv shows and movies, including his own tv show on NBC in the early 90's but he is probably more famous for his voice. He is one half of the Mark and Brian Radio Show eminating from Los Angeles and broadcasting over the US. The aforementioned show he starred in for NBC was The Adventures of Mark and Brian and was the very 1st, THE VERY FIRST, reality TV show. His acting, his performance is the one you will be talking about long after the credits have ended.",1173916800,10,969,4.243243243243243
2672715,5,B000JJSJA0,A very good movie for the whole family as well as children. The writer and lead actor in the film has adapted a more spiritual take on loving and letting go; the maturation of what love really is and how letting go frees the love inside us all so we can love ourselves as well as others.,1404864000,,287,4.052631578947368
2672716,5,B000JJSJA0,"Great movie.  This movie sneaks up on you.  When I started watching the movie, my first thoughts were maybe Mark should not have played the lead.  I know it is his movie but I was not buying into his acting.  Somewhere along the way I forgot about Mark's acting and was taken in by the story.  Even further along I found myself emotional and relating to the story.  This movie captures the feelings and emotions that a person goes through after losing a loved one but it does so in a subtle yet brilliant way.",1396828800,3,509,4.3052631578947365
2672717,5,B000JJSJA0,We enjoyed the movie. Mark you did a great job! Watch the commentary great stuff in there too! Can't wait for another mark and lynda production!!!,1388880000,,146,4.653846153846154
2672718,5,B000JJSJA0,I just love this movie . I did see it before on one of the cable station I was looking for it but they have not shown it recently I asked Mark whem we has on KLos he was at the yearly adoption at Eldorado park if it was a true story but he said no but I just wonder part of it is problaby true about his life Linda fusco,1382486400,,320,3.5211267605633805
2672719,4,B000JJSJA0,Great movie. Mark did a great job in writing and acting.  Has a great cast. Kevin made a good radio host.,1379980800,,105,4.0
2672720,5,B000JJSJA0,"Of a great Radio God (lol) ... I found this film by accident one night on Showtime.  The penultimate scene with Kevin Pollack shows that this man is not just a Radio God, but he also has some great acting skills.  I was blown away.  This movie I had to have in my library.",1366675200,,272,4.0
2672721,5,B000JJSJA0,This was a great movie.  Loaded with major actors with great talent.  The story had depth and was suspensful.  Mark Thomson is a great writer.  Can't wait to see 2:13.,1366070400,,167,4.466666666666667
2672722,5,B000JJSJA0,Great movie the wife and i were both in tears. Told many others and would reccomend to anyone who has a soul.,1363651200,2,109,4.0
2672723,5,B000JJSJA0,I expected a B type movie but was pleasently surprised! Mark takes time to build his character and hook you! Kevin Pollack is outstanding in his roll.,1363132800,,150,4.592592592592593
2672724,5,B000JJSJA0,Great movie. Not long enough. Deleted scenes were fun. Didn't know Mark Thompson had that talent in him. You go boy!,1362787200,,116,4.571428571428571
2672725,5,B000JJSJA0,We have been fans of the Mark and Brian show for years  we heard about this movie from the show and decided. To get it. The movie was above what we expected all emotions were felt. Highly recomend,1362700800,2,196,4.157894736842105
2672726,4,B000JJSJA0,"Watched this film last night with my husband, and we both cried a good deal. We still have our mothers, but our daughter died last year, so it was a hard film for us to watch in a way, because it was about letting go. That's hard to do when you lose someone who is very important to you. I was worried this was going to be some hokey ghost movie but I was so pleasantly surprised. I always have loved Dana Delaney, but had never seen the actor playing Keith before. I really liked him though. I really did, and when I discovered he also wrote the movie, I was touched and impressed.

This may not be your razzle dazzle sort of Hollywood movie that people seem to crave, this is a heartfelt movie that people need. We need to heal, so many of us, from grief. Too many of us try to push on like Keith and we alienate people because we don't even realize that we're hanging onto the past and to pain that is destructive. It's painful to let it go, but it's healthy.

This film was like a little trip to the psychiatrist for everyone who watched it, I think. Which isn't a bad thing. Better than a trip to the dentist!",1346544000,6,1114,4.129032258064516
2672727,4,B000JJSJA0,Really thought this movie would be about a ghost but it's really about memories. I have to admit this is one sad movie.  If you like a sad movie you will like this one. Just stick with it from the start.,1332374400,,203,3.951219512195122
2672728,1,B000JJSJA0,"This disc came out of my machine and went right into the garbage, where it belongs. Every single thing about this movie was lame, especially Mark whoever he is... And all the other reviewers on here really need to get lives if they think this crap was so spectacular.",1314144000,,267,4.469387755102041
2672729,5,B000JJSJA0,"I can't say enough about this wonderful movie.  I had not heard of this movie but caught it on one of my movie channels when checking upcoming movies and was floored by the acting, the story line, directing, everything!  I knew I had to get the DVD. It's a must see and especially poignant to anyone dealing with a loss, which is everyone at some point.  I admire how they tackled and portrayed this topic.  I have watched it several times since I purchased it and it feels the same way every time, heartwarming, heart wrenching, eye-opening with unbelievable acting.  All the actors did a wonderful job, but Mark Thompson's acting was riveting and filled with emotion and he made you feel that emotion and amazing veteran actor Kevin Pollak's acting was right-on as the psychiatrist, extremely touching.  It was an amazing movie, one I will never forget.  Fantastic!",1307145600,2,867,4.778523489932886
2672730,4,B000JJSJA0,ordered it so I could see the whole show and am glad I did. It is a tear jerker but worth while.,1295308800,,96,3.409090909090909
2672731,5,B000JJSJA0,I thought this was a very moving story and really enjoyed seeing Mark Thompson as the lead.  Great movie.,1280707200,2,105,4.526315789473684
2672732,4,B000JJSJA0,"cute story, interesting realizing that Mark Thompson, of Mark and Brian, did this. Mark knows how to capture the true meaning of life.",1266278400,,134,4.869565217391305
2672733,5,B000JJSJA0,"Mother Ghost was a great story with some pretty good acting, expecially from Mark Thompson, who happens to be half of a morning radio show here in Los Angeles.

It tells us to put aside our differences with our parents and enjoy them while they are still with us.  I think we can all learn from that bit of advice.",1265155200,2,314,4.216666666666667
2672734,5,B000JJSJA0,"This is an absolute amazing movie...I can't say enough!  I am passing this around to everyone I know insisting they watch it...When they do they cannot believe how amazing it is!  Like others, I've been a long-time listener of Mark & Brian and was surprised to learn of this endeavor by Mark Thompson, just the other day.  I must say that Mark was absolutely incredible with his performance in this movie, let alone creating it!!  I recently lost my beloved Father, way before his time, and this movie was SO inspiriing for my Mother (wife of 42yrs) and myself.  Even if you haven't lost the most important, loving person in your life, you'll ADORE & CHERISH this movie...it's theme, message and acting!!  My word Mark, who knew you were THIS talented?!! I pray we all get to see MUCH more from and OF YOU in the movies!!!!!!",1213920000,8,825,4.578231292517007

8151028,5,B000JJSJA0,"I wasn't sure what to expect - the reviews were sort of ""mixed"". I watched it on amazon video (I had never heard of it before). I thought the movie was well done. (good cast)  I thought it was uplifting - some laughs, some tears. Let's face it, we all have unresolved issues (with parents), even if we don't think so. And grief is a difficult thing to deal with as well. I thought the movie dealt with that in a nice way.",1492905600,,421,4.072289156626506
8151029,2,B000JJSJA0,Great message but poor delivery.,1480636800,,32,5.6

8151031,5,B000JJSJA0,"I watched this movie on TV several years ago, and loved it then. I watched it again today  and felt compelled to write a review on it because it's such a great story . I almost didn't watch it the first time because of the name. I don't usually go in for ghost stories. This however was much more than that. It was a story of a man's deep grieving for his dead mother and his painful past with his withdrawn and even cruel father.  The psychological tricks that his mind played on him when he tried to hold down the grief that was consuming him, and the very believable help he receives from a failing radio talk show psychiatrist made for a powerful movie.

The story starts with a man who is obviously on a fast track to alcoholism and divorce, whose best friend and his wife are both telling him he needs to get help. You don't really know why, except that they mention he's just not right.  Then you find out he says he found his dead mother's wedding rings on the sink ... Although she was buried wearing them. There are a lot of scenes where things seem to be appearing and disappearing, and mysterious female figures seem to appear and disappear... which I suppose is the ghost part of it.  At first it was a little disconcerting because I didn't understand, but as the story progressed, you understood that he was being overwhelmed by trying to hold it together, and his mind was driving him to face his feeling...or else fall further into depression and maybe insanity.

Fortunately, he is drawn into calling a talk show psychiatrist, who through a great job of counseling, gets him to open up about the loss of his mother, and the pain of his childhood and a nearly abusive father.  Lol.  When I read that back, it certainly didn't sound like anything I want to watch. Fortunately, there was plenty of comic relief to lead you along this enlightening path with the very likable man.

The movie is like being able to sit in on a counseling session of someone while enjoying the voyeurism of seeing his wife, his father, and numerous strangers listening in on the session.

I laughed many times in this movie, and cried just about as many. Believe me, this is no action thriller, or lame ghost story. Instead it's an hour long trip into the human psyche, with some Hollywood theatrics thrown in.

All in all, I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.  Apparently the writer of the script and the lead actor in this movie is a talk show host on some Los Angeles radio show. Being from Florida, I've never heard of him, but I would love to watch any other movie he decided to undertake.  If you enjoy digging into psycological issues, or if you are struggling with the loss of a loved one, I think you'll love this movie. Maybe not for everybody, but for me it's a 10 out of 10!",1455235200,4,2781,4.408203125
8151032,5,B000JJSJA0,"Great movie especially if your a Fan of Mark and Brian (KLOS),  Mark in the Morning (100.3 the Sound),  or the Mark and Lynda Podcast",1436745600,,133,4.28
