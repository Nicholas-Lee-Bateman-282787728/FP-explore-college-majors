1867766,5,B00008YJCB,I love Midsomer Murders. When I could no longer get it on TV I began ordering them in DVD format and I love them! It's wonderful to be able to watch them whenever I please. This seller is great. Good customer service and prompt mailing. High recommendation for both the movie and seller.,1245715200,3,287,4.433962264150943
1867767,5,B00008YJCB,"Well cast and written. Easy to follow, lots of twists and turns. Very surprise ending,totally unexpected. John Nettles plays his part well, with natural human reactions and yet he isn't one of the many super-detectives. In short, he relates well to the viewer. The viewer can follow his line of thought. His relationship with his partner is honest, respectful, and seems true to life. Everyone was well cast, and I especially enjoy watching many of the older actors.",1120867200,14,466,4.987179487179487

7988001,5,B00008YJCB,"I bought this lone episode from the long running British TV series, Midsomer Murders, to see what they were like and if they were worth considering as a whole (price notwithstanding).  If this episode is any indication of their overall quality, I'd have to say I'd just found another series to invest in (which is both good and bad: price notwithstanding!).
The mystery of Death's Shadow was intriguing enough to hold my interest throughout, the lead characters were a very engaging team (none of the usual bickering expected in American police procedurals).  There were plenty of suspicious suspects and a suitably gruesome series of murders.  The first victim was a man with a brain tumor who soon loses his head.  I liked that the clues seemed to move in several directions at the same time.  Even if you don't like mysteries per se, the story and characters were fascinating in and of themselves to make this worthwhile viewing.",1369612800,2,932,4.8734177215189876
7988002,3,B00008YJCB,Well I haven't watched this yet but i just wanted to say that is got scraches all over the dvd.. I hope this play cause i bought for my mother.. thats why the 3 star rating at this time i will leave more feed back later.,1366243200,,220,3.8043478260869565
7988003,5,B00008YJCB,I am a huge fan of British mysteries and can't get enough of DCI Barnaby and the family. Cully is great.,1358467200,,104,4.0
7988004,3,B00008YJCB,"The scenery and architecture of this village was so pretty and serene, yet the crime was so appalling gory. The plot seemed a bit incredible. I'm unsure how I feel about this show; I've never seen Midsomer Murders before this. Apparently this program is always highly rated and thought highly of, but based on this episode, I'm not sure I'm interested.",1279670400,,352,4.786885245901639
7988005,4,B00008YJCB,"The quality of British acting and film production puts, in this case, per ususal, American ""works"" to utter shame. The level of Midsomer is, due to escapism and snobbery implicit in the milieu, the characters, their activities and even the way they speak, below that of, say, A Touch of Frost, a truly excellent show and series. I still would recommend the programs in Midsomer Murders, but with the caveat that, going by the product descriptions on Amazon, frequently deficient if not plain wrong, the purchaser is likely to be disappointed. In this case,in the show, Death's Shadow, which I recently saw, there is NO Prunella Scales to be found. Beware of product descriptions!!!!!!!!!",1265068800,,687,5.035087719298246
