8602776,1,B00E8ZWK7O,Poor quality and the repeating of the same clips with different commentary was annoying. Nothing new was said or learned. The tapes of the presidents talking etc were interesting. The most remarkable part of the film was the speech by Hillary....wow...she sounded great and like a potential president candidate...what happened to her?????,1522972800,,338,5.519230769230769

8602780,3,B00E8ZWK7O,"This DVD does not break any new ground about Osama bin Laden. It may be most suitable for younger viewers who do not remember the
terror events of the 1990s and early 2000s first hand, or someone who needs a refresher on the events.  The video starts and ends with his capture, and long speeches (too long) by various politicians.
The middle part is most interesting as it explains how the terror camps in Afghanistan had their roots way back in the late 1970s, and how bin Laden gained followers and staged terror attacks in Africa and other parts of the Middle East.  These attacks eventually led to the Sept. 11, 2001 event that triggered a U.S. military response and the 10-year hunt for bin Laden.",1448409600,,702,4.563492063492063
