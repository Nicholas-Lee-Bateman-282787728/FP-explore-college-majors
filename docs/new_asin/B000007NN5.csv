7905038,3,B000007NN5,"Prince Daaker AKA Captain Nemo has searched 20,000 leagues under the sea for revenge. The daughter of Prince Daaker (Lois Alexander) was abducted. Prof. Aronnax (Dan Hanlon) is invited by the US navy to track sown a sea monster that is interrupting shopping. He takes his daughter (Edna Pendleton). A balloon is blown off course and carries four men to the south pacific. An evil yacht owner looks for a girl from his past. All of these stories and the story of a Child of Nature in a chic leopard skin outfit will converge on a mysterious island for the final scenario.

We find this version of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea quite different from the Disney version. The special effects are more vantage and they spend more time explaining how the physics of the underwater suits, crystal ""magic window"", and underwater guns, work.

There are a few things that one must take in account for the times. Nemo looks like a goat herder. The giant octopus looks much more like the octopus in the John Wayne move Wake of the Red Witch. The underwater guns look like Winchester lever action. Where did the Child of Nature get her leopard skin? How did Nemo obtain his technology? Not the most plausible story.

There is also a long long under water filler scene. However there is excellent underwater photography by the brothers George and Ernest Williamson.

Other than that is fun to watch.",1508112000,,1382,4.698347107438017
7905039,3,B000007NN5,"This 1916 silent movie is actually a combination of Jules Verne's ""Mysterious Island"" and ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea"".  The grand scope of the books has been necessarily condensed, but the  resulting tale is consistent, and important elements of the original works  remain recognizable. One of the exclusively male characters in each of  Verne's stories are women in the film and the combined plots are adjusted  accordingly.  Some of visuals and even Nemo's look are modeled after the  Hildibrand engravings in the 19th century Verne editions. The underwater  sequences are usually cited as an important breakthrough for cinema.  The  scenes showing sea life and divers walking on the sea floor are quite  impressive but the Nautilus model looks very toy-like.  I personally like  the 1910s naivete of the film, particularly the amusing ""child of  nature"" sequences on the island.  To a modern viewer the whole film  has a certain charm.  It is worth viewing for its historical value and as  an interpretation of Verne's work.  It is a significant addition to any  Jules Verne collection.",911433600,,1092,5.131428571428572
