2240654,4,B0007TKH66,"As a long-time Trekkie from the original run in the 60s, I recommend ""Enterprise"" highly. Ignore the fashionable negativity. This prequel series has a great cast, lovable characters and a nice frontier feel to the stories. I'm pre-ordering this set today. Support ""Star Trek"" and support ""Enterprise."" You won't be sorry.",1109203200,12,321,5.313725490196078
2240655,5,B0007TKH66,"I have seen virtually every single episode and I safely can say this is the best series since Deep Space Nine. This is how things were and why they are this way in the present. Even why Klingons did not use foreheads in the Original Star Trek. It took three seasons to developed these characters and seasons 3rd and 4th are the finest. Scott Bakula really put a lot of love for those trekkies. It will be a shame for UPN or Viacom not to continue this delightful well written saga (now with Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens for God's sake!). I agree that they wouldn't be in business today if it weren't for the past 39 years of Star Trek.

It's on my wish list now if any wonderful people out there want to send it to me.  Otherwise, the first chance I get, it's MINE!!!

2240657,5,B0007TKH66,"Now that UPN has cancelled Enterprise, hopefully a strong DVD sale will change TPTB's minds to produce a fifth season of this good show that is only getting better. Every Trek spin-off had a few bad seasons before finding their footing and the same goes for ENT. Give it a chance, it really is a great show!!",1108598400,14,308,4.421052631578948
2240658,1,B0007TKH66,"This has to be the most dumbed down, contrived and utterly bad written Star Trek I have ever seen. For anyone who has ever seen the original Star Trek from the 70's, it is almost shameful. Gene Roddenberry would turn in his grave. I don't blame the actors necessarily, but Scott Bakula and Jolene Blalock either didn't get the direction or they blew it. Scott Bakula more so. I blame the scriptwriters, who if I had to guess were 13-year-olds. The reason I am so mad is that this had the potential to be so much better with so little effort. The cast was fine, I guess. I blame the director and the scriptwriters for this disaster. Next time make Alfie goes to the moon. Imagine a 50-year-old TV series on an austerity budget being superior.

2240677,4,B0007TKH66,"After several successful Star Trek series that reach farther into the future (TNG) and farther out into the galaxy (Voyager), it makes perfect sense to create a new series to fill in the backstory. There is so much to like I hardly know where to start. The opening sequence skips the trumpet fanfare and whooshing spacecraft. In its place is a thoughtfully curated montage of the historical images (and some video) of human exploration. Im not crazy about the Bon Jovi style soundtrack that goes with it, but the images including Amelia Earhart, Gus Grissom (I think) and a Mars rover convey the spirit of the series very well.

The series seems to have been cast to reflect youth and vitality, echoing the impression the humans of Earth project in the galaxy. Hoshi, Travis, Malcom, and Trip all skew young. There are no wise sages, no grizzled veterans. Even TPol is on the young side for a Vulcan officer.

The 90-minute opener  Broken Bow  sets the table and fixes an initial reference frame for viewers who come to the Enterprise series with the future of the other Star Trek series firmly in mind. There is no United Federation of Planets, no Prime Directive. New technology in the opening episode includes the Warp 5 engine, the transporter, the phase pistol and targeting scanners. Even the Vulcan advisors are not the calm Vulcans of the future, but are instead still in the process of fully controlling their emotions. In this series Vulcans get mad, tell the occasional lie and harbor grudges over perceived wrongs. The opener introduces a new foe (the Suliban) and a new conflict (the temporal cold war) that set up good storytelling arcs for Season 1.

There is a wry sense of humor in the writing that at times is exceptionally subtle. For example, Earth discovers the Klingon race when a UFO crashes in a farmers corn field in Oklahoma. Naturally, the farmer grabs his rifle and opens fire.

Many of the episodes in Season 1 include a small side story about the discovery of technology that was well known by the time of TOS or TNG. The discovery stories are like easter eggs in a video game  a fun extra for the more observant viewer, but not necessary to follow the plot. There is even an interesting twist to the story of the first red shirt who has a line and an away team assignment.

Because so much of the Star Trek first contact story is already known, there is less background that needs to be dealt with by the writers in the early episodes. This produces more than the usual number of good episodes in the first season. The best include:

Episode 2  Fight or Flight - Ship of dead aliens brings story of respect and care for the deceased. Expression of Earth value of family/community. Good tension between TPol and Archer as metaphor for Vulcan/Earth cultural disconnect.

Episode 6  The Andorian Incident - A welcome appearance by Jeffrey Combs (Wayoun from DS9) as Shran the Andorian Commander. Appealing story line that reinforces Capt. Archers distrust of the Vulcans  showing them to be not as enlightened and honorable as in later Star Trek series. The incident appears to be setting up inner conflict for TPol as well.

Episode 13  Dear Doctor - The origin story for the Prime Directive. Rich in detail. The doctors letter plot format has been used in Star Trek franchises before (Voyager) and reaches as far back as MASH episodes in the 70s. This one works because the observations and insights are so keen. A subtle criticism of escapist movies, anthropomorphizing pets, etc. but at the same time showing admiration for the depth of empathy and inclination toward charity. Upholding the best of human values. The doctor defends evolution, faces and resolves fundamental issues about medical sciences potential to intervene in the natural order.

Episode 16  Fusion - thrilling encounter with Vulcan dissidents who challenge Vulcan dogma and question whether Vucan history is being accurately portrayed. This is proof of the intent to build a story arc for Vulcan history alongside Earth history. Three well written and played Vulcan characters. Good B story on family and regrets.

Episode 22  Fallen Hero  A strong story about how diplomacy can be effective to build relationships between planets (nations). Ostensibly a story about investigating corruption in a foreign society, the story is really about TPol, Archer and a Vulcan Ambassador learning to trust each other. Sometimes a feeling is more real when someone has the courage to say it out loud.

There are a few clunkers too. Episodes that are either too derivative of prior series (Shuttlepod 1, Rogue Planet, Oasis, Vox Sola) or just not enough to sustain interest (Terra Nova, Breaking the Ice, Two Days and Two Nights)

 Star Trek Enterprise is every bit as good as the other series in the Star Trek franchise. Dont let the lack of initial commercial success fool you.",1506211200,,4869,4.832731648616125
2240678,3,B0007TKH66,"I love the series, but this particular set leaves something to be desired. The menu is awkward, and only ONE of the episodes appears to be encrypted, so I couldn't play THAT EPISODE with VLC media player. What I got was a grey field with random colored blocks. I had to use windows media player. I'd almost say this could be bootlegged - a nice looking bootleg, but still not what I expected. I didn't have this problem with other TV series discs I've ordered. I'll be looking for the other years from another source.",1505433600,,517,4.4526315789473685
2240679,5,B0007TKH66,"By far a  great series of first deep space adventures. Turns out the human
race is a unifying force after much trial and tribulation. Makes a good case
for the Vulcan hands off logic, because of the general violent paranoia of the Galaxy
warp drive capable species. The pivotal character has to be the ultra sexy
Vulcan female science officer, T'pol. Her perplexity is portrayed masterfully
by her facial expressions alone. The ships doctor, Phlox, the only other
alien on board is another masterful touch.

The main plot line of the temporal cold war
and the Xindi/Suliban adversaries is interwove with plenty of very interesting
encounters of other species and problems. In total these first encounters of our
nearest galactic neighbors is worryingly familiar and filled with moral and ethical
ambiguity which ultimately begins and ends with Captain and science
officer T'pol in a friendship like Kirk and Spock.

Highly satisfying and worthy of many repeated viewings for years to come.
Especially in the near future when we actually ARE capable of FTL travel.
Which I firmly believe is technologically achievable.
Why? How? See, sail boats that sail faster than the wind in the America's Cup
for starters and a clue. The anti matter power sources have already been
tested and proven this Century at the CERN facility in Switzerland and
quantum field mechanics  and containment fields are on the horizon.

Most importantly, ultra safe long wave nuclear power reactors are poised
to end our miserable carbon based environmental problems. With limitless
safe electricity, scarcity and paranoia over energy resources will effectively end.
LIDAR technology alone has mapped the visible and invisible universe
and exposed virtually an unlimited view of every conceivable resource necessary
in mass quantities right here inside the Earth itself. The future of humanity
is as bright as Star Trek Enterprise.",1502409600,,1903,5.246710526315789

2240683,5,B0007TKH66,"This is my favorite Star Trek, I have never really been a fan of any of the shows but I really enjoy this series I have watched it all the way thru 4 times now.  Archer, Malcolm, Tucker all 3 bother me with there acting, tho in Dominic Keating's (Malcolm) defense I think he was miss cast. I think they should of swapped Tucker and Malcolm's roles. I think everything else about the show is great and some of the actors r great, like t'pol, Dr flaux, the Andorians. I enjoy all the episodes, they are all very exciting and well done as far as sci fi goes. All of the other star trek the aliens are all dudes in costumes to me, they all just real cheesy this is the only one I really feel like all the aliens are somewhat believable.  They ended the series in a cool way season 4 as well.  If u want some happy go lucky laid back sci fi to binge watch give it a try, just try to overlook those 3 characters they grow on you eventually lol.  I've watched Scott bakula in some public speaking stuff on u tube comic con videos, he's actually a great speaker if he would of played Archer more like himself in reality I think it would of made for a better character instead he made Archer kind of a whiney childish bitch.",1500940800,,1215,4.113924050632911
2240684,4,B0007TKH66,"It seems fitting I should write  this review at this time considering tomorrow is the 48th anniversary of Neil Armstrong becoming the first person from Planet Earth  to set foot on another celestial body.  I was in high school at the time and was paeticularly blessed to have witnessed the whole program thus far.  I mention this because this is the underlying premise of this series, this is part of the mythos of Star Trek.  I am aware of the negative criticisms of this series, but I don't seem to share those sentiments.  I  chalk that up to possibly an overall burnout of the series in general.  Following the original series, there was a 10 year gap to the first motion picture.  Fans of the show and newbies as well swelled with anticipation until Star Trek the Motion Picture was released in 1979, 1980, but once that event was realized there wasn't a moment of rest for the crews of the various iteratuons of Enterprise and the other starship classes that were designed as a result.  I had just started 8th grade when the original series hit the airwaves and amazingly a TV show that ran for a scant 3 seasons spawned this entire story, one possible story of our future.  This is what draws me to the world of Star Trek, the underlying mythos that was created to explain our civilization from this century and beyond.  Watching the original series we were introduced to James T Kirk and his crew.  We encountered warp drive and the ever useful transporter, but we never got a look at the earth of the 23rd century, this is what the show lacked, a look at the mythos underlying the development of the technological marvels we saw on screen.

OK, I'm not trying to review the original series, but the point is, this series does exactly what was lacking from the original series and all subsequent iterations.  This show examines the underlying mythos, how this future came to be.  You must be familiar with the Next Gen movie First Contact as a starting point.  This series builds on that and moves it along.  I've not said much about the stoylines, or acting etc. because that has all been said in other reviews, either good or bad, but I believe if you want to understand how we got from First Contact to the Enterprise crew we all.originally knew, this is the place to be.  This show reflects our human kind spirit of exploration.  The crew of this Enterprise are the Columbus's, the Magellans, Commodore Perry and Roald Amundsen's of their time.  They are taking those first steps into the cosmos as reoresentatives of Planet Earth.  They are introducing humanity to a plethora of civilizations that have never seen us before.  Also, they have given us a look at how we got there.  For my interest, it has given me the look at the mythos which confirms and enhances my theories on how this future developed.  So if you want to fill in the gap the period is 90 years after First Contact and 100 years pre-Kirk.  This look shows that humanity makes it and we do have a chance at a future much better than what is depicted in other futuristic programs.",1500422400,2,3060,4.548446069469835

2240687,3,B0007TKH66,"I've been a Star trek fan for decades, but there is a lot of bad writing in this series. I watched most of the series back when it first came out. It was pretty good, but since then I've gotten more sophisticated, I guess you could say.

I'm not going to go on on on, but this is an example of lazy script writing, and even bad writing:

Episode 10. The captain shoots a future device out of the Suliban's hand, because he didn't want the Suliban to have it. Logic 101: He could have stunned the Suliban and gotten both the device back and the Suliban.",1496275200,,552,4.149532710280374

I rate this series as number two  in the pantheon of trek series.",1493683200,2,339,4.333333333333333
2240689,2,B0007TKH66,"After binge-watching one of the best Star Trek series, Deep Space 9, I began watching this.  The Pilot is fairly good and the premise had me interested.  The second episode, however, despite another interesting premise, was nearly unwatchable.  The writing is terrible, and most of the cast is sub-par, particularly Bakula.  I was actually rooting against his character - the only characters I have liked so far are aliens - T'Pol the Vulcan and Doctor Phlox (whatever he is).  Blalock did a good job as a Vulcan and offers the best performance in the series I've seen so far.

The humans are just the most annoying thing in this show.  They come off as the most unprofessional jackasses, I just can't even believe they've been given command of earth's first starship.  Their behaviour is downright juvenile.

Finally, the theme song departs from the Star Trek classic style, which is okay in itself, but the song they chose is painful (your mileage may vary here).",1493683200,,965,4.835365853658536

It is well told in a chronological order so it is important to see the movie ""chapters"" in order.  Some limitations include all but one life form being a humanoid or humanoid-like appearance.  Biggest limitation remains true to the original series that the Captain and Engineer are usually on the landing party.....very high risk and not traditional leadership by any means but this is a technique to keep the ""stars"" in the limelight.  It is good to see many of the crew in space suits when not onboard the Enterprise.  The themes are not quite as blatant current human social issues portrayed in the future like the original series.  The characters are well developed with strengths and flaws as the series continues.

He has to reaffirm his authority all the time by saying ""that's an order"". No wonder he has to say that all the time, he doesn't act like he is in charge. Look at Picard, Janeway, or Sisko, those actors portray  their characters as someone that has a right to be there. I always liked watching TNG, DS9, and Voyager because they portrayed a sense of honor and ethics. Not this captain, he's running around murdering clones of his crew to harvest parts, stealing stuff and stranding other star ships, then acts all self sacrificial putting their missions in jeopardy, all while pouting like a child when he doesn't get his way.

The tried to hard to make it techy without being able to use tech as advanced as the future Star Trek shows had already displayed. They were forced to rely on interpersonal intrigue to get the show moving and the writers were not up the the task. The cast was great they just did not have a quality script to work with.,1486425600,,427,4.095238095238095

2240712,5,B0007TKH66,One of my favorite Star Trek TV series...great story lines and as with all the other Star Trek series they connect with the Star Trek history and story lines...good special effects too...,1486252800,,187,4.875
2240713,4,B0007TKH66,It's great to see Scott Bakula as a Captain of his own star ship. This series kinda reminds me of the original series of Star Trek starring William Shatner. This was not a bad series. I wish they did a little bit more with the direction but not too bad. I thought Scott was a great actor in this series. Probably one of his best Sci-fi flicks besides Quantum Leap.,1486166400,,364,4.214285714285714

2240716,4,B0007TKH66,Story lines are reminiscent of the original Star Trek.  Many being small morality plays.  My son is enjoying the chance to watch it.,1486166400,,132,4.695652173913044
2240717,5,B0007TKH66,"I'm not sure why, but this has ended up being one of my most favorite entries into the Star Trek catalogue. I love TOS, TNG, and can certainly sit through both DSN, and Voyager. But the characters in this show are so well done for the segment of time it takes place in. The feel of the over-arching Vulcan empire that effectively has neutered Star Fleet, is reflected in the relationship between Archer and T'Pol, the characters of Malcolm and Trip are as interesting as any I can recall from Kirk to Odo; and seem to generate an atmosphere of believability to the whole thing. That being said, this isn't Star Trek rehashed, it doesn't try to be such. It is a new take on the whole series; while keeping Roddenberry's main ideas in hand, it has elevated (IMHO) the craft required to make a good Sci-Fi show for the modern audience, but that is it's ultimate problem as well; it won't be remembered for causing that bar to be moved up.

I love this show, I think Archer is an interesting and well-written character, and there's really no episodes I want to skip even while re-watching this with my roomie. Each is memorable as an incapsulated whole, and each also plays into a operatic journey that leads to the Federation we all know and love. It is Star Trek in thought, and still plays with the ideals, notions, moral dilemmas, character evolution, and human advancement issues of the older series; but the crew feels more vulnerable and relatable to me.

Picard wasn't relatable to me, he sometimes felt superhuman; ditto Kirk. Archer, however; the main founder of the Federation, is about as neat and interesting a man as I imagined him when reading about Roddenberry's world in my early teens.

2240913,5,B0007TKH66,"As a Star Trek fan, I've seen all the different series; each one has it's own set of characters and story lines. Enterprise is special to me, for it shows how Star Fleet began. Before there was such a thing as simply beaming to a planet, raising shields, instant medical healing, tractor beams or Data to save the entire crew. This crew had to learn the hard way and figure things out on their own. They were not in a massive flag ship that outguns most of the galaxy... they were new explorers on the Kon Tikki. Scott Bakula does a fantastic job as the first to captain a space-traveling Enterprise. With a smaller ship, crew and database of knowledge to go on, they truly do go bravely into the unknown. Some people didn't like this show as much, unfairly in my opinion. Give this a chance to tell its story to you. You'll appreciate all the other Star Trek series even more as you'll know what it took to get there.",1480636800,5,918,4.343023255813954

2241004,3,B0007TKH66,"AD 2151. Earth has spent a century recovering from a devastating global war and developing new technologies, such as the ability to travel faster than light through Zephram Cochrane's warp drive. The alien Vulcans have taken taken humanity under their wing, seeing in them great potential but also great dangers linked to their rashness. Now Starfleet's first Warp 5-capable starship, the NX-01 Enterprise, is ready for launch under the command of Jonathan Archer. But the Vulcans are still uncertain about their allies and place one of their own on board to monitor events.

Back in 2001 Star Trek was suffering from a bad case of ""franchise fatigue"". Rick Berman had produced 21 seasons of television, none shorter than 20 episodes, spanning three different series in fourteen years. His feeling was that the franchise needed to be rested to come back stronger, but Paramount were adamant that they wanted to keep the Star Trek gravy train afloat. Wearily, Berman and Voyager producer Brannon Braga agreed to create a new show but only on the condition that they could be more experimental and bold with it.

The result was Enterprise, a prequel series set 115 years before Captain James T. Kirk's original five-year mission, and about 90 years after the time travel events of the movie Star Trek: First Contact. The idea was to strip away all of Star Trek's convenient and ""easy"" technology - the transporter, photon torpedoes, shields, the universal translator, replicators - and make something much grittier and more ""real"", with less pure and ideologically-motivated humans and the making of space into a much darker and more threatening place.

It's a nice idea which, intermittently, works. Enterprise's main problem in this first season is that it kind of pulls its punches. Not as much as Voyager did, but still a lot more than it should. Enterprise doesn't have shields, but instead it can ""polarise the hull plating"". It doesn't have torpedoes but it does have missiles which are almost as good. It does have a transporter, but it's ""risky"" to use (albeit it works perfectly when the script needs it to and not when it doesn't). The universal translator is an advanced version of Google Translate and about as reliable, but they have a linguistics genius on board who can straighten it out, so that's fine. All of the less-than-scientific facets of the Star Trek universe - artificial gravity and sound in space most notably - remain intact.

Still, Enterprise remains a big improvement over Voyager. The show deliberately hearkens back to the original series's sense of adventure, with Archer as a bold, curious scientific explorer (who's not afraid to get his hands dirty when needed) in Captain Kirk's mould. It's also fun to see what mischief the crew can get up to without the Prime Directive holding them back (even though by the end of the season the need for it becomes clear). Unlike Voyager's crew of dysfunctional, depressed bores, this crew is a bit livelier and funnier, with a generally much higher standard of acting ability (Dominic Keating being the weakest link, and he improves significantly as the season progresses). Scott Bakula, possibly the most likable person on Earth, makes for a great captain, Jolene Blalock overcomes some dubious costuming choices to deliver a smart and nuanced performance (her deadpan sense of humour comes more to the fore in later episodes) and Linda Park is great - if not given enough to do - as linguistics expert Hoshi. Connor Trinneer's engineer (who seems to be a mash-up of Scotty's engineering genius and McCoy's Southern charm) Trip is less interesting but kind of harmless. Anthony Montgomery's Travis probably gets the rawest deal in terms of having anything to do. The strongest performance on the show is given by John Billingsley as Dr. Phlox. Early fears that he might be Neelix Mk. 2 never materialise and he goes on to give a nuanced performance throughout the season (apart from a comedy plotline in which he is woken up early from his annual hibernation, which is irritating).

Enterprise may be better than Voyager at this early showing, but that certainly doesn't make it perfect. Individual episodes vary immensely in quality, with some very strong and entertaining episodes like Dear Doctor and The Andorian Incident having to make up for a lot of typical, semi-Star Trek filler pap. For a first season, Enterprise tests its viewers' patience a lot. Maybe not as much as the first seasons of TNG and Voyager, but there's a still an fair bit of tedium to get through to get to the good moments.

More questionable is the insertion of a storyline in which time-travelling operatives from the far future are engaged in a ""temporal cold war"" with one another. Having a Star Trek prequel series building naturally to the universe we know is a good idea. Having one in which some guy from the 31st Century shows up and tells Archer that he's special and his actions will lead to the founding of the Federation is a lazy shortcut. The main alien race in this storyline, the Suliban, is also not one of Star Trek's more interesting antagonist races, it has to be said.

But, ultimately, Enterprise ends up being diverting and entertaining. It's also interesting as a historical artifact: shortly after this season began, 9/11 took place and American SF took a turn for the darker and more cynical. That gave us some great TV like the new Battlestar Galactica, but it also may have taken things down too dark a path. Enterprise's overwhelming feeling of optimism, adventure and exploration is, when done well, a refreshing tonic to the grimness that would come after it.

The first season of Star Trek: Enterprise (***) is watchable, harmless and occasionally very cheesy fun. It's not the franchise at its best, but it's a long way from it at its worst. It does have a lot of potential, but it needs to up its game in future seasons.",1477180800,,5911,4.898101898101898

The writers laced the first season with many 'easter eggs' which explain how certain concepts and technologies evolved from the space flight into the era started by the original Star Trek series. One of the more brilliant bits of writing explains why the Klingons of the original series had flat foreheads versus the ridged foreheads that would follow in the subsequent TV series and movies.

2241246,5,B0007TKH66,I really like the show. Years ago I tried watching an episode midseason and it didn't click with me but this time I started watching it from the pilot and I realize now that this is essential. In order to understand the characters and their relationships it is important to have watched the pilot and watch the episodes in chronological order if possible. I am on season 3 now and am thoroughly enjoying the show.,1474243200,,413,4.52

The old technology from the original series is used, plus a few new things that could've been possible in the Era. I've enjoyed seeing how first contact with various creatures has gone, especially with some who are allies in later series but are not with Captain Kirk and this gives a glimpse into their back-story. Anyway, if you like Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation, you'll probably really enjoy this series!!!",1474156800,2,571,4.607843137254902

This series have it all, not too funny, not too serious and just enough action (can be a bit cheesy). The premise of meeting new civilizations or new species is here. Exploring new strange worlds is also here and everything is not too perfect, the new ship has problems, they don't have the right equipment, they aren't dressed  too crisp (unlike TNG which I also adore and love watching over and over).",1474156800,2,561,4.783505154639175

Topics include prejudice, pets, physical relationships, dealing with new species and the ever popular space sickness when they visit the first Earth-like planet they encounter.

2241302,5,B0007TKH66,"There is universal dislike for this series, from the sappy, sung theme to one of the most unlikeable characters in the galaxy. I had not watched past the second episode when it was on the air but because of the 50th anniversary of Star Trek, I wanted to watch the series.  I have already mentioned the theme.  Next, T'Pal, the Vulcan female character.  For most of the first season, the most annoying, unlikeable character,ever. By the time the writers and the actress found their feet with this character, the audience had left.  Next the bad accents.  When this was made, it was fashionable for characters to have accents. That's great of your actors come by them naturally or can keep them going.  One crewman was supposed to be Texan? The other shifted from Australian to British. Both would lose them often. Lastly, the shots of butts, boobs, pecs in scenes that could have been done without them were annoying.  Being a completist, once I started I had to finish.  To my surprise and joy halfway through the first season the Vulcan character simmered down and the stories became VERY compelling. I recommend this series and it is a shame they got off on the wrong foot.",1474070400,2,1175,4.669902912621359

2241445,3,B0007TKH66,"Having not seen any of ""Enterprise"" since it first aired on TV, I only had vague memories of a thoroughly middling show. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by how decent most of season 1 actually was. I remembered it as being bogged down within winking at past shows/but in-universe future events in that awful, heavy-handed ""get it, we're a prequel!"" other such things have had; but while those moments are still there (and still almost universally cringeworthy), there were far, far fewer than I remembered. The writers seemed to get a handle on which actors worked best together pretty quickly, and clearly worked towards those dynamics (unlike ""Voyager,"" which tried for FAR too long to make us believe Janeway and Tuvok were old friends, even if it never really felt that way). There's some genuinely excellent episodes as well, in a very familiar Trek vein while also managing to somehow get across that, for the characters, all of this is new and exciting. The cast does a decent job of being a little more in awe of everything than previous series' counterparts, which makes sense based on its time period.

Having said that, there's a few too many episodes that are just ""crew trapped somewhere and potentially going to be killed"" than were entirely necessary in a single season. If this was an attempt to impress how much less advanced this era's tech is as compared to ToS-and-later counterparts, well, that was made abundantly clear with the first one of those episode types. I'm sure it was tricky to try and create something that seemed less advanced than a series that had been created almost 4 decades before at the time, but there were just too many times someone was trapped and someone said ""what about the transporter"" but their version wasn't good enough, or their grappling device was pointless where a tractor beam would have solved the problem, etc. Also: just like TNG always had Worf get laid out to prove what a threat the newest enemy was, Enterprise seems to rely on having Commander Tucker react the worst to any kind of survival scenario; it comes off less ""things are dire"" and more ""did he cheat on that survival training Archer keeps mentioning they got?""

Most of the cast is pretty good, character issues aside. Acting is about what you'd expect from a ""Star Trek"" series, and compared to some earlier first seasons of ""Treks"" it can feel downright Shakespearean. Anthony Montgomery may be the only exception in the main cast; his wide-eyed, youthful exuberance just comes across as stilted line readings sometimes. He seems to get over it over time, though, and I imagine going forward he'll seem more natural. Otherwise the main character issues, again, come more from writing than the cast. There's the aforementioned ""Trip can't survive for anything"" problem, for one. Another is the writers seemed particularly obsessed with giving Hoshi crises of confidence, which would be fine except the end of each episode wherein she'd previously had one was written such that you figured she'd sorted the issue (shades of ""Voyager"" and how every ""Seven of Nine learns something about her humanity"" episode seemed to forget every lesson she'd learned in the PREVIOUS one of that same type). But there's also some very good work there; Phlox might look, at first glance, like ""Doctor Neelix,"" a chipper a somewhat goofy alien the audience will again wish horrible things on the whole time. But aside from being useful in a way that's easy to show in-story, his character is also far, far better written with layers of depth shown off particularly in this season's ""Dear Doctor.""

Special effects and CG have aged somewhat better than you may expect from a nearly-15-year-old TV show, and the set design, especially on the ""Enterprise"" interiors, actually still look quite good. It feels like a spceship without feeling like what a specific era thought spaceships would one day look like. The one thing that WILL firmly plant it in a specific time and place are the frosted dye jobs sported by both Bakula and Trinneer.

But to cut to the chase: I watched all of it in short order, and plan on moving on to season two. It's not the best Trek ever, but it's very watchable.",1470787200,,4202,4.840055632823366

2241459,4,B0007TKH66,"Probably my second favorite of the Star Trek tv shows, and some of my favorite shows of all are from Enterprise, though I have mastered fast-forwarding through the wretched theme song.

Star Trek: Enterprise also delves deeply into multiple-show plotlines.  Earlier Star Trek (TNG, VOY, etc...) episodes were very much stand-alone to the point where you could shuffle the episodes and watch them in random order and not lose anything.  That was ok for TNG, but a mistake, I think for Voyager because the very premise of the show suggested long multi-show plotlines.  You see, with multiple-show plotlines, you don't have to cram the whole story into 40 minutes.  As a result, the plotlines are deeper and more complex in Enterprise than any show before it.

There are issues to be sure.  Malcolm Reed, security officer, is possibly the blandest most boring character I have ever seen on TV or big screen.  He is painful to watch at times.  Scott Bakula was an interesting choice as well, but this story is Pre-Federation, Pre-Kirk.  He ends up being a very thoughtful captain, and rightfully so.  Kirk, Picard, and Janeway went boldly where no man has gone before, largely because of the experiences of this crew.  What else... The warp engine looks like it came from The Time Machine, complete with lights and levers, not very creative.  I could nit-pick further but I don't care to bore you further.  Take a look at Star Trek: Enterprise, it's pretty good right from the early episodes.",1470700800,6,1488,4.853174603174603
2241460,4,B0007TKH66,"I give this four stars almost reluctantly.  The show starts out with an interesting premise and dynamic: How does humanity cope with its first real foray into deep space exploration?  There is some interesting tension with the Vulcans that are advocates of caution and introduction to species such as the Klingon.  Shields don't exist, transporting crew is fraught with danger and may times the Enterprise is outgunned and over matched.  There are some intriguing episodes, some missteps and a few great episodes. Its a fun season and if you view it after many years of trekless TV, it is much better than initially perceived.  However, this season has flaws that were never corrected.  The ship and crew run to smoothly too quickly.  Lip service is paid to some issues and then most problems are glossed over.  While this crew is meant to seem not as polished around the edges as is the ship, it still feels as if this should come after Kirk's Enterprise rather than before.  While the ensemble cast has some strong characters and actors there is not much development and it is hard to invest in these people.  Promising character arcs start to stagnate by the end of season.  And while it is nice to see some new aliens in the Trek universe, I personally tuned in to see fights with Klingons (and other more familiar species) which are present, but could be more central to the story. Still an enjoyable season that starts to show the cracks that led the series demise",1470700800,,1470,4.703125

Season 1 has a lot of first contact story lines that seem to have good bit of true science in the science fiction. This season's stories pick up right around episode 6: the Andorian Incident.

While a lot of people didn't like the series and felt it wasn't a true ""Star Trek"" product, I liked it but didn't watch all of the episodes. I have enjoyed Scott Bakula's work from ""Quantum Leap"" on and though he did a very good job as the first captain of the Enterprise.  Overall, the acting in it was pretty good and most of the story lines were good and written fairly well.  Just about any series has a few episodes that don't measure up and this series is not exception.  But compared to some of the television that we often get, it was brilliant.  The special effects in it were well done and yes, this Enterprise did look more modern than Kirk's Enterprise, but seriously, would we want the effects to be at the level the original Trek displayed? The whole cold time war storyline was on-going through the series, but it started in season 1 so it's good to be able to watch the episodes without commercials and rapidly.

2241649,4,B0007TKH66,"This was a great show, deserved better ratings when it was on the air, and the show got better over time.

2241651,4,B0007TKH66,"I watched several episodes of Enterprise when it was released but never really got into the series.  Binge watching the first season again several years later, I have come to realize that the biggest problem with Enterprise was the idiotic them song Berman chose for some unknown reason.  What kind of mood altering chemicals were they feeding their focus groups that helped with that decision?  Using the skip ahead feature of the Amazon video player eliminated the annoyance of the lyrical theme song and leaves behind an interesting take on  ""how we got here"" for the series that in reality preceded Enterprise but in the story came much later.  It is a shame the show only lasted four seasons as I am quite enjoying re-watching what many considered the ""ugly stepchild"" of the Star Trek universe.  Great series.",1464652800,,815,4.869565217391305

2241669,5,B0007TKH66,"This was the last Star Trek TV series and, my personal preference, the best. That's saying a lot as the other four were and still are great. The only problem with the series is that it didn't last two more seasons at least. The producers really dropped the ball. Enterprise deserved more story line progression. Not the toxic haste that made up the series finale. I recommend watching every episode in order and discard the last (writer's revenge almost as bad as The Finder series finale).

I've literally watched every episode five times over and still come back once a year to relive it. It's that awesome.",1464220800,,609,4.691588785046729

It contains a whole lot of 'origin' explanations of the characters, races, species, and planets that are in the other Star Trek series. The story lines are great material for the background of how the Enterprise develops its technology. Scott Bakula is terrific as Captain Archer and Jolene Blalock plays the Vulcan T'Pol exceptionally well. A brilliant concept series for filling all those Star Trek gaps.",1463097600,,459,5.052631578947368

They have done (through episode 8) a very good job of fitting in the technology, aliens, and situations to a time before Kirk, et al. The Vulcan character""s (T'pol) ""flatness"" of speech is a little irritating, but that may change as she's exposed to humans. SFX are of course excellent.",1463011200,,347,4.612903225806452

2241759,5,B0007TKH66,"I for one loved that they brought the Trek Universe back to this point in time. Even just in this season, they explored a lot of little details about TOS that was mentioned or barely shown. Then they put some serious meat on the bones.

The whole Temporal Cold War never hit on much for me. Yeah, great idea BUT just so prevalent I feel like they needed to step back from it a bit. Shran was a MAJOR success in my book. I wish they gotten to Season 5 and seen what they did with him.

Favorite has to be Dear Doctor. Simple setup but a story I think Rodenberry would have written himself.
Acquisition was fun as it showed us the Ferengi early on.

No bad episodes. There were a few weak moments but overall, FAR better than Voyager's first two seasons.",1462147200,,752,4.208333333333333

2241790,3,B0007TKH66,I have been a trekky all my life but I sorta skipped enterprise when it came out.  I didn't like the way it worked inside the ST universe and when i caught a few episodes hear and there it was never enough to keep me hooked.  Watching it now has been enjoyable enough.  I don't think they did enough with what the had but its good enough scifi.  Not the best trek but still good scifi.,1461024000,,385,4.026315789473684

2241795,4,B0007TKH66,"I wish I could give this season a 5, honestly Enterprise is probably my favorite Star Trek series (despite all the haters). When dealing with a first season if any program though there are always bugs that need worked out. By the end of the season, I feel that the characters and ""mission"" of the series had really been more thoroughly developed. It's just a matter of getting through the first few episodes in my opinion. Archer comes off as brash and wreck less for most of this season, which is frustrating when comparing him to Kirk or Picard... however it's important to realize that this series takes place at the beginning, before the prime directive and before the Federation. Once I started watching it from that perspective I really began to enjoy Enterprise.",1461024000,,769,4.746268656716418

2241815,3,B0007TKH66,"I enjoyed season one very much but will say that as the series progresses, the more it is a matter of shoving political correctness down your throat than putting out good entertainment. If you don't want to get into that I would recommend not starting the series in the first place as that was very disappointing--it actually distracts from the story put forth in the title song and the beginning season. An occasional show or reference to something controversial in society is one thing but this becomes a champion for all causes and in my opinion, it ruins the series. Our family loves all things Trek but this series is our least favorite-between the publicly controversial subjects they barely attempt to disguise in other planets' cultures and the bedroom scenes portrayed further into the series it isn't the family entertainment we enjoy. I can't give the rating for the first season what it is worth because it might lead someone to start watching something they later would regret and as the seasons progress the rating decreases so by season 4 would be a single star-""hate it"". Season one in itself was very good and season two was probably okay from what I recall, but at least by season three I was seeing a big change in the way it was written. Too bad, if they'd stuck to the basic story of being out in space and figuring things out for the first time instead of trying to connect it to everything of controversy in our society it could have been a great series. Season 4 is just one controversy after another. I'm not taking one side or the other in what is politically correct--I just don't want it in my entertainment!",1459209600,,1636,4.625429553264605

2241826,5,B0007TKH66,"Pros.  If you liked the original series with Captain Kirk and you like history, you will enjoy seeing the back story play out.  If you like Vulcans you will like the insights about Vulcans and their character and how they related to humans and to each other.  The episodes make the case for the prime directive, but they continually find reasons to try to slip around it too.  The characters are enjoyable.  The actors said they had fun working together and you can see that.  Stories are generally well written and not entirely predictable.  There are some interesting bioethics raised.

Cons.  Acting could have been better, but I think Star Trek fans have generally been forgiving in this area.",1458259200,,697,4.7899159663865545

2241900,4,B0007TKH66,I like Star Trek science fiction tale. Just don't really care for Scott Bacula's acting style. Giving the series a new look here and the story line is growing on me slowly but surely. All the new science fiction seems to be mixed with a lot of horror and the Star Trek saga is milder to watch. Also I am noticing the character development is better than I remember when the show was on tv.,1456531200,,389,4.2
2241901,4,B0007TKH66,"I didn't like the new series at first. It was like they went too far back into the future history of Earth. The Vulcans weren't our allies, they were cold, arrogant and even cruel. And the ship was kind of pathetic compared to other Treks. Also I didn't care much for some of the crew, Hoshi whined a lot as did Malcolm. And Archer was a bit of a geeky snob with his water polo. Who watches that crap? Anyway, the show had a slow start but by the time Shrann (Jeffrey Coomb) and the Andorians showed up, I was hooked. Finally we were on our way. I liked the season enough to recommend it to my sister who promptly took the first season box and kept it. I liked the show enough to buy a second copy for myself.",1456444800,,709,4.071428571428571

2241903,4,B0007TKH66,"Only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the acting and usually the directing usually being good and with good actors. But quite frankly...season 3 sucks. Some major issues:

-A drug using, emotionally unstable Vulcan, really???
-Starfleet attacking innocent people and stranding them in space. Umm, we wouldn't do that now and have laws against it in civilian life, military law (UCMJ) and international law.
-Starfleet shooting first and asking questions later??
-Some real serious plot holes.. I mean gigantic plot holes, to the point it almost feels like they're trying to insult their audience on purpose.
-And yeah that opening song. Who thought a wannabe Rod Stewart song would be a good idea. Seriously?
-All the time travel. Literally at least half of the episodes deal with time travel.
-They have the same or better technology in ""Enterprise"" then they do in Next Generation.
-Lots and lots of inconsistencies. From plots to technologies.
-Almost all of season 3, and good parts of season 2 and 4, with the whole time traveling/Xindi story arc. Its literally episode after episode in season 3...gets real old real fast.
-A ""captain"" of an ROTC squad has better judgement then alot of the stuff they wrote for Bakula. Ticks me off cause I like him as an actor. Its like watching all those good actors in that movie ""Noah"", amazing how bad writting and production can make good actors look bad.
-The persistent message that scientists and science and technology are bad.

Part of what makes good science fiction good is that it has, at the very least, somewhat believable technology and holds true to at least the basic laws of physics. Its almost like they totally reject all things technical and in fact demonize it. Not a real smart thing to do for Star Trek fans or any sci-fi fan. If I wanted that, I would watch Star Wars. I know a lot of the actors don't like the techno-babble as they say, but umm, you know how many Trekkies have schematics and blueprints of the Enterprise ships?? Or have figured out how Warp theory might actually work?? We like the techno-babble... alot of us do the techno-babble in real life. Who did you think your audience was?

The main reason this one is always rated the lowest out of all Star trek's is this: It diverged too much and in too many ways from real Star Trek. Star Trek shouldnt be used as an experimental vehicle for your lame ass ideas.

They try to add in all this action and lots of scantily clad pretty people...its so overt it comes off as an insult. It makes you wonder if the shows producers and writters actually like Star Trek or sci-fi at all.

If you turn the whole Xindi/Time-travvel thing into maybe 4 or 5 episodes instead of half the series, this would have done a whole lot better. And for gods sake get rid of the song, its soo bad, and its your first impression of every episode. First impressions count. I don't care if Berman or Braga take this the wrong way....they got too selfish and forgot who they were making the show for and did not treat the legacy of Star trek with respect.

Star Trek is popular because of Gene Roddenberry's vision, not his employees vision.",1456358400,5,3151,4.627906976744186

2241909,1,B0007TKH66,"So many 5-star ratings! People must be watching through Star Trek eyeglasses.  I too love Star Trek (and have even been to a few conventions) This 'prequel' is simply irritating to watch on two points: writing, music, and content.

Writing: The writing is overly simplistic. The actors must deliver the lines slowly pausing for deliberate stares of understanding to bring some life to it.  After a few episodes, it was like watching a high school play.

Music: The original Star Trek sound track is art.  It brought a new level of style and excitement to science-fiction. It would be hard to match, but Enterprise does not even try.  The problem is not merely the odd soft-rock ballad theme music, but the battle soundtrack as well.

Content: The actions taken by these ""men of science"" and ""explorers"" are horrific. One example occurs in an episode 2, the communications officer and the ship doctor release a slug onto an alien planet because they cannot care for it. Really?  We know the ecological havoc caused by released pets. Florida is a prime example, where pet snakes and fish have destroyed native wildlife and habits. To make this episode even worse, the pet is a snail. Snails are asexual, meaning it can reproduce without a mate.

The show does have one saving grace: the spacecraft.  The exterior design and detail is amazing.  The bridge is a nicely conceived precursor to later (more advanced) ships.

This review covers Season One.  I did not need to watch more.  In my opinion, only diehard Star Trek viewers kept this version on-air longer than the original -- and that is a shame.",1455753600,4,1600,4.791970802919708

2241981,5,B0007TKH66,"Out of all the Star Trek series and films, Enterprise is easily the most overlooked, and was the only one since the original to be cancelled. This isn't because it wasn't as good as the rest, but simply the way it was marketed. The show is in fact a prequel to Kirk's Enterprise, and does take place before the Federation, but what the show lacks in technology, is more than made up for with realism and some of the best character development in the Star Trek franchise.

100 years after Zefren Cochrane's warp flight, the human race has had enough of Vulcans holding them back, and have created the first warp five star ship in human history. Over the Vulcan's objections, Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), the son of the engines designer, has been selected to Captain the ship and explore a galaxy that humans know very little about.

This show is extremely important to the franchise and all Trekkies, as it not only shows humanities first trip out of our solar system and first contact with all the races we've come to know over the years, but the show fills in a lot of the gaps from all the other series and films! Enterprise explores the origins of Data's creator, the Eugenic Wars (which created Khan), the development of many protocols and much of the tech we see on future ships, but most important of all the series shows how the foundation for the Federation and the creation of star fleet all came together.

Enterprise was also unique for it's character development and realism, in that it takes place in the not to distant future. We get to know the crew intimately, from their fears to their families, and we see them doing and discussing things never before seen in Star Trek. The Enterprise crew has a classic movie night, watches sports on TV, has pets, and they even talk about sex.

The cast is lead by Scott Bakula, which was another great move by producers. Casting a veteran science fiction actor, whose been in long running series, automatically gives him that air of experience and authority that Picard had. He's also a younger man, so with no federation policies in place yet, Archer can be just as much of a risk taker as Kirk was, even more so.

Star Trek Enterprise was extremely enjoyable, and a series people could relate to more than any other in the Star Trek franchise. The show isn't simply about the future and the Federation, it's about what it means to be human and how that compares to other species. It shows what we need to do in order to get along with and understand other cultures, but most of all it fills in so many holes from previous films and episodes, that it truly was the missing link.

Unfortunately for Star Trek fans, the show barely made a hundred episodes, because it was on a dying network, that folded shortly after the show was cancelled, screwing us trekkies out of three more seasons. As with all the previous series, the story has been continued in books, but in this case, the books were written by the main writers of the series, and do encompass everything that would have happened in seasons five, six, and seven.",1454284800,,3080,4.570652173913044

2241984,4,B0007TKH66,"I've never seen this before.  I quit watching TV in general, and Star Trek in particular, right before the Voyager series finale.  Up until then I had watched all the episodes of all the Star Treks since the Next Generation, but I'd heard talk that people didn't care much for Enterprise so I didn't bother to watch it.  Now, while faced with a hiatus in Sense8 and Gotham, I decided to look into it.  What I found was not bad at all.  The best thing about it is that here is a whole new harvest of Star Trek shows that I've never seen, and they follow the Star Trek formats pretty closely.  It's refreshing that much of the Star Trek universe, technology, rules and traditions are not yet in place, and they're in developmental stages.

On the negative side there are also a few points.  1) I don't know who these people are or hardly what their jobs are supposed to be, and 2) there are so few of them!  It's like a skeleton crew.  3) I don't find them sympathetic either - well, maybe the Asian woman is better defined, and so is the captain.  Too much is made of the Vulcan woman's figure, above and beyond the Star Trek norm. And the captain has too much bravado, similar to Captain Kirk.

I was in junior high school when the first Star Trek came out and loved the idea and show. The other Star Treks were not as good because they were too preachy. Every episode was about proving a social issue using space aliens to prove everything from the need for women's rights, to the need for a socialistic society. However, I was greatly impressed by Star Trek: Enterprise. The time frame was much better, not every problem could be solved by technology. Enterprise has action and a sense of adventure without all of the preaching. Yet in the end, like all great television, the show does convey an important message to the viewer.

I enjoyed the fresh faces but noticed that they are still trying to adhere to the ""winning"" formula: a Vulcan who probably is not full blood Vulcan, a strong male captain who is a bit of a rogue, a southern male with down home way of speaking plainly, and the crew member who has a strange outward appearance. Hopefully, the story lines are not too formulaic, but sometimes formulaic series lend a bit of warm familiarity, like a warm blanket to wrap up with.",1454112000,,540,4.356435643564357

I've been a big Bakula fan since Quantum Leap. While some of his performances in Enterprise were a bit on the slow and deliberate side, overall he was very effective, as was the rest of the cast.

2242012,2,B0007TKH66,"To make a great work of art, the artist must put a great deal of time and effort into learning his craft.  The same is true for depicting the true potential of a future humanity.  To depict an evolved people going where no Person has gone before, those who depict this must put in the time and effort to learn how to show us what this means.  This Series failed, the writers and the management had virtually no depth to their understanding of what it is to behave in a truly evolved and ethical manner.  For example, they repeatedly tried to justify torture.  Because at the time this series was made the corrupt US government led by Cheney endorsed torture, before any trial.  And that fear and ignorance born out of 9-11 translated into this series in a flawed and disturbing manner.  Star Trek Enterprise is a corruption of the franchise.  It was not a total failure.  It had its moments.  So to be fair I gave it two stars.

Star Trek attempts to do what no other series, or movie, or franchise has ever done.  It attempts to show us what we can be if we really try to do what is right.  Star Wars shows a corrupt galaxy with good people struggling to change it.  Instead, Star Trek gives us insight into what a non-corrupt civilization can do.  There is no greater achievement in entertainment media.  For some that do not have the vision to see what we can do, and for those of us who will take what they see in Star Trek and find even greater ideas, that is worth doing.  We see what could be, and some of us strive for this, add to it, make it greater.  And with this vision we can change our reality for the better.  This is the hope Star Trek brings, where nothing else, has to date come close.",1453593600,2,1704,4.26875

The theme song for this show (I speak as someone who has no knowledge, yet, of season two and beyond) makes me angry. I want to hate everything involved with this version of Star Trek, because of the introductory music. What happened to the dignity of an orchestral theme? Who castrated the singer?

Sometimes, later in the season, you get some belly laughs  from comments made. If you are a student of Star Trek, you'll understand how cutthroat and arrogant the Vulcans are. Especially the politicians - just like in any other society. If your purpose is to be entertained, then you are already able to willingly suspend disbelief. So take the time to sit back and enjoy.

Which is what I was hoping Broken Bow would be about. There ended up being so many different plots and storylines that it was hard to follow. I really like Dr. Phlox as a character. The rest just seemed like cut out characters from the Star Trek storyline.
Archer, the strong compassionate captain, A Vulcan, the security guy and the engineer who can keep the anit-matter contained no matter what. In the end it had so many convoluted storylines Enterprise was hard to really care about a particular character.",1444262400,,672,4.703389830508475

They didn't explore what the message he was carrying and why was it important; who was in the ship that attached the Enterprise and was blown up; or what were the true circumstances of the dead crew.  I understand it was only a half hour show, but they could have continued it across three or four episodes and skipped what they offered in episodes 2 and 3.

The episodes did, however, get better, though there continues to be various but rather insignificant flaws. T'Pol did settle down after a few episodes and has begun to explore interspecies sex with a couple of the officers--over done in the scene with John Billingsley, the Chief Medical Officer, but that's not a bad thing considering her magnificent body--adds a bit of spice. Archer finally grew some balls and is acting more like a confident captain. I think it's a good show, but not a ""Star Trek Next Generation.""",1444176000,,891,5.1875

Sometimes the scientist in me gets in the way and I realize that some of the things being done are not possible, but I put those aside and just sit back and enjoy. I have found mostly so far that each episode holds my attention. It is good clean fun, and in this day and age with so much bad ""stuff"" and bad language on the air waves, shows like this are appreciated.",1441584000,,385,4.012987012987013

All of the characters have something to contribute in each episode, so as not to leave you feeling bored.  One major surprise while watching this is the continuity of the story line continually moves forward, so for example, events that have occurred in previous episodes will later re-surface in later ones.

2242321,4,B0007TKH66,"Character development was good and there were enough to keep the viewer interested.  Plots were a rehash of every other Trek series only the names and places were changed to protect the screenwriters.  The main theme of US Vs the Vulcans had great possibilities but is kind of fizzled.

2242322,3,B0007TKH66,"After re watching this years  after it got cancelled, I really see why it didn't do well. The show dwells wayyyyyy  too much on the crew's interpersonal matters and relationships, and hardly at all of the sci fi aspect of their mission. The show had  a potentially great storyline with the suliban cabal plot, but the writers kept going back and forth among other more mundane stories. The show is really across between a British soap opera and some teen drama show on the wb channel.",1440374400,,484,4.604651162790698

It's an interesting prequel to the original Star Trek series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.

Now, as the new kids, you can expect  some of that, but it went  on for  too many episodes. By the  time they came  into their  own , it was too late viewership was down and the network  didn't  see a  reason  to  continue  to support  the show, which  is  a  shame  because  I  loved  the  premise  of the show, the characters , and the actors. The scripts  just didn't live up to the promise. And the whole temporal war story arc was more of a distraction  then an interesting  concept.

What makes this ENTERPRISE series so special is that it is set up as being the first explorations, based on the time period of when warp drive is just beginning to be in use by Earth Human Beings. In other words, these episodes are based on events that happened before the age of advanced warp drive as detailed in the Original Star trek Captain Kirk Series!
These stories are written at the time period of where WE may be within the next century or so from NOW. Fascinating. The Humans have just begun relations with the Vulcans, and it is a rather strained relationship at best.

I bet NBC never stopped regretting that foolish move.

Star Trek enterprise is a pre-quill and was very good in many ways; however, sometimes they are technology seemed more advanced than the original series which doesn't make sense.

Enterprise takes a lot of flak for supposedly ruining the Trek franchise. But that is a little unfair.

There are some things about Enterprise that don't fit with the general continuity of the rest of the franchise. The main one of those things is the general look and feel of the show. While it looks cool and realistic, it doesn't flow with the rest of the franchise. In the show's defense it does occur 100-200 years before everything else in the franchise. Things are bound to look a little different. But it's also presented in widescreen, where the rest of the franchise is 4:3. But that's really the biggest issue with the series.

The show is NOT just tacked onto the franchise with no reference to the known Trek universe. In fact there are numerous references to the rest of the Trek world. The Eugenics program with references to Khan is a multi episode story arc that features the ancestor of Noonian Soong, played by Brent Spiner. That story arc also includes an explanation about why Klingons from The Original Series look different than Klingons from the Next Generation era. (It's goofy, but it's fun) The Borg that were sent back in time in Star Trek First Contact are referenced. There are just many many references to the Trek universe you know and love, and explanations on how that universe developed into the one you know from 'the future'.

It's a well made show. If you watched the rest of Trek you owe it to yourself to bring it home with Enterprise.",1429574400,,1479,4.622137404580153

2242667,5,B0007TKH66,"As a big Star Trek fan, I'm baffled as to how I missed the entire Enterprise series.  My first impression after the fires two or three movies was less than enthusiastic.  I thought the stories were interesting but the maturity of the captain/crew was questionable.  I expected a Picard like Captain but got a somewhat impulsive, immature Scott Bakula.  After watching about four of the movies I realized the value of the Enterprise series in its ability to fill in the time prior to Kirk.  The series explains the development of the warp technology and the early relationship between Vulcans and earthlings.  It takes place before the ""prime directive"" so I guess that explains some of the actions of the captain. I have now finished the first season and plan on watching the next three.  One interesting aspect of the writing is the tendency to tie in previous events into later movies.  I absolutely love the theme song and the lead in to each of the movies.  The alien doctor is a nice addition to the series.  Taken in the context of the overall Star Trek story, Enterprise is well worth watching.",1429228800,,1101,4.6875

The Vulcan science officer T'Pol unites logic, strength and sexuality that breaks any number of stereotypes and prissy notions.
The doctor's gleeful curiosity and polyamorous culture breaks more molded thinking about sexuality, gender and the inevitability of what are -- actually -- flexible human institutions and behavior.
Time paradoxes and complexities on a level with that other great series, Fringe.",1429228800,,498,5.565789473684211

It's the closest to the original series in ""sophistication"". It sometimes has too much the feel of 50's science fiction.
Blundering through the universe with no ""Prime Directive"" is not a good idea! Especially if you're still using ""particle"" based
weapons instead of ""photon"" technology  and you run into the klingons! But hey what do I know! It could be worse! they

2242686,5,B0007TKH66,"You're introduced to a Star Trek captain as impulsive, at least in the first season, as Captain Kirk to follow.. He becomes more captain-like in the remaining seasons. Without a holodeck, the writers resort to time travel to provide plots. If you're already a Trekkie, you're better off viewing the series before reading the reviews, so you don't stumble on plot spoilers. The captain is not Picard, but who can match a Shakespearian actor.

Subsequent seasons become more action oriented with the usual time & circumstance deadlines. Jolene Blaylock portrays the resident Vulcan, neither too formal nor out-of-character for a Vulcan. One can well imagine Spock coming from the same planet. All in all, a good start to a long running series. Keep in mind, it's a prequel, 100 years before Captain Kirk, so don't let the lack of technology throw you, compared to prior Star Trek series.",1428451200,,885,4.97972972972973

2242736,5,B0007TKH66,"This show was really appealing. I have loved Star Trek the Next Generation since it came out when I was an adolescent, but I really found this to be even better. There is a smugness about those characters with the Federation and their role in the well-established that you don't notice until it is absent. Well, it is absent 100 years before. The characters on Enterprise are feeling their way through, making a lot of mistakes, and looking out for each other because everybody is in such an uncertain environment. The History major in me gets a kick out of how many things have survived from the 21st century to the 22nd.",1426636800,,622,4.5625
2242737,5,B0007TKH66,"I fully realize that Enterprise does not appeal to everyone in the Startrek fraternity. It is a return to basics in which the Prime Directive does not yet exist, where mankind is a junior member amongst space faring races, and the crew cannot rely on techno-babble to get them out of every situation. In fact the tools they have to work with are downright primitive - even the transporter is a risky proposition!

This means that superior story telling is required and unfortunately this is where we run into problems. There are some gems, however there are too many missed opportunities, too many missteps.

The crew is far more interesting than any of the previous series; T'pol is the best portrayed, and well written, Vulcan since Spock. Captain Archer, you feel, could genuinely captain a real starship; such is his commanding presence. The Doctor, Phlox, is immeasurably better than any previous ship's doctor and completely eclipsing Bones from the original Star Trek. Indeed the only weak spot in the entire crew is Charles (Trip) Tucker. Who I would gladly have thrown out an airlock - he can be summarized as an educated redneck in space. It is completely inconceivable that T'Pol would've ""taken up"" with Trip, especially when the chemistry between her and Archer was so much more intriguing.

Unfortunately the series really got itself into trouble during series 3 with an extended story about a race called the Xindi. This just doesn't work and although there are a couple of excellent episodes the series, as a whole, tended to drag. Series 4 was a return to some ripping yarns and even some fun with a revisit to an evil parallel universe. Sadly, however, the recovery was not enough to save the series.

Without doubt Star Trek: Enterprise is the most under-appreciated of all the series which is a huge shame.",1426636800,,1826,4.861736334405145

I for one don't agree with this series naysayers, I find the stories well written and full of action and intregue. Plus you get to see aliens and creatures not seen since the first series back in 1967 like the Andorians.

That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the show anyway. It seems like a good attempt at showing man's first attempt at interstellar exploration. The ships technology is primitive compared to what we saw in the other series, even TOS, but that's perfect. It should be. The ship faces challenges, as does the crew. They often find themselves outclassed both by the experience of the others they meet and the technology of their ships and weapons. But the human spirit, the desire to learn, the respect for other life forms are common to all the crews from the Star Trek universe. This is the crew that helps develop the Prime Directive, the crew that unites friends and enemies out in the galaxy to create the United Federation of Planets.

2242806,5,B0007TKH66,"Enterprise was sadly canceled after just 4 seasons and probably was one of the better Star Trek Television Series since the TNG. It's problem was that it needed time for Character development and that it came so quickly after the last Star Trek Series. There seemed to be some fatique out there which really is a shame because the show was solid with decent scripts and the actors were solid for the show. I was thrilled to discover that Enterprise was available on my newly ordered Amazon Fire TV and have again bee enjoying the series in full HD. My only wish it that it had 5.1 surround, but the 2.0 LPCM through my Bose Lifestyle V35 System compensates for that and sound is full through all 5 speakers. I have since discovered that the original series has been converted to HD with 5.1 surround and have enjoyed the refreshed series as well with the new special effects. It really has made the show worth viewing all over again.

2242835,5,B0007TKH66,"Not being a hard core Trekkie has its advantages.  You don't mind when the World of Roddenberry gets a tweaking.  In fact, it's pretty darn fun.

Enterprise was one such tweaking.  Up until that point everything had been post James Tiberius Kirk and NCC 1701.  Now we're some navy years earlier then Kirk with Jonathan Archer as the skipper of Enterprise NX 01.

Manking has been visited by Vulcans, according to the lore, and we're working our collective butts off to break Warp 5.  While the Vulcans have this capacity and technology, they keep it to themselves in the belief that if shared they may be riveled.  Many feel the Vulcans are using Earth for their own good and Earth should divest themselves of the visitors.

Season One is actually fairly gripping.  Archer (Scott Bakula) is ordered to take T'pol (Jolene Blaylock) aboard as an embassary of sorts.  Fortunately she is reluctant to be a mere spectator but wants in on the action.

This is a worthwhile prequel.  It follow along previously set lore yet doesn't desire to be merely a clone of all other works.",1423958400,,1072,4.698924731182796
2242836,2,B0007TKH66,"I'm a trekkie.  I grew up watching tng.  I loved Picard.  I loved how they wrote him as someone who is uncomfortable around children, but he's stuck on a ship full of families.  Remember Captain Picard Day and how uncomfortable he was?  Geordi and Data were just really decent open minded people without a hint of anger to them.  Like everyone else, I didn't care for Wesley, but Beverly brought a maternal energy to the show that would now be rejected by almost all science fiction producers.  Riker and Troi were very close to being cliche characters, but thankfully the writers never had them take over the show...

I mention the cast of tng, to contrast how lacking in personality the crew of Enterprise was.  The two best characters were T'Pol and Phlox-- the two aliens!  Tex and The Bloke had no identity other than their nationality.  They made a whole episode about finding out what The Bloke liked to eat-- spoiler, it was bangers and mash.  WTF?!?  The black guy's wide eyed amazement at the world around him soon wore thin and he came off as simple in the head.  The Asian was WAY overwritten.  They had an episode where a slug was dying because it was out of its environment (just like Hoshi).  And in the end, the slug was released into an alien environment to mirror Hoshi's plight.  Doesn't that kind of break some laws about contaminating an entire world for the sake of a slug?  Just awful and  forced writing!  But the worst character on Enterprise was Archer.  You know that expression that a camel is a horse designed by committee?  Archer was an odd fusion of Picard's wisdom and humanity, Kirk's youthful recklessness, Sisko's personable demeanor, and Janeway's superhuman intelligence.  I didn't envy Scott Bakula's task of having to portray Buckaroo Bonzai.  In the first few seasons, it looked like Bakula always had gas.  I guess that's one way of trying to  portray such an impossibly multi-faceted character-- scrunch up your face and pretend like you're holding in a fart.

Season one had horrible, horrible writing.  In that same Hoshi episode, there was actually a friggin' countdown as the ship is about to be blown to pieces as Hoshi had to get her nerve.  But my god were the episodes boring!  A low point was the 'Reed alert/ Red alert' thing.  Like a battleship doesn't already have a set of protocols in place!  The head writer should have said, ""No.  That's not clever.  What you had was a 2 a.m. brain fart and trust me, tomorrow you will see how stupid a Reed alert is!""

Season two continued in this fashion.  Horrible writing people should be ashamed of.  I liked the Borg episode, but I don't like how it ignored the timeline.  And the temporal cold war?!?  What a cynical piece of sh-- idea!  TNG had Q and the Borg!  DS9 had the Dominion-- the coolest bad guys ever!  A Temporal Cold War?!?

Season three was better in the sense that the series had a focus.  However, I liked Star Trek, particularly TNG because it showed a hopeful new world.  Shamelessly basing the third season on 9/11, and having Archer torture people.. Look.  Star Trek, even a prequel should have a certain feel to it.  I watch science fiction as escapism from the real world.  The whole thing about Tex being bitter because his sister died on 9/11 and he wanted to kill all Muslims.. Well, I hear that kind of sh-- all the time.  ""Let's nuke Iran!""  All the anger really made the show not fun, because 90 percent of the population wanted to invade Iraq.  People now change their tunes with that ""I was never in favor of war with Iraq.""  Yes you were.  I remember, even if you don't.

Season 4 was my favorite, and the series was really getting its groove.  I was even finally starting to tolerate Tex.  And thank god Angry Archer stayed in season 3!  I would give season 4 probably 3 1/2 stars.  Had Enterprise started out at that level, it could have spawned a new generation of Trekkies.  Damn kids nowadays watching their superhero shows on their phones!  Back in my day, we couldn't instantly stream whatever we wanted.  When we wanted our porn we had to take the walk of shame through the curtains at the video store.  It was a right of passage and it made us men, damnit!  Anyway..

ST: Enterprise season one was the perfect example of how NOT to do a series.  If I was in charge, I would have done almost everything differently.  But then  again, I kind of liked the theme song and intro so what do I know?",1423267200,2,4432,4.526582278481013

2242839,4,B0007TKH66,"I loved this series, and was excited when it first went on the air.  But that theme music is horrible.  Such an awful theme song, for such a great show.  I would literally grit my teeth, praying for the song to be over with as quickly as possible.  It was agonizing.  I can guarantee that that opening music alone turned off a number of people from the show. (Imagine someone doing a bad Karaoke of a Don Henley song, while tone deaf and drunk).

It's a shame.  The show really had a LOT of potential.  The acting was great (with a few exceptions... I'm looking at you Mayweather), some of the ideas and concepts were good.  But the plots were sometimes a muddled mess (The Xindi, and Temporal War story lines dragged on, and even the writers admitted they didn't know where they were going with them).  While I found some of the crew interactions interesting, but you could tell that the writers were trying just a little too hard. (The decontamination scene with Travis and T'Pol nearly undressed, rubbing anti-bacterial gel on each other was fun, but it was honestly pure titillation.  Let me put it this way.... you could tell T'Pol was cold.  Really Cold.).

Like I said a great show.  Lots of potential.  A bit silly at times, but definitely worth watching. It only they had gotten rid of that theme music.",1422316800,,1312,4.523404255319149

2242890,1,B0007TKH66,"It is a little-known fact, that George Lucas sued the creators of ""Enterprise"" on the basis of copyright infringement. This should come as a surprise to no one who's seen the ""Star Wars"" prequels, and noticed the similarities.

Lucas's statement in court was as follows:

""Star Trek: Enterprise"" is a shameless rip off of my own ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy, not only in its premise of being a lame prequel series that destroys the original franchise, but in more specific elements as well. Similarities between my prequel and ""Star Trek's"" prequel are as follows:

* Flat characters who don't come close to holding a candle to the complexity of the original franchise's cast

* A super-annoying, ""jolly"" alien, presented as a comic-relief character with important knowledge the heroes need (Dr. Phlox, Jar Jar Binks)

* A monotone female lead who exists more for sex appeal than actual character development (T'Pol, Padme)

* A monotone male lead, who's kind of a dick (Annakin, Archer)

* Plot points that violate the most basic foundations of the original franchise's canon. (The Enterprise crew meeting the Borg, the Ferengi, and holodeck malfunctions generations before they're supposed to be discovered; Obi-Wan forgetting to change his name to Ben before Luke was born, Leia's mother dying before she had time to build the memories she describes to Luke in ROTJ, someone other than Yoda training Obi Wan...)

* Cute, non-verbal sidekick who makes the show almost bearable, despite having no business being in this prequel (Archer's beagle, R2D2)

* A trendy new style of storytelling that doesn't fit the tone of the original franchise at all. (Constant sex and swearing in ""Enterprise""; constant headache-inducing, video-game CGI in ""Star Wars."")

The only original original element ""Enterprise"" manage to come up with on its own was the gratuitous, ""sexy,"" decontamination chamber.

Lucas was ultimately successful in his case, leading to the cancellation of ""Enterprise."" Sadly, this didn't stop the prequels of both ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" from being god-awful.",1418256000,8,2075,5.219879518072289

It is horrible, what were the producers smoking to decide to go with a yucky early nineties style Bryan Adams-esque song instead of a traditional orchestrated theme song?",1415664000,,461,4.275862068965517

Admittedly, I'm not a dyed in the wool Star Trek fanatic, but Sci-Fi is the genre that I prefer, and this show has excellent writing, with far more interesting plot lines than TNG.  I like TNG, but don't love it, and the original Trek with Shattner is downright cheesy.  Enterprise has great acting with all but a few exceptions. For example, Jolene Blalock plays T'Pol, and at times seems strained to remain in character, but overall is compelling in the role of an unemotional alien,  which is probably among the tougher characters to play.  Scott Bakula is perfect in the role as Archer, presenting as a stereotype  easily recognizable among present day astronauts.  The show also does a great job of linking the present day spacecraft with the ultra futuristic machinery on TNG and even the original, and one can easily imagine the transition from the uniforms worn today by air force or navy pilots, to the type worn by the crew on Enterprise.  For the uniforms worn by the crew on TNG?  Maybe?  For the uniforms worn on the original such as ""go-go"" boots and super short mini-skirts?  Not so much.",1415404800,,1146,4.651741293532338

2242965,5,B0007TKH66,"There is a lot of debate as to why this series didn't fair as well as others in the franchise. The die hard trekkies will nit pick out details or argue over minutia that many of us could care less about. The reality is that this series was very entertaining and it only got better season after season. What people have to appreciate is that this was the LAST TV series in the Star Trek franchise AND is a prequel even set before The Original Series. So the writers had to intricately weave in numerous events that would lay the foundation for the other franchises for continuity purposes.

The characters and actors are superb. The character development throughout the four seasons is fantastic and you feel like you are growing and learning with them as they better define their roles. Captain Archer is pushed to the limits and breaks rules and challenges morality better than any Captain in the franchise. There is no Prime Directive, no Federation. It's like the wild wild west.

The plots are on par with the franchised TV series. Some of them are even better in my opinion that other franchises. For example, I think the idea of a temporal war which drags Earth into the conflict was entertaining. I also like the uniqueness of the species encountered in this series. Again, this series can stand on par with the best of the franchise:

1. Excellent acting and character development
2. Consistent writing to maintain the events that led to the foundation of the Federation, TNG, TOS, etc.
3. Great sets and uniformity with what a prequel would look like taking into account it must fit the time and still have plausible paths to the other franchises.
4. Plots are on par with and at times better than other series.
5. Bonus: special guest stars from others in the series make it a treat (for example, Brent Spiner as the father of the Augments which lays the foundation for the future Data)
6. Elegantly deals with societal issues that involve morality, racism, polygamy, religion, politics, etc. as good as any of the other series and in some cases even better.
7. It's great entertainment and I wish it had more seasons.

The Bad:

1. The theme song. Yes, I know you're going to think this is a grip but this is truly where the series failed. The theme song did not fit the attitude of the show whatsoever. In fact it is so bad, and so off the mark, I skip it every time because it just reminds me how they probably turned off many viewers with the theme song alone. This is the opening symphony to each episode and it should have been theme music instead of a song with lyrics. The producers broke with successful formulas from previous franchises and the opening song with lyrics was a risky bet that just did not pay off. I don't know what they were thinking. Songs are wildly subjective as opposed to a theme which people may not have strong feelings about one way or another. I truly feel the series had trouble because the opening of each episode (except two) used the title song and if you hated it, then you really had to make yourself want to continue watching.

Besides that no other bad for me anyway.

Great series, wish it had lasted longer, and in fact is one of my favorites in the franchise.",1414540800,,3215,4.5327586206896555

2242970,4,B0007TKH66,"While the first season of every Star Trek series is more pain than pleasure, Enterprise turns the tables on the prior formula and brings us a first season that is mostly watchable. Some Trekkies have criticized the series for its depiction of Vulcans, however I believe that the changing dynamics of the Human-Vulcan relationships brings a fresh change to an otherwise two dimensional race. Sadly, as is the case with all other Trek series, the crew are still mostly caricatures in need of further development during the first season. Despite this, everyone has a positive and hopeful outlook for the future which does a good job of reflecting the attitudes of our current space program, and makes the crew seem more believable. This outlook will gradually change through the series as the Enterprise team encounters greater challenges and threats to their survival.

Overall, this is a decent first season by Star Trek standards, and sets the stage for lots of interesting storylines and character development which will take place later in the series.",1414368000,,1053,5.086705202312139

2243003,3,B0007TKH66,"Each Star Trek show had a different appeal to them and that's true of Enterprise as well.  TNG had a lot of morality,  ethics and quandaries.  DS9 had politics,  intrigue and the delicate balance of power between major factions with the shifting lines called ""allies"" ever fluctuating.  Voyager was about being lost, making the best of tough situations,  resiliency,  ingenuity,  tenacity and perseverance.

The thing about Enterprise that can throw people off is that it's set before Kirk, Spock and Bones are even around.  The setting is even before there is a United Federation of Planets at all.  This is interesting because we are seeing how Starfleet came into existence,  why is there a Prime Directive at all and how did humans (who started out so far behind the curve) get to be so prevalent in the future.

By far,  the worst thing about this entire show,  bar none,  is the intro song.  I'm not kidding.  Is relevant to the show, so watch it once for the lyrics and the interesting montage of all the Enterprises in history,  but then you'll see what I mean.",1412812800,,1069,4.681081081081081
2243004,4,B0007TKH66,"Like all Trek's, Enterprise starts out a little forced and over the top, but the stories and the cast/crew do a fine job of conveying Trek's beginnings.

The four stars are in spite of the beginning title music, which lyrically fits but is melodically a horrible fit for a Trek title (I'm sure Paramount effed that up somehow), and the end title piece makes me race to the mute button. It is so bad, that I want Paramount to hire Jerry Goldsmith to re-score it to make up the blunder (his Trek work has been wonderful, especially the Voyage theme).

Enterprise was definitely cut short in it's prime, and was treated poorly in the end in spite of the excellent story telling and production.",1412467200,,690,4.556451612903226

But, I guess time heals all wounds.  I did record the first season and some of the final season, too.  But, the tape I had of the First Season was, well terrible.  So, I bit the bullet and bought this DVD collection.

Like all star trek shows and movies, they stand out from all the other sci fi stuff by the insights into human nature they provide.  This show, like all the rest, gives us a glimpse at what human life can be like when we all work together sharing information and getting rid of the destructive money controlled, war mongering that has infected our current society at the governmental, corporate and banking levels.

The characters are really interesting and it's fun to watch them struggle to formulate the Prime Directive while venturing forth in a somewhat archaic ship.

2243116,2,B0007TKH66,"I have to admit it: I'm a Trekkie. I very much enjoy the Original Series, the Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine. I even enjoy reading the novels. However, the Star Trek universe began to sour for me with the arrival of Captain Janeway and the Vulcan who wouldn't stop frowning. I stopped watching Voyager at all in the later seasons and even chose to ignore the series finale entirely. So I had high hopes when Enterprise came out. Those hopes soon tanked, though, starting with the opening credits. Years later, I decided to give this series a second try, seeing as I enjoy most of the other series so much. I came to like the song used for the opening credits in the first two seasons. However, with the exception of a couple of characters, I found most of the people in this cast either thoroughly unlikable or barely developed. Captain Archer struck me as uppity and self-righteous in most episodes in the first couple of seasons, so much so that I sometimes couldn't bear to watch an episode all the way to the end. Then, especially starting in Season 3, he was always angry; he even spoke gruffly to his cute little dog, Porthos, for cryin' out loud. Hoshi Sato seems to me like a whiny brat who has no business on a starship. Poor Mayweather had little or no substance to him at all. Several episodes seemed to have no point, like ""Shuttlepod One"" and ""Two Days and Two Nights"" in Season 1. And for anyone concerned with continuity in the Star Trek universe, this series dashes all that to pieces, complete with an appearance by the Ferengi in Season 1 and one by the Borg in Season 2.

Variations of Star Trek were on the small screen for fourteen years straight before this series came along and killed the TV franchise dead. It's that bad. I'm convinced it only survived four seasons because of Trekkies who would support any and all things Trek, regardless of the quality (or lack thereof).

I have found the series to be much more entertaining watching this second time around. When the episodes first aired on television, I believe that I was much too critical of the acting and dialog of the series to really enjoy watching. This time I take everything in based on the stories, and for a television series, the storyline has been interesting and entertaining, with references back to previous episodes, and crew discoveries of people and places we were already familiar with from the older series'.

2243150,5,B0007TKH66,"This is my favorite Trek. If the internet was around longer, I'm sure the other series would have been nitpicked and over analyzed off the air. The cast plays their roles very well, it doesn't feel like everyone is just playing a part in a sense more realistic.

I thoroughly enjoyed their use of multiple part stories, and season long story arcs that progress with each episode during their missions as it gave a greater incentive to keep watching.

When I read other negative reviews, I can't help but wonder if they aren't just upset this wasn't season 8 of The Next Generation/Deep Space 9, both of which were not as spectacular as they are hyped.

If you want to watch an engaging Star Trek that shows how humans crawled into warp speed out of Earth, and keep up with the crew without episodes that are ""different"" adventures each time, this is your trek!",1407196800,,860,4.571428571428571

Checked the disk; checked several other dvds in the same player (no problem).  Tried the disc in another player--no go.  It seems that this is just simply an issue with dvds.  (I've had this happen twice before with other discs/sets...but many others are/were fine).  I'm starting to lean toward going to digital downloads.  It's a hassle to return to the store or even print a return ticket.  Digital downloads, the media would never be an issue...and it's easier to download again if it came to that than wait and wait 'til I could get new discs.  Disappointed.

As for the content: Star Trek Enterprise is really great.  It's not quite The Next Generation (which is in my opinion the best of all the series); but I give Enterprise (the show) a commendable 4 stars.  It's a great prequel...if your disks work.",1406419200,,914,4.580246913580247

The first 2 seasons was like a slow loving train that was in search of it's way.  Thankfully season 3 began to get good and season 4 rocked it hard!  I was very annoyed after I was thoroughly beginning to groove on this series, UPN the nightmare that was a network dropped it's support of the show and cancelled it way before it's chance to hit it's prime.

If the writers/producers had pushed that storyline to it's inevitable conclusion, they would have had a blank slate from which they could build a new universe.

The characters were portrayed as accurately as possible from former Star Trek series. I gave it 5 stars because it deserved it, and it lived up to the Star Trek reputation. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact it was on for only 4 seasons and that was in part to the fact that the producers of the series got greedy and wanted to pit it against some other top TV series on another day instead of keeping it where it was, but you know how it went, they changed the time and day and within a couple of weeks to a month the series failed. I think if they had left it in the time and day slot it originally was in it would have gone another 3 years. People plan the shows around their activities, so on certain days they know what is coming on and appropriate for that time.",1401840000,,889,4.056818181818182

It's staged about 100 years after the warp engine was invented and Earth was still being watched over by the Vulcans.  Their ""Q"" is a race of humanoids that are interested in evolving at a break neck pace and cause trouble over the whole series until the show is canceled.

You are not beat up in each episode with a morality play and told how you should think. It's pure SF at it's best.

This is also the series that has the hottest Vulcan science officer for a little shot of sexual tension. ;)",1401235200,,561,4.264150943396227

But it somehow manages to be engaging and watchable.  The characters are more like real people than the larger-than-life or weirder-than-life members of the other series, and the friendships are well-played and believable.  The danger and drama work, and there is a background theme of humanity growing up and finding its special skills.

2243262,5,B0007TKH66,"Yes, there were some really lame episodes. But we have some really good stuff too. The last two episodes of season 4 are the 2nd and 3rd lamest. The one with Tripp and Malcom stranded in a shuttle pod is almost unwatchable. OTOH, there was some real promise in Season 4 as we see the foundations of the Federation built.  The introduction of the Romulans first as having an agent provocateur on Vulcan and then their drone ship were very interesting even if the technology and story line are inconsistent with ST:TOS. The wrap-up of the xindi war was a bit dragged out of a story that occupied the entire season 3. Season 4 opener finishes the Temporal Cold War (or does it? we see no further reference to it in season 4 anyway but it's that time travel thing...); a time war, as we've seen in Doctor Who, can drag on and on resuming when you thought you'd finally finished.
The mirror universe...I suppose they had to visit that at some point because it comes up in ST:TOS and several times in ST:DS9 but did we need 2 episodes of it? Yes, very nice to connect the inter-universe breach to the Tholians and yes, nice to see more about the Tholians.but no connection to the positive universe...the 2nd of these episodes had some real problems.
Overall, I thought it was excellent and I greatly enjoyed many of the episodes.",1399766400,,1323,4.5125

Another thing I like about the show is that they tried to connect the current time the show was aired with the acting and the stage they were on. For instance you can see that the using flatscreen monitors something at the time that was new, also some scenes like in the first episode had connections with current America like the farm in episode one.

The reason I give the show five stars is because I feel that it tried to make a connection with the audience at the time. I recommend this show for fans of Star Trek that would be interested in an enterprise that tries to connect to a little realism but still keep what people like about Star Trek.",1396396800,,901,4.4156626506024095

However, after finally deciding to watch episodes of Next Generation on BBC America I became interested. I've attempted to watch other Star Trek series and while they had merit, I did not enjoy them as much as Next Generation. I finally started watching Enterprise and was surprised how quickly I became hooked. I have been told by avid Trek fans that this series was a disappointment. However, I think it was fantastic. If you are fairly new to Star Trek like me and do not have many opinions on how the Trek Franchise should be, you should thoroughly enjoy this series.",1394928000,,672,4.608333333333333

Then I watched episode one, liked the characters, the plotting, and the effects.  Kept watching, and really began to wonder how I had let this series slip by the first time.

In addition to very good acting and writing, I like the toning down of aggressive political correctness that spoiled VOYAGER for me.  You can see the same kind of pedantic, hypersensitive PCness in NEXT GENERATION in the first couple of seasons, then it gets toned way down there too.

So now my order of ST series favorites is OS, NG, ENTERPRISE, DS9, and, way, way down, VOYAGER.",1394841600,,729,4.708661417322834

Seriously though, the plots cover the low end ot Star Trek plots - from ridiculous to formulaic. Nothing of the quality of ""The Inner Light' or ""The Survivors' in ST:TNG, ""The City at the edge of Forever"" from the original ST, or ""Duel"" from DS9. (I can't recall any memorable plots from ST Voyager.)

And the cast is bare-bones and poorly delilneated. There are only 7 characters, and by the end of the season there was no real character development in the Chief Engineer or the Armory Officer. The women and the doctor were somewhat better than cardboard characters, but the Captain and the Pilot(?) were ciphers. While photon torpedos and space battles may satisfy some, character development and actors' abilities are necessary for longevity. The original Star Trek and ST:TNG had it, DS9 and ST:Voyager not so much, and' ST Enterprise' not at all.",1394236800,,1093,4.967213114754099

2243344,5,B0007TKH66,"While many people may disagree with the headline of this opinionated review; this is my favorite of all the Star Trek Series.  I love The Next Generation and Voyager and I give ultimate respect to the original series; I see Deep Space 9 as nothing more than a footnote to the Trek Universe.  I was never been a big fan of the original series but became a great fan of the original cast because the motion pictures.  The original show Star Trek wasn't my cup of tea but I can't ignore what they and Gene Roddenberry did to create this universe.  As far as Enterprise goes; the direction to have a series prequel was a great concept.  The only downfall is that there were only four seasons.  In seeing how they integrated what eventually became landmarks on the shows previous to Enterprise (i.e. the Prime directive, Red Alert, the birth of the Federation) was cool to see how they saw the birth of those things.  Season two is even better and the beginning of Season Three and some of the episodes in Season Three were great but there were a lot that dropped off because of a season long story line.  Season Four was also great and showed us how they were gaining their footing again when the short lived series was ended.  I wish there were more seasons or at least a movie with the cast and the first Captain of the Starship Enterprise.  If you haven't seen the series you should.  If you don't agree with me that's OK but re-watch the series with the other series in mind and make the connections and how they were integrated into the more contemporary series and recent movies like ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek: Into Darkness.""  Play close attention to the episode in Season Two called ""Regeneration"" which deals with the Borg that Captain Picard and his crew destroyed in ""First Contact.""  In season four pay attention to the ""Augments"" and the three episode mini series with Brent Spiner that explains what will eventually result in Data and explains Khan in both the original ""Wrath of Khan"" and ""Into Darkness.""",1394064000,,2017,4.569444444444445

2243352,5,B0007TKH66,"What can you say, it was the beginning story of the Enterprise Ship and it's crew.. Scott Bakula and Jolene Blalock, played good lead characters. Blalock brought a strength and vulnerability to the Vulcan role, as T-POL. You could see her evolution of holding fast to her Vulcan heritage, but adapted to use some of the Human ideals, depending on the situation. Jonathan Archer was a strong leader, always trying to bring fairness and justice to the situations he encountered. A true Trekkie fan would like this show because it showed a time and technology, from before the Captain Kick era, and how technology and procedures evolved into the next-generation of Star Trek!",1393372800,,672,4.95575221238938

Some of the acting was a bit campy, but it was pretty good overall.  I definitely liked T'Pol and the suspicious relationship with the Vulcans.  However, they do seem somewaht wimpy -- bad guys would charge weapons or lock on and they'd just wait until they were shot to do anything (if then).  I had hoped it'd be a bit ""grittier,"" with a troublesome technology, etc than it was.",1393372800,,525,4.542553191489362

I think the problem I had was that it was a bit different from ST:TOS or ST:TNG.

Nothing else to say except to watch this series without any preconceived notions about how things compare to the Star Trek world. All the mistakes made by Star Fleet begin in this series.

Some of the episodes, like Terra Nova, were standard out of the can stories, but it was nice to see them show the Andorians as more human-like and perhaps a more natural ally than the Vulcans.  The idea of Vulcan logic being used to fuel a cold blooded and not always pacifist society probably hadn't occurred to anyone before.  Though the Temporal Cold War was the usual junk that the non-SF fans think is SF, Fortunate Son, Sleeping Dogs, and Shuttlepod One are all worth watching.",1393113600,,576,4.627450980392157

2243370,5,B0007TKH66,ST Enterprise in my opinion is the best star trek. Sadly cut short but the episodes aren't the typically ST Next Gen goody goody we can't break the rules. Scott Bakula is a great Captain and ohhh T'pol is a great Vulcan as well as eye candy,1392768000,,240,4.127659574468085
2243371,5,B0007TKH66,Great show! Wonderful characters. The story lines within each segment carry forward to the next segment.  It is a very linear show and not just a series of stand-alone fragmented episodes. Very entertaining.

The time travel stuff they mix in, though, is bizarre. Watch it, its enjoyable.",1392681600,,385,4.594202898550725

2243375,5,B0007TKH66,"Love the opening theme song and images. They so very much ""fit"" what the Star Trek saga has always been about: progress driven by ""faith of the heart"".  Love the way the human spirit of adventure and ""let's go for it"" attitude is contrasted with Vulcan reserve and cautiousness. And Scott Bakula's character of Captain Archer is just plain likable and easy-going. A welcome addition to the also great characters of Kirk, Picard, Sisko, and Janeway.",1392681600,,448,4.894736842105263
2243376,5,B0007TKH66,"I think this came out after a lot of other ST tv series had ran. It seems the series released at a rough time to pick up new viewers even though it was a solid new take. I regret never watching it when it first aired, but a few years back I started watching it on Netflix and was hooked! The only thing stopping me from purchasing sets is that the last episode was a slap in the face to fans :( I wish they would do a tv movie to wrap this up properly, or even give it another 2-3 year run based on the success of the movie franchise. That is however wishful thinking. If you haven't seen the show, it is definitely a worthwhile investment of your time!",1392595200,,653,3.9923664122137406

2243378,3,B0007TKH66,I have read many reviews of the show.  If you like SyFy you will be ok.  If you are looking for Star Trek magic I think it falls a bit short.  I don't take the show too seriously so what I can say about the series is that it is very formulaic... Enterprise meets new friendly alien...New Alien turns out to be bad guy or still practices out dated human taboos...Enterprise tries to fix things.  The first season gets a bit long in the tooth with that formula.  It's an ok show while doing laundry.  Oh yeah...Hate the opening Theme song.,1392336000,,537,4.267326732673268

2243384,2,B0007TKH66,"I was hoping there would be a little bit of the old Star Trek magic to get me interested in this show so I stuck with it through 2 seasons of DVDS. I'm not sure I'll give it anymore time. I can't think of an episode that was interesting enough that I minded when there was an interruption, or would stay up a little late to finish. And, the more I watch the more annoying the characters become. The only person more irritable than the chief engineer (""Trip"") is the captain, and he has become intolerable. His heroism is defined by getting his way and ending an episode less annoyed with his predicaments than he is in mid-show. Was this the formula all along? If so, I missed it. I can't say there are any other interesting characters in the show. The Vulcan is what one would expect from past incarnations, but her physical attributes are exaggerated at times almost to level of being farcical.",1391817600,,896,4.4363636363636365
2243385,5,B0007TKH66,"I watched once only the first episode of the ""new"" Star Trek Serie which is a pre-quel to the original ""classic"" series from 1966. I didn't liked it for some reason. One reason was the terrible ""Main Theme"".
The Story/serie ""Enterprise"" is somewhere located between the movie ""Star Trek: The First Contact"" and the classic Serie and tells the story of the first flight to space. The captain is John Archer, played by Scott Backula.

I thought I give now a new chance and buy the Blu-Ray and hey... its better than i thought (ok, the song/ main-theme is still terrible). There is a story-line through the whole season which makes for me interesting to keep my interest.

Sure, one problem is (from the technical point/view) that this ""Enterprise"" looks more modern (Computer, Monitor etc.) than of Captain Kirks one but they didn't had in 1966 any computers like we have ""today"". Anyway.. that doesn't matter.

Interesting are any special guests: in a recurring role can be seen Vaughn Armstrong and Jeffrey Combs (""Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"") and other guests like Clint Howard (who appeared already as child-actor in the ""classic"" serie). Behind the camera on the directors chair are other Star Trek Veterans: Roxann Dawson, LeVar Burton, Jonathan Frakes, Robert Duncan McNeill etc.

The stories are entertaining, interesting (ok, here and then are a few terrible episodes - even Brannon Braga says this in the interviews/extras).

The Blu-Ray (US)-Set is CODEFREE and contains with English also German Track (inkl. a german Menu and Subtitles).

This Set contains several intersting Bonus-Features:
On selected episodes: Text commentaries, audio-commentaries
Deleted Scnes
Archive Docu/Makin-Ofs/Interviews (from the previously released DVD's)
and also new Conversation between Rick Berman/Brannon Braga and Interviews (both speaking today critical abouth ""Enterprise"" and they say that they made something wrong).

The Text-Commentaries (a kind of Trivias) are interesting. Sadly the Audio-Commentaries are NOT subtitled.

The Picture und Sound-Quality are VERY good.

FAZIT: interesting, entertaining which keep my interest - I will buy definitive the other seasons on BD too.

GERMAN:

Dieses US-Blu-Ray Release ist CDEFREI und enhtlt nebst englisch Ton auch deutsche Sprache, sowie deutsche Untertitel und deutsches Menu.

Fr die Audio-Kommentare gibt es leider keine Untertitel.

Bildqualitt und Sound sind sehr gut.

Das Bonus-Material kann sich sehen lassen. Nebst den bereits verffentlichen Material (auf den vorhering DVD-Release) gibt es eine Konversation zwischen Berman/Braga, welche nict nur lobdudelei von sich geben, sondern auch ziemlich kritisch ber ""Enterprise"" sprechen, ber das, was sie falsch gemacht haben bei der Entwicklung der Geschichten (was sicherlich nicht einfach war).

FAZIT: abgesehen von einigen Episoden die daneben gingen, gibt es einen Storybogen durch die Staffel, die doch recht spannend ist und zu unterhalten weiss.",1391731200,,2959,5.573660714285714

It was nice to see the beginnings of the Federation and Starfleet and also good to see the struggles they faced building a future for Earth.  The following seasons also built on this storyline showing the hardships and doubts the orginal crew went through.  It is too bad that Paramont deciced to drop the series because the Star Trek franchise, (all of them), are probably the most beloved series ever shown on TV.  The actors and the series from each branch of the franchise will be sorely missed.

I liked Scott Bakula as Captain Archer and I enjoyed the other actors that played the supporting cast. I think Enterprise is worthy of your time and attention, if you haven't seen it before. Favorite episode from Season 1 is ""Dear Doctor"" and it's probably a good place to start for anyone new to this series.  If you watch that episode, and like it, then I think you would enjoy the remainder of the season.  If not, then perhaps this brand of Star Trek isn't your cup of tea.",1391385600,,617,4.5
2243404,5,B0007TKH66,This show was enjoyable to watch when it was on. It got canceled after 4 years or so. The later seasons got more SoapOperaEsk. It is a good watch if you enjoy Star Trek. It takes place about 100 years after warp discovery on Earth. So is still before the time line of the original series. I miss Star Trek and I hope that they reengineer a new Star Trek series soon.,1390953600,,366,4.097222222222222

The acting felt stiff and forced, it got marginally better as the series went on but for me at least, it just doesn't have that ""soul"" the other Star Treks' carry.

But the vulcan female character is so annoying that I have a hard time watching the shows. Just the fact that she has the most ridiculously puffed up fake lips (and the other fake parts) that are such a distraction and you cannot help but cringe whenever she is onscreen her portrayal of a vulcan is smug, superior and angry. Really, really annoying ... no one has portrayed a vulcan as well as Leonard Nimoy but this character is extremely off puttiing.

Scott Bakula playing a tough, no-nonsense captain? The only worse choice would have been Corey Feldman, and the way this show was handled I'm guessing they tried to get him but failed.

This series is awful in every way. I'll put up with all the absurd plots you throw my way, but if you commit the cardinal sin of making your characters insufferable and/or boring, you've lost me. What a debacle.",1389398400,3,545,4.677083333333333

I actually started skipping ahead 1 min and 20 seconds when it started.  I thought they would fix this in season 2, but no...plan on hearing a lot of this awful intro.
The puerto rican vulcan chick is super hot, although I'm pretty sure that tan vulcans are not part of the original Star Trek cannon.  She also seems to have a lot of ""emotions"".
I lost interest in a couple of episodes, but on the whole I think this is a must watch for anyone who enjoys the Star Trek universe.",1389312000,,601,4.283185840707965

As for Sub-Commander T'Pol, well her roll is already defined as the 7 of nine eye candy clone.  And I do like looking at her..  She's no Jeri Ryan, but still vow vow voooom,  The captain needs a bit more character development as I find him a bit out of place...  Other than that I think the story line has a lot of potential.

It is too sad that, with the dawn of the wars we began waging, the producers of the Show were pressured they should find their own ""Terrorists"" in Space, and follow a storyline which culminated in the Zindi blowing up a planet, (4th Season), and destroying great chunks of Earth, rendering it uninhabitable.

Nonetheless, the first two Seasons of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" are indeed a Joy to Watch, and  hopefully, my DVD and Player will last for a long time to come.

This is a Keeper, for sure.",1384646400,2,1113,4.806282722513089

2243492,5,B0007TKH66,"I thought it set up the next or oldest series very well.  As a prequil it hit all the marks and explaind some of the history well.  Acting by Scott Bakula was great.  Jolene Blalock was good, a little flat in delivery but then she did play a Vulcan.  The supporting cast was ok, whoever played the Doctor wore his makeup very well.  Interesting stories at first, the 2nd and 3rd seasons were a little rough.  But it had a one of the best endings of a series.",1384214400,,458,4.1477272727272725

2243494,5,B0007TKH66,Good quality DVD. Really enjoyed watching the episodes. Excellent acting and filmography.  Very creative science fiction series.  Good clean entertainment!,1384041600,,155,6.7
2243495,5,B0007TKH66,"Let me preface this by saying that I never really watched the original Star Trek.  I've seen the occasional episodes (enough to know about the universe Star Trek exists in) but have never watched it from beginning to end.  Then again, the beginning of The Original Series predates my date of birth by over 20 years.  Maybe one of these days I'll get into it but not before I finish Enterprise.

This series is pretty amazing.  The premise of it is that it's the middle of the 22nd century and Earth's Starfleet has finally developed their first ever Warp 5 capable starship, the Enterprise, designation NX-01.  In this age, the crew is afraid of the transporter (""what if it doesn't put your molecules back together right?""), shuttlepods are used to get from Enterprise to a planet and airlocks are still heavily used, phase pistols are brand new (there are only 15 of them in existence, all of them aboard the Enterprise), and polarizing the ship's hull is the only way to prevent against catastrophic damage to the ship, with shielding still in development.  The Vulcans believe that humans are far too emotional and illogical to be in deep space, and actively try to hold them back.  Vulcan mind-melds are considered taboo and those who perform them are looked down upon.  It's a strange world for anyone who has seen even a little of the original series, but most of the differences are gradually and artistically resolved throughout the series; commendation should really be given to the writers for the great work they did presenting an almost unrecognizable past to Star Trek and then resolving it throughout the series to the universe The Original Series existed in.

The series, so far, is very well written and directed.  The episodes are entertaining and thoughtful.  If you enjoy science fiction, you'll definitely enjoy this series.",1383696000,,1845,4.878205128205129

Besides just being very well, and originally written, the show pays brilliant homage to the ""future"" world of the original Star Trek series.  References to mundane factors of life on contemporary earth; trepidation with certain fledgling technologies; human introduction and interaction with new species; as well as the very nature of the Enterprise's mission all provide just the right feel to give even the most serious fan the sensation he's watching a preliminary to Roddenberry's classic.  Additionally, actors are extraordinarily well cast, and don't ""overplay"" their roles as with some...earlier...spin-offs.

Immediately when opening the case I noticed the disks were loose inside the case. They basically put an entire season of 6 disks into a one disk case.  All the disks visually looked fine though.  I was also unable to put the disk back into the case without them falling out while trying to close it.  Poor design and cheep construction.

Two episodes on disk four did not work.  The disk was free from scratches or any sort of visual damage.  I can only guess it is a manufacturing problem but I guess it's possible it was damaged during shipping.

I think I will stick with the DVD version of the series for now.  The Blu-Ray version wasn't a whole lot better quality and isn't worth the sloppy packaging job and disks that don't play for the higher price tag.  I'm sure since this is there first run at HD there is due to be some hiccups and they will iron out the bugs down the road.",1379376000,2,1064,4.217821782178218

When Archer is mad at T'Pol it is just so funny.  0-60 ha ha!

 To the die hard fans let me reassure you this is NOT quantum leap all over again.  Although in the episode Detained one could make that argument because Dean Stockwell also stars in that episode.

 There are moments that cross between QL/NG on this show because the way Archer and Tucker act toward each other throughout the series.

2243554,4,B0007TKH66,"Bottom Line: The first two seasons are as good as any of the Star Trek franchise. The third season is very poor, but the fourth season rebounds with the exception of the final episode. Many will be disturbed by the way that this series introduces new topics into the Star Trek timeline. However, if you can get past that issue; the first two seasons are as thought provoking as any of the Star Trek TV shows. The third season, which may have been written as an artistic response to the traumatic events of 11 Sep 2001, seem downright un-Trek-like in their content. The fourth season is pretty solid, but never reaches the quality of the first two seasons.

Plot issues:
 It is exceedingly hard to do a ""prequel"" for a franchise like Star Trek. The ""lore"" and ""background"" of the Star Trek universe is so well established that slight deviations, the first encounter with the Klingons, the Temporal Cold War, and the discovery of the Borg almost seem like emotional betrayals to even the casual fan. However, it is what it is and I would recommend that the viewer just accept the stories at face value.

 Third season: The whole Xendi as terrorism storyline seemed contrived and overdone. I think if Enterprise had only allowed a handful of episodes to address the 9/11 attacks vice a whole season, then it would have been much more entertaining. On a side note, I have always mocked Rodenberry's idealized take on humanity in the Star Trek universe. It was pretty sobering to see how bad the franchise could be without that as, at least, a goal that all humans strived for. Seeing the Star Trek universe give into the fear and hate that briefly consumed America after 9/11 was a bit disturbing and not in an artistically satisfying way.

The thing I like best about Enterprise is the character development. All of the characters seem like real people with real flaws that influence their actions for both good and bad.

CAPT Archer: He is the son of one of the men who perfected the Warp Drive. As such, he is somewhat of a golden child, handpicked to be the first Star Ship captain and promoted past his peers, most notably a girlfriend - his promotion destroys or at least delays the relationship until she also becomes a Star Ship captain - and his good friend, Trip, the ship's engineer. As another reviewer has pointed out, he is basically a good person but struggles with some real character issues. He is forced by circumstances to act in ways he finds morally repugnant but simultaneously realizes that he must put aside his resentment of Vulcans to succeed in his current role.

T'Pol: She is the token Vulcan. Along with the ship's doctor, she is intended to reflect the eventual multi-species nature of Star Fleet.  After she became infected and later addicted to a neurological toxin, her emotional indulgences had a plausible storyline.  I found the storylines dealing with the correct interpretation of Vulcan philosophy to be very interesting and among some of the better episodes in the series. At some point, T'Pol permanently leaves the Vulcan High Command and becomes a permanent Star Fleet Officer.

CDR Charles ""Trip"" Tucker: Trip, to this reviewer, fills the role of rambunctious swashbuckler that CAPT Kirk had in the original Star Trek. Without the expectations of command, he is free to indulge in both the worst and best aspects of his personality. In many ways, Trip is a tragic character. He loses his family when Earth is attacked. His relationship with T'Pol doesn't really amount to anything. CAPT Archer's friendship grows more formal and distant as time goes by. His devotion to the Enterprise is really the only thing this smart, friendly, and generous man has going for him.

Malcolm Reed: Something just isn't right about this guy. He strikes me as the sort of person who joined Star Fleet looking for something, not realizing that the thing he was looking for was to fill the emotional void that he, perhaps, doesn't even realize is destroying his life. A smart, competent, and competitive individual,  Malcolm focuses on his work. His inability to form close and meaningful relationships is very poignant. In one episode, the Enterprise crew meets a future version of Enterprise. Malcolm realizes that he dies alone without a wife and a child.

Dr. Phlox: He is the ship's doctor. An alien on earth to participate in a Vulcan multi-species physician exchange program, he is recruited to be the ship's doctor by CAPT Archer since he, unlike any Star Fleet doctor, has at least seen a Klingon, albeit a deceased one. This expertise is essential for the Enterprise's first mission. His disposition, friendly nature, and genuine interest in the crew make the stories that focus on him highly enjoyable.",1376265600,,4735,4.8236744759556105

2243571,5,B0007TKH66,Enterprise could have been the ST franchise's most interesting series too bad Rick Berman & company failed to capitalized on it. The Vulcans should have been included right from the get go instead of the temporal cold war and the boring Zenis aliens. The 4th season is of course the high light of the series by then it was too little too late and Berman completely ruined the series finale(every Trekies know what I am referring to).

In both cases the first disc had a clear glue like sticky coating completely covering the printed side of the disc. It would stick right to your hand. Every other disc in the package was fine and did not have this issue. It leads me to believe that someone at the manufacturing plant must have run off an entire batch of bad first discs. I am writing this to warn buyers of what they may experience. Thankfully Amazon was willing to help with this issue, and allowed me to return the defective sets. I already purchased season 2 and it had no such problem. Now I need season 1, but I guess I will wait until current stocks have been sold out, or purchase it direct from a store where I can open it at time of purchase, and deal with it on the spot if it has the same issue.

Every episode is filled with exploring brave new worlds, seeking out New life and new civilizations, etc. (you know the rest). It is this series that explains how warp drive works. Not to mention the overarching storyline of a species bent on changing the very fabric of space-time. The Enterprise series is written brilliantly, with believable acting, and never degenerates into a soap opera set in outer space.

Like all of the ST seasons, it has its highs & lows, but overall the series does an excellent job of recognizing the trajectory shown between all the series and effectively projecting it backwards, to establish a history and tone that feel right in pre-dating the original series. Given that it is now the only series that remains canon in the new ST continuity (with the movies introducing an alternative timeline), it is worth watching as it remains a logical lead-in to the 2009 and 2013 movies. Overall a great set of stories pre-dating the creation of the United Federation of Planets in the ST universe.",1374364800,,774,4.535714285714286

2243615,4,B0007TKH66,i was never a fan of which direction they took Star Trek after Voyager and Deep Space Nine.  So i hver followed the new series much until i had the oppurtunity to watch it on Amazon Prime (Note: the plug for Amazon Prime). i watch much of the 4 seasons I think it was a real good series. In fact it deserved at least one more season. Season 4 seemed like they were cramming 2 season into 1,1374019200,,389,3.9871794871794872
2243616,4,B0007TKH66,"I enjoyed watching this.  However it was much different than I expected of a 'Star Trek' show.  The humans though intelligent and dedicated use even more 'cowboy' diplomacy than even James T Kirk.  They succeed despite themselves in some occasions and brilliantly in other situations.  The show makes Vulcan's appear to be closer to their emotions than the other series and other aliens seem a bit aloof in the beginning but are won over by the humans in time.

Two very charming aspects of the series is Dr. Phlox and the Captain's dog Porthos.  The doctor has a merry disposition and is different than your typical 'alien'.  The methods he uses to treat the crew are both unusual and reasonable.  In a way it would be like a medieval herbalist in the future.

Scott Bakula plays Captain Archer a man in great need to succeed.  He has a bias against Vulcans whom he feels have been holding humanity back and thus did a disservice to his father (one of the scientists who developed space travel technology.  I loved Mr. Bakula in other shows and know him to be a great actor.  This role however was not ideal for him as he comes across as a gentle person even when angry.  I do not mistake gentle for weak in this, but he did not always seem as forceful as he should.

One very detracting aspect of the show was the costuming for the Vulcan Science Officer.  While the rest of the crew wore loose fit uniforms, she was wearing very snug outfits.  No other Vulcan was portrayed in this manner and it seemed a disservice to the actress to have her thus attired.

The show starts rather slow but picks up momentum with each episode. I would watch it again, but not as often as I would Voyager or ST:TNG.

Enjoy the show but do not put too many preconceptions into play when you do.",1373846400,,1778,4.435185185185185

2243630,5,B0007TKH66,"When Enterprise debuted in the fall of 2001 we had come off of having Star Trek on TV starting with The Next Generation which begat Deep Space Nine which begat Voyager while also having several Star Trek movies in the theaters. Star Trek had saturated our media culture for over a decade and there was obviously some franchise fatigue that had set in with the tepid reception for Enterprise. Enterprise survived four seasons rather than the expected seven enjoyed by the previous three series. It is typically the most critically dissed of the Star Trek series and dismissed by many fans as being a misstep for the franchise. I enjoyed the series when it first ran but didn't have the same regard for it that I did TNG and DS9. So it was good to be able to revisit this series via Amazon. Watching Enterprise again has given me a greater appreciation for just how good the characters and stories were once separated from the other series. Season 1 of Enterprise has surprisingly few poor episodes and the overall quality is high. Broken Bow starts the series off with a bang with the best premiere for the franchise. We then get to see how Earth finally moved out of the shadow of Vulcan supervision to become a leader in the politics of the quadrant and in exploring ""strange new worlds."" I really enjoyed exploring how our relationship with the Vulcans evolved with the complication of dealing with the Andorians and being a buffer between these species. Then you had the introduction of the Suliban and the Temporal Cold War. In watching this series again (all four seasons back to back) this story arc worked for me. It was an interesting way to bring in the future of the Federation hinging on the actions of Captain Archer and the crew of the Enterprise. A great stand alone episode was Shuttlepod One which helped bond the characters of Trip and Malcolm for the duration of the series. Season 1 set a solid foundation for the success of this series. It is just a shame that Enterprise didn't get the full seven-year run that it deserved.",1373155200,,2044,4.633608815426998

Other streamed shows don't have this issue.,1373068800,,346,4.548387096774194

2243635,3,B0007TKH66,"TNG will always be my star trek of choice.  Picard and the rest of the crew were absolutely perfect in my opinion.  Enterprise is good and I am currently watching the whole series for the first time, but it isn't even close to TNG level.  I think my two biggest negatives on the show are the two stars.  I really don't mind Scott Backula as an actor, but I don't think he fits into this role.  Not only that, but his character doesn't really fit either.  He is suppose to be a captain of the best ship in Star Fleet and yet he acts like he didn't even go to college(head engineer has the same issue).  He has very limited leadership skills and constantly does things that don't seem right for someone who presumably has been in Star Fleet for X amount of years preparing to lead a crew of elite men and women into the unknown.  Refer to Picard for what a captain should really be like.  The Vulcan is also out of place in this show.  I think her character is ok, but the actor is not.  She is clearly there to sell sex for the show and attract men to watch it.  Sex is not what Star Trek is about.  Why is there a female Vulcan walking around in a skin tight suit with double d's?  It is just weird and takes me out of the show everytime I see her.  It is illogical for Vulcans to be that sexual.  They should be pretty dull and boring in their appearance since they have evolved past having emotions.  Not to mention Vulcan parents choose mates for their children and they only have sex like 6 days out of the year(don't have human biology/aren't looking for sex all the time like humans).  There is no reason for Vulcans to show sexuality.  Apparently you can get breast implants on Vulcan though.  I hope with the movies being out now, they will create another series. Unfortunately, they will probably continue the trend of over sexualizing it  and making the crew act slightly smarter than a bag of rocks.  I am sorry Gene for what they have done to your baby.",1372204800,,1965,4.2682926829268295

I think it is funny how Tripp and T'Pol are such opposites and T'Pol gets under his skin!  At first I didn't like Scott Bakula as the captain, but he his growing on me.  His simple, almost cowboy responses have a human quality to them that would be very realistic for the first captain of the first warp 5 starship.  I think Enterprise NX-01 is a really cool design.  The sets have a metallic quality to them that seems to be more realistic than the stark white or beige of some of the other starships.  Weapon systems are cool as well.

2243682,4,B0007TKH66,"Several of these episodes are really good, while others are at least interesting. Like many of my friends, I was excited that there was a new Star Trek series on when Enterprise first aired, and I liked the concept. In comparison to later seasons, the characters and dynamics are still being sorted out, and there's lots of world-building going on. If you've seen it, but it's been a while, or you just want to see a few episodes, my favorites are The Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem (we see the Andorians--the blue aliens with two antennae from the original series), Fusion (which again refers back to some of the hippie themes from the original series), and Fallen Hero. Acquisition earns an honorable mention, since it's the first time humans meet Ferengi, as does Broken Bow, the pilot episode, which starts off with a rescue mission of sorts, returning a wounded Klingon home.
I was not a fan of the time war involving the Suliban and other races, a story arc that is first introduced partway through the season. For me, it was a few good ideas that didn't gel, and it was far too dark with the US looking to go to war when these stories were broadcast. Some of my friends (all Star Trek fans) just didn't care for the series in general, while the rest didn't care for the whole time war storyline. The show's characters and other stories take off in the second season, and I really think that it would have gone several more seasons, if not for the unfortunate time war story arc(s).",1369785600,,1493,4.574626865671642

Many of the episodes deal with the trials and tribulations of being the first to go where no man has gone before, but after awhile the writers appeared to grow bored with all that and simply started making action episodes. One thread that was started but minimally revisited was the need for a Prime Directive.

Frankly, the series requires much tolerance to put up with all the contradictions and unanswered questions, and the relationships between the characters created by the writers often don't reflect the interactions created between actors. Nevertheless, the crew is an interesting collection of characters with some very likeable actors.",1369785600,,771,5.062992125984252

They're still recycling all the old themes -- it's ""bad"" to help people in a bad spot if it might affect their ""natural development"".  (This is the writers trying to lay a foundation for one Star Trek's stupider creations -- the Prime Directive.)

My loss. Big time.

Because I have Amazon Prime, I'm able to watch all of the Star Trek series free. On a lark, my wife and I started Enterprise.

At first, the theme song turned us off. It sounded...well...weird. Out of place. Not in keeping with Star Trek.

But it grew on us. We actually like it now.

Then there are the characters: Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip, Malcom, Hoshi, Phlox, and Travis. At first, we thought, what a motley crew. A bunch of odd balls. Just normal people, really. We thought Trip sounded like someone doing a George Bush impression. And we thought T'Pol was hot in her chesty jumpsuits, but hardly a Vulcan as we've come to know them.

But they grew on us.

Then we started getting into the stories, as clunky and as cheesy as they seemed to be. They grew on us.

We watched all four seasons and absolutely fell in love with Star Trek: Enterprise, as it came to be called. We feel closer to these characters than any other Star Trek series. And that's saying a lot. I grew up watching the original series with Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and others. My wife loved Next Gen and thought Picard was a hunk.

For whatever reason, we now think Enterprise is our favorite of the Star Treks. I know that sounds nearly blasphemous. But it's true. Enterprise is a truly wonderful series that didn't last long enough. The characters, for all their quirks and human foibles (except for the non-humans, that is) seemed REAL. They seemed to be earnest, and wide-eyed, and sincere. They seemed like nice people. No pretense.

Season One gets off to a rocky start. Takes a bit to get into the show. But stick with it.

Season Two is our favorite season. That really rocked. Great stories. Nice character development.

Season Three is our least favorite season. Way too much about the Xindi. The entire season is one big story arc about something we just couldn't get into. This is why we think the series started to nose dive in the ratings. If you miss an episode or two in Season Three you're lost.

Season Four is back to Season Two levels...except for that horrendous last episode. We agree with others: Berman and Braga ought to be flogged for the way they treated Enterprise.

The only thing stopped me from buying Enterprise on Blu-ray is the price. This is way overpriced for what it is. If it dips to around $60, we may take the plunge. But we're not paying $75 for six Blu-rays.

If you've ever thought of taking a chance on Star Trek: Enterprise, I wholeheartedly recommend you do so. We fell in love with this series. Maybe you will, too.",1368921600,,2746,4.508064516129032

2243695,1,B0007TKH66,"For me to actually sit here and type a review can only mean one thing:
1) I absolutely LOVE something and want total strangers on the net to know, or
2) I HAVE to warn people about pending disaster, hate, evil, or if they are about to step into doodoo.

I speak not to the star trek aficionado, who will watch trek, any trek, as long as it IS trek. There will be hate, love, discussion, anger, happiness, etc amongst us who are of the trek. There is no point in telling any of us what we already know, that this show stinks.........

I am directing this to the innocent fool who never really got into star trek, but is curious of what this series has to offer. With the advent of the new hack and slash, ""let's attract as many people as we can to the franchise and give the finger to the fans"", movies that are coming out, many are probably skimming amazon to learn and digest more trek, at least I hope. If this is you, and you are reading this, immediately search for star trek deep space nine and buy that.

Listen to me, and listen carefully. Star Trek Enterprise was a prequel (and I probably need not say more) that was conceived by Satan and his disciple, namely Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. These two animals took an incredible series (or franchise as the bankers call it) and destroyed what once was magnificent social commentary set in space. This show stinks. Why? Well read the 1 star ratings and find out! Oh you won't? Why? Because you feel that those who gave it a 1 star are cynical, evil dwarves who just want to hate? Maybe. But the truth is, It really is poorly done.

Where do I begin?

Why rehash what we already know, and disrupt canon, when you could easily have explored the birth of the federation and its' member species. You want conflict? Well let there be conflict between these, instead of bringing in the romulans, the borg (!) etc.

Ira Steven Behr and Michael Piller (from ds9 and tng as well for Piller) is what is needed once again. Why won't the studio fund a 3 part mini series on the events following the dominion war to see if anyone will watch? I guarantee there will be interest. People don't like prequals (doesn't take a genius to realize this) but they do like continuity, character development, etc. Let's put it this way. The show Dallas has been off the air for umpteen years, and they just brought it back, same characters and a few new ones, to critical acclaim! What does this tell you? We want more of what we love. We want to see familiar faces. We want what works.

I can go on and on, but my fingers hurt and I'm feeling sick thinking about Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. If you see either of these cretins in the street, please profer 'the bird' to them for me. They deserve it.",1368748800,3,2735,4.330078125

2243704,2,B0007TKH66,"Although I'm financially pleased I won't have to double-dip, it was a major disappointment to check the picture of the episodes. I only watched the pilot and the following episode and to me the whole thing seemed up-converted, and I mean every scene and not only the special effects which were originally rendered in standard definition. If you rate the Next Generation Blu-rays 10 and Enterprise DVDs 5, the Enterprise Blu-rays would be at best 5.5.

I only hope that Paramount didn't do it intentionally so they have an excuse not to release Deep Space Nine and Voyager when the Enterprise Blu-rays don't sell as much as the classic series or TNG.

So if you're planning on buying this I'd suggest that you rent it first and find for yourself if it's worth the purchase. I gave this review 2 stars in respect for the show, which I really like, but the quality of the image, especially if you consider the other Star Trek shows already released on Blu-ray, is insulting.

-------------------UPDATE-------------------

Following the suggestion of another customer, I checked another episode further ahead, and although the picture does improve, I'd give it a 7.5, which doesn't come near the results they had on TOS or TNG, so I still humbly maintain that it isn't worth the upgrade unless you are really interested in the new extras or if you have money to burn.

  Enterprise is a Trek show that is in many ways the least like a Trek show.  But in the ways that matter - and they aren't always apparent - it is possibly the most Trek-like of any show since the original.  Some people thought the market was saturated with too much Trek and that is a valid point.  But I was pretty unhappy in 2005 when season 4 ended and Trek was not being produced regularly for the first time since the mid-80s.  Many fans blamed Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Well, the greatest thing about this set is that you get to watch the two ""guilty parties"" genuinely and pretty openly talk about that issue and plenty of others.  It was incredibly refreshing and humorous to hear such candor.  I loved when they ribbed Manny Coto for doing well in the 4th season since popular opinion said the two of them had ""ruined"" Trek by that point.
  Anyway, I bring that up because I think fans will be interested to hear what they have to say whether said fans agree or not.  I listened to part of the pilot commentary - the new one, the old one is on here as well - and some of the disc one extras.  The exterior visuals are spectacular in the effects shots.  The regular filming is surprisingly bad looking for Blu-ray.  Other reviewers have mentioned graininess and it is.  But they said it gets better after the pilot.  I hope so.
  I really don't care about that.  I know it's pricey, although Amazon's price is more reasonable than any others I've seen.  I got it with free shipping and it was here IN 2 DAYS!  So their service on this transaction was A++.  There are more commentaries this time around and a few more features.  All the features from the DVD release are present.  I still wish Paramount treated Star Trek with the same love and attention that the BBC shows for Doctor Who but they are doing better with their original material.  They used to have a trailer or something and that was it.  More commentaries are what I like to see.  The retrospectives are always welcome and it is great to see (or hear) any of the cast members again.  I would welcome more from the writers or producers or any of the tech people, particularly the composers.
  As for the series, you either love it or hate it.  The producers tried something different - in fact, they tried a lot of things that were different and it worked for me.  The ship was wonderfully realized on the interior and exteriors used a CGI only ship for the first time.  I enjoyed the temporal cold war.  It reminded me very much of the mythology episodes from X Files.  I had trouble with the way Vulcans were treated initially and then I began to see what they were attempting.  T'pol was a cold fish in the pilot so she could grow.  And did she ever.  I think it's one of the best casts Trek has ever had.  I do feel sorry for Anthony Montgomery.  I'm sure he's a nice guy but I don't think any actor could do much with what he was given.  All the other regulars fare better.  Many people dislike Scott Bakula and to me, that is just ludicrous.  Maybe they still see Sam Beckett.  I don't.  When I watch Quantum Leap, I ask why Archer is in a dress.  Just kidding.  I adore Jolene Blalock as T'Pol and Connor Trinneer is in character right off the bat as Trip.  I also like Dominic Keating a great deal as Malcolm Reed.  Wish he had a bit more to do as well.  Linda Park is fine as Hoshi Sato in the beginning and improved as the show went forward.  I really cared for her as well by the end of the series.  John Billingsley as Phlox was another pro who was just perfect from Day 1.  For me, the show was mostly fresh.  All Trek shows had clunkers in them.  Most of Enterprise's were in Seasons One and Two.  But even in those seasons, we had a majority of fine episodes and some great ones.
  Oh and I loved Porthos.  So there!
  Bottom line - if you missed it the first time whether broadcast or DVD, this is a no-brainer.  If like me, you enjoy behind the scenes stuff or just hanging out with these fictional characters or better yet, their real life counterparts, then this Blu-Ray set is worth it.  I figured it out to be about 3 bucks an episode.  Let's face it.  I could recite Kirk or Picard verbatim.  Archer is too recent.  I couldn't do that.  It will be nice to visit the gang again and let them know I still care.  True Trek fans who are skeptical about Enterprise and on the fence...watch it again from the beginning.  If you don't get a lump in your throat when Archer makes his speech in the next to last episode of Season 4, you aren't really a Trek fan.
  I'm sure most of you who take the plunge will enjoy it.  If not, there's plenty of other Trek out there.  Just not much more new to discover...yet.  Yes, I am eager for the new Trek film.  But as good as it looks, it's not quite Trek to me.  Star Trek needs to be on TV.  And those guys aren't.",1365724800,2,4908,4.238611713665944

2243731,2,B0007TKH66,"""Star Trek: Enterprise - Season One""  is set in the early days of the Earth's exploration of the universe.  The year is 2151 and the Vulcans have reluctantly released star charts to the humans, enabling them to navigate deep space.  Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), the commanding officer of the starship Enterprise, is a charismatic leader with an insatiable curiosity who inspires tremendous loyalty among his crew.  At the time of ""Enterprise,"" technology is not nearly as advanced as in the ""Star Trek"" series, set further in the future.  Many aspects of space travel are, for the people of Earth, works in progress.

In the expansive ""Star Trek"" franchise -- both on the big and small screens -- ""Enterprise"" was the last TV series, coming long after the successes of ""The Next Generation,"" ""Deep Space Nine,"" and ""Voyager.""  It was the first ""Star Trek"" series to be produced and broadcast in high-definition video, but lasted only four seasons.

Though some episodes recapture the magic of earlier series, there are a number of drawn-out, talky shows that are better geared for radio than television, since they lack strong visuals.  Perhaps this has to do with a limited budget, but it's sad to see such a glorious, highly popular franchise diminished by pedestrian writing and lackluster acting.

Bonus features on the six-disc Blu-ray release include a new three-part documentary containing new cast and crew interviews and vintage behind-the-scenes footage; cast and crew commentaries on select episodes; and ""In Conversation,"" a candid interview with creators Rick Berman and Branon Braga.",1365552000,,1608,5.221789883268483

The first time I watched Enterprise (a couple of years after it had originally aired) I went in with very low expectations.

I was very surprised how well done the show was overall, from the cast to production values, etc.

Of course there were the odds and ends that I personally didn't care for but overall I found Enterprise to be the best Trek series overall.

This Star Trek series had a somewhat different feel from its predecessors, jumping back 100 years from the first series instead of the bright new future. And for once, the Vulcans are looked at in a negative way - as a people who hindered humanity's progress. The characters are a bit jaded, yet still embrace the spirit of exploration. This first season may be my favorite of this series. The stories are fresh. And the cast is new and just exploring their characters. While the show had its flaws, especially in its final seasons, I really enjoyed re-watching this first season of Enterprise since its recent move to blu-ray.  And this new set is packed full of special features - commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a 3-part documentary. I'm a huge Star Trek fan, so I jumped at the chance to add this latest series to my blu-ray collection.

Granted, at the time I was very busy so it was very easy for me not to give it much of a chance. A year ago I watched it for the first time beyond the first 3 or 4 episodes. I must say I enjoyed it and was sorry it didn't run as long as the other ST series. One thing I hated, at the time it first aired, was the intro song. All the other ST shows had full orchestrated music that was fitting to the grand nature of the concept and shows. Now, years later, I can appreciate it as a transitional phase. In the ST universe, ""we"" were emerging into the galaxy as explorers. If you think about it, people weren't so different in Enterprise as they are now. They had not fully evolved as they had in the other shows which were hundreds of years later. Now, I think this series shows a kind of segue from our current rather primitive state of being (wars, greed & power struggles we currently endure) to the next step of cowboy Kirk and beyond to the enlightened era of STNG and beyond. The characters are fun and seriously, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because, try as I might, I really had problems with this Angelina Jolie Vulcan. Wasn't crazy about the weapons guy either but the rest of the cast made for some interesting stories.

2243750,4,B0007TKH66,"I am bringing this review over from the DVDs.  It still holds true!

This is a long time coming, and I know there is already a ton of reviews for this series. I just have to give my take on this series just too kind of cleanse my soul after watching it for the second time.

Broken Bow was the start of the series, and it had a lot of promise and it gave me so much hope for the show. Who wouldn't want to see the missions before the Original Trek Crew of Kirk and Spock? In this episode we see the Klingons for the first time in the Trek universe and to any fan of Star Trek you immediately notice something that most casual fans might not. So it starts to make you think about the possibilities of what could have happened. It was a great time to be a Trek fan.

Season One started out strong and for the most part was a great first step in building the Trek universe, That said Season two was dragged down by time travel, too much was used to try and explain things. It was unnecessary and a cheap way to explain things. In my opinion it brought the show down and ruined what could have been an outstanding show. The second season turns Enterprise into an acceptable TV drama that was to busy trying to confuse everyone.

Season two brought more time travel into the mix with trying to expand the ""Temporal Cold War"". Season one had the ""Temporal Cold War"" and if you didn't get it by the end of season one, season two and three throw it in your face every time they can. It really cheapens the Trek universe and it reveals too much to Captain Archer. Even with all the future information given to him you wonder why he makes some of the decisions he makes knowing full well what would happen if he just did it another way. With the information given to Captain Archer about the Federation being formed you feel as if it deprives you and him of the experience of creating it. There was no need for time travel in this show. Season two was were a lot of the fans left the show on to better things.

If Season two was not enough to make you turn it off, Season three was another good reason to do so. As with season two and one the ""Temporal Cold War"" plays a big role with the Xindi learning of how Earth is going to destroy their home world from another faction of the Cold War feeding the Xindi lies. This in an attempt to destroy humans so the other species manipulating the Xindi could eventually take over the known universe. So you guessed it, more time travel and more nonsense. The Season starts off with the Xindi sending a massive weapon of mass destruction to Earth which ends up killing 7 million people. So humans and Enterprise has to go to ""The Expanse"" to find the Xindi and stop them from completing an even bigger weapon that would destroy Earth in one blow. This Season also tries to strengthen a romance that you feel was developing slightly in the First and Second seasons. The season ends with Enterprise being thrown back into time. Once again you're left wondering if they will just let the ""Cold War"" die and get back to being Star Trek!!

If you managed to stick with the show you're finally made it to the best part of what unfortunately became the last season of this show. It started out weak with the whole time travel thing, but they finally stopped the nonsense with time travel and focused on what was important. It got the series back on track, and featured more of the aliens we have come to know. The first part started off with the Augments and even has a reference to the ""Botany Bay"" and ""KHAN""! The show also started to explain the Klingon disease that changed their appearance to what we saw in the Original Show with Kirk. This Fourth season was what we craved the show to be from the start and it was delivering on so many levels only to destroy you in the finial episode.

The last episode is what makes people cringe with fear when they watch this show. They know what's coming. I for one hated the last episode as it basically makes you feel the whole experience was a joke from the start. Was it real or all fake? The little joke they had going though the whole series about a chief which you never see until now makes you wonder was it all worth it. The last episode cheapens what the whole cast had worked for and basically turned it into a half baked Star Trek ""The Next Generation"" episode.

A few things could have been changed and this episode would have been great! Change one would be get rid of the TNG cast and all references to TNG. Let it be about Enterprise and not William Riker! Don't kill off an awesome character that everyone agrees is one of the best in the show for no reason. This was done just to make fans talk, and it was senseless, there was no point in the killing and it seemed so forced like it was a joke to the writers. Lastly show the speech we all wanted to see. Why was this never shown? It was start of the federation, the speech that made it comes into being and nothing was shown. If you took out all the worthless TNG crap they would have had plenty of time to show the speech. Besides that it was an ok episode and I understood what they were trying to do, but it failed miserably. ( I really believe if you just take out the one death, everyone would be happy with this episode, it would not make it so hated like it is. Still a bad episode but that one death thows it over the top of being bad).

Besides the last episode and the clunky 2nd and 3rd season, this is a great show. The fourth season really does hit a home run, and it's too bad they canceled it. I hope they could do something in the future with Star Trek. It's like something has been missing for so long from TV and it needs to come back in the ""Original Time Line"". Maybe the first episode should try and fix the damage done to Enterprise with another holodeck recreation of the 'Real Events"". Having said how badly this show ends, I would still recommend this show to Trek Fans. It's a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.

Update:

I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy. I never really owned the real DVD set so(I bought my DVD's in Afghanistan, so what I really have is a Ripped version of the show. :-), I thought it was about time I buy the show in a proper format.

First, I would like everyone to understand the reason why the first season of ""Enterprise"" is not up to picture quality like ""The Original Star Trek"" or ""The Next Generation"". This is not a remaster of ""Enterprise"". This is simply a transfer of the original film to blu-ray disk. I am not the only one to realize this, Blu-Ray.com does not really talk about this, but another review does. Read the Digitalbits review it's very spot on!!

The picture is an upgrade over the DVD's, but its not a huge upgrade. If you are like me and have not bought the DVDs yet, than this is the set you want. You will not be disappointed in the quality. The first episode was the worse picture out the whole season, but it did get better along the way. I believe this is due to the fact that the show was filmed when HD was still very young. On the plus side it's the first Star Trek filmed in Widescreen.

The sound is not great, but it is 5.1 and it's an upgrade over the DVD's. The best thing about ""Enterprise"" on blu-ray is the special features. Words can not express the amount of extra's you get on this Blu-Ray. The extras alone prove how much love CBS put into this Blu-Ray set. If you think CBS is taking your money for a substandard blu-ray than the Special Features prove you wrong. All of the DVD extras and even the Best Buy Extras are presented here, plus a few new ones that will blow you away on the amount of information given on why the show was not what it could have been.

Overall the score for this release is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. The picture could have been remastered, but I understand the reason why it was not. The picture was state of the art back in 2001 but today it does not hold up. The sound is good but could have been great. Despite the little problems ""Enterprise"" on blu-ray comes warping out of space dock onto your TV in a great package and is a overall great value.",1364428800,13,8181,4.211231652839821
2243751,5,B0007TKH66,"I watched this show more than 10 years ago and although it was good it did not seem great at the time. Watching it in 2013 it just seems much better than it did back at the the start of the 21st century. It has aged well!  Good plots and good acting! The film quality could be a tad sharper though! Too bad Amazon does not have the newly released 1080, p version of the first season.",1364342400,,383,3.9740259740259742
2243752,4,B0007TKH66,"I really wanted to give this product five stars.  Although I didn't like Enterprise until I decided to give it a try again on Netflix last year, I was excited for this release.  You can tell CBS didn't put as much painstaking work into remastering this (as it was already shot in 720) as they did TOS and TNG, and as they will undoubtedly have to do for DS9 and VOY.  Either way, the high definition offered here is still far superior to what you'll find on Netflix, Amazon's streaming service, or even on the original DVDs (even if you have a player that upscales like I do, such as the PS3).  The VAM - value added material newly recorded for the Blu-Rays - didn't excite me as much as TNG's did.  The conversation between Rick Berman and Brannon Braga was certainly interesting, but I felt like they needed a moderator to stay on topic.  I did enjoy the 3-part intro documentary for Enterprise.  Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase, but I'm hoping Season Two packs a bigger punch.",1364342400,3,991,4.472222222222222
2243753,4,B0007TKH66,"Over the next few weeks there is likely to be a lot of online chatter about how this blu-ray release is a disappointment.  Having spent several hours already viewing season 1 of Enterprise on blu-ray, I'm not here to disagree.  It is a disappointment, but only to a certain degree.  When TOS and Next Generation were debuted on blu-ray, everyone was stunned by the improvement in audio and especially the video quality.  That excitement will not likely greet this release, but Enterprise on blu-ray is still a great thing, and I wanted to give what I hope is a balanced view of the good and the not-so-good.

I'll start with the not-so-good:  The video quality on season one is a major disappointment. Ironically, the newest star trek television series is the least compelling in its blu-ray release.  The clarity is not spectacular, the color is rather dull, the dark scenes look particularly muddy.  And that's just  the live action footage.  The CG work was not re-rendered in 1080p, but upscaled from its original 720.  The cheaper approach definitely shows.  There is noticeable artifacting that occurs when you do this, especially when objects like space ships are in motion.  It's not awful, but it's disappointing.

There are a few comforting realities.  The series pilot (Broken Bow) is noticeably worse than the others; it does not represent the overall quality of season one.  Don't watch it and assume all of season one will be as bad.  According to a review on Digital Bits, there is a likely explanation.  When the pilot was being shot, it wasn't yet decided if the series would be broadcast in 4:3 or widescreen.  The decision was then made to broadcast in widescreen, and apparently the pilot had to be reframed for this, which would reduce the resolution.  Having had the chance to compare the video quality with other episodes in season one, this is exactly what it looks like happened.  I can't confirm this, but it would explain why the pilot looks especially bad.  The second episode was noticeably improved.  I then decided to jump ahead to the season cliff hanger, and it looks better yet.  For whatever reason, the look of the series seemed to improve over the course of the first season, at least in its first blu-ray release.

As an experiment, I pulled out my dvd edition of season 3 and popped in the first episode.  I was immediately jolted by how horrible it looks!  I had forgotten what an upgrade hi-def, even not stellar hi-def, provides.  And I have a reference quality blu-ray player with good internal upscaling.  So yes, even though this blu-ray could have been better, it's still quite an upgrade from dvd!!

More of the good stuff:  There is a significant improvement in sound quality with the lossless 5.1 audio.  CBS did not choose to give the audio the 7.1 treatment, but it's still very satisfying, with better low-end and clearer dialogue.  The menus are nicely done and the series theme song (which many people hate!) has never sounded better!

And the best of the best is the ton of extras included.  Among those is an hour-long dialogue between Rick Berman and Brannon Braga about the series inception, high points and problems.  It's the most frank discussion they've ever given on the topic.  These two men were vilified by many star trek fans when Enterprise was floundering.  In my opinion, much of the criticism was undeserved, to the point of being hysterical and bizarre at times.  The interview is a good window into these two men, and the struggles of bringing Enterprise to the small screen when interest in Star Trek across the board was waning.

All of the previous special features from the dvd release of Enterprise are carried over, as well as several other new documentaries that are presented in HD.

All in all, I would recommend this blu-ray release to most Star Trek fans.  If you want to buy it only to be dazzled by the new HD presentation, you will be disappointed.  However, don't view the pilot episode and assume the rest will look as bad.  The other episodes are better.  If you are interested in the history behind this series, and a perspective on how it fits into the Star Trek universe, you will have hours of special features to give you such insights.

CBS obviously decided that this series did not have a large enough audience to justify the financial investment that would have been involved in making it look spectacular.  My guess is that season two, and especially 3 and 4 will look at least a little better than season one.  Hopefully CBS will continue to offer fascinating new special features to accompany these coming seasons.",1364342400,10,4616,4.761664564943254
2243754,5,B0007TKH66,"First off I watched Enterprise from start to finish so I was not one who tuned out. Second I thought the casting was great and the writing was excellent (as with any star trek shows there are always a few episodes that are hard to love but there are more than enough that you love outright)I think access was the main problem for most people. I am sure they went to friend's houses so as not to miss the premier but this could not be done every week (I am assuming). Luckily our cable company carried it. The other reason for lack of ratings was the fact that everyone who seemed to be criticising the show never saw the show. they were going by what others had said or what they read from critics. And anyone who is a true fan of science fiction will tell you, Most critics (though not all) have no clue what Star Trek or even Science Fiction is all about. So why listen to them? I have always been the type who read reviews but could filter out useless opinion (for instance they'd have a writer review a show like Star Trek, when they are not even A Sci Fi Fan). But, even if the review was scathing I'd still have to judge it for myself. The only thing as a fan, that I can say may have alienated some people (who do not get the priveledge to watch week to week) is that season 3 was one major story arc. I understand how that can seem a bit tired after awhile, but it was very ambitious and actually well executed, and seeing the borg episode was great as well. My only issue with the series, as I've said the cast/writing/directing were great, is that the final episode made no sense and even included old star trek stars, rather than focusing on the enterprise crew. I do not blame the writers etc for this, as I am under the impression they had little notice that they were being canceled and so they cobbled something together to give the show closure, however it just gave most fans convulsions:). I am glad that this series is getting the blu ray treatment I have bought every star trek blu ray so far, and they have done a great job. and it seems that Star Trek as a whole always does better with video releases than they do with ratings/grosses. And it's nice to see that Paramount isn't taking the easy way out and they are not only in it for the money (obviously any company would be) but they are giving the fans a great presentation of the show on enough discs (no excess compression, everything is spread out to take advantage of the blu ray's size) and they get a plethora of extras. Everything is well produced and done well. Giving Star Trek new life, and perhaps adding a new audience. While JJ Abrams may be giving a breath of fresh air to the franchise, we must remember it's these series that gave it life, Everything Roddenberry dreamed of, every hope, every wishful thought flows from the screen in each episode. Humanity may not be perfect, but when we balance the good and the bad of mankind, ultimately we find the good always outweighs the bad. And that is what Roddenberry wanted to share with us: Hope. And Enterprise does a great job and perpetuating that theme. We may not be the best we can be...but eventually we'll get there. Perhaps going where no one has gone before isn't about the exploration of new species and galaxies but about understanding ourselves and our place in that galaxy. For anyone on  the fence about buying the blu rays, my advice is to buy it now so you won't regret it later:) you won't be disappointed.

I must also add that when TNG came out, everyone was rather negative yet the ratings were high. And there were a lot more rougher episodes to watch than the enterprise has (though I must add seeing tng on blu ray has made it easier to judge the series as the look/feel of the remastered video leaves the only criticism left for the actual writing/acting). Maybe now on Blu ray people can give the crew of the Enterpise a fair shot. I know a lot of people didn't like Bacula for the captain as he was in another iconic sci fi franchise, Quantum Leap and apparently you can't star in two major franchises of the same genre. Bacula makes it work though and the human way in which they all act in the beginning before starfleets regulations were formulated, is an interesting take on space travel. We are not the holier-than-thou space farers intent on protecting the galaxy, we are very human explorers who want to satiate their curiostiy and well stay alive while doing so. And they are in over their heads. Of course they tech of star trek, in going backwards, was hard to come up with, how can you simplify the communicators of TOS when in today's time frame we have smaller more technologically advanced looking cell phones? sure we can dial into space (yet) but the look of the tech now makes TOS look silly. Unless of course you view it for what it is, and now what you want it to be. which seems to be what a lot of negative sci fi fans are doing, they aren't judging the show by what it does, or what it shows, but by what it didnt' show or do that the reviewer was hoping they'd do. That's probably why Lucas sold Lucasfilm he was tired of everyone yelling at him for doing the movies the way he wanted to do them, they belong to him after all. So why not just enjoy the show for what it is rather that what our expectations had hoped they'd be. This really is an excellent series...so anyone who is on the fence I say go for it. You may see it in a different light now that it's on Blu Ray. The extras alone are a huge selling point for this set...and the series is phenomenal.",1364256000,2,5549,4.319271332694152
2243755,5,B0007TKH66,"never really a trekky, until I decided to watch all of them back to back
this series was my favorite by far, it was just too bad there arnt a lot of seasons..",1364256000,4,158,3.8181818181818183
2243756,3,B0007TKH66,"I hate to make my review about just one thing, visual quality, but to me it was the most critical reason to upgrade from DVD to Bluray. I've had Enterprise on DVD ever since it was available, so I knew what I was getting in terms of the quality of the show itself.  I love Star Trek, so I'd feel remiss if I didn't have all of the seasons of all four shows as well as The Animated Series.

I had this on preorder, so I hadn't the chance to read the reviews on sites like The Digital Bits and Bluray.com before I purchased it.  Even then, it's hard not to treat video quality subjectively, which makes it difficult for me to accept a review until I see the video with my own eyes.  With TNG, for example, the differences between the DVD and the Bluray versions were so striking I felt I was seeing the episodes the way they were meant to be seen for the first time.  Although the reviews had indicated this, until I had seen it I would never have believed how remarkable the difference was.

Unfortunately, this Enteprise Bluray simply doesn't measure up to those other efforts.  The remastered TOS and TNG Blurays are vibrant, clear, and sharp.  CBS put in a remarkable effort to restore them, resulting in nearly reference-quality video that's even competitive with modern shows.  Enterprise episodes, in contrast, look soft and washed out, with muted colors and even some noise.  The blacks are flat instead of conveying a sense of deep space. In many ways, I feel like I'm watching an upscaled DVD, with many of the compression problems inherent to the older format.

Perhaps I'm spoiled in this day and age, but when a closeup of an actor's face remains fuzzy, you can barely pick out individual hairs on their head, and their uniform looks dingy when it should look vibrant, I can't help but feel underwhelmed and even disappointed.

As Bluray.com noted, perhaps someday they will be able to go back and give this series the treatment it deserves.  Until then, we have this Bluray which just barely drags itself across the threshold of ""HD.""",1364169600,,2046,4.557377049180328

The first season did fine with the requisite introduction of the characters and beginning to establish their backgrounds. What Enterprise did exceedingly well throughout its run was continuity. Episode to episode, there are small references, and details carried over from previous episodes and seasons. However, the first season struggled to find the balance between action and character development, and is widely regarded by audiences as having a strange pace. Enterprise really hit its stride in the third and fourth seasons as Manny Coto got more involved with producing the show, and Brannon Braga less involved. This season had a lot of Braga, which, in my opinion, caused it to flounder a bit. This season was a valiant effort and a near miss.

I love the time period and the fact Enterprise shows how we go from today to the Federation.

There are probably a number of contributing reasons that Enterprise seemed only average to me but I think the major reason is Scott Bakula playing Captain Archer. I like Scott Bakula but he seems to come up short as a Star Fleet Captain; to me this was by not being able to project enough of a command presence in the vast majority of the series. In a way, it was kind of difficult to take him seriously most of the time.

I didn't realize that you only get thirty days to return it if it's a faulty product.  About six weeks later (after Christmas) she discovered that many episodes would not play.  I bought one for myself and I had the same problem.  Now it was too late to return.  I e-mailed Carmel Beach Books about the problem and they told me to ""send it back.""  That's all they wrote.  No return labels, no promise of money back - nothing!  Amazon wouldn't help me because it was over thirty days. I decided to cut my loses and I bought another from a local store and sent it to her.  I didn't bother to replace mine.  It's too bad because we both love the show and I had planned on buying more for the both of us.  I won't now!

Then Captain Archer betrays the Vulcans, their main alleys, by deliberately giving the Andorians top-secret Vulcan info. If T'pol was really logical, she would have killed all the Andorians as well as her human crewmates on the spot.

The show promised to put a new spin on the franchise.  After watching a few episodes I can see why the show faltered and eventually failed.  Here is what I see

Opening:  Terrible Rock 80's ballet!!  Say Wha- They used a horrible opening song, so bad in fact I could see people turning the channel to wait for it to be over, you never want veiwers to turn the channel.  We are opening to an adventure about the galaxy in all its glory, stick to a classic epic orchestra opening.

Captain Archer:  The very first captain of a StarFleet vessel, a very exciting role, yet they write the character to be nieve, spineless, and really boring.  The writers give him some bold lines and actions every once in a while but a true personality is never pulled off, and you are left with a inept captain.  This is following some great personalities in the ST Universe: Kirk a resourceful from the hip cowboy, Picard an intelligent by the book gentleman, and Janeway who is bold and stubborn yet nurturing.

The show itself: Never really sets itself apart from the rest.  Here is humans first shot at the galaxy in the first ship capable of exploring, but you feel like you are watching just another ST series.  They crew basicly remains faceless, the ship is a cold eviroment that sees to every comfort (yes they call it different things but reprocessed protien is still replicated food) and the main characters are the officers.  I was expecting a rag tag crew of hot heads and volenteers, a group willing to risk space adventures, a ship with personallity (Millenium Falcon, Serenity in Firefly, etc) and ship officers who had the beef to control it all.

There seems to be more suspense and action in this series than I'm used to in Star Trek, but for me it's a welcome addition. As far as first seasons go I can't recall a Star Trek that started out as strong as this series has so far. Take a look at TNG; probably my favorite ST of all, but half of the first season is almost un-watchable....and most ST fans will admit that.

A good episode here: The story makes sense, it's not predictable, and the visual effects are impressive, but not invasive. As I mentioned I'm really starting to enjoy this series, and that's a pretty big deal since I'm usually rather critical.

T'Pol update 2012 *sigh*:
I wanted to give Jolene some episodes before I judge her acting, but my opinion has just gotten worse :\ She's the perfect example of just how hard it is to play a Vulcan. Maybe it's the directors fault, maybe he's telling her to read the lines in a robotic monotone quiet voice...When Compared to Tuvok or Spock you see just how tough it has to be for an actor to BE vulcan, sorry but Jolene fails so hard it takes you out of the moment every time she speaks. Okay; so she's easy on the eyes, but then again so was Seven of Nine, but Jeri Ryan masterfully played that Borg-Human like a damn pro.",1343174400,,1394,4.378378378378378

But...I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did (now I can skip the intro). The special Effects have evolved to a point where they actually enhance the experience, and it makes me wonder how TNG would be if it was made now. It's a small plain cast, but there are some standout characters and I'm loving the idea of the show and the action.

As of now Jolene Blalock is the only disappointing part about the show...her acting as T'Pol is lacking. I want to give her a few episodes before I judge her too harshly (maybe she needs time to learn her character?). But as of now it's almost like watching Data try and impersonate a Robot, definitely shows just how talented Tim Russ (Tuvok) and Leonard Nimoy (Spock) were.

Last summer I watched all but a handful of episodes on the feed from Star Trek.com.  Free yes-- but it had a few episodes missing including one of the highlights of Season One- Dear Doctor.

Also, some of the story lines were interchangeable with other Trek shows, the episode ""Terra Nova"" in particular reminded me of the Voyager episode, ""Friendship One.""

The series is just like Star Wars I.  Yeah, people kinda wanted to see what happened before.  But just like Star Wars I, this series has no soul.  It's not any one particular thing, so-so acting, so-so dialogue, so-so plot.  Can't really blame any one person.  Just the entire thing together.

The doctor is the only ""character"" in this show.  Even his character is muted.  The other characters are basically one big ""blah"".  Everyone is in a dull boring uniform  which could have been changed dramatically considering the time difference.  Heck, since this wasn't really a military vessel, you didn't really need standardized uniforms.  And if it was, no ""marines"" departed with the commander when he left the ship?

In a ""prototype"" ship everything is clean and neat.  The quarters have full amenities which seem like they were designed by 2 full time designers.  Anyone know what happened when the first astronaut had to take a dump?  The writer didn't really need to make the changes I recommended, but they needed to do something to give the ship a soul.

Many writers said that the TV series didn't make it past season 4 because people were tired of Star Trek.  I believe the series didn't make it because it sucked.",1338076800,6,1263,4.7110091743119265

2243832,4,B0007TKH66,"This was a great series and it was a shame that people were not willing to give it more of a chance. Perhaps it was because they were portraying earlier less advanced humans and pre-federation. The only think I think they missed terribly was getting the series stuck into the temporal time line. Eventually it took over the whole series and ruined it. Enterprise series could have been saved had the writers, producers, and directors, gotten back on track of exploration (which should have been more important in Enterprise than in Star Trek: TOS) since we were new to the galaxy. That damn temporal time line became so convoluted even Captains Kirk, Picard, and Janeway could not have saved the timeline that many times (lol). Too bad they didn't get one more season to get back on track with some great stories. And there were some fabulous character stories left unwritten. Certainly enough for 7 seasons. My favorite character was Dr. Flox bar none. I felt Scott Bakula was perfect as the captain of the Enterprise and really think all the casting was great. But there was so much more the writers could have done to develop the characters instead of chasing the temporal time line. I felt the series was abandoned by not just the network but by ""faithful"" Trek Fans and we could have made our voices heard as to the story lines and the direction the series was taking. It is true that the network which picked up the series was not available to many people which hurt the ""almighty Neilson ratings (which to me are a crock and do not accurately reflect a show's popularity)But had trekkies wrote in and voiced concern over the direction of the show, the creative teams would have repsponded. They know the loyal fan base and age group.

My other major issue with Star Trek: Enterprise was that 80's Ballad intro. It just killled the show before you ever gave it a try. They should have killed whomever came up with that. It could have been changed by the second season to a beautiful Star Trek style orchestration and beautiful seniery. I will never understand why they did that. I hate that 80's Ballad Intro so badly that I skip over it every time. I lived the 80's and I didn't watch Star Trek to remind me of it. They totally missed it with the opening. Perhaps one day, they will re-release Star Trek: Enterprise with an appropriate Intro. (Here's a clue......go on YouTube and look at many that were created by non-professionals and pick out any of them and it is better than what we were given.) That 80's Ballad was hideous and did not set the mood to watch a Star Trek series. It was so out of character and I am a trained musician and understand this all too well. Which is probably why it is such a gripe that when they released the DVD's they didn't go ahead and produce and replace the horrible intro.

In closing, this series should have lasted 7 seasons had they corrected where they went awry and not believed the lying Neilson ratings. Unfortunately for all of us lifelong Trekkies (I am 46 and have been watching my whole life every series and every movie). This was probably the very last Trek Series we will ever have and that is a shame. Many if not most of the original writer, producers, directors are gone now. And what we got left with was a Star Trek (2009) Re-boot movie by J.J. Abrams that abandoned everything Star Trek stood for. You could tell it was made for today's teenagers. There was nothing cerebral nor unpredictable in that movie and it was Star Wars set in the Star Trek universe. I was devastated at the horrible movie and what they called a re-boot was just the destruction of Gene Roddenberry's ideas. I will say it took me a long time to warm up to DS9 as it was far from my favorite series however, in hindsight it was fabulous but just in such a different way. And Star Trek needed the shakeup of the story line.

LONG LIVE THE TRUE TREK IDEAS WHICH I BELIEVE ALL THE SERIES EMBODIED AND ALL THE MOVIES EXCEPT.............................""STAR TREK....THE RE-BOOT"" which was a total failure and I will never go watch another ""new Star Trek"" until they return to the original concept. Again Star Trek Re-boot was nothing but special effects and fighting sequences displayed for adolescent teens and pre-teens. Not true Star Trek Fans. I would have given that movie a zero rating if they would let me.",1332633600,2,4350,4.574358974358974
2243833,5,B0007TKH66,I have to say that I enjoyed Enterprise almost as much as The Next Generation.

2243835,4,B0007TKH66,"I am a Star Trek geek.  Not a costume wearing one, I just enjoy Sci-Fi and I would rather watch this season one set than watch what is on TV today.  Overall I thought this was a good start to the series and I enjoyed most of the episodes on the disks.

I thought the characters in the series were played well by the actors but I felt the actor who played Reed was neither the best choice nor the best acting job for the role.  I found him annoying in his defeatist demeanor and whining.  (Shuttlepod One for example)

There are several storyline issues but to me the most glaring were the Temporal Cold War and the race called the Suliban.  I found it odd that the writers introduced two totally new aspects to the Star Trek saga that had never been mentioned in all of the past shows.  Wouldn't all of the other shows have brought up a past race of aliens, especially one that tried to destroy the Federation almost before it ever got started?

Nevertheless I still enjoyed the episodes and had a lot of fun just watching anything related to Star Trek that was good.  I won't review each episode as so many people have done it and it would just be repetitious to do so.  I felt that overall there were more good episodes that average ones and there was only one I didn't care for. (Fusion)

I did like the story line regarding the resentment of humans toward Vulcans for holding back their efforts in space travel and constantly telling them that we were not mature enough to explore the galaxy.  The resentment level made the series more interesting as the crew strived even harder to stand on their own and be successful.

2243840,4,B0007TKH66,"Well, way back in the 60's there was a show called ""Star Trek"".  I was a kid and it had a great affect on me in a lot of ways.  It did on many others as well too.  Movies, cartoons, books sprouted up after the show was abruptly cancelled ... probably for being too subversive.  The original series is still pretty good, if it is a little dated and simple.  Originally it was billed as an adult science fiction drama if I recall right.

Well, my affection for Star Trek had me going to movies and eventually watching spin-off series, one after the other, until I just lost interest.  Most of the Next Generation shows were too staid and politically correct for me, but mostly they were dry and preachy and kind of campy even.  There was one excellent episode I think was entitled ""The Flute"" that I thought was very good.  But I lost interest and stopped caring after a while.  Then came ""Deep Space Nine"", ""Voyager"", and finally ""Enterprise"".  By the time ""Enterprise"" came along I considered it kid stuff.  When the ""Star Trek"" movie reboot showed up it was great eye candy, but it just made me mad it was so far from the original vision of Gene Roddenberry.

Well ... thank to streaming video NetFlix and Amazon I have had the chance without a major investment in time and money to sample ""Enterprise"".  The first episodes of the first season were pretty much what I expected and more or less the same predictable formula of the franchise.  But a funny thing happened over time as I watched the episodes develop, the show got into a pace, and it was more raw, more honest, less politically correct, less preachy, and by the second season - damn good.

The first season is good, but I almost did not keep up watching it.  Something happened in the second season, particularly with the episode ""Cogenitor"" that showed me the series had writers that were not afraid to dive into tough issues, with good writing and with class.

""Enterprise"" is excellent.  Certainly it will never have the same effect on me that the original series had as a kid, but I think it is better than the original series, though not quite as comedic, it meets the criterion of an adult science fiction drama.  It's really good, and congratulations to the actors, effects makers, writers and directors for doing a f-ing excellent job of bringing Star Trek back to life.  The whole cast is great and the stories are much fun yet the stories as serious and human but still do not take themselves too seriously.  Just a wonderful experience to se this ... and my only regret is that I did not give it a chance and add to ""Enterprise's"" ratings when it was on.  This show has every indication that it had plenty of adventures to go and a lot of good ideas and thought provoking statements.

As I approach the finishing of the 4th season I find myself sorry that it is coming to an end and wanting more.  I would not jump at the chance to see another Star Trek series franchise if it was anywhere as good as ""Enterprise"".

The premise is good, but the execution is horrid. The ""beginning of the federation"" drew me in, I was curious to find out about: the ""prime directive"" and ""first contact"" and the development of the various techs, but they just glanced over it as little tidbits or parts of dialogue in various episodes scattered througout. I believe that a more in depth view or analyses would have been better.

I think this show failed miserably for a reason, I only watched the first two seasons ( I read synopsis of the last two) and I can say that I have been hugely dissappointed.

(Released: 2005 by Paramount Home Entertainment)
Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

In the beginning, Zefram Cochrine invented Warp Drive technology.  The rest was (TV, movie, and merchandising) history!

Somehow, I'd never seen STAR TREK ENTERPRISE before.  That is until an Amazon.com DVD sale proved irresistible, and I finally took the plunge.

I didn't know what to expect.  What I did know is that, while I loved both STAR TREK THE ORIGINAL SERIES (""TOS"") and STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION (""TNG""- Great shows for different reasons!), each succeeding TREK series left me less and less satisfied.

I liked DEEP SPACE NINE (""DS9"") less than TNG, and VOYAGER (""VOY"") less than DS9.  As VOYAGER was winding down, ENTERPRISE (""ENT"") was starting up.  Life's ups and downs notwithstanding, I was also not too eager to sample yet another TREK show that would presumably continue the downward trend.

Elaborating on why I felt this way toward DS9 and VOY, I can only say that each moved further away from the ""core"" of what I thought STAR TREK should be.

Both series were not about a ship (Extra points if the ship is named ""Enterprise""!) in active service to the Federation.  Yes, Voyager was a ship too, but it was (um...) ""lost in space"", full of weird characters, and wasn't nearly as much fun as was the Jupiter II.

There were also too many strange aliens on these shows.  In contrast, TOS and TNG were far more relatable to us humans.  Vulcans, Klingons, and the occasional Betazoid are okay, but I really started drawing the line at regularly featured Ferengi (DS9 - I HATE Ferengi!) and the very annoying Neelix (VOY).

ENTERPRISE goes back to the beginning and, much as J.J. Abrams has done in his recent feature film, starts to tell the story from the ground (Earth's ""ground"") on up.

Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer, is the perfect middle-ground between ""womanizer/ cowboy"" James T. Kirk and ""stiff-upper-lipped"" Jean Luc Picard.

The crew he leads is predominantly human (Engineer Trip Tucker, Armory Officer Malcolm Reed, Navigator Travis Mayweather, and Translator Hoshi Sato), with just the right number of aliens... Vulcan Science Officer Sub-Commander T'Pol and genial Doctor Phlox (a Denobulan who is part of the ""Inter-Species-Medical-Exchange"").

As this series took place a century before the original STAR TREK, efforts were made to look... not merely retro, but ""pre-retro"", if you will.  This Enterprise is small, almost cramped, compared with later models.  Try as they might, the set design crew couldn't always make this 2001 show look 100 years more primitive than its 1966 predecessor.

The clothing had to step back as well.  Starfleet Admirals wore basic (but somewhat futuristically designed) military dress uniforms - and Archer and his crew wore garb that was a cross between NASA gear and the crew jumpsuits from VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.

Oh, and Archer has a DOG!  A beagle named ""Porthos"".  A first for a TREK series!

As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Packaging: Why is it that ALL STAR TREK SERIES have packaging that is both annoying and difficult to open and negotiate?!  The discs of STAR TREK ENTERPRISE are housed in a large ""clamshell"" pack that opens like an oversized stick of deodorant!

Attached to the package with TWO DABS OF GLUE is a cardboard piece that wraps AROUND THE TOP FRONT, BACK, AND BOTTOM FRONT of the package!  You cannot open the package without removing the cardboard.  BUT, on this cardboard, is the ONLY PLACE that it is identified as being the FIRST SEASON!  So, if you remove it, nothing else on the package can distinguish it from subsequent seasons.  WHY?

Menu Navigation: STAR TREK SERIES often have the most difficult, and outright noisy Menus to navigate.  Though, I must admit that the menus of ENTERPRISE are much easier to navigate than that of the Original Series. Still, it is a CON.

No Skipping the End Credits:  To my surprise, I found that the EPISODE END CREDITS - the SAME end credits that Paramount routinely shrunk, squashed, and did not allow to be read in its original UPN TV broadcasts - COULD NOT BE CHAPTER-SKIPPED on it's DVDs.  Of course, I can choose to fast forward through them, if need be.  BUT... Just thought I'd share the irony, folks!

The PROS:

Wide Screen:  STAR TREK ENTERPRISE is the first TREK series to be filmed in wide-screen.  When played on my HD TV and upconverted via Blu-ray player, it's a delight to behold!

The Episodes - with a special emphasis on the pilot:

""Broken Bow"":  No Star Dates here!  This takes place in the almost-relatable year 2151!
It has been 90-100 years since Cochrine's introduction of Warp Drive and travel to the distant stars is now a more a reality than a possibility.

The planet Vulcan has taken notice of these early experiments, and has sent emissaries to Earth... to ""guide us"" along the correct path.  This is a SUPERB inversion of all those TOS and TNG episodes where the Federation declines or refuses to share its superior technologies with developing planetary cultures, due to the ""Prime Directive"".

Resentment toward our Vulcan ""friends"" has grown, as they are suspect of holding back on technological developments and suppressing the development of Earth's Warp Program efforts.

Jonathan Archer, the son of Henry Archer - an associate of Cochrine's - is selected to be captain of the just completed ""Enterprise NX-01"", a forerunner of the more familiar later USS Enterprise NCC-1701.  The Enterprise NX-01 can reach the as-of-yet unheard of speed of Warp Factor 5!  Later ships could travel at Warp 9 and above.

Without spoiling too much for those who STILL haven't seen it, we have such grand moments as:

The great speech about ""boldly going, etc."" that all starship captains seem to spout was actually from an historic speech by Zefram Cochrine.  The speech is played on the occasion of the launch of the Enterprise NX-01.

The first human to go through a transporter. Under duress, I might add.  It was originally, not thought of for human use.  Shuttle-Pods are routinely used for transport.

The introduction of the ""phase-pistol"" (with two settings ""Stun"" and ""Kill"" - nothing in between).

No Deflector Shields yet.  Instead, they ""polarize the hull plating"".

No phaser-weaponry that can be fired by the ship.  There are ""photon torpedoes"", but they are exactly that - torpedoes that are physically loaded as on a submarine!  ""Phase Cannons"" (the forerunner of ship phaser-weaponry) are developed during Season One.

Communicators are of the good old ""flip variety"".

The initial mission involves a Klingon that was pursued to Earth by hostiles unknown, and the sensitive diplomatic mission to return him to the Klingon homeworld.  Klingons were an unknown species at the time - the one was even referred to as a ""Kling-got"" by the admiral in charge.

We also meet the series' new major villains: The Suliban.  This race is conducting a campaign of aggression against the Klingons and other species, taking its marching orders from a mysterious presence from ""The Future"".  This campaign, referred to as the ""Temporal Cold War"" slowly unfolds over the course of the season - and beyond.

Some pilot, eh?  Now, a few other highlights...

""The Andorian Incident"": Archer and crew stumble onto the ongoing hostilities between the Vulcans and the blue-skinned, antenna-ed Andorians, with unexpected revelations.  Perhaps my favorite episode of this season.

""Cold Front"" Archer is surprised to find his steward hails from 900 years in the future, and is a player in the ""Temporal Cold War"".

""Dear Doctor"":  A grim choice on the part of Archer and Doctor Phlox results in the first contemplations of ""The Prime Directive"" of non-interference with alien cultures.

""Sleeping Dogs"" Archer and company assist the crew of a doomed Klingon ship.  They don't want the assistance.

""Shuttlepod One"":  Trip and Malcolm's ordeal marooned aboard a lost shuttlepod.

""Acquisition"": A boarding party of Ferengi incapacitates the crew of NX-01, and begins to loot the ship. ENTERPRISE does the impossible. A Ferengi story that I actually like!

""Detained"": A militaristic society imprisons Archer and Travis in a detention camp filled with Suliban victims.

""Vox Sola"": A web-like creature invades the Enterprise, takes over a cargo hold, and wraps its captured victims as would a spider!  The images of Archer and his fellow captives webbed-up are effectively disgusting.  A visual masterpiece!

""Desert Crossing"": More striking scenic visuals, as a seemingly friendly desert warlord takes Archer and Trip hostage to obtain knowledge of his enemies.  Clancy Brown (""Superman the Animated Series"", ""Lost"") is a standout as the warlord.

""Shockwave"": Ah, what would a modern STAR TREK series be without a season-ending cliffhanger episode!  This one reveals tantalizingly more about the ""Temporal Cold War"" and the devastating consequences for the Earth when Archer is removed from the time stream.

Extra Features:

Numerous features on the genesis and background of the series are included.  Scott Bakula appears in a featurette to introduce the series. Bakula is also profiled as Captain Archer.  There are also cast impressions of the season and outtakes.

There is an audio commentary track for the pilot, ""Broken Bow"", with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and two additional pop-up ""text commentaries"" by production staffers Michael and Denise Okuda.

My favorite feature is: ""Star Trek Time Travel: Temporal Cold Wars and Beyond"".  The ""Temporal Cold War"" of ENTERPRISE is examined, along with all other notable instances of time travel that occurred in the various TREK series and films.

Overall:

I'm sorry I missed STAR TREK ENTERPRISE in its original 2001-2005 run. From this first season - and what I've seen of the second season thus far - it is severely underrated, likely from its having come along at a time when the mass audience (myself included) was suffering a prolonged case of ""Trek Fatigue"".

If you are so inclined, give it a chance.  You won't be sorry!",1283817600,4,10165,5.020945541591861
2243855,5,B0007TKH66,"For the past 3 years, HD Net has been showing Enterprise in full HD and it is GORGEOUS in HD. Unfortunately, as of yesterday, HD Net is no longer going to show Enterprise (their customer support said their license to play it ran out and they will not renew). I suppose it had to happen after continuously cycling through the 4 seasons repeatedly. However, this is the one Star Trek than I can watch over and over again.

Sci-fi is showing it but not in HD. I suppose I will have to resort to that. I refuse to buy the DVD version, holding out for the Blu Ray. What's the hold up?? As previously stated by others, this one would be so EASY. No re-mastering required, it was filmed in HD for gawd's sake!

2243856,5,B0007TKH66,"I do like this first season effort of Enterprise. Scott Bakula was the only reason I bothered to watch.  It's too bad that there was nothing to connect the casual viewer to the series.  This one had the mistake of being too concerned with Trek lore.  They took the blue and grey colors of Star Trek: The Motion Picture and used them in every aspect of the sets.  The show, unlike the former ones, was very unattractive to the eye.  While I did like the quality of the writing, the sets were not nice to look at.  It was like the crew was in a submarine each week. The stories were recyled from every other Trek show since NG.

If not for Scott Bakula, I do not think I would have purchased this set.  What I would like to know is why he didn't have any story input into his character?  The fourth season under Manny Coto could have saved this show. We'll never get to see season's 5,6 or 7.  I believe Judith and Garfield Reeves Stevens term as story editors could have continued the series,with better stories.  It's too bad Paramount decided to cancel.

The show was the latest to air on television, combined with the fact it is already in widescreen (1.78:1 ratio).  Since the entire Original Series is out on Blu-Ray, logically the next series to be released on Blu-Ray would be ""The Next Generation"", however I wouldn't be surprised if this series is released on Blu-Ray before The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, or Voyager, due to the fact that those 3 series would need more clean-up and re-mastering.",1266019200,12,594,4.803921568627451

2243861,5,B0007TKH66,"Enterprise is great in terms of genuine science fiction.  By that I mean that the first 2 and 4rth seasons are committed to novelty, genuinely new ideas about what if.  This is in contrast to the pure-militarism science fiction, which isn't really clever, just explosions.

Moreover, the history of the Federation is told; if you are a trekkie, then you will want to know this series to know how Vulcans changed to become what we know them in TOS, how and why the Romulans always assailed the Klingon/Federation alliance in TNG, who is in the Federation and why, where did all of the technologies come from...and perhaps most importantly, it's fascinating to look at a time when there is no big tough Federation to defend Earth.  Earth is a minor player, low tech...ironically, it's the Vulcans who are the tough, rough guys who get things done!

I consider it the 2nd best Star Trek.",1258848000,3,884,4.714285714285714
2243862,1,B0007TKH66,"I've always been a fan of Star Trek, from the original series, but I thought Enterprise was just awful. I think it started with the guy they chose for the captain. He is not a good actor and to the extent he has any talent its much better suited to comedy than action adventure. The rest of the cast was also mediocre. Most of the stories just made me grown they had so many holes in the plot or were so contrived and predictable.",1254182400,5,430,4.130952380952381
2243863,4,B0007TKH66,"Combining a grittier, more dangerous period of space exploration with the usual ""Trek"" optimism, the first season of ""Enterprise"" delivers an entertaining array of often-ambitious stories, likable characters, and generous special effects.  On that last point, the show doesn't cheap out when characters have to take a shuttle down to a planet (which happens almost every episode in the show's ""transporters only used as a last resort"" era) and we get to see many nicely done sequences of the crew heading to and returning from their planetside adventures.  A small point to be sure, but the detail was appreciated.

More importantly, the main crew members and their interactions are entertaining and fun, again mixing unpredictability (even Vulcan science officer T'Pol often acts in ways one wouldn't expect, based on our previous experience of the stoic Vulcan race) with the expected loyalty and cameraderie we're used to seeing among previous ""Trek"" crewmen.  Also adding to the unpredictable nature of the show is the fact that the famed ""Prime Directive"" doesn't yet exist, so solutions to delicate problems are quite varied and freewheeling.

Season one of ""Enterprise"" looks and sounds great on standard DVD and there are a variety of interesting extra features, along with some commentaries.  Be warned, though: A pretty good cliffhanger, capping a solid closing episode, will likely have you ordering season two as soon as you complete this set.",1252368000,,1455,5.2770562770562774
2243864,5,B0007TKH66,"Item got to me in the promised condition and speedy delivery.

2243865,4,B0007TKH66,"It is the mid 22nd Century: over a hundred years before Kirk and Spock. The crew of Earth's latest breakthrough Warp 5 starship; led by Captain Jonathan Archer, are making their first steps into the galaxy. Firmly believing humankind has been held back for too long by Vulcan interference, Archer is eager to embark on Enterprise's mission of deep space exploration. Survival proves perilous the farther from home they travel. Outmatched by superior aliens equipped with far more powerful weaponary, this first crew face a steep learning curve. Among their challenges will come Klingon aggression, militaristic Andorians and the Suliban; a race receiving aid from the future.

Those whose discovered Star Trek through JJ Abrams' 2009 movie and are currently awaiting the 2013 sequel - Star Trek Into Darkness, will probably appreciate Enterprise's uncomplicated ""stripped back"" technology style the most. It pitches all the familiar trek-nology seen in the other Star Trek TV series and films at a less advanced stage, trying for something less routine and far-future fantastical. Much of the crew are too scared to use the transporter, a device mostly called upon to beam equipment and supplies around. Instead space suits are regularly seen, together with having to step through complicated airlocks and time spent in decompression and decontamination. Phase pistols are the defensive side arm of choice. Although with projected energy weapons having only recently replaced pulse, blaster-style ones, they're still as Starfleet experimental as the Enterprise NX-01 starship itself. Instead of invisible shields that encompass whole starships like a bubble, protection from alien attack comes down to polarising the hull plating. Instead of tractor beams, capturing another ship requires a grappler deployed from bomb bay doors on the underside, through which small shuttlepods are regularly launched. When you're at a disadvantage, you have nothing but your wits to rely on and this show was about as far from the 24th Century's technobabble saves the day approach as it was possible for Trek to realistically get.

One of the aspects that sets Enterprise apart from Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, is the more down-to-earth characterisation of its crew and often a ""first time"" naivety when faced with a perilous universe. They're imperfect and largely unprepared for a galaxy full of alien lifeforms, extraordinary circumstances, stumbling and making misteps along the way - often with best of intentions. Captain Archer, interested me from the outset (being a fan of Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap) his Captain out there alone with no support, no rulebook or role models to learn from their mistakes. He's a man with a strong prejudice about the Vulcans. While that and some questionable decisions often bring him dangerously close to unlikeable, we get plenty of examples throughout the series that Star Trek's most famous pointy-eared race also still have someway to go, in order to evolve into the likeable kind typified by Spock and Tuvok. Better aspects to Archer's personality are brought out by Shran, a blue-skinned Andorian who appears semi-regularly throughout the 4 years and twice during Season One. Both are deeply skeptical of the Vulcans and yet altogether, they will ultimately end up forging an interstellar alliance known as the Federation.

Other notable crew members include Trip, a likable Southern Engineer who's long friendship with his Captain, somehow manages to survive his occasional bouts of insubordination. T'Pol, initially an observer from a Vulcan government concerned about the impact of humankind's deep exploration, serves as the Enterprise's Vulcan Science Officer and gradually grows more accustomed to an almost entirely human crew and their different perspective. Also helpful is the ship's eternally optimistic alien Doctor, Phlox. He's a Denobulan, who often treats the crew with some very unusual medicine including the leech-like, osmotic eel! In charge of defending the ship, is an explosives obsessed, British armoury officer named Malcolm Reed. Hoshi Sato deftly handles alien languages, in her role as the ship's Communications Officer. Finally space boomer Travis Mayweather is the navigator, one of few humans born in space to a family who run a cargo ship.

Like the Original Series in the 1960s, Enterprise came to a premature end when it was cancelled in 2005 after only 4 seasons. Unlike previous series The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, this show wasn't widely syndicated beyond the now defunct network TV station, UPN. A revealing brand-new 3 part retrospective documentary promises to delve deep into Enterprise's misfortunes. What it was like making Star Trek after a decade and a half uninterrupted run... and how the show wasn't entirely the prequel its producers wanted to make. How they had to deal with Network Executives for the first time, who hampered creative decisions with what they required a Star Trek series to include. Even given those flaws, I ultimately enjoyed much of this show while it lasted... particularly Season 4. I still believe there is unfulfilled potential left in Enterprise and it holds a unique place - as a prequel to both the old franchise and JJ Abrams' motion pictures. After many years without brand new Star Trek adventures beaming across our television screens (where it belongs)... there's perhaps no better time to reappraise this in High Definition. See both where it all began and ironically, how it all ended. Judge for yourself.

2243866,5,B0007TKH66,I love the Enterprise series. Just sad I had to wait till the DVDs want on sale to buy one. Yes I still plan to buy the other seasons. I have watched each disc 2 or 3 times since it arrived at my house!! I LOVE THE THEME SONG!!,1244764800,,227,3.6530612244897958
2243867,4,B0007TKH66,"To my disappointment as a fan of Star Trek since the 60's television series and as a 30 years plus expat the Enterprise series was not picked up by overseas and international television broadcasters I could view as were the original series, STNG, Voyager and Deep Space Nine (being re-run, re-run and re-run). So I was very happy when I stumbled on a set of the second season of Enterprise in a local DVD outlet. Although I am old and jaded I enjoyed the set so turned to Amazon to order more. I thought I would start with the first season and am glad I did. The first season lacks the sophistication of the second season but episodes like ""Acquisition"" have been enjoyable watches nevertheless. My only disappointment is not with this series but with the outrageous price increase in the product since April when I ordered the first season. Prices have been hiked from US$37.49 for each season to US$56.99 for the 3rd season and US$44.99. Ouch! Why? Gouge? Not a smart marketing strategy to increase prices over 50% in a shrinking global economy.",1243555200,,1047,4.664864864864865
2243868,2,B0007TKH66,"Summary:
Awesome cast, great atmosphere, but the quality of the stories varies from the best
that science fiction has to offer to the most boring imaginable.

Main review
The concept of a series taking place shortly after the First Contact Movie is a brilliant idea. But it seems a long way from the idea to realisation. Already at the end of the pilot (Broken Bow) I missed the greatness this concept potentially has. You get thrown into ""business as usually"" (rescuing, exploring etc.) way too soon. I would have loved a pilot movie plus some more shows describing the time from first contact to the launch of Enterprise. That would have been something truly new. But this pilot is just an extended version of a 08/15-show.

The cast delivers frequently - Scott Bakula is on hell of as sovereign captain, Jolene Blalock is sexy as she is intelligent and plays T'Pol with a huge amount of depth. I could continue endlessly with Phlox, Hoshi, Trip, Malcolm...  It's an outstanding team with no need to fear comparison with a Picard, Spock, Scotty...
The set designers and the costume designers all did a great job (thanks for avoiding more romper suits).

But it is difficult when there are too many boring scripts.
Especially in the first two seasons contain too many shows following the pattern:
""Landing on an alien world, been taken prisoner, making an escape."" Even the visit to Risa follows this.
Also there is ""being boarded, been held hostage, chasing away the enemy"".
Then there are some episodes like ""Shuttle pod one"". The whole show consists of a rather dry talk between Malcolm and Trip. I can't imagine something more boring.
And a lot of the shows contain just a recycled script from ""Next Generation"", ""Deep Space 9"" and ""Voyager"", such as ""Terra Nova"", ""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Dawn""...

But on the other hand you can't skip those episode - they sometimes contain important information on the characters. Therefore the waiting for the good and outstanding episodes is somewhat painful. These are the shows ""The Andorian Incident"" (I love the duplicity of the Andorians and there development into the 4th season) , ""Shockwave"", ""First Flight"" and the continuing plot about the Xindi (finally a few more star battles than in TOS, TNG and DS9).

Then when the series was already near its death the 4th season hit with power. The plot about the Augments could have been an Oscar-winning movie, and so would have been the story about the Vulcan's not been that perfect after all. The Andorians continue to deliver and the racial conflict with ""Terra Prime"" is the kind of stuff I waited 4 seasons for.

Conclusion
Seeing the 4th season there is defiantly potential for three more seasons.
But with the experiences of the first two seasons I can't blame the network for discontinuing the show.

I bought the slime line boxes and paid for each 13 British Pounds (18 US-Dollar). If I had paid the regular price for the first editions (80 Dollar) I would have been very upset.",1236988800,5,2977,4.812133072407045
2243869,4,B0007TKH66,"Star Trek Enterprise is a decent show, one I would recommend to anyone who is interested in space sci-fi.  The show deals more with exploration and discovery than any other star trek show before it.  This is due mainly to the fact that this is the first ship to be able to explore.  The pilot is a great episode that does a great job showing how ignorant humans can be in new cultures.  The acting is strong, if not a little over-acted at times, mostly by the guy who plays Mayweather, even Scott Bakula can overact a bit, but this is rare.  Jolene Blalock plays a great science officer and her facial responses to some of the crews actions are classic.  Although she sometimes tries to act so emotionless that she almost seems high.
The doctor and engineer provide some great comic relief as well as being very strong characters.  The tactical officer I could care less about, he's not really that interesting and needs a strong character around him to really shine (usually the chief engineer).  The chemistry between Tucker, T'Pol, and Archer is solid and it is really easy to believe that they have distinct relationships with each other. Archer and T'Pol have probably the most entertaining relationship, they are always at odds over Vulcan logic and Human emotion, yet there characters have a tremendous respect and appreciation for one another.
Overall a very good show for sci-fi fans, although it does have its moments of predictablity and gags that you can see a mile away.  Sometimes these gags are stupid, sometimes funny, and sometimes memorable.
I remember in one of the earlier episodes where they are all camping on the first class M planet they find while Mayweather is telling Ghost Stories.  Situations where the Human Condition can really shine is paramount to this series and I think that it accomplishes that very well.",1234051200,,1841,4.779179810725552
2243870,5,B0007TKH66,"Even better the second time around. We must have missed some of the episodes since some are unfamiliar (or failing memory), this time we are watching it with a surround receiver, a bluray player and a 52"" LCD and there is no comparison to local broadcast (with occasional bad reception) and viewed on a standard def 27"" TV. The filming was obviously done well and the newer equipment is able to show that. I am enjoying the story at least as much as the first time so we've ordered the second season.",1231200000,,500,4.445652173913044
2243871,1,B0007TKH66,"Don't waste your money on Enterprise. It's boring, unoriginal, poorly acted, poorly written, and just a disaster from start to finish. Sadly, this Trek is dreck.",1225411200,5,161,5.230769230769231
2243872,2,B0007TKH66,"I really wanted to like this series. The ship looked great, as did the uniforms, and the chance to see how the Federation was formed was too good to be true.

Literally.

Instead of getting the back story of Star Trek (doesn't anyone understand what a prequel is for?), we get all new aliens never before seen or mentioned, despite the massive effect they have on Earth.

Still, I tried to give this series a lit of slack, even defending it to a friend who gave up on it much sooner than I did. I explained away their naive and often idiotic decisions when encountering hostile aliens by the fact that they were more of the astronaught mentality, not military. That could only go so long.

What totally turned me off, however, was the episode in which Flox (sp?) discovered a cure for a dying alien race and decided NOT to treat them. Yep, that's the doctor I want on my ship. ""Sorry Captain, but by contracting this disease, you are obviously SUPPOSED to die. Besides, if I cure you, Commander Tucker might not get to be promoted to Captain.""",1223424000,4,1043,4.473684210526316
2243873,5,B0007TKH66,"I have watched all of Enterprise and it is easily the best Star Trek series since the original.  Yes, even better Next Generation, which was less than perfect for me.  And far better than DS9 and Voyager which were mixed bags, with less than compelling and irritating characters, and repetitive story lines.  Enterprise drags a little in season 3 but picks up again for the final season.",1220400000,2,387,4.746268656716418
2243874,5,B0007TKH66,"We've been talking about ordering this for a long time and couldn't decide between individual seasons and the boxed set.

It was exactly what we expected and we're having fun watching it and looking forwarding to ordering the following seasons!  Shipped in the time frame expected and received ptomptly.  Thanks!",1219881600,,435,5.260869565217392
2243875,5,B0007TKH66,"no robots learning to sneeze, whistle or growing beards, telling stand-up jokes and tap dancing. no goofy kids saving the day- enterprise was gritty and more real. this was not just ""star trek"" -this was great epic stories with visuals that looked like feature films. enterprise from the start of the series was bad to the bone and when it really hit it's stride it blew away all other treks(except deep space nine-which is my other fav.) enterprise was warm and exciting and intense-once you start watching the show you will want to watch more. this show rarely did not hit it's mark- i would give this show 6 stars if i could. i would give sesaon 3 10 stars. enterprise will make your jaw drop, make you yell with anger and excitement. you will feel the pain and joy of the characters. enterprise will make you high five your kids and wife and do tiger woods fist pumps when the good guys get even and give the evil doers what for.",1218412800,3,933,4.430232558139535
2243876,4,B0007TKH66,"Upfront, I love Star Trek. When I was 3 I thought Picard's opening words of TNG were the pledge of allegance. I've seen most, if not all, the Star Treks ever made. So, from NetFlix, I decided to watch all of the episodes in order of every series. Naturally, I began with season 1 of the prequel series Enterprise.

Captain Johnathan Archer (note, JOHN Archer, JIM Kirk, JEAN-LUC Picard, and Kathrin JANEWAY), son of Zephram Cocraine's pal and fellow warp engineer, and warp test pilot, is put in charge of the first human warp 5 vessal, Enterprise. Archer and his crew, including Vulcan science officer T'Pol, engineer Trip Tucker, and Dr. Phlox, seek out new species and new planets (new to humans, at least) and find themselves in the middle of a Temporal Cold War none of them were prepared for...

Season 1 largely deals with humanity beginning its quest amongst the stars. Relations with alien species and the ongoing saga with the Suliban are at a prime in this season, with several of the more minor characters remaining seemingly 1 dimensional for this season. But, for a first season, Enterprise has a surprisingly bold and delightful way about it that only a Star Trek series might have...",1218326400,,1199,4.759615384615385
2243877,4,B0007TKH66,"Enterprise was an interesting show.  Despite the criticism, I watched the entire series while it was on television.  The writing improved in the last season.  The problem with this show was that it failed to follow previous Star Trek canon.  Many people found this disturbing.  Someone not interested in the other shows may enjoy this.

I personally like the first season the best.  My favorite episodes from the series are in this season with the exception of the mirror universe episode at the end of the series.  There are one or two episodes that will put you to sleep.  The acting is top notch, although the vulcan character is not very good in the first season.

If you can ignore the problems with the story line and remember there is a lot of time travel episodes, it's a good show.  I deal with this by pretending this show has nothing to do with the rest of the star trek universe.  In fact, it wasn't even called ""Star Trek Enterprise"" the first season.  They changed the name to improve ratings.  I think B&B should have done a different space show without star trek using time travel.  That was their mistake.

And remember, whenever you see the security officer, think ""Vidal Sassoon ."" (search for the 80s ad, it's funny)",1218153600,,1236,4.60091743119266
2243878,5,B0007TKH66,"It's a well known fact that there are a lot of Enterprise haters out there. But no matter what you may have heard, this series is not at all as bad as some say it is.

The first season box set is a great collection. You get all of the episodes, along with various episodes with commentary and deleted scenes. You also get a disk with more in-depth special features, such as interview and behind-the-scenes looks that you would expect from a quality box-set.

The first seasons was the producers testing the waters, and they didn't do a half-bad job with it. Star Trek: Enterprise is well worth checking out, and the first season DVD is a great place to start.",1218067200,,659,4.43801652892562
2243879,4,B0007TKH66,"I have always been a great fan of the original Kirk/Spock Star Trek - so it took me a long time before I could get into any of the other franchises. It took a couple seasons to get into TNG (I still can't watch the first couple seasons)and I thought it couldn't get any better than Voyager. I never could get into Deep Space Nine or Enterprise. About a year ago, out of desperation, I started watching Enterprise from the very first episode on SciFi Channel - and I was hooked. It is a great story that fills in lots of blanks about the Star Trek Universe. There is a wonderful set of characters that take you back to the beginning of warp travel and meet some incredible aliens. There are lots of good stories and effects to make any fan eager for more. I am now going through the 4 box sets where I am savoring every episode again and again. Don't miss this series!",1216857600,,867,4.228915662650603

This is the last Star Trek series I've seen (I've seen the Orginal first btw)It was at first the one I was most predjudice against, but I watched a few more episodes, and boom, I'm converted.

What can I do short of giving you one million bricks of gold pressed latimum (If I can find any) kissing your feet and hell, I probably walk through New York wearing nothing but a thong to get it, and because I really don't want to sacrifice my dignity, I beg to you, just get season four on, please!
Do I sound crazy? I just got finished watching Zero Hour, and found there was a big, big cliff hanger. Not to mention I'm as crazy as Klinger for Enterprise.

2243883,5,B0007TKH66,"I'm a fan, right from the start with Kirk and company. I was annoyed when ST:TNG came out, because I thought, ""How could they?"" But I gave it a fair chance, and loved it! Next DS9, haven't had the chance yet, but will eventually get to it (wasn't thrilled with the whole ""war"" premise). When Voyager came into the spotlight, I was skeptical yet again, figuring it couldn't have the real ""Star Trek feel"" being stuck in space. I didn't even watch it initially. But it is an excellent show too! Now to Enterprise - I swore to myself I'd give it a fair chance the first time around, and watched it religiously and in much anticipation for each coming week. I enjoyed the show while I was watching it, but found it to be hard to follow - especially with the multiple story arcs throughout the last two seasons. Being the devoted fan, I had to have it when it was released on DVD. I only recently opened and viewed each season, episode after episode and let me tell you, watching it in this manner made a lot of sense! I had come to realize how intricate the plots can be, the characters, multi-demensional, and the effects are truly amazing. The writers took a big, bold chance with continuing arcs, and that was a nice nod to the fans. They were not trying to carefully step on eggshells and write individual stories. They were giving a gift to fans, knowing those who were following each week would be the only ones returning for the next installment. Watching one eppy after the next, I was like, ""Wow!"" that's good writing! The characters were as they should be - newbies in the universe, and not knowing quite how to proceed. They were flawed, made bad (and good, really good) decisions. They learned from their mistakes and experiences, and grew accordingly - but never lost sight of the qualities that Roddenberry had envisioned for future of the human race.",1214179200,,1861,4.525222551928783

The only thing I don't like about the show, especially what's to come, is a particular thread that was inserted dealing with time travel...but I'd come to learn that that wasn't solely the creators' doing, but at the behest of the studio. That said, I definitely enjoyed the first season and would obviously recommend it to die-hard `Trek' fans, but also casual fans of sci-fi, tho in that case, I'd suggesting renting it through Netflix or Blockbuster.",1212537600,,653,4.6869565217391305
2243886,1,B0007TKH66,"It's official: I hate Star Trek Enterprise Season 1. I watched parts of later episodes a few years ago when it was on TV, and it seemed kind of OK compared to the other Trek shows which have come out in recent years. Season 1 is most emphatically not OK.

In Season 1, Vulcan chick has the personality of celery. Tactical officer Englishman is an uptight tosser. Captain American likes puppy dogs. Communication neurotic ... why is she on this show? Doctor Flox is kind of cool in a perverted way. Engineer Redneck is pretty awesome, actually: first sympathetic modern unabashed redneck character on televisions. Ethnic complaint: everyone is an American except for the English guy. In old Star Trek, there was Japaneses, Zulus, Scotchmen and Russians. That ruled. This sucks.

What is the plot of season-1? The plot is, Vulcans are bad, but maybe they're kind of good and need humans help to help them be better people. Back in the mists of Star Trek history, this sort of dynamic was probably designed to get smart people to think about being more filled with pep and ginger, and dynamic people to be more reflective and logical: this is probably a healthy moral lesson. Somehow that dimension has been lost, and it's turned into some pathetic psychotherapeutic point about being more sensitive. Other important plot device: golly that Vulcan chick is attractive. Seriously, the main plot device is adolescent sexual tension between Vulcan chick and the male members of the crew. While I bet this is popular with fans ... it's death to the story telling. I'm always thinking, ""OK, now they're going to tie the Captain to the Vulcan girl, but she thinks he is stinky."" And it always happens: it is boring and juvenile.  More boring than the faceless guys in red always dying in the old episodes.

 Storyline: I can't figure it out. Enterprise aimlessly wanders in space. Some scaly green dudes want to hurt people at the behest of the Mysterious Stranger from the Future. And, there are occasionally cool green dudes with antennas who find Vulcans to be as irritating as I find everyone on this show.  Enterprise Season 1 is what I imagine came out of a focus group of Trekkies. Old school Star Trek was the creation of Gene Roddenberry and his genius. It was Shakespearean in its human insight and moral lessons. This is just a compound of adolescent neuroses, soap opera and techno porn. The fragments of the old series show through: some of the plot is straight from old episodes, and the moments of dramatic tension often involve fixing the transporter and engines.

My rating: phasers on bored and one half a green dancing alien girl.",1211673600,13,2640,4.776315789473684

I was positively wrong.  This Star Trek series was outstanding and was in many ways far superior to its predecessors.  Perhaps because it brought us closer to home and was more straight-forward and down-to-earth about how people think, feel, act and react.  The THIRD SEASON was stupendous while SEASON FOUR was just as good and satisfied some long-unanswered questions to things from the previous incarnations (no, season 4 is not available here; I went out and purchased it on DVD--your loss Amazon).  However, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series.  The reason I gave it only 4 STARS is because I felt that it was unnecessary to inject sexually suggestive scenes to make the series work.

The first episode Broken Bow
Is very important it shows the Vulcans and Human relation after the movie first contact. And humanity first start exploring deeper parts of space.

If you want know what each episode contains read (Ted Merriman review) I'll write down the more important ones and where they tie into the later series; Original, TNG, DS9 and so on.

Strange New World
Some of the crew land on an uninhabited planet. When they start to feeling strange and that they are being watched. This planet is also meantioned by Commander Ryker on the TNG episode Yesterday's Enterprise.

All the other episodes in this season do tie into each other as you will hear the crew talk about what happened to them in the past in season 2 through 4.

I was not a T v  guy when this show was introduced; however, I have  watched in re-runs (Esp. the HD episodes) and have found this show to be brilliant. It was killed off because in America it was  just a bad time for the show. This of course would be unprecedented ( bringing a show from the Ashes after 3 years) but I feel with the right support and enough fanfare it could happen. The Actors who were featured in Enterprise ( with the exception of Ms. Blalock ) Found a special place in their heart for this show and  would jump to be part of ""Enterprise"" again be it through movie or a ""Correctly"" done feature film. In the ""out there""  that we call the world we need a  ""Star trek"" show of some kind ,why not a  version that was vastly popular but never had the chance to flourish?

Unfortunately, by then, most people (myself included) had stopped watching and the show on television and it was cancelled.  I wish network execs would be a little more patient!  Or they should release things on dvd quicker, so people can catch up and get hooked.  I miss the days of long summer reruns when I could catch up on shows I didn't get to see because they were up against other favorites.

I love the original of course, and TNG has its moments amidst its profound 90's Political correctness and horrific costumes, Picard is my third favorite captain. Deep Space nine failed to grab me, although I love those ferengi. Voyager is just embarrassing, Capt Janeway and the enormous bun, Tupac the black Vulcan, female klingon crewmember, 7 of Double D, it made me sick to my stomach. So when Enterprise came onto the scene, I rolled my eyes and expected another crew of insipid whiners and dull storylines, but I was wrong.

Casting Scott Bakula was risky, seeing how he is associated with quantum leap, but it so works. The rest of the crew, Phlox, Tripp, Malcom, T'pol, Oshi, Mayweather all come together in such a symbiotic way, quite reminiscent of the original series and its crew, in fact I dare say, they are better together as a whole. I had my misgivings about the new theme music but its cheesiness grew on me like Barry Manilow singing Mandy. There is not one throw away episode, and there is so much life and love and just ""good old"" star trekiness in the whole first season. Some might Poo-poo on the small things like ""klingons didn't look like that"" and sneer at the logic of the writers, but they have to remember that IF the original series could have made the klingons look like what Roddenberry wanted them to , they would have, so why not honor his original idea?

2243905,1,B0007TKH66,"To me, Star Trek has always been about the future.  What made The ""Next Generation"" wildly successfull was the fact that it takes place farther in the future than the original series. You get to see the progress that the Federation has made in regards to technology and its relationships to other races.  So why did they decide to make a prequel? Talk about boring and redundant.  The producers had a chance to make something that could have pulled in another generation of viewers and completely blew it.  Now the franchise is basically dead in the water.
The actors try their best but the characters are static and uninteresting. The writers try to take some half-hearted chances in the final two seasons but by then it is too late.  I grew up watching Star Trek and love the concept but its old and stale.  I think that the franchise owners need to watch shows such as Buffy, Battlestar Galactica and Farscape. Maybe then, they will get a clue and take some risks with the storytelling and the direction of the franchise.",1170806400,3,1024,4.629834254143646

Rather than watch episodes I've already seen, Enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy Star Trek episodes.

I felt that the retro-look of the show was done successfully, the cast was very good, and I enjoyed the tensions between the humans, the Vulcans, and the Andorians.

2243908,1,B0007TKH66,"I tried to give ENTERPRISE a chance. I was excited to see how the Federation and Starfleet first developed and what happened soon after the discovery of warp drive. But the show didn't deliver on those promises in the first season.

I could (possibly) have forgiven all glaring inconsistencies about the ship's naming and the technology, the bland crew, and the 'Patch Adams' theme song if - IF - the NX-01 hadn't started off by meeting alien races that were not discovered until centuries later. Picard encountered the Borg first? Nope, Archer. Ferengi? Archer. And on and on and on. That was not only flagrant, unnecessary retconning, it was totally against the (alleged) premise and promise of ENTERPRISE: They missed so much opportunity to show how the charter Federation members were discovered and eventually allied with. A virtual warehouse of cultures to explore and flesh out and they pick ones from the TNG era that have been done to death? That was the last straw for me.

I understand they finally got around to doing this when the show was in its death throes but I wasn't around to enjoy it by then.

Exploring the charter races, I mean.

Well, the death throes, too.",1161820800,34,1181,4.7745098039215685
2243909,2,B0007TKH66,"""Enterprise""... the woefully misbegotten stepchild of Star Trek.  This series had its moments and the cast was quite good, however the show was bad..  In fact, it was awful.  The blame for this miscarriage lies solely with Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who only cared about how much further they could milk the franchise and take advantage of the fans' eagerness for Trek.  Why the unusual theme song?  Because they wanted to milk the franchise for a radio hit like ""Dawson's Creek"" and make even more money selling that.  To these two bean-counters, Star Trek was just a commodity... a cash machine to run into the ground.  In fact, it was these same two gentlemen who destroyed the movie franchise as well as the TV series.  How?  Terrible, terrible writing.

Mr. Berman and company used largely the same stable of writers that they had been using since at least 5th season TNG.  Story ideas became cannibalized and recycled, and eventually simple retreads fitted to a different cast.  One of the great things about the original series was the inclusion of stellar SCIENCE FICTION writers such as Theodore Sturgeon, Harlan Ellison, and Robert Bloch.  Instead, with no new blood the Star Trek series became more of a soap opera set in a science fiction setting instead of a show exploring new and imaginative ideas.  The science fiction element became just a trapping... a garnishment.

One of the great disappointments of Enterprise, for me, was the look of the show.  I was expected to believe that this show took place before the original series, yet the uniforms, the technology, the aliens, and even the ship itself looked light years ahead of anything that had come before.  Branon Braga's comment that ""You can't please everybody"" in regards to the anachronistic set design was a monumentally arrogant statement.  If you do a prequel, it is incumbent upon you to take into account the future.  That means everything, including the set design, should be related to and building toward what was seen in the original series.  With this glaring error, it is difficult to suspend disbelief.

Plus, there were story elements that were being shoehorned into continuity that simply did not belong.  Extensive and complicated time travel stories?  Turtle-headed Klingons?  Ferengi?  These things did not exist within the Star Trek universe timeline until later.  Again, to simply ignore this fact when you are making a prequel is a testament to the arrogance of Berman and Braga.

The actors are very much up to the task, but the ideas had dried up long ago.  There are still some gems to be had from this mess.  However, I would suggest renting instead of buying... especially considering the exorbitant price Paramount affixed to these DVD sets, yet another indication of the let's-squeeze-as-much-cash-as-we-can-from-the-gullible-fans  ideal that eventually came to drive the Star Trek franchise.

Two stars is all, I'm afraid.  I can't blindly heap on a five-star rating simply because it's Star Trek and I'm supposed to be a fan.

Mr. Berman, Mr. Braga, you've made a cynic of me.  Damn you for that.",1160092800,45,3105,4.976653696498055
2243910,5,B0007TKH66,"I have been a fan of Star Trek since it's inception. The original series is the benchmark by which other sci-fi series are compared. When The Next Generation was introduced I was sceptical. I watched but only when I didn't have anything else to do and remebered when it was on, there was nothing that drew me to the show. I didn't particularly like any of the characters. Picard, Riker, Data, they were good character's but even after seven years they all seemed shallow and unrealistic. Kirk, Spock, Bones were all infinitely more realistic and believable.

Paramount continued after TNG with DS9 and then Voyager and the same weakness permeated those shows as well. I noticed how it became common for the crew to develope some new method of modifiying thier equipment to fix thier problem, but it always made me feel like they hadn't overcome the problem just circumvented it. The answer to every problem can't be remodulating the shield harmonics or focusing a tetryon beam through the main deflector, and yet it was, a large majority of the time.

Then I saw Babylon 5 and it assumed the spot right below TOS in my list of favorite shows. It had it's problems and was weak in some points but did more of what the other Star Trek shows should have done.

I have since watched Firefly and the Battlestar Galactica redux each are very good in thier own right. Firefly is particularly well done rivaling Babylon 5 in it's enjoyment value and storytelling, it's character's are on par with Kirk and his crew, it was a very good, if short lived show.

Then along comes Enterprise, which I initially didn't bother watching. I was so disappointed with the other newer Star Trek series and the fact that other shows had come out and easily overshadowed them that I new Enterprise would be an abismal failure, and to a degree it was a failure. But while deployed in Iraq with the National Guard I was sent the first season but I didn't even watch it until I got home, I even managed to get my wife to watch it and the only other Sci-Fi series she has ever been able to watch was Serenity, otherwise she hates Sci-Fi altogether. But then we started watching Enterprise and not only did my wife love it but I did as well.

The characters are the best I've seen portrayed in any of the series, and any of the other series I have mentioned. The stories are phenomenal. The Enterprise, internaly, is the most realistic design I've seen yet. I served in the Navy on submarines for ten years prior to joining the National Guard and the Enterprise reminded me of being on one of my old boats, right down to movie night.

I don't understand why other Star Trek Fans didn't seem to like the show. I did find some weaknesses, such as the episode with the Ferengi who have, in my view, been one of the worst things introduced into the Trek Universe. They were poorly concieved and equally poorly done, I never felt that Starfleet needed an entire race of moron's to contend with.

Another weakness was the episode with the Borg a race just as useless as the Ferengi but for different reasons. The Borg were introduced to Starfleet by Q which I think was the greatest mistake that was ever perpetrated on the Star Trek Universe. The Borg are senseless machines and utterly worthless as characters. There is nothing to fear, nothing to hate, nothing to immortalize them, they are like the Enterprise D and Voyager, fantastic pieces of technology but with no emotional connection. And to try and maintian the link to the other series they were included in a very good Enterprise episode, it's only weakness being that they were in it.

I have given Enterprise First Season five stars and the second season is equally spellbinding. The third season by this accounting would require seven or eight stars it is truly phenomenal and the fourth season looks promising.

This is by far the best Star Trek series ever made, of course it wouldn't be quite as good if they had never made TOS but I think it would actually be better if they never made TNG, DS9 or Voyager. If you like Star Trek watch this series, if you don't like Sci-Fi, try this series, it is utterly fantastic.",1153440000,5,4150,4.567204301075269
2243911,5,B0007TKH66,"I`m a proud owner of all the star trek series and thought i would take a chance with the often bashed Enterprise.  I expected it to be horrible and badly acted but was pleasantly surprised.  I find it to be interesting, funny and well played out.  Almost realistic (or as realistic as one can get when talking about people flying around in space ships).  Effects are great and I found the storylines interesting.  I kept looking for what it was that bothered fans so much.  Sure, the Vulcans were a little too emotional for a people who weren`t supposed to be and the uniforms were a little strange but overall I liked it. The only issue I could see fans not liking was that it was too down to earth in that the sets were small and more submarine like rather than the sprawling niceties we are acostomed to (with the exception of the Defiant) and very dark as opposed to the brightness of the Enterprise or Voyager.  I believe that Enterprise, much like DS9, showed a grittier, darker edge to Star Trek and most fans like the everything is happy and easy to solve aspect of the Star Trek.  I personally believe that the darker aspect of Star Trek is the more interesting and think that is when the best writing comes out (ie DS9).  So, if you`re looking for Wesley Crusher or Q, this is not for you.  If you`re a fan of brooding Odos and dark storylines, I think you`ll like it.",1152230400,13,1378,4.368627450980392
2243912,5,B0007TKH66,"Good space Sci-Fi is hard to come by. And Star-Trek (TOS) created a lot of fanatics that were spoiled by great Star-Trek concepts for years. I speak for myself when I say that Enterprise was one of my favorites! Whether from great story lines, Computer graphics, or acting that was actually believable so you were locked into the story and couldn't wait for next week. The crew of the Enterprise was an outstanding cast that had personalities you loved. And we finally got a good Vulcan again. Jolene Blalock did a superb job and Scott Bakula was an obvious choice for an early pre-federation Captain.

 This series of Star-Trek makes you want to get going on space travel and since Kirk and Spock, We forgot about steps to get to where they were. The first time the transporter was used in an emergency situation made you proud. And the early dangers of space travel and new species that we took for granted were great writing.

 I was very sadden that Enterprise never got to go as long as The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, or Voyager, but it was some of the best Star-Trek concepts ever... I will watch these disks over and over so this was a great investment",1152144000,15,1163,4.523809523809524

You know, I respect how difficult it is to write a television show. To keep plots fresh every week, to keep things tight in only 45 minutes, to watch the pacing, keep everything in character, to provide a variety of moods ... certainly I know I couldn't write anything as good as even the worst episodes of Babylon 5 or the X-Files.

But even I could have done better than this. I swear that it would be plausible that this entire series was farmed out as an experiment to a high school creative writing class, were it not for the fact that even this methodology would have to have produced at least one decent script, something which this show manifestly fails to deliver.

Star Trek: The Next Generation was a good show, but even it had episodes that were truly unwatchable. Enterprise, on its good days, aspires to be as good as the worst of Next Generation. The rest of the time, this show is so gut-wrenchingly, mind-bogglingly bad that it defies easy comprension. Especially since it's due to one reason and one reason alone: appalling writing. Scott Bakula is a proven fine actor. The sets and effects are very nice. But all that is for naught without a script.

I am not sure what caused this but it seems that the company could have done a little better job recording the DVD's. However, I would recomend this show. It isn't the best Star Trek made but it still rocks. If you have not seen all the shows or if you are like me and want to enjoy the show without commercials it is well worth the money. It is also worth it because you can watch the to be continued episodes right after each other if you want.",1139875200,,742,4.159722222222222

It's pretty cool too see them react to a hologram room, food replicator, tractor beam, photon-torpedo, or using a transporter on a human for the first time while all the previous ST crew took those technologies for granted. Even though I only saw the first season I can tell Archer is the perfect captain for this crew, he acts like a father-figure to the crew, always taking risk, always show compassion for other species. He has the perfect characteristic for an exploration crew trying to fit humanity into the galaxy. If you're new to Star Trek, it is still worth watching, even though you may not know what a ""Klingon"" is. Despite your experience with ST, most of the episodes are very thrilling.

2243918,1,B0007TKH66,"What was the problem with enterprise? There are many opinions, but upon closer examination of the show the problem is not the choice of actors or failing ratings. Scott bakula must have been happy when he was chosen for this role and probably thought rightfully that it was the role of a lifetime after all it made William Shatner a  household name. Many people have complained that he was a wrong choice for this role, but he was perfectly suited for it. This actor , in fact all the actors that graced the small screen in enterprise were more than competent, particular Bukula.

Scott bakula was an actor best known for a role he had in another TV show that was long running.  In this show he played a wide variety of roles some even female, and some in different historical settings. This would have been too much for most actors ,but Bakula  managed to succeed and hit a bulls eye constantly. Just this show alone proves Bakula is an outstanding actor that can handle any role tossed at him.

John Billingley is another fine actor, pay close attention to his facial expression and mannerisms, particularly in the temporal cold war arc and in later episodes. He manages to capture the psychological portrayal of his character despite the laughable lines that come out of his mouth. The problem with enterprise lies with the writing particularly the script. The actors do an above average performance with sub- material.  Even outstanding actors cant save a sinking ship- and the enterprise was a sinking  ship, literally a sinking star ship. Without solid writing a TV show or film will not survive and prosper. Despite its expensive budget, state of the art special effects and a name brand recognized by millions, and flawless sets enterprise should have succeeded and gone where star trek didn't go before. But enterprise only managed to cause embarrassment for everyone involved  especially the actors who tried their best with the trash handed to them. They deserved better than this and we the viewers deserve better.

The actors are probably going to be blamed for this shows failure maybe even vilified, but anyone with intelligence knows it wasn't their fault the enterprise sank. Without good or even average writing a TV show cant survive, this show sadly suffered from all aspects of bad writing- derivative and ill-conceived plots to a far fetched premise and down right embarrassing scripts. The actors had nothing to do with this mess, bakula and billingley are more than competent actors I  would even call them outstanding- just check their other work out .

Enterprise was a  bad idea that should have never seen the light of day  or in this case the darkness of space.",1137110400,12,2690,4.821739130434783

Since every philisophical, social, and even action type sequence has already been experienced in the Star Trek universe, there's only one thing to do: Relive it all again and pretend it's the first time that Klingons threaten to kill your family, the borg attack, the ferengi comically appear, ect.  If you completely ignore all of the ""origin"" story arcs in the original show and Next Generation, you'll be ready to reel in suspense, laughter, and on occasion, think deeply about the oppressed third sex of some weird alien culture.  People complain that the series is being ruined, a dead horse is being kicked, and that Jolene Blalock is being used as a sex-object.  Well guess what, the horse is an immortal super horse that can never die, no matter how much the fans try to bury it and live in the past/future, however you look at it from a temporal cold war perspective.  And on the subject matter of poor, poor T'Pol being objectified :(, have you forgotten Seven of Nine?  Deanna Troi?  And let's get off our high horse and think about the SEVENTY THREE women that Kirk's been with.  Sexuality was more suble in the past shows, were a more open audience now.  It's not as great as Next Generation or Voyager, but it's going places.  You may not like where it's going, but it's kept Trek alive.

Regarding the performances, I enjoyed the extra feautures (especially the piece on Scott Bakula) as they give fans a brief inside look at the actors and their feelings about their performances and the show itself. The other features about various creation and production aspects of the show were also worth watching.

The physical packaging of the Enterprise disks is cool and elaborate. After a while it becomes a bit of a hassle to remove and replace DVDs from the box. However, as Enterprise will sit on a shelf as part of my collection, I appreciate the slick appearance.",1134259200,3,831,4.845070422535211

And don't let those belitting negative comments get to you to not buy the DVD set because I think Enterprise had alot of potential.

The story-line about the temporal cold war is fantastic, and I am glad that there are no cute characters.  Phlox is eccentric at times but never annoying.

  Why this show did not make it is a mystery, but it certainly did not suffer due to quality.  At the end of the day, it stands with TNG, DS9, VOY and TOS.",1126310400,5,561,4.3173076923076925
2243926,4,B0007TKH66,"CONTENT

 Season one of ""Enterprise"" was a bold, new beginning for the venerable ""Star Trek"" franchise.  Creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga set out to create a new type of ""Star Trek.""  Their intention was to reenergize the declining ""Trek"" behemoth by going back to (even before) where it all started.  The result was a prequel that predated even the original ""Star Trek.""

 There were a number of notable alterations made to traditional ""Trek"" with the inception of ""Enterprise.""  Unfortunately, the majority of the fan base felt alienated (pardon the pun) by a number of these changes.  The concept of a prequel did give quite a few fans pause.  There were also some more subtle changes that did garner (in some cases deservedly) feelings of trepidation.  These changes ranged from a lyrical theme song to a letter box format.  Not to mention, there was a great deal more of blatantly gratuitous sex.

 Despite many of the changes made, the emphasis on the characters being inexperienced, rash, and imperfect (in other words, human) was a wonderful aspect of the series.  This particular feature of the show is probably best exemplified in its first season which, despite earning an abundance of criticisms among the fans, was undoubtedly the finest first season of any of the previous ""Star Trek"" series.

 Being the first humans to venture out into space was an excellent premise which instills the show with a sense of wonder, as everything and everyone is new.  The characters of ""Enterprise"" are most certainly accessible to the viewers.  Archer isn't all high and mighty like Picard.  He makes mistakes.  He has problems with his own personal prejudices.  He even has a dog.  In that respect, ""Enterprise"" was remarkably refreshing.

 That is not to say that the Archer character couldn't have used some polishing.  Bakula's performance is at times on the weak side.  And he doesn't always portray the rogue ""Han Solo""-like captain envisioned by Berman and Braga.  With that said, his performance is, on the whole adequate, if not a bit rigid.

 Tucker, the ship's engineer, most certainly embodies what ""Enterprise"" is about.  He's your average guy and a little a naive.  He also comes from the school of thought that advocates impulsively thinking on one's feet.  In hindsight, Conner Trineer may have been a more apt choice for captain, as he exudes a stronger command presence.

  T'Pol, at first glance, can be labeled merely T'Pol of Nine.  However, she exhibits character traits that reveal someone who is both brave and loyal.  She and Archer develop a relationship that is akin to the friendship that was between Kirk and Spock. This relationship comes off rather effectively, especially in episodes such as ""Shadows of P'Jem.""

 Dr. Phlox is one of my favorite characters among the crew.  Played with infectious enthusiasm by John Billingsley, he is a new take on the ship's doctor.  His sickbay is littered with various creatures which are employed in multiple capacities to heal the crew.  One criticism, that I have always held since the show's inception, is that Phlox is something of a merging of both The Doctor and Neelix from ""Star Trek: Voyager.""  While it may be a legitimate concern, Billingsley brings a unique character dynamic to the part that would never have been possible with either Neelix or The Doctor.

 Hoshi, Reed, and Mayweather are all interesting character concepts.  They are also very easy to identify with.  Hoshi is definitely the TV viewer who just happens to be on the show.  She's not as calm and serene as some of the other more seasoned officers.  She gets sick when the stars are going the wrong way and environmental suits make her claustrophobic.  Reed is in a similar vein as Hoshi.  Somewhat uncomfortable in social situations, all he really cares about is his work (blowing things up).  Mayweather is still something of a blank slate and his status as a ""Space Boomer"" was never explored to the fullest.  Nevertheless, they are all interesting and, at times, compelling characters.

 Incredible writing and production values launch ""Enterprise"" with the pilot ""Broken Bow,"" a sprawling story, that introduces the ""Enterprise"" characters and primary villains, in the ""Star Trek"" franchise's finest pilot ever.  With a budget estimated by FX Magazine to be at 10-15 million dollars, it is a theatrical quality production.  Indeed, ""Enterprise"" displays some of the finest production values ever scene on a ""Star Trek"" series.  Completely CG ships and aliens appear on the show on a regular basis.  Additionally, a sizeable number of rather realistic looking sets were constructed for a number of episodes.  Other episodes that display a trend of excellent acting, writing, and production values include ""Breaking The Ice,"" ""Cold Front,"" ""Sleeping Dogs,"" ""Shadows of P'Jem,"" ""Fallen Hero,"" and the masterful finale ""Shockwave.""

SPECIAL FEATURES

 The ""Enterprise"" season 1 DVD box set boasts a fairly large amount of extras compared to other ""Star Trek"" DVDs.  Unfortunately, a large amount of them seem padded and trivial.  The audio commentary on the pilot is somewhat interesting.  However, it can be tedious at times.  Berman doesn't have much to say beyond the occasional narrative discussion or how he liked a certain scene.  This leaves Braga to try and figure out things to say.  Some of the tidbits they mention are interesting, and it is worth a watch.

 The text commentaries by Mike and Denise Okuda are for the most part gratuitous.  They are loaded with sometimes obvious and pointless bits of ""Trek"" trivia such as ""A prequel series opened up new ideas for story telling"" or ""This scene was filmed on stage 8.""  Again, like the audio commentary, there are some interesting tidbits, but nothing to get excited about.

 The ""O Captain!  My Captain!"" documentary was a little too sweet.  To coin a phrase by Lt. Torres, it felt like my blood sugar level was going to overload.  I expected an in depth analysis of Archer's character much like the character bios from previous DVD sets.  You won't find that here.  Still, it is obvious that the cast admires Bakula, and he does set the tone for the set.

 Some of the other feature were blatantly repetitious, however.  The ""'Star Trek' Time Travel"" feature is nothing but pointless padding.  Rather than discuss  the Temporal Cold War, a text summary of all ""Star Trek"" time travel episodes are included.  From the looks of the ""'Enterprise' Secrets"" feature, it's obvious that ""Enterprise"" doesn't have too many secrets.  Nothing wrong with this segment except that it is ridiculously short.  The rest of the features are generally good.  However, the highlight is definitely the blooper reel, a hilarious collection of line fumbles and deliberate pranks.

 The inclusion of deleted scenes is something that is long overdue on ""Star Trek"" box sets.  While many of the scenes deserved to be cut, it is a nice touch and definitely bumps the quality of the extras up a notch.  Hopefully, in the next box set the special features will be a little more substantial.

SOUND/IMAGE QUALITY

 Those expecting an immersive sound experience, should not hold their breath.  Just as the other ""Star Trek"" DVD sets, the 5.1 surround emits, primarily, from the center speaker.  However, dialog and other sound effects are perfectly clear.  You may even hear sounds from episodes that were too muffled to be audible when originally aired on UPN.

 Image quality is also crystal clear.  Scenes were bright and not in the least bit grainy.  It was rather impressive to view ""Enterprise's"" CGI effects with perfect clarity.

PACKAGING/MENUS

 Paramount packed all 25 episodes of season 1 onto 7 rather plain looking discs, though they are not as plain as the ""Voyager"" discs.  The packaging is not as awkwardly shaped as the original ""Star Trek"" sets or as cumbersome as the ""Next Generation"" sets or as fragile as the ""DS9"" and ""Voyager"" sets.  However, the packaging is a little too elaborate.  In order to remove a DVD one must first crack open the stylish (and tough) silver shell.  One then removes a 7 page plastic DVD booklet.  Then one removes the protective plastic skin that protects the booklet.  Then the DVDs are accessible.

 As I said, the casing is elaborate.  However, considering the overall poor quality of past ""Star Trek"" box set packaging, the ""Enterprise"" sets are quite good, as long as you don't mind taking an hour to acquire the DVD, you want.  It also seems a bit odd that the only markings that would differentiate each season box set is in a small crevice on the side.  A nice ""1"" stamped onto the front under the title would have been nice.

  The menus, which are excellent facsimiles of the control panels seen on the starship sets, are beautiful and functional.  They are definitely the finest menus Paramount has slapped together for the ""Trek"" box sets.  We can also be thankful that someone had the foresight to make the ""Enterprise"" menus the only ones that don't have the theme song playing in the background.

 If your a fan of the show, you will most certainly enjoy this box set.  If you are new to the franchise, ""Enterprise"" may be the show for you.  This box set is certainly an excellent introduction to the world of ""Star Trek.""",1125187200,5,9280,4.932598833441348

2243929,5,B0007TKH66,"Being a hardcore Star Trek fan since 2002, not as long as some of you, I was sorely disappointed when I found out I don't have UPN or no other channel that carried Enterprise, still don't. But salvation came when this DVD was released. I could finally see Enterprise and I have to agree with a lot of fans, this series was cancelled way before it's time.

Star Trek Enterprise is a very interesting series that deals with how everything came into being, the first episode ""Broken Bow"" alone introduced how the transporter beamed its first person aboard a ship. The story is a refreshing throw back to the TOS era, seeing the return of some of the classic TOS props, but with a more updated look. To describe it, this is like TOS with a DS9 storyline. Very dark storyline with a few casual jokes thrown in, but when they do have jokes, they are hilarious! Watch Malcolm's fantasy about T'Pol on the episode ""Shuttlepod One"" for a great example, it is hilarious!

The actors fit perfectly into their characters. Scott is Archer, Connor is Trip! They fit in so perfectly into their characters; I couldn't picture anyone else that could be cast in the role.

Overall, this collection lived up to everything I hoped it would be, another great series that I can say that was definitely cancelled before it's time, and I heard it only gets better. After watching Season One, Star Trek Enterprise has become my favorite Trek series.  I sincerely can't wait until Season 2 comes out in a few weeks! Bravo Star Trek, you still haven't lost your touch-no matter if you are for at the moment not with us.",1120694400,6,1592,4.555944055944056
2243930,4,B0007TKH66,"I think that there is way too much pessimism concerning Enterprise. I recently bought this set and thouroughly enjoyed it. (I never had payed attention to it when it aired on TV). I love Scott Bakula and really enjoy the relationship between Archer and Trip (reminds me of Kirk and Bones). I really like the whole concept of the temporal cold war, I think think that they could have made a whole other Trek series with the concept. I enjoy some of the stories, for example, Strange New World is cool because Trip starts to ""trip out"" when he is under the influence of psychotropic chemicals. I also love the scene when Trip and Malcolm are in a club on Risa looking for ladies (other Treks didn't portray a couple of guys on shoreleave). I agree with another customer who wrote that the next series should have a fresh start with new writers. I know that there are plenty of Trekkers out there who would love to give new ideas on a series and plot lines.....have we explored Section 31 to its fullest potential? Anyways, I think Trek should take a little break and come back strong with some new talent and get some more publicity.",1120435200,,1131,4.495145631067961
2243931,1,B0007TKH66,"I'm not sure if the decision to make a Star Trek prequel was influenced in any way by the *Star Wars* prequels, but whatever the reasoning, it didn't pay off.  The recent cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise (originally just titled ""Enterprise"") is vindication to myself and others who used to be Star Trek fans, but feel that the series (or as the execs call it, the ""franchise"") has long since lost its way.  I was reminded of the reasons I dislike the newer Trek shows recently when I tuned into Enterprise and in a matter of one minute heard the words ""gravimetric"" and ""anamoly"".  Trek used to be about good, smart storytelling, and not about technobabble and using technologocial ""deus ex machinas"" to solve their problems each week.  In fact, one of the early Star Trek writer's guides states that, while grounded to the best of their abilities in science, the episodes should not rely on science at the expense of storytelling (or something to that effect).

While Scott Bakula is good as Caprain Archer, I had a hard time telling any of the other characters apart.  This wasn't due to a lack of talent or skill on the actors' part, but rather the writing, and for that matter, costuming, made it hard to distinguish one from the other.  Then there's that whole matter of a ""temporal cold war"", the alien alliance which looked all-too similar to the seperatist aliens in ""Attack Of The Clones"", and the willingness to just toss Trek continuity out the window.  I'd like to thank co-producer and scribe Brannon Braga for almost single-handedly taking something that I used to enjoy and beating it into the ground.  Sure, it's impressive that he worked his way up the Trek totem-pole from intern to co-producer, and that he hooked up with Jeri Ryan, but the guy has no respect for the fan base that made Star Trek a success, and not a short-lived, forgotten TV series.  And don't I sound like a total geek now!  But in all seriousness, Trek used to be an enjoyable TV series with important social commentary (not to mention entertainment value), but is now off the radar for the forseeable future.  Paramount, if you're reading this, please do the following:

1. Bring in a fresh producer and fresh writers.

2. Create a new series.  It doesn't have to be some mega-original idea, just something that will entertain and not INSULT the core audience.  Maybe give George Takei the opportunity he's been asking for, and create a Captain Sulu series -- this would interest the hardcore fans who have long-since tuned out.

3. Give it a modest budget, and don't overkill on the merchandising.  Let the stories do the talking.  Braga says the fans have Trek ""fatigue"".  That's only partially correct -- we aren't fatigued of Trek, we're fatigued of BAD Trek.",1120435200,25,2759,4.7322175732217575
2243932,3,B0007TKH66,"I am always careful when I see 5 stars or 1... This show was certainly better than Andromeda or Firefly, but it was no Babylon 5 or Farscape... Of all Trek series, it was the worst... In a way, it's very similar to Voyager, what's the difference between being stranded far from home (Voyager) and being the only Warp 5 ship being sent on an exploration mission (and thus being alone, again?)...
Was it good sci-fi? Sure. Star Trek has never looked better. But ""Star Trek"", this series isn't. Roddenberry would certainly hate that series... The characters are badly developed and rather dull... They are overgrown teenagers in the way they behave... Most don't even look intelligent while we know StarFleet personnel are often PH.D. in series that take place in the future... They are never truly amazed or in awe when they are seeing things no Human ever saw before... Spock was fascinated, Picard was still curious, and so was Sisko, but Archer and his crew don't seem to be excited by what they do... No passion...
The Vulcans do not behave as they should... In previous Trek series we learn that Vulcans are pacifistic and embraced logic thousands of years ago, while in Enterprise, Vulcan is a military power controlled by often emotional and paranoid people... Why this blatant transgression?
The dialogues are badly written and the storylines lack imagination. Can that be blamed on the fact that Star Trek has been on TV for 20 years without a break? Perhaps, but perhaps not... Star Trek became an industry that wanted to play it safe and adapt to the viewers' expectations... And the viewers, young males mostly, wanted fist fights, space combat and sexy curves... That's what they got... But that's not what Star Trek is about...
Even before the series first aired, I did not expect it would last very long or be very good. It was a mistake to create a prequel to Star Trek. I feared the creators would paint themselves into a corner, and they did... Spock was supposed to be the first Vulcan in StarFleet, but T'Pol will be... The first ship called Enterprise in StarFleet was to be NCC-1701, Kirk's ship, but now it's Archer's NX-01... The Ferengui will have their first look at Humans when facing Picard in TNG, but NX-01 will be boarded by Ferenguis... The temporal Cold War will introduce species we'll never see again, like the Suliban, and later on the Xindi... This Trek series is at odds will previous series... Some will say, ""hey, that's just TV, relax, it's a show""... Bottom line: you want good sci-fi, visually impressive, this is for you, but if you feel the best Star Trek series were TNG or DS9, then know that Enterprise is even less Trek than Voyager was...

I have throughly enjoyed and collected all of the Voyager series, and watched most of the Next Generation on TV.  Sadened by the ending of both, I was looking forward to this new entrant to the Star Tek family.

Where do I start?  Bad scripts, apalling casting and the theme music summed up a ""cowboy western"" meets ""miami vice""  shocker that lost me the moment it premiered.  Scott Bukula wins the award for the worst Star Ship Captain....EVER.  I felt as if TV execs had created this as a bad joke on their audience.

Take note those people who gave this a good review, this series was canned after its 4th (a difficult thing to do considering those of us who found the pace of DS9 unbearable).  This came as no suprise to those who were fans and those who weren't.

2243934,4,B0007TKH66,"I'm not one of those who seemed to hate Enterprise because it wasn't Kirk or Picard and was a prequel to those versions. I always found the level of set & story detail to be amazing (maybe subsequent DVD sets will go into that more). That might be some critic's problem with Enterprise- the NX-01 looked so much better than previous ships.
I did like the introduction of the Klingons(Broken Bow)but didn't care for the Suliban/temporal wars angle (never really handled well then slopped off at the end of third/start of fourth seasons). I don't remember the Andorians (The Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem)all that well from the original series but I ""liked"" the way they were presented here. The Vulcans (most episodes) were very different from what we've always known, too bad it took four years to get around to really explaining that. I am one of those who did like the presentation, just wish they'd handled it better.
Many of the stories are of the ""I've seen it before"" variety but what do you expect after almost 40 years? I wish the series had gone on for at lest 2 or 3 more years. Most of the stories will hold up pretty well with time, better than many in the original series.
I liked the extra's but think the packaging is way overdone (seems to be a Star Trek trait)and dislike the pricing (very high but Amazon is as cheap as anyone when you figure in free shipping)but I'll buy the other sets when they come out, and hope they've got the behind the scenes stuff this set doesn't have.",1118534400,2,1503,4.529411764705882
2243935,2,B0007TKH66,"especially compared to the fluffy ""adventure"" of the reality TV craze that has infected all the networks. I had high hopes for Enterprise; I haven't seen a Star Trek that I really enjoyed since The Next Generation went off the air, and the idea of a lower-tech, and hopefully more gutsy and engaging, Star Trek was appealing.

Unfortunately much of Enterprise is the same tired material that has been done and re-done in all the shows that came before it. Like the original, there is a Vulcan Science Officer. Like Voyager, Enterprise insists on having a ridiculously cat-suited female prancing around. This is made more ludicrous by the fact that she is T'Pol, a Vulcan...is it really logical to wear something so skin-tight that mobility is at stake?

The crew of this first Enterprise face the same situations that the crews of subsequent ships have faced for hundreds and hundreds of episodes; I'm not saying that these situations aren't sometimes interesting and even creative (an unexpected development with Tripp in ""Unexpected"" was delightful) but really, how many times can a captain almost-instantly pacify races who have been archenemies for hundreds of years before it gets tired? How many defiant and/or motivational speeches and words of encouragement can he give before we realize he's some sort of strange hybrid of Captains Picard, Kirk, AND Janeway?

Much of the show's watchability comes from what it doesn't have: high technology, people beaming in and out constantly, etc. It's interesting to watch how the crew of this ship make do without what we've come to see as standard Starfleet equipment: shields, force fields, transporters, and the like.

All in all, if you're a Trekkie you might enjoy Enterprise; you might not. Personally I miss the refined class of Captain Picard and the TNG crew; this show rarely achieves the depth of that series, while retaining all its preachiness - which is, by the way, the single most annoying aspect of the show. We've heard enough about racial tensions and unfair treatment and peace treaties and the like on ALL the other series; it would have been nice to have a show not quite so high-minded and preachy in its philosophy. This frequently makes the dialogue unbearably repetitive, particularly Captain Archer's.

Enterprise is all right, but I wouldn't spend $100 or so on it. Get yourself the complete DVD set of Joss Whedon's lamentably short-lived Firefly for a third of the price; it's smarter, funnier, more creative, more realistic, and FAR better written, proving that a show about the future doesn't have to filled with aliens and highfalutin preaching about The Higher Way.",1118188800,9,2647,5.034246575342466

The writers treated Enterprise like Voyager, which was a boring nowhere concept that they KNEW didn't work.  The ship should have been teetering on disaster, exploring the strange and beautiful.

2243939,1,B0007TKH66,"The latest incarnation of Star Trek devised by producers/writers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, this show promises a lot, as did Voyager, but never delivers.  These writers are so dedicated to a cynical view of what the audience wants and are so formulaic and uninventive in their approaches that this show is just as dumbed-down as Voyager, always heading toward unsuccessful action-oriented and suspenseful scenes to avoid significant character development;  and when character exploration is done, it's so awfully clichd that it stinks of superficiality and remains unmoving.

Back in 1997, Berman was quoted in TV Guide as admiring the awful ""Hercules"" series, which essentially took the ""Baywatch"" premise and added bad action sequences and worse drama.  He said he wanted Star Trek to attract that audience.  So, in that year, Voyager brought in the curvacious Jeri Ryan (who's actually a good actor) in tight-fitting clothing -- so tight she fainted at times.  This became Star Trek's new mission:  appealing to people's pornographic desires in the guise of bad stories set in space.  Even some of the actors and writers started to speak out about how uninspiring it was to work on Star Trek Voyager.

This same writing/producing duo went on to create ""Enterprise"", along with a cheesy, soft-pop intro to win over the stereotypically unintelligent WB-type youth demographic.  The first episode saw them apply a disinfectant ointment on Jolene Blalock's slinky bikini-and-panty-clad body;  over the years there were so many instances of using Blalock's body, I couldn't tell you about them -- mostly because I couldn't continue watching this awful show;  the latest incarnation of which I know (since, like a hopeful fool, I gave the show another chance in season 3, when most shows get a lot better) was Blalock naked and topless holding her bosoms in hand asking another officer to massage her, while she moaned orgasmically.  This all is decent soft porn, but not what the audience should expect from ""Star Trek"".  Now, to the actor's credit, she very much resented being used like this and protested the writers' intentions.

Even TNG saw a significant dumbing down in its later years, as Berman took over.  Any Star Trek story in which these two were significantly involved was always bound to stem from cynical calculations rather than the potential to write as good a story as was possible.  See, for example, all the Next Generation movies;  now, compare those to Star Trek 1 through 4, and you''ll see what I mean.

Now, there is a happy ending to this depressing tale of Star Trek's decline, and that is ""Deep Space Nine"" (1993-1999), which remained largely out of these writers' grasp.  During its run, the show was mostly guided by Michael Pillar and the ingenius Ira Steven Behr, who -- along with some great writers -- always tried to make the show the best they could, and succeeded in creating something amazing by Season 4.  When action was done, it was always exciting, too, propped up by great drama, often brilliant comedy, and fantastic secondary and primary characters.

2243940,5,B0007TKH66,"This is a great season, well worth watching. But, the way TV is going these days, everything is a soap (you can't even watch Battlestar Galactica unless you've seen them all). ""To Be Continued"" was the first credit of every episode by the last season of Enterprise. Even in the ""Final Episodes"" - the 4 parter on the 'Alternate Universe' (that DS-9 did so well with) never even comes to closure! ""This is EMPRESS Sato, surrender or die"", The End. What the??

Regardless, this is a great season and worth owning for any Trekker. Everyone I talk to seems to hate Scott Bakula as the primary (I did too, but he grew on me after seeing this season).

These are all stand-alone, edible for anyone stories, some with great moral questions (on a galactic scale of course) spinning the wheel of how the Primary Directive was forged, etc.

It was a great start, but they had to ruin it. You will quickly run out of fingers if you try to count how many shows are '24' style.",1116547200,2,964,4.435028248587571

Enterprise bored me from the very first episode, and even with the handful of better episodes that emerged in the fourth season, the show never came close to other Trek series. It had no sense of awe, no sense of humor, no original stories, and a wasted premise. Plus, Scott Bakula is without a doubt the worst starship captain ever, a one-note character played by a bland, boring actor. If you want good Trek, look to Star Trek Voyager instead. If you want great sci-fi, wait for Battlestar Galactica (the new series) to come out on DVD. Enterprise is one long snooze, and I'm glad it's over.",1116201600,21,639,4.517241379310345

I have to say too that the theme song was better in the first season.  The slower pacing and tempo allowed the show's premise to settle into the mind.  Unlike many Trek fans, this long time Trek fan thoroughly enjoyed Warren/Watson's theme tune.  It was a perfect change that fit the show's distinction as a prequel to all the rest.  Fans who dislike it simply are missing the bigger picture and ought to go check their emotional disconnect with a local betazoid counselor.

It's a perfect buy.  Fans got cheated with the significantly premature ending of this superb series.  Someday the artists are gonna take over and the bean counters will be unemployed.  bwahahaha!",1115942400,14,897,4.913333333333333
2243943,5,B0007TKH66,"First, the disclaimer: I loved both The Original Series and The Next Generation.  (I'm still working my way to Deep Space 9 and Voyager, which I missed when on television).  Enterprise, however, is far and away my favorite.  If this show had been presented in 1966, it would probably still be in production.  ""Enterprise"" embodies everything I love about the Star Trek concept...space is new and largely unknown, and humankind has just really begun to master space travel.  The ""transporter"" is highly experimental and quirky, ""phase cannons"" (the precursor to phasers) are brand-new, and there are no tractor beams, just the grappler.  The Vulcans, and indeed several space-faring species, have technology significantly more advanced than that of humanity.  All of this ""new"" technology, and the whole concept of the show lends a unique atmosphere of wonder and freshness to the series.

In my opinion the only reason that Enterprise did not last more than its 4 seasons is the overall decline in network television and the concept of situational series.  When The Original Series debuted in 1966 the networks dominated the weeknight entertainment market, and most American households were loyal to their favorite series.  No more.  With DVD players, TiVos, and 500 channel cable, a high budget series like Enterprise has less of a chance.  I am, at least, grateful for the 4 years that this series flourished.  Most of the storylines are excellent, and no few of them are outstanding.

""Enterprise"" has cooler weapons, uniforms, and equipment than the later Star Trek series, and the connection to the present day is still there.  Basically, ""Enterprise"" is set in a time about 150 years from now.  Mankind made first contact with the Vulcans (who found Earth) 90 years earlier, and this shocked and inspired humanity such that we very shortly focused on catching up with the Vulcans, and in doing so war, disease, and most other components of human backwardness were left behind.  The starship Enterprise is Earth's first deep space Warp 5 cruiser, capable of fairly quick transit between star systems.

The cast of Enterprise is terrific.  Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip (the chief engineer), Ensign Mayweather (helmsman), Reid (weapons officer), Dr. Phlox, and Hoshi are all very well done by the actors who play them, and in fact I think that these characters are even better done than most of the cast in later Treks.  Opinions will differ, but that's mine.

The DVD is a great value.  It has deleted scenes, crisp video and audio, and a good interface.  The packaging is OK, in a tricorder like package that is a trifle clunky for putting on a shelf, but otherwise not bad.

""Enterprise"" embodies what I like most about the Star Trek concept: what will humans find when we venture out among the stars, and how will this affect us?  Enterprise is all about this question, with a happy answer than mainly space will affect humanity by bringing out our best and challenging us to greater heights.  This is a great series.",1115683200,12,3023,4.960238568588469

I think the fourth season has been great, and I am sorry that the show has been cancelled, it could have easily gone another season.

The DVD set is the best one out of all the others in the Star Trek universe, done in 16X9 anamorphic 5.1 DD. So if you have a Hi_Def widescreen TV, the show looks exceptional for a TV show.

2243948,2,B0007TKH66,"As with Voyager before, Enterprise repeated the same errors. At its core, the show had promise. With very little of early Federation days nailed down, it seemed like a good idea to go back and tell the story. But instead of sticking with some of the canon that did exist, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman rebooted the entire Star Trek franchise, which angered about 10 million viewers. Season one continued the ever increasing schism between the fans. And while I liked Bakula on Quantum Leap, he -like Kate Mulgrew before him - was woefully miscast. The supporting cast, with the exception of Jolene Blalock, showed their limitations as actors (when they got lines). The stories were mostly retreds of previous Trek episodes and while both Berman and Braga were aware of the issues of continuity, they felt that if the adhered to it too much, then the show could not work. They continued to believe that Trek viewers -at least the newer, younger ones (and, admittedly, the group advertisers like) - were only concerned about the how weird the story was and if it had half naked females parading around. This misstep by them, by fulling ignoring the fans who had watched TOS, TNG and DS9, was increasing ENT's end week by week. Paramount can be blamed also, for not stepping in sooner. Berman and Braga's now almost incestuous relationship with Trek caused then not to see the forest for the tree's. Had they realized that fan base was deeply divided, and had they analyzed who was not watching Trek anymore instead of small band who were, maybe something could've been done. Then again, maybe its doom was already sealed by the time Insurrection came out in 1998. And then there is the fan base. They too can be blamed for this, as this schism did not begin with ENT. It really started with VOY. As a network show, VOY had different standards to live up too than it's syndicated brothers, TNG and DS9. Racier plots and emphasis on action and violence became the criterion, while a device called the Temporal Reset Button was used week after week. And while TRB is a useful tool, but to rely on it for every episode got you caught in a never ending loop of Easter Peep type stories; all full of air with no substance. Plus, people who were in there teens or early 20's when TNG premiered were not 15 years older, wiser and now considered less desirable by the advertisers. ENT was, I guess, designed for the guys and girls who were the same age as the ones who saw the first season of TNG. But these new groups of kids, now brought up on a diet of science fiction being everywhere, felt Trek was a dinosaur. So all that remained, in the end, was a few really dedicated fans who felt that, yes the show was not as good as it could be, but it still needed to stay on because it was Star Trek. I will concur to a point, but that's mostly because I hate reality shows and procedural dramas that have overtaken the air waves. Give me a good science fiction story that challenges the mind, then I'll watch. I once read that science fiction is a dangerous genre, for it can be seem as anti-Christian and anti-establishment. It brings up thought provoking ideas and presents a possible world were there is no hatred, no poverty, and no religion. It's the possibilities that scare people. But even as Star Trek has framed a lot of peoples lives, such as wonderful idea of a utopian world and taught us some good values, it has entertained us for nearly 40 years. Both VOY and ENT might be considered entertaining shows, but they are NOT the next step in Star Trek's evolutionary life that TNG and DS9 were.",1115424000,10,3594,4.539291217257319
2243949,3,B0007TKH66,"NEW REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY:

""Enterprise"" got caught in the web of studio politics immediately. Originally the first season as envisioned by co-crators Brannon Braga and Rick Berman was to take place almost entirely on Earth with the ship being build and the drama that surrounded that (including protesters, etc.)with the conclusion being the launching of Enterprise.

Paramount hated the idea and also didn't like the idea of a prequel that would connect more with who we are now than the 24th century (and, in fact, Paramount wanted the next show to take place BEYOND ""ST:TNG""). The studio compromised with the co-creators only on the grounds that ""Enterprise"" DIDN'T take place entirely on Earth during the first season and focused on the crew's first adventures in space. The temporal cold war story arc was introduced as a compromise since Paramount wanted SOMETHING from the far future introduced into the show.

If you add in the viewer fatigue (the co-creators wanted to take a couple of years between the end of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and ""Enterprise"" but were forced to launch the show immediately)after having three ""Star Trek"" series in a row, it's no wonder that ""Enterprise"", which initially was a ratings winner, lost most of its audience by the end of the first season.

In spite of all that ""Enterprise"" was a decent show during its first season that kept striving for better and finally reached that goal having lost most of its audience by the third season. For every outstanding episode there were two that ranged from fair to mediocre and could have been on ANY ""Trek"" series (and still been mediocre).

""Enterprise"" was shot on film for its first two seasons and HD vide for its third and fourth. The masters were prepared in HD for broadcast. The detail during the live action scenes is pretty good and blacks are fairly good in scenes where there are no visual effects. Unfortunately, the visual effects were shot at 480p or 720p depending on how involved the shot was and these have been upscaled. They STILL look better than the DVD's in that regard with better fine detail BUT the visual effects sequences are softer (particularly those integrated with live action)and the shift between higher def and upscaled is noticeable at times.

The pilot episode looks the worst--it wasn't shot with widescreen in mind (Paramount couldn't make up its mind about what aspect ratio the show would be broadcast in)and has been blown up for widescreen resulting in a soft, grainy look that is filled with artifacts. The good news is that the show improves with each successive episode on the set.

What makes this set especially worthwhile (aside from the improved image qualty -even if it isn't demo quality-compared to the DVD's)are the special features; all of the original special features have been ported over plus we get four new commentary tracks.

We also get a three part documentary on the creation of the show where Braga, Berman and the cast are brutally honest in their assessment of ""Enterpirse"" (Braga being the most honest--he calls many of the episodes crap and takes responsibility as he was the head writer but pointed out that he and those who came over from ""Voyager"" were exhausted and needed a break which Paramount wouldn't give them at that point).

We also get a good featurette with Braga and Berman discussing the creation of the show as well as discussing the accusations that THEY killed the franchise with ""Enterprise"".

While ""Enterprise"" was flawed during its first season (every ""Trek"" series has been except ""Star Trek"" where the first and second seasons were the best)and those flaws still dogged the show during a much improved second season, the show didn't get the shot it deserved. The third and fourth seasons proved how good ""Enterprise"" could be (exceptional)unfortunately most of the audience except die hards had tuned out by that point and UPN cancelled the series (even though the fifth season had amibitions similar to ""Fringe"" with a number of episodes taking place in the alternate universe we glimpsed during the fourth season very briefly).

The A/V isn't perfect but it looks better than the DVD's. Hopefully as we continue to see new seasons released we'll see an improvement in the over all look of the show as well.

I like others was a little dismayed that at first the show didn't really act as a prequel.  I thought this was the best idea for a Star Trek in a long time.  As in the Star Wars prequels we can see how Anakin becomes Darth Vader and how the Empire came about, lets see how the federation and Starfleet come about.  But the show didn't really follow that until season 4.  This is a good season, and I do understand that with a franchise you must come up with different ideas.  If you like Sci-fi and star trek buy this set.  If you want to wait then definitely buy season 3 and 4 when they are released.

Season 4 is the best all around season of any Star Trek series since season 4 of DS9 and it just might be the best season of any star trek series ever!!",1114905600,6,1025,3.9754901960784315

I must admit being a bit befuddled and dismayed by the show's early departure from the established history of the Trek universe; I had hoped we would get to see the formation of the Federation and be allowed to view the genesis of the Federation's conflicts with the Klingons and Romulans. Instead, we were shown a temporal cold-war and the Xindi story arc (if Earth was really devastated by a Xindi attack why did Spock never reference this important bit of history in TOS?). The Xindi arc was well done and I liked it, but it was a diversion from established Trek history.

I did think the main characters evolved nicely over the course of the show, particularly Archer and T'Pol-they took her character to some very interesting places.  Having Lt. Reed's operative status ""recativated"" was also a nice character revelation.

I'm just sorry it took four seasons for Manny Coto and Judith Reeves-Stevens to come on board. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens (authors of some of the best Trek novels) should have been scripting plots from day one, instead of coming aboard only in the fourth season; they know the Trek universe better than the producers themselves. They could also have utilized other great Trek authors such as Keith R. A. DeCandido, Greg Cox and SA Perry.

Though each season had its share of very memorable shows, season four is by far the best, as it got back on track exploring TOS prehistory. Finally, the explanation for the marked differences between the Klingon's of TOS' era and those of the movies/ Picard's time! We were also shown the basis for the antagonism between the Andorians and Tellarites. The two-parter ""In a Mirror Darkly"" was nothing short of amazing! In this episode we get to see the mirror universe Enterprise crew aboard the USS Defiant, one of twelve Consitution Class ships, and sister to Kirk's Enterprise (the Defiant was drawn into ""interspace"" in the award-winning TOS episode ""The Tholian Web"" and lost with all hands). Seeing the alterate Enterprise crew aboard the Defiant was awesome. The produces of Enterprise did a masterful job of recreating TOS starship sets. Seeing what the Tholians actually look like from the neck down was nice as well, although the sense of mystery regarding their full appearance which had been maintained heretofore was kind of nice. And as I said, it was also nice to see Lt. Reed as a covert intel agent in season four.

All-in-all Enterprise was a very worthy addition to the Trek universe; had it not been cancelled prematurely it could have truly gone where no man has gone before.

His character was just so ill at ease and generally stiff it never really won me over. Characters I LOVED though were Trip Tucker and Dr. Phlox, they just had a warmness and geniune feel, they seemed real. Most of the other characters didn't work for me, T'pal was hit and miss, though she had some bright spots.

I would like to see the other Seasons to see how much the show improved like many here say but when the STAR of the show puts you off somewhat, I have a feeling I'll never fully love this series, even though I do respect it and feel it was a decent look at Star Trek.

Lastly, I can say this price point is ridiculous. The original series is justified because it's almost like my religion plus older television just has more replay value for some reason, not so with this. I *might* pay 50, but not 100, no way. Why are Starsky and Hutch $45 with the same run time? Why is my Millennium sets also about $45 with similar minutes and Enterprise is double the price??

Here is a basic plastic woman, nearly naked, and a Bowflex dude rubbing this lotion all over themselves. (the science of it I didn't have a problem with it... it was the Sexiness I did.) I mean, did they REALLY need the eyecandy bit? C'mon!!

But then, as I continue this assassination of the show, they venture out to the Klingon homeworld...

Established cannon also showed that the first time they encountered the Klingons was in space... and it resulted in battle... and that started the war. WHICH wasn't resolved until the Khitomer conference fully 80 years before ""TNG""...

Then the FERENGIs?? Oh COME ON!!

Then the canned ol' Temperal stuff?

Then the BORG??? Jezely Crow, isn't ANYTHING Sacred?

Oh wait, guess not. Here's Dr. Nunian Soong's predecesor!

And for the last show, they're bringing in Riker and Troi! Obviously another time travel stunt gone wrong!

Just rediculous!

And Paramont's always been a stickler about their prices on DVDs... $90 is far cheaper than their original $129.99 for the first season of TNG I remember seeing... bit it's STILL too damned expensive! I have been buying tv season shows for $24.99 - $45.99 (and nearly balked at that last one!)

No, I'm a fan, but I'm an honest one. This was garbage from the getigo. The stupid beagle should have been fed to the warp core a long time ago (and I'm a dog lover!)... I just remember way too much about the early show (Christopher PIKE... HELLO?) that established so much.

They call it SCI-FI for SCIENCE FICTION... not soap opera bull!

Count me outta this one! I stopped watching Voyager after they introduced 7of9... I don't need plastic women to interest me in scifi!",1114473600,28,2559,4.678571428571429

2243966,4,B0007TKH66,"Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action ""Star Trek"" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original ""Star Trek"" series, which ran between 1966 and 1969) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film ""Star Trek VIII: First Contact"".

The new series, entitled ""Star Trek Enterprise"" debuted in the fall of 2001, only months after the previous ""Star Trek"" series, ""Star Trek Voyager"" concluded its seven-year run.  The show's series premiere, entitled ""Broken Bow"", began with the appearance of a Klingon on Earth following a mishap long before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.  To return the Klingon back to his home world, Capt. Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"", that ran between 1989-1993), gets permission from Starfleet to take the experimental starship named Enterprise, with serial number NX-01, to Kronos, in spite of the misgivings from Vulcans, who don't believe that mankind is sufficiently prepared to begin exploring other worlds and encounter more alien species.  The NX-01 is the first man-made starship capable of traveling at a speed of warp 5.  Capt. Archer then assembles the rest of his crew for the new Enterprise, including the non-human Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), the Vulcan Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating), Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).  With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the premiere episode, it initially appeared that UPN, which broadcasted the show, would have another successful ""Star Trek"" series, just as it had with ""Star Trek Voyager"".  Unfortunately, subsequently shows had much smaller audiences that only continued to shrink with each season. The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  It was during the fourth season that UPN decided to cancel the series, even though there were still another three seasons to be produced because the fourth season ratings dropped even further to 3.1 million viewers per episode.

The question, then, is why did ""Star Trek Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  Personally, I believe several factors are responsible.  First, the only truly interesting characters were Dr. Phlox and T'Pol.  The characters of Reed and Trip were often annoying.  However, the most annoying character during the first season was Capt. Archer himself, who repeatedly acted like an arrogant uninvited guest towards every alien species and outpost encountered.  Second, the inclusion of the previously unknown species called the Suliban and the notion of a ""temporal cold war"" from the far distant future ran tangent to the notion that ""Enterprise"" was supposed to be a prequel leading up to the time of Capt. Kirk.  Third, the technology and overall look of the NX-01 often appeared more advanced than what was used in the original 1966-1969 ""Star Trek"" series, which is supposed to be 100 years more advanced than ""Enterprise"".  Fourth, insufficient attention was given to portraying the various extraterrestrial races responsible for for forming the United Federation of Planets: the Vulcans, the Andorians, the Tellarites, and the Alpha Centauris; as well as to other races known during Capt. Kirk's time.  Though the Vulcans were a frequent race depicted in the first season of ""Enterprise"", the only other future founding race of the United Federation of Planets were the Andorians, which appeared in only two first-season episodes: ""The Andorian Incident"" and ""Shadows of P'Jem"".  The blame for these various factors that directly contributed to the premature cancellation of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" rests solely with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Unfortunately, the addition of producer Manny Coto who did an amazing job of reconnected the fourth season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" to the rest of the ""Star Trek"" TV series came too late to save the show.

Of the 26 episodes the comprise the first season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"", the most memorable were ""Broken Arrow"", ""Fight or Flight"", ""Strange New World"", ""Unexpected"", ""Terra Nova"", ""The Andorian Incident"", ""Breaking the Ice"", ""Civilization"", ""Fortunate Son"", ""Silent Enemy"", ""Dear Doctor"" (one of the best first-season episodes), ""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Shadows of P'Jem"", ""Oasis"", ""Two Days and Two Nights"" and season finale ""Shockwave, Part 1"".  One disappointing episode was ""Fusion"", which appeared to contradict descriptions from other ""Star Trek"" TV series that Vulcans had always practiced mind melds; as was the episode ""Acquisition"", which included the Ferengi: a species that had only been introduced in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", 200 years later.

Overall, I rate the first season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was an interesting experiment that had it been given more time, probably would have blossomed into a far better series thanks to the efforts of Manny Coto.",1113696000,99,5474,5.346915017462165

Take my opinion for what it's worth folks. I'm not a 'die-hard' Trek fan. My Trek experiences are severely limited, mostly exposed to the original series and early Next Generation stuff. I'm no expert here. All I'm saying is that with my limited knowledge of the Trek universe, I personally was not disappointed in the least, and will now pre-order this set.

2243971,2,B0007TKH66,"The Show had a great potential. The concept was bold - although not original - and it had a great time to be started at the turn of the 21st century - however - the show show lacked some basic elements.

It lacked interesting characters. Even with a very talented performer like Scott Bakula - without a good script, it just doesn't happen. I feel sorry for Scott and have heard that he and Conner Trinneer both campaigned for a new direction for their characters.

The first season tried its best to flesh out the intrigue but failed in the story arcs. Rick Berman and Brannon Braga killed the series by making it a REAL Soap Opera. (The only thing missing was the Sappy music!)

The show didn't focus on characters or story at all. by the end of the second season - it was apaprent no one was watching and in fact - it was cancelled twice.

Star Trek needs a rest from TV to gain new life and definately NEW blood onthe production side. I am said to see no new Trek, but Berman followed his legacy by killing the Movie franchise and creating ""Nemesis"" and ""Insurrection"" - thereby killing the movie Trek relm as well.

The only reason I gave it a 2 at all was because of its technical achievements. It looks great and Herman Zimmerman did a great job.

I wish it could have been better - but it was more writing and poor execution. 4-1-05",1112313600,15,1340,4.318725099601593
2243972,4,B0007TKH66,"I've read the reviews (most of them anyway) and from what everyone has said, I can tell you this:  Star Trek Enterprise is the best installment in the Star Trek Universe, or the biggest piece of crap that has ever sucked up people's free time.

I watched most of the first season before giveing that up to wait for the DVD sets.  It was too hard to try and find when it was going to be on every week.  Networks need to take note of that.

But anyway, I enjoyed the show quite a bit.  I hadn't really developed too much of a connection to all the characters yet, but they seemed pretty good.  My only complaints would be that Cpt. Archer was a bit wishy washy.  Of course, when you're used to people like James T. Kirk, and Jean Luc Picard, you are looking for someone who will be ready at the drop of a hat to put their foot down.  Hmmm, maybe they wanted to try something different...  Can they do that?

The Vulcan girl.  Yeah, she was a bit strange, and probably way too hot.  I can say that she had the ability to keep my eyes on the screen.  Her looks are used very liberally, like when her and a few other cast members way early in the series (maybe it was in the pilot) have to disinfect themselves, by rubbing a clear lotion all over their finely tuned starfleet bodies.  I liked it, but I sat there feeling that I shouldn't.  Make your own call.

Time travel.  Urk, it's nice that they wanted to tackle some nice time travel stories, but I think that there was a lot of overkill in that area.

The last little complaint is the poor continuity.  I understand that basing a show in the past of timelines that we already are very familiar with is rough, but they did choose to do it.  Hows about taking some time to do it right?

Anyway, I think that it's pretty good sci-fi and fairly good ST, so if you like any of those things, you might want to give it a try.  If you can afford it, that is.",1111536000,12,1901,4.119891008174387
2243973,5,B0007TKH66,"A lot of people slam this show. However, it was a brilliant concept and a great pilot episode. Too bad the people behind it lacked talent for execution of good ideas. They should have hired a better writing staff (like that of season four) and let them take the series where no series had gone before.

And while most episodes in season one were very good, about one out of every 5 were pretty bad. Terra Nova with it's not so clever alien language morphed from English was a low point. But others were super episodes including the hailed Shuttlepod One, which was one of the best Trek episodes of all time.

Out of the 26 season one episodes, at least 15 to 20 were very good, and better than the first seasons of Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, all of which took 2 to 3 seasons before the great episodes actually outweighed the bad ones in any given season.

 TNG had season 3 before it found it's footing. DS9 had to let Avery Brooks Hawk-ify his role before things got good. And Voyage floundered aimlessly like Battlestar Galactica 1978-lite until 7of9 came on board.  In most cases I started watching the previous series in their first season, then bailed out only to return years later when it was in syndication. Even now, I never watch reruns of seasons one two and three of any of those series when they air.

But Enterprise had me at hello. I watched it from beginning to end, and never missed an episode. Sure, season two lost some focus and had too mainly aimless episodes. And season three had it's single story arc which they couldn't keep interesting for a whole season and ended up havng filler episodes to avoid showing the holes in their storytelling ability. But season four got it all right. And just like the previous series, season four was to be the real start of better things to come. But it got cancelled.

People scratch their heads and wonder why it couldn't get the ratings to stay on. Yet no one recalls that all 3 previous series launched in syndication, not on UPN solely. In fact UPN launched on Voyager's back as a network, yet I watched Voyager on the local Fox network which played all Trek shows in syndication. SO ENTERPRISE was the first of the series to actually only have UPN as it's home. So less people were able to see it. Somehow people forget that.

And when we talk about Trek people who slam Enterprise heap praise on the original series, which I can happily say I can't really bear to watch a full episode of. For the time, it was revolutionary, but out of that time... well, it's aweful. No doubt about it. It stinks in a modern context. But then again, I was not born until 5 years after it got cancelled, so I had no original point of entry. The first original Trek cast thing I saw was ST 4 The Voyage Home. From there I became a fan of Trek.

But it is perspective. I like the New Battlestar Galactica quite a lot, but I love and adore the original which came on when I was 8. The original was a classic and will always be. Yet some of the fans of the new series who were born less than 2 decades ago, seem to have a hatred for the original, which offends me. I am sure my dislike of the original Trek offends some of those fans similarly. >But I digress.

Enterprise is great Trek. But like all Trek, is flawed by often weak writing and poor executive producer mindset. But everyone knew that going in. And if they say they didn't, they are having selective amnesia. Go back and watch Seasons one of TNG, DS9 or Voyager. Then watch season one of Enterprise. Tell me which of the four has more quality episodes.  ENTERPISE. Pound for pound, more satisfying than the others.",1111104000,28,3642,4.396731054977712
2243974,4,B0007TKH66,"On September of 2001,the UPN network and Star Trek producer Rick Berman with writer/producer Brannon Braga introduced viewers to Enterprise (later renamed Star Trek Enterprise in season three).
This fifth live action series from the franchise took place a century before James T. Kirk's five year voyage of the original series. This series follows the pioneering voyage of the first warp five ship in the early days of Starfleet, before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.
The crew of the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), consisted of the Vulcan liason/first officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Chief Engineer Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III (The great Connor Trennier), British armory officer Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating),Communication Officer/ linguist Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), Helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), and Denoblian Chief Medical Officer Phlox (John Billingsly).
At first the series was sampled by Trekkers curious about the beginnings of the Federation,which wasn't adressed until the fourth and final season. Soon viewership dwindled by it's racy tone, disregard of continuity, the fact that NX-01 looked technologically advanced to Kirk's NCC-1701,the unnessesary ""Temporal Cold War"" and it's theme song which was a AOR pop song(!!!!).The stories felt prefunctuary as to appeal to a larger audience, which was the previous Star Trek Voyager's biggest flaw.
 Aside from the shows fallabilities, the first season boasted great episodes in Broken Bow (the series pilot),  The Andorian Incident, Breaking the Ice, Cold Front, Dear Doctor, Shuttlepod One, and Shockwave (the season finale cliffhanger).
 Unfortunately,Enterprise would be a troubled production whereas the declining interest of Trek, flawed stories of the earlier seasons, and bad ratings would lead to it's cancellation in season four. The latter two seasons would find the show discovering it's tone under the guidence of Executive Producer Manny Coto.

2243976,4,B0007TKH66,"I am a Star Trek fan and have seen and enjoyed every Star Trek series. My favorite Treks are The Original Series, Deep Space Nine and Enterprise. I would describe the first season of Enterprise as ""hit and miss,"" just like I would the first season of every other Star Trek. I always felt that it wonderfully expanded on the universe seen in TOS, TNG and DS9 (This is where Voyager failed). The season features several good episodes, several mediocre, and a few bad. Yes, there are several shows (Oasis, Rogue Planet) that did not need to be done and at times, characters are underdeveloped in this season. I still believe the good outweighs the bad.

I am possibly one the few fans in the world who found the Temporal Cold War an interesting storyline. I never felt it overshadowed the ""prequel"" elements of the series. I enjoyed how it only surfaced occasionaly in the first two seasons and led to very exciting events in the third. The complaints of violation of canon I felt uncalled for, since most of the complaints delt with violations to fanon, or fiction that fans wrote to fill holes in the Trek universe. Canon was the Trek seen on screen and I felt Enterprise  did a fine job adhering to it, with a few exceptions such as the use of plasma weapons (See Voy's ""Flashback""). Fans were happy with their perceptions of Trek and did not like their perceptions challanged. The portrayal of the Vulcans is a prime example of this, but this is not the forum to debate this topic.

This season also featured many prequel elements such as Andorians (Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem), human colonies (Terra Nova) and the ineffectual weapons (Fight or Flight, Silent Enemy). This season does an great job laying the goundwork for the series. Overall, a good start to the show, at times slow and at times exciting. The second season fails to build on the momentum gathered in the first, but the show really takes off in the third and fourth seasons.

The stories have developped, especially season 4 - you'll see - will be very exciting!
I wish UPN/Paramount/Viacom hadn't cancelled this show, it's high quality TV and thousands of Trek fans worldwide want to save Enterprise together, because Enterprise deserves more than anything else to remain on the air (or should I say in space?!).

Number 5:This is 'Enterprise''s most exciting season to me.
  This is a prequal to Star Trek that,at this time didn't even have those words as part of it's name-it was only called 'Enterprise'.It takes place aboard a flat starship in the mid 22'nd century with less then 80 people on board. The crew have a good chemistry but are more timid and uncertain then the brave Trek characters we've come to know,especially Scott Bakula's Captain Jonathan Archer who always seems unsure wheather to leap forward or backward. These people on 'Enterprise' live in a world without holodecks,deflector shields or even a dependable transporter. They ride around in Shuttle Pods alot and frequently where space suits. My favorite during this season?I have a couple-""Terra Nova"" because the humans seen in that show make the Enterprise crew seem LESS self doubting. The other would be ""Two Days And Two Nights"" about the first human visit to Risa and the season ends with the great shocking cliffhanger ""Shockwave"",the first one a Star Trek series included in it's first season. So at first I was a little put off by 'Broken Bow',whitch is overlong and has sections that are painfully dull but as the season progressed so did the quality. But this is about as good as this gets because in upcomming years Enterprise became incredibly tedious to the point that it had to serialize it's entire third season to keep people's attention and was ultimately cancelled. As of this writing the series finale hasn't yet aired but Enterprise has gone down as the shortest lives series in the francise since the original show in 1966,clocking in at only four seasons. This might have worked magnificantly as a miniseries or a Star Trek television movie but didn't always live up to the promise of this first year. Sadly the reality of 9/11 intruded coldly on this series pilot and in the coming years people have been glued more to the news and reality TV then good ol' Star Trek. Has Trek gotton worse?No-regular network television has and without the mass public interest to back it up this show was almost doomed from the start. So I rate this highly because of the quality FX duty done,the overall historical look of the show and the sense of continuity-not to mention that considering having little reference to go by the starship NX-01 itself is one of Trek's most clever spaceship designs and is ammong my all time favorites. Character developement and writing seem to be the fatal flaw of Enterprise at times and these episodes are as good as it gets in that department.

If Paramount realizes that they stand to make a heck of a lot of money on the DVDs, they might reconsider cutting the show short.  Second:  visit [...] where you can find addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and fax numbers to use to express your support for the show.  Third:  visit [...] where fans are actually attempting to raise enough money to buy another season of the show from Paramount.  In a matter of days this site has already rasied $60,000, and there have been some very large (i.e. seven-figure) pledges from deep-pocketed contributors.  So don't give up!  Star Trek: Enterprise isn't dead yet.  With your help, we can assure it receives the 5th season it so obviously deserves!",1109462400,14,950,4.790123456790123

2243985,5,B0007TKH66,"Star Trek: Enterprise is a terrific show and the first season demonstrates all of the potential possibilities of this concept.  While I will admit that it doesn't always stick to its own premise; the foundations of Starfleet; the founding of the Federation, etc. Enterprise is full of amazing potential, as this set will demonstrate.  We have every episode on videotape and are so looking forward to the DVDs.  You can watch season one and realize that it is quite literally, only a shadow of things to come in season four.  Season three was a little strange, but it ended well, giving us new energy for the fourth year.  Enterprise became a wonderful adventure.  It wasn't always a ratings winner and like all of Star Trek, it has its detractors.  But that's the thing about Star Trek isn't it?  If you don't like one, there are plenty more.  I for example, was never a big fan of Voyager because to me it was a little like Star Trek: Lost in Space.  But everybody has their favorites, and that's the way it should be.  I'm proud that now I can share one of mine.  I think time will judge the series not as unsuccessful, but as a show that developed into something great and was canceled before its time.  By the way, if you enjoy this series, contact Paramount and tell them to give us season five.  For more information on that, you can go to [...]",1109289600,13,1351,4.461224489795918

8051305,5,B0007TKH66,"I came to Enterprise after watching Discovery. I somehow missed this series when it first came out, even though I watched all of the original on reruns, and then all of Next Generation when it first aired. This show is the first flight of Enterprise, and has a gritty near-future feel to it that I loved. It feels like a navy submarine in space, and you can hear people walking around. The theme song is significantly different from the other shows, and at first I laughed at it, but I grew to love it and feel a thrill of excitement every time it started a new episode. When it changed in season 3 I got really upset, and then I grew to love THAT song too. I really loved this series, and it breaks my heart that it ended after only four seasons. I wish I could tell you all the reasons why I loved it, but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say this series and Discovery have both sparked a fire of Trekkian fandom in me and now I just can't get enough.",1525824000,,968,4.1

8051307,5,B0007TKH66,"I have been a fan of the Star Trek series since I was a kid. I started on Generation and the mid/late 1990's movies. I have watched DS9 and Voyager (DS9 is far superior) and then watched Enterprise. I recently rediscovered Enterprise and am close to finishing the last and best season.

Enterprise was wrongfully removed from air and was given a horrible send off with the last episode. I know it's only a pipe dream now considering it's been over 5 years, and the cast has moved on. BUT I hold out hope that since the 5th season was written, Netflix might pick it up.

And I hope they do, because the current new iteration of the Star Trek universe (Discovery) is a total joke and not what Star Trek is about (see war mongering and fighting in Discovery). All Discovery has is fancy CGI, the cast isn't even good.

Bring back Archer and Enterprise!",1524787200,,849,4.42948717948718

The cast is outstanding and after I watched the final episode I found myself saddened that I wouldn't get to see the progress of the characters again.  Scott Bacula was a great Captain and the cast was outstanding.  Each Season has about 24 episodes, so be prepared to stretch out your bingeing but by all means, watch this series.",1523232000,2,420,4.573333333333333

8051311,5,B0007TKH66,"Very sad this was not allowed to go on. The final season is the best full year of all Star Trek s in my opinion. I would say that overall Voyager is my favorite series but only beats Enterprise because it had 3 more years to do so.
What would have been cool would have been if where Enterprise left off, ... Discovery would have taken off that is, at the forming of the Federation and all of the problems that must have happened  in that Universe... trying to form and even figure out what... the Federation was or could be.
But Discovery is violent social programing for our times...  and has almost nothing to do with Star Trek.

I've read that the franchise was sold by the producers or somebody to the Chinese! Horribly anti American  piece of Greed if true...  but given who those producers are... it is not that shocking.",1520899200,,827,4.379084967320262
