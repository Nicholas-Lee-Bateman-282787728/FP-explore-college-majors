2567165,5,B000FIHNA2,"The Second Chance is a movie that takes on the complexities of cultural difference and social conscience. The film succeeds in tackling tough contemporary issues in a compelling and entertaining way.

  The Second Chance stars Grammy award-winning musician Michael W. Smith in his first acting role as Ethan Jenkins, a rock star turned associate pastor of a suburban mega-church called The Rock. The film co-stars jeff obafemi carr, a multi-talented artist with experience in acting, singing, writing, and directing. jeff prefers lower case letters for his name as a gesture of humility. His character, Jake Sanders, is the pastor of a small urban inner city church called Second Chance Community Church that deals daily with all the associated problems plaguing the economically starved inner cities.

  Michael W. Smith does amazingly well in his acting debut, considering his only acting experience was working with an acting coach in preparation for this movie. Equally amazing is the performance by jeff carr who nails his character with realism and genuine passion. jeff becomes Jake Sanders.

  The background of the film involves Jeremiah Jenkins (played by J. Don Ferguson) who founded Second Chance Community Church in the 1960's and was part of the civil rights movement. Time has seen him move on to The Rock mega-church. The Rock has become part of the new electronic church era where it's about TV, image, timing, and donations.

  Jerimiah's son, Ethan, is caught up in the image and the worldly business of the church. An affluent yuppie with attitude, Ethan finds himself at odds with the church's leadership after creating some waves. The church's board decides ""he needs his wings clipped"" and they decide to send him to Second Chance Community Church.

  The plot revolves around both pastors, Ethan and Jake, as their cultures clash when Ethan is sent unwillingly to ""observe and learn"" at Second Chance and the surrounding community. Both pastors have their own set of flaws and culturally conditioned attitudes.

  Ethan feels being sent to the inner city is beneath him and not worthy of his time. ""I am an associate pastor, not a social worker,"" he protests when told of his assignment.

  Jake, the Second Chance pastor, also has his cultural conditioning come into play. ""We've seen enough of those ghetto tourists down here ... hanging around just long enough so they can go back and tell their congregations that they've 'been there' "".

  The stage is set for conflict that extends beyond the surface of black/white issues. Both pastors are separated by economic barriers and their views of how to help people and handle problems. Ethan's rich suburban church mentality is to throw money at a problem and walk away. Pastor Jake's method of choice is to roll up your sleeves, get on the streets, and make a difference one person at a time. Some of his tactics are tough-love.

  As Ethan navigates his way through the real life of the inner city, his belief system is thrown into turmoil. There are several memorable scenes in this movie, one of the most compelling is the sub-plot involving the African refugee child's paper plate drawing. Without revealing too much, I will say the associated scenes with this paper plate demonstrate that sometimes the seemingly small things in life can have a huge impact.

  Ethan's acceptance into this different culture is slow. It's a painful learning curve but to his credit, Ethan continues forward. There are failures and there are victories. In one scene we see how music can serve as a wonderful bridge between personal and cultural differences. Acceptance involves doing and taking action, not just words or money.

  As the movie progresses, power, money, and politics threaten Second Chance's existence. Out of the uncertainty, Ethan experiences another defining moment of life that will further serve to ""call him home."" Another defining moment for several characters comes during a foot-washing scene.

  One of the most powerful scenes involves Jake's speech near the end of the film. jeff carr absolutely nails it with passion, emotion, and sheer believability. Michael W. Smith's musical score for this scene using his instrumental song ""The Last Hallelujah"" is perfection.

  Another highlight and thought-provoking moment was Ethan's short rendition singing the song ""Sinking Sand"" echoing how staying in one's comfort zone is standing in ""sinking sand"". The defining moments he has had during his journey have made him realize his own sinking sand.

  The movie could have ended several different ways. According to the commentary information, there was considerable discussion on how the film should end. The ending that was finally chosen worked for me. Its message was clear and thought provoking. It was the right choice.

  Michael W. Smith did the musical scoring for many of the scenes as well as performing and co-writing the track ""All in the Serve"". Michael's son Ryan Smith has since produced a music video of ""All in the Serve."" Michael also performed all of his own piano and singing scenes and seemed right at home doing so. This was probably due to his 20+ years of music and concert experience as well as 18 albums.

  The film was directed by Steve Taylor, his first feature length directing job. Prior to The Second Chance, he made several short films and music videos. Considering this and the fact that The Second Chance was a small budget film, he did an incredible job.

  The commentary track in the DVD's special features section provided some interesting insights to the behind the scenes trials and tribulations that went into creating this movie. Steve Taylor, Michael W. Smith, and jeff carr recounted the obstacles that had to be overcome and how some of the casting assignments came to be. A significant amount of local talent was used. The film was shot entirely on location around Nashville, Tennessee.

  Speaking of casting, many of the smaller roles were perfectly done. Henry Haggard, who played Sonny, the challenged Second Chance Community Church custodian, could not have been cast better. Shirley Cody, playing Miss Burdoe, the choir leader, was simply outstanding. The chemistry between her and Michael was obvious. Jamal, the drug dealer played by Robert Fitzgerald, brought his street character to believable and authentic life. J. Don Ferguson, who played Jerimiah Jenkins, did a memorable job that included his character's humble personal transformation.

  This was a limited release film to theaters in February (2006) and was just released on video in July (2006). The Second Chance movie is from an original screenplay by Steve Taylor, Chip Arnold, and Ben Pearson. The Second Chance is rated PG-13 due to some drug references.

  If you want to experience a great film that was created on a small budget by people who regarded it as a true labor of love, see this movie! The movie's message is one of hope, reconciliation, humility, tolerance, forgiveness, and understanding ... something the world needs now more than ever. [...]",1154304000,6,7066,5.082465277777778
2567166,4,B000FIHNA2,"Having grown up in the church and being a PK , and being prodigal for years, I could relate to many of the aspects of this film about ""church business"" and how it many times leaves Christ behind and the mission/vision of the church gets lost and ends up having very little to do with God.

Pragmatism has crept into churches across our land, and church decisons end up many times being based more on traditional non-profit organization business models and guidelines than about the gospel of Jesus Christ.

I think the best audience for this would be people who serve in church leadership. One of the more subtle lines of thought that should hit home in the movie is how fellacious our overseas missions attempts are when we seem to care less about home missions work , with people we can see, feel and touch their lives; instead of being able to promote what we are doing around the world as a badge of honor.",1154304000,3,910,4.475903614457831
2567167,2,B000FIHNA2,"I am a big Michael W Smith fan, but was very disappointed with this movie.  The wealthy mega-church is filled with only white people while the church in the 'projects' is made up of mostly black people who are former druggies and prostitutes.  I thought this film was attempting to oppose racial bias?  So there are no minorities in the mega-churches?  Only blacks struggle with addictions and illicit lifestyles?

Sorry, but I did not get the point of this movie.  Supposedly this movie was to portray the church as Steve Taylor envisions it.  I sure hope there aren't many Pastors like the ones portrayed in either 'The Rock' or the Second Chance church.",1154304000,4,656,4.752212389380531
2567168,4,B000FIHNA2,"First of all, this film is head and shoulders ahead of most Christian films. It's a film you could show your non-Christian friends without them getting up and walking out. It has great camerawork, and the dialogue isn't canned. The characters seem more realistic than the usual for this genre.

Being a member of a large church, it really hits me that God expects you to get your hands dirty (not just your checkbook) helping the less fortunate. The film is a real wakeup call.

Acting is better than average. Jeff Obafemi Carr does a fine job. Michael W. Smith does a credible job as well. The supporting cast is all first rate.

You may be surprised to hear a few curse words in a Christian film. I always wonder how far you cross the line into the secular world to get a message across. Time will tell, I guess.

Completely out of the character he plays in this movie, Michael W. Smith has done volunteer work without a spotlight, cameras, or his name being mentioned in the press. I personally know of one life he has made an everlasting impact on in just such a situation.

Get the movie and decide for yourself. The curse words shouldn't be nearly as offensive as seeing your Savior nailed to a cross.",1154217600,2,1207,4.468181818181818
2567169,5,B000FIHNA2,I saw Second Chance on a big screen when it debuted and immediately requested copies of the DVD for myself and friends. The film carries a powerful message that our nation needs to hear. Second Chance courageously confronts tough and relevant issues head on while providing great entertainment.,1154044800,,294,5.145833333333333
2567170,5,B000FIHNA2,"With numerous examples of poorly made Christian films--and, even worse, preachy ones--I feared getting my hopes up for ""The Second Chance.""  Though billed as something other than the churchy norm, the obvious setting of churches and pastors and pews made this an easy film for non-churchgoers to avoid.

Which is too bad, really.  This is a movie worth being watched and discussed by those inside and out of ""the fold.""

Steve Taylor's story addresses issues of racism, class, hypocricy, and spiritual arrogance--and shows that all of these things exist on both sides of the economic/religious tracks.  The story revolves around two pastors, both from similar church backgrounds, but having gone vastly different ways in their purposes and styles of ministry.  When the rising suburban ""pop star"" pastor begins to truly involve himself in the community of his urban counterpart, his motives are tested.  The relationship between the two ministers gets off to a rocky start, and, thanks to Taylor's directing, never seems too easily resolved.  Eventually, they are challenged to find reconciliation by unexpected sources.

The photography in the film is nicely done.  The acting drew me into each of the characters' lives (Carr is great, and yes, Michael W. Smith pulls off his parts with surprising ease and credibility).  The music is understated, yet fitting.  Although I would've liked to see a bit more grittiness in the gang-related scenes, I think the story captured the basics of urban life.  And those who have complaints about any brief swear words are apparently far removed from the much harsher language that goes on in such settings.

Sure, the movie has a few glitches, but it has many things to be commended.  It doesn't paint issues in black and white; instead it paints them in the very real colors of the human experience, with glimmers of Godly hope shining through it all.

**the DVD has nice extras, for those wanting a deeper look**",1153958400,17,1954,5.040498442367602
2567171,3,B000FIHNA2,"This movie was pretty good but I had a couple of problems with it.  I don't know if I could truly say this was a Christian movie because it had curses in it.  Maybe it shows how far the church has gotten away from its roots.  One of the main characters in the film is a preacher who has a problem with swearing.  I mean he even does it in the pulpit.  I know we all have our shortcomings, but I don't see how a Christian movie can have a cursing preacher because a preacher is supposed to be a trained orator.  If you have a problem with cursing - especially when you're in the pulpit, then you have no business being licensed to preach.  It may convey the message that in certain situations, using foul language and physical violence to solve problems is ok.  But the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

The cursing is not really excessive and I have seen other movies with Christian overtones such as ""The Apostle"" or ""The Fighting Temptations"" that had cursing in them and I didn't have a problem with them because that's what one would expect.  But this is supposed to be a Christian movie and should be judged by higher standards.

The other problem I had with the movie was that it had about 3 or 4 unresolved issues.  I think it should have been about a half hour longer so we could know what happened with certain characters, but that was left to our imaginations.  And right at a very important point in the movie, it just ended.  It almost seems like the producer ran out of money and didn't finish the movie but they put it out anyway.

Other than that, the movie was good.  The acting was good and it didn't have that low budget Christian movie feel to it.  It brought out some important issues concerning racism, church operations and politics, and classism that are so prevalent in today's Christian church.  I didn't look at the clock once during the movie so I guess I can say that it wasn't boring at all.

I guess this movie would be ok to show to your Christian friends at home because it does bring out some good valid points, but please, not in the sanctuary.",1153785600,6,2084,4.324742268041237
2567172,5,B000FIHNA2,"This is a very enjoyable film.  I am a Michael W. Smith fan who was able to see the film in the theatre, and I found it to be very enjoyable.  It conveyed a very important message while remaining lighthearted at moments.  It is the kind of film that leaves you thinking for days and that you would not be ashamed to see with your family!  Frankly, it seemed more like a PG than a PG-13 rating to me, and I was very relieved!  I am so tired of movies filled with filthy content.  This one was a breath of fresh air!  I am very excited about the release of the DVD.  The performances were strong.",1149033600,38,594,4.060344827586207
2567173,3,B000FIHNA2,"When you're a Christian boy, whos outlook is a little skewed friends can be pretty hard to come by. In those moments of loneliness, when the television cant fill your time. You sometimes turn to the voices that make so much sense. For me it was Michael W. Smith and Steve Taylor. Smith I discovered when I was 10. His album Go West Young Man wore out my cassette player. I knew every word and sang every song, Id even put on silly little concerts in my room. The simple lyrics touched me, encouraged me, and I also found that at Bible camp if you can learn all those Michael W. Smith songs the girls will pay attention to you. My early teens were shaped by these lyrics and forever changed my world view.

But alas we grow up, my Christian tapes were thrown into a drawer and Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana became the music I rocked out too. I really started doubting if any of this religion stuff was worth a hill of beans and then Christmas 1994 came and I opened a brightly colored package that had an unusual video in it. It was Steve Taylors concept video called ""NOW THE TRUTH CAN BE TOLD"" it introduced me to a man who was one part Lenny Bruce, One part the Clash, and three parts John the Baptist. Steve Taylor was the one man I wanted to be like, the one man whose music answered questions and convicted me. I tell you I never would have survived my teenage years without him and weve never even met.

Then I grew up I got into Christian Radio and I have had an opportunity to meet many of the stars in the genre. Ive eaten lunch with Greg Long, had Bart Millard sign a banana I sold on Ebay, and Im on hugging terms with Steven Curtis Chapman. But when I got to meet Michael W. Smith at Radio City Music Hall, all I could say over and over again was it was an honor to meet you as my knees shook. I had become a thirteen year boy again. Dont ask me about what happened when I sat five feet away from Steve Taylor at a lunch sponsored by the film Im about to review. I was stuck in some pointless icebreaker exercise and I thought it would be rude to jump up and cause a scene, also I was shaking so much I don't know what I would have said if I met him anyway. So alas I haven't gotten to talk to him yet. But one day I may be able too and that would be awesome.

All this to say I have been eagerly awaiting THE SECOND CHANCE. A film that was written and directed by Taylor and starring Smith. Imagine my two childhood heroes making a film together. It was too much for me to bear. Unfortunately my job pulled me away from the New Jersey premiere so I borrowed the DVD screener from work and watched it with my wife as the New York Metropolitan area got hit with 2 feet of snow.

THE SECOND CHANCE follows Ethan Jenkins (Michael W. Smith) a suburban pastor whose life is just getting comfortable. He had a successful recording career that ended in rehab, and has since taken the associate pastor gig at The Rock, his fathers mega-church deep in the heart of suburbia. When Ethans methods get in the way of the church boards plans he is sent to The Second Chance Community Church. Its a small inner city church Ethans father started when Ethan was a child and hes there to learn and observe. Second Chance is in the middle of the inner city and is presided over by Pastor Jake (Jeff Carr), a former pro basketball player who is trying to save his community from the plight of gangs and drugs. Its an uphill battle and he sees Ethan as just another suburban do-gooder that will leave when the going gets tough. Can these men work together? Will Ethan stick with Pastor Jake? Or will other insidious plans cause a rift in the hood?

THE SECOND CHANCE is a film with very lofty goals. Its a film that reveals one of the biggest problems that is plaguing the Christian Church in America: racial and class seperation. There is a problem with terms like ""Black Church"" and ""White Church."" and ""Rich Church"" and ""Poor Church."" Theyre false. There is only one church and we all should be invited. Ethan and Jake are two souls caught in the middle. Ethan is out of his comfort zone at Second Chance and Jake is tired of the Suburban church throwing money at his neighborhood problems and not helping out. Does the Second Chance film succeed in opening our eyes to the problems in our own backyard? It does.

Director Taylor fills his film with rich colorful characters. But at times his actors cant get into them. For instance I particularly loved the sassy women playing the choir leader. She has such a small role and yet she fills it with color and realism. Other performers just aren't as skilled and the dialogues they have sound like dialogue and not real life conversations.

As for the two leads, Smith and Carr give competent performances. Both are first time film actors and against the odds grow into their characters. There are a few moments early on that felt a little wooden but as the film progresses I bought their relationship, and them as the characters.

The major flaw with the film is the long winded first act. The script dumps a lot of plot conflict on the story and the long walk around the hood confused me a little. But then there is this scene with Smith, a small child, and a paper plate. WOW! Taylor and Smith nail it. This was a small moment in a lot of disjointed clutter that was perfect. I hoped for more honest moments like that and they definitely came. If you are a Christian and are not moved by the foot washing scene that comes later in the film Id doubt your faith (oh Im just kidding).

I also liked that the film had a good natured sense of humor. There were moments when I saw Taylors wit and good natured ribbing poking out. Trust me you won't look at prayer and a lottery ticket the same way again.

But how will this admittedly ""Christian Film"" play to the unchurched masses? I don't really know. It feels more like an exhortation to the Christian Community and I wonder how someone on the outside would be able to follow it. That is not a negative. If this film gets the Christian community to enter into a discussion about how to fix a great divide between the rich and poor, between the Black Church and the White Church, then I applaud it. But it is also a good look into what goes on inside the Christian community and may cause those who don't quite understand to ask questions and there is nothing wrong with dialogue.

THE SECOND CHANCE is not a perfect film, but it tries and it has guts. Moreover its watchable and more importantly honest. I liked it an applaud all involved. Now everyone go to Amazon.com and clean them out of Chagall Guevara CDs, this was Taylors early 90's rock band. Trust me its the greatest album ever",1146873600,91,6678,4.308917197452229

But believe it or not, The Second Chance really hits above its weight class. Smith stars as sort of a parody of himself (a glitzy Christian worship leader), which shows a self-awareness that I find endearing. There are a lot of funny moments as you see Smith's character trying to navigate his way through the 'hood and looking out of his depth. And the movie really tackles some tough issues regarding urban ministry in a way that should be eye-opening for suburban Christians, without being preachy or simplistic.",1456444800,,646,4.828828828828829

I worked at Christian music labels in Nashville. I helped start a mega church in the Chicago suburbs. I'm a songwriter turned screenwriter. I get it.

No one wanted this movie to be great more than I...

But after 15 minutes...

What character are we supposed to like? Who are we supposed to identify with? The angry racist black pastor or the rich white dudes who move through scenes like robots?

Typical Christian fare. And with all the musical talent you'd think there would be a great score...none. A song here & there in the script, but nothing underlying to help boost the drama.

2567240,5,B000FIHNA2,"Of the things I enjoy seeing (entertainment-wise) are people of extremely different backgrounds getting to know each other, even if one doesn't like the idea.
And that's what happens when a white pastor, due to his laxed personality and his church's style of worship, gets challenged by his ailing father to hang out with an inner-city pastor who has an edge to his style and personality (and gets tempered-down by his wife to help keep him cool). Pastor Ethan (of The Second Chance Church's central church branch) isn't easy to get along with, whatwith his clicheing mind and how he thinks Pastor Jake handles the ruffians of his neighborhood. And by ruffians, I mean the drug dealers who deal out drugs in broad daylight in front of kids, with kids, and show blatant disrespect to anyone who shows they can handle their own against them. What they don't expect is the pastor that can take them down, especially when he reveals that he, too, has a past.
There are a few people who hate this movie and say it's not a ""Christian"" movie, and the producers said they didn't want to label it as such. Why? Nothing about the language (compared to Hollywood, this is rather tame), but because it doesn't deal with conversions (like most Christians seem to expect) or an apocalyptic film (that seems cliched to do, but they do still do it), but because it deals with redemption with people from different backgrounds.
For an independently made (and small-budgeted) film, this does pretty good compared to other indie flicks I've seen (and wish I hadn't), especially in the Christian realm. As such, the acting is good (especially with Jeff Carr's attitude), the camera style subliminal in its presentation, the humor (though somewhat sparse) is refreshing when it's needed. The poignancy shows real-life grit without delving into R-rated junk (always appreciated). It's too bad there are Christians who miss the needed message for what they perceive as an ""unChristian"" ""Hollywood"" flick.
This movie is primarily about getting a second chance in life when everyone around you won't bother giving you one.

2567263,5,B000FIHNA2,"I have a few beefs with this movie, including one somewhat notable one. But before I get to them, let's start with what's great about this movie, and top of the list is its overall message.

Through a story that melds a black inner-city pastor with his church together with a white pastor from a ""rich suburban"" church, this is a very challenging movie for The Church as a whole in America, that probably would (and probably should) make much of the American Church feel very uncomfortable. This movie hits close to home, folks, and will really get you to thinking about how much of our Christianity is a ""show"" vs. how much is really loving and caring for others. This movie showcases some of this stuff in very poignant ways and you might be surprised just how revealing it is, both of the Church as a whole, and of yourself - it might just hit you between the eyes (it did to me). It's so easy to just want to throw money on a problem so you don't have to ""get personally involved"" - but there's a big difference between handing out money and committing yourself to service - to really living out the servant life of love that we are called to as Christians. That is the core of what this movie is about, which it tells in an engaging and interesting story.

The acting and production quality are great and much better than I expected. I admit to initially being a tad concerned when I saw that Michael W. Smith was playing a lead because in my mind I thought that no matter how great a musician he is, his inclusion as a lead probably was going to mean some pretty cheesy acting. I was definitely wrong - he carried himself just fine, as did the rest of the cast. The story was perfectly believable (which while good of course, given the subject matter, is also sad) and it was clearly well-directed.

Now to the concerns: This is a gritty movie that is not what typically would spring to mind if you think ""Christian movie"" - it has some bad language and a bit of violence. It is PG-13 for a reason. The language itself didn't grandly bother me (it's not horrible - many PG movies have just as bad) and it is within the context of the inner-city life, but what DID really bother me was that one of the characters doing the cussing was the inner-city black pastor who in many ways the film builds up as someone to look up to. I really see absolutely no movie benefit at all to them having the ""man of God"" doing cussing (and noted in the movie itself as having a cussing problem), but rather I see it as a strong negative. I know that some pastors cuss, etc. in real-life, but I don't need to see someone on screen that we're supposed to be looking up to (and is busy delivering many of the thoughtful punchlines of the movie) portrayed this way - I see no benefit to that at all. It just muddies (and muddles) things in a way that isn't good. With that said, the problematic language by the pastor or otherwise was relatively little all things considered. I tend to be pretty sensitive these days to bad language, but this movie didn't leave me feeling dirty in that regards, etc.

My other concern with this movie simply stems from the ending and lack of real resolution. Part of me thinks they did this on purpose to kind of leave the viewer with the feeling that ""and on and on this goes""...But what might have been nice artistically or philosophically, wasn't satisfying as a MOVIE ending. Without giving the ending away, although it strongly hints at things turning out well on a couple of different fronts, you don't get to really see it. It's just that nothing gets fully resolved. You don't see the suburban church board changing their mind (and hearts), and you don't feel an emotional resolution with the characters you've been invested in for 2 hours, and thus, as mentioned, you kind of are left feeling ""and on and on everything goes"". It's not a horrible ending (I've seen worse) but it just isn't how you really WANT to see it on screen. Then again, life, much like this movie, doesn't always work out how we'd like to see. Sometimes what might be best from an artistic perspective just isn't what your emotions really want to see (feel) happen.

Those two issues aside (cussing pastor and lack of satisfying resolution), this is still a worthwhile movie that you will likely be highly glad you watched, if for no other reason than the great messages it showcases in such clear terms. It is largely because of the messages, combined with high production value, that I've rated this as high as I have despite its flaws.

2567278,4,B000FIHNA2,"A lot of people have criticized this movie because of a few curse words and anger shown by one of the main characters, a pastor in an inner city church.  Who said the pastor was supposed to be the role model in this movie?  If you pay attention you will see that this movie shows that sometimes God uses the weak, the lowly, the ""dumb"" people to be examples of how we should live as Christians.  The character ""Sonny"" lead the two main characters in doing what is right in the foot washing scene.  And the movie is portraying reality, and showing the faults of human beings in a way that makes it obvious what the RIGHT thing is, and in the end they put aside their anger and come together to try to make a difference in the community.

In the past I would have thought it is a shame for a Christian to utter profanity, and how could it be called a ""Christian"" film with so much bad language?!  But now over the past few years I've learned a lot about how God looks at us when we are His children, and how He wants us to treat each other (even when we sin), and it's NOT the way the Pharisees acted. Someone recently put on facebook a picture of a judge's gavel with this statement:  ""Don't judge others just because they sin differently than you do.""  All bad habits are hard to break, whether it is cursing, drinking, smoking, lying, cheating, stealing, OR eating a lot of junk food or sweets, watching too much TV instead of reading your Bible, spending too much time on the phone or texting or facebooking or whatever, OR THINKING insults about someone who you don't like, or lust or hate, etc.  The fact that the black pastor's old habits came back occasionally when he was in a very stressful situation shows that he was a real person, he had a real bad past, and just like ALL of us he was still flesh and blood even though he had been saved.  If a Christian gets upset when their kid does something really bad and they yell at their kid and lose their temper, is that right?  No, it's wrong.  It's sin.  But if you are truly God's child then it's under the blood just like all your other sins, and if you say a curse word while you're at it, that is under the blood as well.  (FYI I have never cursed - it's not my personal problem - I have plenty others though, and they are all under the blood and I'm changing by His power...) One reason so many people can't stand to watch ""Christian"" movies is because they are so fake, so white-washed, so CHEESY.  In this movie the characters act like real people and the message is clear without being preachy.

I would have given it 5 stars but the end was a bit of a cliff hanger.  I guess we are to assume the best, and if so, then it had a good ending.",1349568000,,2705,4.191119691119691

I found this story uncompelling- it meandered for the first 40 minutes with nothing particularly interesting going on.  Neither of the lead characters were all that memorable or endearing- the characters seemed 2 dimensional and flat, especially M. Smith's character.  They weren't unlikable exactly, but they hardly had me rooting for them (partially due to the clumsy story- who knows what to even ""root"" for).  The acting was of higher quality than some other films I loved (like Facing the Giants- amazing film, but not the very best acting ever), and it had excellent production quality, but the story just utterly failed to hit the right notes in the right places.  The subplot of the young man leaving his brother's gang could have had so much more impact than it did, and other elements that I thought were subplots while watching the movie (paper-plate kid's family issues, for example) were never resolved, and as another review mentioned, the ending was abrupt, flat, and wholly unsatisfying.  This film's heart is in the right place, but the execution of the idea/story was simply clumsy and ineffective.  I have a vague sense that I might know what the writer was aiming for, but it is vague, and just a guess.  I won't tell anyone they ought not see the film, most folks seem to love it. I did not find anything blasphemous or disturbing in the film's content, as other negative reviewers have.  Is there some bad language/behavior?  Yep.  Didn't bother me.  For one, the film is hardly advocating the negative behaviors present in the film, they simply exist in it, as they do in the lives of a great many people.  If you have a very hard time with violence (which was pretty mild compared to popular movie standards), or bad language, either prepare yourself for it so you don't get shocked, or grab a Disney flick instead.  :-)",1316217600,,2044,4.72112676056338

This is where, a church gets so established that the systems are put into place and everything becomes mechanised. At this point a ministry loses its soul, and its passion.

This is the heart of the Laodicean Church (Revelation 3:14-19). They had everything in the natural, but in the spiritual they were really blind, poor and naked. The main church of the founders get the shock of their lives when they are reproached by their minister from the poor and struggling sister church.

As a result, Ethan (Michael W. Smith) is sent out from the comfort of his wealthy congregation that was established by his father and is assigned to the church that is in the poor side of town.

What is enlightning is how he comes to terms with druggies, drug mules, pushers and prostitues. These are the new challenges that he faces. This movie is quite entertaining.

Well to be honest, no, this was not an uplifting movie, but it wasn't intended to be.  It was an in your face realization that we don't do enough in the way of homeless, drug abuse, and at risk youth in our communities.  The main point of this movie is to become doers of the Word and not just listeners.  Get involved with local charities or homeless shelters.  Rolling down the window and giving spare change or a dollar is good, but it doesn't have a lasting impact on you.  This movie shows what happens when you get involved.
I believe this movie held up it's Christian values.  The church was open to anyone that wanted to change.  From hookers to gang members, the church did not turn their back.
In a example of Christ, a boy that wanted out of a gang had to have a ritual beating.  But it as a friend that step in and took that beating for him.  He was put in the hospital the beating was so bad, but he did it out of love.

Ethan faces culture shock as he discovers what life is like in a neighborhood where drugs and violence are everywhere.  Gradually his values begin to change as he sees what life is like for those who live near the Second Chance Church.

The concept of the movie is a good one, but somehow the idea suffers from poor pacing and script writing.  Jake and Ethan are at odds all the way through the movie, so their reconciliation in the end seems forced and phony.  Jake's character is unnecessarily harsh and the movie doesn't really show him connecting with his congregation.

2567387,5,B000FIHNA2,"I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie that I had heard nothing about. I was walking in BlockBuster looking for a movie to rent one day, and saw the title and read the movie info on the DVD jacket, and gave it a try.  And I'm glad I did.

Why? Because all too often, we pretend that racial and class issues do not exist in the Church.  We don't discuss it. We act as if it doesn't exist.  We pretend that Christian people have no issues or problems, no besetting sins or struggles.  But that is not reality.  What I liked so much about this movie is that it attempted to show the reality of Christians and how they can sometimes act against the very Gospel they are supposed to be fighting for.

Since many reviewers have already done an excellent job of giving many details of the movie, I will simply point out some of the highlights and uplifting moments.

But I have to first say that I am surprised at some of the negative reviews, which seem to me to be written by people who, as Jesus said, ""strain out a gnat and swallow a camel"" (Matthew 23:24).  Ok, so the movie has some cussing in it.  I didn't like that either, but that should NOT be used to argue that this is not a ""Christian movie"" or that it should not be watched.  I actually counted the cussing in the movie.  And I challenge anyone to compare what I've found to any other ""Hollywood"" movie.  What did I find?  There were 8 instances of foul language throughout the whole over 2 hour movie - EIGHT.

When was the last time you saw a Hollywood major motion picture (besides a G rated) that had only 8 cuss words?  And even some of those can be considered questionable, as all of them can be found in some of our Bible translations. People are too busy straining out a gnat, and swallowing a camel.

What Jesus meant by that saying is that people made too much of minor things, but overlooked the bigger and more important issues.  The central message of forgiveness and racial reconciliation that runs through this movie should not be overlooked for 8 cuss words used to show the reality of how SOME people do talk in the real world (yes, some pastors DO cuss, even though they should not...I've heard it myself).

Two scenes were incredibly funny.  One was when pastor Jake was feeding the homeless and talking to the media about how the mayor was kissing the butts of ""self-serving corporations.""  He was about to cuss, but his wife Amanda interjects with ""as far as crime and unemployment are concerned..."" You'll get it better when you see it.  It's hilarious!  Then, pastor Jake is sitting up on his bed with his wife watching TV, when he sees ""The Rock"" church commercial and gets upset that he was put in it.  He is about to cuss again, when his wife pops him with a loving elbow in the chest before he does.  Now that was classic and comedic.  Sometimes a pastor's wife has more sense than the pastors themselves, and that too reflects a reality in the real world of the Church.

One of the most powerful and uplifting scenes in this movie, despite one reviewer's crazy claim that nothing ""uplifting"" was in the movie, was when ""Sunny"" asked Tony for forgiveness (a clearly Gospel concept) for being more concerned about Tony using the word ""hell"" than how he was feeling after taking a gang beating to get a friend out of a gang.  Self-sacrifice for another IS uplifting and a Christian concept.

""Sunny,"" in the church devotional time, proceeds to wash Tony's feet while asking for forgiveness.  That action comes right out of the Bible.  And as Jake (the black, antagonistic pastor) sees this, he gets convicted for how he treated Ethan, and then goes to the front of the church to pick up the pail and towel to wash Ethan's feet (the white pastor), and both meet together at the front.  Then, Ethan proceeds to wash Jake's feet first, showing repentance and forgiveness for both of them.  This was the most powerful and uplifting scene in the whole movie, and it brought tears to my eyes.

Forgiveness and redemption are uplifting concepts that are at the heart of the Gospel message.  So I simply don't get what some people are thinking, and I wonder if they didn't watch a totally different movie (a bootleg movie with the same title? LOL).

I have to admit that at first pastor Jake's actions and words were disturbing. He's a pastor who uses some questionable foul language at times, BUT he also feeds the homeless regularly, helps men prepare for job interviews, assists his wife in helping women leave prostitution, helps young boys leave gangs and drugs, and helped support a poor  African family that barely escaped execution while fleeing their country.  Like most real pastors, he had his good and bad qualities.  It was refreshing to see both sides in this movie because it reflects reality.  But what was even better to see was his change at the end, along with Ethan's, as they reconcile their differences.

Most impressive was when Ethan decided to leave the comforts of his suburban church to live in pastor Jake's area and minister with him in his church with his wife.  We need more ""changes"" like that in the real world.

The overall message of this movie is thoroughly Christian, and I wish it had gotten more ""press"" and exposure, as this message needs to get out to more people in the church.  We need to address the issues that the movie touches on, the issues of race, discrimination, class, and emotional grudges in ministry that cause problems for the body of Christ.  WE need to deal with these things and not pretend they don't exist.  This powerful little movie CAN help us do just that.  Great job Michael W. Smith and company!  We need more films like this!",1198886400,3,5688,4.5195694716242665

The movie's message is essentially being a Christian is more than just showing up on Sunday and tossing money in the plate.  This movie dares to ask you what are you doing for others? Are you serving the truly needy in your community?  It was extremely convicting and I applaud the fact that a small amount of profanity to show the world is not all bright lights and people in ties.  It challenges white, middle class, mega church evangelicals, of which I am one.. to get up and do something.

As for the plot and acting.. I will say there were some holes in the plot and not enough build on why a person would change their actions.  Some will be angry there is not a ""come to Jesus"" moment or a challenge to the audience to accept Christ.  I did feel there was a potential for a HUGE moment where one pastor ""buys"" the life of another, but the movie never seems to build on the moment.

Overall, I found this more of a journey and a challenge as to what happens when my check hits the offering plate and makes it to the street.",1198454400,,1217,4.349557522123894
2567389,3,B000FIHNA2,"I only bought this movie because I got it at a bargain price.  Much to my surprise, I really liked it.  I do object to the profanity in it; mild by today's standards, but then again, Christians are not to follow ""today's"" standards but God's; the Bible, not ""realism""-- Especially pastors.  I hope this does not become a trend in Christian films.  Also, I would have liked a gospel presentation of some sort to have been worked into the film.

 That said, I do think the film was well acted and had a good message; even MWS was believable. MWS plays a white yuppie preacher's kid who goes to an inner city black church  ""to observe"". Both the black pastor and the white yuppie have stereotyped notions about each other and race relations within the church.  These barriers eventually break down somewhat and both come to a better understanding of ""the other side"".  The white yuppie learns that money is not always enough and the black pastor realized that not all whites are the enemy.  A related subplot is mega church's emphasis on money over people--how far do we go?

I am very disappointed to see that.  How will we ever get word to Hollywood or any other movie producing entity that profanity is not necessary to make a good movie if Christian movies use the same language?

2567407,3,B000FIHNA2,"In execution this movie tries in turns to be edgy (gang turf issues! Prostitutes needing help!) and hip (Michael W Smith sings!) but the underlying message is actually quite low key, as is the acting.
Michael W Smith plays the son of a highly successful pastor, being groomed to take over a large affluent church, with its large international outreach program.  He helps the pastor of their sister church, called Second Chance, which is where his father started - it is in the slums, with outreaches to the poor and needy, the prostitutes and gang victims.  He is admonished for giving the pastor of the poor church a chance to speak his mind on live television, and as discipline, is sent to the Second Chance church for a time, to observe and report.  Naturally, in doing so, he starts to gain a realization of his distance from real life and genuine outreach, and becomes a better person..
Some of the efforts at getting a message across are a bit clumsy - Michael Smith has his fancy BMW damaged and trades it in for a small cheap car and is happier as a result.  However, some of the underlying themes of where church politics can lead are prescient and worth raising.  Should affluent churches from wealthy neighbourhoods really invest so heavily in African outreach, when poverty and destitution are creating huge problems on their doorstep?
In answering these questions, the movie comes across a little one sided and heavy handed, but the point is well made, if lacking punch in the finale.
A worthy effort and well shot and acted.  Michael W Smith won't win any Oscars and still looks happiest when singing rather than acting, but the end result is well worth a view, and good family entertainment. In fact, it occurs to me, that with the interesting milieu of characters, this would have made a better TV series!",1185062400,2,1822,4.695924764890282

2567414,4,B000FIHNA2,"The Second Chance is a drama about the Church and about playing Church.  Though there is a unifying reconciliation theme running through the movie, it is largely character-driven with an assortment of characters with different personal issues that makes for a multi-faceted storyline that is paradoxically very intimate, as it addresses individuals, yet also very big-picture, as it raises questions about how to deal with local and global societal challenges, the role of money and power in society and the Church, and how best to love God by loving man.

Plot:  Comfy suburban White megachurch meets in-the-trenches urban community Black church, and drama happens.  Michael W. Smith stars as Ethan (""Gucci"") the White associate pastor forced by his church board to ""do time"" observing and learning from experience with the Black church's Pastor Jake, convincingly played by jeff obafemi carr.  With light humor, the movie focuses on the personal and relational transformations of Gucci and Jake as they meet such PG-13 urban challenges as poverty, stereotypes, addictions, physical abuse, gangs, and drugs.

The situations depicted ring true, and I could relate every character and situation from this movie to personal experience.  Though the life struggles addressed are fairly common knowledge, such unpleasant realities are often blocked out or tucked away, and this film is a reminder to stay on spiritual track, remembering one's first love and to  serve even as Jesus came to serve.  The scene that impacted me the most, and which probably will stay with me, involves a youth pastor caring for one of his sheep to the uttermost.  It made me want to reach out and love someone.",1168905600,3,1685,5.18450184501845

One reviewer complained about the profanity.  I agree with another reviewer that it fit the character and what might really happen.  There is a realism in this movie that a lot of Christian movies miss.

One thing that this movie does well:  It silently argues for racial reconciliation.  The protagonists are of different races, and so are the antagonists.  The focus is putting your faith into action.

This is not a family movie, but very suitable for a group of teenagers, especially shown with a time given for discussion afterwards.  Actually, I would recommend it being shown to a group of adults with said discussion following.

One final treat is the closing song, co-written by Steve Taylor and Michael W. Smith.  I have been a fan of both separately, and this collaboration brings out the best of both artists.",1164499200,9,1039,4.556756756756757
2567427,5,B000FIHNA2,"Steve Taylor and Michael W. Smith usually would bring to mind music of the 80's.  But they've both developed and kept their careers going and it was neat to see that they collaborated on a movie.

First off, my expectations are not high when I view a Christian movie.  Simply because they are usually low budget and preachy.  After seeing this one, I'd say they have raised the bar on quality.

The message was simple yet very challenging.  Though the plot was predictable, there was a lot of events and a few twists to keep you watching.  At the end, it made me wish that our church could be involved in something like what they did.  I did cringe when the pastor swore in the pulpit because I wasn't expecting it in a ""Christian"" movie.  But it was true to his character and it showed how Christians are more realistically.

I hope that this movie is the start of something new.  Steve Taylor did an excellent job as a newer director and Smitty did a fine job in acting.  I look forward to seeing Taylor's next movie efforts!",1162080000,4,1027,4.404255319148936
2567428,4,B000FIHNA2,"Let me get this out of the way: I do not automatically give all Christian movies 5 stars merely to ""give them support."" As the leader of my church's drama ministry I believe we are responsible to pursue and promote excellence in the arts. Poor craftsmanship implies poor effort and lacks credibility. Trust me, the makers of this film feel the same way.

When I saw this was a film by Steve Taylor, I knew I had to see this movie.

When I heard Michael W. Smith was in the lead role, I wasn't so sure I wanted to see this movie.

Well, I was pleased with much of it, challenged as a Christian by parts of it, and disappointed with lots of it. As with his cutting edge music, Taylor pushed some buttons that definitely needed to be pushed (punched and smashed, too) about the marketing mentality within the church, the social laziness we ignore, the racial ignorance we tolerate (on both sides), and the flawless facade we try to project. As for the occasional swearing the pastor does, that's just real life. Preachers are fallible.

As for Smitty, all I can say is, ""He obviously worked very hard on this and there were times when he was very effective."" That's nicer than saying, ""Don't quit your day job."" And more honest, really. He truly didn't stink at it. But I doubt he'll ever be on Martin Scorsese's speed dial.

jeff obafemi carr (the lowercase thing is his idea) is pretty darn good, though. Hope to see him again.

The great, glaring weakness of 'Second Chance' is in the retreaded plots: Plot A: A small, faithful inner city church is financially strapped and the administrative board plans to shut it down if its fortunes don't turn around, so the congregation rallies to save it. Plot B: A rebellious, successful son is resistant about taking over the reins of a church from his kindly old father, the senior pastor who is beloved by everyone. Heard either of those plots before? Sure, in just about every story about a church that you've ever seen from 'The Preacher's Wife', 'Sister Act,' and 'The Gospel' to dozens of episodes of 'Highway to Heaven' and 'Touched by An Angel' to half of the Christian novels ever written. Is there no other story out there?

 I really feel Taylor missed an opportunity by not trying for a more original story to tell, one that the average person could identify with. And hadn't seen before. But this is still a good first effort by Steve.",1160524800,4,2390,4.554778554778554

Crash, the movie that took a lot of Oscars this year, was a good movie, not a great movie, but a good movie. This movie, The Second Chance, was about the same subject, but was actually worthy of an Academy Award. Will it get it? Of course not. People can't see past their prejudices against the Christian religion to see this excellent movie for what it is; a much better depiction of bigotry in our society today, in the secular world but more sorrowfully, in the churches. I have also watched a lot of Christian movies, and while I try to be patient and give them a fair chance, this one stood alone as a movie I would put up against the likes of Crash or any other movie Hollywood puts out.

2567432,4,B000FIHNA2,"""The Second Chance"" tells the story of two men who share the same faith, and live in the same city, but are from completely different worlds. One is a celebrity figure who works as music director at the biggest church in town; the other is a street-smart preacher who was once in prison, and now works to prevent the kids from his part of town from going down the same path he took. Through a twist of fate, both men are forced to work together. Together, they each come to respect one another, even as outside forces work against them.

This is a fine Christian drama that shows how people who come from different backgrounds can get along when they realize they share one thing in common: the same faith. Michael W. Smith, in his feature film debut, and Jeff Obafemi Carr gives a fine performances. The supporting cast does an equally-impressive job in their respective roles.

The film does tend to drag a bit at times, but the performances, as well as some very moving scenes and fantastic music numbers, manage to make up for the slower moments in the film. I would recommend this film to fans of both Smith and Carr, and also to fans of good, dramatic films. You're sure to enjoy it.

2567434,4,B000FIHNA2,"I watched this film with pretty low initial expectations... hoping that this so-calleld ""Christian"" movie would finally break the ""Christian movie"" stereotype I had come to... well... loathe and expect. With Steve Taylor at the helm... I thought, ""Maybe. Just maybe...""

Truthfully -- it exceeded all my expectations. Smartly written, smartly directed, and even well-acted... for the most part.

(I shouldn't even label it as a good ""Christian"" movie. It's just a good movie. Period. I think a lot of people will enjoy this film.)

Michale W. Smith does a pretty good job playing the talented music minister, Ethan Jenkins -- the son and successor-to-be of the successful Pastor Jeremiah Jenkins, senior pastor of The Rock (Mega)Church and founding pastor of the inner city church, The Second Chance.

Smith plays an interesting character.  While his own road to success may have been paved by that of his father, he wants to do the right thing and has a good heart. A bit naive, perhaps, in his view of life and ministry, he is greatly affected by what he sees and experiences at The Second Chance Church when he is sent there by a miffed church board as ""punishment"" for being a little to loose with the church's live television broadcasts.

Jeff Carr is very charming and convincing as the passionate - ""in your face"" - and somewhat jaded-by-reality Pastor Jake Sanders. He believes strongly in the ministry of the Second Chance Church in his community -- but he's allowed his anger and his temper to cloud some of his decisions and judgment. (Sanders' tongue is actually what gets Ethan Jenkins in trouble when Jenkins gives him some air-time on the The Rock's live televised program -- ""Well, then... you can just keep your damn money!"")

Jenkins and Sanders are then forced to work together. Sanders' inner-city method of ""ministry"" is sometimes more than wide-eyed, open-mouthed Jenkins can swallow... (When Sander slams a drug-pushing gang-member up against the fence and threatens to break his arm if the gangster doesn't let his little brother ""out"" of the family business... well, Jenkins hardly knows what to do with himself.)

Both Jenkins and Sanders go through some pretty significant yet believable changes as they learn from each other -- perhaps Jenkins moreso from Sanders. And even Ethan's father, Pastor Jeremiah Jenkins, has to face the reality that even though his ministry at The Rock has gone global, he has forgotten where it all started... leading the movie's climax to a heartfelt and satisfying ""conclusion.""

Pick it up. It's a good flick.",1156896000,110,2569,4.9976580796252925
2567435,4,B000FIHNA2,"Movies with a Christian worldview are, for the most part, fairly preachy. As a result, most people who aren't Christians avoid these movies, leaving the films solely ""preaching to the choir."" To the contrary, ""The Second Chance"" is a groundbreaking film in that it leaves the salvation message alone and instead tackles the role that Christians and the Church should take in our communities.

Rather than re-hash the plot and characters, which have been covered amply in many other Amazon reviews, I'd rather examine the strengths and weaknesses in ""The Second Chance."" Fortunately, there are far more strengths than weaknesses, despite a first-time director (Steve Taylor) and star (Michael W. Smith).

On the plus side, the flow of the action and the plot are well above average. Instead of covering the typical Christian ground of salvation or the Second Coming, this film delves into an American inner-city, complete with gangs and opportunist politicians. The characterizations are gritty, and the dialogue is real. ""The Second Chance"" is also about the right length, so viewers won't have much of a chance to get bored.

On the other hand, some of the acting is a little wooden, especially some of the members of Pastor Jake's congregation. Michael W. Smith also takes a little while during the film to settle into his role, though his performance is largely believable.

Using a balance scale, ""The Second Chance"" is more than satisfying. It provokes viewers to compare themselves with the people they see in the movie and ask themselves what they would do in those situations. Movie viewers may tend to avoid most Christian films, but that would be a mistake in this case. I highly recommend ""The Second Chance"" as worthy of at least one viewing, and possibly as an addition to your collection.",1156291200,,1802,5.016722408026756

I'm actually really upset by the 1 star-raters here who can't see past the fact that the two pastors are, you know, imperfect. One is complacent and naive, the other is bitter and angry, the two don't trust each other, and there's some swearing. Maybe we should shut the Bible too, its pages are filled with sinners: Samson blew off his parents and broke all his Nazarene vows, David murdered his friend to have an affair with Bathsheba, Peter and Paul argued, Abraham lied about Sarah being his sister (twice), Solomon followed the gods of his hundreds of wives... I can keep going.

Look, the church is a family: We disagree, it gets messy, but ultimately we work it out and sharpen each other. Jesus never had a problem with messy people; he had a problem with people who thought they had it all together. The ones who were more concerned about the rules than the people. If you think Christianity is about embodying some kind of pseudo-perfection, you may be reading the Bible through a Pharisaical lens. The characters in this movie portray very real struggles: If you knew people like this, would you condemn them? Or tell them to sweep their honest feelings under the rug and put on a show of happiness in the name of Christianity? Don't take God's name in vain like that. Being honest means confronting our darkness with the support of our church family, not ignoring it.

We're here to love people, and our flaws are going to get in the way of that. But we'll grow if we don't give up on each other. That's what this movie is about.",1472774400,,1746,4.607717041800643
