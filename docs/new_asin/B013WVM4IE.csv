7374413,5,B013WVM4IE,"Love this movie.  The story and imagery entertain and challenge the viewer.  We're all aware of the current focus on young adults in the vampire genre but it took Ivan Noel to create a beautiful and thought-provoking movie based on child vampires.

Do you think Mr Noel is a bit weird for investing his time and energy in such a strange film?  Well, consider the Catholic mass:  I caught one today (Sunday) on TV and was struck by the imagery of adults eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ while two attractive young boys framed much of the video.  Ivan's chosen imagery may be disturbing but it can force the viewer to look deep within his/her soul to explore good vrs evil.

In other words, this is not a movie to watch passively.  Enjoy whatever titillation or entertainment you  may be looking for initially but open you mind and let  the challenging story and imagery  stimulate a personal explorations into good and evil, life and death and the nature of children.",1443916800,14,982,4.618497109826589

7374422,5,B013WVM4IE,"Spanish with English subtitles.  What a delightful sleeper. A reporter ( Sabrina Ramos, as Alicia ) receives an email invitation by a Nun ( And Maria Giunta as Erda )to do a story at her Orphanage, ""Limbo"".  A country orphanage where children are dying of a ""so called"" mysterious, incurable disease.  Alicia is told that the disease cause a ""photosensitivity"" in the children.  A symptom that is suppose to explain why the children sleep all day and are only awake and playing during the day. Little by little Alicia begins to feel that she recognizes many of the children's faces.  She is also surprised by the fact that one of the children and the Nun know very personal things about her past.  Especially one of the young boys,  who seems quite smitten by her.

The story line is in some way familiar.  Kids vs. adults,  the strong targeting the weak, but it goes deeper than that. Hence the paranormal / horror part of the storyline.  There are some good twists. Some predictability.  But a good watch.  It is not a N. American movie, so of course, sexuality and children  is handled differently than in the US.  It doesn't really cross any boundaries.  But the issue comes up.  But not in the way one would think.  It comes up very naturally given the circumstances and is handled very well. IMO.  But this is an adult movie.

This movie was filmed in Argentina.  They definitely have some beautiful children in that country, because there were some strikingly beautiful babies in this cast.  And very good actors.  Sabrina Ramos did a wonderful job as the ""straight to business"" reporter, as did the comedic and expressive Maria Giunta.  Young actors Toto Muoz did an amazing job playing an old soul in a young body.  And the enchanting, cat eyed Lauro Veron played his role well also.  I say this movie is worth reading the subtitles.  It's a good watch.",1478908800,3,1862,4.649230769230769

He wanted to push the boundaries of childish innocence vs old souls cynicism but never went full throttle on it.

7374443,5,B013WVM4IE,"The producer Ivan Noel with the leading lady actor Ana Maria Giunta with great talent developed a fictional movie that contains vast imagery and locations about the legends of vampires.  Usually, Vampire movies are about young adults inter alia.  But this movie goes south of the border, and utilizes legends found in that culture, centered on young children who graduate from a boy and girl to teenagers starting puberty by rites of baptism and graduation of that local legends.  It is remarkable how Ivan Noel and his production staff recruited hundreds of youngsters as extras.  Most noteworthy was how Ivan Noel took such young actors and enabled them to have the posture of an adult but still the appeal of a young boy or girl - such as 10 year old Lauro Veron as a vampire prince (90 years old), Gregorio Munoz as a vampire leader and protector (37 years old, or Valentina as a girl who was a woman-protagonist.  A strange religious ex-nurse is caretaker of children in Limbo - a former convent for nuns; she keeps the vampire children safe at night and hidden during the day.  The caretaker has to be a hemophiliac, and she recruiting another to take her place.  But a band of men in a cult plot to kill them because the band of vampires at Limbo is led by the 90-year-old Grandson of Count Dracula!  This is an excellent fiction foreign movie in which the viewer can learn a great deal about life, myth, folklore and legend in another culture provided by their own citizens - a five star rated movie!",1470787200,,1508,4.600746268656716

7374445,5,B013WVM4IE,"This is a rather tense, thought-provoking drama or thriller, rather than a horror-chiller. It is certainly a new take on vampires, as well as on the missing child genre. It is well-acted, as well as well written and directed, but you expect that of Ivan Noel. As with his earlier work, Brecha (Gap), Noel treats the subject matter-of-factly, and paces the story out, which leaches out the emotion and leaves you with an almost analytical commentary on the characters, and on society. In so doing, Noel forces us to question our own definitions of evil. I can't help thinking that this film is a metaphor for the way in which society treats its most vulnerable, and then deals with their reactions.",1462060800,2,697,4.768595041322314

7374447,5,B013WVM4IE,"There are always at least two stories to an Ivan Noel film. Of course there is the film's story (along with its numerous back-stories).  Then there is the ""making of"" story, which is much more than the featurette--it also comes out in the director's commentary. While that might be said of most movies, for Noel's films, the ""making of"" is easily the most intriguing of the stories, especially in this movie.

Unfortunately, the distributor packaged and retitled it to try to appeal to a wider, baser audience.  Try to find noelfilms original art to get a better idea of the film.

For a low-budget film, there is no skimping on the location.  I suspect that travel and location expenses were almost his entire budget.

This movie turns a number of popular conceptions upside down.  It certainly gives new meaning to the term ""Child Predator"". While most vampire movies tend to portray vampires as a parody of religion, this one shows religion as a parody of vampires. I took my mother to a spanish-language mass last xmas, presided over by a vatican-trained priest, who genuinely believes that the wine and cracker turns into the blood and body of christ. So I was amused by the star's reference to this rite.

There are a few easter eggs hidden in scenes that are on the screen for a fraction of a second.  I won't spoil these by giving any more detail.

It's a fun movie, but with many layers.  Any aversion one might have to showing children being harmed, is offset by showing how much fun that have making the movie.

I hope he someday makes a director's cut, or at least posts the out-takes somewhere.",1460332800,3,1607,4.639575971731449

7374453,4,B013WVM4IE,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Children in horror movies always make the tension in such films more palpable, and therefore more fun.  Its one thing to consider horrific acts happening to adultsbut its even more reprehensible to think of those things happening to children.  But what about films where the kids are the ones committing these atrocities?  Filmmaker Ivan Noel asked that very question, and thus, CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT was born.  This haunting and inventive film is not perfect, but its a lot of fun and certainly worthy of your attention.

When I heard this was a darkly funny film, I was curious to see how deep the comedic elements might go.  After all, horror comedies are big right now, and I can see how this concept could make a fun and funny film.  Interestingly, though, the film is more of a dramatic piece with some hints of both humor and horror.

CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT is shot pretty well, although the camera used looks like it might be a cheaper one.  The film quality is decent overall, but the darker scenes look grainier than I would have preferred.  The set locations are nice, particularly the areas around the orphanage.

The acting is pretty good, too.  Sabrina Ramos does a great job as the reporter, Alicia.  Likewise, Ana Maria Giunta does a fine job in her final role before her death as Erda, the childrens overseer.  The rest of the cast supports the main characters well enough, however there are no real standout performances.

The special effects in CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT look great.  The blood looks real, and even the vampire teeth are believable.  Surprisingly, the carnage is minimalistic, and yet effective.  Most vampire films rely on a certain degree of gore to help maintain the intensity of the storyline.  This film, on the other hand, shows a small bit but relies more on the story itself.  I don't consider this a negative at all; quite the contrary, in factits refreshing to see a film that can entertain without a lot of visuals.

And speaking of the story, it is a welcome and interesting addition to the vampire genre.  I am truly impressed with its originality, as its focus on the children is something Ive rarely seen in this genre of horror.  My sole complaint is that I would have liked a bit more fleshing out of the characters, particularly Siegfried.

But with that aside, I still consider CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT a win, and I recommend it to anyone looking for lighthearted horror.  The movie feels like a cross between Shakespeares A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM and an older Hammer Dracula film, and that makes it worthy to watch on many levels.  Be prepared to read subtitles, thoughthe film lacks an English dubover.  CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT is available now in a variety of formats.",1447113600,7,2788,4.681069958847736
