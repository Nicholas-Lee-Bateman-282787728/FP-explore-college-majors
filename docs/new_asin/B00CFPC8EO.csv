5721718,5,B00CFPC8EO,"This must see movie sneaks up on you and challenges the definition of a ""genre."" Romance? Drama? Horror? Better...all of the above. It's visceral hard hitting nature will sneak up on you on different levels. Christopher Denham plays a layered character with a haunting past that has everything to do with his dealings in the present. Is he the hero or the villain of the piece? Stalker or lonely-heart shlub? That depend on the individual viewer. Each of the female characters builds upon his complex and ever-troubling dealings with the fair sex. This is one of those rare treat movies that asks all the questions with open-ended, yet resolute, answers. It's rare to find a movie like this that allows the audience to discuss and debate the film and what it really means. A great effort from first time director, Nate Taylor, and writer Peter Moore Smith.",1370217600,6,856,4.829931972789115

5721736,4,B00CFPC8EO,"A surprise, this Forgetting the Girl movie. A lot of this movie is narration; and someone who likes immediate gratification may not be patient enough to explore this movie.

This actor... I can never remember his name, but he's brilliant.  And he is especially so in this movie. Outside of The Waltons, I can't remember when I was this transfixed by voice overs. This well spoken, intelligent, fairly charming lonely, lonely, needy guy. Photographing love interests with every glamor shot session. I found myself rooting for him; such a good guy. Compelling and witty. Grimacing when he blows a love connection..

The movie. It's smart. Because you think you know where it's going and then you realize it's not going where you think it's going until you get there...twice.

Highly recommended for viewers who like the sense of being told a bed time story that doesn't end in ""Good Night, John Boy.""

5721746,4,B00CFPC8EO,"This is NOT a horror film or even a thriller. It showed up as such a while back and the few reviews were all very negative (shocking, huh? trendy is more like it) so I didn't watch it till it showed up on NF recently. I am cutting and pasting my review from there:

This film is not scary, but slightly suspenseful, and a little gritty. Its not horror or thriller, although it shows up in those searches. What it is is a very well done film that is really a character driven psychological drama that deals with death, trauma, loss, and connection. Or should I say dis-connection. If you enjoy films that are about off the beaten path people, people with issues, and like a puzzle (whodunnwhattowhoandhow)- there is a red herring cleverly concealed therein, that leaves you wondering till the end, literally, what's going on. The production values are strong, the acting is excellent, the story is interesting, unique, and the ending, poetic and ironically beautiful. A must see for anyone who likes artistic, indie flicks that portray a beyond the mainstream slice of life. And, as usual, ignore the haters. They know not what they are talking about.",1400198400,3,1150,4.721393034825871
5721747,3,B00CFPC8EO,"Kevin is a photographer who `does women mostly', he works in his own studio with one assistant - Jamie. He seems to be unlucky in love and so has a thing whereby he asks every one of them out - normally to the movies. Most of them - understandably - say no. He is also haunted by the tragic death of his sister when he was a young boy and can not somehow reconcile that he is not somehow culpable in her death.

He spends time telling us of the ways he has used to `forget' the many women he has been on dates with and at first this was sort of endearing, but as the film develops you will see the veil of innocence slowly slipping to reveal a much more questionable form of amnesia. Oh and Jamie is madly in love with him too.

This has been described a `genre defying' by a few commentators, but it is probably best seen as a film of two or even three parts. The innocence , the questioning and the truth and that is where it becomes much more chilling and gets to the foundation or the whole raison d'tre of the movie. It is well acted and Christopher Denham as Kevin is particularly convincing. I think where it falls down is the slow reveal; so as that in the beginning you are not sure what is going on and aside from feeling sorry for Kevin you are left pretty much unengaged and whilst this may have been a necessary build up for the film makers it probably could have been handled better.

Still I found this to be a very good watch, it did take its time though and I think I was non plussed for at least half and then hooked for the last half hour or so - so whilst some detractors may have been harsh they do still have a point - I, however remain pleased to have seen it.

Please note I received a copy fro review purposes.",1399507200,,1735,4.064327485380117
5721748,3,B00CFPC8EO,"I'm a fan of Film Movement and their award winning films.  Film Movement has launched a new brand, Ram Releasing, that will be showcasing films of a different genre - thrillers, suspense, even horror films. And that's right up my alley - I love scary films. One of their first releases is Forgetting the Girl from director Nate Taylor.

 The film opens with Kevin Wolfe filming a 'if you see this...' talk. Kevin is a photographer specializing in head shots. He asks out every woman whose portrait he takes. And most say no. The few that do say yes rarely say yes a second time. And it those women that Kevin wants to forget. To forget he engages in activities such as a shopping spree or joining the gym. The one person he can't remember and doesn't want to forget is his sister, who drowned when they were both children.

 Spoilers below.

 I thought Christopher Denham did a good job in the role of Kevin. He presents as an affable young man with a ready smile for those whose attention he wants. But there's something off about him. His sense of desperation and obsessiveness isn't far beneath the surface. And something else is behind that glib exterior as well. Lindsay Beamish is Jamie, his suicidal make-up artist, who is infatuated with Kevin. She too turned in a good performance. There are a few other characters as well. Kevin's grandmother Ruby is there to act a historical record of Kevin's past. Jamie's sponsor seemed awkward and seemed to only be there to underscore Jamie's fragile state. (The camping trip was ridiculous) And the creepy, porn watching landlord? A very obvious red herring. Although I must say, his brief role was frightening - especially in the elevator with one of Kevin's clients.

 The exploration of Kevin's 'forgetting' would have been suitably creepy if it only applied to his adult life. And this would have sent the film in the direction that the trailer seemed to promise. I found the trailer misleading - the darkest bits of the film are showcased and seem to promise a different film than was delivered. Kevin's attempts to remember his sister just grew tiresome after a few times.

 But things speed up as both Kevin and Jamie start to lose control and things hurtle towards an inevitable, but sadly surprising ending. Forgetting the Girl was just okay for this viewer. However, the two trailers included for coming releases, App and Hide and Seek do have me intrigued.",1397174400,,2417,4.730952380952381
5721749,5,B00CFPC8EO,"Kevin Wolfe (Christopher Denham)  is a professional photographer, whose specialty is taking headshots, which means would be actresses and models look deeply into his lenses wearing big smiles, never thinking that the guy behind the camera taking those photos is not the one with whom they are trying to make a connection.  He thinks he makes a connection with Adrienne (Anna Camp), but she soon makes it clear to him that he was wrong.  A couple of dates with Beth (Elizabeth Rice) give Kevin reason to hope, but by that point in the film we are hardly optimistic that he can find anything remotely like a happy ending, although we could be wrong about that.

Traumatized by the death of his sister as a child, Kevin has trouble remembering much about Nicole beyond the color of her eyes.  This is rather ironic, since he struggles to forget the women with who he has failed relationships.  Kevin is one of those people who berates himself out loud every time he has once again convinced himself that there is something there with a woman, even if the woman is still in the room.  Not surprisingly, Kevin is so busy being drawn to the women he sees through his camera that he is totally unaware that his assistant, Jamie (Lindsay Beamish) is totally into him.  She has her own issues, as a recovering addict, but love is a powerful thing.  Kevin's blind spot extends to Tanner (Paul Sparks), the creepy guy  who hovers around the photographer's life and the women whose pictures he takes.

Director Nate Taylor's first feature film has a story and script by Peter Moore Smith, and was made for only $600K, which leads you to believe they waste a lot of money making movies at major studios.  ""Forgetting the Girl"" lives up to its self-declared ""gritty vision"" of Kevin and his world.  Denham's performance strikes the right balance between sympathy and strangeness, so that we feel for Kevin but are also uncomfortably with rooting for him to solve the problem of his love life.  This makes Denham perfect for the main role in this tale, because it is vitally important that we are drawn into the narrative but at the same time have the pesky feeling that there is something wrong that we just cannot put our finger on.

I got the DVD for this movie, put it in the pile of ones I had not watched yet, and played it without knowing any other than the title of the movie, which made for a rather unique cinematic experience these days of knowing nothing about a movie.  The opening certainly establishes a sense of foreboding, but no matter how refined your skill at predicting how this one is going to play out, I think you will definitely be surprised by at least one if not more of its plot twists, making this one of the more memorable little horror flicks I have seen in sometime.  It was certainly the first one in a long time that I immediately went back and watched again.  The special features on this DVD include director's commentary, deleted scenes, and five web videos containing footage not in the film.",1395619200,7,3015,4.603738317757009
5721750,2,B00CFPC8EO,"...leading to an unsatisfying conclusion.

""Forgetting the Girl"" is a genre-confused, muddled mess of a movie that quickly will make you lose interest in the fate of any of its main characters as it tries to decide what it wants to be. In the end, it can't make up its own mind about whether it's a psycho-sexual thriller, a whodunit, or a piece of noir about urban alienation (and lets not even talk about the dalliances into romcom as Kevin kvetches in front of his dates about the latest stupid thing he's just said). In the end, it executes none of these in an elegant way, and led me to total indifference about what happens to any of its main characters.

The movie centers on the life of Kevin Wolfe, a 30-something New York City studio photographer. He specializes in head shots for aspiring models and actresses (""$300 for the digital package; prints extra...""). His M.O. is to ask each of his subjects out sometime during their photo sessions. Then, when he is either rejected immediately --or after an awkward date or two-- he engages in some sublimating activity to help him forget about them (a trip to the MOMA; a gym membership, a shopping spree...you get the picture). Orbiting Kevin's creepy little world are his assistant Jamie, all goth and black (and in recovery, full of self-loathing and secretly crazy about Kevin...really crazy...as in stalking him on dates crazy) and his landlord, Tanner. Tanner seems to do nothing other than collect rent from Kevin and share his latest discoveries in porn. Lingering in the background are Kevin's grandmother (Ruby) and Jamie's gay 12-step sponsor, Derek.

Kevin's dates are awkward because of his lingering mommy issues (she died during the birth of his sister), enduring sister issues (his younger sister drowned when he was seven or eight), and a total lack of filters when navigating the early hours and days of relationships.

When Jamie confesses her long-time crush on Kevin, the plot thickens. But by this point, I had stopped caring what happens to either of them. Suffice it to say there are connections between Jamie's self-loathing, Kevin's awkwardness, and some of the reasons he works so hard to ""forget"" his girls.

In the end, the movie takes mercy on us by being only 85 minutes long, although it seems like much longer as it overindulges in both Kevin's fidgetiness with his dates (think of Billy Crystal or Woody Allen) and Jamie's obsession with Kevin. It creeps (literally and figuratively) towards a most unsatisfying conclusion. So here's the takeaway: if you are an aspiring actress or model, and your head shot studio photographer hits on you: both ""yes"" and ""no"" have equal potential to be the wrong answer. Kevin had his ways for forgetting the girls. You've been warned: watch this movie at your peril, because if you do, I don't have a suggestion for how to make you forget you've made such a choice.

This is a release from RAM Releasing, which provided this copy for review.",1395619200,,2967,4.830708661417323
5721751,4,B00CFPC8EO,"Kevin Wolfe is a lonely young photographer in New York City, supporting himself by taking head shots of young models and actresses.  When he asks his clients for a date he is almost invariably shot down, and his rare successes are embarrassingly short lived.  Keven is haunted by the need to ""forget the girl"" who has caused him pain, a haunting that goes all the way back to a horrible childhood trauma.  Eventually his need leads to greater tragedy and a somewhat equivocal ending for Kevin himself.

Forgetting the Girl is a realistic, gritty depiction of loneliness in the middle of an enormous city.  Besides the main story line, there are several secondary plots involvling Kevin's landlord and his assistant.  Christopher Denham does a remarkable job of portraying Kevin, and the rest of the cast is just as well chosen.

5721753,1,B00CFPC8EO,The cover art makes this look like a thriller.  Unfortunately the filmmakers had other ideas.  Forgetting the Girl is about a studio photographer who takes head shots for wannabe actresses and his funky assistant who is not so secretly in love with him.  For the bulk of the film he narrates his general ineptitude with relationships and for more than 90% of its running time Forgetting the Girl plays like a dull indie relationship drama.  Then the movie takes a radical left turn but by that point its way too late to matter.  This doesn't succeed as a drama or as a thriller and is ultimately just a dreary downer with little to recommend it beyond Anna Camp's few scenes.

I think it would be even better on a second viewing, now that I know the ending.

Great performance by Christopher Denham. He's going to be a rising star for sure.

Every single shot in this film is simply stunning.  Adding to that is an incredible cast that gives a 5 star performance.  Christopher Denham is excellent at portraying Kevin Wolfe who hopelessly falls for every girl he photographs.  Also loved the performance by Phyllis Somerville as Ruby!  This film is so well directed with such a unique story that if you're looking to watch a film unlike anything you've seen before, look no further than Forgetting the Girl.",1373068800,2,599,4.766990291262136

5721768,5,B00CFPC8EO,"This film takes the viewer on a journey through the psyche of a bewildered man in his youth, who's inherent desire, not unlike those which we all experience, for human compassion, emotional connection, and acceptance of loss and denial, begin to drastically affect not only his life, but the lives of the people in which he befriends and confides in. Forgetting the Girl, seems to float within a realm of ""non-genre"", although that is not to say that the narrative isn't being represented in such a way that the viewer cannot discern the stories purpose, but that it plays between the boundary lines of a pseudo romance, drama, thriller and horror at the same time and achieves this with ease and an apparent show of skill and cinematic knowledge. This film is filled with moments that will draw you in, grab your attention, and then within the span of a few frames, completely throw that all of out the window, leave you with your hands over your head, eyes glued to the screen ,cringing, but all the while wanting to do it all over again. The beauty of a film like this is that it allows the audience to ask questions not only of themselves but the characters and the story as well as their expectations and interpretations of how things will play out, and it has done so with purpose.  Highly recommended. Check it out and enjoy.",1372291200,4,1332,4.5966386554621845

The film is beautifully shot and could just sit back and be a visual tour de force but the nuanced performances of every character from leading to supporting is not often found in movies these days. What I most enjoyed was that when I was no longer watching the film I was thinking about it or discussing different nuances of it for hours and even days after. While many cinema pieces these days dumb things down I was thrilled to find a thoughtful, beautifully directed piece with lagers, facets and intrigue around every corner.

Denham and Beamish perform compellingly, presenting deeply flawed humanity yearning to be...something better.  Something perfect.

5721777,5,B00CFPC8EO,"What seemingly starts off as a typical rom-com slowly turns into a twisted thriller, that will keep you engrossed the entire time.

Kevin (Christopher Denham) a head-shot photographer based in NYC seems obsessed asking every girl he shoots on a date, always getting rejected- you start rooting for this likable main character. But with persistence finally meets the perfect girl next door.

You soon discover that something is just not quite right, but you can't put your finger on it. The director (Nate Taylor) brilliantly starts putting this intricate puzzle together, but yet keeps some pieces to himself- which leaves you theorizing and dissecting each scene.

The acting is superb and believable and nothing feels over done. The imagery is haunting and beautiful at the same time.

If you like psychological thrillers then I highly recommend ""Forgetting the Girl."" Take a journey into the dark recesses of the mind and soon you won't be ""Forgetting the Girl"" anytime soon.",1372118400,3,978,5.132075471698113
5721778,5,B00CFPC8EO,"Forgetting the Girl, is a skillful journey through some dark places with some damaged people. How these damaged people cope and damage others in the process. Director (Nate Taylor) keeps the story clear, sharp and grounded as we work our way through the confused thoughts and actions of the characters. He draws some painfully convincing performances from his players at times when many directors fall back on tricks. Taylor never shies away from these moments and keeps us connected. His camera work supports his storytelling with a rich level of textures and values.

Peter Moore Smith has written a tale that displays people wanting what they cannot get and refusing to accept what they have. This unfortunate spiral works it way deeper down like an auger as the film progresses. You want to reach out, grab them, shake them and smack them straight. But that wouldn't help, not these characters

This cinematic combination harkens to the likes of David; Cronenberg and Fincher.  Dark, truthful and beautiful; both visually and thematically. It's no light fair and it takes a while to shake this film, but it is a great new addition to the collection. I look forward the the next work from this director.",1372118400,3,1206,4.931034482758621

Denham brings emotional depth and likeability to a difficult role that could easily be over-the-top or one-dimensional in the wrong actor's hands. The great performances and carefully-crafted cinematography and editing lend the film a reality that make it all the more disturbing.

First, the movie was beautifully shot in New York City, the most perfect backdrop for a psychological thriller. Also, the acting was so real that the movie had my suspension of disbelief in high gear from the moment it started and I couldn't stop thinking about the movie when it was over. The lead actor, Christopher Denham,  who played Kevin did a brilliant job at making me want to like him even though he is such a flawed character. He left me wondering if we are born flawed or do our past experiences damage us and can our present experiences heal us from our past? It has been a long time since I have loved an Indie film like this.

5721791,4,B00CFPC8EO,"Forgetting the Girl is a dark and twisted film that left me emotionally drained and mildly concerned who might be living next door. The director (Nate Taylor) brilliantly crafts a slow build of tension and dark suspicion as the viewer is drawn into an uncomfortable intimacy with the lead character played by Christopher Denham. Denham masterfully portrays a deeply and genuinely disturbed individual struggling to find some sense of normalcy in a relationship while surrounding himself with equally, if not more overtly damaged personae. Deserving of special mention for her amazing performance is Lindsay Beamish who played Denham's obsessive and thoroughly screwed up assistant.

The slow build of this film is laced with such real emotion and frightening honesty that I was left wondering whether the director did some extracurricular study of mental health issues to so succinctly draw out such amazing insights into the psychoses of his characters. Even after the crescendo, the director (and Beamish) left me wondering whether the reveal answered all of the mysteries crafted throughout the film or if there was more than meets the eye. This movie makes me want to run background checks on my neighbors...or not have any neighbors. I'm not sure. A+ job by the Director, cast and crew.",1371513600,3,1291,5.206730769230769
5721792,5,B00CFPC8EO,"Forgetting the Girl is one of those films that gets under your skin as you watch it, and lingers after you've finished it. A lushly directed psychological drama that centers around Kevin Wolfe (Christopher Denham of Argo/Charlie Wilson's War/Shutter Island/Sound of my Voice,) an awkward romantic dreamer who, though he works regularly as a photographer with women can't seem to move past his inherent inability to truly connect with them when it comes to dating.

With a past colored by an unfortunate family history, Kevin uses various techniques in his struggle to forget each of his past failings with the women he dates before moving on to the next. Tension mounts, however, when one particular dating escapade seemingly goes awry, putting him in the middle of an uncomfortable investigation surrounding her inexplicable disappearance.

Taylor deftly directs Kevin's emotional unraveling to the point where as a viewer you're not quite sure what's truth and what's not. And apparently Taylor, along with writer Peter Moore Smith, are not ones to just ride that tension out, instead they dial it up to 11 and leave viewers with a stunningly unexpected climax and subsequent denouement that is anything but easy to shake.

Kudos across the board, especially to Denham for carrying the role with simultaneously likeable yet creepy aplomb.",1371340800,3,1340,5.223255813953489

5721794,5,B00CFPC8EO,"""Forgetting the Girl"" is one of those movies that sticks with you long after the credits roll. Not an easy feat, but one that I consider essential for a film in order to remember it, discuss it to death, and even dream about it. Yes, I dreamt about this movie long after I saw it, the visceral images and suspenseful storyline lingering in my mind many a night. Kudos to director Nate Taylor and writer Peter Moore Smith for fashioning a totally original story in this day and age of cookie-cutter flicks.

The film starts out as a slightly rom-com look at the life of a New York-based headshot photographer named Kevin (played by the eerie Christopher Denham in a remarkable tour-de-force). Always searching for the perfect girl, perhaps one to take the place of his sister, Kevin asks every photography subject out on a date to mostly awkward results. His lovelorn assistant Jamie, a tough-looking goth girl with her own serious issues portrayed by the extraordinary Lindsay Beamish with a perpetual wounded look in her eyes, will do anything to make Kevin her own, even though she doesn't seem to exist in his eyes. All that changes when one of Kevin's dates goes missing. What follows is a labyrinth of twists and turns that slowly turn into something more powerful and psychologically disturbing than one would expect. In fact, it left me breathless. To give any more plot points away would be a crime, but you can call me guilty of loving this movie.

""Forgetting the Girl"" is one of those singular movies that challenges the viewer to give up all expectations of the norm, forcing one to dive headfirst into the mind of a very complex character. I, for one, was swept away.",1370304000,7,1680,4.691525423728813
5721795,5,B00CFPC8EO,"I'll keep this short. The worst thing about forgetting the girl is the title. Not because it's bad, but only because it doesn't sound like a horror or monster movie should. But it is a wonderfully new approach to what we know as horror in films. People confuse scary with horror. Cheap thrills with mental torture are scary. FTG is horror at it's best. It stays with you. There's almost no blood but there is a monster of epic proportion. The acting is awesome as is the script and the look of the film itself. I salute the filmmakers.  I don't want to give anything away so I will keep it vague,but for me, this reminded me of going to see Silence of the lambs for the first time. I knew I was seeing something scary but I had no idea where it would go. This is every bit as good as SOTL, just with a NYC downtown kind of feel to it. Definitely see it.
