But the seller sent me a children's cartoon move called ""Krishna"", when I had ordered a 1959 Bollywood classic called ""Kanhaiya"" starred Raj Kapoor and Nutan. The pictures and titles on top of the DVD and on the outside cover were all were for ""Kanhaiya"" , but the DVD was for ""Krishna"".

This incident surprised me because a previous product that I purchased from I from the seller ""Iola's Dream"", namely the Bollywood movie ""Arth"", is great.",1400976000,,499,4.735632183908046
8442647,4,B004V2FW5Q,"Kanhaiya was directed by Om Prakash in the year 1959.
This old hindi bollywood stars Raj Kapoor, Nutan Behl and  Lalita Pawar. Its one of the top Back and Whites, who took the highest gross for the year 1959. The movie is quite popular among freaks.
Music of the movie is given by Shankar Jaikishan and lyrics by Shailendra. Songs are good and are sung by Mukesh Kumar.
Overall, the movie is cool!",1305849600,,397,4.438356164383562
