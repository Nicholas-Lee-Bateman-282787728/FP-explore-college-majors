4227944,1,B003Y8YB3C,I am going to get right to the point. This movie hands down is the (WORST MOVIE EVER MADE). Worse than Charles Angels Full Throttle and that is saying a lot. Terror Planet is just gross and ultra violent with an un- origonal Dawn of the Dead like story. Death Proof is very long and boring what you see in Death proof is four girls yapping yapping yapping drinking beer yap yap yap smoke some drugs yap yap yap drink some more beer yawn .....zzzzzzzzzz zzzzzz Whoa ! What ! sorry I nodded off so boring. Next we see the girls in a car yap yap yaping then around a table yap yap yaping....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  sorry .  It was at this point my wife and I could not take anymore and we got up and walked out. I have always liked Quentin Taratinos movies but trust me this is BAD . You can`t sell garbage today just because you sold a good product yesterday.,1179014400,6,851,4.214723926380368
4227945,5,B003Y8YB3C,My advice is to see this at a movie theatre with a big time sound system. It's also better to see it with a group. This is a Fun experience.,1177459200,2,140,3.7
4227946,3,B003Y8YB3C,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez love movies, love audiences and obviously have a deep rooted nostalgia for 1970's schlock drive-in movies. Because of this they have fashioned an homage, by way of their new collaborative Saturday afternoon movie program, ""Grindhouse"" comprised of two features, one by each filmmaker as well as previews for films and advertisements for restaurants one I am particularly fond of: ""Acuna Mexican Restaurants.""
Rodriquez directs a Zombie movie, ""Planet Terror"" which is high on gore, brutality, blood-letting and misanthropy more than anything seen of late specifically gorier than the latest version of ""Dawn of the Dead."" Rose McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez star as erstwhile lovers who are thrown together by accident by an onslaught of blood sucking, infection carrying Zombies intent on eating anything and everything in their way. McGowan, looking remarkably beautiful and Rodriquez, of ""6 Feet Under"" fame looking and acting remarkably macho and aggressive try their best to overcome director Rodriguez's basically brutal and ugly mise en scene but unfortunately succeed in merely surviving with their sunny humanity intact by ""Planet Terror's"" end.
Though only an hour and a half long. ""Planet Terror"" goes on way too long as heads roll and pus-filled face boils squirt onto everyone who happens by and the wit and irony that should be involved here never materializes. ""Planet Terror"" panders to the worst of what makes us human: in fact it panders to what is sub-human and ugly about us. It is without charm or humanity. ""Shaun of the Dead"" this is definitely not.
Tarantino's entry into this freak show is ""Death Proof"" a  re-hash of such movies as ""Vanishing Point"" and ""White Line Fever."" But, as opposed to the dreary ""Planet Terror,"" ""Death Proof"" is lean, dynamically paced, well acted, well cast, fun to watch and bolstered by not one but two sets of strong, sarcastic women... the second set of which features Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms as stunt women who set upon ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell) and show him the what for in a terrific long scene involving two dueling 1970, 440 Dodge Challengers fueled by male and female machismo to burn. It's a lot of nasty fun to watch and the women in the audience that I was part of went crazy for the turnaround logic of the whole extravaganza.
So, overall ""Grindhouse"" is a draw: one hit and one miss. It's fun in a limited, fan-boy, inside joke kind of a way but not near fun enough to be taken seriously as are the true stars of this kind of enterprise like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" or ""Showgirls"": prime grade, best quality schlock of the first order.",1176422400,2,2655,4.952914798206278
4227947,2,B003Y8YB3C,"Planet Terror was fairly entertaining, but Death Proof was a sorry piece of work.  Tarrantino rehashing old characters, a female Samuel Jackson and an cry-baby atagonist sums up this flick.  I did like the ""cash only"" picture over the bar in the Chili House scene however.",1176249600,3,272,4.891304347826087
4227948,5,B003Y8YB3C,"Tarantino and Rodriguez set out revisit an era of film that found widespread acclaim in the 70's and 80's.  The term ""grindhouse"" is/was used for films generally of a low budget that featured excessive gore, violence, profanity, and sex.  Needless to say, the two accomplished that feat.

Where they mixed it up a bit is what makes the film worth your 8 dollars.  They added decent plots, well done characters, and loads of fun.  I can honestly say that I have not been this entertained in quite some time.  Rodriguez had written 'Planet Terror' while filming 'The Faculty', saying, ""The zombie genre is dead, but I have a feeling it will be coming back soon.  I need to shoot this film.""  As we are all aware, the zombie film has come back into the limelight, lacking Rodriguez's contribution.  He and Tarantino created a masterpiece of modern cinema, perhaps revamping a genre that for the most part was dead.

'Planet Terror' is a film filled with zombies, lesbian go-go dancers, profanity, sex, blood, gore, and great fight sequences.  It stars Freddy Rodriguez in a role that is best described as a pseudo-protagonist.  He is the most developed character, anyway.  Bruce Willis and Tarantino himself lend a helping hand and deliver a mindblowing first two hours.

In between the two films are faux movie trailers directed by Rob Zombie, ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", ""Don't"" by Edgar Wright (Director of 'Shaun of the Dead', and 'Hot Fuzz'), and a third entitled, ""Thanksgiving.""  The trailers are worth holding your restroom break till the end.  My personal favorite moment being Nicholas Cage's cameo as Dr. Fu Manchu.

'Deathproof"" is the title of Tarantino's half of this madness.  The main character, Stuntman Mike played by Kurt Russell, toys with the idea of taking a vehicle and reinforcing it to be able to handle stunts such as careening into a brick wall at 75 mph while leaving the driver unharmed.  Tarantino had been developing the idea for a while, using the deathproof vehicle as the centerpiece of a slasher type horror film.  This was his attempt.  It features one of the best car chases in film history in which he uses no, I repeat, NO, special effects.  All of the vehicles that appear to be going 90 mph, in fact are.

'Grindhouse' is the most fun I have had at the theatre in a long time and I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys watching carnal desires exploited to the fullest extent.  Is this a date movie?  Only if you have a cool girlfriend.  Do yourself a favor.  See this movie.",1175904000,40,2518,4.715596330275229
4227949,5,B003Y8YB3C,"Tarantino and Rodriguez have really outdone themselves in this hilarious gem!

I was lucky enough to see this on an unseasonably warm spring night at the drive in theater, no doubt a perfect viewing environment for this surprisingly good film.

Both directors bring in their best sense of humor and style to their respective features.  The stunts, cheesy effects, dialogue and T&A were perfectly executed, paying a wonderful homage to early 70's grindhouse cinema while still maintaining the unique charms we expect fromo these directors.",1175904000,5,538,5.305882352941176

Insomnia, unhappy in Humboldt (there is a title for any horror movie)  and the beautifully strong women in both movies led me to the impulsive decision of moving to Austin. Yep. Now I live in Austin. It's a huge city. That's why movies have a creative license for creating a fantasy city with white lies like, ""That's what I love about Austin. It's such a small town."" Fantasy aside, I loved both movies, played in the order both directors intended them to be seen in. Both very different and both excellent.

8408926,5,B003Y8YB3C,"Despite the homogeneous nature of cinema, I keep going to the theater. Largely, it's because of dudes like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Taratino, both of whom go their own way and both of whom offer up something that's so distinctively theirs that their names have become namebrands for a certain type of film. When they collaborated on this one, I knew it was gonna be something outrageous and offbeat, something decidedly unhomogeneous. With fanboy nudges and winks galore, these two maverick directors take us back to 1970s shlock with the gleefully offensive homage, GRINDHOUSE. In its sheer excessiveness and blatantly hokey sensibilities, this double feature pulls no punches. It treats the audience to crass, old school sensationalism, incidental nudity, fake-looking geysers of blood, and rampant visceral disembowelment. And I loved the hell out of it. In their efforts to mimic that grungy sensation of being in the cruddy theaters of old that specialized in playing trashy cinema, Rodriguez and Tarantino manufacture scratches on the print, projector miscues, sound goofs, and bad dubbing. We even have title cards apologizing for missing reels, which occur in the most inconvenient of times. My neighbor, who is in his 60s and who went to see this film in the theater, told me that that exactly was what it was like in those low-rent, B-movie playhouses back in the day.

The double-feature bill started with Rodriguez's cheesily apocalyptic PLANET TERROR, of which film title alone is reminiscent of many of those old timey sci-fi/horror B-movies. The plot centers on a mass zombie attack and humanity's last stand as embodied by a one-legged go-go dancer (played with jaded taciturnity by Rose McGowan), her inexplicably lethal boyfriend (Freddie Rodriguez), an adulterous, needles-touting nurse, and a few others. This feature is replete with campy dialogue and over the top, hilariously staged horror and action sequences. It also offers up a print that is marvelously grimy and grainy, and Rodriguez himself comes up with a pretty effective John Carpenter-like synth score that actually goes a far way in driving the no-nonsense storyline. By the way, creature make-up artist Tom Savini gets a bit part here as he plays a digit-less deputy, while Naveen Andrews is great fun to watch as the testicles-collecting bio-engineer.

The second billing is Tarantino's very talky DEATH PROOF, which is a callback to films such as VANISHING POINT, DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY, and the original  GONE IN 60 SECONDS (all of which are referenced in this flick). And, if anyone's seen the 1965 flick FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! then DEATH PROOF will also have a certain familiarity. Kurt Russell does a deliciously villainous turn as the scarred Stuntman Mike who uses his death-proofed vehicle to viciously do away with gorgeous dames. Except he made the worst mistake of his life when he picked on fellow stuntperson Zoe Bell (who doubled for Uma Thurman in KILL BILL and who, here, plays herself).

With respect to the very natural Zoe Bell and her awesome ship's mast stunt, to me, the one to watch is Sydney Poitier (yes, it's his daughter) who plays the casually sexy Jungle Julia, she of the ravishing feet. Meanwhile, Rosario Dawson again can't help but sizzle on screen, while the very pouty-lipped Vanessa Ferlito...pouts her lips. If you're into extended dialogue that bears that distinctive Tarantino flourish, then the first half of this film is right up your alley because it's all significantly verbal and catered to the gentler sex - ""gentler"" being qualified here in that f-bombs are dropped with the utmost gusto. However, if you're an action fan, just wait 'til the second half because, then, Tarantino pulls out all the stops.

Last but certainly not least, mention must go to the quartet of coming attraction trailers which range from the hilarious (MACHETE - ""He just f***ed with the wrong Mexican!"") to cliched shlock (DON'T and WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS) to vaguely disturbing (I don't even want to know what was going on in Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING). There's also an ad for some kind of Tex-Mex restaurant with dubious shots of its menu samples, which made me queasy just looking at 'em.

Rodriguez and Tarantino, in their celebation of the exploitation films, inject GRINDHOUSE with exuberance and a fantastic sense of nostalgia, as well as the occasional drops of subversive humor. In doing this, they elevate their passion project tiers above the basement level of such genre filmmaking. At the time, I'd crowed that their knack for crafting cinematic icons would give Cherry Darling, Stuntman Mike, and Zoe Bell immediate cult status a la the Bride or El Mariachi. But I'm thinking I was wrong. These figures aren't as embedded in the public consciousness. Whatevs. Back whenever these two movies played one after the other in the theater, at three hours long, yeah, my bum fell asleep. But that was a small price to pay for having gained admittance into blissfully trashy paradise.",1488240000,,5011,5.082624544349939
