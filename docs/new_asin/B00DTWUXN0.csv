8597694,2,B00DTWUXN0,"Compared to other bollywood style workout DVDs, BollyFit is amateur. It looks like its made by a lady in small room with a few of her friends.

The dance moves being shown are simple and just basic bollywood steps. You can learn better moves on watching free online videos. I did not break a sweat working out.

The producing was the worse. Looks like it was made by a student, with one basic camera. During most of the DVD the music is playing, you can see Anuja R. speaking, but her voice is not getting picked up.  I honestly cannot believe how bad this DVD was produced. How can a professional DVD be put out which is produced with the instructors mouth moving but the words are missing!!

The DVD packaging is simple, on recycled paper, which is fine. The music was fine. The art work was fine. These 3 items were the only reason I didn't state that I hated it.  But, based on just the dance moves, style of dance, and the producing, then I would say I HATED this DVD.

There are many other options on Amazon for Bollywood style fitness which are far better that this local dance studio mess.",1387324800,4,1097,4.352941176470588
8597695,5,B00DTWUXN0,"BollyFit is a unique and enjoyable way to get a full workout for the body, mind, and soul.  The DVD is a great representation of the BollyFit classes that are sweeping the nation!  The music is catchy, the choreography is fun and fresh, and the overall feel of the DVD is like you are in a room with your closest friends just having a good time dancing!  It is so refreshing to see a DVD geared to, and comprised of, people from all different ages, backgrounds, fitness and dance levels, and body types.  The minute I turn on my DVD, I know that for the next hour, I am going to break out into a good sweat and have fun all at the same time!  I've already given the DVD to family as gifts, and they are all hooked on BollyFit!",1375660800,,726,4.120567375886525
8597696,5,B00DTWUXN0,"I put this in the player as soon as it arrived - pushed play and watched the whole thing through one time while multi-tasking with household chores.  When it finished I replayed and joined the ladies; it was easy to follow and very similar to being in the room with anyone teaching a dance class.  This is a bit different from the normal ""feel the burn"" workouts because throughout the instruction, Anuja invites the viewer to relax, be comfortable and have fun.  I ended up working up a sweat without feeling like I had exerted myself in any way - in fact the warm up and cool down really felt like a spa experience where you finish feeling very refreshed.  I also appreciate the diversity of her cast - there is no 'cookie cutter' person that Anuja is leading.  All will be comfortable with this instruction, anyone who likes to dance will have a blast, and participants will no doubt be wanting more Anuja and BollyFit in the future!  Definite 5 stars (from someone who has tried every workout on the planet).  This is by far my favorite.",1375142400,,1041,4.50531914893617
8597697,5,B00DTWUXN0,"Having spent a long time in India studying yoga I'm always encouraged to see how the Subcontinent's influences continue to spread globally. Imagine my surprise when I learned of BollyFit, an innovative and fun melding of Bollywood music and dance in a fun mind/spirit/body exercise routine.

""Welcome to BollyFit"" is a treat and a great primer for established fans like myself or for those new and curious to Indian traditional and popular culture.",1374019200,,448,5.136986301369863
8597698,5,B00DTWUXN0,"I'm generally not a fan of workout videos, but Bollyfit is different. Anuja, the teacher and founder, is positive and motivating, the dancers are of all ages and body shapes, the music is great. I appreciate the welcoming feeling of this program, plus you sweat! I especially liked receiving the DVD in a printed and adorable recyclable cardboard case. I'm a fan!",1373500800,,363,4.870967741935484
