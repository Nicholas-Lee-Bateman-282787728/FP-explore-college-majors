8568421,2,B00BH418HC,I found this western very disappointing even though I usually like  Frank Lovejoy. Frank should stick to gangster police shows.,1386374400,,127,5.35
8568422,4,B00BH418HC,"We aren't really shown much of Cole's deadly speed with a gun, so I am not too sure the blurb above from the Publicity makes sense...However! Thanks to Warner Archive ""Made to Order"" for this 1958 Allied Artists western starring Frank Lovejoy (who I feel is miscast) and James Best (good guy) and Jan Merlin (Yes, you guessed it!) The bad guy. Beautiful Cinemascope print (you see everything), DeLux Colour and good sound make this a pleasure to watch for the western fan. For those who enjoy the support cast - Myron Healey plays twins (and they are both very very BAD), George Keymas is a hated ""Blue Belly"". Douglas Spencer and Frank Ferguson add gravitas to the proceedings. Lovely location work as Frank and James wander the wasteland and some good ""Township"" scenes. Two or three oddly placed studio sets don't spoil the outdoors feel. And of course you have the lovely Abby Dalton as the woman inquestion between James and Jan, (I always will remember her from Corman's ""VIKING WOMEN...). Not the best AA Western but a good one none the less. (Did Myron Healey EVER stop working??)",1365724800,2,1088,4.731578947368421
