7873654,3,6304534418,"This early outing from Jet Li's career features several stylistic similarities to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master/dp/B000067J48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master</a>&nbsp;but has a plot much closer to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tai-Chi-Master/dp/B003M9ZACY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tai Chi Master</a>.  As arguably Li's first-ever ""American"" movie, it's an entertaining and interesting exercise but features too much lost potential to justify a higher rating. Collectors will be interested, but general fans might get bored.

The story: When a disgruntled member of a Hong Kong wushu team (Dick Wei,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Project-A/dp/630580379X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Project A</a>) decides to stay in the U.S. while on tour, his teammate (Li) is also left behind when he tries to reclaim him. The two go separate ways, with the latter attaching himself to a big-dreaming grocer (Stephen Chow,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Back-to-School/dp/B000E3LGK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Back to School</a>&nbsp;series) while the former seeks employment with the underworld.

I've heard others describe this as a team-up between Jet Li and Stephen Chow, though it's ultimately more satisfying to think of as a collaboration of Li and Dick Wei. Though Chow plays a fairly interesting character, he's neither funny nor weird enough to live up to his reputation and feels like an underutilized player. Li and Wei benefit from a decent screenplay that illustrates an intriguing conflict of wills regarding immigration and mafia employment. Though far from bombastic, the story's definitely interesting enough to hold one's attention.

Fans of Hong Kong cinema will probably prefer this film over the aforementioned ""The Master,"" one of the reasons being that the cast is overwhelmingly Chinese. The supporting Asian characters are all played by Hong Kong performers, while most of the U.S. thugs and henchmen are played by Asian-Americans - George Chung, Steven Ho, Ernie Reyes Sr., and Stuart Quan. Disappointingly, only one henchman - Mark Williams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trained-to-Fight/dp/6302278813/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trained to Fight</a>) - is highlighted, and his moves aren't utilized to their fullest effect. Luckily, the fights in general tend to be good. There's 11 of them, and while several aren't great, others pick up the slack. Jet Li looks slightly uncomfortable performing a street-fighting style of combat, but he returns to his element near the end of the film when he leads a stellar brawl against a barnful of thugs with weapons.

I'm not surprised that this one hasn't seen a lot of recognition in the last quarter-century, but it's not nearly bad enough to be banished from publicity. If it's your desire to own every Jet Li vehicle ever made, this shouldn't be the last one you pick up.",1424822400,,3079,6.5

The fight sequences were cool, but the movie would have been better if the movie had at least some form of English in it.",1421712000,,320,4.095238095238095
7873657,4,6304534418,"The movie which stars Jet Li and Steven Chow is an average martial arts movie with terrific fight scenes. It has a shoestring story about one man trying to defect to America to find a better life by any means necessary.

  The dvd itself is the definition of a barebones release with no scene selection option and only one language option available. The option to turn on english subtitles or not. The only spoken language available is chinese and the occasional use of english by the actors in the movie(Steven Chow, Dick Wei, and some of the American actors).

  The video quality is barely above vhs quality and it is not anamorphic widescreen, but a letterbox presentation.  This dvd is a good buy if you only want to see the movie, until a better release comes along.",1221264000,5,772,4.591240875912408

wushu performer who gets stuck in San Francisco because of his friend who joins the local mafia gang and a series of event turns them against each other leading to an excellent final showdown. The martial arts sequences are very good and wireless.
What keeps this movie from a perfect 5 stars is the incredibly bad acting from the americans actors and too much bad language. But if you can get through that, this is a movie worth your money.",1006560000,3,506,4.451612903225806
