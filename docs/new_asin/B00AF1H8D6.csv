5414444,5,B00AF1H8D6,"If you thought you knew a lot about Africa, be prepared to learn more! I own BBC Earth's Life, Human Planet, Frozen Planet & Planet Earth and this is instantly my favorite that BBC Earth has to offer.

I wish it was longer and that they would have covered more areas of Africa but they have priced it accordingly. The picture quality is top notch & the audio sounds excellent.

Sir David Attenborough is the absolute best at what he does. I can watch this over and over again.",1362700800,4,476,4.337078651685394
5414445,5,B00AF1H8D6,Way great BBC production of another epic film series.  This look at wildlife on the African continent was just superb.  Bravo!!!,1362268800,,128,5.0476190476190474
5414446,5,B00AF1H8D6,"I caught the last two episodes of this series on Discovery channel and was so impressed that I pre-ordered it on DVD to watch with the entire series.  The plan at that time was to watch it and then pass on to my grandkids.  Even after having been on safari in Africa, I have been blown away by this series that I can not part with it and have ordered a 2nd one to give to the grandkids (who live out of state) so they can watch it as well.  I have even shared the series with someone that I know who is from Kenya and she too has been amazed by this series.  The videography in this series is spectacular and the things they captured on film is extraordinary.  This is a must see for all ages!",1362182400,,693,3.9927536231884058
5414447,5,B00AF1H8D6,"I've been watching nature documentaries for decades now, so I approach these newer ones with weary skepticism, especially since the wave of glossy 'remake-upgrades' started by Planet Earth. In this specific case, the topic is the wildlife of Africa, which has been covered in almost every major BBC documentary so far, as well as hundreds of other docs, and it has also been the focus of the very good 'Wild Africa' series (also by the BBC).

The one detail with 'Africa' that gave me hope was that it was produced by Mike Gunton, producer of arguably the best of the new breed of documentaries: 'Life'.

I am happy to report that this one is just as good as Life, if not better.

The approach here is to find footage of surprising, educational and entertaining animal behaviour not seen before and film it in dramedy style as with Life. In addition, the documentary masterfully combines summary information on the natural history and climate to provide a complete picture of nature and wildlife in each habitat as an integrated whole.

A typical scene in this series will describe the available food in a region and the challenges specific to that habitat, then introduce a native animal cast, and film a little dramatic, unusual, surprising or funny sequence, such as monster armoured crickets with poison blood attacking baby birds, or a lizard sneaking up on sleeping lions to eat the flies off its face.

If you ever walked in nature, you should know about these moments when you observe animals you already know doing something surprising. Well this series is like a condensed compilation of these moments, some thrilling, some sad, some very amusing. And this is backed by carefully chosen music and narrative to enhance the drama or comical aspects.

Where Fothergill's approach with Planet Earth/Frozen Planet seems to be to focus on postcard landscapes and thrilling hunts, Gunton uses stunning landscapes only as an introduction, and then makes nature intimate, surprising, beautiful, exciting and slightly anthropomorphic. Now I can see this approach being abused by the wrong person and becoming manipulative and cheap, but Gunton seems to know how to balance it all superbly.

As you can guess from the above description, the structure on this one is more tight than recent sloppy BBC documentaries, because it strives to draw a full picture of five very different habitats in Africa (Kalahari, Savannah, Congo, Cape and Sahara). That said, it avoids repeating footage on the same old wildlife and regional information by quickly summarizing the habitat and then focusing on these new findings. Which means that you can combine this series with previous ones and still get something new, as well as watch the amazing landscapes in high-definition with stunning photography.

There are five episodes, making this half the length of Life, but they finally stopped bothering with an overview episode, and this series feels like it chose only top-quality, new and rich footage instead of padding it with repetitive postcards. A superb production! It also includes a sixth episode covering various conservationist projects in Africa that is thankfully more inspirational than alarmist, but it still feels like an extra rather than part of the series. And we get the expected, entertaining ten-minute 'Eye-to-Eye' making-of snippets at the end of each episode.

I only wish that they had included one episode on Madagascar in this series instead of padding it out to three episodes and a separate series (also produced by Gunton while he was filming 'Africa' hmm... why do I get the feeling that was a commercial decision?).

And yes, Attenborough narrates this one, is still in top form, and makes appearances in the Sahara desert, amongst other things. The man is a living monument. And yes, once again Discovery thinks that Americans want Attenborough replaced with an American, and no, I won't be bothering to check out their version. Even if he turns out to be good, why bother when you have Attenborough?

The picture and sound quality are amazing as always.

In short, I keep complaining about remakes, glossy sensationalism and screen-saver documentaries, but Gunton reminds us that nature is always surprising and always has something new up its sleeve, as long as you know where to look, and have the patience to find it (and catch it with the best equipment).",1362182400,72,4378,5.040110650069156
5414448,5,B00AF1H8D6,I watched this entire series when it aired on Discovery.  I was amazed and awed and captivated.  I thought I knew a lot about the continent.  This series taught and showed things I did not know.  I loved this.  I am so excited to be able to purchase it and keep it and share it later with my grandchildren and friends.  The photography will simply take your breath away.,1361577600,,370,4.2898550724637685
5414449,5,B00AF1H8D6,"The title for this review seems a bit much, but let me quickly explain why it's not hyperbole or meaningless oversell.  I help at my friends video store, which hosts a giant collection of Blu-ray features. I own many, but I should specify the only Blu-Rays I purchase, mostly due to replay-ability, are nature documentaries.  My modest collection boasts over 75 Blu-ray nature documentaries: BBC, Nat-Geo, Discovery and other independent sources. I've been collecting nature Blu-rays since the evening I installed a compatible drive in my computer.  The PC is linked via 1080p HDMI connection to a large LCD screen. The reason I'm telling you this personal information is so you know I'm serious about the genre. I'm critical. It takes a lot to blow me away since I've viewed so many astonishing, eye-popping nature documentaries over the years.  Other people collect guns, stamps or shoes. Well, I collect nature documentaries.

This is, without question, the best nature documentary ever made.

It's better than Life.

It's better than Planet Earth.

It's the reason why you should own a Blu-ray player and a high definition television.

I pre-ordered this series several months ago. Then, like a child waiting for his package to arrive, I eagerly paced my friends store for the delivery to be made yesterday. I'm an avid follower of anything David Attenborough produces -- a God for us nature doc enthusiasts. If you want to hear the highest degree of natural obsession, but described in as fascinating a way as listening to Indiana Jones tell tales of adventure, listen to Attenborough discuss filming on the extra interview footage, Disk 2. He'll give you a sense of where the genre as a whole has evolved from and how modern technology innovated how we study nature.  But the reason why this is so great isn't because Attenborough carries it. It's attributed to the iconic and innovative panoramic and close-up cinematography, the high resolution night-filming, spectacular ecological sequencing, detailed studies and harrowing biological dramas.

The series breaks-down six African regions: the Kalahari, Savannah, Congo, Cape, Sahara and a looking-ahead episode called the Future.  Among the intense biological attention, the crew follows most of the unique, rare and well-adapted African creatures, harvesting big questions and stirring the viewer into comprehending the vastness and the unfathomable diversity which exists on the mysterious continent.  One of the many incredible scenes in the first episode shows the worlds largest underground lake, beneath the unforgiving Kalahari desert. Attenborough describes how this lake contains a prehistoric fish species that exists nowhere else on the planet and how it survives in such ironic form. Another gem is the EXTRAORDINARY oasis scene, where a breathtaking array of beasts and fowl drink side-by-side at a life-saving watering hole. It's one of the most overwhelming scenes ever captured, I'm not kidding. A Garden of Eden, a bounty of lions, giraffes, ostriches, rhinos, and many other stoic animals all existing for the moment as a unified body.

The series showcases the high, mountainous and remote ""islands"" where creatures like gorillas and other primates live. Detailing how family dramas are tied to the treacherous struggles of survival in the rain forest.  You bare witness to the unique personalities and familial bonds, capturing intimate and rare once in a lifetime moments on camera.  You see when the normally introverted and temperamental rhinos come out at night, greet one another and foster relationships with friends. Yes, with friends. You hear how they communicate and witness the body language they present for each other, making it easy, as easy as sympathizing with another human, to understand what the rhinos are thinking. These moments echo throughout the series within various species.  It results in casting the beautifully special creatures with a sense of importance and individuality on the planet -- as equal as, and I say this with controversial trepidation, human populations struggle with the same belonging.

I never knew why giraffes had those two tiny horns on their heads before this series, which shows you why in glorious detail as the scene unfolds a cliffhanger moment into an uproarious Cinderella story. There are a few nail-biting, horrifying moments where in the last moment an event turns to favor the underdog, you never see it coming as you prepare to flinch and then you burst into tears and clap like a maniac.

Iconic sweeping panoramic landscapes fill the transitions between the micro-dramas. The vivid wildernesses offer glorious, endless wow-factor. You'll find yourself rewinding and re-watching scenes to maintain the tingly frisson, again and again. Earth-porn at its finest.

As usual, the BBC Concert Orchestra extends and resonates the visual majesty with a spectacularly swelling score.  The finest timing represented when the camera slowly creeps over a gaping precipice and the symphony builds into a shivering crescendo.

There are hilarious moments too, like the squirrel dropping its dinner with the kind of attitude and personality you expect from your best friend, he's registering he's been spotted by a leopard, and is about to bolt to his haven. The odd and personality-brimming giraffes are also sources of comic relief throughout Africa--they've quickly risen to be one of my favorite creatures on the planet, all thanks to this series.

It is completely worthy of your time. It has the capacity to change your feelings to favor preservation and natural conservation in all its forms without brow-beating you with guilt trips or ""humans are always a problem"" shaming.  Instead the series tactfully, and rightfully, admires nature and shows you why we should preserve these creatures, habitats and regions. And in that respect, showing is far more influential than telling.

Appropriate for all members of your family and offers a paramount-entrance into the revealing and worthwhile nature-doc collection. It's something every human on the planet should be required to see.  This is why you bought your Blu-ray player.  And if you do not own a Blu-Ray player, this is the reason you've been searching for to take the plunge.",1361577600,357,6267,5.266064257028113
5414450,5,B00AF1H8D6,"Africa is the latest incredible nature documentary from the producers who brought us Planet Earth, Life, Frozen Planet, and Human Planet. Africa is narrated by the great Sir David Attenborough. Unfortunately the Discovery Channel airing of Africa used a different narrator. This Blu-Ray is the original uncut broadcast with Attenborough. The Discovery Channel cut out scenes for commercials during the hour long broadcast when it aired.

Africa is a 6 part series which includes: Kalahari, Savannah, Congo, Cape, Sahara, and The Future. Each episode is stunning. From forest elephants to kick-boxing frogs, the animals of Africa come to life in stunning high definition. The cinematography in Africa is amazing. This is definitely one of the best BBC nature documentaries to date. This Blu-Ray is a must have for anyone who enjoys nature.",1361577600,72,838,5.348484848484849

5414469,5,B00AF1H8D6,"Terrific 6 hour documentary mini-series on the land and (mostly) animals of Africas various geographic regions; from the ocean waters off the Cape of Good Hope, to the stunning, endless Sahara desert.  Fantastically photographed, as all these BBC nature series tend to be, and hosted with his usual humanity, passion and insight by David Attenborough.  Its important to note that Attenborough is not just narrating, but he writes his excellent verbal sections himself.  Also, as with other BBC nature series, each of the 6 sections is accompanied by a mini making of documentary, which are often as fascinating and compelling as the main program.

Everything educational television should be.  Fun, moving, beautiful, full of new information you haven't heard or seen before, and reminding us of how important it is to save the amazing animals and wild places that strain under the ever heavier pressure of the demands of the human species..  Great for adults or any kids not too young to be frightened by occasional honest (and sometimes heartbreaking) examples of animal death in the wild.

They clearly didn't just give a high resolution camera to a couple of interns and ask them to film whatever they could in Africa. Cinematography, direction, and editing are first rate.

The 2-DVD set divides Africa into its major geographic ecosystems, and is a very entertaining tour of the uniquely wild and pristine swaths of land within this amazing continent. A ""making of"" third disc is included.

The fact that legendary naturalist David Attenborough is involved and is the narrator is the icing on the cake. He doesn't appear on screen as often as in the classic productions that he orchestrated in decades past, but he does appear occasionally and his voice and delivery are as captivating as ever.

Also they change from animal to animal so quickly that one does not have time to learn about the actual animals of Africa. I would recommend the PBS Nature documentaries (Nature: Extraordinary Animals) ESPICALLY  if you are going to be showing them to children. The PBS ones are realistic but not nihilistic like this unfortunate series. Oh also the PBS documentaries teach you not only about the animals but the people and the region.

I really like the end of each segment when personal stories are told about how the segment was filmed, what troubles they had, rewards, etc.

There are great extras too; interviews, deleted scenes, and outtakes. Highly recommended, you will discover unusual scenes such as lizards jumping on lions to catch flies. Giraffes battling!

5414570,5,B00AF1H8D6,"Epic cinematography, beautifully shot and wonderfully narrated by David Attenborough.  It does seem to cover more of the obscure life in Africa ass opposed to the large predators that we've seen in countless nature docs.  A few reviews complained about this but I don't need to see a Lion or Cheetah hunting a Wildebeast, I've been seeing that since I was a child, and it's fairly trite at this point. They do focus on some more things that you likely haven't seen or heard about before, such as a blind catfish that lives in complete darkness in an underwater lake with an unkown depth, Found in a crevasse underneath the Kalahari. This segment in particular is pretty awesome.

All of these may be why it is titled ""Eye to Eye with the Unknown"" We all know Big cats kill animals... any snippet on any nature channel will show you that, what's great here is the time taken to explore something new, such as Black Rhinos at night and how they behave much more loving and social than they are seen to do during the day.  This segment is only made possible by a new technology allowing them to film from distance at night and capture what looks like almost daytime, or at least full moon footage.

The footage I've seen so far is absolutely breathtaking and from my collection (frozen planet, planet earth, life, madagascar) this is definitely the highest quality footage I've seen.  Madagascar is pretty damn close but this takes the cake, there is a snip where they fly over some dunes in the kalahari (or possibly namib) and I cannot get this beautiful image from my head when thinking of this documentary.  If you are looking for quality and new subject matter concerning Africa, buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1421020800,,1716,4.643564356435643

5414598,5,B00AF1H8D6,"t is no secret that if you want to use your HDTV to the max, you attach a blu-ray player to it and then play one of BBC's nature documentaries. When I first upgraded to a HDTV in 2009, I watched Planet Earth, and it was an experience to behold and enjoy. When I upgraded to my new LG Plasma Display, I picked up Africa just to see.

What makes the BBC blu-rays so great is that they're made and formatted for the standard HDTV screen. Movies are formatted for the 1:37:1 aspect ratio rather than the 16:9 HDTV aspect ratio, and as a result when you watch a movie, you get black bars at the top and bottom of your image, which means that Baraka, for instance, while being mastered in 8K before being down-sampled to 2K, looks gorgeous, you don't quite get to make full use of your 1080p display compared to what Africa or Planet Earth provides.

Africa comes in 6 episodes, with 3 episodes per disk. Each episodes spans an hour, and covers the Kalahari, the Svannah, Congo, Cape, Sahara, and a wrap up episode that covers the bigger picture. Each episode comes with a behind the scenes section that's about 10 minutes long. The footage is nothing short of amazing, including Starlight cameras that reveal the nocturnal behavior of black rhinos, and a slow motion capture of a battle between 2 giraffes in a desert.

I'm normally very impatient with every ""behind the scenes"" documentary, because most of the time I'd watch them and say, yeah, you had a multi-million dollar budget, good for you. But some of the footage that the series provided were so jaw-dropping that I actually looked forward to the ""behind the scenes"" documentary. In one of the episodes, the crew shot silver ants in 50C heat in the Sahara desert, which looked brutal as heck.

I wasn't looking forward to he last episode, because normally these documentaries tend to be a huge downer. After all, nearly every non-insect species featured in the TV series is nearly about to go extinct (one good reason to own this Blu Ray). But the last episode was actually surprisingly optimistic, including detailing a huge multi-country plan to surround the Sahara with trees to prevent further desert incursions.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the series. Since you can't easily stream the series without losing video quality, the best way to enjoy it is to borrow it from a friend, rent it, or watch it over the air (though I'd be surprised if the presentation is better over the air than from a blu ray).

Highly recommended.",1412985600,2,2490,4.622171945701357

UPDATE. This series contains snippets of Africa's wildlife, though short, is very fascinating, well photographed, and excellent sound. The only complaint I have is at the end of each segment is a profile of the photographers and their experiences. This, IMO, should have been placed in the Special Features segment. It interferes with the flow of the superlative wildlife segments. By the way, most of wildlife segments could have been expanded into 1 hours episodes - the giraffe battle; the elephants enduring drought and death; the battle of the bugs and birds to name a few. Still well worth viewing.",1410998400,,777,5.377049180327869

Well worth the buy!",1410393600,,271,5.27906976744186
5414608,5,B00AF1H8D6,"The disc plays fine though I have not watched the full 2 discs but more or less skipped around.  OK, so what does that mean?

I purchased this set in a Daily Deal and read the reviews and like almost all the other BBC Earth Series discs, the ratings were very high.  Especially since David Attenborough narrates it.  I knew it would be good and I was not let down from what I have seen.

What I want to talk about though is the disclaimer that this disc will not play in most of the U.S. Blu ray Players as it is a region 2 disc and not region 1.  Meaning that it is made for European market and not for USA or Canada market.  When I ordered it, i did not see the disclaimer until it was being shipped.  I read about the video, the price and the comments from others.  Just like you are probably doing now.  The DVD version did not have the disclaimer but Blu ray does.  I figured it is i]on the way and not much i can do about it now.

It came in the mail today with another BBC Earth disc set I ordered and before unwrapping the cellophane/plastic, I compared the two sets on what was written on the back and looking for the region codes.  Both had similar written wording and nothing about regions, so I chanced it and opened it.  Needless to say, it worked as I stated above.  There was no problem with my player reading the discs and they played normally.  There is an area written stated the disc is distributed in the United States by Warner Home Video so I am not sure if these discs came out after the disclaimer was first put on under the description for this set or what, but I will say mine played well in my Sony Blu Ray player and in reading reviews, no one has mentioned this issue and I can only assume it is a non-issue or the other reviewers all live in Europe...which I doubt...LOL.  Hope this helps in your decision.",1410307200,3,1836,4.141242937853107

I have never seen nature photographed like this, hair-sharp and with lots of depth. Apart from the amazing photography, there are of course the unforgettable images of the fighting giraffes, the efforts of the tireless dung -beetle, the heart-rending images of the suffering elephants and so much more.

I think this is a nice touch and keeps it relevant to the footage you've just seen. I don't know if this special feature comes on the DVD but you just *have* to buy this in High Definition --- it's spectacular!!!

I would highly recommend this for any wildlife/nature show lover. The kids in my family (ages 8-14) are mesmerised by any of the Attenborough series. I would also recommend Life, Planet Earth and Frozen Planet --- if you've haven't already got them.",1389225600,,625,4.580357142857143

Sometimes it is too good to believe. 3D seems a bit odd.. seems as if it was not shot in real 3D but more faked by post processing. As some of the clips show (about how the video was made and what camera were used), it does not seem like stereo 3d cam rig was used.",1388880000,,331,4.1875

Despite a few scenes of rhinos and elephants congregating after dark,  there was unfortunately not enough footage of large African mammals like Lions, Leopards, Gorillas, or reptiles, such as Crocodiles, in this video.
A great deal of time in this series was devoted to smaller animals (ie- moles), birds and insects. When many of us envision watching animal life in Africa, we think of large mammals and carnivores, like the Lion, Leopard, Hippopotamus or elephant.
After all, it is these creatures that make wildlife in Africa so unique and beautiful.",1388188800,6,706,5.418181818181818

The photography is stunning and the dedication necessary to produce such work is remarkable and several natural events in the series have never been filmed before.  My only very minor criticism is the over-employed technique of creating stories, with anthropomorphic accents, within the structure of the film, some of which can only have been contrived and which are unnecessary.",1387929600,,532,4.966292134831461

I am extremely disappointed in the video's playback. It skips and buffers constantly making it impossible to watch. At first, I thought it was my internet connection, but I am able to watch videos on Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube in HD quality without any problems.

5414689,5,B00AF1H8D6,"Focuses on all the wonderful things in Africa, and is very informative. David Attenborough is brilliant as usual. Would watch it again.  Good one to add to my collection of nature documentaries.",1379289600,,194,5.0625
5414690,5,B00AF1H8D6,Just the kind of movie you expect from David Attenborough as narrator. This is wonderful to watch over and over.,1379116800,,112,4.65
5414691,3,B00AF1H8D6,"The best part of this DVD is of course David Attenborough's narration.  And if you could sit and listen to him just reading the phone book (as many of us would) then this film belongs on your must-have list.  But the material in the film is more of an augmentation to the Planet Earth series, than a stand-alone work about Africa.

There are moments of greatness: The mountain gorilla babys are cute for the minute these creatures are allocated.  And the desert Giraffe section is fantastic, as are the black rhinos, and elephants are always cool.  The film devotes much time to showcasing animals that are skipped by most nature videos: lizards, meercats, fruit bats, giant grass hoppers, ants, moles, unusual birds and many other creatures we never knew much about.  Perhaps...for good reason?

The footage of the Mountains of the Moon is disappointing, if you know what they are supposed to look like; these are just cloud shots with spectacular music. Granted, they explain they only had a month to film and weather wasn't on their side. But I hesitate to believe the BBC doesnt have the cash to return the crews when the weather is better to get the shots right. Not what one expects from the BBC.

I was also disappointed that the Erindi Ranch in Namibia appeared on the credits. How much of this film was made on a commercial game-farm with captive animals accustomed to humans?  Also Etosha Park, which is practically a petting-zoo.  I have similar footage on my cam-corder sitting in the parking lot. Not the effort one expects from the BBC.

The sound effects are exaggerated. It seems all animal sounds are dubbed with stock studio recordings. Example: I've never heard a small lizard make such crunching sounds when it moves in slow-motion on a rock, except Godzilla.  The lions running in slow motion with growling sounds in real-time contrasts oddly.  The ants moving to techno music?

The film set has 5 sections.  The first is called Kalahari (much is actually in the neighboring Namib).  Second is Savannah.  Third is Congo.  Fourth is Cape (as in South Africa). Fifth is Sahara.  The rest is making-of's.

Synopsis:  This film is certinaly not BBC's ultimate achievement in nature documentary.  Attenborough is extraordinary as usual and one never knows which film may be his last work.  Ironically, I find the 'making-of' at the end of each section to be the most entertaining parts. The film quality is very good in BBC style, its just not always of the most interesting subjects.  If you own the Planet Earth DVDs then this should be the next video to supplement the animals not covered in that series. But if you dont, then I predict one may be disappointed at what is missing.  A comprehensive collection of 'Africa' this video is not.  The question is, will you watch this film twice?",1379030400,22,2808,4.773858921161826

5414721,5,B00AF1H8D6,"Stunning is probably an understatement.
Wildlife films are often ""Serengeti-centric""; it takes real imagination and dedication to make a nature film about Africa with a fresh look.
Of course, the photography is superb - that's a given about BBC Earth. The story telling is no less compelling.
And with David Attenborough in the narrator's seat, there isn't much to desire.
I read in one of the reviews that Sir David Attenborough's narration was a minus.
For me, it was the other way around. Maybe it is because he has been at the helm so long, but I firmly believe the conviction and delight in his voice makes all the difference.
My only regret is that the show is a tad too short; I wish there were a few more episodes.

I can easily say I was not disappointed in the least!  BBC's Natural History Unit just keeps getting better, as impossible as that may seem.  And I can only hope that David Attenborough long continues to be up to the challenge, because he would be difficult to replace!

This production is stunning and a truly beautiful representation of an unappreciated continent.

Narrated by perennial favorite David Attenborough, and with impressive musical scoring, this tour of Africa is absolutely breathtaking.  Separated into six episodes, we are taken to the furthest reaches of the Kalahari, Savannah, Congo, Sahara and what many expect to be the future of Africa.

From all over the Dark Continent we are introduced, up close and personally, to animals of all types: elephants, and giraffes, insects, sea turtles, and sharks, birds, and even penguins.  We see the majestic beauty of Africa through exploding volcanos, vistas and peaks, ridges and cliffs.  The animals and lands of Africa come alive in astounding beauty and color.

5414755,5,B00AF1H8D6,"It is impossible to describe any BBC nature series without using the words ""stunning,"" ""breathtaking,"" ""moving,"" ""incredible"" and the like. Well-deserved words for any of their nature series, but doubly-so for Africa. Simply amazing!

This is a 6-part series that spans the continent, and is wonderfully narrated by David Attenborough (who continues to be at the top of his game). The photography, narration, pacing, and scope set the standards for nature shows - there is simply no comparison.

The featurettes after each segment are just as enjoyable as the episode, as the filmmakers review their approach and methods for key shots/scenes. That's my only quibble with the series - I would have very much enjoyed a more in-depth behind-the-scenes peak at how they accomplished all of the shots.  The third disk contains additional interviews and information but again, more please!!

One of the best nature series I've seen, and a HUGE recommendation. Get this!!

5414761,1,B00AF1H8D6,"I have not seen it, but to have a show called ""Africa"" - not ""Africa's wild life,' with a baboon on the cover can send a lot of mixed messages.  I can hardly find a large-scale documentary or film on Africa concerning the people, only the animals.  That tells you that they do not care about the people unless they are ancient Egyptians, which of course they try to disassociate from Africa.  They do not even like talking about Nubian, which of course gives the viewer the direct Africa link with Egypt, in case they are unaware otherwise.  Shameful message.",1364688000,11,559,4.56

5414767,5,B00AF1H8D6,"Attenborough and the Beeb have set the bar for nature docs for years now, and this one has notched that bar a little higher. Typically superb photography is combined with episodic critter ""dramas"" that play out like mini-Ibsen moments, and all of it made so much more compelling by Sir Attenborough's inimitable and unmatched narrative skills.

It's hard to overstate how much his voice-overs add to the BBC nature series he's on, and he's as good here as ever (almost six decades!). While watching some of these quickly disappearing species cavort across the screen, I couldn't help but think how sad it will be when David is also no longer with us. Others have tried to step up to his level, but you can clearly hear Attenborough's intense love of all of nature's creatures in a way that no one else has matched. You just know that this guy is deeply into everything you see, and that we might not have ever seen it without his impetus.

But along with Attenborough's dulcet tones we get a stunning array of dream-like images, some of which I still can barely believe are true. The Kalahari section is especially mind-blowing, such as seeing the world's largest underground lake and the species unique to that lake alone. Unlikely that any of us would ever see that in real life, or the wonderful midnight footage of rhinos mating, or at least trying to (that rhino was no R. Warthog). I have only seen the dvd of this, but can imagine that the blu-ray is incredible, as the colors and crispness of the dvd are almost as good as I've yet seen in that medium. If you have a BD player, definitely spend the extra five clams and get this in true hi-def.

One of the only quibbles with the dvds is the third bonus disc, which has less than an hour total on it, mostly interviews, and merely 6 minutes of unseen footage. I'd rather see another episode on that disc, os that it and the others could be a little less compressed. Too much wasted space on the bonus disc when all those good images could get more bandwidth.

The sound is also amazing, and while we watched this in the dark our Australian Shepherd/Siberian Husky lay beside us and kept tilting her head back and forth and watching intently as many animals she'd never heard before called out into the wild. She kept looking at us as if to say, ""Why aren't we climbing into that moving picture box to be with these strange creatures?"" If only. (The Truman Nature Show!)

The more perfect the picture, the stronger the message comes through: seeing dozens of disappearing species from tiny birds to massive rhinos and lions and giraffes all sharing a rare and vital waterhole is a sobering reminder that it's people who have the most trouble getting along with our neighbors on this planet. It's the ""lower species"" we should be learning from, not vice versa.

Attenborough and producer Gunton make that point repeatedly, and in many ways, most explicitly in the extras where Sir A talks about the many African species we have already extincted or are now about to destroy forever. And that's the greatest service these phenomenally fine BBC natures series are always trying to perform: waking up we homo saps to the consequences of our self-centered lives and habits, and how our daily choices of unsustainable energy sources and foodstuffs lead to the extinction of the habitats and lives of creatures halfway around the world from us.

We might never even see those critters, or consider how our lives impact theirs, if not for folks like Attenborough, Gunton and the producers at the BBC. And let us not forget the British taxpayers who fund these shows! It never fails to gall that a small island with a quarter the population of the USA keeps producing these stunning and educational series about our planet with public money, while we in the US get almost nothing close to this quality from our own publicly-funded PBS. Of course, those funds are always fading, as we wouldn't want to produce things that truly make us think about why our tax dollars are more involved in the destruction of these habitats than in their protection, now would we?

So thanks to the BBC for picking up our sad slack and helping remind us that there are many things more important than corporate profits. Our home and the creatures that were here long before us are easily more vital to surivival via biodiversity than our short-sighted lust for ephemeral ""profit"", and I love Attenborough and his friends for continually trying to remind the whole planet of this paramount fact.",1364342400,2,4523,4.687657430730479
5414768,5,B00AF1H8D6,"The series on Africa was terriefic.  The photography and the information on the topic were both breattaking and highly informative.

5414771,5,B00AF1H8D6,"The movie starts in the Kalahari Desert first, and uncovers things about the desert that most of us never knew. They also show one perfect scene where so many different animals have congregated close together by a rare source of drinking water. It almost reminds you of the biblical account of the Garden of Eden, with so many different animals getting along so peacefully, until a pride of vicious marauding lions suddenly appear out of nowhere and interrupted the peace. They looked crazed while even attacking each other, before chasing the other peaceful animals away. The show also highlights a group of desert Giraffes, and shows one Giraffe being knocked out in slow motion, by another Giraffe that was competing for a female Giraffe to mate with.

This documentary makes you feel that you're on an actual journey in Africa, all from the comfort of your living room sofa. It is much more than just the same old coverage about wildlife in Africa; this documentary is different because it gives you extensive detailed information about every region they visit. This film shows how the sand dunes in the Sahara desert, is constantly changing its shape in a time-lapse video replay. We also learn for the first time that there is a hidden underground lake in the Sahara Desert that is hundreds of feet deep, which may run the entire length of the desert.

From there the series takes us on a journey to the Savannah, and sheds light on the largest lava lake in the world. This is a six part documentary, and after every part is over they take at least another 10 minutes to explain how they made this series and the video shots they captured, which makes the series even more interesting. With the near perfect video shots, and the perfect lighting effects, this is what sets this film apart from others in the same naturalist field. This is another must have, for your collection of the BBC Earth Series documentaries.",1363824000,,1922,4.751497005988024
5414772,5,B00AF1H8D6,"I don't own a lot of blu ray movies but the ones that I do own, I own because I like to think they have good replay value.

There are 2 blu ray discs contain in the case.  There are 6 episodes in total - Kalahari, Savannah, Congo, Cape, Sahara and The Future.  Each episodes run time is approximately an hour long.  50 of those minutes is of the show while the last 10 minutes features Africa Eye to Eye where it shows the team in action and shows how they film some of those amazing scenes. There is also a code for a digital ultraviolet copy included.  The extras include - interviews, outtakes and deleted scenes.  Narration is done by Sir David Attenborough. The subtitles for the shows include English, French and Spanish.

The episodes themselves are absolutely gorgeous.  It may not be 3D but the vivid, rich colors shown in these six episodes really pop out.  If you are a fan of nature documentaries, you should definitely check this one out.",1363824000,,951,4.4508670520231215

After Planet Earth I was blown away and thought it couldn't get any better and was equally impressed by Frozen Planet.  Madagascar is incredible as are the Galapagos, and I've probably seen Wild Pacific 20 times now.

Even after countless hours of watching all of the above and others I was still glued to the TV for the entirety of Africa.  There are some disturbing and tear-jerking scenes, but as usual the production is incredible, the narration is perfect, and the footage is unsurpassed.  This is my new favorite!",1363219200,29,701,4.568

Don't think about it just buy it! :)",1362960000,2,378,4.053333333333334
5414779,5,B00AF1H8D6,"This documentary strikes a perfect balance between entertainment and education. The film shows events that have never been filmed before like an unforgettable fight between male giraffes over territory, which just sticks in my mind. This is like no other documentary I have ever seen. It concentrates more on the unique behaviors of animals by region as they interact with their own and other species. It shows some less well known animals and interweaves them with the more common ones by showing their dependence on each other, like lizards waiting for lions to sleep to catch flies off their faces. Unlike many documentaries, all the action here takes place against gorgeous panoramic terrain backdrops of endless blue skies, desert sands, and rain forests.

Some parts are funny, heart warming and make you feel like hopping a plane to Africa just to see all of this. Others scenes are so unique and amazing that you'll have to replay them just to believe what you saw. The 6th episode, ""The Future"" is more sobering as you realize that all of this great beauty and diversity could just cease to exist. There are also a couple stories that are sad and even distressing, where you wish the photographers would just do something. At the end of each episode are 10 minute ""Eye to Eye"" segments that explain how the filming was done.

Africat is as in depth as previous BBC series with more of a focus on animal behavior. It is well tied together with excellent and informative narrative and the video and audio will blow you away. It does not repeat footage from previous BBC series. The use of slow motion photography and outstanding macro work really show off HDTV capabilities and blu-ray technology and allow one to silently marvel at the form, adaptation, and splendor of these rarely seen in nature animals. David Attenborough is at the top of his game and while he appears in a some of the scenes his main function is as a trusted and familiar companion joining us on this magnificent adventure that was four years in the making.

NOTE: This series aired in January on the Discovery Channel but with a different narrator, Forest Whitaker. Some scenes were cut in order to allow for commercials and the length of the time slot.

UK RELEASE: This has also been released in the UK but as a 3 disc set with an UV and digital copy. It is also narrated by David Attenborough and contains the same 6 episodes. It appears that the episodes are just spread more across the 3 discs. I heard it contains the same extras BUT the run time is 15 minutes shorter than the  US version?

I really got to know how the geography affects climate and then life. I used maps of Africa to follow along. I found that helped a lot.
Some things to look for:
--Antelopes or gazelles running through a mountain gap during a change of topic.
--Drop of water on a leave acting as a lens through which you can see a flying insect.
--Social life of rhinos.
--Kite diving down captured from under water.
--Butterflies flying upstream to meet at a mountaintop.
--Many more.
