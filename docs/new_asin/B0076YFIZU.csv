8511339,5,B0076YFIZU,I bought this dvd set mainly to get a better budget label copy of Deep Red. I figured the widescreen listing could be a typo since most grey market releases of Deep Red were pan and scan. To my surprise it is in widescreen and it's also enhanced. The one difference is a title change from Deep Red to The Hatchet Murders. Also the new title is in blood red letters that look like they are intentionally dripping like blood. I have checked the quality on the other films in this set since The Hatchet Murders/Deep Red seemed to be what got me sold on this set.,1394236800,3,559,4.233644859813084
