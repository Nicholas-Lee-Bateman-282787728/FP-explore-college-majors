Three men race into town. They fire their pistols into the air, townsmen hide. [How many shots in a revolver?] A stranger in town is looking for Texas Ryan. Its his uncle Hank Younger. He wants Tex to return home to protect the ranchers from settlers; he does. A boy was hurt when he was run down by cattle men. Tex stops, he hears a shot, and is ordered away. In town men are armed with rifles. There is conflict, they need less violence and destruction. Tex agrees. Rand Lassiter greets Tex. Rand has plans to grab the lands because of this conflict. The shot brings the Sheriff. Tex rides to see Hank Younger, but he was murdered. Tex is in charge now. He stops the destruction of a fence, but asks for it to be taken down so cattle can access the water hole. A stranger eavesdrops, there is a chase with shooting for action. Lassiters men plan a raid on nesters tonight. Tex brings a warning to a nester.

Shots warn of the raid, shooting drives them away. The dead men are nesters. Why did they do it? The nesters blame the Halversons. Tex explains why Lassiter is behind this conflict. Tex will ride to Centerville and get the law. Lassiter makes his plans to take over after the nesters and cattlemen shoot each other. His daughter Sally begs Halverson not to go to town. Connors left a message for Tex. [Scenes of Tex on his galloping horse pad out the story.] Halverson tries to warn the nesters but if punched out. Tex arrives in town to confront Lassiter. The US Marshal appears to arrest Lassiter and his gang for their swindles. There are a few shots, Lassiter rides away. Tex pursues and captures him. Tex brings in his prisoner. The US Marshal will recommend Tex for Sheriff. As Sheriff he will have to deal with a family of nesters! He has a solution in mind.

The moral lesson from this story is to explain how this conflict harms both sides and will allow a crook to benefit from an unnecessary conflict. Is this still true today? Can a conflict over styles be used to divide people? Divide et impera is an old and true saying.",1507852800,,2072,4.404699738903394
