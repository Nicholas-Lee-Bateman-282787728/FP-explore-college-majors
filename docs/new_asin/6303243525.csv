7841644,5,6303243525,"This 52 min. video is an excellent general survey of snakes.  It covers all aspects of the natural history of snakes using a wide variety of snakes from all over the world as examples. It corrects popular misconceptions about snakes.  For example, constrictors suffocate, not crush, their prey to death.  The photography is outstanding.  To me the most spectacular and interesting sequences are the ones showing an African monitor lizard catching and eating a spitting cobra, an egg-eating snake eating a bird egg and regurgitating the egg shell, the interior of a prairie rattlesnake den, grass snakes hatching from their eggs, and grass snake embryos inside the unhatched eggs. I highly recommend this fascinating, factual, well-done video.",1030320000,4,742,5.316239316239316
