8022683,5,B00025LQVA,This is a really good video to watch if you are new to fitness and/or The FIRM. There is some very valuable information here. This video was filmed in the late 80s and was ahead of its time then. The information is still accurate and useful today.,1314835200,3,247,4.276595744680851

""Get the facts about weight loss and fitness - then use them to succeed in changing your body for the better!
In other fitness programs about 70% of exercisers drop out within 2 to 4 weeks! Why? Couch potatoes blame ""lack of discipline, time and/or money."" They're WRONG! Motivation comes from knowledge. Studies show that what people really lack are the basic scientific answers found in 20 Questions About Fitness. You can't count on health clubs for this information...This video offers proven solutions to all common figure problems, and exposes dozens of myths that even you believe. 20 Questions About Fitness has helped hundreds of thousands of people to get fit -- and stay fit for life!""
*Aerobic exercise is NOT the fastest way to lose weight
*Most effects of aging are reversed by weight training--at any age!
*Muscle does not ""turn to flab"" if you quit exercising.
*Special exercises, creams & devices sold to remove ""cellulite"" are all frauds.
*Weights will not give big muscles (unless male steroids are used).""

I would also recommend the Firm's ""Firm Points"" which demonstrates proper form and execution of the exercise moves so that you avoid injury and maximize your results.",1206489600,4,1208,5.0049751243781095
