460648,5,630241346X,"Rarely does Ms. Crawford make a bad picture in the 30's and this movie is no exception. In fact, ""Forsaking All Others"" was made during Joan's reign as box-office queen at MGM. This is one of the best films she ever made because her true abilities really shine. She plays a very beautiful socialite that falls for a man only to find out that he's really a cad. By the end of this classic ""talkie"" she finds out that the man of her dreams was always in her life. I love watching this movie because I like to pretend that the real world is really like this. If you're new to Joan Crawford films I strongly recommend this movie, as well as ""Sadie McKee"" another movie she made in 1934.",1176249600,7,682,4.253846153846154
460649,4,630241346X,"Forsaking All Others is Joan Crawford and Clark Gable's sixth film appearance together and while the plot is fairly formula stuff, Gable and Crawford, as usual, spark together.  Gable plays Jeff Williams, who is returning to New York from Madrid for the express purpose of confessing his lifelong love to Mary Clay, played by Crawford.  Problem is that Mary has been in love since childhood with Dillon Todd, played by Robert Montgomery.  Jeff has returned home on the eve of their wedding and upon hearing the ""good"" news, puts on a cheery face, spreads well wishes and prepares to walk Mary down the aisle.  (Talk about selfless!)  The night before the wedding, Dil carries the bachelor party festivities a bit too far and ends up marrying his former flame, Connie, who is every bit as hard as Mary is sweet.  It falls to Jeff to inform Mary, while dressed in her bridal gown, awaiting Dil's arrival at the church.  Mary goes on an extended sabbatical and returns to find that Dil is not happy in his marriage to Connie and is anxious to woo her back to his side, new wife nonwithstanding.  After many mishaps, Connie steps out of the picture, Dil and Mary's wedding is back on and Jeff finally declares his love for Mary.  Is there any question as to who she will choose?  Can anyone top Gable?

Watch for Billie Burke as Mary's Aunt Paula, Rosalind Russell as friend Eleanor and Charles Butterworth as Jeff's pal Shemp.

""You never got to give me away"" Mary tells Jeff ""That's all right with me"" he says, but she still doesn't get it.  She starts seeing Dil again on the sly, much to Jeff's disgust, but after a lot of misunderstandings and mishaps she finally realises that she really loves  - well, I don't suppose it will come as a surprise to you.  This could have been a melodrama, but instead is a very funny comedy, the stars banter cheerfully among themselves even in the midst of passion.

460654,4,630241346X,"This 1934 romantic comedy is a delight. With its trio of star performers, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, and Robert Montgomery, it does not miss. Its success is also fueled by the comedic talents of the stellar supporting cast led by Charles Buttersworth, Billie Burke,  Francis Drake, and a very young Rosalind Russell.
Three childhood friends, Mary Clay (Joan Crawford), Dil Todd (Robert Montgomery), and Jeff Williams (Clark Gable), form the nucleus of the film. Jeff has just returned from Spain where, after a two year stint, he has made his fortune and is on his way to propose marraige to Mary Clay, the girl he has loved ever since he was a boy. Unfortunately, he arrives on the eve of her wedding to Dil Todd, their other childhood friend, the three of them having grown up together.
Jeff, stunned by the news, puts on his best face and congratulates the two. Fortune smiles upon him, however, when the foolish Dil jilts Mary, leaving her on the altar, and marries a former flame. Too late, Dil realizes that he has made a mistake, as he still loves Mary. This leads to a series of screwball, madcap situations, in which Jeff comes to the rescue. The path of true love does not run smoothly in this drawing room style comedy.

All this in addition to the fact that the print used is a very bad one. TCM airs a better print than this, miles superior! What happened? I should return this.",1366243200,3,599,4.357142857142857
460765,4,630241346X,"Forsaking All Others is an entertaining comedy with some drama as well; and the acting is extremely convincing! The choreography and cinematography are both very good, too. The musical score could have been cut slightly here and there; sometimes it's the type of music that tells you how to feel! In addition, the plot moves along well but they could have cut a minute or two here and there to tighten up the action.

When the action starts (and there's lots of it), sweethearts Dillon ""Dill"" Todd (Robert Montgomery) and Mary Clay (Joan Crawford) are just about to be wed when Dill leaves Mary at the altar to marry his old flame Connie (Frances Drake). To make matters even more complicated, Mary's old pal Jeff ""Jeff"" Williams (Clark Gable) returns from Spain just before Mary was to marry Dill; he wanted to propose to Mary but didn't know she was marrying Dill! Much to Jeff's chagrin he realizes that Mary is spoken for. Jeff handles this rather well; he hides his feelings for Mary and even agrees to give her away at the wedding! After Mary is deserted at the altar by Dill, Jeff tries to make her forget Dill for her own good--and perhaps also to get Mary for himself.

But after Mary is jilted by Dill, she really isn't thinking about Jeff as a potential husband. Mary is simply devastated and remains in love with Dill although she pretends that she isn't; at the same time Dill realizes that Connie isn't what he thought she'd be as a wife--Dill now wishes he married Mary instead of Connie.

Of course there's much more to the plot but I want to avoid giving out spoilers so you can enjoy this film as much as I did! The rest of the film shows how all the issues work out and it's very entertaining with quite a few amusing situations not to mention some problems.

Look also for solid performances by Billie Burke as Mary's Aunt Paula; Charles Butterworth as ""Shemp"" and Rosalind Russell as Eleanor. Arthur Treacher plays Johnson, Dill's butler and Harold Huber has a cameo as the owner of a hamburger stand.

460766,4,630241346X,"Forsaking All Others is one of my favorite Clark Gable films, although admittedly it gets rather lost in the plethora of great films he made, especially the legendary Gone With the Wind, It Happened One Night, and Mutiny on the Bounty.  Jeff Williams returns from overseas and informs his friend, Shemp, that he finally intends to propose to the woman he has secretly loved for years, Mary Clay, only to be informed that she is engaged to his best friend, Dillon Todd, the man she has secretly loved for years. Wanting her to be happy, he keeps silent about his feelings, even when Dillon leaves Mary standing up at the alter in order to marry his old flame, Connie Barnes, even when Dillon and Mary begin an affair. Clark Gable gives a sweet, sensitive performance that is alternately funny and heartbreaking; it is actually one of his best. Robert Montgomery is hysterical as the cad, Dillon, who seems to be somewhat out of touch with reality. Charles Butterworth is quite droll as Shemp, and his character is given the best lines in the film. Billie Burke gives another solid performance as a ditz with a heart of gold, Aunt Paula. Frances Drake plays the snotty and spoiled Connie as oily and manipulative, the kind of character you love to hate. This was one of many films made by Clark Gable and Joan Crawford, and it is obvious why they were such a popular and successful duo - they sizzle together! This film, along with No Man of Her Own, are two of my favorite Gable films. For me, Gable's post WWII body of work simply doesn't compare to his pre-war films, and that is because they lack the riveting sex appeal he displays so well in his earlier work.

460768,4,630241346X,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""FORSAKING ALL OTHERS"" (1934) (84 min/B&W) -- Starring: Robert Montgomery, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Charles Butterworth, Billie Burke, Frances Drake, Rosalind Russell

Directed by W.S. Van Dyke

The plot is as follows: -- Dillion (Robert Montgomery) leaves Mary (Joan Crawford) standing at the altar in order to marry his old flame, Connie (Frances Drake), instead. Knowing that Mary still has feelings for Dillion, Jeff (Clark Gable) keeps quiet about his own love for her.

The screenplay is a pretty good one, mainly because the cast of players make the story work in a light yet believable way even when the story becomes somewhat silly and even predictable.

Also of note is an early appearance by Rosalind Russell in a short role later in the film.

Robert Montgomery in a dress is really funny, Good performances by Crawford opening shot with cream on her face is in contrast to other stars who preferred glamorous introductions, Clark Gable as usual is great, Billie Burke who can do ""flustered"" any better, Rosalind Russell does well in one of her early films and a very droll Charles Butterworth. Frances Drake was believable as the lower class wife.

Montgomery was one of the first to have a dramatic television series, ""Robert Montgomery Presents"" (1950), won the Emmy as the Best Dramatic Program of 1953.

W.S. Van Dyke is the director of this film, and he knew how to combine sexual tension and comedy in an age of aggressive censorship, and this is a fine example of his work, which should get more attention than it has.

Special footnote: -- The original play opened in New York City, New York, USA on 1 March 1933 and had 110 performance. Tallulah Bankhead played Mary Clay and the cast included Ilka Chase, Barbara O'Neil, Cora Witherspoon, Fred Keating, Anderson Lawler, Harlan Briggs and George Lessey.

460769,5,630241346X,"Joan Crawford stars with two of her best leading men, Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery. Gable, with whom she had an affair and co-starred with in 8 films, is in true form here, alternately charming and comedic, spilling over with energy and personality. Although we know him best for being the primary love interest, he is excellent as the second choice who pines away secretly in the wings. Robert Montgomery pales in comparison, but he too is quite good as the primary interest. Crawford and Montgomery paired in 6 movies, and he proved to be a charming and effective leading man.

Crawford is Mary Clay, a beautiful and wealthy young woman who is set to marry her childhood crush, Dyl(an  Montgomery). The day before her wedding day, most of her friends are in town to celebrate, and the list is completed when Jeff (Gable) comes home from business overseas just in time. Unbeknownst to her, Jeff plans to propose to Mary, who he has loved from afar since childhood. Luckily she breaks the news before he embarrasses himself, and he stands behind her whole-heartedly.

Unfortunately for Mary, things aren't that easy, and Dyl runs out on her on their wedding day. Devastated but trying to put on a brave face, Mary does her best to recover, and Jeff does his best not to do anything foolish.

This film was made during the prime of Crawford's career, when she was at her most beautiful. It is dripping with melodrama and old fashioned mores, just like I like 'em. It almost seems old fashioned for the year it was made, 1934, feeling more like something from the 1920s. The scene where Jeff arrives home seems like a soundie remake of a party scene in Our Dancing Daughters, and the plot involving wealthy childhood sweethearts in a love triangle sounds like a typical piece of 20s Broadway fluff.

If you're a fan of nostalgia, melodramas, or any of these stars, this film is a must.",1314576000,,1888,4.674698795180723

I love Joan as much as anybody else, but as we all know Joan COULD NOT do comedy! Just look at for example""Love on the Run- a cheap rip-off of ""It happened on night"" She was funny in ""The Women"". And even more of a delight IMO(as a comedian-see my review) in  ""Dancing Lady"".Her often unintentional camp masterpieces from the 1950's are good for many laughs too:)

Clark Gable we all know is an excellent comedian, etc RR,BB and the everyone else applicable....Joan spoke favorably of this one if the book""Coversation with Josan Crawford"",,,the coup of being written by Joseph Mankiewiecz is alluring and promising as well,but this one  just didn't gel well with me!

460771,5,630241346X,"[I haven't seen the DVD.  I wrote the following after seeing a broadcast on Turner Classic Movies.  Don't read this if you don't want to read a plot summary.]

A romantic comedy with Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery, and Clark Gable, Forsaking All Others (1934) dates from the glorious era when screen comedies were adapted from Broadway plays, and The Word rather than The Visual Effect was still the heart of the drama.  In short, this period piece consists of lively repartee and glorious one-liners.  (Montgomery on lighting a fire: ""I don't need a match.  I can just rub two boy scouts together."")  In that sense, screen writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz (or his source, playwright Edward Barry Roberts) deserves top billing rather than director W.S. Van Dyke, whose credits include four of the Thin Man movies.

Mary (Crawford), Jeff (Gable), and ""Dill"" (Montgomery) grew up together near the Adirondacks in the idyllic state of nature known as childhood.  Mary has always been in love with Dill, while Jeff, unbeknownst to Mary, has always been in love with her.  Played to perfection by the incomparable Montgomery, the lovable Dill, who is the screwball in this screwball comedy, has never really grown up, while Jeff takes adulthood seriously.  Habitually finding himself in an avuncular role, Jeff is forever getting the other naughty children out of scrapes.

When the film opens, Jeff has just returned from Spain determined to propose to Mary, only to discover that she's engaged to be married to Dill.  Ever afraid of responsibility, Dill abruptly elopes with a woman with whom he had a fling in Paris, only to realize what a terrible mistake he's made: he can't live without his childhood playmate, Mary, or their enchanting world of play.  Dill and Mary are soon meeting secretly, she against her own better judgment, while Jeff finds himself covering up their indiscretions with increasing annoyance.  All ends well when Dill divorces his wife . . . and Mary leaves him at the altar for Jeff, choosing adulthood over ""childish things"" when she finally realizes who has been the more reliable friend.",1277769600,,2111,4.991428571428571
460772,5,630241346X,"This is a Warner Archive product. It is a simple DVD-R with no chapter stops and no extras. You can go backwards and forwards in ten minute increments only. The case is sturdy and the artwork passable. I am not debating the wisdom of paying this particular price for the product.

This is one of the several movies that Joan Crawford made with Clark Gable, and fortunately quite a few of them (maybe all) have made it to at least DVD-R via the Warner Archive. This is one of the best the two did together. It's a romantic comedy in which Joan plays socialite Mary Clay, who is about to marry lifelong acquaintance Dillon Todd (Robert Montgomery). Clark Gable plays another of Mary's lifelong friends, Jeff Williams. Jeff has been long away from home and decides to come back just to ask Mary to marry him, unaware that Mary is about to marry Dillon. When he learns about their upcoming marriage he decides to keep his feelings to himself. Robert Montgomery is playing the usual harmless playboy character here that he did so much of in the early 1930's. It looks like Mary and Dillon's marriage is about to go off without a hitch when one of Dillon's old girlfriends appears on the scene.

This film was released about six months after the precode era ended, so there is nothing really racey going on here. About the most extreme thing you will see is Robert Montgomery in a dress. However, W.S. Van Dyke is the director of this film, and he knew how to combine sexual tension and comedy in an age of aggressive censorship, and this is a fine example of his work. I highly recommend it to fans of films of the 1930's.

As for the audio and video quality, the film looks and sounds quite good. There has been no restoration done for this specific release, so you'll see a few specks here and there in the video, but overall I was quite satisfied.",1250985600,5,1845,4.468842729970326

460774,5,630241346X,"In 1934 the year this film came out Joan was in 2 other pictures, ""Sadie McKee"" and ""Chained"", all with similar plots. And all are fantastic movies. I would love it if Warner Bros. released a special boxed set with these 3 movies and added some special features.

In ""Forsaking All Others"" Joan doesn't play the little shop girl; instead she's '30s high-society, with maids and butlers and living in the lap of luxury. Yet even though she is the reining den mother of Park Ave, we also get to see Mary's (Joan's character) softer side as she is jilted at the alter!

There's a lot of comedy, humor and subtle repertoire in the picture, as well which makes it even more enjoyable to watch because as any fan of Joan's films knows not all of her movies have this characteristic.

""Forsaking All Others"" has always been one of my very favorite pictures with Joan. Because it is the perfect movie and love story with a strong cast who all gave exceptional performances. Besides Joan's out-of-this-world performance, the movie also includes these very talented stars: Clark Gable (as Mary's old friend, Jeffy), Billie Burke (as Mary's aunt), Robert Montgomery (as Dillon who left Mary for another woman), Frances Drake (as Dillon's new wife, Connie) and Rosalind Russell (as Eleanor).

This movie will remind you that sometimes love is where you least expect it and sometimes we need to stop worrying so much about the little things. Because as Rosalind Russell says: You worry more about something to worry about than you worry about an actual worry.

7825459,2,630241346X,"From the beginning, Forsaking All Others sputtered down the road at a tedious pace on a sludge of sophomoric prattle, annoying pratfalls, and many other shamefully obvious signs that this film was the rushed-through-the-mill product of a 2nd rate writer and a director who was apparently distracted by preparations for a more important project.  While Chained was a beautifully written, elegantly staged, and wonderfully well-performed delight in which Gable and Crawford masterfully drew me into their characters and their story,   unfortunately, these two beloved screen sensations were not provided with such a vehicle on the set of Forsaking All Others.  Matter of fact, I recommend that the film be retitled Forsaking Most Priorities.",1463875200,,739,5.513274336283186
7825460,5,630241346X,"This movie did not disappoint me. I was craving a serving of delicious Clark Gable served up with a side of creamy Joan Crawford. I've probably watched this on amazon instant video three times already because I just can't get enough!

The madcap wealthy socialites of the thirties dominate here. So many scenes between the characters Connie and Mary end up with at least one woman showing her claws. For once, there are allusions to sexual adventures even though the male characters are perfect gentlemen. A scene with a hairbrush reminds the modern viewer that you could be gentlemanly and still play the tough father-figure; my, how times have changed.

Joan Crawford has never looked quite so beautiful as in this movie. She has never been one of my favorite actresses but watching her in this role, I can see how she makes it into the top tier for many people.

I can't help but notice that Robert Montgomery has a unique charm that I see today in Greg Kinnear. But Greg Kinnear still would suffer in any comparison.",1455321600,,1020,4.687150837988827
