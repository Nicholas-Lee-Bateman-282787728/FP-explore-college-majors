7903756,4,B0000067P5,"Though offering information and footage on a number of Russian fighters, this edition of a series on the Soviet air power concentrates on the MiG-21, the Russian designed, single-engine fighter that appeared in the mid `50s and hasn't disappeared since.  Produced in larger numbers and in more countries than any supersonic jet in the world (8000 built in the USSR alone, not counting the licensed and unlicensed Chinese copies), and influencing the designers of western warplanes, the MiG-21 may be the most prolific design in the world.  Basically a small delta-winged interceptor with one engine, the MiG went against the grain of conventional wisdom (both in the west and the Soviet bloc) of producing larger and more complex fighters.  Taking precedence over the less glamorous but more promising MiG-19 (which had two engines and a revolutionary control system which this documentary compares to an early attempt at fly-by-wire), the MiG-21 took the world by storm.  It was small and light, and more maneuverable than western analysts wanted to admit.  Though suffering numerous design deficiencies (poor armament, range and survivability), Vietnam war era debated the merits of the design.  Though called the Phantom's foe for its confrontations with American F-4 aircrews, the long life and popularity of the MiG-21 has ensured that it would face aircraft of numerous countries over several eras, whether Israeli Mirage jets of 1967, or American F-16 drivers in Desert Storm.  Constantly upgraded, the documentary tells us that Red Air Force designers exhausted the alphabet attempting to classify every last variant of the MiG-21.  In the west, planners who had pined for larger and more complex jets, now set their sights in smaller jets like the F-16 and the F/A-18.  (Compare the hulking Swedish JA-37 Viggen with its successor, the JA-39 Grypen).  The Mig-21's handling, also ultimately derided by the west, influenced their training which had initially dismissed dogfighting skills in favor of all-missile air warfare tactics.  Against the MiG's short-turning radius, high rate of turn and instantaneous turn-rate, such tactics proved shortsighted in the skies over Vietnam and led to programs like Top Gun and Red Flag.  So high performance was the MiG, that its place as a dogfighter wasn't superceded until the advent of the MiG-29 in the early 1980's, nearly 30 years after its debut.  (The Mig-21's successor, the MiG-23 was designed as a missile-interceptor with high speed and limited dogfighting capabilities).
This documentary effectively tells the MiG-21's story, though I would have preferred more anecdotes from MiG-21 pilots (the series seems underwhelming when getting the pilots' stories).  Also, though mentioning the Chinese MiG's - like the J-7, it does little more than that even though such jets had reportedly fought in the 79-89 Persian Gulf war.  Also, too little of the series' attention is given to lesser known aircraft like the Su-9, which has the same general configuration as the MiG-21, but is much larger.  Such aircraft will remain mysteries.  Also undertreated is the Su-7, which was to ground-attack what the MiG-21 was to dogfighting.  That airplane is mentioned in another edition dealing with swing-wing aircraft like the MiG-23, but is still a footnote.  Like the other episodes, this one has Peter Ustinov's smooth narrative, one bound to make the surrounding Soviet context, with its grandiose schemes, flavor every historical detail.  For its flaws, another great entry into an uncommon series.",991612800,2,3549,5.326164874551972
