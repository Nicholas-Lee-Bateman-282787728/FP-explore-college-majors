1889131,1,B00009RGBG,"I read reviews about this film before purchasing. But this movie was not in the least bit romantic. It was more like two head-cases got together to mess with each other. I have seen many foreign films and many lesbian films and lesbian foreign films and this movie was just awful. Here's an example: the women deceive each other, lie to each other, and they have some words in a bit of an argument. Cut to the next scene where inexplicably they are in the bath together. This leaves the audience scratching their heads. If they had cut to some hot makeup sex scene, I may have gone along with it, but this confuses the audience, leaves us wondering if a big chunk of the story was cut out. We really don't get a good idea of what motivates the characters to behave the way they do and at the end of the day, evidently neither woman is really a lesbian. It's not even about getting even for a previous hurt. And I cannot imagine why or how the dental-prosthetician (boyfriend) can be so loving and so supporting instead of kicking her butt to curbside checkout at the first sign of her deceit (thinly veiled and blatant).
Don't waste your time. If you want a nice love story, try Entre Nous (French with English subtitles).",1312243200,18,1222,4.435555555555555

1889265,1,B00009RGBG,Horrible  movie. It leaves you expecting more and more but nothing happens. Both women are crazy. Not sure why a lot of these so called foriegn lesbian movies portray women who are not lesbians at all and will sleep with a man at the drop of a hat. A sure waste  of  time.

1889266,4,B00009RGBG,"I lived in France for 13 years as I choose French movies, especially those that I have not heard of, because I like their cynical view of life.  I have watched about 6 Amazon prime movies in the last 6 months and two of them were fairly good (Four of the films were unwatchable, featuring violence and self destructive characters).  Repetition featured some good actors, especially Emmanuel Beart, and had the real flavor of France at the beginning of this century.  The story was engrossing and the film quality was good.  La Repetition was a pleasant surprise.",1438214400,4,562,4.762886597938144

1889268,2,B00009RGBG,"It was too long, waiting for something more to happen.  The French seem to have difficulty ending their movies.  They seem to reach a point when they run out or tire of the story and people literally just walk away from each other, signalling, no doubt, that it's time to leave the theater, if you hadn't realized it long before.",1437177600,,329,4.466666666666667

7992861,1,B00009RGBG,"I am reviewing to raise awareness on the issue of cinematic homophobia. All the people who are giving positive reviews to this film may not be familiar LGBTQA+ film history. If that's the case then it's understandable how this regurgitation can seem like refreshing realism. After all it's like being a tourist in a country where everything is new to the tourist even though it's all been there for more than a thousand years. The irony is that, far from being refreshing, this film is mired in archaic representations of homosexuality.

It's too easy for writers and directors to be daring with characters and social identities that they don't actually understand or empathize with and which are degrees removed audience empathy as well. We found out the tragic way that this kind of empathy in media is important. Thankfully films stopped depicting suicide as the only thing left for LGBTQA+ people.

In short this film is nothing but a checklist of every horrible anti-lesbian trope...

MAJOR SPOILERS:
Attempted suicide? Check.
Extra-marital affair? Check.
Over-the-top destructive obsession? Check.
Toying with each other in sick ways? Check.
Killing / Almost killing object of obsession? Check.
Implication that heterosexual sex is more passionate and fulfilling? Check. (i.e. ""I'm only happy when he's ****ing me."" Actual line from the film)
...while lesbian sex is so soft it's almost non-existent? Check.
Noticeable void of genuine love, tenderness, caring, interest in partner/lover's well-being? Check.
Pretentious art film style to justify the homophobia like a bad perfume trying to cover the poop stench in the bathroom? Check.
Selectively ""realistic"" only for LBTQA+ films? Check.
...and even then only ""realistic"" in ways that support abusive stereotypes? Check

You could pick any random lesbian film and play Cinematic Homophobia Bingo with how often these little ""realistic"" tropes happen to popup. Healthy or positive relationships are the unicorn of lesbian films just like non-happy endings are rare for heterosexual films.",1498867200,3,2045,5.38125
7992862,4,B00009RGBG,"Shame this doesn't reach some kind of conclusion despite the titles obvious underpinnings. Be that as it may I thought it was an excellent movie and were it not for several gripes I had with it; easily had the potential for a five star review in my honest ""opinion"" though of course in all honesty it may very well also be due in part to my biases when it comes to lesbians in cinematography and the lack thereof; of a distinctive narrative. The first of which being the lack of discerning or at the very least exploring a little more of just what exactly was it that kept these two apart; despite one parties obvious inability to even acknowledge feelings that they both knew existed. I really feel they didn't do enough to clarify this to the audience. I mean was it the fear of being persecuted? Was it the inability to accept love because of some self hating deeply rooted issues that Natalie harbored? was it her unwillingness to commit in an attempt to save Louise from herself? I'm really interested in others interpretations as I can only speculate even upon completion of the movie.

Which leads me again to its ending. It relied so much on keeping you in the dark and drawing your own conclusions, which while understandable given the context of this film: fails to shed more light into the issues even as the movie inherently approaches its climax. Which sufficed to say left me with more questions then I did initially while watching it.

Last but not least while it doesn't influence much of how I rate a film; to say that a happy ending doesn't affect my rating at all would be pretty disingenuous mainly due so in part because it is a rare commodity in the world of lesbian cinematography to have one and so this repetitive (ironic) trends tends to get a bit frustrating at times. I sincerely think it had very strong potential for an instant classic and worth adding to my collection, but failed to deliver a conclusive final product in the end.",1496966400,,1961,4.552407932011332

7992868,3,B00009RGBG,"The title is the biggest clue to this movie's theme. This is a story of unrequited love warring with unhealthy boundaries. The two women in this tale are childhood friends. One was very serious and conservative and the other basing her value on other partners. This causes the ladies to go their separate ways. The scene cuts abruptly 10 years from the last. One is settled down while the other enjoys fleeting moments of bliss entangled in bitterness. Always the serious and compassionate friend, the stable woman tries to help the other get on her feet and realize her potential. She gets hurt and leaves. This is repeated. It becomes a cycle as the stable one is drawn in by her first love and left hurting each time while the other is unaware of the damage she inflicts trying to sort herself out.

Overall, the story is a familiar one driven by the characters' development. I was drawn in for the mental aspects of the characters. The message is still there: you can't change anyone. Kudos for trying but someone probably got hurt in the process.",1476489600,6,1051,4.650537634408602
7992869,5,B00009RGBG,"This isn't your typical ""let's all love one another and ride off into the sunset happy"" flick. It is beautiful in it's realism and pain. If you have ever loved and lost, lost everything including your own sense of identity, and remember the pain of finally giving up and walking away, then you will understand the highs and lows of this movie. It is happy, sad, painful, and glorious, and it can bring you to your knees.",1476144000,5,420,4.467532467532467
