8012716,2,B0001HMCBC,"This is not the best version of ""The Fixer."" The Alan Bates/Dirk Bogarde version is the best--when will they put the superior version on DVD? I saw the original movie version of the Bernard Malamud novel during the sixties. I have it on VHS. The great Alan Bates and Dirk Bogarde were excellent, and the entire cast was also great, e.g., Ian Holm, David Warner, etc. Please put the original ""The Fixer"" on DVD! Also, get David Warner and Ian Holm to do commentary.",1230854400,11,464,4.535714285714286
