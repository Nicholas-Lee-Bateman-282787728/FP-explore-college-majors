Rx this movie for every pre teen and early teen. Story teaches worth is not based on age but on what one is willing to do, willing to try and the acceptance of his or her responsibilitys that will both determine and show a persons true character.",1369958400,2,381,4.352112676056338

1643742,5,B00005Q2YV,"Found this movie quite by accident while looking for anothe rmovie with a similar title.  But it  was a good mistake.  Great movie, audience age probably 4th grade up to 9th grade and easy to understand, great plot and happy ending despite al l the challenges the characters face. Shows kids how life has both good and bad things happen and that people can survive anything.",1344729600,4,374,4.636363636363637

1643885,4,B00005Q2YV,"Lovely sweet story; however, disappointed in the film makers.  My goodness they kept hauling the manure spreader around trying to pretend they were doing field work with it.

Great for city audiences who want a little taste of country with a heart-warming story woven in.",1447372800,,389,4.7611940298507465

1643971,5,B00005Q2YV,"It was very enjoyable movie showing one of the main characters changing slowly to a loving, caring Grandpa. There was action and suspense as they were pursued by a bear and then made their way back down the mountain.  The teenager showed kindness and patience making it easy for his grandfather to love him and get over years of bitterness.  I would recommend this movie to all who enjoy a good slow-paced movie where facial expressions and tone were as important as the dialogue.

1643999,4,B00005Q2YV,The only dislike was that the audio came first then several seconds the actual mouth movement came later. Was akward to watch while looking at the people talk after a scene had already taken place. Other than that enjoyed the movie.,1419811200,,232,4.682926829268292

It is a good family movie in that it is exciting, but is also clean and has some human interest mixed in.  I gave this movie a one-star review because about fifteen minutes or so into it, the audio is about two seconds behind the picture.  So distracting!  I would, however, recommend this movie if you think you can live with it.",1413676800,2,406,4.373333333333333

That's my second criticism. The film is stereotypical and predictable. They don't develop a few key charachters, and it's the same old, tired, shallow, racism thing.",1407110400,3,433,5.185714285714286

1644025,5,B00005Q2YV,"Taking place in 1977, a city boy with an active imagination gets a strong dose of reality when his mother passes away and he has to live with his grandparents on the farm. His mother's father (played brilliantly by Michael Ansara) with hatred of Native Americans is a bitter pill for Seth (played equally brilliantly by T.J. Lowther) to swallow, now that he knows he is half Indian on his war hero deceased father's side. Plus, adjusting to farm work when you have a tendency to daydream can have it's pitfalls as Seth soon finds out.

Seth's grandmother is a wonderful, sweet character with one of the film's greatest lines (regarding flowers) and just thrilled to be able to have Seth live with them despite her husband's protestations. A girl his age from the farm down the road provides Seth with more to do than back-breaking chores by teaching him to ride a horse, much to the dismay of his grandfather at first. A nearby Indian farmer holds secrets to Seth's past that won't exactly be a surprise to the average viewer, but how the secrets are delivered over the course of the film is a credit to the filmmakers' ability to hook you with interesting plot development and weave a proper web of a yarn.

The Long Road Home is a sensational film filled with life lessons and a truly heartfelt story that quickly endears you to the characters and is entertaining and satisfying to the last frame of it's great finale. It is a rare thing to find such an excellent modern family film (it's from 1999) with so much heart and beauty. It is indeed a long road home for Seth and his grandpa, but a more satisfying journey is difficult to find. You're going to want to watch this one and recommend it a LOT. 5++ stars",1405209600,29,1713,4.504823151125402

1644049,4,B00005Q2YV,"I watched this first on Prime; however, it seemed blurry when I moved it to full screen on my computer ... so I got in on Netflix, which offered a much sharper image full screen (Prime was fine if you wanted to watch the 4x4"" display).  I don't know if the fault lies with my computer or not ... so I am NOT downing Prime!!  At least I could tell I wanted to watch an improved version.

Anyway, it's an OK story.  Gorgeous photography.  Lots of moral points can be drawn and lots of life lessons can be pointed out if you watch it with younger members of your family.  I don't want to BUY it (having no younger family members), but I certainly did ENJOY it!  Michael Ansara sure looks different!!",1374624000,3,696,4.2272727272727275

7949575,5,B00005Q2YV,"I loved this movie.  Seeing Michael Ansara again in a leading role was a real treat.  The story was real,  portraying an angry grandfather who disapproved of his daughters marriage and consequently couldn't warm up to her son.  The boy suffered so much loss in his life and he didn't understand what he had done to make his grandfather so mad.  With the help of neighbors, who were keeping secrets of their own, the two learn to trust and love one another.  Al Harrington as one of the neighbors was also a treat.
