2760649,5,B000N818K0,"My daughter is special needs and couldn't speak until Hip Hop Baby came into her world.  We play it all day long and even got the CD to play in the car and bathroom during bathtime.  After 1 day, she started singing her ABC's; after 3 weeks, she is now counting to 10 and understands the concept 1, 2, 3!  This video has helped her focus and there is something about these children, combined with the rhythm which is THE perfect combination.  I've recommended this product to all of my daughter's therapists as well as anyone else.  Whether your child has issues or not, this is a fantastic 'kid must-have!'",1217462400,,607,4.4818181818181815
2760650,5,B000N818K0,My three-year-old never gets tired of watching this video. She loves to dance and sing along with the kids on the screen.,1183593600,,121,4.545454545454546
2760651,5,B000N818K0,"This is a GREAT video. The music consists of all of the educational favorites (ABCs, Head Shoulders Knees and Toes, etc), but they are put to really fun, high energy, hip hop beats! I find myself humming along too! This is the perfect way to teach the basics and get your kids up and dancing.",1183334400,,292,4.327272727272727
2760702,5,B000N818K0,"We were totally new to It's Hip Hop Baby, we discovered it through an interview with Gayle King on [...].
We originally purchased the brand new ""Dance Class"" DVD that was released on [...] in May this year (2010) and our kids, Michelle and Tommy loved it. We played the dvd during weekends over and over! We were looking for another dvd for Michelle, and we found ""All Your Child's Favourites"" on amazon. I must say this is top class production and direction by Candi Carter, exquisite entertainment and absolutely constructive. Michelle is learning numbers and letters and laughs so much!! Absolutely awesome, won't be dissapointed!!",1276560000,,634,4.990566037735849
2760703,5,B000N818K0,"My kids really love Its Hip Hop Baby!  The music has a great beat and as soon as they hear it ... they focus on the video and start to move!  My daughter, who is now 5 loved the DVD when she was 2 & 3 years old.  My son is 14 months old and loves to count and say his colors with the DVD.

A fun and engaging DVD for your kids... It really is all the favorite songs your kids enjoy, but with a great beat!",1265760000,,405,3.5681818181818183
2760704,5,B000N818K0,"My 3 kids (2) 2 year olds, (1) 14 mos. old LOVE LOVE LOVE this video. They want to watch it every day. They dance and sing they really really adore it.  I bought another called Rocking Dance party - not nearly as good as this one. With that said, this is not really hip hop music or dancing so don't be disappointed. I was hoping for real hip hop for kids and this is not it, but the kids adore it.  I think they call it hip hop because the put a little bass track in the music. Rocking dance party does have this lady trying to teach a little hip hop style dance to the kids but she is extremely annoying. Anyway, buy this video for ages 1-3 and you won't be disappointed. Older kids - I don't know if they like it or not.",1255996800,8,723,3.9115646258503403
2760705,5,B000N818K0,"I purchased other learning videos, I want say ""quite expensive"" for my daughter 10 months at the time. Later to hear about Hip Hop Baby. This is the best product I could have purchased 2 months ago for my daughter. She is now 17 months and watches everyday. She still gets excited to learn the same as the first day.
Thank You",1243209600,3,326,4.274193548387097
2760706,5,B000N818K0,"This video is great!!!  My son is 17 months old and he MUST watch it everyday.  He sings along, counts to 10, says animal sounds, and says the colors.  As a teacher, I think its a great BASIC way to teach kids.....",1241654400,2,214,4.0476190476190474
2760707,5,B000N818K0,"I'm not kidding!!! Within minutes of putting the DVD in, my 2 year old granddaughter was singing and dancing along. It was wonderful! Every day after day-care she wants to look at her ""Hip-Hop Babies"" DVD. This is a wonderful product!",1241049600,2,234,4.7317073170731705
2760708,5,B000N818K0,This is one of my daughter's favorite DVDs. It's a perfect gift to encourage learning and being active. The music is great for dancing and singing! I highly recommend it to anyone with a toddler or with a toddler relative!,1240876800,2,222,4.575
2760709,5,B000N818K0,"Last Friday, I got the best thing in the mail - It's Hop Hop, Baby!

Hannah (14 months) isn't quite old enough to understand all the songs on the ""All Your Child's Favorites"" DVD we got, but she sure did enjoy it! With great games like ""Simon Says"" and ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" all put to upbeat music, it's a kids movie that I actually enjoyed watching and participating in with her! She sure thought that jumping up and down with mommy during ""Simon Says"" was a good time! Although she doesn't know how to do ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" yet, she sure figured out that she should be dancing with that music on pretty quick!

We had a wide variety of songs and short breaks in the 30 minute video. I think the best part was when the kids were asked their favorite letter, and my daughter chimed in with the letter ""C!"" (Okay, she didn't really know what she was doing, but she just learned how to say the letter C, so she heard other kids saying it, and she was NOT going to be left out of this.)

This is a great way to get parents and kids up and moving together. I actually am looking forward to getting to watch it with her again!

It's Hip Hop, Baby is available at Amazon.com for the great price of $7.99. I definitely think it's worth it!",1240185600,2,1260,4.2375
2760710,5,B000N818K0,"My three-year-old cannot get enough of It's Hip Hop Baby.  She runs around saying ""I'm Hip Hop Baby"" all day and night.  Other toddler learning videos are so boring.  This is interactive.  This keeps her moving.  So wonderful for those stay-in days.  My 20-month-old joins in the fun, too.  There's really nothing else like it.",1217894400,,327,4.836363636363636
2760711,5,B000N818K0,"""Hip Hop Baby"" is the most requested video by our 4 and 3 year old daughters.  They love the music, dances and games.  I also hear them counting and reciting the alphabet, so it's educational!  The music is catchy and does not drive me up the wall.  I knew I had a hit with this DVD when my 12 and 10 year old children got down on their knees and started doing the dances with their sisters... what can I say, it's a family affair!  23 minutes - they're busy having fun and I can get some work done and not worry about what they're watching!  Repeat the video for more time!",1217808000,,574,4.080357142857143

8175460,5,B000N818K0,Had to purchase this DVD again after a new addition to the family. All of the kids have loved it. Great DVD.,1405209600,,108,3.9545454545454546
8175461,4,B000N818K0,"Very fun video!  My 2 year old daughter loved it.  She loves watching the other kids, and definitely gets into the singing and doing the movements.  My only negative is that the video seems short.  I wish it was a little longer.  Other than that I would definitely recommend for any young child to start moving and grooving.",1319760000,,324,4.517241379310345
8175462,5,B000N818K0,"My son is 22 months old, and wants to watch this every day.  It's only 20 minutes long, and is teaching him letters, numbers, and colors, plus he loves the Simon Says / ""Freeze!"" game.  I'll probably get more Hip Hop Baby DVDs in the future because this is so well-produced and educational!",1318723200,,290,4.452830188679245
8175463,5,B000N818K0,"My 2 year old grand daughter really liked this DVD and her 4 month old brother laughs and bounces along side her in his jumper swing. The simon says song was a lot of fun for Mom, Nana and kids. Having the kids talk on the video in between keeps her interest as she loves other kids. I will look for other Hip Hop Baby DVD's. I especially like the diversity and individuality of the wonderful group of children in the production.",1314489600,,429,4.2439024390243905

8175465,5,B000N818K0,I have been buying the series for friends for years...it is my go to gift for any child's first or second birthday.  All my friends rave about it and then give it as gifts to their friends.  I started letting my two year old watch when he was about 15 months...it was the only video he wanted to watch and still...a year later...it is his favorite.,1294272000,,348,4.257575757575758
8175466,4,B000N818K0,I brought this DVD for my daughter who was 4 years old at the time.  She enjoyed dancing and singing along.  This DVD is really geared towards the young... wouldn't recommend it for a child over 5 years old.,1288656000,3,207,4.282051282051282
