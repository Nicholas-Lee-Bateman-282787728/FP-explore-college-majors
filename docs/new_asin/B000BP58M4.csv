Mike Power is magnetic and this and Heat are the greatest and truest depictions of the art of hold up movies ever made.
The theme is enigmatic and the length is just right, think ill watch it again tonight, for the hundredth time.",1431561600,,298,4.067796610169491
8090393,4,B000BP58M4,"First rate Aussie crime TV series based on real events. A gang of professional criminals decide to rob the Victoria Sporting Club on race day. Melbourne's bookies are unwise enough to bring all their takings to their social club and hence the bad guys escape with a record haul. Not only that but they leave the police without any clues as to who did it.

As in most films about large robberies the problems start when the villians either fall out amougst themshelves or as in this case, rival criminals try and cut themselves in.

Nothing we have not seen before, but worth it for the Australian setting.",1144627200,2,605,4.592592592592593
