7921822,3,B00004S897,"I was really excited to order this DVD and to have a piece of my Bulgarian childhood. The selection is just ok (there are more memorable Bulgarian cartoons out there.) I was disappointed that the Three Fools cartoon had an English voice-over: the original does not use words, just sounds like ""Hmmm"" and ""Ahhh"" and that is what has made it a favorite over the years!",1223510400,3,366,4.5606060606060606

7921824,3,B00004S897,"This collection of Bulgarian animation is amusing and appropriate for kids, whichis not what can be said about most of what's on television these days.
But what does that have to do with Nickelodeon's beloved ""Rugrats""? The cartoons ""Baby Dreams at the Airport"" and ""Baby Dreams at the Automobile Factory"" are wilder and funnier than what Tommy's gang gets involved with and there's no annoying Angelica to frustrate the babies' attempts to explore their world.
There's other good 'toons on this dvd - they have a group that's a cross between the 3 Stooges and the guys in ""Dumb and Dumber"" and that's funny. And ""The Intelligent Villiage"" reminds me of the old children's song ""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly..."" and all the humor that extends from that set-up.
So try something a little different, expand your cultural horizons and watch this - you'll find that Bulgaria has a lot to offer the world of animation.",1038873600,7,926,4.79375
