8184873,2,B000OFOLXI,There is only one episode per season on there. This season is incomplete. Where are the rest of the episodes? There are supposed to be a whole season of What Not to Wear.,1418169600,,170,4.181818181818182
8184874,2,B000OFOLXI,the gods must not have wanted us to see this episode (I believe it was Clinton's first appearance on WNTW); three disks in a row were defective and would not play. Finally gave up. Other discs in this series have been just fine; a bad pressing (or however they make these things)? Customer service was impeccable; no problem there.,1303344000,,331,4.627118644067797
