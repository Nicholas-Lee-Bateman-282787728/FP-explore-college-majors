8363919,5,B002CEOC7O,"Mares are imprisoned in tiny stalls and kept pregnant for the sake of a billion dollar scandalous Premarin industry profiting from the sad, brutal confinement collection of horse pee from repeatedly impregnated mares!  Most of her foals are slaughtered...these babies are led into tiny stalls and a machine comes over the top and zaps the baby in the forehead and it falls dead.  It is butchered for dog meat or sold who knows where.
If women only knew the truth, would she buy this horse piss steroid drugs?  Not only does industry profit from the lie of ""hormone replacement therapy"" for what is in truth toxic and carcinogenic steroid drugs, but the abuse of these beautiful animals is outrageous.  History proves both women and horses are slaughtered for the sake of billions in female steroid drug profits.  Interesting fact: men are always told when prescribed ""his steroids"" while ""her steroid"" drugs are titled, as if a safe ""therapy.""  I smell a evil rats...lots of them throughout this drug industry and the FDA!",1401667200,2,1022,4.912790697674419
