7498040,1,B01792WJKK,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, hard to say anything positive about this movie, some of the poorest acting and script writing in recent memory, and the voiceovers were absolutely atrocious.  I started this movie with 4 family members and soon was the last person left watching, wish I gave up on the movie a lot sooner.  Save yourself the hour or so and do something better with your time.",1499472000,2,399,4.4520547945205475

7498043,1,B01792WJKK,"I am sorry to say this was a terrible movie - and I do not say this lightly.  I wanted to like it.  My daughter is in it!  Poor acting, choppy script and bad voice overs.

In addition to the poor product, the producers had promised the kids that they would be invited to a screening of the movie and receive a copy of the DVD.  They delivered on neither.  Very disappointing.",1488499200,3,375,4.138888888888889

7498045,5,B01792WJKK,"What a film! Cuteness galore! So many dogs and doggies being cute and running around. Adorable! Fun for the whole family! I brought this to my friends house for our kids birthday and they loved it! We all had fun and ate cake and enoyed the movie! Goes to show that with the right filmmakers, a family movie can be fun for everyone to watch! Looking forward to more from these guys! Great work! :D A+++",1485907200,,402,4.302631578947368
7498046,4,B01792WJKK,"Good show but, I thought there would be more people and dog playing togethers. It was almost all just the dogs playing and talking until just about the last 10 to 15 minutes. That's why I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",1466726400,,228,4.088888888888889
7498047,5,B01792WJKK,"Adorable kids, dogs and story! A fun watch for all animal lovers and dog lovers especially, dozens of adorable talking dogs with cute personalities and quirks in a comedy adventure that rocks the silver screen of your living room! lol

There is one scene that if you don't want to smile... :P

Great work guys!",1454544000,,310,4.618181818181818
7498048,1,B01792WJKK,"I usually check review sources because I purchase dvds for my workplace, and I do like kid movies and animal movies. I couldn't find any reviews but it was Dove family approved, so I figured how bad could it be? It was awful. We could only stand to watch the first 20 mins. that's how bad it was. The filming is amateurish, looks like it was filmed in someone's house, the acting is bad, the dogs aren't even cute enough to save it! They filmed dogs in a circle at one point, and then just did a voice track over it. It wasn't believable, and the sound tracks didn't even match (the girl speaks, and then a dog's voice come in much louder and obviously spliced in!) It made me appreciate the skill of movies like Underdog and the Buddies movies that make you believe the animals are talking and reacting. Even the storyline was bad- there were a bunch of dogs in the woods. We think they were supposed to be strays, but they had collars and harnesses on and it was hard to tell what was going on. Going back to bad acting, the ""stray"" dogs are in the woods, and an adult and child come up to them. The dogs are just there, and the people see them, stop, scream and run away. For my daughter, the animal lover, to want to stop the dvd means that it was unbearable.",1452470400,,1263,4.20164609053498
8738401,1,B01792WJKK,"My kids found this on the Prime Video app. Apparently despite only having two stars it still appeared as a recommended movie. Terrible acting, horrendous voice acting, no logical plot progression. There is loads of amateur stuff on YouTube of higher quality and with higher production standards.",1533081600,,295,5.297872340425532

8738408,1,B01792WJKK,"Terribly scripted, poorly acted, and without a sensible plot, Doggy Daycare is a movie about dogs by someone who had never seen either prior to filming.",1502841600,,152,4.884615384615385
8738409,1,B01792WJKK,"Seldom do I feel the need to write a review on a movie.  But in this case I feel a warning label should be put on this one to warn parents before they play it for their children.  Please list the warning as thus:

Anti breeder
Vegan Agenda
Poorly scripted
And most likely will regress your child by 4 grades.",1501977600,,308,4.1
