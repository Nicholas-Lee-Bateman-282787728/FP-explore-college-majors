To this very day, this group astounds and amazes me with their interaction and energy.  Every one of these remarkable musicians was (an is) a master of their crafts and together were a force to be reckoned with!

The quality of these two concert excepts are amazingly good for the year that they were recorded visually and sound wise!  There was even some cute shots like when Miles taps the side of his head after a solo and acts like he needs to 'pop his ears' because of the high altitude?  Or, when Shorter almost seems to be talking through his horn when telling his story in his solos.  There is one very short spot where there is a short buzz that may take you by surprise but that is not even worth mentioning and it does not take away from the enjoyment of the vid.  Hey, for those out there who love these guys and have not purchased this gem........what th' hell are you waiting for??!!  A MUST HAVE!",1308528000,3,1180,4.533018867924528
