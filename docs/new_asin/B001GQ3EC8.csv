8306622,2,B001GQ3EC8,"I was hoping for a video that would show Levine and Shikler working on, and developing solutions to the problem of portraiture. What you get is a loosely organized studio class being entertained by Justice O'Connor repeating cliched anecdotes about historical and contemporary personalities on the Court. The paintings are, on the whole, amateurish and poorly conceived, and the comments by David and Aaron are glib and unhelpful. For the life of me, I can't imagine what the filmmakers thought they had here, but it is directionless, shallow, and thematically vacant. O'Connor comes across as sincere and likable, and David Levine his usual warm and reflective self.
If you are looking for artistic insight, you won't find it here.",1262736000,2,732,5.159663865546219
