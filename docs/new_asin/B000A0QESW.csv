2348167,5,B000A0QESW,"easy dvd to follow, has not only yoga, but an aerobics section too.  Sets a relaxed pace as it moves from pose to pose so you never feel rushed.  I'd highly recommend this no matter how stiff and sore you are.",1271289600,53,209,4.073170731707317
2348168,3,B000A0QESW,"The video is good because it shows you different levels of activity, ages, etc.  It's a little slow (as is Yoga) and I have a hard time sitting through the whole thing...",1271203200,13,170,4.3125
2348169,5,B000A0QESW,This DVD is perfect for someone with limited mobility to get the body moving and get some form of evercise. You can do as much or as little as you like.  This DVD is for those who want to experience the milder forms of yoga and that have full mobility or for those who are chair bound and everyone in between. Very easy and fun to follow.,1178928000,83,338,4.044776119402985
2348170,5,B000A0QESW,"I have CFS, Fibromyalgia (FM), and degenerative joint & muscle disease.  I am 90% bedridden yet I am able to do this workout regularly.  There are three levels shown for each of these very low-impact routines.  You can do all the exercises sitting in a chair if necessary.  All the  exercises are simple and focus specifically on the hot spots of FM and  arthritis.  The best part is the wonderful relaxation portion at the end.  It just doesn't come any easier than this.  If I can do it...YOU have no  excuse not to try it for yourself.  I even bought a copy for my mother.",953078400,55,575,4.380952380952381
2348191,3,B000A0QESW,"I encourage renting this video from the library to help you to decide if it is for you.  I agree with the other reviewer who stated that it's too easy.  I have arthritis in my back, and I usually workout with Peggy Cappy's videos, which are wonderful for me. This video would be a waste of money for me, and I'm glad I rented it to preview it.  It is not COMPLETELY yoga - there is an aerobic section, also.  I would imagine that it might be a good workout for someone who has very limited mobility.",1447545600,,499,4.11340206185567
2348192,1,B000A0QESW,"I had given this a raving review but have since changed my mind.  Something happens when you do the aerobic section, I don't know if it is having your arms upraised too much or that the pace picks up or that it isn't done on an even rhythm, or all of the above.  I work out with three people and eventually, doing this daily we all had to stop in the aerobic section for being dizzy, I mean totally stop and sit down.  Tried it sitting down instead of standing up and it made no difference, still had to quit during the aerobics for becoming dizzy.  Two of us also have shoulder and neck issues and we noticed this dvd causes flare ups of these conditions.  So, my review is dropped from 5 stars to one for I will never do this workout again, and I doubt my two friends will either.  Apparently yoga is as nasty as I first thought it to be.  I question the safety of this one.",1445126400,3,876,4.087719298245614

2348197,5,B000A0QESW,"I bought this for my mother who suffers from severe arthritis and although it's been a little tough for her in the beginning, she is getting better at it each week and thanks me all the time for getting it for her. She says it's the best she's felt in a long time.",1420588800,2,264,4.0

2348199,5,B000A0QESW,Been using this CD for about four years.  Makes a big difference in flexibility and general feeling of well-being. Also gave it as a gift to a friend.,1414972800,4,150,4.357142857142857
2348200,5,B000A0QESW,I purchases this for my dad as he awaited a hip replacement.  He was actually able to perform these yoga moves and become more mobile and experienced a marked decrease in pain.  Dad had his hip surgery the 18 of Mar and I believe that because of this DVD he was able to recover so quickly.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has arthritis and is feeling discourage about their ability to exercise.,1398988800,4,404,4.36
2348221,4,B000A0QESW,"My husband and I have used this cd maybe 50 times. It gives us a gentle loosening up with no pain. Now that winter is back we'll get back to it. We really notice an improvement. It works on every body part, easy to follow, good pacing. No sweating, jumping or yelling!",1385424000,4,268,4.173076923076923

2348223,2,B000A0QESW,Not what I expected. Save yourself the money and go the Y swimming or something. Just didn't like it at all.,1377216000,,108,4.190476190476191

2348225,5,B000A0QESW,"This DVD is exactly what it says. It has variations for more or less mobility and a very good starter for those who have not been exercising for some time.
I have done yoga most of my life but the past couple of years I've had to undertake more physcical work and just have not had the energy to tackle any exercise. As a result I have gained weight and suffer from arthritis. I know from experience yoga helps but have had difficulty getting back into the habit. This DVD is a great help. It has just enough movement to get me going again!",1362614400,5,540,4.201923076923077
2348226,5,B000A0QESW,"When I first played this DVD, I thought, oh dear, this is so simple and boring.  I was quite wrong.  Actually, it's not that easy, and  using it makes a big difference in how I feel.  The exercises loosen and strengthen almost every part of the body, and the breathing helps to me to relax.  I try to take the time to use it every other day.  I think it's very professional done with concern, as advertised, for those with arthritic type conditons.  Thank you.",1360713600,13,460,4.341176470588235

2348228,5,B000A0QESW,"This video has really helped.  Have arthritis and have had both knees replaced so it limits me.  This has gone a long way toward strengthing my muscles.  I particularly notice it in my legs. I do it everyday.  I have the electric pedals which I do an hour each day, but think this is helping the muscles more.  Only been using it about a month and there is noticable improvement already.",1336089600,17,387,4.394366197183099
2348229,5,B000A0QESW,"Thank you for making & offering this exercise DVD for those like me with constant severe pain. My severe Rheumatoid Arthritis & Fibromyalgia is throughout my entire body, which makes moving, let alone working out, difficult. It's imperative with Rheumatoid Arthritis to keep moving- this DVD makes that possible. Thank You.",1333152000,8,323,5.352941176470588
2348230,2,B000A0QESW,"This DVD shows basic stretching excercises for sitting, standing and laying down. What this video shows can be retrieved by a Google search on 'stretching' for free. Though yoga incorporates stretching methods into yogo routines, (to me) this DVD is not yoga. I've taken yoga classes before and they were much more robust than this DVD. The DVD spends little time on breathing techniques, which is a big part of yoga. Save your money and do the Google search...",1314835200,6,461,4.848101265822785
2348241,5,B000A0QESW,"I have to say -- I quit my membership at Curves several months ago because of osteoarthritis of the knee, and knew I needed to do something because sitting around was making the pain and stiffness worse.  I purchased this DVD and honestly -- best thing I've done.  No matter what your degree of arthritis is or how old you are, there is a level here that will be appropriate for you.  I have since purchased a few other fitness DVDs and alternate between them depending on how I feel that day.  This DVD is a little slow moving and laid back but it gets the job done. Believe me when I tell you, you will definitely feel more range of motion and as a result, be more active after doing this Yoga.  Just do it!",1313884800,28,709,4.1838235294117645
2348242,4,B000A0QESW,"I have never done any Yoga before,I've found this to be really helpful.  It's a good workout and I loved the relaxation portion.  Am looking forward to being able to do more and helping to control the stiffnes and pain of my RA.

2348243,4,B000A0QESW,"I've never done yoga & thought I'd like to join a group but needed a starting point.  Sort of an introduction & loosening up place to start before I threw my hat in the ring with a group.  This turned out to be a good choice for me.  The instruction has 3 levels of participation & you can pick what's right for you.  Some reviewers have complained that it's too easy but for me it was, as Goldilocks says, Just Right!  I graduated to a class at my local senior center with limber joints & was able to hit the ground running (well, bending to be exact).  This video is a good value for your $$$.",1305676800,13,595,4.086206896551724

2348245,5,B000A0QESW,"I was not well acquainted with yoga, but very well acquainted with arthritis.  Exercise can be problematic.  This DVD seems to be the answer.  It is well put together and anyone can do this.  You don't have to have arthritis to make use of this program.  I'm 80 years old and it's great to keep me limber.  The DVD is divided into 5 parts and includes sitting, standing, floor, aerobics, and cool down.  Give it a try.  It's endorsed by the Arthritis Foundation.",1296259200,22,462,4.481927710843373
