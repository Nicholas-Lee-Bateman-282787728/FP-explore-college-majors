6413652,5,B00KBLVA9I,"I originally started watching this series when I purchased series 1&2 as instant video here on Amazon.  I have been waiting for the final series(3) to become available but I finally saw that this set with all three series was available--so I did not hesitate but  purchased it ( plus a Blu-Ray player too)
I enjoyed Showtime's version but at least this series takes you to the end of their story line and not leave you hanging. The acting is great especially Mark Ryder as Cesare.  The costumes and scenery also makes this series enjoyable..  There are some graphic scenes (violence and full nudity)--so be aware .  Anyway as soon as I received this set, I watched it from the 1st disc to the end--- loosing some sleep-- didn't want to stop.. Like someone else said--- I hated to see it end",1432252800,3,790,4.535211267605634
6413653,5,B00KBLVA9I,"A great series. Different enough from the Showtime version to make it worth watching both. Though I think I liked this one a bit more than the Showtime version - for one thing, this version covered more of the Borgia story and ended off smoothly.

This version does start off a little rough - the acting in the early episodes sometimes left something to be desired - but it settled out after a little while. The third season was the best if you ask me, though it may seem a bit rushed in parts - they had a lot left of the story to cover with only one season to do it in.

Not a series for the squeamish or for younger people. This was a very violent period of history, and it is clearly portrayed here. Lots of explicit sex as well.

The last episode was kind of sad, but that is how the story actually played out historically. I will miss having more of the series to watch - the characters had begun to seem almost like friends.

Highly recommended.",1430265600,2,952,4.214285714285714
6413654,5,B00KBLVA9I,Terrific program with many actors not too well known in the USA but they are terrific!  I've watched the entire program at least 5 times.  Loved it!,1430006400,,148,4.444444444444445
6413655,5,B00KBLVA9I,"I enjoyed the ""Borgia"", series. I wish there was more like series out there to see. P.",1429747200,,86,4.117647058823529
6413656,4,B00KBLVA9I,"I was glad to get all three seasons. I loved both Showtime's and this version. I am glad this series had closure.  The only issue I have with this set is season three will not let you turn off subtitles. Thankfully my Philips region free player let's me shift them almost all the way off the screen.
I wish they would release the 3rd season in the US.",1428105600,2,351,4.161764705882353
6413657,5,B00KBLVA9I,"This is not the Showtime series.  It was produced in English in eastern Europe and aired on French, German and Italian television.  It is intricately plotted and sumptuously produced with fantastic sets, also far earthier than the Showtime series with more sex and violence.  Not necessarily historically accurate, but great drama.  I bought the first two seasons on region B German blu-rays and paid through the nose for them, but it was worth the expense.  I bought this set directly from DaaVeeDee for $54.99 just to get the final season three.  At this price, the complete three-season set is a bargain!  These Dutch blu-rays are region-free and play beautifully on my $70 U.S. (region A) Sony blu-ray player.  Audio is in English and the Dutch subtitles can be turned off, but only on seasons one and two.  The Dutch subtitles on season three are forced for some reason, but I got used to overlooking them  Only criticism I've seen is some people don't like the modern English expressions used in some of the dialogue, but would you rather have it in Latin?  Great stuff -- I have really enjoyed this series and highly recommend it!",1421884800,10,1137,4.779487179487179
6413658,5,B00KBLVA9I,"Having watched both series on Netflix and having ordered the first and second seasons of ""Borgia"" from Amazon, I'd have to go with this one as being superior to the Showtime version.  It's also factually closer to what really happened historically.

Sumptuous costuming and the violence is definitely much more earthier than the other series.  The actress who plays Lucreiza is pretty much a dead ringer for the real thing if the paintings of Lucreiza is any indication.  I didn't really think the actor playing Cesare fit in..until he grew into that goatee..then woah.....what a resemblance.  My only beef is that I wish they'd explored Caterina Sforza's part in the Borgia story more throughly than the cut-off arc they presented.  And the Showtime version of the events was pretty preposterous having read throughly about Caterina's role considering that she definitely did NOT have those kind of resources as the countess of Forli and Imola and couldn't even depend on her Milanese Sforza relations due to politics and besides she was a bastard child on top of it all. But she was definitely one of the most extraordinary personas of the Renaissance and deserves a movie of her own. Her life on it's own is that colorful.

Anyway back to the series itself.  The intrigue in the series was a good deal more intricate and the events surrounding Anne of Brittany's marriage comes darn near the historical facts as it was one of the great scandals of that era. (Brother tries to set aside wife to marry his brother's widow to keep Brittany part of France and the intrigue between the French court and Papacy towards receiving the necessary annulment.  Della' Rovere definitely is at his creepiest best during that part.

To sum up the two different Borgias...if you want real meat, I'd go with Canal TV's Borgia.  For fast food appetites, go with Showtime's The Borgias.",1471737600,4,1870,4.886075949367089
6413659,1,B00KBLVA9I,"I wasted my money and want to warn others not to do the same by putting my honest review up here for an absolutely awful show, instead of what I believe are either paid reviews or biased reviews by those involved in producing the show.

This was the all time worst show I have ever watched.

I bought it because on Amazon it was rated with a 4-star average and in IMDB it had a 7.9 star average. But it was awful and a complete waste of money! I don't know who is rating this show highly, maybe the partially comatose actors or the film makers or producers. But don't be fooled and save your money - this show is simply unwatchable.

To summarize, the acting was terribly WOODEN across the board, the dialogue was awful, the characters had no development and portrayed no emotions at all, the plots made no sense, and there was not a single redeeming quality about the show.

More Details: The main actor, John Doman, who plays Rodrigo Borgia / Pope Alexander VI is the most wooden and awful performance I have ever seen. He is absolutely awful. His American accent in the middle of everyone else being European is also jarring. But if his acting were decent, it could be overlooked. But his acting was not only not decent, it was completely wooden acting.

The dialogue was also bad and boring. There was no character to the characters. There was no build up to the plot. The other actors were also boring and shallow. There were no emotions portrayed and no drama at all. Just lots of wooden acting. The plots made little sense the way they were portrayed with no connection from one event to another. Even the camera work was amateur.

I wanted to like this show, I really did, because period shows are my favorite and there are too few of them out there because they are expensive to produce. I tried so very hard to like this show, watched another episode and yet another just to see if it got any better. But it never got better and only got worse. The same wooden acting, bad dialogue, plot that made no sense, no character development, terrible filming one episode after another.

Another reviewer said this show looked like a high school play rehearsal. It was worse than that!",1468713600,,2186,4.477386934673367
6413660,5,B00KBLVA9I,"Excellent series. In my opinion much better than ""The Borgias"". Some state the differing accents are distracting. I personally didn't find it took away from the series at all. Be ready for some authentic medieval violence and intrigue second to none.",1466812800,,250,5.121951219512195
6413661,1,B00KBLVA9I,"if anybody s aware that there are two offerings of this great story based mostly on historical fact but, certainly not completely historically accurate  Due to Producers,And Directors and screenplay writers. The one with ""Jeremy Irons"" is by far the greatest version of this noteworthy show. However,this incarnation is The most terrible depiction of the characters that I have ever seen. It is Flat,without emotion and is worlds away from the ""Showtime Version"".If I was in charge of the screen actors quild this so called actors would have their union cards taken away and it would be recommended that they seek some other type of employment because acting is obviously not their  strong suit. I recommend they go into a vocational field like plumbing or electrical but,please do us a favor and stay away from acting.",1461715200,3,819,5.014705882352941

I sent requests to the studio, the distributor and to the FB page, all seemed very surprised it was not out there to be bought. Fans of this series wait and wait, we can see it on Netflix but we would like the ability to buy the last season without subtitles and with full access to all the information.

6413668,5,B00KBLVA9I,"The packaging: All 10 discs are inserted in a single, plastic, foldable holder.  This holder is inserted in a single, 1-1/4"", plastic box.  It's unusual and I've not seen anything like it in America. The holder secures discs so strongly that it can be very difficult to remove a disc without bending it!

The Blu-Rays: These European discs will all work. However, on one of my Blu-Ray players, only the episodes worked. All of the extras would NOT work. But on another Blu-Ray player, all the disc/programs worked just fine. Both Blu-Ray players had their, respective, latest updates. So, you might have sporatic results. Also, in my situation, the subtitles would NOT turn off on all of the Season 3 discs.

The Series: It is my opinion that this series has a European tone such that many American audiences would not have the patience either with the various spoken dialects (and some foreign-language words) or the many details of names, places, and other historical issues. I've always been very comfortable with this milieu. If you incline more towards European sensibilities, I think you would love the series as I do.

6413669,4,B00KBLVA9I,"This is a good series, and I bought this collection a while back at another location. The one thing that I would like to point out is the shows does not fully portray what really happened. This is a show based on person's idea, and if you want to know some of the historical facts look at some credible historical books.
There are two different shows about the Borgia's, and they both have different stories. However, I found this version to be much better, and more entertaining. The one thing that I did like about this series that at the end of season 3 the actors gave some historical facts about the character they played.
This is a great show to encourage you to do some research on certain characters such as Cesare Borgia. That is the one good thing that I like about TV series that are based on historical facts they lead the person into wanting to know more.",1446076800,8,868,4.39751552795031

6413672,1,B00KBLVA9I,"Wow.  Average five stars!  Sounds like the 100% turnouts in elections in Zimbabwe and Philadelphia voting for the Great Leader!  I've watched two or three episodes only to see if it could get any worse, and it does.  Watching a bunch of airheads ""acting"" as if they are serious, thoughtful people is fun for awhile, but soon fades.  The Pope guy talks like Tony Curtis in ""Taras Bulba"" saying, ""Yonder lies the castle of my faddah,"" except more monotonously.  Throw in lots gratuitous sex, violence and cart loads of excrement, and you've got your five stars, you bet.

Do I rebuy the whole series to add # Three to my collection?.  At least the complete set  IS on blu-ray.  So far, I'm resisting in hopes the third installment will become available by itself.

I watched and enjoyed the entire American series and thought it was good. Then I watched season 1 of Borgia Faith and Fear. This is a masterpiece! I just took delivery of a this European set of all 3- seasons on Blu-ray and am really appreciating the quality of the production as well as the script and acting. It is quite graphic and a bit risqu but if you like the genre this is a must!! Do be aware that while the language is English the subtitles are Dutch.,1499990400,,590,4.230088495575221
