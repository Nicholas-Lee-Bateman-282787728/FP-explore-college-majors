435349,1,6302194725,"This is just another pro-communist film that tries to re-paint the 1950's as some type of ruthless time subjected by patriots against innocent leftists. The reality is that Hollywood was full of not only leftwingers but with hardcore communists as well. These people conspired with Soviet agents to tilt the U.S. to the Left and to aid the Soviets in their global war against the U.S.
This film is pure lies in the way it tries to portray these communists as innocent filmakers. The reality is that they were quite guilty and the evidence demonstrating this was without a doubt quite valid.
There's nothing to see in this film that would relate to historical fact so don't waste your time.",1077580800,8,689,4.75
435350,3,6302194725,"*** 1/2 stars rating for ""Guilty By Suspicion"". The movie is set in the times when the sole mention of the term ""communist"" was seen as synonymous of ""evil"". The film is a critique to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), when it created a Hollywood blacklist, which included Hollywood celebrities considered as communists, banning their works and denying them the opportunity of getting new jobs, until they provided names of more people that ""attempted against the American Way Of Life"".

 Despite the fact that a lot of people mistakenly relates the communism with the word ""criminal"", actually the communism is another way of life of some countries, mostly Europeans. ""Guilty By Suspicion"" criticizes the paranoia that a lot of people suffered when they heard the word ""communism"". The thing is that there were (and there are) some criminal communists, as well as there were (and there are) some criminal German, Americans, Mexicans, English, Asians, etc., in all the world there are criminals. But is ridiculous to judge a whole culture with a different way of life based on a few bad people.

 Perhaps ""Guilty By Suspicion"" is not the best political drama movie, but its message is clear, and also features good performances (the fantastic Robert De Niro and the attractive Annette Bening), interesting situations, and a Martin Scorsese cameo. At the end of the day, ""Guilty By Suspicion"" is an interesting political drama.",1059436800,6,1442,5.123404255319149
435351,5,6302194725,"This movie is a saddening look at one of America's darkest times. It has received lots of negative reviews, but don't listen to them. It is the best movie I have seen about the times and it captures the essence of Hollywood during the 1950s when McCarthy and the House Un-American Committee were at the peak of power. Robert De Niro is excellent, as always, as David Merrill, a director with success, fans, and he is living his dream. Then he goes on a vacation, and when he returns, the town is different. The movie opens up with a typical Committee meeting in which David's friend Larry is spooked by the committee. Before long he is burning his books and disowning his wife as a communist. Red Fever has hit town, and David is next in line. Somebody has named him as a Communist sympathyzer, and he refuses to testify to the Committee because he is angry and doesn't want to hurt his friends. Before long he finds he cannot get a job, not directing, producing, or even working in a film repair shop. His life is turned upside down, and he decides finally to testify to the Committee. The acting is what makes this movie, De Niro, but also Annette Bening, George Wendt, Martin Scorsese is great in a cameo. My favorite part is when one cast member is called a commie by the producer for siding with David. ""I turned in commies without the government even asking. If you want to call me a commie, you got to back it up."" David replies, ""If he wants to call you a commie, he doesn't need to back it up."" Some people say it is contrived or unbelievable, but the transformation in David, from materialistic director to a man seeing the need to defy the McCarthyists is done well. If you like history, or if you like De Niro, you will enjoy this film.",998092800,36,1748,4.398148148148148
435352,5,6302194725,"This is a great film about one of the darkest period of American history, the Committee on Un-American activities in 1952, what is known as McCarthyism. It deals only with Hollywood though it had a quite wider range. What is striking about the film is that it looks at this unbearable negation of the American constitution only from the human consequences it created : wives, children, and of course husbands too, but most of the victims were men, at least as shown in the film. The people who came under suspicion were tracked down, under permanent surveillance from the FBI, and they lost all their jobs, all employment possibilities, in the film industry but also in any field possible, no matter how small. They were pushed into suicide, or dereliction. They lost their houses, their property, any means of living and they had to disappear. Happy were those who had passports from other countries, because they were able to leave the country in time, like Charlie Chaplin, and to get refuge in England, France or other countries. There is absolutely no excuse for this action, even if there are many explanations : the Cold War, the anticommunist panic, jealousy and competition from those who were not at the top and managed to get rid of those who were at the top and blocked them, ambition to be able to have a career even if the ambitious did not have the value of their victims, etc. It created a society based on rumors, denunciations, hatred, and a total lack of human values and rejection of all moral and ethical principles. The State had become crazy and had reinvented the fascism that it had fought in Germany and Italy. But the worst part of it is that it took America twenty years to repair the damage. A nd some were not repairable, like the execution of the Rosenbergs. In spite of all, the film is optimistic on human nature, too optimistic, because it is centered on two friends who refuse to talk, who refuse to answer the questions and give names. But those courageous individuals are so few that this optimism is reduced to nearly nothing, a few human beings who consider that their principles, the very principles of their American constitution are more important than their present and their future, that it is easier to explain to their children the victimization they suffer than to explain to them when they are of age that their fathers or mothers had been finks, unhuman an inhumane vultures giving their own friends to the claws of vengeance rather than defending those friends as best they could, which was their Christian duty too.

435353,1,6302194725,"This movie replaces character development and plot with an earnestly earnest exposition on well-known historical facts. It is  about the victimization of people by the House Committee on Unamerican Activities (HUAC). Robert De Niro protrays a movie director (Robert Merrill) who with unflinching courage defends himself from false accusations, protects his friends' reputations and exposes the committee for the know-nothing jingoists that they are. It would have been a much better movie if De Niro's character was a human being and not a preternatural being of infinite virtue and courage. He, with a steely gaze, destroys his own and his estranged wife's lives with his unyielding principles. St Thomas More would have to acknowedge that compared to the Robert Merrill character, he was a moral coward.
HUAC is now an historical fact with the judgement of history revealing it as an hysterical reaction to a mythical threat. The real question about this movie is why its creators thought that they had to reveal the same historical facts to their audience with paste board characters in a stilted plot. If they had used the HUAC hearings as a backdrop to examine someone whose world had been talken from him unjustly, this could have been a fascinating movie. However that would be a different movie in which the personalities of the characters would have been more than stock political cliches.",982108800,5,1398,5.131578947368421
435354,4,6302194725,"The brief reign of terror of HUAC and Senator Joe McCarthy is something that American politicians and the American media would like to bury and forget.  This candid little film, blessed by some distinguished cast  members and driven by de Niro's usual dynamic performance, brings the  skeleton out of the closet with deep feeling, thoughtfulness, and  realism.
For viewers who don't know about this shameful chapter in US  politics, GbS is a real eye-opener.  For viewers who are familiar with the  era and its events, GbS brings that history to life vividly, with startling  immediacy.
Production values are solid throughout, with excellent period  detail and atmosphere.  Dialogue is credible and intelligent, and I found  the realism of the film quite compelling, engaging and holding my attention  and sympathy throughout.
In an era when feel-good jingoism and fantasy  dominate big-ticket US filmmaking, GbS seems almost ""like a European  film"" -- it's a sober, subtle and pensive construction upon historical  fact.  I recommend it very highly to anyone interested in US history or in  films for grown-ups.  Viewers who enjoyed Breaking the Code, That Summer of  White Roses, The Official Story, The Last Butterfly -- or even Schindler's  List, Ghandi, and Inherit the Wind -- ought to give this their attention  for an evening.

435386,5,6302194725,"A realistic look at a terrible time for many Americans. This film is about the true happenings of Hollywood during the 1950's when the Un-American Committee was ruled by McCarthy and going through their anti-communist mania. It is the best film on this subject and I do not understand the people who left the bad reviews on this brilliant movie which captures the true essence of what this film is trying to convey. During the McCarthy era, thousands of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The characters are realistic in the various ways they deal with the unraveling of their lives.

De Niro is excellent (as always) as David Merrill, a successful director. He comes back from shooting a film in Europe and everything in tinseltown has changed. What we see in this film is an accurate portrayal of how the 'Hollywood Blacklist' came to be. In the film industry, more than 300 actors, authors and directors were denied work in the U.S. through this unofficial list. Of this limited genre (movies about the Hollywood Blacklist) there are only a few films to choose from and they include, The Front, Good Night, and Good Luck, Guilty by Suspicion, Hollywood on Trial, The Majestic, Trumbo, and Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg - of them I would definitely say that this film (Guilty by Suspicion) is by far the best. All of the actors were excellent. Annette Bening played his supporting wife, George Wendt a distressed friend who proved his friendship in the end, Patricia Wettig as an alcoholic actress who loses her son and Martin Scorsese, who was fantastic saying he was a communist and planning to leave the USA. The core of this story is David's decision - he must decide whether to turn informant, or to stick to principle at the cost of his life's work.

In the end, the damage done was not by those who had flirted with communism--and it is important to remember that the Communist Party National Convention in 1936 was held in Madison Square Garden--but by politicians playing on irrational fear that communists were secretly running the country.

435393,4,6302194725,"Guilty By Suspicion covers a time from the late 1940s to the mid 1950s when there was a Communist Witch Hunt in Hollywood, a time that has been compared to the Salem Witch Trials where people were hanged on the flimsiest of evidence. What was never asked was, ""when is enough enough?"" If the standards were low for determining witches and communists, then potentially everyone can get hanged.

But there is a life lesson here--one among many. If you try and hurt a media person they will get back at you in the form of a movie or song--just read some of Taylor Swift's lyrics about ex-friend Drew to confirm this. ""Guilty By Suspicion"" falls into this category. Its not just about the times, but is about how Hollywood was treated. This movie is not objective. Nothing is mentioned about the strained relationships betwen the US and Russia, how many Americans were building bomb shelters in their back yard, how there were communists in Hollywood, how Russia threatened to bury the US, and how many by name in Hollywood did testify as friendly witnesses at the HUAC meetings. This is a lot of information to leave out. There is no context for this movie or background information, no balanced perspective, or why people like Walt Disney and Gary Cooper said what they said.

While it can and should be said that what happened was not the best way to deal with suspicions like this, consider the times. Would you lock up a certain people in jail if their country had bombed or threatened to bomb and destroy the United States with Atomic Weapons? This is more likely to happen in times of national stress.

Hollywood has long been an elitist group. They consider themselves to be experts on war, oil, economics, poverty, hunger, gun control, and and the environment. They don't want guns in America, but want to make exceptions for themselves, because they are famous. Its not nice to criticise Hollywood, and if anyone disagrees with the morality displayed in movies its not the fault of Hollywood, but of the common person who is not as enlightened as Hollywood is.

Thus, there is an element of propaganda in this movie. Its only seen from the side of those who were blacklisted and harrassed. Its a one sided picture of the times, with no context of the times in which this happened. Its a shame that what did happen was done in a very poor fashion by the powers that be who seemed more interested in making a name for themselves than seeking genuine truth. But this is not all that happened, and it may be for the reasons of what were left out of the movie that gives it a slight stogy feel.

435414,5,6302194725,"This movie, which I watch perhaps a dozen times during the course of a single year, keeps me mesmerized on the hearings portrayed on the screen...on the emotional suffering of all involved in this painful period of American history...and on the well-told and well-filmed movie--well worth the time, money, and emotional expense (yes...for me it's emotionally painful to watch a movie about such a confusing and confused episode in our past).  It all belongs in our dark past, but watch it to learn what can happen --even in the USA -- so it won't occur again.

Communism was a failed experiment, a potentially good concept for the Third World (helping everybody who needed medical assistance, food, shelter, etc.) gone horribly wrong.  But the Congressional un-American Activities committees also grew to become something to fear, an entity also gone horribly wrong...ruining lives, careers, and families when little or no evidence of wrongdoing, in many cases just knowing somebody at work or church or in the neighborhood, was even present.

A savage, brutal recounting of the US Government's attack against Hollywood movie-makers...and the damage done to these mostly innocent, or at least naive, writers and directors and other screen workers and their families, who were blamed for trying to turn us into Communists.

Frankly, I'm just a baseball fan.(basketball, too)..

435417,4,6302194725,"Written and directed by Irwin Winkler, GUILTY BY SUSPICION (1991) is an ""inside Hollywood"" story of a most grim nature that's inspired by actual events. It stars Robert De Niro as David Merrill, a fictitious movie director who is implicated by a friend as a member of the Communist Party.

1951 is an unsettling time in Tinseltown. The so-called Hollywood Ten have been convicted as Communists or for non-cooperation and are sitting in jail. Others called before an investigating committee ""purge"" themselves to prove they're loyal Americans by symbolically throwing their friends and acquaintances into the roaring Red Scare bonfire. Merrill is just one of several in this current round of investigations who must decide to either stand on principle, say nothing and thus get blacklisted, or betray as many people as the Committee demands.

It's an incredibly sad story of careers ruined and lives shattered in a country where an individual's Constitutional right to free thought apparently doesn't apply if he's a Communist Party member, or even casually attended a few Party meetings decades earlier.

A superior cast includes Annette Bening, George Wendt, Patricia Wettig, Sam Wanamaker, Chris Cooper, Tom Sizemore and in a very fine performance, Martin Scorsese as an openly Communist director who flees to Europe rather than satsfy the witchhunters.

Nevertheless, De Niro is wonderful as always, here playing a flawed but very focused big-time film director who is ""named"" by a writer (Chris Cooper who is very good) called to testify at the HUAC hearings.  George Wendt does a nice turn as the earnest, but nervous best friend, a screenwriter who is also likely to be called to testify.  But the women in this film are poorly written -- Annette Benning, playing the director's ex-wife, is at times too calm and cheerful, and at others just part of the darkening scenery.  Patricia Wettig, however, is in a role where her possible victimization as the collateral damage from the witch hunt can be dismissed as the result of her own psychological weakness.

The problem was, you could invoke your Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination, but they would assume the worst. And there was no such right when they asked for the names of friends. It was a terrible time in American history, and we need to remember it so that we never let it happen again.

While it wasn't moviemaking genius, this dramatization (over-dramatization, to be honest) really lent itself well to the story being told.  We're not watching real characters or even good efforts to portray real characters -- we're watching archetypes: bullying, fear-mongering, cowardice, denial, disbelief, disgust, shame, remorse, resistance, rage...

Everything is just a little too much, but it works really well for this subject matter.  When the fear of communism can grow and manifest itself as a surreal force to be wielded by politicians, then a movie that addresses it in terms of archetypes might just be the most honest portrayal there is.

Onto the media itself.  Warner Brothers didn't want to spend more than 27 cents producing/distributing this DVD, and they came in well under budget.  This is just the ""full screen"" (pan-and-scan that chops of the sides of the movie) edition.

The disc has no special features, trailers, commentaries, filmographies, etc., and the case had more effort invested in the annoying anti-theft tape and wrapping than in the flimsy cardboard cover.

I think many of the negative reviews are from people unacquainted with the era of McCarthy and his cohorts.  I had to live through it.  My family and I were affected by the Unamerican Subcommittee procedings and their effects.  The ridiculousness lasted past the 50's.  As a senior in college I was threatened by an FBI plant who was passing as a dumb college senior.  He blew his cover and failed to show up at graduation.  When he approached me I refused to believe good old J. Edgar wpoui;s be stupid enough to employ anyone as stupid as this kid.  How could anyone who had first hand contact with the minions of that great institution have dfoubted the idiocy of Hoover?  This kid proved me wrong,  when I questioned the legitimacy of his badge he pulled an automatic pistol from his pocket and removed the clip, then handed tit to me saying, ""They don't give this to fakes.""  I have never liked being threatened.  When another FBI genius showed up at my dorm to question me about my cousin, I complained to him.  The junior g-man was pulled from school and sent back to the Washington funny farm I assume.
My complaint about this film is it plays up the problems the ineffective right wing idiots like McCarthy did to other lesser humans who had nothing to do with Hollywood.  My father had a sensitive job as an elementary scvhool teacher in a backwater town in Florida.  The FBI came to his school to question him.  When he informed them he did not know anything, the brilliant G-man told him if he wanted to keep his hight profile job pushing a broom, he would cooperate like any good citizxen would or never work anywhere again.  Dad knew the power of the idiots and made some vague remarks of some intelligence.  He told the FBI he knew communists by name only and named the leading politicians of the defunct American Communist Party.
There are great Americans running aound this country still who realize they can influence a great many people through fear and loud talking.  They have changed their names from the John
Birch Society to Fox News, but they are just as dangerous.  If you want to see at least some of the harm done by blowhard politicians see this movie.  It doesn't tell the whole story, but if you didn't live through this time, you owe it to yourself to see it.",1285113600,6,2382,4.505827505827506

Hollywood movies are a money-making machine for the investors who put up the funds. The producer is responsible for running the operation, the director for producing the story. They use paid workers like actors, writers, etc. Their personal lives are seldom a concern unless it costs money. The audience for movies declined before the war ended. Hollywood had excess employees on their payrolls. The new television entertainment industry needed talent that would work for less. Those who couldn't find work in Hollywood often went into television.

The hidden agenda behind these investigations was an attack on democratic rights to make people afraid of signing a petition or organizing for political purposes (First Amendment rights). There was also an economic campaign to attack small businesses to favor corporate chains. In the 1940s most people walked to shop at local small businesses. That soon changed in just a few decades so shopping meant driving to a mall. Corporate chains sucked the profits from localities so they ended up poorer overall. You can compare your small town from the 1940s to today.",1262563200,,3307,4.9
435448,2,6302194725,"I'm so tired of Hollywood whining about the McCarthy era.  Most recently it was ""Good Night and Good Luck""; before that, ""The Majestic""; before *that*, ""The Crucible.""  They're like a dog with an old slipper it can't stop chewing.  Hollywood's thirst for victim status needs to be slaked wherever and whenever possible, but it sure does make for boring viewing.  The only thing that saves this film from total ignominy is a passel of great performances.  Contrived performances, but great nonetheless.

Note to the producers: put your talent to more worthy efforts next time.  To paraphrase a famous McCarthy era Hollywood luminary: ""Have you no shame Hollywood?  At long last, have you no shame?  The McCarthy era is dead!""",1197158400,3,724,5.016806722689076

435452,5,6302194725,"For anybody interested in the McCarthy era of the 50s, ""Guilty by Suspicion"" is a must. In an effort to root out communist subversives in every aspect of American life, especially in the government and the motion picture industry, the U.S. Congress, in 1938, formed a special investigative body called The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). HUAC proceeded on what amounted to a modern day witch-hunt whose actions resulted in several contempt-of-Congress convictions and the blacklisting of many who refused to answer its questions.

""Guilty by Suspicion"" dramatizes the terror experienced by innocent Americans at the hands of unscrupulous politicians who took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution as they were blatantly trampling on citizens' civil rights. It's also the story of one man's struggle with his conscience to do the right thing.

The film was extremely well made and the writing is excellent. The acting is top notch, especially by De Niro and Benning.

While it's a work of fiction, you can be sure it tells the true story of many people who went through this American horror story.

For anyone who thinks it could never happen here...it did.",1149552000,5,1180,5.130208333333333
435453,2,6302194725,"""Guilty by Suspicion"" is one of those ""Historical Fiction"" films that ""The Rotten Review"" just can't get out of its hair.  Historical fiction is ironic enough a term for any subject, but especially so when brought to bear against the evils of the McCarthy era.  Like much historical fiction, the ""Big Red Scare"" mixed the true and the perhaps-no-true with little regard for distinguishing the one from the other.  ""Suspicion"" so strongly enmeshes itself in the intrigue of the 50's Witch-Hunts that it's difficult to comment on the film without getting into the larger argument of their merits.  On the other hand, this is a work of fiction, with invented characters, scripted dialog and its own form of a Hollywood ending.  History being as important as ""Suspicion"" suggests - ""The Rotten Review"" wonders why it should be forced to pick for history out of its uninspired script, one that visits no new territory.

The story has noble (and fictional) Hollywood director David Merrill facing off against the House committee for Un-American Affairs long after he'd been stripped of his prestige and cozy life for refusing to name fellow Hollywood communists.  Merrill we learn is no hero - he had no interest in politics, but went to some meetings during the war when it was fashionable to support any anti-fascist cause.  But he doesn't want to name names.  Soon he's forced to work pseudonymously on low-budget Westerns, until his true name is revealed.  (His only defender, it turns out, is a Gary Cooper-like actor; even a similarly blacklisted friend played by Scorcese turns against him).  To add insult to industry, less-noble friends turn against him and name him as a communist (including a writer that Merrill had earlier refused to name to the committee).  Merrill decline works like a sort of trajectory - inevitably bringing him before the committee where scripted heroism will allow him to take an oral potshot at Hollywood-style politicians.

The other question this flick raises (that is, after the whole history and fiction issue) is this - why was this movie made?  McCarthyism has been done to death - Woody Allen tackled this about 20 years ago with ""The Front"", a black-comedy also ending with the heroic showdown with HUAC.  ""Suspicion"" seems to understand how new it's not - the script is so light on the details, it likely presumes that we already know the important stuff (good guys from bad politicians; the movie doesn't take chances by casting any popular actors in unpopular parts like those of the anti-communist inquisitors; like the communists of that era - the Witch Hunters have become ""The Other"", the faceless embodiment of anti-patriotic evil).  Also, the watching this flick, it's easy to forget that the Red-Scare wasn't focused exclusively or even originally on Hollywood at all - early targets were the armed forces and the State Department.  (For Merrill's denouement, the script appropriates the famous rejoinder by Army AG Joe Welch to Joe McCarthy.)

But worst of all, ""Suspicion"" is boring.  The story, though following well-worn trails against right-wing agitprop, never seems to be going in any direction, and reinforces nothing other than a sentiment I had before seeing this movie: Hollywood can't be trusted to document its own lamentable moments in history.",1119225600,3,3307,5.057090239410681
435454,4,6302194725,"I am a huge fan of this movie; I first saw it in history class and when I saw how cheap it was, I had to buy it.  DeNiro is superb, showing off his chops (why is it that all the DeNiro movies where he plays against type are unpopular?).  The story is compelling, and the movie is excellent fodder for students of modern US history.

The bad part is that the DVD IS cheap.  You really get what you pay for in this case: it isn't widescreen; there are no special features or audio options; to access subtitles (English only) you have to use your remote instead of a menu; and the transfer to DVD is low quality.  I wouldn't have so much of a problem with this if there were another edition where these problems were corrected; after all, bargain basement editions usually don't have too many frills.  But this is the only DVD of the film available at present, which means that we're all sort of stuck with it.

So know what you're buying; a cheap DVD.  Don't pay more than you have to for it.  But buy it anyway, and show it to your kids (well, your older kids anyway).  In our current situation, both as a nation and as members of a global community, it has a very powerful and important message to tell, and it illustrates just how expensive true patriotism can be.",1107907200,11,1265,4.2552301255230125

Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated, the sound is terrible on this!  I rented a copy a few years ago and it sounded great, but when video stores went out of business, I had to buy a copy to show to my classes.  Again, even on a volume of ""10"", one can barely even hear what they are saying.  Also, if you happen to be showing it in a classroom setting, watch it a few times before showing it so you can ""self-edit"" the cursing.  It seems no matter how kids can't hear the movie, they can always make out the cursing!*L*  There are only about three times when the cursing is too much, so I just mute it in those spots and tell the kids, in general, what is being spoken.  To re-cap, don't buy this item, unless you have one hell of a powerful hearing aide!  Great movie though.",1428364800,,951,4.333333333333333
