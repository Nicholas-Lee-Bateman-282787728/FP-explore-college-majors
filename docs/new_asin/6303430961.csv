641204,4,6303430961,"I saw this movie at a drive-in movie theater when I was a sophomore in high school.  I thought it very exciting then.  I wonder if it was loosely based on the life of Sergeant John Basilone who won the medal of honor at Guadalcanal, went home, married, returned to the fight and died at Iwo Jima.  When I saw it, it was the end of the golden age of war movies as, with all the Viet Nam war portests, Hollywood turned to more touchy-feely subject matter.  I would not term it a classic but it does have some excellent action scenes, particularly the one on Guadalcanal.",1295827200,7,568,4.280373831775701
641205,5,6303430961,"This DVD is absolutely awesome in telling the story of the 761st tank battalion with interviews of surviving members of the unit.  Even though Patton had no confidence in the negro soldier he had no choice but to request them for the battle of the bulge and beyond.  The 761st responded with stellar service beyond what was expected of them.  Our war history text books have been overly sanitized which has excluded many of the contributions of the WWII African-American soldier in their printed pages.  This video makes up for that mistake.

Thank You History Channel!",1251072000,2,569,4.885416666666667
641206,4,6303430961,"Good opening battle scene. The movie also shows the progression from young unattached soldier to married Medal of Honor recipient. The movie makes the viewer aware of how the character portrayed by Chad Everett is almost it seems embarassed by the fact he received the medal, and his sense of guilt in leaving his friends behind, to the point of resenting his soft life in the states as the war progresses. Good closing battle scene in which he finally comes to terms with his fear/nitche in the war, with the help of Gene Hackman...",1131926400,12,533,4.680851063829787
641207,2,6303430961,"I was hoping this movie would have more grit and substance but was very unhappy to see that it was a weak production with many flaws and long tedious sequences that had absolutely nothing to do with combat...A definate ""thumbs down"" affair...",1055894400,,242,4.785714285714286
641208,4,6303430961,As a former Marine I enjoyed the action drama of combat.  The island hopping campaigns of the U.S. Marines during World War II were inspirational to me.  Chad Everett played a very good part in this movie  along with Gene Hackman.  A must see movie for all Marines.,946512000,16,265,4.458333333333333

641303,5,6303430961,"""First to Fight ...We shall keep our honor clean... ""We are proud to claim the title of United States Marine."" I served in the Corps and I am a son of a Korean War & Vietnam War vet. I loved this film. This type of patriotism, humility of our heroes and sense of duty is slowly dying in our country. A time when the average Hollywood star like Tyrone Power, Jimmy Stewart and even Bradford Dillman served without question, completely willing to sacrifice their plush lifestyles simply because as Americans, they understood freedom does not come without sacrifice. It took me years to find this film again as I had forgotten the title. The same year I rediscovered it in 2012, Chad Everett sadly passed away. I recommend this film with a loud and enthusiastic ""Hoorah!""",1391212800,2,768,4.654411764705882
641304,4,6303430961,"Saw the movie when it first came out, hadn't seen it since. It is indeed a good movie, especially for history buffs like me who study the individual, from the lowliest rank ( is there truly such a thing for those who have been there?) to the highest. The quality of the movie and the acting is great. The quality of the dvd itself is excellent. My only complaint is that there were no closed captions available (I am hard of hearing these days), therefore I had to turn the volume way up to catch all the words.",1376006400,,511,4.224489795918367
641305,4,6303430961,"I bought this DVD to add to my collection of Chad Everett memorabilia, and not being a fan of war movies I was not expecting anything great nor was I expecting anything really bad. The DVD was good in both sound and picture quality considering its age, but I must admit to being quite surprised by the depth of acting. Chad Everett played a very good part in this movie along with Gene Hackman, their early careers obvious testament to the work they would produce later in their lives. On the whole a good story, with just the right intensity and build up of drama. Chad Everett's character with the help of Gene Hackman, came to terms with the realities of war and his place in it, overall bringing the movie to it's dramatic conclusion.
Overall, not bad for a war movie !",1351123200,5,773,4.4125874125874125

641307,3,6303430961,"This was an ok movie, but it wasn't great. I got the impression that the main character in this movie was based on US Marine Sgt John Basilone, who won the USCMH at Guadacanel. It was obvious in some scenes, that it was the late 1960's due to the decor, hairstyles etc.",1329177600,,269,4.1923076923076925
641308,5,6303430961,"Excellent portrayals by Chad Everette and Dean Jaegger as Marines in the early years of WWII.  Gene Hackman also does a superb job as Everette's Platoon Sergeant and later his conscience.  Everette plays a Marine sergeant having to deal with the fame that went along with winning the Medal of Honor at a time when heroes were thought to be in short supply to the people back home.  Everette flys home to a heroes welcome but finds he misses the comeraderie, the bonding of men in danger.  A fateful event sends him back into combat where reality sets in.  While you can still see the ""support the military"" attitude in the movie making, there is a sincere and legitimate effort to present a realistic approach to how men deal with fear in combat and the consequences of the choices men in these situations make.  A first rate film with some historical connections - the stories of Mitchel Paige, John Basilone, and Al Schmidt all resemble portions of the film.  All were Machine Gunners, and Paige and Basilone won the Medal of Honor on Guadalcanal.  Both Basilone and Paige received battlefield commissions and returned to combat.  Schmidt was too badly wounded to continue service and was awarded the Navy Cross.  Marines will love it while no doubt recognizing some tactical mistakes.  The general public will be surprised to see an honest portrayal of fear in combat for a film from this era.  Moderately melodramatic, it is still one of the better portrayals of Marines in combat during WWII.  I give it two thumbs up.",1313193600,,1523,4.745247148288973

7846166,5,6303430961,"I saw this movie while I was in the service. I was stationed in Long Beach California. There were many, many movie theaters in Long Beach. I saw this one at the Palace Theater, better known to servicemen as ""The Three For A Dollar"". This is a great 60's war movie. I waited for years for it to come out on DVD. The minute that it did I snapped up a copy. If you like WW2 movies then this is one that you will enjoy and have in your movie library.",1500336000,,446,3.912087912087912
