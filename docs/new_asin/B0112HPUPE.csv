7320345,5,B0112HPUPE,"I remember watching the Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour every week when it originally aired for the four year run on television. Nice to see at least two of the shows from Glen's show on this dvd.  I found Glen's voice very soothing and calming for me in my life and still listen to his music as a source of comfort when I am down.

I will admit for this Christmas Specials Dvd, the second program from 1970 is my favorite of the two shows found on this one disc. So glad these are now available and hope to see the entire Good Time hour with Glen in DVDs soon.

7320347,5,B0112HPUPE,Always great to watch Glen Campbell and hear the joy in my mother's voice upon hearing his voice. Good as always.,1447632000,7,113,4.428571428571429
7320348,5,B0112HPUPE,Wonderful shows. I sure wish all the episodes could be released in their entirety. So fun to see so many celebs back when they were just beginning their careers and to see Glen in his youth with his wonderful talents displayed on this show. He's a national treasure. Such talent!,1446940800,15,279,4.6
7320349,5,B0112HPUPE,"As a longtime Glen Campbell fan, I was delighted when these Goodtime Hour Christmas Specials were rereleased.  The show brought Campbell into the eye of mainstream America and earned him many fans. These two shows, (from 1969 and 1970 ) showcase Campbell at his best, and remind everyone of just how truly legendary a talent the man is.
They don`t make shows like these anymore because there aren`t talents like Campbell and many of his guests around these days. Check out the lineups on these two shows, Steve Martin was a writer, Jerry Reed, Mel Tillis. Cher, Shecky Greene, George Gobel, Andy Griffith, Anne Murray, and Paul Lynde,  just to name a few.
And, above it all, Glen Campbell. Call the family in,put the DVD in, sit back and prepare to be ENTERTAINED. This is truly a Christmas gift from times gone by back to touch your heart, entertain you and remind all of us of what a true genius Glen Campbell  is, and was.",1445817600,21,925,4.593939393939394
7320350,5,B0112HPUPE,"This is a MUST BUY for any Glen Campbell fan - and frankly for anyone who loves classic Christmas music mixed with good old time comedy !! Besides Glen doing his hits and mixing in some great Christmas songs, this DVD also guests Anne Murray, Cher and Andy Griffith singing Christmas songs as well. You also get crazy hijinks from George Goebel, Mel Tillis, Paul Lynde, and Jerry Reed !!

Its great seeing these complete episodes again !! I remember seeing these as a kid ages ago !

These are beautifully mastered - crisp, clear and vibrant video !!!

You will not be disappointed !!!",1444780800,36,585,4.552380952380952

This was a time when country  music  was at its peak,  all these guys made there mark in country music, just to see their live performances is a treat.",1487462400,2,440,4.265060240963855

7320425,3,B0112HPUPE,just a little too much comedy,1472774400,,29,4.0
7320466,4,B0112HPUPE,"What an incredible guest lineup in just one show, Johnny Cash with June Carter, Merle Haggard, my all time favorite, Buck Owens, Jerry Reed, Freddy Hart and Mel Tillis. There are some really good musical performances.

Cash/Campbell - Folsom Prison Blues
Haggard - Carolyn
Cash - A Thing Called Love
Campbell/Reed - Born To Lose
Hart - Easy Loving
Owens - I'll Still Be Waiting For You
Campbell - For The Good Times

I felt the comedy skits with Mel Tillis and Minnie Pearl though were quite weak but I enjoyed Merle Haggard's impressions of Marty Robbins ( Mary), Hank Snow ( I'm Moving On), Buck Owens ( Love's Gonna Live Here) and Johnny Cash (Jackson)

The final medley was also entertaining though we only get to hear a few lines of the following songs

A Boy Named Sue
I've Got A Tiger By The Tail
When You're Hot You're Hot
I Want To Go Home
Act Naturally
I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am
Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man

It's too bad that we only get to see 1 episode 50 minutes, not really good value for the price being charged, but these are some of my favorite country singers of all time, it was nice to see them once again !.",1472774400,14,1140,4.2592592592592595
7320467,5,B0112HPUPE,I've always loved Glen Campbell and remember watching the Goodtime hour as a kid. This episode has so many great country stars as guests. Sadly most of them aren't with us any more.  The show is entertaining and all of the artists have more talent in their pinkie finger than most of today's artists have in their entire body.  It's nice to see the episode in its entirety and not cut up clips. I just wish they'd release all of the episodes.,1468540800,10,442,4.378048780487805
