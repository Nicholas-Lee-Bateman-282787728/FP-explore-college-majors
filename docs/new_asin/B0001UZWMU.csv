2025021,5,B0001UZWMU,"If you want to see how the Battle of the Alamo (Texas vs. Mexico) should have been fought, then watch this movie.
This film's battle scenes at Orleans are very reminiscent of the Alamo battle.  Just replace muskets with crossbows.
I like how the English throw rocks down upon the French.  Smart move.  You don't see that in the Alamo films.
I also like how you see the English and French use body armor and shields.  You don't see that in the Alamo films.
The actor playing Captain La Hire (Ward Bond) does a great job, and brings some comic relief.
I like how Charles VII calls his close adviser. Tremoille, his ""Loving Crocodile"" for charging him huge interest on personal loans.
=====================
What did Darth Gator (Tremoille) say to the Dolphin Charles?  ""Fluke, you are my fodder.""
What did Jacques D'Arc (D'Arc Vader - Joan's dark father) say to the Dauphin, Charles VII?  ""Fluke. I am your father.""
Was Jacques D'Arc the father of Charles VII?  I believe he was. Thus Charles VII was from the royal house of Anjou and thus a descendant of the kings of Jerusalem (King Fulk).  Is it any wonder that King Charles 7th quickly ennobled the Jacques Darc family line?
SIGNS this is so (the number 22):
(1)  Jacques Darc was 22 years old (birth year 1380) at the conception of Charles 7th in 1402
(2)  Charles 7th was born on Feb 22, 1403
(3) Charles 7th died on July 22, 1461.",1493251200,,1384,4.522088353413655

Ingrid Berman gives an overwhelming, and humbling portrayal of Joan of Arc. This is definitely a masterpiece. The end is very saddening and worse to know she was killed by the Catholic Religion.

2025038,4,B0001UZWMU,"The role of St. Joan is the one Ingrid always wanted to play. Unfortunetly she was not happy with the results,and the film was not widely accepted by the critics of her day. She felt the film came off too artsy and over glamourized:not real enough. The films failure as she saw it, and being feed up with the limitations within the hollywood system, ultimately lead her to seek the direction of the neo-realist Roberto Rossilini in Italy. I myself think this movie is pretty good because of the charming performances of Bergman and Ferrer ,as well as the stunning Technicolor cimematography. The only film during Bergmans early career ,except For Whom the Bell Tolls to reveal Bergmans full beauty with those piercing blue eyes.",1452038400,3,728,4.832
2025039,4,B0001UZWMU,"Having see the VHS version first, I liked it somewhat better than the version that had been released on DVD (the VHS runs 100 minutes, whereas the DVD is 146 minutes). I am sure if I were to watch the DVD more I would probably come to prefer it, however.
Having known most of the dialogue on the VHS by heart, I was rather thrown off when I saw the DVD and was thinking to myself ""What? Where did that come from?"" A lot of the dialogue that had been cut for the VHS version was from the very beginning of the film, too.

In the meantime, I think I will be keeping the VHS as well until that version is released on DVD.",1451433600,,618,3.9838709677419355

2025054,5,B0001UZWMU,"This version of Joan of Arc is superb.  She puts everything into it and then some.  She portrays the Maid of France with dignity and humility and in the end is tormented with not knowing what was expected of her.  At the last moment, she is visited by her saints and then knows what her destiny will be--heaven and eternity with the Lord.

2025055,1,B0001UZWMU,"I regret to say, I do not have much of anything good to say about the particular DVD of ""JOAN OF ARC"" which I, myself, received. I give it a one-star rating, though, to me, it doesn't even deserve that. But, I give it one star because it's better than nothing at all. I did not receive the DVD version that was issued with the cover as shown on this Review above. I have seen that version from renting it from my local Public Library. That version is very good and it was the kind of version and quality I was expecting to get. It was a cleaned-up version and the cinematography was clear and colourful and everything. But, for this DVD/Film which amazon.com advertised, for a common DVD price of around $15. (give or take), it is a Korean-marketed version. The cover has mostly Korean on it.  Now, I really don't mind that so much, as long as the DVD or Film itself is good. But, it isn't. The good things about the Korean-version is the quality of the plastic case and the cover design is okay. but, beyond that, as far as the meat and potatoes of the Film/DVD, the visuals are ""fuzzy"" and the colouring is horrific. You can hardly make out the images. I mean, you CAN, but, not as readily. The colours bleed into each other like a bad watercolour. I was so initially disappointed that I wanted to just throw it away and count my money as a loss, and another ""lesson learned"". But, I kept it only because I love the Film a lot and I can't, at this point, find a good version of it anywhere else to purchase for my own, that is without paying an exorbitant amount. I am not paying $80. for this DVD when it ought to cost no more than any other common DVD. I would not recommend this version I received to anyone. Sorry on this one, amazon. Usually amazon sells good quality products, or has good quality ones sold through them. But, this one is an absolute bomb, to me. Like I said, I am keeping it. But, once I find a better quality version at a decent DVD price, I'll plan to purchase that and I will get rid of the one that I just bought. If I want a bad watercolour, I can paint one myself blindfolded.",1398038400,,2107,4.215346534653466
2025056,1,B0001UZWMU,I believed the film to be the long version of the film (about 150min) but the cover says it is the short version of 100 min approx,1393200000,,130,3.8518518518518516
2025057,5,B0001UZWMU,I always loved this since I first saw it. Ingrid Bergman was such a great actress. I also loved her in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness. Be sure and get the longer version of Joan of Arc. There's a shorter version somewhere. This one fills in the gaps.,1383868800,,250,4.122448979591836
2025058,1,B0001UZWMU,"I had seen this movie before.  However, I ordered it after seeing the full version on TCM (which they do not sell).  The Amazon website had a number of offers with all the reviews seeming to be about the ""full"" version.  Yet my order was of the severely cut version and of poor quality at that.  I feel the it was a ""bait and switch"" and hold Amazon responsible for not clearly stating which product was what on their website.  By putting all the products together where the reviews were enthusiastically endorsing the long version alone was completely misleading and I feel dishonest.",1380326400,7,585,4.640776699029126

2025061,2,B0001UZWMU,"This review is NOT about the movie Joan of Arc but about the quality of the DvD from this particular source (NTSC - ALL REGION Play / IMPORT from So. Korea].  The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the movie itself is good but the video of the DvD is beyond the pale.  It's horrid.  It really looks like someone recorded it off their TV, the start of the movie there is what seems to be a little camera shaking and the rest of the movie just looks bizarre and unreal.  I don't know how else to describe it but I watch old movies all the time and have never, even before restoration, come across something that looks so bad on screen.  My initial reaction was ""someone recorded this off their TV"" but I watched the whole movie anyway and it just confirmed my suspicion. I ended up returning the DVD and hope to purchase this movie again but not from this source.",1369872000,5,875,4.2155688622754495

2025063,1,B0001UZWMU,"This movie should have won an award for being the most anticeptic and historically false presentation of an historical figure in the history of Hollywood. One step away from being a cartoon everyone in peace or war wears clean and neatly pressed clothing, has impeccably brushed hair and remarkably clean faces, and travels over an unruly nature that looks suspiciously like a well tended Zen garden.
For intelligent and convincing drama about Joan of Arc look elsewhere! This one will make even the few Catholics left in church head for the doors!
Much wasted talent and, I seem to recall, an ill-timed career venture for Ingrid Bergman, one of my four favorite actresses, who was involved in a sex scandal at or near the time this movie was made.",1360713600,4,748,4.8062015503875966
2025064,4,B0001UZWMU,"It's nice someone is making this movie available on DVD. It was getting hard to find with most copies on new ($$$) or used VHS tapes. This is a fresh and official (not pirated) copy of the movie. The Korean subtitles can be turned off and the soundtrack is the original English.

This is the first Joan of Arc movie I ever saw. A couple of new ones were made in 1999 and have better effects and battle scenes, but I've noticed they both borrow a bit from this original version, in particularly the ""good soldier"" from Joan's inner circle who looks like a wall and has the same character, as well as her regrets over the post battle carnage.",1352937600,2,640,4.333333333333333
2025065,5,B0001UZWMU,"This DVD is the full length English language restoration of the classic 1948 Joan of Arc film with Ingrid Bergman and Jose Ferrer.  Korean subtitles from this licensed version can be suppressed on setup for showing on standard U.S. DVD players. Bergman is absolutely superb as Joan.  What she says with her eyes, her head and arm movements, and her interactions are more powerful than words.  Yet the script is also powerful, making Bergman a very plausible French army leader who in actuality became a heroine of France today.  As far as I have been able to detect, the film, although partly fictional, is faithful to what is historically known about the life of Joan of Arc, including characters, places and events.  A map, shown early in the film, is useful orientation to events that span France. While Joan had nationalistic objectives, she was driven by religious visions and inspiration that led to improbable leadership of a ragtag army of peasants that was victorious in difficult battles including a well portrayed battle at Orleans, turning the tide in the 100 Years War.  While she was burned at the stake in 1431 for heresy under charges brought by a bishop, efforts by French Catholics brought her recognition as a declared saint in 1920.  She would have drawn a salute from General Patton, who commanded the U.S. Third Army upon some of the same ground 500+ years later, for her courage, loyalty and leadership. Director Carl Theodor's interpretive efforts in this film result in a story that could be used for leadership study today.
  The U.S. importer or distributor of this film deserve a word of thanks for making the product available at reasonable cost. To me, the film has an inspirational quality that is infrequently seen in Hollywood products.",1351987200,9,1769,4.909395973154362

2025067,5,B0001UZWMU,I would recommend this DVD to everyone.  I have seen several versions of this story but Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of Joan is the best of the lot.  It has the proper religious connotation that makes the story believable.  The cinematography ( Camera angle shots )especially the scene when Joan was in the jail before her execution was full of emotion. The yellow and black shot of Ingrid Bergman's profile is just an exquisite piece of work from a true professional.  This may came from the 1940 era of movie creations but it can not be equalled in terms of dialogue and acting quality....10 out of 10.,1337904000,11,602,4.650943396226415
2025068,5,B0001UZWMU,I am a History Major.  This film gives excellent background knowledge of Europe during this Era. It gives insight into the people and cultures.

2025069,5,B0001UZWMU,"This is not merely a movie.  It's entertaining, but it's much, much more.  If you think that courage is a great Christian virtue, then this is a movie that you will treasure.  An absolutely magnificent supporting cast powerfully backs up Ingrid Bergman in her finest role.  How that one woman overshadows such a powerful cast is a study in acting all by itself.

Ths story is ageless.  An illiterate peasant girl from nowhere in France responds to a godly call and literally changes the world.  Saint Joan reversed the course of the Hundred Years War, forever ended English ambitions on the Continent, and invented the concept of nationalism.  She also knew about things that she could not humanly know, displayed compassion for those who hated her, and exemplified courage and composure in the face of the most vile of enemies.

On the other hand, if you want a disney-like, straight-up 50's style hero-worship flick, then you're in good terms here. Also, if you want to spend a couple of hours admiring Ingrid Bergman, who was a cutie, after all (is it wrong to get goofy over a saint?).

2025074,5,B0001UZWMU,"This is just a beautiful depiction of the life of one of God's saints, Joan of Arc.  Ingrid Bergman is inspirational. I love movies and television, but pretty much nowadays you can't watch anything without sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and a serial killer.  It's so refreshing just to see something that is just pure and lovely and good.  I love the way it depicts Joan trusting God and putting her life on the line for Him.  And I love the last line of the film, which I won't give away.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to walk the walk of faith and trusting in Jesus.",1206489600,10,570,4.339622641509434

But this is such a phony movie with no relationship to any reality that has ever existed.  I'm a sucker for 'Hollywoodization' when it's as good as Casablanca, but this is almost as poorly produced as an unrehearsed college theater production.  An astonishing example of moviemaking at its most unconvincing.  Please don't waste your time on this drivel (but that's just my opinion!)",1184630400,2,542,4.723404255319149

2025078,5,B0001UZWMU,This is the first version of Joan of Arc I viewed as a young girl. It is well done for the time period. Ingrid Bergman is fantastic as usual. I would recommend this movie to anyone.,1173312000,3,181,4.055555555555555
2025079,3,B0001UZWMU,"I was looking forward to seeing this film until I learned that it was a heavily-edited version of the original theatrical release.  That one is 145 minutes in length but this one is only 100.  I have to believe those extra 45 minutes were somewhat important for the telling of the story.  The result is still watchable, but it has a ""rushed"" feel to it.  If you are familiar with Joan's story, you might be surprised at how quickly this film reaches its climax.

Bergman is great as the larger-than-life Joan of Arc, emerging from the  peasant stock to lead the French army into battle.  Joan's story is still remarkable to this day, and Bergman does it justice.  The film also manages to stick to the historical record, even including many small details.  The events at her trial, the words Joan spoke at her execution, even what the executioner supposedly said when Joan died, these were all included in the film.

Overall I gave this three stars.  I would recommend skipping this and watching the full version, but if you can't find it, this one is better than nothing.",1171065600,5,1072,4.619047619047619

2025081,4,B0001UZWMU,"We are in 1429, period of the ""Hundred Years War"" between France and England... The story follows the well-known outlines of the short life of the 15th century French saint, Joan of Arc...

Guided by divine Voices, the visionary daughter of a plowman, Joan (Ingrid Bergman), wearing men's clothes, leaves Domremy her village town in Lorraine and takes her long journey to Chinon to meet the Dauphin Charles VII (Jose Ferrer).

Inspired by God to free France from the ravages of the invading English, the peasant girl persuades the indecisive Dauphin to recruit an army and run out the ruthless invaders clearing the way for him to be crown King of France...

Joan leads the French Army to victory over the English forces at Orleans and stands proudly besides her king - as she promised - at his coronation in Rheims' Cathedral...

The Maid's followers believed that she came from God and the Burgundians and English were stricken with fear at her success... But Charles was tricky, ambition and deceitful in his goals... A counterplot was at work as a mean truce is suddenly signed with England, frustrating Joan's zeal to rid France of the enemy...

In an ironic twist of fate, the Maid of Lorraine becomes a political prisoner... She is closely guarded and kept in irons, and is tried as a witch by an English-dominated church court...

With no council to aid her, except her Voices, we see the intrigued illiterate girl, pitted against Bishop Pierre Cauchon (Francis L. Sullivan) trained in all the complexities of legal exhausting questioning...

We may ask ourselves how so many ideas and intuitions are to be found in a person so simple as she was saintly... Joan is, above all things else, the wisdom of a good people... She is the people of France, the plain people of the countryside of Lorraine which is sweet and clean through the courage and faith of the people as much as through the smell of woods and orchards...

Ingrid Bergman portrays with deep conviction her role as the delicate innocent virgin who raised the spirit of the French to hope for better times... She curbed savage England and stopped the spoiling and burning of France... Bergman's smiling face invoked spiritual revelation, the required light of a charismatic true heroine...",1167696000,8,2259,4.864583333333333
2025082,3,B0001UZWMU,"Victor Fleming's Joan of Arc, even in this beautifully restored version, isn't much to write home about. Maxwell Anderson's play was creaking at the timbers even in 1948, and the screenplay remains resolutely theatrical despite one good battle scene. Ingrid Bergman is okay in her quiet moments, but handles her big declamatory scenes with extreme clumsiness - it's one of those performances where you can all too easily spot where she's marked her script, and too often it's more about hitting artificial cues than giving a fluid or convincing reading. If anything, you find yourself wondering why her nose looks so big all the time and marvel at how the more inspired Joan is, the more Swedish she sounds. Instead, the film belongs to Jose Ferrer, making a remarkable debut as the weak and feminine Dauphin. It's watchable enough, but there's a cosy feeling about the film: even the burning at the stake seems more photogenic than horrendous. Still, it's fun to see Dennis Hoey playing something other than Inspector Lestrade for a change!",1145750400,,1041,4.988505747126437
2025083,5,B0001UZWMU,"This DVD version is of the highest quality, both in its texture, colour and lighting. Ingrid Bergman played Joan of Arc with as much reverence and solemnity as she did in the Bells of St. Mary's. She wore a very short hair, not unlike her look in ""For whom the bell tolls"". She looked convincingly young, brave and strong to shoulder such a daunting task of fighting against the Burgundians and English. The major battle scene, though not shot at actual site, was engaging nonetheless.

Joan of Arc's convictions and determination led her people to victory. But what was true then is still true now. Leaders have the final say. Coronation of a short-sighted and corrupted king underlied the tragic end of Joan of Arc. And Ingrid Bergman had the depth and sophistication to handle the agony, frustration and disappointment when she was later betrayed by her own king, then captured by the enemies and in the end faced the grand trial. She revealed her struggles - at one time she submitted when she could hold out no longer; and came to peace only when she accepted her destiny. That all said, the movie was tragic and thought provoking.",1143244800,6,1136,4.708542713567839
2025084,3,B0001UZWMU,"For those of you who've seen Maria Falconetti in the 1928 French silent picture THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, you will no doubt feel disappointed in this movie starring Ingrid Bergman. Although the earlier movie focused only on her trial and execution, this update covers more of her life, but with much less verve and fervency.

Bergman is the maid of Lorraine who convinces the Dauphin (Charles VII) that divine voices have commanded her to lead the French army against the English. Bergman has a bewildered look about her that is always on the verge of becoming hand-wrenching: there is little strength of character behind her (one assumes she would need plenty), except for maybe in the one battle scene. In fact, that scene is just about the only rousing thing in the whole picture.

The burning at the stake climax, where passion is absolutely required (and where Falconetti achieved screen immortality) is reduced by Bergman to tears and talk. At least they restored the thing to its rightful 145 minutes; the cut version (which is what the VHS copies are, usually), which was 45 minutes shorter, was a travesty (the cuts were done so crudely you could actually see where they were made). Skip this and track down the silent picture with Falconetti if you want to see a great screen version of Joan of Arc.",1133568000,5,1311,4.745614035087719

2025086,5,B0001UZWMU,"I remember seeing this film on TV during the 60s and 70s and could not understand why the story line was disjointed.  Now I know why.  After Ingrid Bergman scandalized herself during post-World War II America, audiences boycotted this film in droves.  Finally, after all these years, this film has been restored to its former glory.  It is a must-see for those of us who fell for this lady's beauty and dignity.  This film has all the greatness and sweep of Gone With The Wind.  Bergman's performance will bring tears to your eyes.  She is surrounded by a great cast with Victor Fleming in his directorial farewell.  Filmed in superb, old-fashioned Technicolor.",1124150400,8,661,4.839285714285714
2025087,3,B0001UZWMU,"They have a way in this movie of making 15th century Europe look a lot less bloody, sexist, lusting, and filthy than it really was. Nonetheless, already having known a lot of the real Joan's life I found this film to be reasonably accurate and it goes down seriously but still easily enough. Recommended!",1119398400,4,304,4.648148148148148
2025088,5,B0001UZWMU,"Ingrid had always wanted to play Joan of Arc and it truly became her show. This is a stupendous film and Ingrid is a radiant Joan, giving an extremely moving performance. Everything about this film is beautiful:  Ingrid, of course, the photography, costumes, and an excellent quality film with a cast of great actors.
I have only one fault with this film.  It is NOT a completely restored original-length.  There is one scene missing from the DVD.  It is the scene in which Joan is captured.  The DVD shows she was captured and brought before the Duke of Burgundy. She is on a brown horse with her hands tied behind her.  That is all.  It does not show HOW she was captured.  That scene was omitted from this DVD.  Here is the omitted scene:  -After the battle of Rheims, she rode out to defend the town of Compiegne against a new offensive by the Duke of Burgundy.  She commanded a successful sortie against the Burgundians but was outflanked by English reinforcements and forced to retire. Protecting her rearguard while they retreated over a bridge, she was forced into a field, where she was pulled from her horse by a mob of Burgundian soldiers who were keen not to hurt her, as they hoped to claim the ransom money.
-What a shame this scene was omitted from the DVD.  However, it is a great historical film. With Ingrid Bergman as Joan, it is a must see.

2025089,5,B0001UZWMU,"I found this movie a delightful representation of St. Joan D' Arc, Patron Saint Of France.  I have always loved St. Joan, and have found this movie to be wonderfully informative on her life.

She was truly a grand and excellent person and all because of God giving her a very special vocation- that of saving France!

I highly recommend this film - 5 stars!!!!!",1099872000,2,361,4.523076923076923
2025090,5,B0001UZWMU,"For my birthday I received the new DVD of Victor Fleming's 1948 Technicolor production of ""Joan of Arc"" starring the ever radiant Ingrid Bergman.  Image produced the DVD and the UCLA film archive spent years restoring the film and putting in all the footage trimmed from its original 146 minute release.  Many of us saw a shortened and doctored print of this film on television growing up.  I did not know than that the film had not only been cut down, but additional footage, including the maps showing Joan's journey had actually been added along the way.  This edited version was released on VHS by Sterling Video and on Laserdisc by VidAmerica.  Both editions have been unavailable for some time.  I managed to rent the Laserdisc after reading another review that said it featured the ""shorter version"".  It corresponded to what I remembered watching on TV so it dawned on me that I had never seen the entire film.  I assumed the rest was probably lost and I never would, but thanks to the painstaking efforts of the UCLA film archive with help from the Motion Picture Academy, private collecters and even (according to the insert) a film museum in the Netherlands, we have the complete film magnificently restored.  Ingrid Bergman turns in a wonderful perfomance along with Jose Ferrer, Cecil Kellaway and host of other well known faces from that time.  George Zucco even has a small part as captain of a border guard and for once does not play a heavy.  Ingrid Bergman caught some flak at the time for playing against type herself as her own personal life came under scrutiny.  Despite this she was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award.  The film won three Oscars including a special award to producer Walter Wanger, Cinematography and Costume Design.  It was also nominated for Supporting Actor-Jose Ferrer, Art Direction, Film Editing and Score.  Thanks to Image entertainment for bringing yet another classic gem to DVD!  Make some popcorn and enjoy the show.  Thanks!",1096502400,48,1983,4.854166666666667
2025091,5,B0001UZWMU,"If you have been disappointed by the 100 minute video of JOAN OF ARC in the past, you will be delighted with this original version.  This is the same version that I saw in 1949, immaculate and with nothing added or subtracted.
Anyone who knows anything about Saint Joan of Arc is deeply disappointed by the 100 minute video version which cut many parts essential to understanding Joan's complicated story.  The full length version fills us in on the historical background through clever dialogue, portrays faithfully scenes from the trial in Joan's own words and best of all draws us in to the exciting, courageous and saintly life of one of history's unique figures. The brilliant colors and exquisite costumes make the film a visual feast!  Ingrid Bergman's captivating performance reflects the profound affection that the actrice felt for Saint Joan.",1086739200,10,853,5.035460992907802
2025092,5,B0001UZWMU,"First of all, let me begin by saying this is not ""A"" Joan of Arc movie, this is ""THE"" Joan of Arc movie--unexcelled and unsurpassed by any movie made before it or since.  Millions of dollars and painstaking attention to detail were invested in this grand epic to ensure that it was truthful and true-to-life down to the minutest detail.  The events, clothes, and portrayals were all garnered from the the current records and historians of the day (for example, we have the entire transcript of Joan's trial).  Ingrid Bergman dutifully and extensively studied St. Joan in an attempt to accurately capture her mulit-dimentional personality--unlike modern portrayals which are either inconsistent with the historical records (showing Joan to be crazy) or flat, wooden, one-dimensional portrayals.
  Fans of this movie will shudder to know that the studio almost destroyed this great film by butchering it to death.  It was a misguided attempt to get more people to come to the theater to see it.  There was nothing wrong with the film in it's original incarnation.  It simply was released at a time when Ingrid Bergman was unpopular in the American press due to things in her personal life.  The studio's cutting and re-editing of this film almost caused us to lose it in its original form for all time.  Prints had to be brought in from overseas to restore it.
  I know I've been waiting for years for this great classic to be restored and re-released and I'm finally glad it has been.",1085875200,35,1483,4.841269841269841
2025093,4,B0001UZWMU,"This DVD hasn't been released yet, but from the details that are supplied it looks to be the complete  theatrical roadshow version that has been unavailable in the US, at least, for  35 years or longer (I have faint memories of seeing this on TV, in two parts, in the Sixties).  Finally!  I understand that this has involved a major film restoration project and will hope that the technical results have been worth it, since this is the best English-language Joan of Arc film to have been made, still.  (More recent films have been marred by slipshod performances, weak scripts, and dubious historical accuracy at best.)  This movie has been previously released on home video in a criminally butchered 100-minute version and even that is long out of print.
This important movie belongs in the collection of anyone with a serious interest in learning something about the life and career of Jeanne d'Arc.
Update, May 21, 2004:  The DVD is available now; I have viewed about half of this so far and can report that it is a spectacular job of film restoration.  The colors are vivid and distinct, the image sharp, and the soundtrack clear and distinct even in its monophonic mix.  This 56-year old Technicolor movie looks like it was released last week.  All the fantastic detail work in the backgrounds, costumes, and matte paintings is clearly visible and Ingrid glows more beatifically than ever before.  (She may not be the definitive screen Joan, but she was certainly one of the most sincere in her approach.)  The DVD includes no special features but a box insert briefly describes the history  of the film's production and  restoration.  A superb job for this deserving epic.",1079654400,41,1679,4.842105263157895
8016501,2,B0001UZWMU,"A flawed, would-be epic that could'a/should'a been a lot better, given that it had Ingrid Bergman being directed by one of the all-time greats, Victor Fleming. Alas, this is a wordy, stilted and suffering saga of the infamous clairvoyant, who could see herself as the victor of France, just not its martyr. Some interesting visuals, marred by some tragically short-sighted rear projection. Blu-ray transfer is imperfect too - inconsistent grain, periodic mis-registration of the 3-strip Technicolor and weaker than anticipated contrast.  Wouldn't waste my time on this one again. Certainly, would not waste my money. It's 2018, folks. Send a message to distributors and studios. It's time they made a more concerted effort to restore and remaster their back catalog for future generations to enjoy and not simply slap it out in whatever condition it currently exists.",1524614400,,867,5.328467153284672

8016505,3,B0001UZWMU,"Joan of Arc,"" based on the Maxwell Anderson play Joan of Lorraine, stars Ingrid Bergman (Casablanca) as the French religious martyr and war heroine. The film is the story of the 15th century peasant girl who rouses a nation and inspires the world with her faith and bravery. Fiercely believing that shes directed by God, Joan triumphantly leads an army into battle against the British, who are driven from France. As Joans intelligence grows, the king (Jose Ferrer, Moulin Rouge) becomes increasingly wary of her power and ultimately betrays her.

Though Ms. Bergman turns in a spellbinding performance, the film has its problems. It lacks the visual variety that movies can bring to a work and is often stagey in its compositions. Dialogue is stiff with many performances coming off as overwrought and theatrical. There are a few outdoor establishing shots, but most of the film is shot within the studio, giving the movie a claustrophobic feel. Cinematographer Joseph Valentine provides some beautiful compositions, with many shots looking like paintings by the masters. The overall production is lavish, with a cast that includes Ward Bond, J. Carrol Naish, Gene Lockhart, Leif Erickson, Cecil Kellaway and Shepperd Strudwick, who also serves as off-screen narrator. The film was directed by Victor Fleming (Gone With the Wind).

Through the years, the movie was cut and re-edited, but this is the original 146-minute version, newly restored. Joan of Arc was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Actress (Bergman), Best Supporting Actor (Ferrer) and Best Scoring (Hugo Friedhofer).
