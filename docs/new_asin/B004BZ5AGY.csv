4320776,5,B004BZ5AGY,"These are WONDERFUL movies, great quality and substance!!!!  What a fabulous way to spend a rainy afternoon.  The acting in all four movies is superb.  I wonder why I hadn't heard of some of them before but they do not dissapoint.",1349740800,12,230,4.560975609756097
4320787,2,B004BZ5AGY,"I was disappointed that the four films came on 2 cds, unlabeled. Further, Dangerous Liaisons (my reason for ordering) was captioned, bright yellow, in English. There was no menu for this film, or chapter, set-up, etc. For me it distracted from the costumes and sets, a big draw for me in this film. I have bought similar 4-packs before, and each one came on its own labeled disk. I have watched The Painted Veil and Silk as well. These were both good quality in terms of sound, image quality, etc. Dangerous Liaisons was made much earlier (before digital), but was decent given this.",1442188800,4,583,4.669902912621359

4320789,3,B004BZ5AGY,"The Painted Veil was the only movie really worth watching IMO.
Dangerous liaisons was somewhat amusing.
Silk and Affair of the Necklace put me to sleep.

All in all considering the cost not a bad deal.",1439337600,3,201,4.583333333333333

THE OTHER 3 MOVIES I HAVE NOT WATCHED AS YET. NEXT RAINY DAY! GREAT PRICE FOR A 4 PACK OF MOVIES. FAST SHIPPING. I RECOMMEND.",1432339200,,287,3.8

4320819,5,B004BZ5AGY,"After reading the mixed reviews I really had no idea what would be shipped out to me when I ordered this set. You can imagine my pleased surprise when I opened the package and found there were four movies on four discs. I have no idea how I got lucky on this one but was pleased with what I got.

I've played portions of all four discs and found they all have very satisfactory audio and video. The audio all seems to be surround sound and of good quality so I am very happy with that fact. For the record, I'm an audio/video hobbyist and really appreciate it when the audio and video are part of the solution and not part of the problem.

All four discs are sandwiched on a single spindle so you would have to remove three discs if the movie you wanted to watch was the fourth one in the stack. I do not classify that as a major problem in view of the incredible bargain price for the set. Of the four we have only previously watched ""The Painted Veil"" but that one alone is worth the price of the set so I see the other three movies as a free bonus.

For the record, I have uploaded a photograph of the four discs.",1401408000,18,1116,4.0867579908675795
4320820,4,B004BZ5AGY,"Quality of images, Audio were very good despite bargain priced CD's. Provision of subtitles were helpful to follow plot closely. All of  selected CD's were popular titles, good value for viewing several titles in one pachage, very slight difference noticed from HD version.",1392940800,6,273,5.348837209302325
4320821,3,B004BZ5AGY,I think I saw one of the movies and thought okay four for the price of one but I wasn't as entertained by the other movies.,1380672000,,123,3.769230769230769

4320823,1,B004BZ5AGY,I wish I would have known how terrible the picture quality would be. I can't even stand to watch it. I gave it away.,1373414400,2,116,3.875
4320824,5,B004BZ5AGY,"It is worth purchasing this DVD for only the movie ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and I have yet to watch the other three movies but will update this review when I do.",1371427200,,157,4.266666666666667
4320825,5,B004BZ5AGY,"I bought it for one of the movies (Silk), but I watched another (Painted Veil) and I loved it.  I can't wait to watch the other two movies - what a great deal.",1357516800,4,159,3.8181818181818183
4320826,3,B004BZ5AGY,"I have no qualms with any of these movies.  In fact, I liked the Painted Veil the best.  What I didn't like so much were the two discs that had one movie on each side.  I know that it's a bargain-price movie package, but couldn't they at least have two movies on the same side?  It's annoying when you put in a movie only to realize that it's the wrong movie and then have to take out the DVD to flip it to the right side.  Otherwise, it's a good movie set, although, I would try to get these movies on their own.",1355961600,7,513,3.941747572815534
8422510,5,B004BZ5AGY,"I just watched Silk. Excellent quality watching the first of the 4 movies.
I have no doubt that the others will be of the same quality. Four movies for the price of one - can't beat that, and am looking forward to watching Painted Veil and Affair of the Necklace - both of which I saw years ago, but are favorites of mine.",1516406400,,322,4.126984126984127
8422511,3,B004BZ5AGY,"Great movies but the cd's don't have their own individual slot inside the case, they are just all piled together. Other then that great movies.",1492646400,,143,4.76

8422513,5,B004BZ5AGY,"I stumbled upon this DVD by searching for The Painted Veil. I watched that movie and absolutely loved it. Such incredible performances. During my Amazon search to purchase that movie, I found this 4 in 1 deal. I was a little skeptical since I had never watched the other 3 movies. However, I can say that each movie was excellent in its own right.",1478304000,3,347,4.4375
