8421949,4,B004BF0DTS,Shaadi No. 1 is a milestone film- actually a U-turn film with which Mr. David Dhawan has relaunched himself into the genre of over-the-top comedy with minimum sense and maximum words. Needless to say the film is not worth seeing even once and reasons are many- 1. If you have seen Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya or even of them you could be having great expectations with this one and you would not feel anything sort of irritating disappointment.,1301270400,,463,4.658536585365853
