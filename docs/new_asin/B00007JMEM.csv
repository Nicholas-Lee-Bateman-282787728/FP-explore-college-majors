7977044,2,B00007JMEM,Has everything you would want in a workout but something was missing,1505952000,,68,4.75
7977045,4,B00007JMEM,"I have a number of her DVD's and actually didn't purchase this one for myself, but as a gift for someone so I'm not sure if the contents are exactly like the one I have at home  with the same name. However, if you don't have any of her DVD's, you can't go wrong. They're my ""go-to"" exercise dvd's when I don't want to go to the gym. I like the fact that you can mix and match your routines so they don't become tiresome. Only 4 stars because I didn't actually play this one, but  I'd give 5 stars to all the ones I have..",1402876800,,521,3.9056603773584904
7977046,5,B00007JMEM,"Awesome Price, Fast Shipment awesome seller!  Great workout DVD.  I have liked Sharon Mann's workouts for quite some time and is good for not too strenuous workout with great results.",1396396800,,183,5.066666666666666
7977047,5,B00007JMEM,"I started to use this when I was pregnant and due to some issues I had to stop running. It helped me get through that time without getting too bored, I don't normally like to exercise at home, but this made a big difference.",1391990400,,224,4.113636363636363
7977048,5,B00007JMEM,"i like sharon mann. ITs great that u can pick the kind of workout u want to do, we are not always in the same mood.",1360195200,,115,3.4615384615384617
7977049,5,B00007JMEM,I absolutely love this dvd. I used to workout with Sharon Mann when I had fittv. EVen though the workouts are only about 30 minutes you work really hard. She is motivating and positive about pushing yourshelf as far as you can. I love the fact that I can choose what I want to do each day. It's great variety. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to work hard in about 30 mintues. It will definitely make you sweat. Sharon Mann has incredible energy that transfers over to you as you workout. Great cardio workout!,1216339200,,521,4.381443298969073
7977050,1,B00007JMEM,"I was very dissappointed in this DVD. It advertises ""1000's of Hours"" but you can only program 20 minutes of cardio at a time.  I have other customizable DVD's and you are able to program at least 45 minutes of cardio. Because of the misadvertising, I give this 1 star",1197331200,,268,4.36
7977051,4,B00007JMEM,I love the cardio DVD. My favorite workouts are the kickboxing and the hi low. I think it was a great investment. I do her every other day for my cardio and have enjoyed it!,1153785600,,173,3.9714285714285715
7977052,1,B00007JMEM,"A couple years ago I bought her complete box set from my local video store. I LOVED her workouts! I never got bored and I reached my target weight in only 5 months. It was great for the winter months. However, after a couple years of use, 2 of the 3 CDs got scratched so I reordered them from Amazon.
However, the since the time I bought them, they have redone the cover design and it is evident also the quality of reproduction for the CD has been compromised. The new versions don't work properly in my dvd player. I even went out and bought a new dvd player after Amazon shipped me a second set of videos which didn't work. The problem didn't go away. Basically, they either don't read, or when they do read in the player, the menu doesn't work right or the video skipps. Very dissapointing since I actually looked forward to working out with her.",1124668800,8,850,4.31875
7977053,4,B00007JMEM,"I have had this for a month, and I still love this DVD. I like the ability to customize the workout. It's very innovative to have so many options on one DVD. Somedays I really don't feel like jumping around all over the place so it's nice to be able to eliminate those types of activities and concentrate on something different without switching DVDs. Sharon is very easy to follow, and isn't as giddy as some other aerobic instructors I've used. I also love how the people in the background do adaptations of what Sharon does so that if what she does is too easy, you can just look at the people to the right and kick up the pace a bit. Also, if you need a low-impact version you look at the people to the left. Very cool.",1091664000,16,723,4.2086330935251794
