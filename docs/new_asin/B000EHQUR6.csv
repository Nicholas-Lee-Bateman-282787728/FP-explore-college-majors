8109889,5,B000EHQUR6,"I purchased Spiders & Snakes, Beetles & Spiders and Animal Atlas: Creepy Creatures for my 3 1/2 year old grandson.

He delights in them--the facts are presented in an entertaining format that keeps his interest while he's learning.

Well worth the price.",1334880000,,254,5.023809523809524
