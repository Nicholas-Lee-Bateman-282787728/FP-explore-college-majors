This DVD is well-produced and very generous and even a bit daunting in length--plan on breaking it up over a couple days to prevent your brain from over-heating.  There are lots of extras too!

While the technique section is for beginners, the choreography and combination sections are for more advanced dancers--not so much for the moves as the lightning-fast pace!  She transitions from one step to the next very quickly and I am not smart enough to remember 32 counts worth of steps after one run-through--or disciplined enough to pause and rewind--I just muddle through and end up rather confused.  Hopefully the plethora of ideas offered here sink in somehow!

Also the title of this DVD is misleading--""Entrance"" made me think that this was all going to be about different ways to make a grand entrance--""Clever Combinations"" would've been a more accurate title.

Beginners--just do the technique section and watch her performances and then shelve this one for awhile.  Advanced dancers--you are going to want to buy this one and watch a few times for some great choreography ideas.",1369872000,,1193,5.108247422680412
8260881,3,B001652FLU,"The main problem I had with this dvd is that I was expecting some entrance choreography in it. I mean that is the title of the dvd. The only reference to entrance choreography in the whole dvd is a few sentences in the introduction about how important the entrance is. That's it! The rest of the dvd is technique, combos and you learn two routines. But none of it has anything to do with entrances. I kept looking for it. After all that was why I ordered this dvd. So frustrating.

As a instructional dvd with a choreography that is fun to learn, this is a top rate product. But if you are trying to work on your entrance for performance purposes (as I was) this dvd will be a big disappointment.",1240963200,10,696,4.2727272727272725
