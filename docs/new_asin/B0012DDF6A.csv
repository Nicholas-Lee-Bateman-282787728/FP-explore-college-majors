They were no doubt a big influence in me becoming a bodybuilder, as I always dreamed of being the hero that saves the beautiful girl. My girl and I enjoy this one in particular, because the stars favor us in appearance. It has plenty of adventure, heroics, and romance. These films, in my opinion, are good for kids as well, because they instill values like integrity and courage. Much better than the drivel children are exposed to today.
