8188515,5,B000P296EY,Basically a Rita Hayworth fan so had to get this as well.  What more I can say?  One thing is I don t like these 20 words review!,1313712000,,129,3.5714285714285716
8188516,1,B000P296EY,Glenn Ford is not in this book. The film is grainy and hard to make out faces.,1288656000,,78,3.6470588235294117
8188517,4,B000P296EY,I first saw this on a local PBS station and loved it. The way it is filmed enhances the storyline and creates an almost dreamlike experience.  Note that Rita Hayworth and Glen Ford are NOT in this film; I don't know why Amazon insists on listing them as primary actors to the exclusion of all those who are primary.,1220745600,11,315,4.338983050847458
8188518,4,B000P296EY,"The style is traditional. Performance is great. The female dancer emerged a bit late. Her style is just as fierce as the guys, not particularly feminine and pretty. She's great though. The guitarist is amazing.",1207008000,5,210,5.0285714285714285
8188519,4,B000P296EY,"This is a 55 minute concert of a flamenco performance in Los Angeles.  The music, from a dozen musicians, is first class, and the dancing is solid and sometimes flashy.  The show is designed, in some way, to reflect the old movie ""Gilda,"" starring Rita Hayworth.  The flamenco film is worth the money, especially because of the music.  But someone decided to make it ""arty,"" and throughout the 55 minutes there are fades into ""old movie"" format and some slow motion shots, both of which are likely to rob you of your eyesight.  Does not the director know that anyone can buy a DVD of Gilda on which the movie looks brand new?  In any case, the filming seriously detracts from what was a fine performance.",1206748800,6,704,4.5476190476190474
