8069535,4,B0009XFIM8,"Introducing ""Atomic Betty"", a high-speed, girl-powered, action/adventure series that will definitely blow your mind !  This series is about an average little girl with a big secret.  (I mean, don't they all ?)  This girl, however, is really a space fighter known as a Galactic Guardian.  With her trusty spaceship and loyal crewmates Sparky and X-5, she makes the universe safe from vile villains like her archnemesis Maximus I.Q.

This DVD has eight of the best episodes from the show.  ""Atomic Roger"" is about a show-offy Galactic Guardian who gets all the credit than Betty.  That's because she has a horrible hairdo, and Roger has better looking one even though it's practically fake.  ""The Doppleganger"" is about a villain named the Chameleon who can change into anything and everything.  Two more episodes, ""Furball for the Sneeze"" and ""But the Cat Came Back !"", involve Betty's troublemaking pet cat Purrsy.  In one episode, Purrsy gets on Betty's ship giving allergic problems for Sparky.  In the other, Purrsy makes a mess of Betty's room every time she is called for duty in her Galactic Guardian position.

The best thing about this DVD is the swingin' music video of the theme song sung by Tajja Isen, the voice of Betty.  This song and many others can be found on the soundtrack of the show.

Bottom line, this is definitely one of the neatest series seen on the Cartoon Network.  You won't be sorry.",1135900800,4,1413,4.829166666666667
