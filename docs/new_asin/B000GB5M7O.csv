8130266,4,B000GB5M7O,"Liz Nord shot this film in 2003 for a 2005 release. Jericho's Echo looks at the microcosm of the Israeli punk scene, taking place in a country slightly smaller than New Jersey. It's a scene that seems open to all varieties of punk subgenres, like a community center where all the quote-unquote punks get together and listen to whatever band is playing. Far from being the only deviance from the norm in a land both extremely religious and fiercely secular, the punks are so pretty much by choice and not circumstance. There's everything in Israel from death metal to lounge music to rockabilly. Punk has the most obvious political component, and the film spends the bulk of its time in the socio-political arena.

Jericho's Echo has five sections: it establishes the punk scene, jumps into personal and national politics, explores life in a country with mandatory military service, separates the punks from the religious nature of the country, and then ponders life in a war zone. The punks you meet are mostly young and a mix of Middle Eastern, European, American and Russian Jews, and some talk like they just got off a plane from Oregon. I want to restate that these kids are for the most part not victims of society. They're not capitalists in Cuba or any such thing. They're like kids in Berkeley, CA leading a hippie anarcho-punk lifestyle. Punk seems for some an accessory to their liberal politics - the same ones found in Maximum RockNRoll. They wear the same t-shirts, screw with their hair just like American mall rats, and play the same music in their bands. The film's promoted with ""Rebellious Israeli youth take up the arms of punk rock, loud guitars, and mohawks in the most politically charged area of the world. Through interviews, verite' scenes and live musical footage, we see how these well-spoken and outspoken kids deal with life in their explosive, ancient region"", but it's not alien to any all-ages scene in the US.

There's one politically right band shown (they're not religious) and the rest are solidly left, against globalization, media and religious control, the militarization of Israeli society, and genetically modified foods. They're for human and animal rights. They wave banners for Amnesty International and Foods Not Bombs. They blame leaders on both sides for the fighting, bloodshed and occupation, and hold out hope that non-violence is the only answer. The difference between American lefty punks and Israeli lefty punks is that in Israel they know the stated goal of their enemies is for each and every one of them to be slaughtered in a holocaust that would make Hitler look like Mr. Rogers. Arab schools teach children Jews are descended from pigs. Suicide bombers kill as many as they can in cafes and buses. The Israeli punks are not spoiled, angry children like those in America - they know who hates them and what they would do if given the chance. The Israeli punks are hoping for negotiated settlements and finally peace. They're not suicidal like American punks are nihilistically genocidal (in the name of peace, of course).

There's mandatory military service from 18 to 21, and some of get out of it by acting crazy. It's more likely they're seen as untrainable putzes not worthy of the process of whipping them into shape. A lot of time is dedicated to explaining the nuances of what it is to be Jewish and Israeli. It's a culture, a religion and what you are because of what your parents are. It's like a whole other country over there but they try to let you know being Jewish and Israeli is not a big deal in the bigger picture.

Jericho's Echo is a decent example of guerilla filmmaking in the fairly safe danger zone called Israel. There's nothing controversial going on and no police hassles beyond the normal mistrust of the young, dumb and full of fun. The only real lesson of the film is that it's a small world after all.",1292630400,,3890,4.784226190476191
8130267,5,B000GB5M7O,"This was a powerful film, full of insights we are not often given the opportunity to see & hear. These thoughtful, sad, ironic comments come straight from the punk musicians and their fan base in Israel. Filmaker Liz Nord has an uncanny way of getting straight to the heart of the challenges these kids face when they turn 18 and are required by law to enter the army. Watching the kids try to follow their hearts & their consciences is a remarkable journey & Nord does a spectacular job of staying true to her mission of showing us their plight. Often heartbreaking as the musicians talk about their goals in life, their losses & their deep feelings about their country, this film is a must-see for anyone who has ever struggled with life-altering decisions.",1154390400,,759,4.6716417910447765
8130268,5,B000GB5M7O,"Yes, you get a soundtrack that you can bang your head to.  Yes, you get kids with spiky hair and spiky things through their body parts.  But you also get so much more - commentary from a largely secular movement in a largely religious society, thoughts about militarism and resistance, personal stories about fallen friends...  Liz Nord does a great job of sharing the fun and chaos of the punk scene in Israel along with the reality (and chaos) of the context which these punks are challenging with their lifestyle and their music.  A keeper for any punk at heart.",1154044800,3,565,4.62
