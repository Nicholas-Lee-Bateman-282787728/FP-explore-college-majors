2697782,1,B000KWZ1QQ,"save your money.
almost anything is a better use of time than to watch this poorly written movie.
The dialog and plot are so thin and unbelievable so as to pose continuity and coherence issues to the audience.
besides that it isn't even a decent love story or action flick.
strikes out on everything it attempts.
big waste of time.",1188345600,2,331,4.533333333333333

8159195,4,B000KWZ1QQ,"I'll be perfectly honest - I wanted to watch this movie because Anson Mount was in it.  I love him in Hell on Wheels and have seen just about everything he has been in.  While this isn't one of his best efforts, I enjoyed the movie and don't regret watching it.  Even if Anson Mount had not been in it, it still had a very strong supporting cast, was well acted, and had a quick moving and easy to follow plot line.  It's not a movie I will watch repeatedly, but it's a nice addition to my library.",1438300800,2,498,4.051020408163265
8159196,4,B000KWZ1QQ,"I enjoyed this movie because Anson Mount was in it. Once I discovered him when watching ""Hell On Wheels"" I went to find out what else he stared in. I read the ""Hell On Wheels"" reviews and that is how I found out about some movies and other TV series that he did.  So I purchase several of them already along with this movie.  If he didn't star in this movie, I wouldn't have watched it twice. It seemed like the timing was off in this movie.  Maybe it was the Director of this movie. There were good and bad parts.  But like I said, I only purchased it because Anson Mount was in it. He also did the movie called ""TULLY"" in the year 2000. This was a very good movie.  I really enjoyed it.  It made me cry. He was in his twenties then. He just turned 42 in February of the this year. He also did the following movies:  ""The Two Mr. Kissels"" w/John Stamos base on a true story and Seal Team Six: The raid on Osama Bin Laden. There are more movies and TV series he did.",1431302400,2,966,4.0
8159197,4,B000KWZ1QQ,Seeing the young Anson Mount was worth it. The machinations of the legal system pass most of us by. Some of their work is just boring paperwork ad infinitum while someone else gets the big score.,1417219200,,195,4.444444444444445

8159199,5,B000KWZ1QQ,"Great acting, and on a subject that happens in real life. You have a hero who saves the day.
Anson Mount plays a very convincing lawyer who wins his case in spite of amazing hurdles.",1395360000,2,182,4.228571428571429

8159201,3,B000KWZ1QQ,I liked it it  It was in good shape and came in a reasonable time so i'm happy with it,1372896000,,86,3.3
8159202,4,B000KWZ1QQ,"I bought this DVD because I'm a big fan of Erica Leershen.  The movie is o.k. not the best thing out there, but it kept me entertained, and Erica Leershen does a fantastic job in it.  The other actors are not as good, but I like I said I bought it for Erica, so I am happy with it.",1322697600,2,281,3.7457627118644066
