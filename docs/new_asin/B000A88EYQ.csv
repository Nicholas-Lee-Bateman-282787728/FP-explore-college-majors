Beat the Clock was the forerunner of Minute to Win It, and the homemade quality of the original show makes it more fun for me.

What's Your Bid was new to me, and while it starts out looking like a train wreck, it quickly becomes amazing. Why would someone bit $4500 in 1952 dollars for some ugly furniture? You'll find out!

Break the Bank and Who Do You Trust are more standard-type quiz shows, but the young Johnny Carson makes his show special.

Amazon's description of this disc is wrong on two points: Each of the four shows is nearly a full half hour, making the run time more like 120 minutes. And there is no 5th show on the disc--even though the disc box says there is.",1305676800,,848,4.314465408805032
