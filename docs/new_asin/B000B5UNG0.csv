He make funny remarks, even though it is a serious matter. His work is outstanding at the end. I am going to get all of his seasons. Looking forward to the Hi-def widescreen seasons.",1297987200,,324,4.416666666666667
2401934,5,B000B5UNG0,"Even thou I am not a homeowner at this time, watching Mike is so helpful being aware what is needed to do, to ""make it right"" He is a caring man who helped out people with all kings of home problems from doing add-ons and re making a place that he knows the owner will just flip over,
""Holmes for the Holidays"" is the best of this season, the first and 2nd seasons had mainly all 30 minute episodes ( about 22 minutes with the ads taken out) Holmes for the holidays was an hour show ( 44 minutes without ads) where in two months time he takes this home that could have fallen down, and completely re-builds in time for the holidays.
If thinking of buying a home, or wish to re do yours  buy this or other seasons and be amazed at what you can learn, while watching a truly caring man and his crew help people all over ( in Canada near where he lives)",1206144000,8,850,4.059523809523809
2401935,5,B000B5UNG0,"I stumbled across this show on cable and found it great.  These are quick to watch but very interesting and informative.  Puts the rest of those home improvement and DIY shows to shame.

I had to order seasons 3 and 4 off the Holmes on Homes website.  Every season is great.  I learn something from every show.",1167436800,5,310,4.368421052631579
2401936,5,B000B5UNG0,"Not only is Mike Holmes a polite, knowledgable, hard-working, handsome, contractor his also a hero to many. I can't recall a show in recent memory that I have enjoyed watching more than Holmes on Homes. Plus, I learn something new everytime I watch. If you own a home, plan to buy or build one this show is a must see.",1155945600,8,318,4.316666666666666

8082029,5,B000B5UNG0,"Education at its best! Very practical information presented in semi-real-life. If you haven't seen Holmes do a home inspection, you are missing an interesting view of a very important task. You WILL learn from each episode, pretty much guaranteed. If you are looking at purchasing a home anytime soon, get this series, watch this series, study this series. It will open your eyes, and make you a much smarter buyer.",1417996800,,415,4.942857142857143

8082031,5,B000B5UNG0,Holmes on homes is one of the better home improvement shows. It shows some of the shady tricks some contractors will pull when doing a job. I find the show helpful when I plan remodeling on my house.,1411516800,,199,4.2631578947368425
8082032,1,B000B5UNG0,"I purchased this DVD because i enjoy carpentry and building in general, i was hoping i could get some tips on improving structures. The show has mild profanity on it so its not suitable to watch with the family (if you don't cuss around your kids, why would you watch a TV show that does?)  The second episode was for a Gay couple, and from what i have read, they are not the only gay couple to be featured on his shows. Considering that less that 5% of the population is gay there is a suspiciously high percentage of Gay couples featured on this program. They obviously have a point to make. I wanted a show about fixing houses, i can do without the social engineering added in. My copy of this show is now in the trash can after watching one and a half episodes.",1380585600,2,765,4.239726027397261
