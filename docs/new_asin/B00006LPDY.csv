1785519,5,B00006LPDY,"Ah, where to begin with Tobacco Roody. One of the more underrated films of 1971, this hillbillies-n-hayseeds flick nevertheless deserves its own special place in '70's rural americana pop culture. I have never seen a movie quite like it and likely never will again. A very strange but ultimately enjoyable film, it manages to somehow be charming despite its shoestring budget ( Hey, you gotta love any movie that features the opening credits in paint on the side of a barn!) and features a wonderfully silly-for-the-sake-of-being-silly script.

Basically, the movie traces the events in a single afternoon in the lives of a group of country bumpkins in the small, rural, West Tennessee farming community of Tobacco Roody, whose horniness and libidoes are exceeded only by their sheer stupidity. Among the host of characters are main protagonist Farmer Mose, his niece Tootie whom he displays lascivious (and incestuous) affections towards, his bored wife and two sapphic-tendencied daughters, an easily distracted sheriff, a trio of brain-dead hayseeds and even an inexplicable French tourist girl (!?!) for good measure.

Somehow these characters all come together in this zany plot, if it can truly be called that. Of course, it all amounts to LOADS of bare skin and some surprisingly graphic sex scenes. In fact, there's so much nudity and sex in this film that one get's the impression that there's not very much else to do in Tobacco Roody but get liquored-up and make love, aside from farming and making moonshine. It's not exactly porn, per se, but it's pretty damn close. Easily earns its X-rating.

So what made this film work for me? Well, aside from the prerquisite gobs of nudity, it also has a charming, unmistakeable early '70's vibe, some genuinely funny scenes, some really stupidly funny lines and is also hilighted by a very good soundtrack featuring several Johnny Cash songs. The dvd is a nice one, too, and the video transfer is an impressive one. The movie hardly shows its age and I never once got the impression that I was watching  a truly shoddy or poorly-made motion picture. For a low-budget movie, it is actually made quite well and you can tell the filmmakers put a definite sense of fun into making it.

If you like to laugh and don't mind the occasional insult to your intelligence, do yourself a favor and see Tobacco Roody. You might lose a tiny bit of respect for yourself afterwards, but chances are you'll have had a fun time doing so.",1182643200,32,2472,4.890214797136038
1785520,5,B00006LPDY,"NUDTY!!!The clothes come off quick and often. Wow. The best something wierd video I've ever seen. Good looking girls big boobs, lots of bush. Its great! Both movies have alot of nudity even some quick spread eagle shots. The second film ends with a nude beauty pagent. All the girls from the movie get naked! Full Frontal. The sex is lame and very fake softcore, sept for alittle quick guy to girl oral. As far as story, lots of lame jokes and stupid plots. But it didn't matter cause all these girls like to get naked. Highly recommended!",1150070400,52,539,4.510204081632653
7971816,5,B00006LPDY,"NICE!! These films have been around for decades, and I only recently discovered them on YouTube! Where have they been?? I don't recall seeing them on VHS in the 80's/90's!",1390435200,,171,4.733333333333333
7971817,3,B00006LPDY,"I purchased a bunch of these Something Weird dvd's a while back and found them good light entertainment of a bygone adult nature...tame by today's standards, but fun in their hoakyness.",1340323200,,185,5.0
7971818,5,B00006LPDY,I played Tobacco Roody and Midnight Plowboy at my theater in Ohio. I was busted showing them. Today they are mild and not near pornographic. More female nudity than what I remembered but they are comedy films and fun to watch.,1311552000,,226,4.536585365853658
7971819,3,B00006LPDY,"it is a low budget movie, and it shows, but you get what you pay for in this movie, not much",1304294400,,92,3.4285714285714284
7971820,5,B00006LPDY,"This is a GREAT book for those who are looking for true T&A
It's loaded with great shots and no one will be disappointed.
Try it",1303862400,,128,3.9615384615384617
7971821,4,B00006LPDY,"Let me start here: ""Warning-This program cuntains nudity, sexual situations, and some of the dumbest characters ever seen on film"". That disclaimer is printed on the back of the case and it means two things-truth in advertizing and a lot of fun. The girls are cute (remember this is the 70's so no silicone or shaving), the dialogue is lame, and the plot-wait what plot no that was another movie! Kinda hard to rate this as a whole-Tobacco Roody is a 5, Southern Comforts gets 4 (coupla kinda crude bits), and the ""extras"" are pretty much just filler, I doubt you'll watch them more than once. So that's why we rated it only 4 overall. For this type movie and at this price go ahead you can't go wrong!",1295827200,2,702,4.449612403100775
7971822,5,B00006LPDY,"There is something in retro porn that appeals to me. As a teenager, I have been influenced by movies that I picked from my dad's shelf when I was home alone. I definitely find this movie a lot more entertaining than most modern porn movies...
Both movies have dumb plots but they have been worked with a twisted mind that make them so sexy and fun. I love the nude scenes, there are tons of them, full frontal, natural. My preference goes to Southern Comforts, so many girls!
There is also this fantastic voyeuristic perspective that you can't find in modern movies, may be the new generation find it silly. I definitely find it great!
The only negative point: some erotic scenes are too long to my taste, but its not a problem, I just fast forward and keep enjoying!",1273536000,3,767,4.485714285714286
7971823,5,B00006LPDY,I am a fan of vintage/ cult films and I think this is great!  We have the ability to see and view adult content without the government telling us as leagle adults what we can view.  It's very campy and funny and down right good old fashion love making at it's finest (given the times- the mid 60s' and 70s').,1247011200,3,308,4.116666666666666
7971824,5,B00006LPDY,"Both Tobacco Roody/Southern Comforts are pointless and plotless ""Hillbilly"" movies with really goofy acting BUT with a ton of hot and young naked girls. My personal favorite is Dixie Donovan.

As always with Something Weird, there is a ton of bonus material on this DVD. You get 11 theatrical trailers featuring more ""Hick"" themed movies: Bad Georgia Road, Bootleggers, The Farmer's Other Daughter, Hillbilly Hooker, Hot Summer in Barefoot Country, Man and his Woman, Miss Jessica is Pregnant, Preacherman, Preacherman Meets Widderwoman, This Stuff'll Kill Ya!, and The Year of the Yahoo!.

There are two short subjects: Hillybilly Bride and Take Me Back to West Virginia. You also get Harry Novak's Gallery of Exploitation Art with Soundtrack Greatest Hits along with audio commentary from Harry Novak and, I believe, Johnny Legend.

Of course Harry is absolutely hilarious and never ceases to point out the color of the girl's privates along with the ""bobbing"" action of each girl's stomach during certain scenes.

Early 70's Harry Novak Hillbilly Soft-core brought to you by the ""weirdos"" at Something Weird Video. Can't get no better than this!",1229126400,12,1148,5.256830601092896
7971825,4,B00006LPDY,"Something weird has some ""weird"" videos out, that's for sure.  Some are good, some are not so good, and some are bad.  There're different though.  That's what I like about them.  They got some hot babes coming on strong with the sex scenes.  Bring it on.",1216771200,4,254,4.434782608695652
