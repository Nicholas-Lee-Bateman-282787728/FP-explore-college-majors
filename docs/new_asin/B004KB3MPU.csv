4396324,5,B004KB3MPU,I realy enjoyed this movie. I will watch it again. I feel that it realy gave me an insight into Falco's life.,1345680000,2,109,4.0
4396325,5,B004KB3MPU,"I really didn't know what to expect. Some cheesy made for TV movie with bad acting? Not at all. This is more like a quality Indie gem that does an excellent job of telling the life story of Falco. Its a story, as one might have guessed, of sex, drugs and rock and roll. You see the struggles of trying to make it big, of the want for success in the U.S., of reaching the top and the realization that everything will be judged on your past success and the fear of being a 1 hit wonder. Its all here, the rise, the fall, the family drama, and some real tragedy too. You don't have to be a Falco fan to enjoy this movie, anyone interested in pop or rock music and the lifestyle will be interested. Also includes some great Falco songs, his U.S. hits and those in Germany.",1338336000,7,768,4.126666666666667
4396326,5,B004KB3MPU,"Many times after I've seen a biopic on someone famous I've admired or loved that has passed, I become disillusioned, disappointed and all the interest, adoration and/or fascination I had disappears, in some cases their music becomes less interesting to me as a result. This film didn't have that affect. This was very well done, and true to character as the Falco I understood via his music. Apparently he was just as he presented himself to us, but kept the emotional side to his private life in a way many have failed to achieve, yet expressed it in his music flawlessly. I don't know if the director was a fan, but it definitely feels like it. In any case, I very much enjoyed this pic and would recommend it to any Falco fan. It's brilliant and the actor, Manuel Rubey, portraying his highness, was bloody fantastic.",1330819200,2,820,4.623287671232877
4396327,5,B004KB3MPU,"Well, this story does not surprise me at all. Behind every talented music star there are sad and tragical stories.

Addicted to booze and drugs, involved with a lying woman who dragged him into a destructive relation, being the son of a dominant and possessive mother, Falco has all the planets aligned to become the greatest German speaking singer and an definite star of the 80's and 90's.

Falco's music is much more than those very hot hits he put in the charts.

The actor who plays him does it good (he has a light resemblances to Johhny Depp) and I only criticize his poor moves on the guitar or bass.

The cinematographic language (colors, texture, photography) is just the perfect one!

I feel happy for having watched this movie, but somehow I feel sad for knowing Falco's story.

Long live to the greatest German singer and 80's star!!!!",1325980800,4,848,4.657718120805369
4396328,5,B004KB3MPU,"Falco always starts the party...and now a dvd about his life...perfect!  Some might now like this movie, but if you're a fan of Falco, you should at least watch it.  It has all the popular songs.",1318377600,3,195,4.388888888888889
4396329,5,B004KB3MPU,"The company that released this dvd gets 5 stars all on its own. I bought the dvd and it plays on my dvd player, has subtitles as well. The movie is definitely worth watching if you're a Falco fan. I'd urge you to rent it first to see if you like it enough to buy. I thought the movie was wonderful and the actor playing Falco did a great job.",1307145600,,342,3.9
8432674,4,B004KB3MPU,"I'm being generous with this review because the film itself is a very good biopic. The acting is solid. The pacing is excellent. The plot is great. What a disappointment then when I had to fast forward one part of the video because the DVD bogged down and then skipped. As I was playing this on an elderly Panasonic TV/VCR/DVD unit it's hard to point a finger at the DVD. But other DVDs I have purchased, even previewed DVDs did not have this issue.

Fortunately there was only one skip on the DVD and I was able to view the video to the end with no other issues. The disk is not eligible for return and will most likely end up as a coaster because of the playback quality. View this product immediately to ensure quality is the point being made here. That way you can return it within the standard Amazon window.",1487635200,,813,4.313725490196078
8432675,5,B004KB3MPU,"Great acting & storyline.  Gives you a sense of the personality and the times.  Not so much of the creative process, but that's not what this movie is about.",1477958400,,157,4.379310344827586
8432676,5,B004KB3MPU,"This is a very good movie, not cheesy as I thought it might be.  A very well made and respectful biography of Falco.  The e lead actor is without tremendous, totally capturing Falcos essence.  The recreations of familiar videos is startling in authenticity.",1464912000,2,257,4.930232558139535
8432677,1,B004KB3MPU,"I stopped watching this film after about a half an hour.  This film did not focus on the creation of the music or the man behind the sound, but rahter portraying him as a man who was only interested in wealth and sex.",1456617600,2,217,4.046511627906977
8432678,5,B004KB3MPU,Awesome movie. Love the attention to detail.,1449619200,,44,5.428571428571429
8432679,4,B004KB3MPU,"This made-for-TV German language film (with English subtitles) is a very good look at the broad outlines of Falco's biography, from childhood to his several rises and falls and ultimate downfall (the last bit filmed on location in the Dominican Republic). It was much better than I was expecting and I would recommend it as an important part of any Falco fan's collection.",1441065600,4,372,4.920634920634921
8432680,3,B004KB3MPU,I felt Falco's music is much better than the movie impressed on me.  I enjoyed the movie and I'm glad I bought it and plan to watch it again.  I am a hugh fan of Falco.,1435795200,4,168,3.638888888888889

8432682,3,B004KB3MPU,"I am a huge Falco fan so as soon as I discovered this movie I had to see it. I really enjoyed it. It begins by showing us a moment of Falco's final day alive and with someone who lived in the area giving their take on the events leading up to his death. From there it takes us back to his childhood in Vienna and gives us a basic but vital layout of how he grew up and what a talented child he was. From there taking us to pre fame days where he was playing bass for one band that I do not remember the name of and also Drahdiwaberl. Where when given the chance to sing he was finally discovered and the meteoric rise Hans ""Falco"" Holzel began.
It is a very well done movie and excellently acted as well. The most major issue being that the fellow who plays Falco is an actor and not a singer. He just can't execute on the songs and for me at least it would take me out of it for those moments. They should have dubbed him for the singing. He actually does do a wonderful job on Rock Me Amadeus though. The only other issue I felt was that they missed the humor of the man that could so clearly and easily be seen through interviews and his videos. They focused too much on the drama and tragedy which is why I only give it 4 stars. Otherwise though I think it was a beautifully put together construction of events and what a complicated man he was. He couldn't deal with the demands, he was often arrogant to a pure fault, I'd say had difficulty dealing with his immense talent, he couldn't truly relate to people. I love him all the more after this for ways I can relate but just being able to see the human that was in his faults and beauty. I highly recommend this film to all who love his music and music buffs. A truly epic adventure and well worth it. Loved it.

Update 4-7-17 I'm on my third watching of this film and each time I just have more issues with it as I'll do my best to cover them. First the good, it is a well made movie. The acting is good and all technical aspects are excellent. I still like the movie and not all of my previous points above are wrong by any means. First Manuel Rubey is a good actor, he absolutely cannot sing and every time he does I am ripped right out of the story because it's Falcos beautiful and great music ruined by a mediocre voice at best. Without a doubt he should have been dubbed. I love Falco beyond just his music. Man talk about taking the good humanity out of a man in this biopic. Yes he could be as arrogant as they come and be an ass. This movie though makes him look like he has negative people skills or charm. Watch interviews, interactions etc. on YouTube and various places and you see a man just overflowing with charm and great people skills. A problem I have that's in most places right now is that after his '88 album Wiener Blut no other works in whole get mentioned. This fiml especially should talk about Data De Groove and Nachtflug which were released before work on Out Of The Dark in the early to mid 90's. Just too much negativity in this film. Like I said many of my points above are valid and true but this is what's missed. I love the man and his music and want a movie that gives us a better and real picture. Down from 4 stars to 3.",1417392000,3,3216,4.0886075949367084
8432683,5,B004KB3MPU,"Great flick of Falco's life. I wasn't aware just how many tunes he wrote and sang. Love most of them, even though only a few became popular. It's a Shame his life ended so tragically.",1366156800,2,183,4.257142857142857
