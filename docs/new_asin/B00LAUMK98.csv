8664895,3,B00LAUMK98,"A selection of seven segments of ""Life in Hollywood"" which were shown in cinemas in 1927.  Nothing very exciting or illuminating but for people interested in the sights (no sound as these were silent films) of early Hollywood there is enough material here to entertain and amuse.  Amazing to see how many studios were operating at this time although most views appear to be from across the street or over the back fence. There are some inside shots of Universal City, Warner Bros., M-G-M and glimpses of such obscurities from the past such as  Christie Comedy Studios, Metropolitan, Educational Comedies and Pickford-Fairbanks.
Lots of stars and directors on show although most studio scenes appear to be staged for the camera; obviously the attempt at keeping the mystique of Hollywood at the forefront for the audience was paramount in these short subjects.
As you would expect from such an obscure collection, the picture quality is not great but more than watchable and the music soundtrack provided although a bit monotonous is in keeping with the sounds of the twenties. Thanks to the Alpha people for digging up this old curiosity piece.",1410393600,,1144,5.010526315789473
