7351305,5,B012G7INVC,"If you are open-minded then you may find this to be funny and romantic. This a reforming of love and sex addicts (in actual psych definition). It was a little different story than I would have guessed from the trailer. Do not listen to the other reviews- they kept you guessing and the last 15 minutes was not what I had expected.

Not for anyone that can't sit through watching adultery and promiscuous sex.",1451001600,2,408,4.513513513513513
7351306,3,B012G7INVC,"Sex is a popular way to sell any product, including movies. Not surprisingly, it's how Sleeping with Other People parts you with your money. Act I: smart, fast-paced, and progressive (like NYC, the city it was shot in), and contains no shortage of humor. I didn't recognize Alison Brie until she pouted, and then I saw Trudy Campbell shine through. As if Mad Men had not been enough to convince us that Alison Brie is awesome, Sleeping with Other People further emphasizes the point. And if the lingerie scene of her isn't enough to make uptight people even more so, there are plenty of other scenes that will. Jason Sudeikis is more annoying than usual, but he seems to click well with Brie. The script is almost airtight in Act I, and Sudeikis throws down lines from the script as if he's in a poetry slam.

At precisely 15 minutes in, you know how Sleeping with Other People will end... but this doesn't mean the enchantment ends early. Act II, which becomes sickly sweet and decelerates the pace significantly, doesn't begin until about 2/3 of the way in, so you have ample time to feel the illusion of something new happening in the genre before what seems to be a rebuke of the Act I. The fatal flaw is this: The people who would have liked Act II will probably be somewhat repulsed by Act I (so won't even keep watching until Act II), whereas those (like me) who thought Act I was watchable will feel let down by Act II.

Final thoughts: If you don't mind a bait and switch, it's not a horrible flick. Take it or leave it, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than date night.",1449792000,,1593,4.4520547945205475
7351307,5,B012G7INVC,"I fell in love with the characters in this movie, not only was I laughing a lot but I even cried a couple times. The dialogue was perfection there wasn't 1 dull moment.

7351308,4,B012G7INVC,"""Sleeping With Other People"" (2015 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Jake (played by Jason Sudeikis) and Lainey (played by Alison Brie. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""2002"", and Lainey is in trouble in her dorm at Columbia, but bailed out by Jake. They hit it off, and wnd up losing their virginity to each other that night. The movie then skips to ""The Present Day"", and we see Jake fighting with a girl because she cheated on her, while Lainey is confessing to her boyfriend that she cheated on him, At a AA meeting for sex addicts, Jake and Lainey run into each other, not having seen each other since that night in 2002. What will become of them? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the second feature length from director Leslye Headland, who previously brought us the excellent movie ""Bachelorette"", She also wrote the script. ""Sleeping With Romantic People"" is a sex comedy with a romantic angle to it, but to be clear, there are a lot of sex jokes in this movie, some fairly crude and/or graphic, so if that is something that might bother you, please check out a different movie. That said, the jokes rarely make you laugh out loud. A chuckle here or there is more like it. The funniest scene for me was when Jake teaches Lainey how to pleasure herself, by using an empty juice bottle. Just watch! The second part of the movie eases up on the sex jokes, and instead plays out the will-they-or-wont'-they (get together, that is) part of the plot. I also should mention that Adam Scott is almost unrecognizable in his role as Lainey's other love interest. The good thing is that there seems to be a real chemistry between Sudeikis and Brie, and that helps the movie a lot. Besides the musical score (composed by Andrew Feltenstein and John Nau), there are a ton of song placements in the film, mostly indie bands (OK Go, Miniature Tigers, The Echo Friendly), but there is also David Bowie's ""Modern Love"", which plays as Lainey is teaching young kids how to dance. Priceless.

""Sleeping With Other People"" make quite a splash at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. The movie finally opened this weekend on three screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I had seen the trailer, and was interested in seeing it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater was not very well attended. I can't see this movie lasting long in the theaters, to be honest. The movie isn't bad, but neither is it so compelling that the much needed word-of-mouth will get others to come check it out. This may find a second life when it eventually comes out on DVD/Blu-ray.",1443830400,4,2713,4.568788501026694
7351309,2,B012G7INVC,"The subversive rom-com writer/director Leslye Headland thought she had in Sleeping with Other People is buried in there somewhere, but it's been piled on by too many clich&eacute;s to be found. Headland's last film was the raunchy, delightfully nasty Bachelorette, a film that got by on the strength of its cast of brilliantly funny women. Headland again has put together a talented and very funny group, led by the charming pair of Alison Brie and Jason Sudeikis, but it only makes you angrier she's saddled them with an unfunny and surprisingly old-fashioned screenplay that barely measures up to the likes of No Strings Attached and Friends with Benefits.

If you know the aforementioned rom-coms then you have a pretty good idea of what Sleeping with Other People is tackling, namely the idea of men and women as friends without sexual attraction interfering. The commitment-phobes in this case are Lainey (Brie) and Jake (Sudeikis), who met one another in college as she was trying to lose her virginity to a boring guy living in his dorm. Lainey and Jake ended up having a one night stand, and neither really moved on past that encounter. Years later, she's still obsessed with the guy she didn't sleep with (now played by Adam Scott), and Jake is a serial womanizer who can't keep a relationship longer than a few months.

A chance encounter at a meeting for sex addicts (although Lainey isn't at all a sex addict, which is weird and never explained) brings Jake and Lainey back into one another's lives. The attraction, the instant connection between them is still there after all these years, but they decide instead to just be friends rather than screw everything up. Of course. Naturally, they become emotionally invested in one another; people who encounter them swear they are a married couple, but neither will admit to being in love with the other.

Cue up the jealousy when Lainey begins dating someone serious, and the...sort of casual acceptance of Jake's frequent sexual encounters. There's an undeniably sexist streak running through Headland's script, in which Lainey is portrayed as a total loser and cold fish who needs Jake's help just to learn how to masturbate properly. She literally chases around her old crush like a stalker, and then gives up her vow of abstinence to the first guy who says ""hello"" to her. Meanwhile, Jake is busy trying to woo the pants off his boss (Amanda Peet), and makes the reprehensible decision to insinuate himself into her life, becoming friends with her young son, under questionable circumstances. These are the people we're supposed to root for becoming a couple?

It's possible to tell a good story about people of questionable morals; Amy Schumer's Trainwreck is a fine, progressive example of how to do it. But there has to be a certain level of respect for the characters that Headland does not seem to have. She doesn't seem to know who she wants Jake or Lainey to be, or how we should feel about them. Should we laugh at them? The biggest laughs come from their long-married best friends, played by Jason Mantzoukas and Andrea Savage, who trade hilarious off-the-cuff barbs about the ugly side of being in love. If only we could have had a movie about them, instead, but at least they get the entire end credits to themselves. Brie and Sudeikis have real chemistry but it comes out in the scenes where Headland isn't desperately tossing them into ridiculous scenarios. Unfortunately, those times are few, and if this is what Sleeping with Other People is going to get us, perhaps it's a good idea to remain celibate.",1443484800,,3582,4.857610474631751
7351310,3,B012G7INVC,"Maybe the title gives some of the plot away, ya think?

If we have an irresistible force (a serial cheater) meet an immovable object (a womanizer), something's gotta give (Sorry, Johnny Mercer). Then after they develop a platonic friendship that lasts over the years through many failed relationships, do we even have to wonder what might happen? Nah...

This lightweight romance from the USA was featured at the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival. Written and directed by Leslye Headland (""Bachelorette"") this predictable bit of froth is engaging enough to enlist a top-tier cast willing to say all those anatomical terms that pass for dialogue in a romantic comedy these days. I know, I know, I sound like a stuffy old poop, but I really didn't need masturbation lessons demonstrated on an empty plastic beverage container. Based on scenes like this, I'm guessing this will be R-rated.

Featured are:
  * Alison Brie (""The Five-Year Engagement"") as Lainey. She's just a gal who can't SAY ""No."" Her worst weakness is that married doctor with whom she has had a relationship since college.
  * Jason Sudeikis (""Horrible Bosses 2"") Jake can't HEAR ""No."" As a result, he has earned quite the reputation as a successful lady's man.
  * Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") is Jake's nemesis: a loathsome classmate in college and the married agent of Lainey's misery.
  * Natasha Lyonne (""Orange is the New Black"") Kara is Lainey's wing man, full of advice and concern for Lainey.
  * Amanda Peet (""Identity Thief"") is Jake's confidant boss, casting admiring glances his way, until something slips.

I think you can see where this is going after we see our two lead characters meet in college and have a one-night stand, only to encounter one another again 15 years later. When they reconnect in a 12-step program for sexual issues, the story starts to gain a bit of traction.

I did NOT like the way the men consistently talked over the women, disregarding their opinions and their points of view; that felt too familiar. I DID like the performances, particularly Brie and Sudeikis; they made an appealing couple and we ended up rooting for them.

Only movie lovers with a high tolerance for sexual situations and anatomical language need apply.",1442188800,3,2247,4.952

7351627,5,B012G7INVC,"I was surprised by how much I liked this flick. So much that I had to watch it again the next night, because the first time I was only mildly paying attention. I went in because I love Alison Brie and I find Jason Sudeikis to be decent enough, and because I'm a sucker for indie rom-coms set in NYC.

As far as plot goes, it's pretty standard ""can man and woman just be friends"" rom-com fare, but manages to subvert a few of the more common tropes and is actually somewhat original. Sudeikis' acting is probably the best I've seen from him (I mean he's not going to win an Oscar for it, but he's in top form here), and Brie is lovely as usual. Director Leslye Headland also uses location well, with NYC almost playing the role of another character. Though it's mostly a very competently-shot film, there are also a few truly gorgeous shots in the movie. It's like the love-child between a big studio romantic comedy and an arthouse film.

What sealed the deal for me, though, was the chemistry between Sudeikis and Brie. They are absolutely phenomenal together, and sold the story even if sometimes the plot didn't. Dialogue is quick and witty, though often a bit raunchy. Not gross-out raunchy, but lots of f-words and sexual references, in case that bothers you.

Overall, I think it earns the 5 Stars. I tend to rate movies with the Roger Ebert school of thinking, judging the movies within the parameters of their expected audience and intended goals (i.e. a 5-star rom-com is not necessarily objectively as good as 5-star Lawrence of Arabia). If you're looking for a charming, funny movie, you will probably really enjoy Sleeping with Other People. If you're a fan of Sudeikis or Brie, I'm pretty sure you'll definitely enjoy this. I kind of see it as the best parts of a Judd Apatow rom-com mixed with the best parts of a Richard Curtis rom-com. It's a little bit raunchy and a little bit sweet, but in the end it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy about being in love.",1464220800,11,1974,4.5083798882681565
7351628,4,B012G7INVC,"So much better than I thought it would be. Sound like I'm offering faint praise? Nope. It's just that this movie, for whatever reason, got such little fanfare, and the reviews were back and forth. I thought Alison Brie and Jason Sudeikas were wonderful, with great chemistry. I thought I knew where things were going and then I didn't and then I did and then I didn't, and all because I was just sucked in and enjoying how things were going.

7351633,5,B012G7INVC,"Sleeping With Other People is quite a good movie, it could have had a better ending rather than following the standard rom com formula, but all American movies around a similar plot scenario (Friends With Benefits, The Proposal) made in recent years haven't managed to go against the grain so unfortunately we really don't expect any of them to anymore. The basic scenario of this one is the opposite of Friends With Benefits, we've got two strangers who hooked up one night in their university dorm, never saw each other again but have run into each other in an alcoholic anonymous type meeting for people who sleep around too much which damages their relationship with their partner. These two decide to hang out but commit not to have a relationship or sleep together. They even have a mousetrap safety word if the other is turning the other on. This is where I think it's lazy and disappointing we went with the formulaic rom com outcome.

From the DVD cover images I didn't realise the main female character was Alison Brie (best known as Annie from Community). She is nothing like that character in this one, even physically looking, most of the time you're not reminded at all of Annie. She does a great job and is extremely likeable in this one, hopefully she'll get cast in more movies. Jason Sudeikis isn't as big a stretch from his most well known roles (We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses and others), but that character actually works well in this movie.

This is a fun movie, it is more of a rom com than a comedy, but it still has plenty of light moments, and a few laughs too. I rate this four and a half stars.",1461369600,,1627,4.549488054607509

7351797,3,B012G7INVC,"Possible spoiler.  Director and writer Leslye Headland (Bachelorette) isn't breaking new ground here with films like When Harry Met Sally, to look back on.  The story deals with a man and a woman becoming friends but leaving sex out of the equation.  More common these days are films like Friends with Benefits and No Strings Attached where the couple have casual sex but leave romance and love out of it.

Alison Brie (The Kings of Summer) and Jason Sudeikis (Horrible Bosses) get a chance to headline a movie for a change and do a commendable job in this romantic comedy.  Their characters Lainey and Jake meet in a coed college dorm where Lainey is to hook up with her boyfriend Matthew (Adam Scott) who is ignoring her pleas to open the door and let her in.  The pair go to the roof  to talk and it comes out that both are virgins.  Or they were until that night.  They go their separate ways until they run into each other in New York, 12 years later.  It turns out neither has been successful at love.

Lainey still moons over Matthew who is now a gynecologist, but also has a regular boyfriend (Adam Brody).  Jake has several woman he sees but has never fallen for anyone.  They run into each other again at one of the 12 Step sex addiction meetings.  They go out, have a good time, but agree to forego sex to keep their friendship intact.  Lainey has a brief affair with a divorced dad (Marc Blucas) and Jake has a clandestine relationship with his boss (Amanda Peet).  But both keep thinking about each other.

The film moves along nicely for the first two thirds and then devolves into stupidity. While having lunch with Paula (Peet), Jake sees Matthew having lunch with his very pregnant wife (Katherine Waterston).  He walks over and sucker punches him in the restaurant.  Why? The final act just seemed to be strung together on the fly and not well thought out.  You'll have to guess if they Jake and Lainey get back together.  The movie is an enjoyable but routine R rated romcom.  The R is for language and fully clothed sex.",1454976000,,2040,4.501362397820164

I always loved Jason Sudeikis but never found him charming or in a romantic setting of a movie and he really becomes a leading man in this movie.  Alison Brie is also as sweet and charming and makes you really fall in love with them together. Doesn't become as predictable as you would expect, it may be predictable of what you expect to happen overall but the content is different, funny and makes you wonder if what you expect to happen is going to really happen because of all the twists and turns it brings you to.  You root for them, you'll want them to be one but you won't expect their story to go down the way it does. The jokes are funny, and the storyline is funny.  Usually movies are such crude jokes that it just seems that they are trying to be funny and it is just annoying.  This is definitely different,  and makes you wish there was a series with these characters.",1454457600,,1033,4.244897959183674

It's sweet, in a very self destructive sort of way. The two main characters are both emotional disasters who need each other to right their lives.

The acting was stellar by most of the cast. Allison Brie does an amazing job of playing a woman denying she's attracted to a man and denying she's in love with a man. Amanda Peet nails the role of a single mom who's distant but lets her guard down. Adam Scott transforms himself it's a completely creepy douche. Jason Sudeikis is funny, but is the weak spot in the dramatic acting of the film. He's got one scene where he almost emotes, but just doesn't connect.

Still, it's a sweet story. It's worth a single watch. It's a good rental, probably not worth buying.",1454112000,2,775,4.4822695035460995

7351953,5,B012G7INVC,This movie was great! Kinda reminded me of my dating years and relationship with my best guy friends. The movie has a ranchers humor and it's not the average bulls*** relationship movie. Great twist on dating and the only bad reviews I'm sure will come from the conservative population. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone!,1452297600,4,341,4.796610169491525
7351954,1,B012G7INVC,"Trite, not funny. Every character is a jerk and trying too hard. We turned it off not even halfway through, and we only watched that much because we had paid for it. I wouldn't even watch this thing if it were free.",1452211200,6,215,4.142857142857143

7351961,2,B012G7INVC,"Awful Movie.  Was so bad we quit watching bout 1/3 of the way in as just couldn't take it any longer.  The premise of the movie sounded cute but it simply did not come together.  Watching the male lead character show the female lead character how she could pleasure herself, and using a empty Gatorade bottle to give her an example, was yucky.  My BF and I had enough at that point and turned this tortureous film off.
Loved Jason Sudeikis in ""Vacation"".... but this movie missed the mark on being entertaining and the sexual humor attempted just wasn't funny and came out somewhat crude.",1451692800,2,588,4.571428571428571
7351962,2,B012G7INVC,Could not get into it. Was lame from the beginning. A very juvenile movie. Finally gave up and stopped watching well before the end. How can I get a refund???  Only gave it 2 Stars for the effort.,1451520000,,196,4.157894736842105
7351963,5,B012G7INVC,This movie was a real treat.  I expected it to be the typical raunchy movie with lame jokes but it actually had substance.  The story line was creative and unexpected and the characters were incredibly likable.,1451520000,2,210,4.805555555555555

7351965,2,B012G7INVC,"Formulaic despite itself.  The film tries hard to be funny, and sometimes succeeds (and often doesn't -- it's forced) but doesn't try to hard to be genuine, and it is hard to care about these thin characters who don't seem particularly invested in their own lives.  These are supposed to be people whose choices have left them damaged, but they don't seem like people at all, just a pretext for another iteration of the cute-meet.  It could have been interesting, but ultimately makes a lame attempt to be  superficially offensive but only manages to be extremely predictable.",1451260800,,576,4.907216494845361
7351966,1,B012G7INVC,"Awful. I was so bugged throughout this lame movie that I felt quite angry I lost 2 hours of my life. The writing was so sophomoric and juvenile, and apparently bigger names passed on this stupid script so the producers settled on two so-so, b-list actors who were more than happy to get a chance to be leads in a feature film regardless of how awful it was. Neither actors are lead material and they had no chemistry. Who wrote this? A male virgin in the basement of his mom's house?? There was nothing here remotely true about women or their orgasms, but somehow that scene where he's demonstrating with a bottle how to make her climax was SO STUPID and inaccurate, yet we were to believe that A.) this guy knew more about her body than she did, and B.) she found his drawn out demonstration hot??? Their relationship was so dumb and I didn't laugh once throughout this entire ""comedy"". Bleck!",1451174400,2,894,4.49079754601227

8726150,4,B012G7INVC,Very original rom-com. The premise is that the main characters have unhealthy relationships: he is a sex addict; she is probably a love addict. It has a great message and seems a bit less fanciful than the average rom com (despite the unnecessary plot points where he strikes it rich and she decides to go to medical school despite seeming perfectly happy as an elementary school teacher). The supporting characters were interesting and the setting was beautiful (lots of good Upper West Side and Central Park scenes).,1524355200,,518,4.9655172413793105
8726151,3,B012G7INVC,"Another ""romantic comedy"" ruined by sex and trying to act like that is modern and hip. This movie starts promising. Lainey causes a scene in a dorm where Jake is staying and he volunteers to say she is with him to keep her from being thrown out. After talking for a while they both realize they are virgins and lose their virginity together. Fast forward years later and both are.... having issues with sex and relationships. Jake is a sex addict; Lainey is having a hard time giving up her current partner / lover who is HORRIBLE to her.  They meet in a sex addiction class and decide to become just friends.  Of course that is impossible -- the movie does remind me of When Harry Met Sally. But the entire time these two talk with each other they are having various sexual relationships with others.  Of course, in the end Jake declares his love but, after all that... how could anyone really believe it? Love? Or do you just need your next fix. Jason Sueikis deploys a particularly annoying style here where he is talking fast all the time.  Droning, if you will, like he is manic. But the real problem is several unlikable characters and emphasis on sex.",1522713600,,1158,4.5
8726152,1,B012G7INVC,What a dull stupid movie.  The predictability didn't matter but the continuous drone of Jason Sudeikis and pathetic plot was close to unbearable.,1522281600,,145,5.304347826086956
