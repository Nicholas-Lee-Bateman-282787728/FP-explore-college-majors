8367626,2,B001XJBCY0,"BACKGROUND:  I am interested in learning Chinese brush painting and as a foundation for that I was looking for a video to provide training in basic standard (Kai Shu) Chinese calligraphy brush strokes, etc. so I purchased this video hoping for that.
Unfortunately, this program is *not* a training program.  It features a series of short ""lessons"" in which the host paints a few (1-3 characters) in a given style but does not teach foundational technique -- brush handling and brush strokes.  The host is obviously a well-trained calligrapher and is more than capable of teaching the basics -- I wish she would do so in a future DVD.
CONTENT:  Introduction to Chinese Calligraphy (2DVDs) presented by host Ms. Li Zhengyan
