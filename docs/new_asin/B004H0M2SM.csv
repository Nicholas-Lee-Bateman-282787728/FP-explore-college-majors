8429175,5,B004H0M2SM,This is a great collection full of classic late 1920s-1938 live musical and action shorts. It features 2 disc of color films which are my favorite and most discs are very enjoyable to watch. The downside is the price.. This DVD should be around $25-$30. These films have been restored and sound great. I hope WARNER BROS continues to release these films.,1498089600,,354,4.725806451612903

8429177,3,B004H0M2SM,"The title ""Vitaphone Cavalcade of Musical Comedy"" is really a misnomer! This 6-disc set has very few of what I would call MUSICAL comedies... Most of it is actually early Vitaphone shorts - some of them taken from early silent footage (albeit with a musical background from the Vitaphone studios) and a few are not even comedies! The title should have been ""Early Vitaphone Shorts, Volume 1""... Nonetheless, I found it enjoyable, and - yes - I'm hoping they will release more of them!",1306195200,22,484,4.773809523809524
8429178,3,B004H0M2SM,"Hello,

  First of all, the quality of the picture and sound of these short films is astonishing.  Most of these look like they were filmed yesterday.

  I am almost finished playing through these DVDs for the first time.  The first two discs are mostly very interesting, especially the shorts which don't only consist of an orchestra from the early 1930's standing in front of the camera and simply playing.  These quickly get boring.

  I also enjoyed disc 4, and really found disc 5 and 6 enjoyable with their very vivid Technicolor footage.  Of course most of the discs are really very silly indeed, but if you just go with it, they are a lot of fun.

  Then we arrive at disc 3.  This consists of a series of short after short, which show clips of various early silent films with an extremely mocking commentary.  After the first one, I found the disc almost unwatchable and would certainly never play it again.  People who buy this set love the history of Hollywood, and really don't want it mocked.  Is it possible that the value of the disc is that it sometimes shows films which no longer exist and this is the only way to see at least a fragment of them?

  My last and chief objection is the almost complete lack of documentation.  This set cries out for some sort of booklet to go with it.  I had to surf the net to even get the dates when the shorts were filmed.  Thank goodness for ""The Vitaphone Project"".

  I am not sorry I bought the set.  It will sit in my collection next to ""The Jazz Singer"" collection, but beware of the above comments.  Even the internet has very little information to supplement these shorts.",1301616000,54,1633,4.4523809523809526
8429179,5,B004H0M2SM,"Fantastic collection of Vitaphone shorts from Warner Archives. The Technicolor examples are quite stunning though the subject matter varies in quality. There is something for everyone in this collection. B&W shorts ""Nine O'Clock Folks"" and ""Surprise"" with rarely seen  Vaudeville headliners the Duncan Sisters I also enjoyed very much. The restoration and reproduction quality of both picture and sound is generally excellent for such old and neglected films.",1301097600,28,459,5.75
