8154112,3,B000K2USVO,Its ok but not great,1426464000,,20,3.2
8154113,2,B000K2USVO,I found I already knew all this dvd had to teach. Ihold a USBC level 1 coaching badge certificate and my game could use improvement so I bought it.,1411344000,,147,4.103448275862069
8154114,1,B000K2USVO,"This was a total waste of money.  It went through bowlers who didn't have anything in common with my style or problem.  For the most part it only discussed straightening one's ball out for spares from 125 up through 200+ average bowlers.  I am so shocked that this is all Walter Ray could produce considering that he is one of the most acurate bowlers on the tour.  Showed nothing on release, correcting turning early, release point, grip, etc.; real problems of real bowlers...  I watched this DVD once and shredded it.  Total waste of time waiting and my money.  I don't mean to be harsh; I'm just being honest.  I'm only one spare or strike away from averaging 200 and trying to work on my consistency and I couldn't get a thing from this DVD.

Hands down, I'd refer anyone to Norm Duke's video.  Watched it and went to the bowling alley and incorporated his corrective techniques instantly.  My average is sure to go up soon...",1324771200,,931,4.548192771084337
8154115,3,B000K2USVO,"The DVD has a few good pointers but not enough to keep you feeling satisfied. Some of the pointers were helpful yet redundant. There was not enough variety. However on a positive note, Walter Ray and Mark were decent with their coaching.

I only recommend this to bowlers who are just starting and are looking for some guidance on the basic funadamentals that they may be lacking. If you're hoping to learn about how to position yourself according to the lane conidtions, converting spares, how to release the ball properly, this is not the DVD for you.",1187568000,3,553,4.701030927835052
8154116,3,B000K2USVO,"I could not find a system in the way this DVD was built up.

They show all kinds of people with different averages (125-220) they watch them bowl, they give them advices then they watch them again. Most of them are doing the same thing after what they did before. I'm a beginner so it may be me but I would expect more for 30 bucks.",1175126400,4,332,4.03030303030303
8154117,4,B000K2USVO,I learned many things from this DVD. I am a beginner in bowling and average 120 but after seeing this DVD I got a 172 game. Many of the things shown; are in books; but it helps to see it in action. All the DVD's in bowling are a bit expensive but I feel it helped my game.,1173830400,,272,3.706896551724138
