2828345,5,B000PUBA7M,"I never thought I'd see the day when my son would sleep through the night. After over a year of struggling with him every night, all of us completely sleep deprived, this CD changed our lives within an hour. It's great for exhausted parents who find that reading puts them to sleep, and it's a wonderful way for both parents to learn at the same time. We now have a child who sleeps through the night and it's changed our family life for the better!  Thank you for this miraculous program and easy to follow CD.",1182816000,3,511,4.322916666666667
2828346,5,B000PUBA7M,"This DVD was exactly what I needed - My husband & I were so sleep deprived and were desparate for an answer, but didn't know what to do.  After less than one hour, this video gave us the confidence to adopt the sleep easy approach to sleep training and our baby girl was sleeping through the night in 3 days.

It was a great way to bring my husband into the process - I could have never got him to read a book.  It was a great way for us to get the advice and confidence to know our baby was ready to sleep through.",1182729600,6,515,3.8857142857142857

2828348,5,B000PUBA7M,"We are so grateful for this program. Like many other moms whose babies have not slept through the night, I felt quite uncertain the program would be effective in just a few days for my six month old. Our baby has slept not just WITH myself or my husband, but actually in our arms, for most of the night of every night since birth. Because of his reflux, he was uncomfortable sleeping flat and needed an alternative. After we discovered the Fisher Price glider, he was able to sleep a few hours in there, then, upon waking for his first feeding, I would take him to bed and sleep sitting up with a special pillow, the baby in my arms. Incredibly, this program worked from day 1. The first night was actually the easiest for us, as, after 13 minutes of crying, he slept mostly straight through the night, by himself, in our co-sleeper.

We do have one point with which we are still wrestling, which is fairly unique and which we have not seen addressed in the materials.  Our baby has always been very uncomfortable in wet diapers and still wakes usually twice a night crying for a diaper change, and then cries and gestures for milk. We change him and I give him a mini-feeding, though he is virtually weaned.

Overall, we are so grateful for all this program has brought to our lives. We sleep infinitely better at night, and rising for a few minutes twice a night is nothing compared to six months of waking ever couple of hours and not knowing when we would return to sleep. Day time is much easier as well, as our son has not only taken well to having three naps, he tends to now automatically begin falling asleep at those times.

Regain your sanity, re-strengthen your relationships, and observe with joy your rested child!",1182556800,21,1728,4.476190476190476
2828349,5,B000PUBA7M,"This DVD really helped us get our 4 month old son to sleep well during the night, and take naps in his crib during the day.  I had purchased and read several books on sleep before the Sleepeasy Solution was recommended to me.  I couldn't bear to spend any more time reading another book on sleep, being exhausted myself, so I opted for the DVD.  It was concise, clear and well organized.  Jill and Jennifer lay out everything for a tired parent so that there is no guess-work - we simply followed their system and within a few nights our son was sleeping much better.  Plus, the DVD was easy for my husband, the nanny, and grandparents to watch and follow along with.  I can't recommend this product enough.  Plus, it comes with a small pamphlet the lays out the basic steps, so, if you can't remember one of the steps, you don't have to replay the DVD, just refer to the pamphlet.",1181088000,15,881,4.368098159509202

Now that she is ready (a year later) she has done very well with this. I also shared this with some friends who did this as soon as they could with their little ones and they said by the 3rd night it was a complete success. I was not so lucky, but I also selected to allow my daughter to choose a time that was right for her, not for us, but when she was ready we experienced extremely quick results by the 3rd day as well.",1453334400,5,561,4.017857142857143

Between the 2nd and 3rd check in, our almost 11 month old daughter was so upset she vomited everywhere. I ended up coming in and turning the light on. I picked her up and was consoling her for a good 15 minutes before she was finally calmed down. I can't see putting her through this ""cry it out"" again. We wanted this to work so we could wean her from co-sleeping, but I'm not so sure that this is for every child.",1423785600,2,538,4.1826923076923075

We had tried ""save our sleep"" religiously since he was 6 weeks and it just didn't work. I HATE reading, (plus I wasn't willing to sacrifice sleeping time for reading time) and I just wanted something quick, to the point and something I didn't have to try and re-explain to my husband. We watched the dvd while having dinner one night and our little boy responded perfectly at every step and he is now sleeping through the night.

When my baby stopped napping effectively, (he always slept through the night fine) I watched this DVD. In 4 days he was back to napping 2-3 times a day and barely cried when I put him in his bed! He puts himself to sleep every time! He is happier, laughs and plays more, and his early evening ""cranky"" period that we had become accustomed to has almost disappeared entirely! This DVD shows real parents and babies/toddlers going through the sleep training process. It is so SIMPLE and realistic. It answered every question you could have, and addresses every different scenario possible. This will be my go-to gift for every new mother!!",1407974400,2,743,4.552238805970149
2828360,5,B000PUBA7M,"We used this program on our 9-month-old son and it eventually worked. I say ""eventually"" because it takes longer than the 72 hours advertised on the book and DVD, at least for our baby. The approach is actually very soft and loving, as opposed to the Sleep Lady Solution which advises staying in the room with your crying baby and gradually inching your way out of the room, until you're in the hall, all while whispering, ""Go to sleep."" That didn't work for us, it just made our son more mad to see us and us not picking him up.

The Sleep Easy Solution is different, it has you pop into the room in 5 minutes, 10 minutes, then every 15. You're only in there for 30 seconds or so and you don't touch your baby. You just gently wish him a good night, say I love you, and leave. No lingering. The DVD is very well organized and easy to understand. My husband and I felt such a sense if relief just watching it! We were confident this would work.

Well our son wasn't so thrilled. I believe he cried harder and longer, in protest to us not picking him up. He was punishing us for having him CIO, which this program is basically a softer CIO method. I liked that we could go in and leave, not sit there and watch him cry. At least for us, this took about two weeks to really work, and even now, four months into it, he still fusses and cries, however at this point all we need to do is a 5 and 10.

Today he sleeps about 12 hours straight and we've all hugely benefitted from doing this. We are rested and happy and ready for the day ahead. I'm so grateful I got this DVD and would recommend it to every parent. But be patient, it takes a while. Your baby WILL get it, and once they do it's awesome. :)",1403913600,3,1699,4.11144578313253
2828361,1,B000PUBA7M,"Waste of money and time. This is common sense information. Read Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Weissbluth instead. His suggestions are developmentally appropriate and you can read about sleep information for newborns and up. I am highly dissatisfied with this product.....COMMON SENSE should be the title!",1400803200,4,311,5.638297872340425
2828362,5,B000PUBA7M,"Even though I truly believe that the Sleepeasy Solution is the best thing for my baby, hearing him cry breaks my heart.  The free White Noise Baby ap has really helped.  When my baby is fussing/crying, I turn the White Noise Baby ap on and put 5, 10, or 15 minutes on the ap's timer.  The white noise drowns out the crying so I don't melt into a crying mess and rush in to hold him.  I can even go back to sleep sometimes.  When the timer is up, the white noise sound goes off and I wake up if my baby is still crying.  If he's asleep, I don't wake up.

I got the Sleepeasy Solution DVD when my baby was 4 months old.  I was hoping for a way to get him to sleep through the night - he was getting up 4 times a night to eat and my husband and I were tired and desperate.  The author recommends waiting until a baby is 5 months old to start working on sleeping through the night because at that age their stomachs are larger.  I was really bummed, but decided to follow their advice.  I was still able to implement several of their techniques right away to help with putting him down for bedtime because we had trouble with that, too.  According to the DVD, he cried when I put him down to sleep because he was too tired due to lack of naps during the day and too late of a bedtime.  So I asked the babysitter to make sure he got 3 hours of sleep during the day (2-3 naps) and his bedtime was moved up to 8:00 pm since we want him to get up at 7:00 a.m.  He cried for 52 minutes the first night when I put him to bed, it broke my heart, but I stayed strong.  Every night after that, all I had to do was lay him down and walk away and he goes to sleep. He was instantly a happier baby and I was a less frazzled mommy, so that alone made the DVD worth it.  It also laid the groundwork for the sleeping through the night techniques.

I then began counting down the days until he was finally 5 months old.  I'm glad I waited until he was 5 months because the week before he turned 5 months old he began drinking a lot more milk at each feeding during the day, although he was still waking up 4 times a night to eat.  So I guess his stomach did get a lot bigger at that age.  At night, he would eat 1-2 oz at 12:00, 6 oz at 1:30, then 1-2 oz around 3 and 4:30.  I am currently four days into the plan to get him to sleep through the night and its working even better than I thought it would. Not only am I functioning a lot better during the day, he's an even happier baby, I think it's due to him sleeping for longer stretches of time.

There are several minor finesse type steps that are important that the DVD goes into, so don't please don't try to follow what I describe without watching the DVD!  Basically, once he was 5 months old, I ignored all feedings that were 2 oz or less.  I wake him up and feed him 30 minutes before any feeding that was greater than 2 oz (I wake him up at 1:00) so that he no longer associates crying in the middle of the night with getting fed.  I also reduce the feeding by 1 oz per day until he is down to less than 2 oz, at which point I won't wake him up at all and I do a happy dance.  Except I won't really do a happy dance because I will be sleeping!  Whoohoo!

1st night - he cried once for around 40 minutes, I checked on him at the 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min mark like the DVD says to do and he drank 6 oz at 1:00.
2nd night - He didn't cry at all and got 5 oz at 1:00.
3rd night - He cried twice for about 20 minutes each time, I checked on him at the 5 min and 15 min mark each time, he drank 4 oz at 1:00, he was awake but not crying when I went to feed him (I think the crying was because he didn't get his naps that day and got to bed late so he was over tired).
4th night - no fussing/crying and he drank 3 oz when I woke him up at 1:00.
5th night - I woke him up and fed him 2 oz at 1:00. He woke up fussing at 4:30, I was worried he hadn't eaten much that evening before bed and was still hungry so I breast fed him, he nursed quite a while so I think that was the right thing to do.
6th night - He woke up fussing at 4:30, I was again worried he didn't eat much during the day so I fed him, but he only ate 1 oz, and wanted to play!  Guess I should have ignored that one.
7th night - He work up 3 times between 3 and 5 a.m., fussed/cried for less than 5 minutes each time and went back to sleep.  Ate his customary  1-2 oz for breakfast, so I don't think he woke up from hunger, I think I made the right call by not getting up when he fussed/cried.

Update - My son is now 9 months old.  He is easy to put down to bed (I lay him down, he goes to sleep, no cry, no fuss, easy as that).  It is rare that he gets up in the middle of the night, when he does wake up it is because he's not feeling well etc.  I recommend the Sleep Easy Solution to all the moms I know, along with Freemie Cups, and the Fischer Price Rock n' Play Sleeper.",1399507200,2,4878,3.7630285152409044

At that point we had to rock her to sleep on our shoulder and then place her in crib asleep. If she woke up, we'd have to start all over again. A friend recommended this DVD and our daughter responded to it so quickly and effectively. I didn't think it would work, even as I was watching it. But she improved each night we tried and after a week, we were able to lay her in the crib while she was completely awake and she put herself to sleep.

I did not want to do any sort of ""cry it out"" with my baby, and having read the description I thought that this book doesn't involve any crying.  It's not pure cio...they use a ""graduated"" method where you let them cry for 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, etc.  Not a fit for",1378425600,3,543,4.326732673267327

2828368,5,B000PUBA7M,"I was unsure that this would work, but after a referal from a patient of mine, I tried it.  My son was 13 months old and had rarely ever slept through the night.  I thought I had a consistant routine for his bed time and that I had tried everything but he didn't sleep.
It took 13 nights for us for the change to take place.  However, I misunderstood one key point. I was checking on him as soon as he would wake up at night instead of waiting the 5 min first.  After rewatching the video at night 9, it took 4 more nights until he was sleeping through.
Its been three weeks of wonderful sleep for our household now.  I really wish I had tried this when he was 5 months old.  We all would have been better rested and I would have felt like a better more alert mommy.
I think this system is amazing! He even tells us when he's tired now.  He will close the book and point to his bed.  There are no tears for bed time and his confidence in himself has increased.

2828371,5,B000PUBA7M,"So my husband and I had been cosleeping with my 13 month old since he hit the 9 month sleep regression and also had a massive teething session where four teeth popped in almost all at once.  We were very nervous about any form of CIO and I was actually completely against it since my son's birth but the lack of good sleep from my son tossing around most nights had us desperate after 4 months and we knew we had to make a change.

Upon the recommendation of this book from a good friend and reading all the wonderful amazon reviews we decided to give it a go.  I went to my parents house on the first night of training and my husband went for it following the program step by step. I couldn't stay as I knew I would be a wreck and my husband agreed that it would be hard enough emotionally on him without me crying next to him plus my son has major separation anxiety from me right now so it would prolong the crying if I was involved.  (ladies if your husbands can do e training have them do it, it takes such a load off)

So on the first night my son cried for 13 minutes straight and then stopped, proceeded to walk around is crib trying to propel himself out for the next 1.5 hrs with intermittent crying here and there and my husband followed the check in advice in the book although he has to improv a bit since my son never cried for 5 minutes straight after the first 13 minutes but he still wanted him to know he was there.  Then my son crashed probably from exhaustion and slept through the night for 9 hrs.  BAM that was it, training done after just one night!  We are on night 7 and he has put himself to sleep every night with a minute or two of on and off crying and we have never had to check in at all and he sleeps 11.5 to 12 hours all night!!  It's like we are a new family and we are all relaxed and thrilled. I have even put him to bed myself and the results are the same even with the separation anxiety. We know this is the new normal for our family!

 I'm typing this review from my bed at 8:30 where I plan to unwind to my favorite tv shows and get a full night of sleep!

We are so thankful to this program and could not recommend it enough!!

2828376,5,B000PUBA7M,"I bought the paperback and the Kindle edition, too (I'll be posting glowing reviews in those categories soon).  The purpose of buying the DVD was to share the information with my mom and mother-in-law who care for our 9-month old while wifey and I work.  Turns out that watching the DVD in addition to reading the book, really made a HUGE difference in the execution of sleep training.

Let me back up a bit... I work part-time teaching preschool gymnastics.  I'm also a part-time stay-at-home-dad and I had been in charge of putting our daughter down to sleep at night.  She was an incredible sleeper until the age of 7-months.  We (I really should say ""I"") ended up developing all sorts of bad habits concerning bedtime.  Every night it was this crazy ritual including taking her into the bathroom with the shower running, humming, rocking her in my arms, rocking her in her glider chair.. all in hopes of getting her to finally fall asleep.  If she wasn't completely asleep, she'd start to cry again and it would be back to square one.  Often this would take over an hour in total, and then she'd also often awake and require more of the same to get back to sleep.  I was a zombie for those two months, until a mom at my gym told me about the Sleepeasy Solution.  My wife and I had read Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child, but were a little uneasy with the prescribed methods of that book.  The authors of Sleepeasy Solution offered a more gentle transition.

Still, I was nervous.  Nobody wants to hear their baby cry, especially for 5, 10, or 15 minute stretches!  We followed the instructions of the book to the letter.  The DVD arrived the day before we started the sleep training.  We decided to watch it just to get psyched up and to watch the actual sleep-training in action that the authors do with four real families.  I swear to you, I thought I knew everything about the method, but the DVD helped clarify the process so much better.  I'm glad I had both.  We were almost about to call the people at Sleepy Planet (the authors' company) to pay for 1-on-1 phone consultation (like I said, I was REALLY nervous).  The DVD clarified everything without the need of an expensive call.

How did it go?  First night, she took two check-ins and fell asleep after 21 minutes (the authors suggest it may take as long as an hour).  The second night, she fell asleep in 3.5 minutes and every night since then as been between 0-2 minutes before she's out.  The last two nights (we're seven days into it now) she has gone to sleep in her crib, put down awake but drowsy, with not a peep of protest!!

Naps are going amazing, too!  She gets in her crib and maybe cries for a total of 1 minute.  She's fallen right in line with the schedule they recommend for kids her age.  She's also happier, more energetic, and I'm getting better sleep now, too!

I cannot recommend their products enough.  At least buy the book and DVD if you're desperate for relief.  It's a lot less scary than you might think!",1354147200,10,2997,4.462246777163904
2828377,5,B000PUBA7M,"I've never written a review for Amazon before, but this sleep method was life-transforming for us and I wanted to share it with other parents.  People, it works!
I bought the book and the DVD.  The great thing about the DVD is that if you are in need of a sleep program in the first place, you are probably too tired to read a book!  The DVD covers the same things as the book, but you can watch it as a couple and be on the same page instantly.  The authors appear in the DVD and they can come off as overly-sincere, but ignore that and take their advice.  Within 4 nights, my 5 month old son was night-weaned and sleeping 10-12 hours a night plus two naps.  I have loaned this DVD to three other girlfriends.  Two of them chose to follow it and they have thanked me ever since.  Yes, this is a cry it out method, but you go in the baby's room every 5-15 minutes to reassure them until the crying stops.  My son is now 2 1/2 and continues to be a great sleeper because he's used to falling asleep without me after we do his routine.",1353024000,,1033,4.074257425742574
2828378,1,B000PUBA7M,"I bought this DVD for my one year old son after I read somewhere that it was an ""in between"" method, meaning it wasn't 100% CIO (Cry It Out). I am not sure what they meant by ""in between"" because this basically tells you to let your child cry for however long it takes. I tried this one night and it was TERRIBLE. They tell you not to touch the child as it will basically tease them, making them think you are going to pick them up and then you don't....My question is, if you don't touch your baby, how do you know if they aren't burning from a fever? Freezing cold? What if they spit up/threw up in their crib? Have a dirty diaper? Are you just supposed to rely on the smell of feces or vomit to tell you???

I'm sorry, but I will just stick to getting my child sleepy and laying him down in his crib, and sitting beside it, still letting him learn how to go to sleep on his own. But when he has a nightmare or is sick and needs his Mommy, I'm going to choose to be there for him. I can sleep when he goes to college, but for now, I'm 100% Mom.",1338508800,11,1046,3.9339622641509435
2828379,5,B000PUBA7M,"This DVD is great as an 'Intro to sleep training'.  If your spouse is not an avid reader, this is great to have just so that they have some idea of what is going on when you try getting your baby on a sleep schedule.  Then, one of you can be the expert and actually read the book.  If you want to be even more knowledgeable, I would also recommend either buying or checking out ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" from your local library.

One other tip: if you have an iPhone/iPad, get the app called ""Baby Log"".  The book recommends keeping a log on the baby's sleep patterns, and this app makes everything so much easier.  The app can also help you keep track of sleep, feedings, diaper changes, etc.",1334534400,2,703,4.32824427480916
2828380,1,B000PUBA7M,"This makes me feel so sad. Just terrible to see people acting as if this is a natural way to rear a child.

This video is not good at all. Please stay away from it unless you want to use the cry it out method. (yikes if you do.)

First of all, another cry it out method? Uhck. Nothing new, just copied. Cry it out methods are not good. I often wonder if cry it out methods are so popular only because they justify a parents need to detach and/or laziness!

Second of all, if you were to compare this method to other books on sleep and babies in general (written by pediatricians that is) you will find how totally wrong it is. Please read more by authors such as Karp and Sears before you blindly follow these women. There is no quick fix that doesn't comprise adequate parenting which is a 24 hour job.

Third, this DVD does not address diaper changes, teething, growth spurts and other underlying factors that come and go as babies grow and develop that WILL affect sleep patterns. Apparently your baby is supposed to lay in a wet or soiled diaper all night so you ""don't need to touch him"" thus militantly train his/her early staged cognitive mind to ""self-soothe"" in reality you're forcing the child to emotionally and physically exhaust itself under unnatural duress all because you can't step up. That's the crux of this method's success. People who rely on sleep charts and callous uneducated detachment in the end care less about the child's well being and more about bending the child to their will. In the simplest terms this is, horrific.

This product isn't absolutely worthless. LOL. It made me realize exactly how I DON'T want to be as a parent.",1331769600,12,1659,4.516666666666667

I was having panic attacks and my husband and I had NO patience left at all.  We got this video, and here's how it went:  on night one, he cried and hour and a half.  On night 2, he woke up and cried for 10 minutes but slept the rest of the night.  On night 3, he slept through the night!!!

We just finished the 4th night (and 3rd day of naps) of following the process. The 1st night was tough but not as bad as I thought it would be.  He cried for 30 minutes, fell asleep, then woke up after 30 min and cried again for about 20 min.  He woke up about 5 times throughout the night but every time he went back to sleep on his own in about 5-10 min each time.  We also followed the weaning process described in the book (and DVD- we bought both).  I wasn't convinced it would work - but it did.  We finished the weaning process in 3 nights and then the 4th night he slept 11 hours straight!",1311033600,,827,3.9518072289156625
2828383,4,B000PUBA7M,"If you want to sleep train your baby, no method avoids crying all together.  So us parents have to face reality and just grit an bear it.  Even the most humane method results in some crying from the baby.  Unless you want to co-sleep and rock until the baby is ready to move on (which can be years) then sleep training is a must and some crying is unavoidable.

I like the step by step instructions given in the DVD.  It's easy to watch and saves time (over reading tons of books).  I did read one other one.  The no cry sleep solution.... which teaches you to tailor your sleep training methods to your own style. This is great also, but can take longer to work.  For us, I was seriously hitting a wall and I wanted results fast with minimal crying.... Sleep easy worked for us.

It was a process though depending on how old your child is when you start.  Mine was 4 months old so we just worked on the part about getting him sleep.  It only took 4 days for him learn to put himself to sleep.  Granted the first day was excruciating but we didn't have a choice.  We had rocked him to sleep 4 times in a row that night and he just wouldn't allow us to put him down, screaming every time. We tried 3 hours and were besides ourselves.  Good thing I had already watched the DVD and we started sleep training that same night.

I had my doubts at first because my son had very serious eczema, scratches his face at night, was used to being rocked to sleep and then being placed in a swing to sleep in.....and he was still being swaddled. We cut it all out at once.  I figure if it's going to be work for him it's only fair to work on it all at once instead of one at a time which would be unfair to him by making him adjust to new things again and again and again.  The first night was excrutiating.  He cried for 45 min (I almost clawed my eyes out, thank goodness for my husband) He woke 2 times during the night to feed (as we weren't night weaning yet).  The next night was 20 min.  The third night was 10 min to put himself to sleep.  The 4th night also took 10 min but without the crying!  It was great.  In the end he didn't end up scratching himself bloody because we were able to get the eczema under control at about the same time.  You must get the eczema under control or the babies will scratch, bleed and get infected.  Cut the nails extremely short and blunted, put a layer of vaseline everywhere and never let them be without a layer of grease, hydrocrotisone is also a must.

Anyway, back to sleep training, I still had to get up at least 2x/night to nurse because he wasn't old enough or heavy enough to night wean yet.  We didn't night wean until he was well over the limit because I still didn't want to give up those sweet moments.  Anyway, in the end Night-Weaning took another week.  He is now 6 1/2 months old and doesn't fuss at bedtime.  Our routine is so ingrained in him that no matter where we are at 6:30pm he gets fussy and wants his bath.  At 7-7:30pm he's tired and wants to sleep.  He wakes up at night but puts himself back to sleep within 15 min.

Nap time took longer to figure out, I'd say 1 month to get it all ironed out, but it's pretty good now.

My advice:  This is a very effective method but only if you're ready for it.  You have to want it bad enough to sit through the crying (and there will be crying)  You have to be tough enough on yourself not to deviate from the advice given in this DVD.  Otherwise you may not be ready for sleep training at all (no matter what method you choose)",1305158400,,3529,4.112737920937042

Also at night she was waking 2 to 6 times.  In just 3 days she is now sleeping through the night and self settling to sleep during the day in less than 10minutes!  I still can't quite believe it has worked so well.  Baby Jade also seems happier and more relaxed when she is awake. Thankyou so much!!!!!,1300838400,2,564,4.185185185185185
2828386,4,B000PUBA7M,"Let me start this out by saying that we have read all of the sleep books. I even tried the 'no cry' book and i was crying from lack of sleep! So, on the advice of our pediatrician and all of our friends to try out some crying, I got this DVD. (Let me preface this by saying, I know the lines of 'letting them cry' are a source of GREAT amounts of anger among some parents, but here let me just say that it's like anything else in parenting - tough. You make decisions as a parent and those decisions are often different than other parents, and it's all shades of gray where there is no right or wrong, but what works for you.)

So, in review of this DVD - we read all the books and tried most of the advice, but were frustrated with actual implementation to get some sleep. Books are great resources, but when you're tired, the last thing you want to do is sift through 200+ pages of advice and theory. Also, many books talked about the science of sleep, but I don't  need much convincing in this department - we all do need sleep! The advice on this DVD is a combination of pieces of all other sleep plans, but the difference is showing you how to put them in place, without all that other stuff that you're too tired to read through!

This DVD helped us put a real plan in place from the first day. It's good to see other parents struggle on the DVD and have the authors walk them through implementing a plan. It's short, to the point and very helpful. There's also a section on naps and another on night weaning. On their web site you can print out a sleep plan.

We're now up to one hour naps for our 4-month-old, and waking only once during the night! This is great. I recommend the plan and the DVD.",1299369600,2,1705,4.141993957703927
2828387,5,B000PUBA7M,"Below is an excerpt from the thank you email that I just got through sending to the creators of The Sleepeasy Solution this morning, I wanted to be sure to share with everyone else as well:

""I just wanted to take a moment to say THANK  YOU! I bought your book and your DVD to help my 7 month old baby boy learn to sleep. . . we've been dealing with multiple night wakings (up to 5-6 each night) I started your program on Friday night (yes, just 4 days ago) and last night (his last night of night weaning at 1 oz per bottle) he slept from 7:15 pm - 7:45 am straight through. . . not a peep when he went down awake, not a peep all night long.

A little about my story - as a first time mom at 32 years old I had NO idea that nursing my baby to sleep for the 1st 5 months, rocking him every time he woke up and eventually getting him hooked on the bottle on night long would cause so many issues. At about the 5 month mark I began immersing myself in sleep training literature. I read every single sleep training book out there - Weissbluth, Ferber, Pantley, you name it. But I did all this in vain to a degree, still holding out hope that one day he would just magically learn to sleep (funny, right?!)

Last Thursday night I had a work event and my husband was out of town - my Mom watched my son and he cried for 3 straight hours in her arms (from 7 pm - 10 pm) His normal bedtime was around 6:30 pm so he was beyond exhausted by the time I got him. I just KNEW he would go down and sleep all night long after being awake for so long (even though I know all the info about an overtired baby) He was up 6 times that night. I decided the next day to start sleep training. I was so tired, I popped in your DVD to learn the basics quickly and began that night. He cried off/on for about 2 hours the 1st night at his first night waking. . . but took to the night weaning much better than expected. The 2nd night he slept great, 3rd night we had about 30 min of crying at his first night waking. Last night he went down w/out a peep and my husband called me this morning after my workout to tell me that he was still asleep at 7:45 am. I am on cloud 9!! I told my husband I think I'm happier today than I was on my wedding day - haha! Tonight will be our first night completely night weaned, so we aren't out of the woods yet, but just the general improvement over the last several nights is enough to make me a believer. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!""

I highly recommend the DVD if you are sleep deprived and can't make it through the book, its easy to understand and clear, simple instructions are spot on. I am absolutely amazed that it's worked so quickly for us.",1297123200,,2667,3.968283582089552

2828389,5,B000PUBA7M,"Our daughter was 8 months old and still sleeping in our room. We had finally graduated her from sleeping in our bed to a play pen, but still in our room. She would wake up every 2 - 4 hours wanting a bottle or to be rocked back to sleep. We were so exhausted that I began searching for a method we felt we could live with to get her into her own room. I knew I didn't want to just put her in her crib and let her ""cry it out"". That just seemed too cruel. I researched online and found ""The Sleepeasy Solution"". I have to be honest and found that the most appealing thing about this product was that it came in a DVD format. We are super busy, as most parents are, and wanted a solution we could establish quickly. After watching, we gained the confidence to try it. I was so worried because I knew that our daughter would be one of the babies that would just cry and cry forever, because that's what she already did in our arms as we tried to rock her to sleep. The night we decided to implement this program, my husband and I set a limit to how long we would make our daughter cry before giving in for the night and try again the next night. We weren't going to let it go on for more than 45 min. We had gone through all of the preparation; blacked out the windows, bedtime routine in her room, bottle, rocking and a book. Then came the most nerve wracking thing for any mother: I had to put my baby down, awake, and walk out on her. We went in our room with our sleep log and wrote down the time. I was already in tears, because I can't stomach just walking away from her. And then a miracle! After only 2 1/2 MINUTES our daughter had stopped crying! I couldn't believe it! I was ready for her to wake up 2 hours later like she always does. I didn't hear her even whimper until 2am and she only did it once. We didn't need to feed her, because our doctor had already told us we needed to stop the night feedings and we just didn't know how. She slept from 7:30pm until 6:30am. I couldn't believe it. We have been doing the program for almost 2 months and we have only had to go back in her room after we put her to bed a few times. During that time she was teething.

I went into this with an open mind. I know all babies aren't the same and it might not work in all cases. We felt the freedom to adjust it to our own daughter's needs. I tell everyone one about this program. I think I was the biggest reason as to why it took us so long to get her into her own room. I just couldn't let go. I was too afraid of the unknown. I am unbelievably happy with the results. Our daughter is so rested and even does great with the naps. We were able to start on the naps the very next day and have still had success.

It took less than an hour to watch the DVD and we started that night with great success in a less than a week!  Naps are still a work in progress but bedtime is very smooth!  (we didn't start nap training at the same time)  We tried one nap yesterday and it went very well though!

2828398,5,B000PUBA7M,"We just used the Sleepeasy Solution on our 14 1/2 month old and I am amazed at how well it works! I am a nurse (12 hour nights) and between that and our daughter's poor sleep (refusing to go to sleep, waking up frequently, tossing and turning, and the worst - cosleeping with us!) I hit a wall with tiredness and was unable to function due to lack of sleep. We chose this program based on reviews. I have friends and coworkers who used the Ferber method, and I'm sure that's fine as well, but this just made more sense to us. My husband wasn't comfortable with long stretches of crying, and we had never done any sort of sleep training before. We went with the video because we simply don't have time to read a book these days. It worked the first time we did it - she was asleep in 30 minutes, slept soundly for 11 hours, and I woke up feeling like a new person and a more fun and energetic mom! The last few nights she has fallen asleep in 5 minutes. Naps are a breeze. There have been one or two regressions, but if you stick with the directions it works out. Amazingly, we even stopped the cosleeping habit without a single protest, and I thought that was going to be horrible to reverse. One of the things that made the biggest impression on me was remiding parents that, while the crying is heartbreaking to hear in this moment, you need to remember that picking them up and rocking and whatever else hasn't taught your baby/child to sleep well so far, so it is not doing your child any service to do it again. Try doin something distracting to make the minutes go by faster - load the dishwasher, watch a movie, play music, read - that helped me a lot - otherwise I would have cried right along with her!

2828400,5,B000PUBA7M,"I purchase this DVD along with 3 other books,""Good night Sleep tight"",""Solve your child's sleep problem""and""The no cry sleep solution"". This DVD(and also Ferber's book)is by far the BEST.

Before implementing the technigues, my 6 months old baby's sleep habits were getting worse and worse to the point where she woke up some nights 6 times!! My husband and I were so exhausted. When she woke up, we had to rock/nurse/binky depending on what worked at that moment. It took a toll on everyone. My baby was also effected. She seemed tired and had little energy during the day.

Since I read a lot of books before implementing the program, I decided to go with my OWN PLANS. I combined the tips from different books and created into my own. Our big problem at that time was that there was no way we could let our poor baby girl cry everytime she woke up and don't nurse her at all. Therefore; I followed Kim West's tip by setting the time I would feed her at night and the other times she woke up, I would let her cry.

After a week of trying,things were not much better. She still woke up about2-3 times crying. I realized either the CIO thing didn't work for us or I didn't do it right. Thank God I decided to give it another try and change my ways.

I decided to follow the Sleepeasy Solution DVD. It is very organized and the booklet they give you along with the DVD is super helpful. It is short and straight to the point. I didn't need a lot of info anyways cuz I already read a lot of books about sleep as I mentioned. The DVD is full of helpdful info about sleep schedule,night weaning and sleep training. To see the real families trained their babies is really encouraging becuse you can see the result.

After following the night weaning plan,before I knew it, my baby who used to sleep 3 hrs max now sleeping about 9 hrs streth (we are on the second week of sleep training and the first week of being consistant with the Sleepeasy Solution) What I did was I cut down the minutes I nursed her from 10to 8 and 6in 3 nights. I never got shorter than 6 though(as recommended to cut it back to 2 minutes). I figured it would be very frustrating for both of us to just nurse for 2 or 4 minutes. So after 6 minutes, I weaned her from ALL night feedings.

Now, it is super easy to put her down at night. I just feed her dinner,nurse,bath,book and the final thing we do is I will sing and dance with her for like 2 minutes, kiss her goodnight and lay her down. It has been 3 days that she never makes a peep. She just goes right to sleep. It is unbelievable to know that my baby can put herself to sleep.

There is still a little bump along the road though. She still doesn't do 11 hrs straight. After 9 hrs, she always wakes up and cries. Sometimes, she will go back to sleep a little more. Sometimes, I have to nurse her. Well, to those mothers who have similar problems, I am sure you will say 9 hrs is already a heaven. I am already very happy and proud of the hard work we have done. It is all worth it. This DVD is truly amazing.",1247961600,4,3034,4.193825042881647

2828403,5,B000PUBA7M,"Before we discovered Sleepy Planet, our life consisted of rocking our 9 month old son for every nap & bedtime as well as getting up 3 times a night to feed...on a good day. The one time we tried to let him ""cry it out"" on his own before this program...it took 1 1/2 hours of crying before he fell asleep...and he woke up 2 hours later. We vowed never to do that again. We had just come to the conclusion that he wasn't a good sleeper.

Then, my husband discovered Sleepy Planet. After we did the sleep training...he is an excellent napper, going down without ANY crying for each nap & bedtime, and he is sleeping through the night without eating. He slept through the night the VERY FIRST NIGHT of sleep training, but it did take us about 4 nights to wean him off his night feedings. But it has been almost 3 weeks since we did this...and our son is still sleeping through the night and is napping very well!!!!

This past weekend, I visited my mom. We stayed at her house, and our son went down for all his naps & bedtime just as easily as he does at home. And...he still slept through the night. This is something that would NEVER have happened before this program.

We used both...the book and the DVD. My husband and I both watched the DVD, but I read the book. And, I'm sure we will be referring to this book & DVD many times...through the changing sleep schedules, teething, etc. This book seems to cover every sleep problem.

2828440,5,B000PUBA7M,"Finally after 6 months of co-sleeping with our son, we were able to transfer him to his own crib.  Now just 3 days shy of his 7 month birthday, he is sleeping through the night!!!  This is quite an improvement considering a month ago he was nursing every hour, practically, from 7pm til 7am.  I'm beginning to feel rested for the first time in a loooooooong time.  The first night was the hardest, but it was so worth the 30 minutes of crying it took him to fall asleep on his own.  Now he's a pro at sleeping 11- 12 hours a night and taking two 1-2 hour naps a day! Hallelujah!!
The DVD had a baby around our son's age that was placed in the crib in a way I wouldn't have thought of (in the corner).  This placement prevented my son from rolling over and fussing (something we had a problem with) so for that little piece of information the DVD was invaluble!  Also it allowed my Husband and Mother to watch it without having to read the book, for when they would be trying to get our son to sleep.",1207612800,2,999,4.1450777202072535
2828441,5,B000PUBA7M,"At nearly two years old my son still slept poorly, waking early, often, and skipping naps.  Since his birth, I had read all the popular sleep books, as well as academic journal articles, and had even taken my son to a specialist, but to little avail.  A few weeks ago, in yet another wave of desperation, I checked the Sleepy Planet website and saw that not only was their book out, but that this video was available as well.  I immediately got my hands on both, and my son is now sleeping through the night and taking daily naps!  Once in bed, he puts himself to sleep with no crying.  He even chortles with pleasure as he snuggles under his blanket.  This was largely accomplished in a single 24 hour cycle with no crying episode lasting over 10 minutes.  The best part, though, is that after my mother-in-law visited last week, we were able to get immediately back on track, and, as parents with older kids will appreciate, that is the key to long term success.

The Sleepy Planet program is superior because it is at once easy to follow, yet comprehensive.  The video is a godsend.  As another reviewer commented, my husband, too, would never read a self-help book, but, with the promise that it was less than an hour long, I did get him to watch this video, and it has made all the difference.  My previous explanations of what I had read didn't make a lasting impression on him, but after viewing this video we are finally on the same page and working consistently as a team. Our son has responded beautifully.

The authors do a masterful job of combining the best of the popular approaches: the regular check-ins of Ferber, the scheduling ideas and concern for easy implementation of Weissbluth, the gentleness of ""No Cry"" (My son actually cried less with this than with ""No Cry""), as well as offering some useful suggestions for co-sleeping families (see especially their book).  In addition, the program (1) provides emotional support for parents and shows the parents how to support the child.  This is conveyed especially well in the video, and, as a 2-year veteran of sleep issues, I can attest that without addressing the emotional needs of both parent and child, no technique is going to work for very long.  (2) The author's suggestions are also very concrete.  They virtually tape marks on the floor and hand you cue cards!  They tell you how to set up your child's room, how to dress him, how long to keep him in bed, etc.  This attention to detail is a boon to sleep-deprived parents, and the suggestions work.  (3) At just about every potential stumbling block they are there ahead of you, offering their sensible, easy-to-implement guidance.  Every place I used to get derailed, they have thought through and offer a solution that is consistent with the overall practice they advocate.  (The book is the best place to go for this detail and for special circumstances and developmental issues; the Q&A session at the end of video is also helpful.)

My whole family is happier now.  My son is thriving on this regime as never before and he's proud of his ability to sleep well.  Within a day or two of starting the program he lay down on a blanket in the living room and, with a big smile, and announced that he was ""practice sleep!""",1207353600,12,3251,4.604166666666667
2828442,5,B000PUBA7M,"I ordered this for my wife and I after our (at that time) 9 month-old daughter started having trouble sleeping through the night. Everything that had worked before stopped, and we got to the point that going to bed caused us anxiety, as we never knew on which night she'd wake us up 3 or 4 times, screaming. Does this sound familiar?

Anyway, we ordered the DVD, watched the part that covers the basic sleep method, and implemented it that night. Our daughter was clearly unhappy with the changes, and screamed through the 5, 10, and first 15 minute checks, then went to sleep...for 11 hours straight. On night #2 she screamed, albeit half-heartedly, for 2 minutes, and was out for another 11 hours. I don't know why or how, but this system works. We are no longer bleary-eyed or edgy; our baby, now almost 1 year, is happier than ever (and she's always been pretty happy); and life has a rhythmn now that is consistent. Whenever she's had trouble falling asleep since, at night or for naps, we just go back to the checks, and she falls asleep quickly. We're very thankful.",1205107200,4,1073,4.5595854922279795

The first night was tough I'm not going to lie, after an hour of screaming my son put himself down. The next night my husband and I were ready for another tough night.

2828457,5,B000PUBA7M,"My 4 month old baby was not able to fall asleep on her own for naps and her naps were only lasting 20-30 minutes. I was spending a ridiculous amount of energy on getting her to go to sleep every day and since she was taking 4-5 naps a day, I felt like I could never leave the house and was generally frustrated and tired of bouncing her to sleep with a pacifier and trying to transfer her to her crib without waking her.  I was also wondering when the right time was to start weaning her night feedings, as I was getting a lot of conflicting advice from various sources, including my pediatrician.

After reading several sleeping books and getting so confused over all the
different and ambiguous approaches/opinions, I bought this DVD as a
last desperate attempt for a clear sleeping plan.

I really like this DVD for several reasons --

1. In addition to night time sleeping, it has additional specific plans
for napping and for night weaning
2. It's very clear and easy to follow, even if your baby wakes up at
different times every morning (like mine does)
3. They have a lot of good sleeping tips, in general, that I didn't
know about (even after reading all those books)
4. They filmed real life examples to make you feel better about the cry
it out approach - you can see what other parents went through and the
positive results and how it can work for you

After using the DVD for @ 5 days, we're now able to get our baby down for naps with minimal and sometimes no crying, and her 1st nap of the day now usually lasts 60-90 minutes long. We're still working on lengthening the other naps but I feel like we are making good progress.

I wish I had bought this DVD when we were training her to go to sleep at night because it took us 2 weeks to get her to go to sleep at night without crying and I think we could have trained her a lot faster if we had watched this DVD from the get go. The techniques in the DVD seem to be a lot more effective than what we were doing. I haven't started the night weaning yet because I don't think she's ready but I'm planning to do it in the next couple of weeks and the recommendations in this DVD make a lot of sense.",1199232000,5,2161,4.195180722891566
2828458,5,B000PUBA7M,I found this DVD incredibly helpful. I watched it and was able to retain the ideas because you can see actual families going through the process. Our son is 5 months and within 2 days this made a huge difference in my sons sleeping both at naps and bedtime. We now understand naps and when he needs to sleep both day and night. We have a plan and are incorporating the routines. We saw noticeable improvement until he became sick with a cold while cutting teeth so the plan took a back seat for a few days.

It doesn't seem normal or healthy to leave a baby alone to cry and not be touched for the whole night.  The strained, worried expressions on the parents' faces on this DVD as they watched their babies cry was awful.

There are many other mothers who are unwilling to dammage their bond with their baby by leaving them to cry themselves to exhaustion under some guise of teaching them to fall asleep on their own. This quick-fix method may sell, but it isn't my idea of loving parenting. Why should we nurture our babies through the day and then isolate them at night, ignoring their real needs for closeness and nighttime nursing?
