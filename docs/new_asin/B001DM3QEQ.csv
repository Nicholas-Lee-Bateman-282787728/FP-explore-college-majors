8434591,1,B001DM3QEQ,"This DVD was PAINFUL to watch. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! These comedians are NOT funny at all!! Dude Kenny Williams has one of the fakest laughs and lamest jokes i have ever heard. Cool Herm was the wackest then he had the nerve to come onstage in a boogie ass red suit. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING OR RENTING THIS DVD!!!
