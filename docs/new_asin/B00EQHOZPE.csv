Review by Marty Petersen
This DVD is a great DVD on the Dampfbahn Furka Bergstrecke (DFB) railway that runs over the Furka Pass in the beautiful Swiss Alps.  The DVD is produced by Rail Trails International and will take you on the original Glacier Express route of the Fulka Oberalp Railway now the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn from Realp to Oberwald Switzerland.
The Fulka Oberalp railway built this line in 1926 and it opened to through passenger service as part of the original Glacier Express route in 1929.  This route was plagued by large amounts of snow and avalanches that made year round operations over the Fulka Pass impossible.
Avalanches were such a major problem for the line over the Fulka Pass, that shortly after the line was first opened, one avalanche came crashing down and completely destroyed one of the lines stone arch viaducts.  This viaduct would be replaced with the Stefan-Bach Bridge (which you will see being assembled in the DVD) which would be disassembled each fall as the snow came and then reassembled in late spring after the threat of avalanches had ended.
Until 1982 when the Fulka Oberalp Railway opened the Fulka Base Tunnel, the railway line over the Fulka Pass would shut down late each fall and then reopen in later spring and you will see crews working to clear the line of deep snow.  The Fulka Base Tunnel made year-round operation possible, and it also made the original line route surplus and with that the idea of saving the line for a tourist operation was born.
In this great DVD you will see in the DFB crews working to restore the line over the Fulka Pass for operation, with tunnel work going on, work on the bridges and, road crossing and right of way maintainers.  You will also see DFB hunt for the lines original locomotives which happened to be halfway around the world in Vietnam.  You will even go inside the Dampflok Werk Meiningen Steam Shop in Meiningen, Germany to see the rebuilding of these locomotives.
Then you will take a ride behind DFB #1 fully restored pulling its train up the Fulka Pass in beautiful sunshine, and soon your will reach Tiefenbach Station at 1849 meters above sea level and pass through the 1874 meter long Fulka Pass Tunnel.
Your train will then stop for water at the Muttbach-Belvedere station and then you will start your descent towards Gletech and the amazing Rhone Glacier and the unspoiled nature of the Swiss Alps.  To ride a steam train in the Swiss Alps is just wonderful, but to travel over the Fulka Pass and by the Rhone Glacier is a trip of a life time and this DVD will even take you inside the Rhone Glacier through a manmade tunnel.
You will also see the villages and workshops of the DFB in Realp, Gletsch, and Oberwald and even better yet the camera crew will take you inside the cab of the locomotives as it works its way up the pass towards the Rhone Glacier.  Even if you're not a Railfan, you will enjoy this DVD and if it does not make you want to go to Switzerland to see the Alps, the DFB railway, and the Rhone Glacier you really must seek help lol.",1487030400,,3134,4.59391771019678
