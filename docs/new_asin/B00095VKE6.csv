8057378,5,B00095VKE6,"I thought this dvd video was well put together! I am a huge Marilyn Monroe fan and have been for many years. There is early footage of her and of Joe DiMaggio, in particular, that I had not seen before. I had always wondered about his background before he became a baseball star and during, like who he originally married, etc. I was also pleasantly surprised at seeing some footage of the ""so called"" wrong door raid event that had involved Frank Sinatra.
This documentary gives in insightful look further into Joe and Marilyn like I had not seen before. Highly recommended!!
If you are a fan of either of these American personalities, I highly recommend getting this for your dvd collection. Now, if we can only get it on bluray format at some point, that would be outstanding.",1395360000,2,779,4.611510791366906

8057380,5,B00095VKE6,"This DVD was very well done! As you watch the footage the female narration is done in a very tasteful way, explaining Marilyn Monroe's life and Joe DiMaggio's as well. It goes on to explain when they meet and their relationship, until the end. I really enjoyed this DVD and saw some clips that, I had not seen before. In addition to the relationship of Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio, there is a lot of extra special bonus material, which really surprised me. I was not expecting that, but I enjoyed watching it! This is a great addition to anyone's collection for a fan of Marilyn Monroe or Joe DiMaggio! On the front of this DVD, on the bottom, in small print states: This DVD Is Neither Endorsed Nor Authorized By The Estates Of Joe DiMaggio or Marilyn Monroe."" I hope that this will help in your decision, whether you may or may not want to purchase this DVD. Happy Viewing! I like to always add what is listed on the back side of the DVD's that I review. What follows is what is on the back of this DVD:

Hollywood Couples
Marilyn Monroe & Joe DiMaggio
 It was the biggest romantic pairing of the 20th century! Two genuine American heroes under one roof! Giuseppe Paolo DiMagggio, Jr. and Norma Jean Mortensen. The Yankee Clipper and M.M. But we'll always think of them as JOE DiMAGGIO and MARILYN MONROE- the baseball slugger and the blonde bomshell. They met in early 1952 and in less than two years, Joe and Marilyn were married. Their wedding made headlines around the world, but during their honeymoon, Marilyn performed for American soldiers in Korea, causing a near-riot. DiMaggio didn't like the idea of thousands of strange men drooling over his bride. He wanted a housewife; she wanted to continue her career. By the time 1954 drew to a close, they were divorced, but their legendary whirlwind romance lives on in this remarkable documentary, showcasing their amazing lives thru newsreel footage, film clips, and rare photos.
::DVD BONUS::
As a special bonus, this DVD contains rare newsreel footage of Joe and Marilyn, plus Hollywood Remembers Marilyn Monroe, an affectionate and revealing portrait of M.M., including scenes from her greatest films.
