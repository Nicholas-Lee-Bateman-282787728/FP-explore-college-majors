213741,5,6300181545,"This film is one of the greatest sentimental dramas of all time (second only to ""It's A Wonderful Life"").  It was a tremendous success on its origianl release, and rightly so.  Bing Crosby's performance (and  everyone else's, for that matter) is stupendous, and the direction is  brilliant.  I also, as a Roman Catholic, love how this film is one of the  few Hollywood movies to give the Church an even break.  I have high company  in this regard, for this film was a favorite of Pope Pius XII.",939859200,7,494,4.534090909090909

213748,5,6300181545,"Saying I love this Best Picture Oscar winner of the forties would be an understatement.  At every turn, a fun, poignant, dramatic story of faith, goodness, love and sacrifice.  The music and songs are rich with love including the boys choir.  As it builds, Going My Way, shows a side of a much more richly connected time in American cities and parishes.  The ending will guaranteed knock you over with tears of joy.  I cannot imagine all the blessed movie audiences of those times and the tears streaming down their cheeks with love - as I have every time I view this masterpiece of goodness.",1517961600,,592,4.6

I love this movie and realized I'd watch it over and over (over time), which I have. It's a wonderful story and it has nice, clean humor.

213781,2,6300181545,Great story but the dvd quality is really awful.  I don't know why Starry Night Video didn't remaster it.  Maybe it was the best they could do?  There are whole scenes out of focus and the audio comes in and out.  I'm tempted to try to buy another copy in the hopes that I get to enjoy the story instead of being distracted and annoyed by the fuzzy picture and glitchy audio.  UPDATE: I did purchase a Universal Cinema Classics copy--crisp and clear visual and audio!!!  I was really surprised at how much I missed (especially of the humor ;)  ) because of the poor quality of Starry Night.  Great movie!,1487721600,,604,4.378378378378378

213822,5,6300181545,"This is a beautiful black-and-white musical comedy where a young priest comes to the aid of an older priest without him knowing so. A clash of values takes place between the two generations as they also try to solve the church's economic problems as well as the problems of community members. Bing Crosby delightfully plays the young priest and he does a great job at making connections with the young people, something that Father Fitzgibbons is not so good at. Music becomes part of the story when Father O'Malley (Crosby) uses it to make a chorus with the neighborhood children, and then makes attempts to use this chorus to sell records to help the church. Besides the musical scenes with Crosby and the kids, I also enjoyed a scene of the play Carmen where Rise Stevens sings Habanera. Among the songs, I enjoyed The Day After Tomorrow, Silent Night, Swinging on a Star, Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral, an Irish Lullaby sung by Crosby for Father Fitzgibbons. This film is deep in feeling, but there are no tear-jerkers here. The film gets its feeling across without recurring to corny sentimentality. I think it is a rare Hollywood film about people doing things for others. Very enjoyable!",1464307200,,1186,4.876237623762377

You don't have to be a Catholic or even religious to understand Fr. O'Malley's struggles or his good will, which consequently begins a domino effect of good deeds around him throughout the movie.

213859,5,6300181545,"An enduring classic thats hard to fault in any way.
Father OMalley (Bing Crosby) arrives to help a struggling parish.  He is soon put at odds with the elder pastor (Barry Fitzgerald as Father Fitzgibbon) who does not appreciate or want his help, unaware that Father OMalley is actually there to take charge and rectify the ongoing problems plaguing this church.
This film is a joy to watch from start to finish.  Barry Fitzgerald is an absolute wonder to behold.  Even when hes snide, he has a way of delivering his denouncement with a twinkle.  The entire cast is well up to the challenge.  This film could so easily have gone in the opposite direction, turning into an ooey-gooey mess of treacle and sentimental twaddle.  Instead, the story feels real, genuine.  By any definition, this film is incredibly heartwarming.  The ending alone is well worth the watch.

213874,3,6300181545,"I like classic, feel-good movies but this one is not one of my favs. Just a bit too ""corny"" for lack of a better word. I also didn't like the music very much. If you don't like the kid's tune: Three Blind Mice, give this one a miss, that song keeps coming up in this movie. I hate the words in that song, never understood why that was considered a children's song, even before this.

Bing Crosby is good in this and very believable as a priest but the story itself seemed to ramble on and on with not much point to it overall. It may be an Academy Award winner but it wasn't anything special IMO.",1437782400,,596,4.094017094017094

The rest of the film is great as well with fine performances all around (the weakest being Crosby, which isn't to say he's bad; he's more than competent, it's just that the supporting players give much richer performances), but the ending really makes it.  If ever a movie was warm and sweet without being saccharine, it's this one.  Leo McCarey's films, particularly this and 'Make Way For Tomorrow,' burst at the seams with love of people, faults and all.  Such a lovely film, one with many small pleasures that make it worth watching again and again.",1430697600,,712,4.747967479674797

Bing Crosby's movies leave you feeling good about God, your neighbor, & life in general.  There is always hope as long as you have faith in God & family & friends who will hold you to account for your actions.  The music, especially ""Ave Maria"" & ""The Mule"" lift our family's spirits & make us laugh every time we watch GMW.  We watched it twice tonight because we get such ""a kick"" out of the antics of the teens in this movie & the way Bing as Fr. O'Malley works with them.

But movie audiences loved it and made it the biggest hit of the year, and if you give it a little time, you might also find its sincerity working its way into your heart. Under McCarey's considerable skills, Going My Way never strikes a wrong note and manages to hit some surprisingly poignant ones, particularly the final scene, which is likely to leave you in tears. Bing Crosby won his only Oscar as the young priest, and Barry Fitzgerald won for his supporting performance as the older pastor. The rest of the cast is fine, including Gene Lockhart as a mortgage banker, William Frawley (best known as Fred Mertz on the classic I Love Lucy TV series) as a talent scout, and Metropolitan Opera diva Ris (pronounced REE-seh) Stevens playing ... well ... an opera diva.

214546,3,6300181545,"It's real possible you've seen this one on TV at some point, but I don't remember watching it all the way through before. It was sweet, really sweet.

Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby) has been assigned to ""assist"" Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald, in the part he seems to have been born to play), the priest who has been at St. Dominic's for 45 years. In fact, he built it. But the Bishop thinks Fitzgibbon is getting too old, and he's really looking for O'Malley to be in charge without hurting Fitzgibbon's feelings.

Father O'Malley is modern, and what's more wears a St. Louis Browns jacket and grew up in St. Louis. I guess that does bias me in his favor, but there's also the fact that he sings as beautifully as Bing Crosby, you know? He rescues an 18-year-old girl who has run away from her over-strict parents. He turns the local juvenile delinquents into a choir, pacifies the old grouch who holds the mortgage on the church, and generally does all sorts of good, kind things in an artful, gentle way.

He also writes songs, including the title song ""Going My Way"" which is not very good, and ""Swinging on a Star"" which is, of course, just great. He runs into an old girlfriend, who just happens to have become the star of the opera ""Carmen"" and is played by a real opera star, Rise Stevens. She likes O'Malley's song ""Going My Way,"" and sets up an audition of it with a song publisher at the opera house with O'Malley playing piano, the boys choir doing backup, and she sings the main part quite beautifully. But the publisher is not interested. He says it's too good for his cut-rate publishing company. But he accidentally overhears the kids and O'Malley sing ""Swinging on a Star"" and loves it. That he wants to publish.

Just when O'Malley has things under control and is attempting to persuade Fitzgibbon to take that trip to Ireland to visit his mother that he's been planning for 45 years, the church burns to the ground. Of course O'Malley finds a way to raise the money to rebuild.

It's classic schmaltz, but it's pleasant schmaltz. And one of the kids in the choir is the one who played Alfalfa in the Our Gang comedies. A sweet movie, like I said.",1337040000,6,2169,4.5229591836734695

Bing could portray a Man of God, and once the film was completed, they believed.
Its a great little story that takes its time with great actor/actresses in
showing the world their little world and the people attached to it.
  There is a quality in the old black and white movies from the early years that
is certainly not present in the films of today. So if you are able to relax a bit,
take your time..choose your day and do enjoy this little golden flick.

214640,5,6300181545,"I suppose I will always have a soft spot for this film if for no other reason than during my Catholic boyhood of the 1960's, in both my church and parochial school I was fortunate enough to know several young priests that were very much like Bing Crosby's Father ""Chuck"" O'Malley, warm, humorous, bright, kindly and engaging without being overly sanctimonious.  Yet, like Father O'Malley they took their religion seriously but wore it lightly, and we students and altar boys were treated with respect, with not even a hint of impropriety.  Yes, I was extremely blessed and lucky, and viewing this movie brings back fond, nostalgic memories of those gentlemen who positively influenced my life.  That being said to be honest I do have to say I also knew some stern, rigid, cantankerous clerics as well the way Barry Fitzgerald's Father Fitzgibbon could be at times, and they weren't always aged either!

Saint Dominic's, a Roman Catholic parish in one of Manhattan's inner city neighborhoods in the early 1940's, is facing hard times.  The elderly pastor Father Fitzgibbon (Fitzgerald) is wearied and burned out after devoting over 40 years of hard work to his parish, and the reins of control are beginning to slip through his fingers.  The mortgage on the church is in arrears for several months, and the bank is pressing for payment.  There is a teenage gang of boys in the parish that is well on the way to juvenile delinquency.  Enter Father O'Malley (Crosby), a youthful, progressive priest appointed by the bishop to take over and put St. Dominic's back on its feet again.  However, Father O'Malley doesn't want to hurt Father Fitzgibbons feelings, so he is secretly in charge, and officially the new curate and assistant.  Initially the relationship is a rocky one, Father Fitzgibbon's age and conservative, traditional outlook clash with the younger priest's easy going, enlightened ways.  However, by the films conclusion they have both come to appreciate and respect one another, developing a strong almost father/son relationship, and St. Dominic's having weathered and survived a tragedy is rising out of the ashes like a phoenix, the stronger for it.

Playing Father O'Malley was Bing Crosby's bridge in motion pictures from crooner and comic to an actor who sang.  Like his singing, his acting looks deceptively easy and simple; at its best the naturalistic style is very reminiscent of Spencer Tracy.  This is a rich, thoughtful performance full of nuanced detail, and well deserving of the Best Actor Oscar that was bestowed on Crosby.  So as not to disappoint his fans, Bing also sings several songs flawlessly including the delightful ""Swinging on a Star!"", ""Ave Maria"", ""Too Ra Loo Ral Loo Ral"", and the title song but they are not gratuitous; all are pertinent to the story.

When we first meet Father Fitzgibbon, he's not very likeable, although careworn and befuddled he's too crusty and austere for no good reason towards the very sympathetic Father O'Malley. However Barry Fitzgerald is such a skilled player, that he soon reveals the priest's vulnerability as someone who has grown old and tired through his dogged devotion to St. Dominic's and his parishioners.  As we begin to understand him better, he becomes very endearing, and soon we begin to like him.  Fitzgerald has an expert comic touch, and brings out the wry humor in his character.  Both Crosby and he play superbly off one another like two champion athletes; each brings out the best in the other.  Fitzgerald made Oscar history in the first and only time that an actor was nominated in both the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories for the same role, the rules were changed shortly thereafter to prevent additional occurances.  Fitzgerald brought home the Supporting  Actor trophy, as was right.

Mezzo-soprano Rise Stevens from the Metropolitan Opera plays opera singer Genevieve Linden, a very close friend of Chuck's who comes back into his life, and very possibly still holds a torch for him.  She has a warmhearted sincerity that works well, plus there is the added bonus of her soaring singing.  Some reviewers have complained about the aria she sings from Bizet's opera ""Carmen"" being inappropriate to the film and slowing it down.  I disagree; Ms. Stevens was a legendary, sexy, fiery Carmen and she sounds glorious.  It's fitting that at least a small portion of one of her most famous roles is captured for posterity, and what's wrong with trying to introduce the audience to a new art form such as opera?

Two seasoned character actors, Frank McHugh and Gene Lockhart give excellent support as respectively Father Timmy O'Dowd, Father O'Malley's best friend and Ted Haines Sr. the banker who holds the mortgage.  James Brown and Jean Heather are appealing as a pair of young lovers that Father O'Malley counsels. In a small cameo William Frawley, the future ""Fred Mertz"" of ""I Love Lucy"" fame is amusing as an irascible music publisher. Finally, I'd like to mention Stanley Clements and Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer (yep, from the ""Little Rascals"") who play the gang leaders that Father O'Malley sets on the right path, they have a gritty urban authenticity.

""Going My Way"" swept the 1944 Oscars winning 7 out of 10 Academy Awards, besides Bing's and Barry's wins, the major wins include Best Picture, Best Director Leo McCarey, Best Screenplay to Frank Butler and Frank Cavett and Best Song for ""Swinging on a Star!"".  I'm not sure I agree with the Best Picture, Director and Song, I think they should have been won for ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", it's director Vincente Minnelli and it's song ""The Trolley Song"".  ""Going My Way"" while an excellent film isn't as fresh, innovative and timeless as ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", but I have to confess I'm not impartial since ""St. Louis"" is one of my top all time favorite movies.

Still, this is a film that was lovingly made, and carries its own special warmth in getting out a positive message, how giving unselfishly of oneself to help others can be a very beautiful, rewarding thing.  Yet at the same time, this lesson is presented in a very absorbing and entertaining fashion without pontificating.  For me it's a must see every Christmas season, and I highly recommend it to all.  And unless you've got a block of granite in your chest, the final touching scene will bring at least one tear to your eye!",1293667200,2,6356,4.907476635514018
214641,5,6300181545,"While I will be the first to concede that director Leo McCarey's 1944 film ""Going My Way"" is somewhat dated and kind of corny to boot I really don't care. The fact is that I have loved this movie since the very first time I saw it with my parents when I was 10 or 11 years old. Watching ""Going My Way"" has been a holiday tradition for me ever since.

""Going My Way"" stars Bing Crosby as Father Chuck O'Malley, a young Catholic priest who has drawn a very difficult assignment. He has been sent by the Bishop to St. Dominic's in the inner city to help the struggling parish extricate itself from the dire financial straits it finds itself in. For 45 years this parish has been led by Father Fitzgibbon (played masterfully by Barry Fitzgerald). Father O'Malley's task is to implement the needed changes without hurting the old man's feelings...a very sticky wicket indeed! From the outset the two priests are at loggerheads over a number of issues. Over the objections of his pastor Father O'Malley plows ahead with his plans to revive the parish. He starts a boy's choir and if you look very closely you just might spot an extremely young Andy Williams in the group. Father O'Malley also dabbles in songwriting and has a tune he calls ""Going My Way"" that he has high hopes will be published and earn him some cash. This is one of the ways the the good Father hopes to get his parish out of the red.

Along the way we meet a number of other delighful charactors including Frank McHugh as Father Timothy O'Dowd and Metropolitan Opera star Rise Stevens as opera singer Genevieve Linden. Also featured in ""Going My Way"" are Gene Lockhart as mean old banker Ted Haines, Sr. and James Brown as the bankers irrepressible son Ted Jr. What is so great about ""Going My Way"" is that it will make you laugh one minute and make you cry the next. And there are some great tunes including one of Bing Crosby's biggest hits ever ""Swinging On A Star"". I just love that tune! And I must warn you....the final scene will bring a tear to your eye....guaranteed! It did the first time I saw it when I was 10 and it did again last night when I watched this film for the umpteenth time. Very touching!

""Going My Way"" was a huge hit back in 1944. The film was nominated for a total of 10 Academy Award and walked away with 7 including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. I was very pleased to discover that in 2004 ""Going My Way"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".
I am very happy about that because this film was in pretty tough shape when it first appeared on VHS in 1986. I can't wait to see the fully restored version that was released on DVD in 2007. In fact, I just ordered it! Very highly recommended!",1292544000,2,2825,4.44980694980695

Others will find it rough going indeed (Sound of Music at least had magnificent color location photography and boasted a well-known score) and wonder how this now-corny museum piece possibly scored multiple Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, etc.

Even by standards of the day, strictly routine studio schmaltz but talents of Crosby (in the sort of role he could do in his sleep) and Fitzgerald have bolstered it into something everyone interested in Oscar history should probably see once, if only to ponder what was going on in voters' minds. Speaks to the charisma of the two leads that they can overcome episodic script, a handful of predictably tedious subplots that include boring outta-left-field interludes with young priest's former flame (Rise Stevens, who brings show to a halt with an opera number), a star-crossed war-time romance between two charm-free supporting players and the antics of a juvenile delinquent boys' choir.

214704,4,6300181545,"It's always been strange for a movie buff like me to see how things change over the decades. In the 1940s and 1950s, Catholic priests were the good guys and likable actors like Pat O'Brien, Spencer Tracy and even Bing Crosby made them even more attractive. Since the '60s, Hollywood went in the opposite direction and made them villains more than anything else.

Frankly, I never found a nun who looked like Ingrid Bergman or Audrey Hepburn, or a priest who could sing like Bing Crosby, but, what the hell, er heck....better to see a positive cleric image than a negative, I believe.

The first hour of this movie was very good and the film might have wound up a favorite of mine but the second half petered out quickly and never regained steam, except for a nice ending. The films bogs down with a romance that has nothing to do with the story. The music also lost its appeal to me when Crosby's fine voice was finished for the film, replaced by the operatic high notes of Rise Stevens.

Overall, the film has a number of nice, touching moments and Crosby is very likable but the story goes on too long and is not one I would watch a second time.",1234569600,3,1147,4.400943396226415

Everybody is nice and candid (yes, even the old gossipy lady, why, there's no malice in her). The action flows like on clouds, at such an unpreoccupied pace that is so relaxing. This is the most remarkable thing about it: its lingering scenes and no hurry pace. Yes, as some one mentioned already, the chess scene is a good example of this style. Seinfeld fans might want to check if this is finally their ideal film: a film about nothing, where nothing happens... it's wonderful. But things do happen, but no one cares because it's mostly the feeling of being part in a dream that remains with you.

The story is simple enough (but so are Spielberg's -I mean, not like Antonioni, for example-), there are 2 Catholic priests, one old and one young. The bishop thinks that the old one (Barry Fitzgerald) needs to leave his place to Bing Crosby, who is much more ""progressive"" (in those times it didn't have the bad connotation it has now). But the main reason really is that the church is owing too much money to the bank; so, perhaps, a more ""progressive"" person (in the sense of one who cares more for the finances than others not so ""progressive"") might save the church (hopefully not by losing any soul). But this is not the story, at least in the surface. It's a nice and make-you-feel-good-by-going-to-church kind of movie.

Father Charles O'Malley meets pastor Father Fitzgibbons under conditions that are not ideal, but humorous. ""There is joy in giving, especially if its something you don't want."" Father O'Malley came from East St. Louis; I wonder what it was like then? He is to become the man in charge to try to fix the parish problems. We see that their parishioners are also poor. Some boys are known to the police for getting into trouble. Father O'Malley tries to advise a teenage girl to stay at home, however humble it is. Some of the humor is dated. O'Malley works with the young boys to keep them off the street and out of trouble. [No mention of their home life, but you can read between the lines.] Fitzgibbons meets with the bishop, and learns what is planned for St. Dominic's.

The film shows a double-Decker bus. [I wonder when they stopped using them?] An old friend meets ""Chuck"" and we get a few minutes of an opera. Then Mrs. Quint reports on a neighbor, and Father O'Malley visits to check things out. Which way is she going? The film turns serous again when the banker visits the apartment to find his son. The younger generation seems so different today! Then the father learns why the son quit his job. Father O'Malley has written a song, and they try to promote it to the music industry. But this song does not meet their current needs. Another humorous song has commercial merit. [No one went broke by underestimating the public.] The collection brings in enough money to pay off the parish debts. All seems well. Who said ""schmaltz"" dozen't sell?

Later we see the priests playing golf. Father Fitzgibbons plans a long-delayed trip back home. But a disaster in the form of a church fire changes everything! More news brings financial aid, but Father O'Malley will be transferred to a new parish. And so the film ends with a happy ending, and a surprise for Father Fitzgibbons. The people in this film seem to have an incredible amount of luck for that time. There is a serious question in this story: which way are you going?",1168041600,4,2186,4.602564102564102
214836,5,6300181545,"Going My Way deservedly won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Story. It is such a warm story written and directed by Leo McCarey (who also wrote Love Affair, Bells of St. Mary's and An Affair to Remember as well as directed the latter two).

The movie's warmth owed much to the wonderful performance of Barry Fitzgerald (Best Actor in a Supporting Role), as the lovable and respectable elderly Father Fitzgibbon, despite his old school of strict rules and hardships expected of a clergyman. And Bing Crosby(Best Actor), as Father O'Malley, came to rescue the old church with utmost regard of Father Fitzgibbon's delicate feeling. Bing Crosby's portrayal of a sensible, upright Father who enjoyed a close relationship with the younger generation was most impressive. The joyful and buoyant Father O'Dowd (Frank McHugh) provided the optimistic mood often needed to uplift the morale of the other two Fathers. The personal sacrifice made by Fitzgibbon, his longing to see his mother far away, the subplots of a radiant contralto of Metropolitan Opera Association (Rise Stevens) with a gold heart, the father and son money lenders, a nave run away 18-year old (Jean Heather) all make a wonderful story.

In addition, there is much good music performed by Bing Crosby (Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra, Silent Night, Swinging on a star - Best Original Music) and Rise Stevens (Ave Maria, Habanera of Carmen)with the Robert Mitchell Boychoir.

214837,4,6300181545,"If you were raised Catholic in the 20th century, you know that among the clergy, you had your staid, old-school, well, OLD-COUNTRY types, who struck bemusement--if not out and out fear--in the hearts of children and adults in the parish. Then you had your spirited, fun-loving priests (and nuns), who weren't above playing a few innings of baseball or running a sack race.

GOING MY WAY touches, very lightly, upon the clash of those two strains among the clergy of the era. As it turns out, the more traditional Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald) is more irascible than truly terrifying. And young Father O'Malley can be as all business behind the charm and easy going manner. He just knows that you win more flies with honey than vinegar. And he knows how to get things done. He also knows that he can loosen up the older priest with a few rounds of golf and some fresh air.

The plot amounts to little more than ""Let's put on a show to save the parish church."" Almost absurdly, a famous opera star (played by famous opera star Rise Stevens) shows up to help out, and high power music publishers rush to buy the young priest's ""original"" composition ""Swinging On a Star"" after hearing Bing and his choir of former street kids sing it as a lark. It's hokum, of course, but it's almost guaranteed to make viewers nostalgic for a more innocent era--even if it's one before their own time.

Film historians and popular culture scholars would likely have a field day analyzing this film as a product of the WWII era.  God and country themes are never too far from the surface, as one might expect.  And these are certainly ideals that one would not expect to be challenged in any American film of the era.  But the film is a bit more complex that its current day critics might suggest.  In its portrait of Father O'Malley as the (relatively) hip, progressive young priest, writer/director Leo McCarey reminds us that social change is always inevitable--even for those who strongly believe that spiritual truths remain eternal.",1141516800,8,2025,4.719546742209632
214878,4,6300181545,"""Going My Way"" is a multiple Oscar winner from 1944, including best picture, actor, supporting actor, director, screenplay, original story, and song.  It's also the kind of movie that's been lampooned multiple times over the years, for good reason; its naivete is matched only by its charm.  The hokey story involves a young priest who must gently take over a parish from the old priest who built the church building 45 years earlier, and his struggles to quietly do things in a new, progressive way that makes the old fella uncomfortable.  He also has to turn a street gang into a choir, guide a female 18-year-old runaway onto the straight and narrow, and cope with a mortgage that's about to swallow the parish whole.  And naturally, all of this is accomplished without anyone ever coming dangerously close to losing their temper.

It's as corny as anything you'll see, this story.  Furthermore, looked back at through the passage of time and ugly headlines, it's almost painful to see a priest in charge of a large number of young boys and a pretty teenage runaway.  But this film was made in a far different time than ours, and who's the worse for that, us or them?  Viewed as an artifact from a time when our nation was in the throes of defeating Hitler, the people sacrificing and rationing to help make it happen, this feel-very-good story must have been a real tonic.  And what's really surprising, in this cynical day and age, is that it is a tonic today as well.  Still, if they're going to have Bing pretend to play the piano while he sings, the least he could do is move his arms at least just a little bit to simulate playing.

In spite of the above misgivings, at the end of this 2-hour film I found myself wishing there were more.  Oh, yes, the story drags a bit in a few places, but by the time we sense ""The End"" approaching it makes us sad to know it's coming.  And the final scene is a tearjerker that should touch anyone's heart.

Bing Crosby plays ""Father O'Malley who has been sent to the Church of Saint Dominic to assist with the older priest Father Fitzgibbon (dearly played by 5 foot 3, born in Ireland, actor Barry Fitzgerald) who has been there for 45 years.  Young Father O'Malley is in charge of straightening out Saint Dominic since it is in the worse way without hurting the feelings of the old priest.  However, with the Bishop's understanding, Father Fitzgibbon is to stay there as the Pastor.  Father Timothy O'Dowd (Frank McHugh) of the nearby Saint Frances, drops by to offer support to his St. Louis childhood friend.  O'Malley is able to take care of the church mortgage, get the boys interested in baseball and begin a boys chior with Carl Switzer (""Alfalfa"" of Little Rascals/Our Gang) and O'Malley plays golf too.  Won Academy Award for Best Picture, Both Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald won their own Academy Award and the new song ""Swinging On A Star"" also was a winner.  ""Silent Night"" and ""Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo"" are also sung.  William Frawley has a good role (nearly eight years before he did the ""I Love Lucy"" tv series).

This movie was chosen to be preserved and was added to the National Film Registry in 2004 by the United States National Film preservation Board.

214880,4,6300181545,"At the height of his wartime fame, Bing Crosby plays a hip young Catholic priest who arrives to help a troubled parish struggle back to its feet.  Of course, what passed for young and hip back then, in this lily white, family-friendly comedy-drama may seem pretty silly these days -- Bing is convincing, though, as he use his suave social skills to listen to and help out those in need.  Veteran scene-stealer Barry Fitzgerald plays the doddering, crusty old Irish priest who runs the church before Crosby's arrival... The rest of the supporting cast isn't as strong, but the film still has its charms. Mostly it's just a great chance to observe Crosby at his most magnetic and self-assured.

214882,4,6300181545,"""Going My Way"" is not exactly one of the most perfect of all movies ever made. And it's not the most deserving ""Best Picture"" winner of 1944 either. The reasons I make those statements are 1.) It's somewhat corny and simplistic, with a few subplots and scenes that do work but still could have been left out. And 2.) Many people, including myself, would name ""Double Indemnity"", ""Gaslight"", ""Laura"", ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or ""Murder, My Sweet"" as more deserving winners. But awards aren't really the best way to judge a movie's greatness because it's a matter of personal opinion. And ""Going My Way"" is a really good movie, despite these flaws.
The movie is a great star vehicle for Bing Crosby, who portrays a priest named Father O'Malley sent to help another church run by cranky old Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). Fitzgibbon, who's run the church for 45 years (""46 in October""), is in debt problems with the savings and loans run by Ted Haines Sr. (Gene Lockhart). Fitzgibbon, at first, is not excited by his new assistant's unorthodox methods of practice, such as wearing a baseball uniform when his priest clothing gets wet. He also doesn't care much for O'Malley's liking of golf along with fellow priest Father Timothy (Frank McHugh), remarking that there is too much work to allow games. Fitzgibbon tries to go to the bishop to get O'Malley transferred. But after hearing good things about Father O'Malley and being patient, O'Malley starts to grow on him. Eventually, the old bat starts to lighten up until, by film's end, his church is out of debt and he claims to be ten years younger. He even starts playing golf and other games.
Fitzgerald is very good in the role, being sensitive or strict when the time comes. The interaction that he and Crosby have is marvelous. I also love his leprechaunish voice, which is most likely because he comes from Ireland. He received Oscar nominations for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, the only such incident in the academy's history, and deservedly won Supporting Actor.
But Bing has several very good to great scenes, which were probably a major factor in his Best Actor win. His performances of the title song and, with the help of the choir, ""Swinging on a Star"" are upbeat and entertaining. I also enjoyed the scene where he gives advice to a troubled young girl named Carol James (Jean Heather) on how to be a better singer and she follows it (A wise move I might add).
Now for the movie's problems. There are a couple scenes that could have been excised from the film at the cutting room. About half an hour through the film, after visiting the bishop, Fitzgibbon is talked into keeping O'Malley at the church. But then, he leaves the church at night only to return some hours later. What does this scene mean? I think it was meant to show Fitzgibbon is thinking about whether he wants to stay in charge, for when he returns he says its only temporarily. Also, after that scene, there is one between him and O'Malley that shows character development for Fitzgibbon in how he longs to see his mother, whom he hasn't meet in 45 years. Yet another scene that could have been taken out is when O'Malley watches a performance of ""Ava Maria"" at the Metropolitan by singer Genevieve Linden (Rise Stevens), an old friend of ""Chuck"" (The nickname used by his friends). Both the song and Steven's performance of it are great, but it doesn't do much except slow the pace. And her impressive singing isn't enough to sway a publisher into buy some of Chuck's songs.
There are also a couple of subplots. First with Carol and Ted Haines Jr. (James Brown), son of the Savings and Loans manager. This plot shows how O'Malley's advice helped the two straighten out their lives. Ted Sr. visits his son to find out why he quit his job, and finds out it was for a reason relevant to the time. There is also a plot that has some punk kids, who are more of a nuisance than a threat, getting help from O'Malley by forming a choir. By the film's end, they are straightened out and like singing even more than baseball or, the worst of their crimes, hijacking poultry trucks.
The movie has several touching moments, most notably the ending when Fitzgibbon receives a big surprise. The surprise was arranged by O'Malley whom, since he is being transferred out, did it as a farewell gift. I admit that I'm not one for crying, having been hardened by too many action movies (Plus I wasted a lot of tears of ""Titanic"" back when I was 10 years old). But my eyes were just a bit misty as the choir started ""Too-ra-Loo-ra-Loo-ra"". Maybe in a few years I will come back and find this to be even sadder. For now, I'll read more of mother's Harlequin romances.
I found certain themes here to be similar to those covered in a later movie: ""It's a Wonderful Life"". O'Malley influences and helps out many people in the movie who wouldn't have been better off without him. The only difference is that O'Malley, unlike the later film's protagonist, already knows that he has done great things before the movie ends. At the end, he walks out of the church with no formal thanks. He doesn't need one because he's the kind of person who doesn't ask in return.
With a fine supporting cast, great songs, many humorous and touching scenes, ""Going My Way"" is movie I'm glad I watched. It may not be the best Oscar winner, but it made me sigh in one respect: Though ""Double Indemnity"" is an excellent (One of my favorites), how many remakes, homages, and spoofs have been done of that compared to ""Going My Way""? I guess schmaltz doesn't sell.",1025308800,4,5569,4.609264853977845
214883,5,6300181545,"In ""Going My Way,"" director Leo McCarey taps into one of the basic tenets of human nature, that being the fact that even the most selfless individual has wants and needs that often go unrecognized or unexpressed.  It's a matter of understanding the human condition, being sensitive to what drives our fellow man and responding to it.  A young woman of eighteen leaves home because of a conflict with her parents, yet has nowhere to go; a man with a touch of ""Scrooge"" in him, who runs a Savings & Loan has trouble setting his priorities; a gang of street-wise kids need some direction; an elderly priest after forty-five years has allowed his parish to slip into financial straits.  All circumstances that are affecting in their innate humanity, and it's into this that McCarey taps directly with his story, and it's the reason for the success of his film.  Simply put, it has heart-- and it makes it timeless.
 Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald) has been at St. Dominic's in New York since it was built, but the financially strapped parish is in arrears on the mortgage payment, and Mr. Ted Haines Sr. (Gene Lockhart), of the S&L that holds the note, would like nothing better than to be able to foreclose on the church, because then he could raze the building and turn it into a parking lot.  Meanwhile, the Bishop has sent a young priest, Father Chuck O'Malley (Bing Crosby) to St. Dominic's to look into the situation, and very quickly the good Father finds that he has his hands more than full.
 Sent to take charge without ""taking charge,"" in deference to Father Fitzgibbon's tenure, Father O'Malley has his work cut out just trying to save the church; but that's not all he has to contend with.  Found alone on the street by a local policeman, a girl named Carol James (Jean Heather) is brought to St. Dominic's, and Father O'Malley realizes that without some help, she's headed for nothing but trouble.  He also encounters a lad named Tony Scaponi (Stanley Clements), the leader of the gang that has been terrorizing the neighborhood, and turning that situation around becomes a priority on Father O'Malley's ""to-do"" list.  Then there is Mr. Haines Sr. to deal with.  But most especially in need of all (though he doesn't realize it himself) is Father Fitzgibbon, and this, too, Father O'Malley recognizes.  Now it's just a matter of addressing all of these needs at once; and as Father O'Malley finds out, it's no easy task.
 There's something of the Angel, Dudley (played by Cary Grant in ""The Bishop's Wife""), in Father O'Malley, as he is not only sensitive to the needs of those he encounters, but knows how to resolve their conflicts in a way that suits the best interests of all concerned.  His solutions may be those of a perfect, pie-in-the-sky world and not necessarily a reflection of reality, but it works because it captures the spirit of what this movie is all about:  caring and lending a helping hand to those who need it.  The solutions may be unrealistic and overly simplified, but the feelings and emotions of the characters are very real, and McCarey's ability to capture that essence of humanity is what earned this film the Oscar for Best Movie of 1944 (McCarey received Oscars, as well, for Best Director and Original Story).
 As Father O'Malley, Bing Crosby gives one of his best performances, which earned him an Oscar for Best Actor.  But as good as he is in this part, the award is something of a surprise; the Father O'Malley Crosby presents has the patience of a Saint and insight to match, and his mild mannered approach to the character makes his portrayal the kind that are usually overlooked and under-appreciated because of the apparent facility of the delivery.  And Crosby does make it look easy-- which also makes it very real, striking a chord as perfect as the solutions to the problems he solves along the way.  It's interesting to note that when Crosby recreated the role a year later in ""The Bells of St. Mary's,"" though he slipped back into the character readily enough, it didn't seem to have that same depth or impact as in this one, but more of a ""been there, done that"" feel.  Then again, this story and the characters with which he is surrounded here are much richer and have much more definition than those of the sequel, and this film is much more emotionally involving.
 Barry Fitzgerald received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Father Fitzgibbon, and well deserved it was.  Father O'Malley may be the anchor of this film, but Father Fitzgibbon is it's soul.  And the final scene-- unexpected and extremely moving-- leaves no doubt about it.  That scene, in fact, so powerful in it's simplicity, veritably sums up the sentiment of the entire movie.  It's a triumph for Fitzgerald, as well as McCarey, but the one who really comes out the winner is the viewer.
 The supporting cast includes Frank McHugh (Father Timothy), William Frawley (Max), James Brown (Ted Haines, Jr.), Rise Stevens (Genevieve Linden), Eily Malyon (Mrs. Carmody), Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer (Herman) and Adeline De Walt Reynolds (Mrs. Molly Fitzgibbon).  A heart-felt and uplifting discourse on the brighter side of the human condition, ""Going My Way"" reflects the good there is to be found in humanity if we but take the time to seek it out.  An entertaining, feel-good film, this is what the magic of the movies is all about.",1009497600,33,5380,4.761033369214209
214884,4,6300181545,"On a literary level, there are many deficiencies in Going my Way, and it is no musical gem. Yet those of us who tend towards nostalgia would find this a relaxing, fun, highly memorable film.
There is no coherent plot, and action moves from one (barely developed) sub-""story"" to another. The underlying story works best when it deals realistically with life in a rather poor parish: the super-religious gossip, kids in a bit of trouble, young couple who are sleeping together (but making it sound innocent), pastor faced with financial problems, charismatic younger priest who is a good influence on the young in spite of themselves. (I must add that those of us who have known the ""real life"" counterparts of all, as I certainly have, will find it refreshing that political correctness does not distort them!) Unfortunately, several major influences in the story are distracting and rather annoying. I've known many a ""real"" Father O'Malley, and his organising kids into a group (to their great benefit) is indeed realistic, but their emerging as a highly polished classical choir in short order is absurd. Fr Chuck's totally ""by chance"" meeting with the old girlfriend who just happens to be headlining at the Met, and who both gets the entire Metropolitan Opera orchestra to present the demonstration of Chuck's tiresome tune to publishers, then arranges a highly lucrative concert tour for the now-brilliant boy choir, would have best been eliminated, since it gives the production an entirely artificial quality - as bizarre as their having been granted three wishes! Nor is anything accomplished by the church going on fire...
Yet there is enough here that one cannot help but love - and which are true but no longer possible to find. I, for one, greatly miss the days when such colourful characters as Mrs Quimp and Father Fitzgibbons were standard in many a parish - when working class, city neighbourhoods like this had not been either reduced to slums nor turned into luxury flats for the rich - when many kids were helped immensely by associations with dedicated priests. As well, it is a light-hearted, affectionate presentation, with much of the type of delightful humour that died out with Irish priests of Bing's generation.
It's like a visit to the old neighbourhood, with lots of friends with whom to renew acquaintance. For a restful few hours, one can relax and pretend that one could still turn a corner and find that it is all still there.",1008892800,7,2459,4.927710843373494
