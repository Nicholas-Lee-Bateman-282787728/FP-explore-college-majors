8576330,5,B00C1P9YKY,"A wonderful reminder of a fantastic comedienne. After my mother passed away, I started purchasing old TV shows that I would watch with her as a child. While ""I Love Lucy"" was her absolute favorite, the ""Carol Burnett"" show was a close second. If I could only find a set of complete season-by-season episodes, I would be very happy.

I received this in a timely manner and well-packaged, and would certainly purchase again from this seller.",1373500800,,439,4.776315789473684
