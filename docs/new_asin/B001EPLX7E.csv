3556984,5,B001EPLX7E,"If you would like a film about a love story that transcends time and is partially set during the turning point of The War Between the
States with all its attendant drama and loss then you will love this movie...if not what's the problem?  This movie is "" The Lake House"" on steroids...",1378252800,,285,4.377358490566038
3556985,5,B001EPLX7E,"I first saw this film on the Hallmark Movie Channel and was drawn into the story because of it's perfect blending of story and history.  After viewing the special features on the DVD copy, I understand why.  It was filmed in and around the Petersburg, Virginia area, which is not only where so many Civil War battles were fought, but where there are so many wonderful homes and buildings  from that period still intact.  A perfect place to film a period story.  Thanks.",1375488000,,469,4.602409638554217
3556986,5,B001EPLX7E,"Fantasy galore. But so well done. The acting was great. The cast is Scott Campbell and Jennifer Jason Leigh, not Kate Capshaw etc.",1369094400,,130,4.695652173913044
3556987,5,B001EPLX7E,"Oh, wow! I picked this film up because of Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is not only beautiful, but I have all of her father's work as Sergeant Saunders in COMBAT! The complete collection. I love this concept of returning for your true love, (which we handled in Avenel the Motion Picture as a ghost coming back for her when she is ready to die in 1905). But the greatest part of all was when she came back to the grave with the dog at the end... That stuck the landing for me! That is a movie I would have written!!!

They really handled the 135 years thing very well, and Jack Finney (THE NIGHT PEOPLE, after whom I named one of my Facebook Pages), one of my fav writers, write the thing. The house is real, and my hero Thomas Jefferson actually stayed there! Civil War. Love over the years... Actual contact from the dead... Yes, this story was for me, because it HAPPENED to me, for REAL...

Almost. There were no letters, but I made the official documentary of the Avenel House in 2003 called Portrait of a Plantation, and the famous NEVER MARRIED White Lady Ghost of Avenel, Letitia Burwell,  appears in a photograph I took of the home as a FULLY MATERIALIZED woman... She is looking out towards me in the photo (This photograph is in the film PORTRAIT OF A PLANTATION). Again, They used PHOTOGRAPHS in the movie, and while Letitia was never photographed nor painted in her life, she was photographed ONCE. And I TOOK HER PICTURE on November 1, 2003 at 11:59:59...

I wrote and made the movie AVENEL THE MOTION PICTURE (2005) as a tribute to her and her love for the South (and as I found out later, her love for a Captain Frank Clarke who was grievously wounded and whom she never married (read  Lucy Breckinridge of Grove Hill&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucy-Breckinridge-of-Grove-Hill-The-Journal-of-a-Virginia-Girl-1862-1864-Women-s-Diaries-Letters-of-the-Nineteenth-Century-South/dp/0872499995/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucy Breckinridge of Grove Hill: The Journal of a Virginia Girl, 1862-1864 (Women's Diaries & Letters of the Nineteenth-Century South)</a>, and also Letitia's actual diary...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-girl-s-life-in-Virginia-before-the-war/dp/1149384204/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A girl's life in Virginia before the war</a>&nbsp;and Our War by Letitia Burwell -annotated by June Goode.

3556988,4,B001EPLX7E,"I watched this movie years ago on TV and always remembered it as a movie with mystery, romance and a time travel theme and wanted to see it again... I was happy to finally find it on DVD after searching to remember what it was called (definitly don't make the same mistake I did by confusing it for another movie with the same name). I did enjoy it, although felt it was older than I remembered and a little slower moving than I had remembered. Nevertheless a true romance story with the added mystery of a letter that can somehow pass through time via an old desk between two very different times...  if you liked The Lake House you'll probably like this too and want to see if somehow the characters will defy time and end up together, although not possible of course the ending is fitting and satisfys the need for a happy ending.",1310860800,,833,4.374193548387097
3556989,5,B001EPLX7E,"My favorite movie of all time. This movie has it all, Civil War, romance & intrigue. Jennifer Jason Leigh & Campbell Scott are so good together. The switches between present-day and past are so smooth and what a great ending. Spellbinding!",1305244800,,239,4.853658536585366
3556990,5,B001EPLX7E,"If you liked ""The Lake House"" or ""Somewhere in Time"" you'll love this movie, (which also happens to be just so much better). The man (Campbell Scott) lives in modern day while the woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) lives in Civil War times (1860's).  Campbell Scott purchases an old desk at an antique shop.  While cleaning the desk, he finds a hidden compartment, inside the compartment is a letter.  In a fit of whimsy, he responds to the letter which starts a communication (through letters) which somehow transverse space and time.  I just love this movie and I hope that you will too.",1294444800,,583,4.686274509803922
3556991,5,B001EPLX7E,"Just great. Taped it on video a few years ago but video deteriorated. Very happy to find a new dvd copy. It's almost believable what goes on in the movie, I suppose I live in that type of dream world to appreciate it. Regards Stewart. 27-05-10",1274832000,,243,4.304347826086956
3556992,5,B001EPLX7E,"This is such a great movie. I ordered this version so I could hear the ""making of"" stories. I had recently been to Jamestown VA and saw some signs that made me wonder. Now I have to plan another trip to Richmond and Petersburg.",1510617600,,227,4.181818181818182
3556993,5,B001EPLX7E,"This is my favorite movie on the subject of time travel.

3556996,5,B001EPLX7E,"CAUTION:  S.T. Peterson's Nov. 2015  ""review"" of this movie is COMPLETELY INCORRECT!
i have no idea WHAT movie he is reviewing, but NONE of his references have anything to do w/this movie!!!!!

This, if anything, could be considered a type of ""sci-fi"", as the players live in two different eras, but this is a great ""fantasy"" love story  (sort of like the Beauty & The Beast TV series)  & both Scott & Jennifer give excellent performances!  An old house, part of the Civil War scenes, the costumes of that era, as well as the ""love scenes""--such as they may, being in two different places--are all lovely & sweet.  One of my favorites.",1493942400,,635,4.616071428571429

8299275,5,B001EPLX7E,This is a charming and rich story across time. It has a Civil War storyline as well as a love story that reaches across one hundred years. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who loves a sort of time travel story. It isn't really a time travel story but the two people involved live in different centuries. They communicate through letters that they place in a desk that once belonged to the woman in 1963. The man finds the desk in an antique store and buys it. He finds a letter she wrote to a mysterious non-existent lover. Their love develops across time. Very interesting.,1520380800,,578,4.462264150943396

8299281,5,B001EPLX7E,"I had this movie on VHS for years and played it over and over.
I just now watched it for the first time after 15 years or so.
I am thrilled I purchased the DVD.  This DVD version is high quality and nothing was edited out.
The price of over $20.00 precluded me from buying it for quite a while.  The price went down a little bit and now I know I did make a wonderful purchase.
Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Lee have wonderful chemistry; the story is well paced and doesn't follow the usual Hallmark template.
If you enjoy romantic time travel movies, I highly recommend this DVD purchase.",1512777600,,592,4.324324324324325
