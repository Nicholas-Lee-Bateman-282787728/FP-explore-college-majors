8076007,3,B000A7Y1BM,This is so very dated. It's not even funny. She is hard to listen too and begins to grate on your nerves after about 10 mins of watching. My husband and I both sat through this in leu of going to the classes figuring it was basically the same thing. We where so wrong! Her material is very dated for the times. She tell you at one point to sit down as soon as your water breaks or the cord could prolapse. Any Midwife or O.B. worth there salt will tell you to move as you see fit before and after your water breaks. Moving helps to relieve pain and lets the baby descend deeper in to the pelvis and later the birth canal. This should no longer be sold in my opinion. Unless she would like to take the time to revise her dated methods. I think it would be better to just attend the class at least the information given there will be current to the year we are living in and not circa 1990!,1289174400,,888,4.022598870056497
