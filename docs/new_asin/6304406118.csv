885570,2,6304406118,"I love the DC5, but this movie just didn't do it for me--or a few other posters here for that matter.  The costume party was the best scene in the movie.  Though I knew the basic plotline of the story, the dialogue was very strange, and the things that happened in it reminded me of a cross between the Monkees' Head (decidedly worse), and a colorless acid trip.  Dave Clark's character was too moody and self-righteous.  I'm guessing that's not far off the mark considering a lot of people think he's that way in real life (see reviews for the double disc History of the DC5 collection).  The Meat for Go girl had an annoying voice like a little mouse, and the rest of the band was almost non-existent save for party scenes.  All this conspires to make a movie that's nowhere as entertaining as Help!, try to be though it might, and there were only snippets of most of the band's songs.  Pretty boring, I wouldn't watch it again, and that's really too bad, but I have their music, and that's a positive.  By the way, if you don't look too close, the box cover art looks a lot like the original cover for the VHS issue of That Thing You Do!",1331164800,5,1140,4.31924882629108
885571,3,6304406118,Some pretty cool tunes..but not much of a plot..funny band scenes..but DAVE CLARK is way more a winey + proper = boring worth a watch for old times sake or maybe someone young after the bars are closed and you are prepped for this 60s  gem...almost as bad as HOLD ON/Hermans Hermits..The Beatles movies were way better..,1324771200,2,320,4.614035087719298
885572,2,6304406118,"I just viewed the movie and simply could not get through it because it was very strange.  My conclusion is that someone did not want to appear to be mimicking the Beatle movies, so they made this very slow-moving, did not focus at all on the fact that these are musicians, and did not want to merely appease their fans.  Clearly it's meant to be an ""arty"" movie because there's a lot of brooding, scenery shots, strange conversations, and things that made me go ""what?!""  I felt like I was watching this in ""real time"" at times because it took so long for things to happen.

I love DC5 so I was disappointed by this movie.  I suppose they succeeded on some level, but I would have preferred the usual fun, silliness, and music.  [I actually laughed more reading these reviews than I did while watching the movie--eg. Lenny playing a mute *LOL*]",1284249600,6,844,4.483660130718954
885573,3,6304406118,"This film, which is a cross between A Hard Days Night and the Marx Brothers, focuses almost completely on Dave Clark as stuntman (and alleged kidnapper) Steve and his relationship with meat poster girl Dinah. The other four members of the band are in the background, partying at their pad, attending a fancy dress ball, and keeping the authorities on a wild goose chase while Steve and Dinah experience one adventure after another on their way to Dinah's dream island.  In fact, I don't think Lenny Davidson says one word throughout the picture.  On their way they meet a group of half-stoned beatniks, an eccentric older couple, and other interesting folks.  The film tries to bring depth to most of the characters, except the Dave Clark 4 who remain rather vacuous fun boys.  At the time, the Dave Clark Five were promoted as a cleaner cut, non-smoking, drug-free and athletic alternative to the Beatles (probably only the latter was true, as the band members were former gymnists).  Clark's character (strong silent type, serious and rather surly to the point of self righteous) portrays this image quite well.  The film highlights two songs off their soundtrack beginning with the original movie title ""Catch Us If You Can"" and the U.S. title ""Having A Wild Weekend"". Two other songs are played from their previous album Coast To Coast: ""I Can't Stand It,"" and the quite beautiful ""When,"" which seemed to be the theme song of the film.  Curiously, other tracks from the soundtrack that would have been very appropriate for the film (""Don't Be Taken In,"" in particular) were not used. The music, save for ""When"", isn't their best material, but it's not bad.  The acting is also quite good.  British comedy fans will no doubt recognize Clive Swift (Hyacinth's hen-pecked husband Richard in Keeping Up Appearances) as a bumbling detective out to find the ""kidnapped"" Meat For Go girl.",1035763200,22,1885,4.90251572327044
885574,4,6304406118,"I was simply shocked at how good ""Having A Wild Weekend"" was after seeing it for the first time recently.  ....The DC5's film borrows the fast pace, ingenious cuts, sense of sprightly enthusiasm and b&w artiness of its forebear, but matches it with a unique plot of its own.  Rather than playing themselves, the group here are stuntmen, and the  story revolves around one of them (Steve, played by the self-described saturnine Dave Clark) taking a model out for a ""wild weekend"".  The press, egged on by her boss, turn it into a kidnapping story, and the rest of the film follows their attempt to recapture her before she gets to the island she's planning to buy.  A suitably thin plot is thickened by scenes which  are slightly ahead of their time in dramatic and cultural
content--Steve and his girl encounter a group of long-haired ex-beatniks who ask for grass and heroin, and quote Zen koans-- and all of this in 1965!  A comically bickering couple who eventually takes them in also provides for a marvellous  costume party sequence in which director John Boorman, in  his first film, shines.  The climax, in which the journey is compared to the final result, makes for an interesting discussion; the film's themes of youth vs. elders, people vs. the press/society and the resulting question of whether it was ""worth it"" or not would become the riding question of the 60s.  It's almost like an ""Easy Rider"" before its time-- the big question then becomes why the DC5 faded soon after this film's release, not being known as counterculture heavies in the least...",994377600,4,1567,4.788104089219331
885575,3,6304406118,"I have seen the movie several times and have enjoyed it but it falls short of the mark. There is too much Dave (character Steve) and not enough Mike, Lenny (who plays a mute), Denis, or Rick. The soundtrack has some good  songs but only two from the LP of the movie. The rest of the supposedly  original soundtrack is not there. Instead there is music from older albums.  To me this is a great disappointment. I happen to think that the album is  the best the group ever recorded and would have made the movie so much  better. In fact at times the music in the movie adds nothing to the  production of the film. In fact it takes away from the overall quality. For  example, at the masquerade ball the song ""I Can't Stand It"" from  the Epic LP ""Coast To Coast"" keeps repeating the same verse again  and again. It became annoying. Why didn't the group put another song into  the scene? It was a dance scene and they wanted the action to continue.  They could have played the instrumental ""On The Move"" from the  original soundtrack LP or if they had to could have chosen one of their  many hits such as ""Anyway You Want It"" for example.
As  mentioned Dave played a character known as Steve. The rest of the band was  nameless. Yet when ""Steve"" and Barbara Ferris were at that  couples house, the hostess clearly calls him David. Now you would think  they would have reshot that sequence.
Still as a lifelong fan I get  around all these flaws. I enjoy the time, early 1965, England, the weather  and the group. They didn't appear as The Dave Clark Five and maybe that is  why the movie is good. But when the movie was ending instead of playing  ""When"" from the Epic LP ""American Tour"" Dave (Steve)  should have taken Barbara Ferris in his arms, held her real tight, kissed  her and the soundtrack should have played ""Can't You See That She's  Mine"" and they should have run off together.",926553600,14,1884,4.378612716763006

But given Dave Clark's mind for business, I certainly expected more. This movie is simply bad. And except for title track and instrumental snippets of 'Whenever You're Around' (One of the best DC5 songs ever, IMHO) there isn't even any DC5 songs in it.

Sometimes these go into vaults never to be seen again. I love the 60s and only wish I wasn't only born at the end of the decade! Forget the whole idea that it's a DC5 film. The 'boys' are actually quite natural on camera probably because by then they had performed so much they were used to it. Just enjoy it for what it speaks of in the context of the period, the fact that you get to see London in 1965 is super. Don't ask too much of the film, and you will have a good 90 minutes. PS get the Glad All Over documentary at the same time to really gain context of the film - it actually was well received although probably was not what folks expected in comparison to A Hard Day's Night and Help!

Ironically, the Broadway play never materialized, though a Leonardo DiCaprio film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catch-Me-If-You-Can-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JLSB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;was released in 2002.

Unfortunately, the DC5's film debut was very disappointing. The thin plot revolves around the filming of a TV commercial for meat, and Dave (his character Steve) and his model girlfriend (Barbara Ferris) trying to get away from it all. The best moments are the DC5 songs appearing on the soundtrack: the two title songs, plus ""When"" (the film's love theme), ""Ol' Sol,"" ""Move On,"" ""Reelin' and Rockin',"" and a few others.

885804,5,6304406118,"The American title of the Dave Clark Five's movie, ""Having a Wild Weekend"" seems to utilize a bit of the advertising menace which makes a great amount of the plot of their film, known in Great Britain and previously available under that title, ""Catch Us If You Can.""  ""Having a Wild Weekend"" kind of draws attention to the Beatles' first movie, ""A Hard Day's Night.""  So, as the adage goes, what's good for the gander.  The Warner Archive has now brought us an American DVD of the film which is the first movie for director, John Boorman who would very soon later helm the fabulous ""Point Blank"" starring Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson, and also later ""Deliverance,"" ""Excalibur"" and ""The Emerald Forest,"" all very fine motion pictures.  I would not say ""Having a Wild Weekend"" is superior to the Beatles' movie(s) directed by Richard Lester, but they were certainly given due accolades at the time they were released.  The Dave Clark Five movie, thanks to Warner Archive, is getting some new insight by reviewers about its message and many of the ideas and ways that it skewers in a perhaps at times more original than simply imitating the Beatles' antics.  It is my opinion that the music of the Dave Clark Five, especially in the beginning, is extremely good listening.  Barbara Ferris, Dave Clark's female co-star, sort of became a minor sensation, starring afterward opposite Oskar Werner in the film, ""Interlude"" (now available as a Columbia Classic).  I found her to be well cast in ""Having a Wild Weekend"" and she adds to the film's power as commentary on the times, both then and now.  In the eighties, one of the cable stations featured restored versions of ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Help!"" the making of documentary: ""You Can't Do That: the Making of 'A Hard Day's Night'"" and ""Having a Wild Weekend"" which I had taped, but they were destroyed in flood waters.  Warner Archive's edition begins and ends with considerable scratches and deterioration, but it is only the credits, and the movie itself is very good quality.  Now, if only ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" or ""Seaside Swingers"" were available, more of the British Invasion could be revisited.  We needed it.",1347408000,15,2168,4.814016172506738
885805,5,6304406118,"This review is long, but to quote Pascal, I didn't have time to write a shorter one.

I watched ""Having A Wild Weekend"" the second time recently and it took on a different and more meaningful light for me.  I was expecting the general British silliness (which was there and which I love), but I thought there would be more of Dave Clark and the boys playing and singing (or lip synching, as they almost always do) - more in the vein of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help.""  Instead, after my second viewing I saw a more serious social commentary.  There are a few DC5 songs and some interesting orchestral arrangements that serve as incidental music, but calling it a DC5 movie is misleading.  Director John Boorman's black and white filming is artfully done.

Dave (who plays ""Steve"") runs off with Dinah, a famous model filming a commercial for ""meat.""  I first saw the film as a ""period piece"" set in 1965 - so you have them tooling around in a Jag XKE, wearing mod clothes, and doing a bit of silliness - but I began to see that it has a more universal theme of searching for meaning in a ""modern"" world.  (This theme is brilliantly illuminated in Ian MacDonald's observations on the Beatles and the 1960s in the introduction to his book ""Revolution In The Head,"" though not in reference to this film.)  Essentially, it is a spiritual journey, a search for something beyond ruthless commercialism, wonderfully portrayed by the advertising executives in search of the missing Dinah, whose picture promoting meat seems to be on the side of every bus and on every billboard. (""Advertising is not a game that can be played by the rules.  It is total war which must be played with any weapons which come to hand."")

Dinah envisions this utopia as an island to which she and Steve are traveling.  Things don't work out in utopian bliss for Steve and Dinah, as the advertisers gain the upper hand in the end.  (I don't want to give away the resolution of the plot.)  Dinah seems quite okay about returning to reality, but she tells the advert executive, ""You missed the journey."" - to which he replies, ""Story of my life.""

When Dinah asks Steve, ""Why don't you enjoy the journey?"" he replies, ""You give up too easily.""  Steve doesn't give up easily, and we are left thinking he may be going next to Spain with the boys.  Steve is described several times as ""saturnine,"" and he truly is a James Dean type.  He neither smokes nor drinks, and sees the dark side of the ""hippies"" they encounter.  (Yes, the hippies' use of cannabis was pretty open and maybe a shock to be on screen in 1965.)  But again, the hippies were also searching for something meaningful, although they almost got blown up in the war games the British Army was conducting on what they thought was an abandoned town where the hippies were squatting.

Steve gets Dinah away from the danger (of both the army and the seduction of the ""hippie"" lifestyle).  Because the Jag is blown up they are forced to hitchhike and are picked up by an older (i.e., middle-aged) upper class British couple.  Dinah asks the couple what they ""do,"" and they answer that they are collectors -- of old things.  The man echoes the movie's theme in one of his remarks, ""Young people are callously hopeful, or at least they should be.""  The older couple gives a masquerade party after ""the boys"" reunite with Steve.  By now the police are searching for the ""abducted"" Dinah at the party, where everyone is in costume.  The police announce that everyone should be on the lookout for Groucho Marx, Harpo, Charlie Chaplin, and Jean Harlow.  Is there something significant in the antiestablishment personae of these choices of characters?

""Having A Wild Weekend"" was also released as ""Catch Us If You Can.""  I think a better title might have been a quote from the film: ""Shows what happens when you take the day off work.""",1332979200,2,3855,4.601756954612006
885806,4,6304406118,"It's unfair to compare the music of the Dave Clark Five to the Beatles, of course, but when it comes to the movie itself, it's far superior to A Hard Day's Night.  Having A Wild Weekend (or Catch Us If You Can) is beautifully shot, skillfully edited, brimming with British wit, adsurdist humor, and has a real sense of integrity, even (dare I use the word?) existentialism.  I respected the ending, too, when ""Dave"" turns his back on cynical commercialism...and enjoyed the ""hip strangeness"" of the rest of the band, as actors.  I guess that, when this movie first screened, it had the unfortunate timing of going against Beatlemania at its height, and so was ignored and/or dismissed.  But having recently viewed this film, I was extremely impressed, never bored.  It has much more substance than A Hard Day's Night.  Also, the song ""Catch Us If You Can"" ain't bad either.",1331164800,2,873,4.748344370860927

It's a little dated, but a lot of fun.  Probably qualifies as a guilty pleasure.",1508025600,,248,3.7115384615384617
7872378,5,6304406118,"The Dave Clark Five's sole starring film is nothing like you would imagine, nor is it anything like its reputation as a Hard Day's Night knock-off. The latter is somewhat excusable as it was a black and white film set in England and that was enough in most Americans' minds to equate the two films, especially since very few actually saw the DC5's film. Except for the Beatles, rock and roll films in the Sixties were not box office giants. There was actually a distinguished history of British black and white films going back to the Fifties. These, called ""kitchen sink films"" and later British New Wave, were thoughtfully directed films generally about the lives of working class people in the industrial midlands and north country. It was just about this time that they began to focus more on London and the developing scene there. It's no accident that Peter Nichols, the screenwriter for this film, soon went on to write the script for Georgy Girl. This is really a British New Wave film masquerading as a rock film.

The film is also misrepresented by its main publicity photo, used for both the poster and the album cover, of a smiling Dave and a pretty blonde running down a beach with the other four band members following behind,with a postcard saying, ""Having a wild weekend."" This suggests a fun frolic with the band in Spain or some other warm place. Actually the film takes place in the dead of winter with lots of snow in some scenes. The season is fitting for the mood of the film as well: instead of the fun of A Hard Day's Night, this film is chilly and dark and Dave rarely cracks a smile. This is why the film generally gathered praise from the critics while leaving fans of the band perplexed.

This was director John Boorman's first feature length film; he would later go on to direct Deliverance, Excalibur, The Emerald Forest and Hope and Glory. His talent was evident throughout, with a very fluid camera that beautifully caught the busy urban London scene as well as providing fast-moving montages during the travel sequences. But his vision was quite dark, especially when one considers that this was the bright, optimistic mid Sixties when Britain had suddenly and surprisingly become the center of world trendiness. This is a world of crass commercialism, businesses that seem to control everything and a youth culture that seems on its way to nowhere. There's a telling scene with a band of proto-hippies who are totally burned out and incoherent. It's a film both bleak and pessimistic.

This was totally in contrast with the image of the group, a bunch of high energy loud rockers who in their trademark blazers looked like members of a British Olympic team. The Dave Clark Five were about high youthful spirits and fun. The movie begins this way with the guys living together in somewhat surreal  digs in a large church complete with a big pipe organ. The opening credits are a blast as the boys wake up, shower, dress and go for a run in the park. The mood changes gradually from that point. For one thing, they do not play themselves or even a band with a different name. They play stuntmen working on a television commercial and thus all the music is done over the action of the film and never in the usual way of them playing it on a stage. Though it seems like a group endeavor at first with all the guys having lines, the film focuses increasingly only on Dave (as Steve) and Barbara Ferris (as Dinah, and no, she is not Steve's girlfriend). Soon Denis, Lenny, Rick and even Mike (who was the girls' real favorite in the band) are pushed farther into the background until they basically are like a bunch of Keystone Cops in a car.

The acting is good all around and there is an especially memorable sequence mid-way that will have you wondering if this isn't going to turn into some kind of really creepy film. I can't say I truly love the film but have to give it five-stars because it is so offbeat and unlike anything you're expecting. On the other hand I do have to say that the band wasn't all that well-served by the movie since it went so against their usual spirit and did not feature enough of the members other than Dave. And then there's the music.

THE MUSIC: Except for the theme song, Catch Us If You Can, a major hit in the summer of '65, most of the music doesn't sound much like the Dave Clark Five. I understand this was intentional, but I don't really understand why beyond the fact that the band was not playing themselves. The singing is mostly in unison, where the DC5 style was to have Mike Smith wailing lead with a little back up by his bandmates. Denis Payton's sax played a big part in the full blast of the DC5 sound but is more recessed in the vocal numbers with Lenny's lead guitar playing a more prominent role than usual. Even the drums are not so prominent and except in occasional ballads like Because, Clark's drums were always front and center. In other words, it's a completely different sound than the group's usual.

The instrumental tracks are all over the place, too. Having a Wild Weekend is a hot, Fifties rock'n'roll instrumental with a strong sax part. Dave founded the band in 1957 (with different band mates) as an outfit that mostly played rocking instrumentals and they probably sounded like this. Dum-Dee-Dee-Dum sounds like a Duane Eddy tribute. When I'm Alone is a pure soundtrack kind of thing with piano and strings and a Henry Mancini type harmonica that couldn't have been Denis. Most interesting of all are No Stopping and On the Move. These are both pure surf instrumentals - not the all-electric kind like Pipeline, but the more predominant surf band sound that included one or even two saxophones. On the Move even includes a Dick Dale slide and comes off sounding like something by the Lively Ones. Who would have thought that the Dave Clark five could have been a hot surf band?

Having a Wild Weekend should still be of interest to Dave Clark Five Fans, fans of British New Wave or anyone interested in the oeriod. Just don't expect what you would expect.",1503014400,,6058,4.5924214417744915

7872380,3,6304406118,"For the diehard DC5 fan.  A weak plot, and boring most of the time.  Filmed in b&w, attempting to mirror The Beatles AHDN effort, but falls way short.

The bands lair is far more unrealistic than The fabs Help flat.  The hippie encounter was way out there, with their being located in an abandoned town used by the military for war games.

All in all, the movie bares many familiarities to the AHDN movie.  Fun but very dated.",1490054400,,426,4.397435897435898
7872381,4,6304406118,"Having a Wild Weekend(released April/65)star,among others,Barbara Ferris and the DC5. This was director John Boorman's first effort and the DC5's first and only full length film appearance. Like their request to do the TV show that the Monkees eventually did,they turned down any such further work, as their schedules were just too grueling.
The story finds the DC5 living together in a loft type flat. They all work as stuntmen, and a few minutes into the film we find them at a meat market filming a commercial;bemoaning the cold and the interminable wait between shots. The star of the commercials is a hand picked lass,played by Ferris. At the end of a particular shot,which calls for Ferris and Clark to drive off in an XKE Jag(love that car!),the two decide to not go back, but head off and just get away from it all.
First it's skin diving in a local pool,then  a visit to a hot house. Back at the boys flat,they throw a rave up. By now the two are being tracked by the ad agency,and they have even put a bulletin out that their starlet has been kidnapped by Dave. An ad man comes snooping around, but just misses them as they flee. Next stop is a group of abandoned houses on army property. There they run into a bunch of drugged up transients. While Ferris is curious Dave is impatient and decides to take a stroll. Just then the army comes around on maneuvers. Ferris and Dave manage to escape. Next stop is Bath(the town with the hot springs) where an older married couple offer to shelter them for a while. They are a strange pair who seem to lead separate lives,though married. The wife has designs on Dave while the hubby has the same for Ferris. Ferris and Dave keep their heads up and that night join the pair in a retro party they throw. However,by now the ad agency AND the cops have gotten their trail and they invade the party. Also the rest of the boys have joined their buddy and his girl,and they all are forced to flee into the countryside.
With a  stay on a friend of Dave's farm cut short by their pursuers,they are off and running to an island with an old casino on it .This is a place that Ferris has considered buying and re-opening. Along the way it has become apparent Ferris and Dave have had two separate goals in their journey. Dave has wanted to just escape, while Ferris admonishes him for not just enjoying the journey their lark has taken them on.
In the end, the ad agency boss is in the casino waiting for them. We learn this isn't the first time Ferris has ""run away"".The ad man walks Ferris out to greet a throng of reporters,who steps right back into her ""role"".Dave on the other hand sees the writing on the wall and joins the rest of the boys as they leave the scene.
I was at the premiere in a local Canadian theatre when this came out. I thought the plot was a bit plodding,but then I was only 12 at the time. I just sat there singing along to the music,much to the chagrin of surrounding theatre patrons! I mean just seeing my musical heroes on the big screen was such a thrill. The music was an amalgam from several albums. The US/Canada albums:Glad All Over/Bits and Pieces,American Tour/A Weekend in London,Coast to Coast/Across Canada and Having a Wild Weekend(same for both countries).Now that I'm a wee bit older I can certainly appreciate the plot a little more than I originally did;and I'm still singing along!
The acting was a bit stiff,sure,but the entire group I thought was featured well. Dave was naturally given more on screen time considering that he was the only one with any experience in that department. And look for a small blooper in the scene in the kitchen as Dave enters. The wife says""Oh,come in David"".His on screen name was ""Steve"".
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1. While it does have some artifacts,especially in the opening of the first reel,it is generally clear and crisp. This is a DVD-R made with a blue coating.
All in all a release with a lot of musical history attached. The DC5's only major film. The music is solid,and while the acting by the boys is a little stiff,and the plot somewhat helter skelter,the film is generally satisfying. It is not an Academy Award picture,but it wasn't meant to be. The DC5 ,like a few other English groups of the day,were simply being exploiting to make money. But hey,this kind of thing had been going on at least three decades before this film ever came around. 3 1/2 stars.",1488585600,,4428,4.506218905472637
