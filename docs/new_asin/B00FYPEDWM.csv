6039533,4,B00FYPEDWM,"Zombie Hamlet...

The movie starts out about a no name director/writer trying to make a movie about Shakespeare's Hamlet.
He is focused on a modern remake of an old tale with a borrowed budget of forty million dollars, but the single investor only invests a budget of twenty three million, reluctant but determined the director/writer decides to go with it.

He knows that some things will have to be cut from the film but he decides to push forward anyway.

Once the director/writer gets to the filming location, his investor pulls out of the deal abut then the director/writer gets one last break of a $300,000 investment with strings attached that are to include zombies in the film or it ends right there.

So without further hesitation & to insure the film is made the director starts to make  ""Zombie Hamlet"" a renewed modern version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet with a new title and new twist and that's where the interesting stuff begins...
In the beginning and somewhat the middle the movie lacks the good stuff, but just like life I dare you to push forward and continue to watch.

Towards the end of the film it gets interesting and you see where it is going.
You begin to enjoy it & laugh.

For those zombie genre enthusiasts I would recommend this for your zombie movie collection, what zombie collector can live without ""Zombie Hamlet""?
None!

It is a good movie, a good DVD buy and great movie to own!",1405123200,,1419,4.648
6039534,5,B00FYPEDWM,Very Funny! Interesting take on the movie within a movie. And a great cast as well! And Jason Mewes does a great job!,1400457600,,117,4.130434782608695
6039535,5,B00FYPEDWM,"This was my first ""Zombie Movie"" and I was really surprised how entertaining I found the film. The plot was somewhat predictable but always compelling and very much 21stC ""Zombie"" with an impressive soundtrack! I particuarlyl enjoyed the parody of the opening of Stanley Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"" with its haunting musical theme - very much ""Zombie"" - which features prominently early in the movie! Recommended!",1397865600,,414,5.384615384615385
6039536,5,B00FYPEDWM,Really funny. Hilarious farce. June Lockhart was hysterical. Shelly Long is a comic timing queen. Travis Wester and Vanessa Evigan are a pair I hope to see together again.,1396310400,,171,4.931034482758621

6039539,3,B00FYPEDWM,"A southern mansion becomes the setting for Hamlet--and then the producer backs out. What else to do than go cheap and make a zombie movie. Quirky and fairly funny--and enjoyable roles for June Lockhart, John Amos and Shelley Long.",1391904000,,230,4.923076923076923
6039540,5,B00FYPEDWM,"Was ridiculously funny! Something fresh for a change, had me laughing like crazy.  Big Jason Mewes fan, and loved every minute of it!  BUT my husband was NOT into it. Apparently the lack of stupid wrestling dialog, mobsters or Russian bad guys was deal breaker for him. LOL (hate his taste)",1391040000,,290,4.666666666666667
6039541,5,B00FYPEDWM,"I  Would say, it was laugh out loud slapstick comedy. Starts off Slow but makes you chuckle as you go along. I would def recommend watching this with your buddies after hanging out over a looong weekend. lol",1390003200,3,207,4.447368421052632
6039542,5,B00FYPEDWM,"If you are looking for a light hearted, slap stick comedy, then look no further.  This movie is it!  I loved the scene with John Amos telling Jason Mewes off in the car!  I had to hold my sides, I was laughing so hard.",1388448000,2,218,3.909090909090909
8619503,4,B00FYPEDWM,"My second copy. My zombie and Shakespeare loving daughter won't return my first copy so I bought another one for myself.
It's low budget, cheesey, and Vanessa Evigans legs should have gotten screen credit they were featured enough (not complaining). If you understand those things you will love it.",1518307200,,298,5.1020408163265305
8619504,4,B00FYPEDWM,i love this movie. I might donate it to the library.,1516752000,,52,3.8181818181818183
8619505,2,B00FYPEDWM,"This movie gave me a headache. The cameraman moved around too much. This movie was amateurish. Not my cup of tea. If you have vertigo, do not watch this movie. It had a great cast however, I could not watch more than ten minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. Thankfully, I bought this movie used.",1469232000,,304,4.169491525423729
8619506,3,B00FYPEDWM,"It is in a way a combination of weekend at Bernie's and a documentary on how bad movies get made. My wish was that this was a real Zombie movie because I like bad movies. So bad they are good sort of thing. This one wasn't that bad so it wasn't that good either, although it had some cute moments.",1459209600,,297,3.966666666666667
8619507,4,B00FYPEDWM,"As impressive as massive Hollywood blockbusters can be to watch, I sometimes enjoy watching low-budget pictures just as much. Theres a lot of bad low-budget films out there, but theres also a lot of fun movies that often get overlooked. ZOMBIE HAMLET is one such movie.

The movie falls into the mockumentary genre and is basically a behind the scenes look at director Osric Taylors (Travis Wester) desire to bring his vision for a Civil War-based Hamlet to life on film. However, in order to get the funding he needs to finish the movie, he takes some financing from southern matron Hester Beauchamps (June Lockhart) who only agrees to finance the film if he agrees to throw some zombies into the mix. Things go crazy when Hester dies in mid-shoot without having cashed the final check for the film. Its a mad dash to get the money and to finish the film before people find out Hester is dead.

I really enjoyed ZOMBIE HAMLET. The movie was a little different than what I thought it would be. However, its really quite funny. It does a good job of parodying independent film-making. Theres some pretty good acting (particularly June Lockahrt, Jason Mewes, and John Amos) and the story is relatively fresh. Personally, what I enjoyed most about the movie is that it doesnt take itself too seriously. Its the type of movie thats not only fun to watch, but you also get the impression that it must have been a fun movie to make, too. Overall, ZOMBIE HAMLET isn't a masterpiece, but for a low-budget film that parodies low-budget film making, its a fun romp through Shakespeare and the American South.",1436486400,,1598,4.703571428571428
8619508,5,B00FYPEDWM,"What a hoot this movie is. Osric Taylor ( played by the wonderful Travis Wester) is finally getting his wish to direct a movie of Shakespeare's Hamlet. His producer gets him to Hollywood and they agree to 2.4 million to make the movie, as he gets to the location in Louisiana, Hollywood pulls the money, Osric gets a little old lady (June Lockhart) to fund the film which has now become a movie of Hamlet set in the Civil War with zombies. I have to tell you that I laughed out loud often. so much fun and I wish I were part of the cast.....they look like they had a blast. Jason Mewes, Shelley Long, Vanessa Evigan and john Amos, too. This isn't a zombie movie, it is about making a zombie movie.",1432080000,,697,4.2481203007518795
