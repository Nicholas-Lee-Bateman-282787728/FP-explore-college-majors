8453215,5,B0051SMBIA,"This show is one of my favorites, the track list is perfect, with spectacular performances of rarely performed songs, ie: Will, SCAR, End of the World, In the Corner, etc. Because it's a Premium CDL, you get the benefit of it spanning her career to that point, it's not just for one album. So yes, with amazing performances of many different eras, fun stage banter, the members of her troupe who have now left such as Gomi, Enrique and Maro are all there still for over 2 hours of concert awesomeness, on blu-ray, this show is worth every penny.",1453248000,,545,4.515151515151516
