8280013,4,B00008G7IY,"OK i had to write this cuz the other review isn't helpful enough. This is a pretty decent show. I'm goin to rate these matches out of 5.

Psicosis vs. La Parka
For a ""bonus match"" this was really good match, sort of a walk down memory lane from WCW. The match goes back and forth and no reason it should be in the ""bonus match"" part of the DVD. (4/5)

Mexico's Most Wanted vs. Venom Black & Xtasis
Another pretty decent match showing off a lot of lucha action and is a preliminary match for the tag team tournament. Lots of high flying and its always a good match with Halloween and Damien 666. (4/5)

G.Q. Money and Veronica Caine vs. Angel and Lizzy Borden
Its a raw sewage match which theres no reason for it but an ok match with some interference from Steve Rizzono and Kaos and a huge bump with G.Q. and Angel goin threw a few tables and a kiddy pool full of crap water, thats right CRAP WATER!!! (3/5)

Shady and American Wild Child vs. The Alter Boys
This match is the only one on this DVD that i just can't stand. Honestly i skip it every time cuz in my opinion it sux not worth anyones time even mine to watch so i can review it on here. (1/5) and that rating is generous

Kaos vs. Chris Hamrich for the XPW T.V. Title
Another decent match in the feud of these 2 where the brawling goes all over the place. (3.5/5)

Webb vs. Terry Funk for the XPW Heavyweight Title
This is the match that makes up for the lack of violence on the DVD. Barbed wire, thumbtacks, and the infamous double cross branding iron is used. Good title match worth watching. (3.5/5)

Now here is the problem with this DVD. And yes as im sitting here writing this i found out there were 4 other matches not even put on the DVD!!!! whats wrong with the people that make these DVD's that they can't even put all their matches on there if anything make them 2 discs i'd still buy them. I say that cuz Baptized in Blood 3 is missing 2 matches which is the reason i haven't bought that show yet. Well anyway besides just finding that out this is still a pretty decent show wish they could've put the others on but oh well all in all i give this show 4 stars cuz it really is underrated.",1287619200,,2160,4.140811455847255
