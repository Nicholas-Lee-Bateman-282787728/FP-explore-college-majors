What you get is an ongoing account of the continuing eruption of Kilauea volcano with excellent historical footage as well as recent eruption coverage. I go to Hawaii every year and own land in the Volcano village area so this is always a favorite DVD of mine. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in volcanoes, etc.",1180915200,2,420,4.613333333333333

8108012,5,B000EAVAV4,"Eruption Update 2003 (DVD Format) is actually three features on one DVD. The first feature ""2003 Eruption Update"" presents the exciting account of the twenty-year eruptive history of the Kilauea volcano. You learn of the various eruptive styles, witness the formation of amazing structures and lava outpourings, and observe the impact on human lives. The work conducted in the study of the multiple eruptive events by volcanologists at the Hawaiian Volcanic Observatory is interwoven throughout the story. One often forgets the danger that these scientists place themselves in in the necessary study of the Hawaiian volcanoes. The next feature is titled ""Reflections on Kilauea."" This segment provides a nice companion to the proceeding feature as you see and hear from folks who have been studying the Kilauea eruption since 1983. You learn of the personal impact that this long-standing eruption has had on various lives. The third feature is a light-hearted video showing how the ongoing erutions of the Kilauea volcano occasionally impact its scientific investigation. This feature proves yet again that the best science comes at a cost - thank goodness the equipment was ""borrowed."" I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the history of the Kilauea eruption. It makes a great teaching tool as the features provide students with the sights and sounds of many small and large scale Hawaiian-style eruptions. Three features on one DVD make it an outstanding value and an excellent contribution to the volcanology of the Hawaiian Islands.",1064793600,9,1552,5.313008130081301
