8428370,5,B004FV55YQ,"After doing different pilates and more intense yoga work during the week, I love doing this one at the end of the week (or sometimes in the beginning to get going). Very easy to follow, relaxing and my hips and legs feel wonderful when I'm done. The voice work is calm, not annoying and gently walks you through the practice. A keeper!",1377216000,,335,4.419354838709677
8428371,5,B004FV55YQ,I very much enjoyed Chillax flow. It's a great hip opening flow. You feel very calm and peaceful when you're done. I like to save it for the end of the work week.,1361059200,,162,3.9393939393939394
8428372,5,B004FV55YQ,"Though you won't find a ocean vista or a rainforest in this video, you will find an amazing Chillaxing yoga workout. Taught by a truly inspiring teacher. (And if you can take a class with her you definitely should too!) Although it does make you miss her teaching in person if you've ever experienced her instruction. It's almost like she's there with you but of course she's only inside your TV (darn) still her instructions are poetic and clear and her vinyasa is creative and rejuvenating. She has an amazing sense of humor too. But this DVD this is some serious Yoga! Quite enjoyable. Don't just watch it, get up and do it and you'll be glad you did. Liked her other video a whole heck of a lot too!! Wonderful wonderful Lisa Richards is the yoga bomb!",1292803200,2,756,4.4855072463768115
