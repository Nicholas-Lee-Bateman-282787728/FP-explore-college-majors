8471965,5,B005GP881W,"Big fan of steve's workouts and fitness philosophy. This probably my favorite workout of his and a good compliment for folks training jiu jitsu, with strength endurance and mobility to help with recovery.

A few pointers, you will need kettlebells, pull-up bar and rings, as well as an indian club. Plus this video sold by amazon can only be viewed online and not downloaded, which I wasn't aware of at the time of purchase. Exercises can be adapted if you do not have all of the exercise equipment outlined above as well. All of that aside it is definitely worth the purchase.",1464566400,,577,4.6568627450980395
8471966,5,B005GP881W,Probably Steve's best workout so far. This workout is definitely NOT for beginners... It's a real beast!,1411689600,,104,5.176470588235294
8471967,1,B005GP881W,This just wasn't the video for me. It almost appeared as if it were filmed in some random guy's garage. May be just a difference in preference. I am accustomed to the instructor having a better film presence and I like a bit of motivational encouragement without being too chipper. I was able to find many videos similar to this for free on YouTube and regret paying the the price I paid for this one. There are better out there for half the price. The workout itself seems effective and may be better suited for a no nonsense male who just needs technical guidance and nothing else.,1391990400,2,583,4.457943925233645
8471968,5,B005GP881W,I have a number of Steve's workout DVDs and I like them all. The Spartacus workout presents a wide variety of exercises so you get a good workout for all your different muscle groups.,1372118400,3,183,4.411764705882353
8471969,4,B005GP881W,"Not for beginners or intermediates is an understatement. Steve starts off the 45 minute workout with some light L-seat pull ups, and by the time he gets to the turkish getups with two kettlebells, he's long since left the amateur garage gorilla in the dust. I bought the video just to see what the advanced work out that he warned about was, and got humbled after the first circuit/set. The man, Maxwell, is truly amazing.",1369267200,11,422,4.64
