1625649,4,B00005MKL4,"I found this program to be very interesting. Done in the style of Walking with Dinosaurs the viewer is provided with a fascinating glimpse at what the American Dinosaur world must have been like in various regions and periods millions of years ago. Most of the scenes were done very well, you could almost believe that you were actually there. On the Discovery Channel showing I noticed that the scene where the fallen Apatosaurus is killed and eaten was toned down in violence and blood, and in the Stegosaurus mating scene the camera moved at the critical point, probably for sensitive viewers such as children. This program is worth owning.",995155200,5,643,4.8545454545454545
1625650,5,B00005MKL4,"i enjoyed this DVD very much.  i have been watching dinosaur productions over forty years now and i find that this new batch is absolutely amazing.  had they been around when i was a kid i most likely would have become a paleontologist.

the CG is good, but there are some scenes that children under 6 or 8 may find scary.",1174694400,,322,4.245901639344262
1625651,5,B00005MKL4,"I thought this was better than Walking With Dinosaurs for the following reasons: 1: All CG Dinos of reasonable quality as opposed to fantastic CG dinos and TERRIBLE hand puppets, 2: Animals behave more naturally, more believable, 3: REALLY nice extinction sequence as opposes to just glossing over it, 4: Portraying the animals as SUCCESSFUL as opposed to failures. 5: Claws and talons are SHARP as opposed to blunt.

  However, the CG dinos are clearly that - CG, but their attributes (acting, voices, etc) make up for it. Also, in WWD, some of the animals (T-rex especially) did not match up with skeletal data (if you put WWD dino and skeleton next to each other they would not match), but in WDRA, the dinos did. I did like Goodman's narration more than Branaugh. WWD is much more Brittish in style (laid back, ""proper"", etc) than this (you see more gore/blood, ASTEROID IMPACT!). This and WWD allows the viewer to critically asses what data contradicts the other and make their own vision of Prehistoric Life. Which is the whole point.",1144540800,3,1040,4.798882681564246
1625652,3,B00005MKL4,"The subject of this program is a shallow survey of the great age of dinosaurs in North America. It begins with the Triassic and proceeds through the Cretaceous and a few types are examined in each period. Nothing is presented with much depth and the narration is the type expected of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. You merely follow the critters around and see what they are doing.

Compared to the state of the art when I was a kid, the dinosaurs depicted in this program are a miracle. Compared to recent programs, however, they are somewhat lacking. This is not the high budget animation of Jurassic Park or some of the higher end documentaries but it is still a miracle compared to the Claymation things I saw as a kid. Along with the quality of the animation, I had a few problems with some of the depictions of the creatures themselves. Late in the Cretaceous, some are shown with primordial feathers. That makes sense but the furry looking dinosaurs from early in the Cretaceous do not. Hair is a trait of mammals, not raptors. Furry raptors indeed!

The narration is provided by John Goodman whose voice was pleasant in that role. Unfortunately, his script was rather inane and rarely added anything worthwhile to the program. Most of the statements presented as wonderful revelations are merely common sense. ""Plant eating dinosaurs have learned to get along with their environment by eating plants."" One would suppose that meat eating dinosaurs learned to get along with their environment by eating meat.

It may seem that I have panned this program but that is not my intention. It is shallow compared to many others and the presentation was lacking but that did not detract from the wonder of seeing the dinosaurs roam the earth. To me, it was worth it.",1141171200,3,1766,4.745928338762215
1625653,3,B00005MKL4,"My 3 yr old son is obsessed with dinosaurs and does love to watch this show repeatedly.  While the graphics are pretty good, John Goodman's narration really does not add to the show, but rather detracts from it, in my opinion.  He sounds like he's just dry reading off of cue cards and like he has no interest whatsoever in what he's narrating.  A good narrator can make a soup can label sound interesting.  Goodman also mispronounces the name of the hadrosaurs they talk about in the last quarter of the program.  They are anatotitans and he calls them ananatotitans.  He says the name quite a few times, I'm surprised the producers didn't make him correct the mispronunciation being as it's pushed as an educational program.  It's really not hard to say it correctly.

I'd have to say the poor narration would probably be off putting for older kids and adults, but young children don't pay much attention to it, they are more interested in the visuals, so the poor narration likely would not bother them.",1140998400,,1006,4.676136363636363
1625654,5,B00005MKL4,"The price, for the length and quality of the dvd is wonderful.  I would recommend this dvd to anybody who wants something acurate and realistic.  I was totally sucked into this, even though I bought it for my four year old.  He was totally sucked in too!",1115596800,6,254,4.361702127659575
1625655,3,B00005MKL4,"It is difficult to grade this 90 minute film without mentioning Walking With Dinosaurs which was fantastic (5 star effort) and runs along a comparable story line.  When Dinosaurs Roamed America was clearly done with a tight budget in mind -- the graphics are clearly (or rather unclearly) computer generated, often awkward and not persuasively ""real"".  The raptors however are done well and the overall story lines seem reasonably thought out and logical for the viewer.  I dislike the moderator John Goodman who brings a Roseann-type blue collar ""image"" to the viewer.  Almost anyone else would have been much better.  Overall, I think the product was not intended to be bought for a collector's shelf.  It is akin quality wise to a made-for-tv movie, intended to be watched once, and only once.  A bland, average product far inferior to the ""Walking With"" series.",1080086400,4,865,5.006993006993007
1625656,4,B00005MKL4,"When Dinosaurs Roamed America is a movie similar to ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", it shows dinosaurs made with computer animation in a documentary style (like nature shows). Since both movies are similar, a fair comparison can be made. The computer animation is excellent just as in WWD. The music is average classical stlye, but not as good as WWD. The narrator in this movie is, Mr. John Goodman, who did a pretty good job, but does not match the excellent narration of the one in WWD. A few other things kind falters in this movie, ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"": it's very short, it has similar scenes to WWD, they even took similar narration lines. Overall it's a very good movie but lacks the poetic beauty of Walking with Dinosaurs DVD, but it's still a good purchase.",1076198400,,772,4.725925925925926
1625667,4,B00005MKL4,"I got this video for my son when he was 3 and started really getting into dinosaurs. He's probably watched it 50 times and is still engrossed every time. I like that it not only shows the computer animated dinosaurs with narratives, but features many of today's experts on this topic sharing their thoughts. It's also helped both of us learn the pronunciations of the longer dinosaur names. Though not perfect, I'd much rather my kids watch reality-based programming like this than that ridiculous Land Before Time series. (Believe me, you can tell which kids watch the fluff and which ones watch documentaries.)",1067904000,5,612,4.951456310679611
1625668,1,B00005MKL4,"I watched the first 20 minutes before I turned this sorry excuse for a Walking With Dinosaurs imitation off. It is neither educational nor entertaining. For example, a bunch of furry turkeys (they called them raptors) had brought down a segnosaur when all of a sudden, a fire starts in the woods. The raptors continue eating until they relize they are on FIRE and they drop dead. Animals instinctively run from woodsmoke. Let that be a lesson to you: John Goodman (who played Fred Flinstone in the equally educational Flinstones movie)+ dinosaur documentary = something not fit even fit for basic cable.",1027036800,7,603,4.921568627450981
1625669,3,B00005MKL4,"... it is nearly impossible to look at this feature, without comparing its quality to that of 'Walking with Dinosaurs'.  It is very similar in style, delivered like a modern-day wildlife documentary, but it jumps around a lot.  The CG graphics and animation are not quite of the same calibur of WWD, as well.  Very rarely did the creatures seem to interact with their real-life environment.  They often looked like they were just dropped into it, or stuck on like those old colorforms decals on a cardboard background.  Where the lack of detail was most obvious is when the dinosaurs eat.  The plant-eaters were the most awkward to watch, mainly because of the same lack of interatction with the environment.  The meat eaters rarely had any flesh in their mouths.  To see the animals 'chewing' and making other eating movements, but not actually be *eating* anything made it look silly and almost unprofessional.
But this DVD isn't all bad.  It was well paced and still interesting.  Some of the interpretations of the dinosaurs themselves were good.  T-Rex as a family pack hunter?  Interesting.  Some of the designs for the dinosaurs were quite cool too.  Some of them looked a little cartoonish for my tastes, but I have to admit that the feathered dinosaurs were well done.
Certainly, it isn't nearly as impressive as Walking With Dinosaurs, but it also isn't as expensive as Walking With Dinosaurs.  It is a good watch for the price.",1021852800,4,1438,4.836065573770492
1625670,5,B00005MKL4,"One can only imagine what it must have been like to
roam the wilderness and countryside and try and place
yourself in the same landscapes with dinosaurs walking
around.
This is must see for all interested dinosaurs to view.
My 5 year old grandson, who knows the name of about 30
different dinosaurs, sits in AWE (along with me) over the
size of animals that very well could have shared the same
ground we walk on today.
Excellent film.",1015027200,2,435,4.518987341772152
1625671,3,B00005MKL4,"I'd love to be writing a gushing review about this DVD.  I was certainly looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, it suffers on two fronts.  First, the CGI is at least a generation behind that shown in Walking With Dinosaurs.  The character models are stiffer, less detailed, and show none of the realistic motion of skin and muscle that made the WWD animation so lifelike.
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, this presentation has been considerably ""dumbed down"" -- even at the risk of making the science fuzzy and inaccurate.  If you've seen the Discovery Channel presentation of Walking With Dinosaurs vs. the DVD, you'll know just how horrid a job was done in the editing room when moving the presentation to Discovery.  This DVD shows the same dead hand at the switch.  It displays no faith in the viewers to do more than watch the pretty pictures.
Certainly better than anything we would have seen ten years ago, but not as good as what can be done today.  It simply lacks the loving care and interest in the subject shown by the WWD specials.",1008028800,12,1051,4.704918032786885
1625672,3,B00005MKL4,"Five years ago, I probably would have given When Dinosaurs Roamed America a rave review. It is a good dinosaur special, well done overall and with interesting effects. But in the post-Walking with Dinosaurs era, it's a bit of a letdown. The animation is not as good, nor is the writing as sharp.

One other note: John Goodman is really not up the level of either Kenneth Branaugh (British version of Walking with Dinosaurs as well as the DVD version) or Avery Brooks (the version of Walking With Dinosaurs shown on the Discovery Channel). The latter two treat it as a serious nature special. Goodman's narration makes it sound like he's narrating a children's TV special, not a nature special.",1001289600,15,693,4.775
1625673,4,B00005MKL4,"I absolutely loved ""Walking With Dinosaurs.""  While this DVD isn't as good as that set it still is a great DVD.  It has a very similar feel (like a Natural Geographic Special).  The graphics are excellent but not as good as WWD.  In some areas you can find imperfections.  I like that they found some really interesting new locations; new woods that look like they were in the dinosaur times.
The naration is one of the bigger detractors from the film.  John Goodman?  Come on?  Why?  Because he was in the Flinstones?  Not even close to the standard set in WWD.
There was some re-use of backgrounds and animations of some scenes which made me say, ""hey, I saw that already, all they did was mirror the scene.""
The pacing was perfect and the few but insightful palentologist comments were well done.  The length was good.  Another good thing was that there were some new dinosaurs in this DVD that we haven't previously seen.
Overall, the DVD is great, offered new info, showed dinos with feathers, and continued the trend started by WWD.  I highly recommend it for any audience.  Also the price is right.",998265600,7,1105,4.6

7945602,5,B00005MKL4,"Anyone who is interested in nature, this is a must!  This DVD takes you from the Late Triassic to the Late Cretaceous.  These are the dinosaurs, or animals, that you will see as you watch:
LATE TRIASSIC
Coelophysis
Rutiodon
Desmatosuchus
Icarosaurus
Traversodon
Mammal (live-acted by an Eastern Quoll)
Locust
EARLY JURASSIC
""Syntarsus""
Anchisaurus
Dilophosaurus
LATE JURASSIC
Ceratosaurus
Allosaurus
Apatosaurus
Dryosaurus
Stegosaurus
Camarasaurus
Pterosaur
MID-CRETACEOUS
Unidentified dromaeosaur
Nothronychus
Zuniceratops
Coelurosaur
LATE CRETACEOUS
Tyrannosaurus
Triceratops

Edmontosaurus (identified as its synonym Anatotitan)
Quetzalcoatlus
Purgatorius (live-acted by opossums)
Turtle (live acted)

Spider (live acted)

It is especially nice to see dinosaurs like Apatosaurus.  These sauropods grew to 70 feet long, and stood 30 feet high!  Ceratosaurus, a carnivore, was 17 feet long and about 8 feet tall.  It is also nice to see Triceratops on the DVD; that is one of my favorite dinosaurs.  And Dilophosaurus, no less--this DVD shows you the true nature of that dinosaur (it, naturally, did NOT spit poison at its prey)!

This is definitely a MUST for those who like dinosaurs!",1426982400,,1254,5.889502762430939

7945606,4,B00005MKL4,"Even among admirers of ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"" (hereafter WDRA), there is a reluctant admission that this BBC-production prehistoric animal follow-up is not quite up to the lofty standard of its predecessor, the destined-to-be-a-classic ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".  Some disapprove of the somewhat less-than-convincing CGI of animal movements and interactions.  Others disapprove of narrator John Goodman's somewhat irreverent and less-authoritative tone.  Still others may get antsy with the interspersed interruptions of paleontologists talking about the fossils and bones that inspired the CGI recreations.  I concede that these fault findings are not without some validity.

However, I was still impressed with the somewhat second-tier WDRA.  WDRA at least matches the ""Walking..."" series with the broad scope of its analysis of prehistoric creatures and its resistance to ""getting on with it"" and showing us the dinosaurs already.  WDRA is chronologically episodic like ""Walking..."" but the episodes segue and blend into each other better, even when they use the paleontologists as transition.  Each episode displays a part of Modern America (New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota), then dissolves into a prehistoric past that shows the environment and creatures at the time.  WDRA begins with the Permian period and ends with the Cretaceous period.  We work our way from non-dinosaurs like the crocodile-like Rutiodon and Desmatosuchus, through early dinosaurs like Coelophysis, Anchisaurus, Syntarsus, and Dilophosaurus, through feathered raptors like Velociraptor and ceratopsian ancestors like Zuniceratops, to the freakish therizinosaur Nothronykus, to finally the dinosaurs we know and love (Stegosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Apatosaurus, Triceratops, and the ubiquitous Tyrannosaurus).  I'm sure I missed a few, but you get the point that you get your money's worth creature-wise.  Furthermore, each creature gets a satisfactory profile of its physiology and probable lifestyle.

Now, I tend to agree that the CGI depictions are somewhat inferior.  The ""Walking..."" series has spoiled us.  We have become amateur CGI experts, looking to see if the CGI animal raises dust, or splashes, or leaves footprints, or disturbs foliage.  Sometimes the animals fail to do those things in WDRA, but not all that often.  As for the animal movements, you could say they were too fluid, too swift, too light and airy.  I'm reminded of the multi-ton T-Rex's swift pursuit of the hadrosaur.  However, again, those unnatural, gravity-free movements were rare and didn't bother me all that much.  All the CGI creatures had enough verisimilitude (i.e., appearance of life) to make me happy.

As for John Goodman, he is a fine actor with a deep, sonorous voice.  I liked his booming but measured narration that fills us in on prehistoric animal lore.  Perhaps Goodman's voice lacks, say, Kenneth Branagh's sobriety and solemnity, but it is not in any way faint or mocking.  He may make a wry observation now and again (e.g. when he states that Quetzalcoatulus is ""hamburger"" for the young T-Rex) but it is not insulting or non-professional.  On the contrary, Goodman's narration quite amply and adeptly delivers the goods.

Moving on to the paleontological intermissions, yeah, they do take you out of the prehistoric dimension.  Nevertheless, they give the viewer solid, fossilized evidence as to how a prehistoric animal looked, moved, and lived (enlived by 3-D computer graphics).  In other words, the CGI animal depictions are not pure speculation, but based on the latest, up-to-date information.  The intermissions, though educational, are not too lengthy and tedious, and prepare the reader for the next episode.

The final bottom line, I guess, is if you liked the ""Walking.."" series, or enjoy learning about animals, past or present, AND you're not too nitpicky or fussy, you'll enjoy WDRA's journey across an America that now only exists in our imagination.",1337904000,,3999,5.551155115511551
