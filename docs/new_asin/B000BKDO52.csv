I try to absorb during my exercises knowledge on different subjects, but unfortunately not all the documentaries are informative. Many of them are kind of chicken sup, readers digest, gossip stuff and based on amazons revues it is rather hard to decide what is what kind. As to NOVA and most of the BBC DVDs' mostly i  was satisfied.",1202515200,,385,4.661764705882353

8087793,5,B000BKDO52,"We don't have cable(not worth it) so PBS is one of the only channels we get . Our children(ages 10,8 and 2) have grown up loving NOVA(and all other PBS science shows).This set would make a magnificent gift. Note I say GIFT,because at this price(even with the discount)I would never buy it. Lucky for us we were able to tape the whole 2005 season as we watched it . HOORAY FOR NOVA!!!!!!!!!! It was a GREAT season.",1134172800,,413,4.376623376623376
