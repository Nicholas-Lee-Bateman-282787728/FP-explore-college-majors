6463877,5,B00L2YY09U,"This is an excellent re-issue of season one, with the full length approximately 25 minute episodes.  Non of those short edited 22 minute episodes here. This is awesome.  Good bonus features, too.",1414886400,11,195,5.0625
6463878,5,B00L2YY09U,"I understand these episodes have been on DVD before but this release is a much nicer package both physically and creatively. Of course there are the 30+ original episodes that first aired in 1958-1959 but there is also a new half-hour interview with series star Shelley Fabares, who played daughter Mary on The Donna Reed Show, and she provides thoughtful, loving insights into the
show and the real life relationships between the actors who became a family off the set too.",1412640000,12,474,4.864197530864198
6463879,3,B00L2YY09U,"With a heavy heart, I come bearing sad news.  MPI's release of The Donna Reed Show: Season 1 was supposed to be an upgrade to Arts Alliance America/Virgil Film's out of print release...  And, in many ways it is!  So, let's start with the good news:

MPI gives us this release spread across 5 discs, as opposed to Arts Alliance's which used only 4.  Packaging is the same as with MPI's releases for
Seasons 4 & 5, featuring similar artwork and a single width, clear multi-disc amaray case.  Episodes 1-10 are presented with the first version of the opening and ending credits/theme song variant and episodes 11-37 with the second variant.  Though these are very similar, they are nonetheless distinctly different.  Unlike the Arts Alliance set, all 37 episodes presented here contain the full ending theme/credits, featuring a seamlessly recreated fade to the Screen Gems logo.  This ensures that the end theme doesn't come to an abrupt and jolting stop.  Episode 3, The Hike, contains the original sponsor opening, commercials and end credits, including both the original Screen Gems and ABC Network logos.  All of this is much appreciated, as are the special features.  For this release, MPI gives us some truly great special features!  The highlights include a new half hour featurette entitled ""Recollections by Shelley Fabares"" and a full episode (including commercials) of This Is Your Life with a very surprised Donna Reed as the guest of honor.  The other features are: Original Sponsor Opening & Closing Billboards (these are the same as those included on Episode 3) and an Original ABC Network Promo.

Now, for the unfortunate bad news: Somehow (and honestly I have no clue how this could have possibly happened) two episodes are presented in their ""edited for syndication"" 22 minute versions.  The episodes that share this fate are Episode 8 ""Change Partners & Dance"" and, my personal favorite, Episode 25 ""The Ideal Wife"".  These episodes appear on discs 1 and 4 respectively.  Now, as MPI is one of the best and most thorough ""Classic TV on DVD"" producers, this comes as a complete and total shock.  Especially since the back cover clearly states that ""The Donna Reed Show Season 1 includes all 37 episodes complete and digitally remastered.""  All I can hope is that either replacement discs will be issued OR that these 2 episodes can be included as bonus features on a hopefully subsequent Season 2 release.

This oversight is the sole reason for my 3 star rating for an otherwise outstanding release.  If this issue is addressed and remedied by MPI, I will update my review with the outcome.",1411948800,36,2606,4.91533180778032

What a fun show--and it has lots of extras as well, such as Donna Reed on ""This is your life"", interviews with her co-stars, original commercials.

6463894,5,B00L2YY09U,"I use an antenna (rather than cable television), and we started getting a station called ""ME"" (memorable entertainment).  The Donna Reed Show was on for a while at 7:00 a.m.  I have no idea why, at 50 years old, I enjoy these old perfect-family shows from the 1950s.  There was a time when a show like this was considered to set an unrealistic standard for American family life in all of its variety.  Now, it's clear that the show isn't reality and that it perhaps never was an accurate picture of the world, even in 1950.  It's clearly just classic television and, in that sense, it's a great escape to a time (whether real or not) when life was simple and people were generally happy.",1434758400,11,687,4.464
