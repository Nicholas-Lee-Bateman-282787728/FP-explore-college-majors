8368666,5,B002EXJ3IG,I love this video from Michael Jackson . I think this video is one of his best videos that he has done . But I think 99$ is way to much for 1 DVD,1461974400,,145,3.2941176470588234
8368667,1,B002EXJ3IG,"I tried to watch this video multiple times, but it skipped/stuttered throughout the film. It was agonizing. Contacted the seller multiple times and never heard back. Now it's unavailable. Hmpf.",1291593600,2,193,5.466666666666667
8368668,1,B002EXJ3IG,I never received this item.. the seller never sent it so I can't rate the item. but I know it is very good the item that is. I was very disappointed that I didn't get it.,1283299200,,170,3.75
8368669,5,B002EXJ3IG,"This short film is nothing short of brilliant.  The mix of story line and music and dancing truly showcase MJ's talents.  He wanted to do film more and if this was just a sample of what he was capable of he would have excelled at that as well.  The copy I got does freeze after about 20-25 minutes and I can't watch the ""making of"" without it freezing either.  I'm trying to resolve that with the seller but short of that issue this is really a special piece of MJ's work to own.  I had never heard of it before and once I started looking for it and found it I knew I had to have it.  Brilliant special effects and acting.  The music and dancing showcase MJ's talent well.  RIP MJ",1275696000,3,680,4.098484848484849

8368671,5,B002EXJ3IG,"I think this is one of the best Michael Jackson films I've ever seen! I love the part where Michael dances as a skeleton! I have one of the first few dvd copies of it that were here on amazon. The disc seems to be in good condition with no scratches on it, but the last 12 minutes keep freezing and stopping. I REALLY do hope the Michael Jackson company plan to make more dvd copies of this film now that Michael is gone, because surprisenly since his death, the film MOONWALKER released on vhs in 1988 is right now being released on dvd formate for the very first time!! Anyway, I do hope they'll make more dvd's of this film and I hope amazon gets them soon! I would like to get one that's in the best condition and dosen't freeze.",1267228800,4,733,4.169014084507042
8368672,5,B002EXJ3IG,"How prescient the title of this 40-ish minute film. Made in 1997, it reveals some of the pain Michael Jackson must have experienced. This gives a bite to the astounding creativity. In addition, and not too long ago, we lost the film's director, the gifted makeup and effects artist, Stan Winston.

Soaring over the loss and the revelation of Mr. Jackson's inner turmoil as accusations of terrible crimes swirled around him, we have  in ""Ghosts"" a high level of filmic and choreographic achievement. The makeup work, as one would expect coming out of Stan Winston Studios, will floor you. Don't miss the closing credits. The visual effects rise, at times, to the level of mind-blowing, and in keeping with the challenging emotional tone of the film, alternate between dark humor and a savage, and understandable anger that MJ was loath to express directly in public.

""The Maestro"" and his powers reveal once again the childlike innocence and untrammeled creativity that Mr. Jackson brought to every film project. We see clearly the outraged innocent, the martyr, and the narcissist/fantasist. Here is a genius-child with the intellect, the tools and talent an industry could provide, living out a fantasy that is so personal as to be, at times, terribly touching. It's necessary to put that to one side and accept this little-known legacy of two great artists, whose work will be sorely missed and will influence other artists for some time to come.",1262995200,12,1449,5.004149377593361
8368673,5,B002EXJ3IG,"This is what Michael wanted to do, tell stories, make short films that's an escape for the audience, from their everyday life, even if just for a little while. And he did.
This was more indepth that just a music video. With a story line already in progress this movie pulls you into the plot more, makes you want to sit and watch whats comming next, MJ keeps you interested with this scary/ but not too scary film called GHOSTS. Michael's Acting is A plus, how did he get so good. GHOSTS tells the story of magician like character living suposedly on his own that likes to play tricks and amuse the kids, but a mob of towns people find it strange, and want him out. This was very entertaing, with music to thinken the plot, and his inovative dance moves were like noting we've seen before. As always MJ reinvents new moves with evey new show. The plot makes you think, with an underlying theme of how he see's the public viewing him, I felt that I understood him alot more than in the past. And he does hurt when people say things that aren't true. the matireal of the songs are so true to life it's ""scary for ya baby"" I love that it also comes with the making of the movie, thats like an added bonus to an already cool film. This has it all, skillful dancing, top vocals, new film technology and special effects.

Excellent Film, I just wish he did more films.
Starring Michael Jackson and Mos Deff.
I liked the music from this film so much, that I also bought the CD with the top 3 songs from the movie in it, Ghosts, 2Bad, and Is it scary. Listen to the words,it's profound.",1257465600,22,1578,4.277591973244147
8368674,5,B002EXJ3IG,"I was not sure what I would find with this DVD, I had never heard of it before...  but I was looking for someting fun for Halloween...  how exciting to find this DVD...  It is well produced, and the DVD is of excellent quality... Michael Jackson plays a few characters in Ghost and we were amazed to find out after the program finished...so much so that we watched it again just so we could try and catch each of his disguises",1256342400,15,426,4.234567901234568
8368675,5,B002EXJ3IG,"I just had a chance to view this wonderful film on cable tv, and thought I would like to purchase a copy of the dvd. Unfortunately, it is not available to US customers in an all-region format. This is really too bad, as I found the film a strong statement on the problems of illegal workers who are caught in abusive and manipulative situations.

Bring this out on an all-region format, please!",1255996800,,394,4.472222222222222
