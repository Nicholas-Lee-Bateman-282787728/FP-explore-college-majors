1389722,5,B000053GSK,this movie and it's sequel were both very good. of course they're predictable but they're great.,1060041600,,96,5.0625
1389723,4,B000053GSK,I found this Film to Be a nice film that was touching&made a warm message&Presentation.very enjoyable& it had works.,1047600000,,116,5.157894736842105
1389724,5,B000053GSK,"A fantastic, wonderful story involving feelings and attitudes. Virtues from honesty to courage to perseverance are personified, rather than preached. The characters play the story straight instead of wholesale slapstick. Sends a clear message of acceptance. It won the kids over, every one. They definitely would watch again. ""Funny, crazy, exciting, terrific. Hilarious in places."" Portrayal of hearing-impaired sister impressed them. ""Even if you are different you can still do things."" ""I want to learn sign language."" Best for ages 8 to 12.",1000684800,,544,5.566265060240964
1389725,5,B000053GSK,"I thought this movie was soo good!  It's really hard to find movies that don't ahve alot of junk in them, but this one doesn't!  I really like it that there are actually 3 stories in one.  One is about Jack, the other one is about the hockey team, and the other one is about Tara.  With the other parts, this movie is good for people who aren't sports fans too.  I love it!",999734400,,373,3.9864864864864864
1389726,3,B000053GSK,"I found this movie rather so so. Some of the scenes were quite touching, but some of the events in the movie were just too improbable. The refs disallowed the first goal by the chimp because he was an ineligible player, why did they not disallow a later goal for the same reason? I thought the movie tastefully done on the whole, but too many little things rather spoiled the whole effect. How many households are in the habit of storing ceral under the kitchen sink? Just one of the many points where I had to sigh and shake my had. Still, not a total loss. I had the opportunity to see one of the chimps at a hockey game, and it is impressive how it could skate and shoot a puck. Some of the scenes are clearly borrowed from other films, and if one could ignore the more questionable points, still manage to derive some enjoyment from this work. Just be prepared to take certain things with a grain of salt.",991008000,,909,4.290697674418604
1389727,4,B000053GSK,"I'll admit - I usually avoid any film that stars a monkey. I find them intensely dull and corny. But I'm a big Kevin Zegers fan, so I forced myself to watch this.

Wow, was I surprised!  No corny chimp humor, and lots of heart! Rather than ""The Barefoot Executive"", this film looked more like ""A Dog From Flanders""!

The film is a bit of an Air Bud take-off. But that's good - because like Air Bud, the emphasis is on the people, not just the animal. Kevin, who stars in all three of the Air Bud films, plays another jock, but this time he's a star player from the start. Unlike ""Air Bud 3"", Kevin is featured in lots of hockey scenes, sharing the ice with not only real-life professional hockey players, but even director Robert Vince (you'll see his name credit under ""Hockey Players"")!

The DVD features (an older) Kevin in the Production Featurette and in his first-ever (that I know of) feature-length commentary.",980726400,2,918,4.5120481927710845
1389728,5,B000053GSK,"I live in the US, where MVP has not been released. On my vacation to Spain, I saw it on the plane. I have got to say, this is by far my FAVORITE movie. This Chimpanzee knows how to act. He could do everthing from Ice Skating to making his own cereal. This is one of those movies which must be bought. It is fun to watch over and over. Even though this movie is aimed to the kids, I still seemed to enjoy it. And by the way, Jack(the star of the movie) is not a Monkey, He is a Chimp.",978566400,,483,3.7450980392156863
1389729,5,B000053GSK,"In the fine tradition of monkey movies comes MVP, Most Valuable Primate. This film only got a limited release here in the states, but in the fine country of Canada it was the number one kids film, and who could blame them for making it so. This film follows the adventures of Jack, a mischeavous little primate that is a wizz at playing hockey. So, what is the worst team in the league going to do, of course, recruit Jack to come in as their ringer and assist them in winning games. This film comes to us from the makers of Air Bud, a fine line of family films, not personally my thing, since they all had a dog, monkeys are the way to go. This film is great for everyone. It has elements that everyone can get into, team work, overcoming adversity, hockey, and of course, a crazy little primate named Jack.",977443200,4,808,4.287581699346405

1389734,5,B000053GSK,"A delightful family movie, I think all ages would enjoy this fun and also very  meaningful movie. A monkey becomes part of children's lives, then their families and then the chidren's school",1385856000,,190,4.9375
1389735,5,B000053GSK,"Really cute story with an easy to follow plot for younger children

1389736,5,B000053GSK,I bought this movie for my 3 year old son who loves hockey.  This is one of the cutest hockey movies I've ever seen.  The seller shipped quickly and the DVD was in perfect shape.,1329091200,,178,4.057142857142857

they are all Hockey crazy, and cannot wait to see it again myself!!!",1324252800,,196,4.184210526315789
1389739,5,B000053GSK,This is one of if not the best movie I have ever purchased for my boy(hockey players).  They love this movie.  When asked what they want to watch during tv time it is always this movie.  They even enact this movie as they pretend play hockey.  It is so cute and I love it.  Great Movie!!!

1389740,5,B000053GSK,Arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I would buy used DVD's from this seller again.,1278806400,,91,5.133333333333334
1389741,5,B000053GSK,"Simply put this film is a work of art. An epic tale of love, adventure, and tragedy peppered with cutting wit and humor, it is a masterpiece worthy of the immortal bard Shakespeare himself. Never have I seen such a talented thespian as Jack. His masterful acting is reminiscent of DeNiro in Raging Bull and the action scenes would make Schwarzenegger himself weep with pride. The camera work is amazing and the scene where Jack must decide the fate of the conductor's hat is so soulful and suspenseful I literally had white knuckles from clenching my Pabst Blue Ribbon bottle waiting for the outcome. I shouted aloud, ""No Jack, you mustn't give in to the dark side of your soul!"" as I punched the side of my trailer in rage and disgust (which startled Moonbeam my wolf). Then I breathed a deep sigh of relief when he chose the path of good by returning it. I must warn those of you with heart conditions, this film may be too intense for you.

Bravo Jack, you've captured our hearts. Bravo.",1277856000,7,990,4.5307262569832405
1389742,4,B000053GSK,Bought it as a joke for my uncle who just recently started playing hockey.  It went over well.  Who will look at this review anyway?,1265500800,,132,4.24
1389743,5,B000053GSK,"This movie is very cute for any monkey lover.  It was hysterical watching how they got the monkey to play hockey, but completely entertaining.  I was impressed.  But the real fun was watching my six year old cheering the monkey on and being so into it.",1230681600,3,252,4.434782608695652
1389744,4,B000053GSK,"I ordered this movie for my husband's cousin, who's 7 and crazy about hockey. He loves the movie and has added it to his constantly playing hockey movie marathon. You'll love this fun story too about a Monkey who breaks out and joins the hockey team.",1169337600,5,250,4.456521739130435
1389745,1,B000053GSK,"Regardless of what you order, you get full screen, which really pisses me off.  There is no excuse for only making a full screen DVD in the 21st Century!!!",1142812800,2,155,4.344827586206897

1389747,5,B000053GSK,"A great funny comedy film featuring a clever chimp,Jack, who has a exciting journey on his way home where his family lives. Things didn't turn out according to plan when he got off in

canada, his wrong destination. Fortunately Jack found a young girl the name of Tara and made friends with her. Jack also became the star player of the local ice hockey team. In the end he went on another journey and arrived back home. It's a wonderful film that will get you giggling on a day in!!",1135728000,2,482,4.355555555555555
1389748,5,B000053GSK,"I loved this movie, and couldn't wait to watch MVP2.  I love how smart and entertaining these chimps are.  After watching MVP2 I started searching for another to watch and found out MXP is out!!!! Going to order immediately so I can keep watching.",1113609600,,247,4.590909090909091
1389749,5,B000053GSK,"If you can't laugh at this movie then you've got some major issues.  While some people may look at it as a wonderful and touching family film, it's just as great if you're in the 18-24 demographic and looking for some low-brow (but highly entertaining) comedy.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but a hockey-playing monkey is just about the best thing that's ever happened to Hollywood.  And let's not forget that Jack went on to become a master skateboarder and snowboarder (in MVP 2 and MXP, respectively).  This monkey is a top-notch actor, athlete, scholar, and gentleman.",1076976000,7,568,4.824742268041237
