8162785,5,B000LP50OA,"Impressed with the skill -- real performance, not inflated by special effects, exciting, showy, the younger kids who perform with the adults are also fantastic, fun for all ages, four discs included, and very glad I got this set!",1299888000,2,229,4.897435897435898

in their abilities to perform these skills. This needs to be an Olympic sport. You'll be amazed by the skills on this video.",1187481600,7,198,4.852941176470588
8162787,5,B000LP50OA,"I enjoyed this set and it is great value for money. I expected one DVD, but when I received it, discovered that it consisted of a set of four. I love acrobatics, gymnastics and dance and this is a feast. Although primarily acrobatics, there are some beautiful dance secquences as well. Also acrobatics combined with juggling. There are several trapeze acts and various aerial displays with leather loops and silk bands. It is a feast of circus acts, but nothing involving animals. Impossible to get bored no matter how often I watch them. Most importantly, one is able to enjoy the acrobatics because the cameramen/producers of these DVDs allow you to watch the acrobats and to see as much of the act as it is possible to see on camera, instead of attempting to display their own ingenuity and creativity with camera angles and cut-aways and what-have-you that merely irritate and stop you from seeing the whole thing. Bravo to these cameramen and editors who are humble enough to put their own creativity on hold and allow you to see as much of the performance as possible.",1179532800,7,1074,4.748663101604278
