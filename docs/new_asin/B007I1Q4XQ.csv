Simone Simon is near the end of her on again off again Hollywood run here before returning to France where she would make more films and allegedly romance with the real life James Bond.  While the cast is mostly B actors with the exception of the smaller role for Robert Mitchum, the story is another interesting twist on the WWII housing shortages.  Simone is a new wartime worker taking the apartment of a soldier shipping out.  Along the way she finds that he has lent out a number of keys to the place to other service men on leave.  Needless to say this creates a jumble of character interactions and scandal in the building.  Along the way Simon finds quick romance with more than one character which culminates in a wild finale of sorts which will either leave you guessing, laughing, or shaking your head.  Mixed in for good measure is the voice of Bugs Bunny (Mel Blanc) as a little gremlin set-up upon Simon to mess up her life with seven weeks of bad luck.  While it is not a great movie for laughs or production values, it is an entertaining little movie if you go in with reasonable expectations.",1383350400,,1186,4.433179723502304

In the interest of full disclosure I should admit that James Ellison was my uncle.  But that didn't cloud my remarks.  I couldn't stand some of the clunkers he made!",1357603200,4,373,4.197183098591549
