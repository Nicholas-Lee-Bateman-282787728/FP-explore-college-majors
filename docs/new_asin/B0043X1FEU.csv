4258245,2,B0043X1FEU,"With a name like Bill Zebub, you probably have a pretty good idea of what you're getting in terms of film quality, acting, and plot.  That should frame your expectations, so you don't complain that the camera work doesn't hold up when compared with Titanic, or something ludicrous like that.  It is pretty much what it claims to be.  You'll see a variety of young women stripped, have demeaning sexual acts performed upon them, and threatened heartily.  The majority of the movie is seen from the perspective of the rapist.  That's...pretty much it.  It suffices as a plot, puts things into some kind of context, but probably won't engage your mind very much.  Overall, not very enjoyable to my tastes.  The women were all fairly attractive, goth-type chicks.  They do appear to get completely nude, and the camera wanders over them to reveal lots of detail (but little enough that ""appear to get"" is the operative phrase here).  The 'action', such as it is, is focused on the humiliation of being raped by a stranger, with the unusual addition that rapist forces one woman's father to do the honors.  Visually, it's about what you'd expect.  Fit, young women are shown with some good lighting, but the camera is kind of unsteady at times.  The droning background music is repetitive which inspires more of a feeling of annoyance than the dread that was obviously intended.  Plot-wise...yeah, I've talked about that already.  The 'surprise ending' isn't.  After the ending, there are a series of advertisements for Mr. Zebub's other work, which promise to be much more active but less revealing.

Anyway, I sated my curiosity, but it'll be a while before I watch another Bill Zebub movie.  I don't feel completely ripped-off, at the price I paid.",1300924800,91,1746,4.861016949152543
4258246,1,B0043X1FEU,"This is the worst excuse for a movie I have ever seen.  It was really just some unintelligent babble intertwined with strange grimacing.
Nothing of value here at all.  Absolutely no plot or character development. Amazon should consider raising their criteria for movies and not allow junk made in peoples garages.
Shame on you Amazon!",1299024000,20,334,5.054545454545455
4258247,3,B0043X1FEU,"This is a movie about women who get raped with their own separate scene. People looking for hardcore or X rated material should not buy because they will be disappointed. What I mean by hardcore or X rated is vaginal penitration or touching. There is none of that, but they do show the womans vagina. There are seven different women in the film. Six of them get fully undressed, one keeps her panties on. The first woman ONLY, the guy makes the woman walk and crawl back and forwards in her apartment in the nude. Everything else is the same for all the women. After he tells them to and makes them get undressed he makes them lay down. He then proceeds to gropes/squeeze their breasts for a lengthy amount of time. This is the only time you see the man. One of the women they show the whole man doing this. Otherwise they just show his hands grabbing their breasts. During this time they also scroll the camera up and down her body and show the womans vagina with sometimes her legs being spread.  They go back and forward between the two shots and also sometimes show the womans face which is supposed to look frieghtened. After this is when the woman is actually supposed to be getting raped. They only show her body from her breasts up to her face. Most of the time they concentrate on the face. There is one lady that is great at acting out the rape scene and what I mean by that is that when they show her facial expressions when she is supposed to be getting raped, she could/might make you believe that she actually is being raped if you didn't know it was just a movie. After the guy is done raping the women, he makes them go take a shower. Here you get to watch them take the shower. After their done he tells them not to tell anybody and then leaves. I wouldn't pay a lot of money for this movie, but if you can find it cheap enough and don't expect a lot from it, it might be a good one to watch when your bored. Four out of the six women are bald, the other two are very well trimmed. The womens breasts are real. A couple of the women have facial piercings. The second movie on this DVD  is complete garbage. The person that made should be ashamed of making it and I'm putting that very mildly. I won't go into describing it because I already wasted enough of my time watching it.",1432512000,,2295,4.237442922374429

Really don't waste your time. I'm a fair fan of exploitation art. This is just empty space. There's nothing there to hang your hat on. No story, no talent at all. The photography and quality of the production don't even offer anything. Believe me that I'm not offended at all by good dirty exploitation fun. I'm offended by the fact that hacks like this even have the gall to release such untalented unimaginative trash. I truly do implore you to skip this because you'll never be able to get that precious time you wasted back. Watch Cannibal Holocaust instead.",1358208000,21,749,4.859375

4258273,3,B0043X1FEU,"Okay, this movie wastes absolutely no time in getting to the rape, as a hot goth girl is surprised in her bedroom, and forced to strip, go on all fours like a dog, and is ultimately raped.  Then there are montage shots of about a half-dozen other girls, most of whom are incredibly hot, all being forced to strip and are then raped.  Lastly, we get two more stories.  In the first, the least attractive girl is abused again and then her father is forced to rape her.  In the second, the most attractive (and large-chested) woman is threatened with death and is then abused again and raped.

Throughout the movie, though, the girls remain absolutely silent, which detracts from what could otherwise be a great rape piece, because the girls are being shown raped from the rapist's perspective.  His voice is a strange monotone, which also detracts from the movie, and there really is no plot to it, which there doesn't need to be, but it would be nice.

In all, I'm glad I got this movie for as little money as I did, and I would recommend anyone thinking of buying it to shop around and get the cheapest price.  The girls are hot, and the rape is nice, but with no pleading, protesting, screaming or squeaking, it just sort of sits there.",1313452800,38,1237,4.466666666666667
