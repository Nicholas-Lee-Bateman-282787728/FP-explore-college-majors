7861243,4,6304030657,"Higher on the strange factor than The Maxx, as well as being less profound about it's humanity, Aeon Flux is nonetheless fascinating, highly original,  and down right kick ass.  Any fan of adult animation would find this very  stylized, sometimes unsettling vison of sex and violence in whatever  bizarre, alternate reality it exists in, very cool, indeed.",965606400,,356,5.192982456140351
7861244,4,6304030657,"As a science fiction book this would make it, as a movie this would make  it, maybe even as some sort of CD, but the perfect format for these  interesting storylines is none of those but rather the animated TV series  format that it finds itself in.  Its the perfect format to accentuate the  hard edged never quite all there feeling that this storyline brings about.  Reminiscent to me of so many of the storyline/mythos type TV shows that are  out there where they never quite tell you what is going on, Aeon Flux is  still better than many of those in that it always gives you just enough to  make you think you have some idea of what's going on while never giving you  too much.  This first tape contains some of my absolute favorite episodes.  I plan to buy the rest as well, but this definitely is the best of them.  This is truly the closest America has ever come to the same type of anime  produced abroad and in some ways I prefer it since the storylines  definitely all have an American edge to them.  Overall an excellent video  with a very postmodern feel to it.",961372800,,1074,4.316582914572864
7861245,5,6304030657,"""That which does not kill us, makes us stranger"" - Dr. Trevor Goodchild, Aeon Flux
My wife was using the computer to talk to her mother in England, and my 3 month old son was crying. I turned on some classical  music... didn't help. Turned on the TV to MTV and put him in front of it.  La Ley came on... first time I've ever seen the Chilean band, though they  were managed by wife's cousins' husband. Cool, I thought. My son stopped  crying.
Next thing I know, Aeon Flux was on. My son started crying again,  so I took him to his mother and watched what I thought was a  crazy-future-spider-woman-cartoon (my father in-law's real name is Peter  Parker). Anyway...
As an AI guy working on artificial consciousness, I  found myself fascinated. I became fully involved in the show. I think this  is the first time that has ever happened without altering my brain  chemistry.
Is this what kids are growing up on now?  My God, I can  forgive Pokemon and Dragon Ball now.
I obviously need to change my  audience. Young people today deal with technological issues that many  researchers just refuse to consider seriously.
I digress... Suffice it to  say, I'm buying every episode. This is the first cartoon that ever caused  me to take notes since the very first episode of Ren & Stimpy I saw  that caused me to have a heavy flashback.",955843200,7,1329,4.516806722689076
7861246,5,6304030657,"This first of the three Aeon Flux tape contains the best episodes of this very unusual animated MTV series. The storylines are the most engaging, the animation is top-notch... all in all, those who enjoy animation and/or the  cyberpunk genre should DEFINATELY add this to their collection.",945648000,5,289,5.148936170212766
7861247,5,6304030657,Aeon Flux is simply the best thing to come out of MTV.  This sexy killer plows her way though countless soldiers of her neighboring country. cirtenly a bloodbath for all ages.,944870400,,175,4.645161290322581
7861248,5,6304030657,"Aeon's cryptic performance is surely for our observation, and yet we lack the key to unlock it's mystery. Every glance, every gesture is part of an arcane language, imparting complex messages to the initiated-yet always, we  may hazard, concealing the threat of unreliability. We know neither the  meanings nor what the meanings obscure. Lies, secrets, and silence. Is it all  an illusion-the cruelest of illusion,because it hides nothing?This  intriguing story is nothing short of a masterpeice, original in every way.",944265600,,519,5.45
7861249,5,6304030657,"""Aeon Flux"" involves a distopian nation known as ""Bregna,"" populated with mentally stifled citizens, and a bordering territory, ""Monica,"" which has no legal representation in the Breen government.  Aeon Flux, a strange, intriguing, and quite deadly woman from Monica is often brought into contact with the equally strange and intriguing Trevor Goodchild, the chairman of Bregna.  Aeon could be stereotyped as a secret agent for Monica, or a mercenary, (she has acted as both) but all anyone can truly say about her is that she despises control and will always follow her own initiative, not someone else's.  Trevor could be equally misunderstood as a power-hungry despot, eager to crush free will and liberty.  Instead, he is a radical reformer, one who is dedicated to the peaceful homogenization of the Breen.  He craves control, not power, and the control of a single Breen's life is as interesting to him as the command of the masses.  Aeon and Trevor oppose each other as much as any two people could, but it is nearly impossible to logically classify either of them as good or evil.  Aeon could be good because she fights for freedom (any definition of freedom applies), but she is a callous destroyer, one who will help one man with his petty needs (she passes a fresh roll of toilet paper to a man in a stall) yet ignores the plights of a crippled man trying to save his dog.  Trevor is a reformer, a builder, and employs no gestapo to enforce his order.  It is this ""moral vaccum"" that the creator, Peter Chung, intended when he created ""Aeon Flux,"" and it is refreshing to see Trevor and Aeon disagree with each other on such philosophical issues as the flawless duplication of humans (does one person's life become worthless, because they are now ""extraneous, and in the end, disposable?""), especially when they both claim to care for people in general, but treat them in contempt on the personal level. Of course, there are also those who merely watch the series for its lesser, baser qualities, such as the fact that Aeon is clad in nearly nothing most of the time, and the pronnounced sexual overtones in most of the episodes.  Violence, however, is not a factor (the initial 12-minute, 6-segment short ""Aeon Flux"" had TONS of people being massacred left and right, but as a satire of the heroic character) yet danger is clearly implied; you KNOW this woman is capable of the most despicable acts of violence.  As an added factor, Aeon died in all the first and second-season shorts, each death being significant to the plot: the creator could get away with her doing anything and not have people say she didn't pay for it.  The animation itself is a reason to watch the series, if you like animation for its own sake.  Chung utilizes bizzare and unlikely camera angles, pans with multiple backgrounds, and a unique charachter design (rather gaunt, yet fully expressive).  One of the shorts simply starts in the most unlikely of places: an internal view of two mouths opening in a French kiss, the tongues caressing each other like worms (yuck!) before one opens a tooth-compartment in the other's mouth, and puts a secret message in it.  Overall, I appreciate and enjoy this series.  You should not miss it if you are a psychologist, or an animation fan, or simply someone who like wierdness or distopian sagas. This video collects four randomly-selected thirty-minute episodes from the MTV series, and contains all the original shorts that spawned it on ""Liquid Television.""
