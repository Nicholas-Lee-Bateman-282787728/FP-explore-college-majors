8382299,1,B002VLYKRK,"This DVD masquerades as the Class Action College Admissions Process--""following three students through their admissions process at Georgetown.""  However, it only shows PART 1 of the Nightline special, and Part 2 is inexplicably not available anywhere.  Part 2 is the section that shows the three students in specific and reveals whether or not they got in.  Without that portion, this video is lackluster at best.",1379980800,,413,5.323076923076923
8382300,1,B002VLYKRK,"I ordered this dvd to show to my seniors at the start of the school year as they are in the midst of the college admissions process. So I receive the dvd and watch it at home in order to preview it before class. 20 minutes in it appears to end a segment (I suppose how it was shown on tv) and says ""in our next segment see what happens to the applications as they arrive at the colleges and..."" The dvd ends and goes back to the menu. So I look for part 2 and...nothing. I was sold the first part of a three part series on the college admissions process. Yet nowhere in the product description does it indicate that this has multiple parts and you are only purchasing part one. The best part? I searched Amazon, part 2 and 3 are not even for sale. Long story short, the dvd was useless. What good does it do my students to only show them 20 minutes of a 60 minute program that is supposed to follow high school seniors through the admissions process? Happy ending to this mess...Amazon took the dvd back and returned my money with no hassle.",1350518400,,1041,4.1840796019900495
