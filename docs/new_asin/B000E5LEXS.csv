2492303,4,B000E5LEXS,"As another reviewer mentioned, I was also introduced to JD after my 14 year old son showed me the very funny ""Achmed the Dead Terrorist"" sketch on the internet.

Although this specific DVD does not contain the above puppet at all, it's still a very funny show of a highly talented artist.
You should, however, check it first to yourself before sharing the fun with your kids, as most of the stuff is for adult audience only.

It contains many sexual references, and lots of stuff that may be considered by some as offending and ""non-PC"".
This is not surprising when some of your characters are a grumpy old bigot and a pimp..
There's actually a bleeped audio track as well as a non-bleeped one, and the audience many times goes ""Ohhhhh......"" instead of simple laughter, wherever the jokes go below the belt...
One of the beauties of ventriloquism is the ease with which such stuff is accepted by the audience, as this point is well discussed in the commentary, where at some point JD
laughs that with all the lines he's able to cross with the puppets, he could almost get away with murder...

Personally I found the show very funny and JD is a very good performer. The few minutes at the start before the first puppet comes to life is average stand-up at most, but once the puppets
kick in JD shines in his performance up to the end.

The DVD contains a live stage show at Santa Ana that was very well shot and directed, with very good sound and picture quality.

I've reduced a star for the DVD production because of:
A. The total lack of subtitles. I think that a product that is aimed at such a wide audience must come with subtitles, and this should be a basic feature of every DVD, especially one that (as stated on th back of this one)
pertains to ""...set the new standard for how truly awesome a comedy DVD can be."" Some titles go as far as having subtitles for the commentary track which is really great.
B. There seems to be a problem with 2 bonus clips, that appear on the menu but fail to play, no matter what playback option I tried. (any comment on that would be appreciated - maybe I missed how to play it)

Regarding the other extras:

There are two nice outtakes with a short commentary track, running around 3 minutes each.
There's also a full feature audio commentary track that is well worth hearing. It has JD (+ Walter) and Kelly Ashbury (Author of Dummy Days and co-director of Shrek 2) having a fluent free conversation about ventriloquism at general and of JD's career and show in particular.

That is, of course, if you're not offended by Walter's remark at the beginning of the commentary:
""...If the folks are actually listening to this audio commentary..
you have no life at this point, wouldn't that be about the truth,
if you have enough time to sit down and listen to this crap..""

Bottom line - highly recommended if you like good non-PC comedy and have an affection to this fascinating form of art.",1349568000,,2932,4.485928705440901

This man is a ridiculously unfunny hack relying on only the most played out stereotypes and overtly stupid material.  I am sure that if he could make anyone laugh without a puppet in his hand he would, just as if most children's book writers would write for adults if they could.  This is pandering garbage, pure and simple.  Anyone with just an average intelligence (which is dropping all the time it would seem) knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is unfunny drivel.  The fact that anyone could enjoy this is absurd to me, yet I know that so many do.

Does anyone else remember his short lived television show? Would anyone care to tell me why such a funny comedian couldn't hack it for one entire season before being canned?  That is proof positive that at least some segment of the population still has enough sense to change the channel when they see some moron with a doll up on stage... a glimmering hope for America which is slowly receding into the distance.  Please, I am begging anyone who agrees with me to give this 1 star.  Help me make it clear that we still have a collective sense of humor beyond goofy voices and thinly veiled racism.

The characters who worked on this show with him include:

Walter, an old curmudgeon with a face like a prune.
Sweet Daddy D, introduced as his new manager.
Bubba J, a beer swilling NASCAR fan.
Peanut, who is something alien, I think.
Jose Jalapeno in a stick. Yes, a jalapeno pepper in a Mexican hat. On a stick.

From the cantankerous Walter to the smooth Sweet Daddy D, every character is unique both in sound and ""personality"". For me the highlight was the scene where Peanut and Jose talk in Spanish and Jeff protests that he feels left out because he ""doesn't speak Spanish"" - the line is great, the comedic timing is exquisite.

I heard a lot about this guy and decided to watch this specific special on Comedy Central. It's effing horrible! None of the jokes or impersonations are that great or funny. I let out maybe one or two ""ha!'s"" during the whole thing. Not a laugh, just a ""ha!"", like ""Wow, this guy is so bad!"".

Everyone seems to love the ""Dead Terrorist"" character who just says ""I kill you!"" over and over. It's not funny. I wonder what the families of 9/11 and those overseas fighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq think about that garbage. His redneck and grumpy white guy characters are also just as lame and unfunny. If I wanted to see rednecks, I'd just watch Larry the Cable Guy. Hell, I thought that the Blue Collar Guys weren't that funny, but compared to Jeff Dunham, they are great. If I wanted to see an old guy grumble and make lewd comments, I'd just go visit my own Grandpa. He's 100 times funnier than Jeff Dunham's puppet.

I heard a lot of hype about this guy, only to find out that he is a complete unfunny nerd. Maybe it's accepted widely as ""Family Comedy"" because there is not really much use of profanity, but I think that promoting every sort of racial stereotype out there with these puppets is far more offensive than the dirtiest joke, an hour of curse words and anything that Howard Stern has ever said on the radio that ""Christians"" and the FCC found so offensive.",1328659200,14,1541,4.384615384615385

2492371,1,B000E5LEXS,"Jeff Dunham is a racist.  His ""characters"" are mostly based on blatant stereotypes that are immediately offensive to anyone with any sort of empathy towards the feelings of others.  These are not clever jokes based on the differences of diverse cultures.  These are insulting caricatures on the same level as black face or buck toothed ""ching chong ding dong"" characters. I was shocked to discover that something this tasteless existed in the new millennium, let alone that a talentless ""comic"" could hide his inability to tell jokes behind this disgusting display.

It makes me physically ill to listen to his thinly-veiled racist jokes. I use the word jokes pretty liberally there, it's really just ""who's the dummy"" brand schtick with a bunch of catch phrases thrown in from the racist stereotype characters he has created.

Now, almost 20 years later, I've learned that a family friend had a hand in starting Jeff down the puppet/ventriloquist path.  I had him autograph the page in Jeff's book where he's mentioned & he told me, ""the facts aren't QUITE right, but I'll give it to him.  He's famous & doing well....."".
  My favorite bit was from the '90's when Peanut picked out a guy in the audience, ""Hey, Rob!  Neeeeeeeyowr!"" - Now I like the interplay of the characters.  Mr. Dunham has done very well for himself & I'm ALWAYS entertained!  Congratulations, Jeff!",1312416000,,649,4.573913043478261

2492412,5,B000E5LEXS,"In this day, it's great to have something you can lose yourself in to get away from our every day troubles and trials. ""Jeff Dunham-Arguing with Myself"" DVD does just that. Street crime, wars, economy miseries blare out of our TV's with such regularity, we have no recourse but to feel miserable about life, So why not put this in your DVD player and get away from it all for awhile. Does the heart good.

I watched this hilarious DVD while my daughter was visiting us, back in 2008. My husband and I thought this was one of the most uproariously, hilarious ventriloquist acts we've ever seen. So, after discussing the many Christmas gift choices, we had, due to our financial situation, I decided to buy this DVD for my friends, who live in another state. I was concerned it may be a little too risque for my girlfriend, but, as it turned out, she loves it. She just could not stop raving about how she and her husband, and friends they have shared it with, absolutely think it is the best time they have had in a long time and has brought both of them many hours of enjoyment.

This DVD was inexpensive and I loved that I could have it sent to their home. It arrived in time for Christmas besides. Sadly, I don't own the DVD myself.... yet. I intend on purchasing all of Jeff's DVD's, in the near future, so we can enjoy them and share them with our friends, too.

Every time I call my friend, she tells me how her friends have, now, bought their own DVD so they can watch it anytime they want.

Jeff Dunham presents his marionettes, in such a way, they all seem real, although we know they aren't. His ventriloquism, talent shines through with Arthur, Peanut, Achmed, and Jalapeno on a Stick. I love Arthur, even though he is a super grump and is always complaining about everything, from his wife, whom we never see, to every day life's common events. Peanut is my favorite since he is always giving Jeff and Jalapeno on a Stick a rough time. With his yellow tuff, of hair,  and his purple body, and his ear to ear mouth, he is so much fun to watch. This is, especially, when he puts his head back, laughing at something he got over on Jeff. Achmed's, ""I will kill you,"" every few minutes, adds irony to the fact that he doesn't even realize he is dead and can't kill anyone. All of the characters are so different from each other, and Jeff moves from one in such a smooth transition, there is never a boring moment from beginning to end in this DVD.

Bring out the popcorn, and other tasty eats and drinks, put in ""Jeff Dunham-Arguing with Myself,"" or any of his other DVD's and get ready to enjoy a couple of hours of getting away from the world and your troubles. If you want a good laugh or are looking for the ideal gifts, get this DVD or one of Jeff's other DVD's (Heck! Why not buy a whole set for yourself and or your friends and families? Double, triple or quadruple your fun.). You'll have a terrific, hilarious time, and your friends will thank you.",1301356800,,2964,4.350813743218806
2492413,5,B000E5LEXS,"I can't get enough of Dunham and his multi-talented performances. He has created and portrays such marvelous characters.

Cut to just about a couple of months ago, a co-worker and I happened to be talking about the best Comedy Routines he has seen-Jeff Dunham and Lisa Lampenilli (Sp?). Just for the hick of it I went to Blockbuster and rented Jeff Dunham's Arguing With Myself and Spark Of Insanity! Good Lord!!!!!!!! I laughed so hard I had to pause the DVD player just to breath and literally catch my breath! Then he brings out Peanut! Geez'US H KEE'Rist I had to go to put Depends on because of the SAW-NA-TA-AH-NA Routine!! PAUSE the DVD player again Dam-it to catch my breath again! Then Peanut starts to crack on some of the poor unfortunate souls who have to deal with physical issues! Stop the DVD again to catch my breath again because I'm laffing so G'Dam hard-then G'dam Peanut starts crackin' on one of the Audience Members-------Had to go change out the Depends! I really like that comment about using these DVD's as greeting cards! Great Great Stuff! When I first saw Peanut on the cover of Arguing With Myself-I'm thinking-""what the hell is that?"" After watching the DVD's for the omp-teenth time--Peanut is definitely MY fav character-then Sweeeeet Daddy D, then Walter! Peanut must have escaped off the set of Sesame Street,gone rogue, abused alot of drugs, and alot of alcohol-but the way Jeff works with Peanut you really have to pinch yourself and say the character is not real!

One of the funniest comedians to come along in years. The best thing about Jeff Dunham is that unlike comedians like Dane Cook and Ron White and even politically incorrect comedians like Dennise Miller: Jeff Dunham actually makes you LAUGH! His comedy, even when talking about social and political issues is presented in a light-hearted way as not to be ""We're all F&$#ed"" but rather ""This is Funny"". With Walter and Peanut and the other characters you get conversational comedy which makes it more enjoyable than just a 90 minute monologue. FUNNY AS HELL!",1231632000,,942,4.4508670520231215

The added bonus is that he is hilarious. The routines he has with all of his puppets are equally funny and will have you laughing from beginning to end. This is not a comedy routine for the youngsters because of foul language and inappropriate topics. This is a great stand-up comedy routine that all adults should see.,1228867200,,476,4.546511627906977

Later, I mentioned him to a friend of mine who then clued me in to his name. I caught some of his clips on YouTube then, and then ordered his DVDs. I've horse-laughed over his work ever since. He has to be the greatest ventriloquist I've ever seen perform. My personal favorite charactor is Walter. He reminds me of WAY too many people I've known in my life. Peanut is a very close second. Some may find the entire concepts of Bubba J and Sweet Daddy D offensive, but they're funny, too. Mr. Dunham's technique and ability is truly amazing. His ability to carry on an entire conversation between three diferent charactors, high-speed style, is astounding. I hope to catch Jeff Dunham live some day, as he is just too funny for words, even his stand-up routine at the beginning, minus the puppets, is hilarious! Otherwise, I'll continue to watch the heck out of my DVDs, and laugh until my face hurts!",1225584000,,1026,4.491978609625669

2492832,4,B000E5LEXS,"I saw Jeff Dunham about fifteen years ago on TV, but can't remember where, or what show he was on. After picking up this DVD, it was apparent what I had missed all these years. After about twenty viewings of Arguing With Myself, the DVD still makes me laugh. Almost everything on this DVD is side-splittingly hilarious, and there is the option to view it with or without the naughty language. It's apparent that Jeff has taken great time and effort to give his characters separate and distinct personalities, so that none of the characters seem even vaguely alike, answering the same questions very differently. However, The shots of Sweet Daddy D (with annoying voice-overs) are the only bad point on this DVD. Fortunately, after Sweet Daddy D has his time on stage, we do not have to see any more of him until the closing credits, which gives us the chance to see and hear the wonderful insanity of Peanut, and the interplay between Peanut and Jose Jalapeno.

It's amazing what he can say and get away with because it's coming out of their mouths.

And for someone to change his voice the way he does and actually ""throws"" his voice that it sounds like it's coming from a different direction - that takes talent - real talent.

I first saw Jeff Dunham on Comedy Central and just had to see the whole video.  If you've seen him there, don't think you've seen the video, there are a lot of good things that they cut out on Comedy Central so they can fit it in the time slot with commercials. It's well worth getting the video. Jeff is so good that you forget that he's the one making the voices for all the puppets. And don't miss the out takes, first listen to the commentary on them so you know what's going on, then watch without it, it's hysterical!",1204070400,,680,4.223076923076923
2493014,3,B000E5LEXS,"I first saw this guy in the early '90s on A&E, and he was doing a lot of this same material; the ""on a stick"" schtick has been used in his act for at least 15 years. I found him quite amusing, and I still do, but with at least one caveat: he tries too hard these days to inject his political axe-grinding into the act. Rather like Drew Carey and the creators of South Park -- two other right-wing comedians who are actually funny when they stick to comedy -- he apparently thinks he's accumulated enough of a following that he should now use his clout to promote the cause. (See the dead terrorist skit and the Prius/Hummer one.) They really aren't funny and are pretty ineffective; those who praise those two skits can't be doing so on comedic merits, because those skits have almost none. It's a pity, really, because when Dunham sticks to comedy, he's really pretty talented (see the opening monologue about the puppet and the airport screeners, as well as the ones about Bubba and his wife -- ""Where'd you meet her? At the family reunion"" -- as well as almost everything on here (Walter and the ""menstrual cycle"" is very amusing) except the pimp bit, which was rather forced. Dude... you're a comedian. Stick to that and let Rush Limbaugh be the talentless political blowhard.",1203984000,5,1280,4.545454545454546

2493020,5,B000E5LEXS,"Being a Ventriloquist myself, I've been knowing of Jeff Dunham since the early 80s. Though, honestly, I never had a chance to see any of his shows til more recently on several TV shows on TV. When I saw this first DVD, I was curious to buy it just to see how well he does in his shows. Besides, you hardly ever see DVDs of Ventriloquists performing unless they are independently done and sold & those, my friend, are hard to come by(your normal everyday joe doesn't go to alot of comedy shows). If you do see DVDs of Ventrilquists, it's usually geared more towards kids(like ""The Shari Show"" with Shari Lewis, ""Zoey's Wild Things"" with Mallory Lewis-both of which I recommend for the younger set- or something in that vein).  Up until recently; my favorite Ventriloquists were Edgar Bergen, Jimmy Nelson, Shari Lewis, and a couple more closer to my age...Mark Wade & Jay Johnson(Star of the old comedy series, ""Soap""). After seeing this DVD, I'm proud to add Jeff to the list. I tell you, I never laughed so hard for so long in my life. In this DVD, you meet Walter(a wisecracking old man who bellyaches about almost everything), Sweet Daddy D(Jeff's blunt but hilarious agent), Bubba J(a slow but surprising funny NASCAR nut)  Peanut(a wacky wacky youngster from the Micronesian Islands), and Jose the Jalapeno(a Jalapeno from Mexico- on a steeeeeek! What more can be said there..). Performing stand-up comedy with his pals, Jeff is at his peak with this show. If you don't get any other Jeff Dunham DVD, get this one. It's worth every last penny and then some. I've had this DVD for quite some time and, everytime I watch it, I still laugh.",1203638400,,1642,4.639175257731959

OH MY GOD! It is absolutely hilarious. My favorite character is Peanut and he has coined quite a few phrases that seem to fit certain life situations and have the power to lighten up my day. I have watched this performance numerous times and I still lose myself every time. Walter, Jos and Bubba J. are very funny as well, but cannot quite reach Peanut's performance and appearance (I mean there are women that would kill for those lips).
I can't say I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys a good stand up comedy with a twist, since I don't know what may tickle you funny bone, but I would recommend it to myself any day.",1199577600,,793,4.401360544217687

2493287,5,B000E5LEXS,Jeff Dunham is a comic genius.  As a ventriloquist he is one of -- if not -- THE best.  He not only creates unique puppets for his act but he gives them life through his handling and his wit.  Any doubt about his talent is answered in laughter especially when two of his puppet friends begin arguing with each other....in Spanish.  Politically-incorrect on all levels.  PG-13 at least.,1199404800,,385,4.602941176470588

That being said, if you've never seen Dunham you are in for a treat.  He's funny and each of his characters has a distinct personality that plays so well off of Dunham's straight man act. Peanut, Walter, and the rest interact with the audience and Dunham is very fast on his feet and with his vocal cords.

Obviously I'm a fan.  I've followed his work since the 90s when he would appear on the Comic Strip TV show and have seen a number of his Comedy Central specials.  The only low point in this routine is the introduction of a new character, Sweet Daddy, as Dunham's manager otherwise it's a great set that will have you laughing for hours.",1198627200,4,914,4.27906976744186

I think what Jeff does best is switch so seamlessly between characters - whether that be the puppets or himself.  He does that at the drop of a hat - changes voice, pitch, mood - you name it, and so quickly, too.  It is truly uncanny.  He is the consummate professional.  Does 8 different puppets- characters, 9 if you include the puppet master.  My favorite is Walter.  Walter for President!

I laughed so hard that I cried.  Three times.  Since then, I've watched this video at least 10 times, and it never gets old.  It still busts me up with laughter.  His 5 ""guests"" are all unique and wildly entertaining, and Jeff's abilities as both a witty comic and as a talented ventriloquist are simply incredible.

The best part about the DVD, you have two verisons, clean (TV) or the adult (some parts not show on TV), Walter talks alot more about his sex life. If you want to laugh alot, then get busy and order it while supplies last at 20.00 for the set.

Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there. But then, enough of that, and let's give a huge round of applause for this guy. He is simply BRILLIANT. And for those of you Latin guys who go: ""Oh this is wrong, politically incorrect..""

A new joke would be told before I finished laughing from the last one. I couldn't keep up...LOL!!

I watch it a lot. His ability and talent are outstanding, but the characters he has created are unforgettable.  It was obvious by audience reaction that MANY others love ""Peanut"" as much as I do, and ""Walter"" is another character I love.  This wonderful entertainer has such a natural comedy ability and just captures the audience in the belief that Peanut is real and Jeff believes he is real.

2493903,4,B000E5LEXS,"This DVD features both the bleeped and un-bleeped recordings of

this performance.  The bleeped version is of course what has been

aired on TV.  Both versions of this performance on DVD also

include some additional scenes that were spliced into the

televised version.  In my not so humble opinion, these added bits

didn't add much that was actually laugh-out-loud funny.

The commentary track is a mixed bag.  Overall it seems a bit

amateurish.  There is some interesting information about how

Dunham came to create his characters, stories about some of his

early experiences, and a few observations about the performance

featured.  But the commentary is uneven and is poorly recorded.

On the other hand the included out-takes, and the bonus snippet

of Peanut's encounter with the family dog are very funny, so

there is at least a few 'extras' that are more than just filler

on the DVD.

Bottom Line: If you have never seen this on TV, then all these

carps are immaterial since the performance itself is very very

funny and well worth watching and having.  Or even if you have

seen this on TV, you'll no doubt enjoy watching this performance

again and having the opportunity to share it with friends.  But

if you're buying this with the expectation that you're going to

get a *lot* more funny material beyond what you saw on TV, you're

probably going to be somewhat disappointed.",1172448000,,1398,4.825531914893617

This dvd of Jeff Dunham's live performance is consistantly funny, and yet also unique for his use of ventriloquism. With the ""unbleeped"" version you will get swearing but coming from a bunch of puppets it's both acceptable and incredibly funny. Likewise, audience members genuinely laugh when they're picked on by these puppets, rather than take offense.

My favourite moment - one of the puppets imitating a Japanese Godzilla movie. You know what I mean, when their lips are out of synch with the soundtrack, and their mouth stops moving but they're still speaking.

2494025,4,B000E5LEXS,"** SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT FOR THE LAST PARAGRAPH **

I saw this on Comedy Central and it was funny. I heard that this one was uncut, and since I needed something to bring my amazon cart up to free shipping, gave this a shot. There were quite a few things I either didn't notice before, or was cut on the TV version. The timing on the jokes were definitely better on the DVD.

I had problems playing this DVD on PowerDVD using an SPDIF. Switching PowerDVD to stereo fixed it so that I can watch it. Not a huge problem since a comedy show isn't exactly Star Wars.

Overall, this was hilarious, much more than I expected. I bought a few other DVDs of comedy routines but not that much material was cut compared to what was on Comedy Central. This DVD had a good amount of cut material, and it isn't like the cut material from a lot of (non-comedy) DVDs I've rented (which usually deserved to be cut). This stuff is good.

The menus were horrible. You select an option and there'd be audio and it'd take a while for it to run through. However, it's only a one-time deal before watching the DVD, so it wasn't bad overall (except in my case with the PowerDVD issue where I tried to debug the audio).

There were Sweet Daddy Dee moments popping in on the act and commenting. It wasn't that funny, but just keep watching the rest of the video because it's worth it. It happens a lot less over the length of the video.",1168992000,,1407,4.254681647940075

There are not that many people out there who do ventriloquism and he is really one of the best at it.  There are a couple of funny outtakes on it too.  There are 5 different puppets that he uses and at one point he uses two at once. When you watch it, they don't even seem like puppets at all.  It just looks like a human and a wierd character are having a conversation.  Also, I like the way he has developed the movements and personalities of the Peanut character.",1168819200,,588,4.1875
2494065,4,B000E5LEXS,"Jeff Dunham's ventriloquism is astounding. He can do different voices, accents and pitch without missing a beat. The puppets mannerisms are so realistic you almost forget they're not alive. His stage presence and fluid delivery show a distinct polish -- he's obviously been doing this for a very long time.

He's also quiet good with ad-libbing. During one sequence a member of the audience tries to sneak out and use the rest room. Jeff catches this and incorporates that into his routine, doing so in such a seamless manner as to almost appear rehearsed (which I don't believe it really was). And that bit of improvisation turns about to be some of the funniest stuff he does.

There is a bit of a slow period during the middle, when he does a pimp and a redneck character. Neither of those were as funny as the rest of his stuff, but other then that Jeff Dunham scores big. Definitely worth the money!",1168819200,,904,4.608695652173913

You'll never forget the charaters.  Dunham accomplishes this WITHOUT the overriding use of the F word like so many comedians ... not any easy thing to do in this day and age ... for a one man stand up ventriloquist.  That takes a specail talent that Dunham has polished to a smooth and captivating performace that demonstrates his incredible professional talents ... I've neve seen such an incredibly talented ventriloquist.  So if you are one like me who needs more laughter in their life .... BUY THIS ... I've watched this a least a dozen times and it never fails to reduce me to jelly with laughter ...

2494225,5,B000E5LEXS,"Jeff's wholesome humor, despite a few interjections of raunchiness just to add spice, is not offensive nor vulgar.  He has a pleasant demeanor, and his lovable ""buddies"" are so endearing. It's great to see the interplay between him and each ""buddy"", and how quickly he shifts from one accent or personality to another.  It's so entertaining and amusing to watch the ""buddies"" almost lifelike with their facial expressions.  Walter is so cute you'd like to come up and pinch his cheek, and the redneck Bubba J is hilarious and charming, Sweet Daddy D the pimp has funny mouth expressions, Peanut is so whacky, and the Jalapeno on a ""steek"", adds just that kind-of-spice!  Each buddy has his own unique authenticity to his character which Jeff captures so well with each accent, action, and wise-crack.  Jeff's wit is so sharp and quick and just absolutely funny that you won't want to miss a single word he or any of his ""buddies"" say to each other --or to the audience. My family of teenagers just absolutely loved this DVD and watch it every now and then when we want a really good laugh and just be in a good mood!",1163289600,3,1116,4.616161616161616

2494239,4,B000E5LEXS,"Jeff's comedy is hilarious!  His ventrilquism act with his many different dummies are fun and Jeff is quick-witted.  I found him at his best with Walter (the grumpy old guy) and Jose (Jalepeno on a stick)

There is one slow section on the DVD where they wait for a guy to get back from the bathroom, taunting him and talking with his wife.  The banter is funny but gets old after awhile.

Also, beware if you have preteen/young teenaged children.  There is a ""clean"" side and a not-so-clean side.  We watched the clean side but found it had a lot of language that would at least make it a PG-13 if it were rated (maybe even an R rating).  I was hoping the clean version would be a bit more suitable for my older kids who (when I wasn't fast forwarding and skipping sections) found him funny as well.

I wish there had been more special features on the DVD, although the few outtakes that are included are even more funny than the actual show.  If you've seen Jeff on Comedy Central, you've really only seen *maybe* half of what he does, and just like always the cut out some of the funniest portions, so I highly suggest getting the full feature.

2494319,5,B000E5LEXS,"I saw his routine on Comedy Central and decided I had to have the DVD.

We have watched it several times and it's still funny.  My kids quote lines from it. We had some friends over the other night and by the end, everyone in the room was laughing.  Even the people who had already seen it.

Mr. Dunham is a pretty good ventriloquist, but what makes him better than a lot of his contemporaries is the fast-paced humor and the use of more than one dummy at a time.  The quick jokes and one liners keep you distracted from the fact that it's really just a guy with lotion (a running gag in the video) and you begin to believe that the puppets have their own life.  Especially when he begins to pick on people in the audience.",1156118400,,723,4.16546762589928
2494320,5,B000E5LEXS,If you never see another comic but Jeff you'll be fine. He is by far the funniest and most talented ventriloquist ever. The way he gives each puppet it's own very distinct personality is amazing. Don't let the word puppet turn you off from this video he is still for adults. At least the unbleeped version. Which as a parent I appreciate the opportunity on this DVD to choose the bleeped version.,1156118400,,396,4.513888888888889
2494321,5,B000E5LEXS,"We caught Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself on Comedy Central and enjoyed it so much, but found out later that they aired only half of the show.  We had to see the entire show so we bought the DVD.  Amazon's great price and quick deliver got it here fast!

Jeff is a telented comedian and a wonderful ventriloquist.  Walter is my favorite!  Jeff's quick wit and willingness to be upstaged by his subjects makes for much entertainment.  He is very clever, and has the puppets play off of things throughout the show.  We have decided that it would be cool to see him in person as he involves his audience with much hilarity.

We have watched the DVD a few times since receiving it, and it's currently on loan to a friend at work.  It is great fun!

This is ADULT humor, so be responsible when kids are around and see puppets on the cover.",1156032000,,836,4.301282051282051

2494400,5,B000E5LEXS,"Some people think ventriloquists are cute or novel, but they would never actually want to go to a show with one. It's time to reevaluate your love of puppets, or not.

I've seen a few of Jeff's acts and he's funny on his own. Add in some interesting characters and turn Jeff into the straight man and not your talking. This DVD is full of his best stuff:

Walter - ""Shut the hell up!"" Funny, insulting, jerk of an old man who Jeff continually apologizes for.

Peanut - ""Nnneeyroww!"" The funniest part of the show. It almost seems like he's improvising the whole thing as he goes.

Jose Jalepeno - ""On a steek."" The banter between him and Peanut is priceless.

Bubba J - I think this guy was made to cash in on the Blue Collar Comedy hype. Funny, but not Jeff's best work.

Sweet Daddy Dee - Also meant to cash in on the Kings of comedy tour. Funny, but not to die for. He also makes commentary throughout the DVD which was entirely unnecessary.

Bloopers - I was at the second show and he picked the best of the improve stuff, but I wish he had put it all in. He never is out of character. Never.

So to sum up: Jeff is brilliantly hilarious. Walter, Peanut & Jose are funny. Bubba & Sweet are not. Bloopers are worth it. Buy, buy, buy.",1153785600,,1236,4.2076271186440675

Another good point on the DVD for those out there with families is the ""Bleeped"" and ""Un-bleeped"" option.  Compared to other things out there on television these days, I don't think anything he says is offensive, but there is some language used that parents may not want small children to hear.  The ""Bleeped"" version is the perfect solution.

So gather your friends around and check out this DVD.  Your sides will hurt from laughing!",1153699200,,669,4.765217391304348

I have loved watching Jeff Dunham perform for a long time.  I recently got to see him in person and was thrilled with his performance!!  I would like to be able to see him perform at Kuss Auditorium in Springfield, Ohio if at all possible.  One of his newest characters, Sweet Daddy D, is the epitome of my Black brothers!! If anyone who sees this DVD doesn't find themselves laughing their heads off, then you must not have a sense of humor.

He bounces from his own voice to the dummies' voices in lightning speed and does it brilliantly.  The personalities he has created for each character shine through; it's easy to forget they're not real!  This is one of the few DVD's I can watch repeatedly and still laugh like it's the first time I've seen it.  The bonus features, though long, are quite interesting.  I've been a fan of his for years and knew some background on his oldest characters, but there was still a lot of information that was new, interesting and enjoyable to hear.  Overall, listening to Jeff discuss ""behind the scenes"" is entertaining.  This is a DVD that every fan of comedy must have.

I sit with family of all ages to watch this.  I like the fact that ( for the most part ) this is PG13 in my opinion.  I have a 9year old and he thinks Peanut is hiserical.  I like the old man and the jalipino.  There is something for everyone in this video.  Get it and play it in a room at Thanksgiving and Birthdays.  You will walk arouond the rest of the day quoting the caractors.  My son even wants to get a puppet of his own.  I wish I could see this in person.

I was thrilled when I happened to be flipping channels and saw his name in the channel guide on Comedy Central one weekend. After watching the show twice that weekend I went online and found that Amazon carried it on DVD. Since receiving the disc I have shown it to many friends and family members and they all agree he is the best they have ever saw. His interaction with the audience is another part that I thoroughly enjoy. If you have never seen Jeff work his magic do yourself a favor and order this disc and be prepared to laugh yourself silly. I hope Jeff will be around for years to come and will continue to release new material on DVD. I know I will be the first in line to add another disc to my collection.,1152748800,,884,4.145348837209302

A few years ago I saw Jeff perform in Branson, Missouri. I had never heard of him until that time, and thought his live act was hilarious. I've been looking for him ever since, and was glad to find this DVD.

Clocking in at around 90 minutes of nonstop hilarity with his puppets Walter, Sweet Daddy D, Bubba J, and of course everyone's favorite Peanut & Jose Jalapeno On A Stick.  The dvd includes outtakes which are just as funny as the show, 2 versions of the show (one censored and one not), and even for the first time on a comedy show: an audio commentary from Jeff and friend.  If you're looking for a way to spend 90 minutes laughing yourself to death, pick up this dvd.  Jeff Dunham is hillarious and after 5 minutes of watching it, you'll agree.",1152403200,,806,4.555555555555555

Dunham is funny, creative and his puppets are so believable you can actually suspend belief and think of them as people. Dunham's wit is great - even off the cuff things like when a member of the audience steps out on a call of nature - Dunham waits until he comes back to continue....

Besides, Jeff tackles EVERYONE in this performance:  Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Southerners, NASCAR fans, the elderly, the stupid, the deaf, the blind, and those with bladders too weak to sit through an entire show.  (Walter's ridicule of the guy sneaking out of the auditorium to go to the bathroom is priceless!)

We watched Jeff and his ""family"" on Comedy Central twice and right after watching him I went on Amazon and ordered the DVD. We have watched the DVD at least 3 times since we purchased it. There is a word of caution though, the unbleeped version can be a little bit much for the younger members of the family. The bleeped version is still pretty much a PG-13 or PG rating and it is not recommended for young children. Jeff and his family of characters will have you crying from laughing so hard that it makes your sides hurt and you can't breathe. Watch for ""Jose Jalapeno on a steeek"" and ""Peanut"" who puts him in the vegetable steamer instead of taking him to the spa.

A word of caution to parents, though: Jeff's characters look warm and fuzzy, and to be honest, compared to many contemporary comedians Jeff is really clean, but his stuff is NOT apporpriate for the youngest members of the family. True, there's a bleeped and non-bleeped version on this DVD, and the bleeped version is a definite R, but the non-bleeped version is still PG or PG-13. Just keep that in mind.

What it boils down to, is this (and its very simple): This is one of the funniest and most tallented stand-up acts I have ever seen. You have your all-time greats like Pryor and (fill in your fav here) but did they hold three-way conversations at lightning speed and legibly conveying three unique voices with three different personalities?

  I became a Fully devoted fan of Dunham and Walter when they

  made several tv appearances on TNN's early days when Ralph Emory (with Shotgun Red) were co-hosting Prime Time Country) and then later when Gary Chapman took over hosting duties.

  Jeff Dunham IS Hil-ARIOUS! and Walter has his own brand of

  (I'll run you down with my car) sense of skeptical humor about the insanities of the human condition.. you can't help but find yourself smiling as He ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

  MY total All out favorite on this program though was Peanut!

  Only once before have I laughed so hard I cried. (Robin Williams Live at the Met) was the other time. Talk about Side-splitting laughter! I laughed so hard at jeff's antics and interaction with Peanut (who accuses Jeff outright of selling his Crack)/however this is TOTALLY a *Family* funny show.

 Peanut seems like a schiztoid on speed--but in a good and Wildly funny way. (We should wonder why his nickname isn't ""Wild thang?"" Overall... I think anyone who wants a great laugh DEFINITELY SHOULD BUY THIS DVD. If there were More stars than 5 for the rating scale, I'd say ""Arguing with myself"" was Surely--

 OFF THE CHARTS HILARIOUS!",1145059200,9,1244,4.796208530805687
2494685,5,B000E5LEXS,"One of the biggest problems that I had watching this show on Comedy Central was that I laughed so hard I missed half of the jokes so I had to watch it over again! I first saw Jeff Dunham on one of the talk shows years ago and I remembered Jeff's 3 main stars, Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalepeno (On A Steek). I remember praying that I would get a chance to see this great ventriloquist again and finally my prayer's are answered. After years of getting laughs from vulgarity riddled standups from the likes of Red Foxx, Eddie Murphy, and Andrew Dice Clay, I finally can have a stand up comedy that is hilarious and I can watch with my children.
In this standup, Jeff introduces 2 new friends, Bubba J and Sweet Daddy Dee who are as funny as  the other 3. Bubba is a bucktoothed,beer belly redneck who is hysterically strereotyped as such, Sweet Daddy Dee is Jeffs new manager who insists he's Jeff's pimp. Though both new characters are hysterical, Walter (the grouchy old man) and Peanut (you would swear he's on speed), and Jose Jalapeno(On A Steek)are still my favorites. One of the greatest strengths of Jeff is his ability to bring forth totally different personalities as if 5 different comedians are voicing for each. Jeff jokes are funny and best of all, done in good taste.
All I can say to anyone who's not interested in this video is ""Your Loss"". These are 6 funny dudes you'll miss out on or is it 1 funny dude with 5 puppets?",1144886400,15,1437,4.422641509433962
