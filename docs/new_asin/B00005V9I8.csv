Every once in a rare while you find one with a simple plot, predictable happy ending that makes  you feel good inside.  Even though you have a pretty good idea of how it will end, we never cease to be amazed by the impact that some movies may have on us.  This one presents a strong, loving human side of our nature that rarely surfaces.  Kids come pretty close to presenting this higher side of ourselves.  Even though this movie is simple. It is one of those movies that that will always make you ""feel good"" inside, and enjoy watching many times over with family and friends.  This one is being added to my permanent collection !!

7956161,4,B00005V9I8,"As a family movie, I liked this quite a lot, as did my 9-year-old and my spouse.  I'm not quite sure why (I don't usually review movies), but to me the acting seemed so natural, easy, and convincing (especially the two girls, but really all the other characters, too).  There were a couple of points that seemed a little unrealistic, but I don't think that's too unusual in a family movie, and they weren't enough to bother me.

I recommend it -- very enjoyable.",1445817600,,462,4.476190476190476

I think all pre-teens should see it as it confirms that some of the dreams are what we really want but sometimes we have to try something else to confirm what we want.",1171411200,2,264,4.387755102040816

7956168,5,B00005V9I8,"This is a wonderful movie! No cussing, no nudity, no car chases, no explosions, not even a loud argument. Appropiate for anyone over 6 years old. Mischa Barton plays Frankie (Francheska), a 12 year old prima ballerina. Frankie has done ballet all her life, but walking through the park she sees a sign announcing baseball tryouts. Encouraged by her activist best friend and neighbor, Hazel, Frankie decides to go out for the team. She has to do this on the sly because her grandmother, whose thinking is in the victorian era, feels Frankie should live, breathe, and eat ballet. Frankie lives with her grandmother because she lost her parents when she was two. Frankie's grandmother hasn't finished grieving for her daughter, who also was a ballerina, and demands ballet from frankie because it's a way of closure for the severe emotional loss. The amusing subplot in this movie is the activist exploits of Hazel. Bothered by a library rarely open,  filthy parks, and ignored by the town's mayor, Hazel does her homework and discovers that there's no age set to run for mayor. Hazel announces her run, and quickly draws a following. The scene not to be missed is the mayoral debate where she hands the middle aged mayor his hat, metaphorically speaking. Any mother can put this vid on and know that their children will be inspired by Frankie and Hazel.",1075420800,7,1351,4.823275862068965
