8473728,2,B005HWAOAM,"I just watched this movie and to be honest, it left me disappointed. I'm going to try to explain why without giving out any major spoilers.
It start out decent enough. It raises a mystery and slowly reveals answers to the mystery and even manages to surprise you at times.

The characters start out rather interesting. My favorite was the hacker, Mio. She was pretty interesting and quirky. Then there was Myao a random woman who apparently knows martial arts that somehow got involved in all this when she tries to protect another girl named Yuko. Then there is the main character, Makino, who is super shy. She seems boring, but you expect her to open up at some point and break out of her shell and become more interesting. Well, she does a little. The character Kono, is a quiet mysterious guy that Makino likes. Why? I'm not sure. Then there is Yuki who is an artist and likes to draw cartoon/anime characters (called deformation characters in the movie).

Now the problems. This entire movie and the characters make absolutely no sense. And about half the character seem to be completely insane.

Let's start with the hacker character, Mio. As mentioned, Mio is pretty quirky. She's outgoing and very suspicious of the government. She uses her skills to remain unnoticed by those who monitor them. She's interesting enough, but with all her interesting characteristics, it has very little to do with what she is focused on through out the movie. For around half of the movie she focuses on trying to bring her group of ""friends"" together so they can practice a music video. What?! She has a plasma bomb in her house that she built so that she can blow up her house and probably the next few city blocks with it, and she is one of the most skilled hackers in the whole city, and all the story writers could come up with is, ""Let's have her obsess over a music video she really likes with her friends"". No! I don't want to know about the music video that she obsessed over. I want to know why she has a plasma bomb in her living room. There are so many questions raised by this character that simply aren't addressed.

Then there is Makino. She is a quiet girl with a communication impediment, and she has trouble opening up to people. She opens up a little, and that's it. The end. She has a crush on Kono for some reason even though she knows almost nothing about him. She has almost no purpose in the story and she does almost nothing but follow along. You think she'll open up at some point and see a bit of her personality, but no, that doesn't really happen. She is pretty much just a camera for the you to watch the story through from her point of view because she does almost nothing.

Next is Kono. This is the one of the few characters you actually learn something about. It's too bad he's an emotionless zombie who shows almost no emotion throughout the whole movie. As a result, he ended up being a rather boring character, until you find out a bit about him. His motivation for being involved in the story is slowly revealed throughout the movie. The only problem is that it makes no sense. The only way to stitch it all together in a manner that does make any sense is that he's insane because otherwise it all just nonsense. People, even quirky people, just don't behave like that.

Then there is Yuko. This character brings up some really odd questions about this dystopian future that are never answered. Apparently her art of drawing fictional chibi characters (referred to as deformation characters), is seen as very negative in their world. The movie never explains why. It just is. How can the writers leave out information about that as though this is normal. It doesn't make any sense, and therefore there must be a rather interesting cultural reason for this, but I guess we'll never know. Other than that, nothing else is revealed about this character.

Myao is pretty much a complete mystery, and nothing is revealed about her other than that she knows martial arts, she is always fighting people (for unstated reasons), and she may or may not be a person who isn't registered in the city's tracking system. She also seems to be somewhat shy. The reasons why for any of this is never stated. She might be trying to protect other unregistered people, which were mentioned for a couple minutes, and never mentioned again. Which is odd being that this seemed like a rather interesting plot point, but it was not developed just like that many other interesting possible plot points the come up in this movie.

Then there is the world itself. The place they live in was evidently created by a man named, Ishida. He evidently had some ideals (never revealed)  that he meant to found the city upon. He is responsible for creating the highly regulated and monitored society that the characters live in. This city is looked upon by the rest of the world as a utopia. It turns out that the whole mystery of this movie goes back to the origins of the city. Did I forget to mention that the founder was insane also? And evidently, all the security officers and detectives aren't much more sane either. This is also never explained.

This whole movie almost feels like it was made by an alien that had no understanding of how people actually work and only had a superficial understanding of human behavior. By the time you find out what it's all about, it just doesn't make any sense. There are so many plot holes and unanswered questions and character decisions, motivations, and actions that are just complete nonsense. By the end of the film, the most reasonable conclusion is that around half the characters must have been crazy and therefore, they didn't need a reason to do the crazy things they did.

This movie left me feeling like I had wasted over an hour of my life watching it. I gave this move two stars because at least the animation and artwork looked decent.

Also, a note to those who can translate the meaning of the title. This movie has nothing to do with wolves or anything like that. It's named Loups=Garous because one of the characters considers himself a lone wolf (at least I think that's why), and to be honest, he really is not much of a lone wolf.",1427760000,,6193,4.559352517985611
8473729,1,B005HWAOAM,"In a world where a virus claimed millions of lives, most now live in a complete online-existence for safety. One day a young girl decides to venture outside of the virtual world. While outside she meets a group of friends, as well as many dangers, including a killer who is violently, murdering children.

There was some good mystery and action at times (some bloody violence) but it was a pretty weird show altogether. It ended oddly. I expected the problems that the characters were having in the movie to be caused by something entirely different and more exciting. Even though I was surprised to find out what was really causing all the disappearances, I thought it was a lame cause. It felt like the story was awkward and the ending came up short in my mind even though I had no expectations of this movie before watching it. I was left with the feeling of disappointment and confusion. It was an unsatisfying anime movie. I suggest finding something else to watch.",1386892800,2,970,4.6725146198830405
8473730,4,B005HWAOAM,"I liked the movie.  The movie starts off with talk about some murders and also about these four students being put together in some group at some school.  The world they live in is like totally controlled by this company called SVC along with its CEO ... um... whose name I cannot right now remember... Anyway - the CEO/SVC is interesting. This company/CEO is seemingly omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent.

The movie starts out with a girl, Makino talking to her father through a computer screen. He apparently is rarely a part of her life. A bit later she is meeting up with her friends. She meets up with her friend Mio, this genius girl  who introduces her to Ayumi.  As the movie progress the story will shift from being about Makino initially to being more about the perplexing Ayumi. Ayumi, it turns out is the ... ahem ... guy that Makino has a crush on. Ayumi is sort of a quiet, contemplative, eccentric who has a sort of a Mersault-like perspective on life. (Um ... Anyone read Albert Camus' The Stranger?). By that I mean, Ayumi sees life as being basically meaningless and carries on in a stoic manner. In fact anytime trouble brews with some guy, Ayumi does not hesitate to really stick it to the guy and this very suddenly. Ayumi is this certain way on account of a certain past. So anyway these folks along with another gal, Myao, who is not a fellow student, take on a bunch of guys and I mean that literally. Okay, I won't say more. This is a very thoughtful movie and gives you a lot to think about.  You can really get involved in thinking about the characters long after the movie has ended. That's a sign of a good movie.

Now I gave this story 4 stars and not 5 because of some nits here and there. One set of nits has to do with some weak points in the storyline on occasion (e.g. Puki wanting to go home during the dead of the night when her life is in danger). IMO these are small nits however. Another issue was the actual animation itself. I would have liked for it to have been more stylized or something. I don't know, I feel the quality of the animation could have been upped more. Its not bad, but it could have been better. So 4.",1373155200,2,2165,4.344059405940594
8473731,3,B005HWAOAM,"I was looking at this for awhile. It doesn't exactly stand out.  Once you watch it(despite a major goof with Kono) Lopus=Garous is just as long a tale as it needs to be.  Since we're following the four characters each meeting a Character arc-type it doesn't flood you with information and tells just enough to move the story along.  The resolution to the mystery is the weakest part as the reasoning behind everything is tangentially connected to title. The viewpoint character is so subdued and usually only in a scene  so we can see her reaction.  The ""real"" Protagonist is on the cover, but you don't realize that until the movie is about half over.  worth a look if you can see definitely worth at least a rental.",1339977600,5,717,4.5625
8473732,2,B005HWAOAM,"Imagine a world in which a virus did so much damage to society that the new world has decided it's best to keep people isolated in cities. As a result people rarely go out and communicate through virtual realities and the like. An intriguing idea but the info dumps early on were horribly executed and some of the characters were peculiar and just boring. After twenty minutes it was time to turn it off and no I'm not one of those people who believes you need to watch the whole thing before calling it a dud.

OVERALL GRADE: C.",1335744000,4,529,4.343434343434343
8473733,4,B005HWAOAM,"I've been wanting this bleeping thing ever since I saw the ad for it in Otaku USA. My father pointed it out in F.Y.E yesterday and I threw it in the cart for an ultimate impulse buy. On the way home I watched it (most of it) was captivated and yet annoyed by the fact that Kono looks like a girl and we all know it!!! The whole thing kept me smiling. I loved it, and I still do, the only thing I point it down for are the cheesy lines and a few other important things which you will see if you watch it :3
I loved the art style, it was a change and a good one for me.
The story is neat and at first it kind of threw me for a loop, I'm not some crazy vamp/werewolf fangirl, the title is a lie, it's not about WEREWOLVES!!! I promise.
The entire thing is lovely, just pick it up and give it a try, besides a few annoying voices here and there, the title is neat and I really liked it. I just can't wait to show it to my friends ^^, wish I would have bought it on Blue Ray.
Update:
Yes Kono was suppose to be a girl, he wears a skirt and if you change the language to Japanese he has -gasp- a girls voice.",1323561600,13,1102,3.774891774891775
