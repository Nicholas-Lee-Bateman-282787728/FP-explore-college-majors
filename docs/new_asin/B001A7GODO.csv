3445881,4,B001A7GODO,"This film is worth the wait, if only for Alan Rickman scene with the bosses chair!  I hated the 'jump cuts' and at first thought there was something wrong with my copy, but other than that, a film to make you smile.  enjoy!",1216512000,3,223,4.162790697674419
3445882,5,B001A7GODO,"The premise of this film is that business is the new American battleground--a sentiment that was unfortunately undone by the events of 9/11.  It remains, however, deliciously funny.  Alan Rickman's comic timing is exquisite.  The dancing that takes place under the closing credits alone is well worth the price of the DVD.  This has been available for more than a year--as I recall--at Mike Binder's site.  It's nice to see Amazon (Seattle's own!) finally offering it.  A gem of a film.",1216080000,12,486,4.938271604938271
3445883,5,B001A7GODO,"I got my copy awhile back and I must say that this movie was worth the wait. Binder is a great writer and director, but Alan Rickman is what made the movie. Every scene he was in I laughed. I wouldn't say this movie is award winning but it will put a smile on your face and keep you entertained.",1213574400,6,295,3.933333333333333
3445884,5,B001A7GODO,Alan Rickman is funny as hell as a British business man doing whatever he can to prevent an American equal from looking good & taking his job! Great supporting cast....laugh a minute!!,1316822400,2,184,4.78125
3445885,5,B001A7GODO,I am a HUGE Alan Rickman fan. I have honestly watched everything he was ever in and I have to say this film is absolutely the best. Not only do you get your fix of the ever sexy Alan Rickman you will be laughing your butt off. It's Rickman in a whole new light. I HIGHLY recommend this film. I loved it so much that after forcing my roommates to watch it with me three of them purchased it for their own collection.,1301616000,4,415,4.0120481927710845
3445886,3,B001A7GODO,"Matthew Barnes (Mike Binder) and his wife (Janeane Garofalo) have just arrived in London, where he is to finalize an important merger for his company, but from the moment they step off the plane, everything goes wrong.  John Gissing (Alan Rickman), his company contact, was supposed to arrange a driver, a suite, and a bank account, but none of it has materialized and Gissing himself is missing.  The only one who wants to help is a very unusual nun.

The first half of this movie is laugh-out-loud funny with madcap misadventures reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Out-of-Towners/dp/B0000AUHQ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Out-of-Towners</a>&nbsp;with a bit of a mystery as well.  Writer/director/star Binder is quite likable as the Everyman/Underdog hero, but he looks and acts so much like Ben Stiller than I kept wishing they'd just hired Stiller instead.  Garofalo is her usual wise-cracking persona and is very funny.  Alan Rickman isn't on-screen nearly enough, but his scenes are the best.

The second half bogs down into an endless discussion of Matthew's Merger/Acquisition/Big Deal and I found it confusing and tedious.  This is supposed to be an office farce about jealousy and climbing the corporate ladder at all costs, but the last hour was dull and relied too much on silly slapstick humor.

Recommended if you're an Alan Rickman fan or have nothing better to watch.",1281744000,,1444,5.557077625570776
3445887,5,B001A7GODO,"This is a film that just plain sneaks up on you!  It's packaged so generically, and outwardly seems, at best, nondescript - but that's so misleading.  This film is ""funny""!  It's clever and very entertaining right down to the last moment.

Mr. Alan Rickman is at his best in this film, complete with his almost ""signature"" moment of making the audience ""cring"" by doing something ""untoward""!  But, then, that's the pleasure of watching Mr. Rickman - we seldom can guess where he'll go and what he'll do when he gets there?  Yes, my copy had worn sections where I've played and replayed certain scenes - they are just unbelievable!

If you need a humorous ""feel good"" movie to curl up with, I'd certainly recommend this one - ah, for mature audiences.  It does get a little risqu.",1277424000,4,779,4.635036496350365
3445888,5,B001A7GODO,This is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to anyone who is an Alan Rickman fan!  He did a wonderful job and was very funny!,1272844800,2,132,3.888888888888889
3445889,4,B001A7GODO,I liked this film except for certain expletives which came up from time to time.  It was well cast and had an especially funny ending. Alan Rickman was at his devilish best and Janeane Garafalo was funny (as usual). I wouldn't take a child or teenager to see this film as it has some scenes and language which might be objectable. I enjoy British humor so this was a good movie for me.,1266364800,2,385,4.273972602739726
3445890,1,B001A7GODO,"If you are considering adding this film to your Alan Rickman collection, don't bother.  Rickman's performance is nice, but the film is so overwhelmingly dull that you will simply end up fast forwarding to the Rickman bits.  I can't imagine who thought this script was worth making.",1252540800,3,281,4.957446808510638
3445891,5,B001A7GODO,"A very clever, witty script and excellent performances make this a film well worth watching.

The plot focuses on an American businessman who is sent to London to lead a European business merger, and his British counterpart, who has been passed over for the job.  Played by the brilliant Alan Rickman, the British character devises all kinds of schemes and foils  to undermine and demolish his American competition.  The American figures out the schemes and retaliates with an eye for an eye, and it is very funny.

This is a perfect movie for a light hearted escape.  Should have received more attention when it first came out.",1245196800,3,628,4.822429906542056
3445892,5,B001A7GODO,"This movie was absolutely wonderful!!!!  This was almost like a British version of Office Space - except funnier, in that the humor was more highly developed.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Office Space, but this movie has a drier sense of humor about it, which is more along the lines of the humor I love. If you are a fan of British humor, you will love this movie!  For anyone who has ever worked in an office and been made to suffer corporate arrogance and stupidity, this film might give you a few ideas about how to overcome such obstacles, and possibly subvert the system.  Personally, this movie had me laughing out loud until I was in pain in places.

Alan Rickman is excellent in this film - I would say the most comical that I have seen him, and that is saying something.  His humor is in that he can play a character that isn't trying to be funny for humor's sake, but rather that his machinations place him in almost absurd situations, and that, in my opinion, is the best kind of humor.  If you are even a fraction of the Alan Rickman fan that I am, then you will LOVE this movie.  Also, be certain to watch the outtakes and deleted scenes, for they are equally amusing.

All in all, I was completely stunned that a film this wonderful never seemed to make it into the American radar for film.  But in someways this is a good thing because this movie does not sacrifice its characters to Hollywood glitz.  This is a very character driven film amuses from the first scene right up to the end.  I can't even begin to verbalize how good it was!  Were I to fill my review with nothing but exclamation points, it would not fully convey my enthusiasm about this movie!!!!!!",1237766400,3,1679,4.360128617363344
3445893,5,B001A7GODO,"The movie as a whole sometimes moves a bit slow, but it is well worth it if you are an Alan Rickman fan.  Quite a departure from his bad guy/romantic guy roles.  His comic timing and deadpan delivery had me howling at times...while the physical comedy was just plain funny. Worth the money to see him in such a different incarnation.  The deleted scenes/outtakes are priceless, and I agree with the others the dance scene over the credits is both sweet and funny.",1236556800,2,463,4.554216867469879
3445894,3,B001A7GODO,"This movie has the fatal stench of ""vanity project."" To be an ambitious actor of unknown quality is to be an actor who has to write a movie for himself, then has to direct it so he can cast himself. Mike Binder is the actor/writer/director who knitted this series of cliches and old Neil Simon together as a gift to his own career. No one told him that ""The Out of Towners"" had been made some 30 years ago, and even the much, much more likable and talented Jack Lemmon couldn't make its irritating plot tolerable. No one told Mike Binder that there is only gonna be one Ben Stiller. So hopeful he is to be Ben Stiller that he even fetched one of Ben Stiller's former company members, Janeane Garafolo, to play his wife. As the wife, she gets to complain a lot, follow her man from port to port while having no other wish for herself than to settle down and give birth to his children. When you write your own husband role, you get to make yourself a wife like that-- one who's nearly as focused on you as you are.

The writing and directing are uninspired and often lazy. Mike Binder's acting, that present he created for himself, is indeed a watered down Stiller imitation. Unlike his role model, he does run around a lot, which seems to be his acting shorthand for funny. There's his writer/director mediocre attempt to make secondary characters lovably kooky, but by golly, they are poorly realized, never engaging or endearing, just thrown in because, hey, that's what Ben Stiller would do. Mike Binder doesn't seem to have the skill set to make what he's attempting work, hard as he tries to mimic other well-worn comic formulas.

Binder's more self-brutalizing mistake is one even actor/writer/director Kevin Costner made-- allowing himself to be measured against Alan Rickman. Again, why didn't anyone tell him? You cannot out perform Alan Rickman. Rickman is lightly used in the first half of the movie, then dominates the last half. He seems to relish his chance at screwball comedy, and he plays what he's given with deft delight. Although he is the root of all the Binder character's frustrations, Rickman's John Gissing is still the most engagingly appealing character of the bunch.  It's a relief when John Gissing is finally found and begins to occupy real screen time.

While Alan Rickman consistently out classes Mike Binder's performance, God bless Alan Rickman's involvement. Without his name on the credits, no one would have sought this movie out. It would have remained with the other vanity projects of needy actors turned writer/directors. Gone. Forgotten-- just the source of the faint sour smell of desperately failed self-promotion wafting up from the bottom of the clearance bin at Blockbusters.",1235174400,20,2722,4.80982905982906
3445895,5,B001A7GODO,...This film will make a good addition to your collection. ALAN RICKMAN is generally known for his roles in Die Hard (Hans Gruber) and Harry Potter (Professor Severus Snape). To REAL admirers this film showcases his versitility and approach to unseemly characters. John Gissing is a selfish sod that I bounced back & forth between hating and loving. Hope you do too! Make sure you view the dance sequence at the end of the film. It looks like they had a lot of fun working this project!,1232323200,2,486,4.597701149425287
3445896,5,B001A7GODO,"It is a pity that this movie has not been given a cinematic release. But now we can be grateful it has found its way to DVD.

This is a very funny movie that allows the star of the show Alan Rickman to show his considerable comic qualities. For those who only think of him as a movie villain, this movie must come as a real eye-opener. As a very versatile actor who is excellent doing all kinds of characters, he is truly outstanding as John Gissing. One should be a little careful with spoilers, but e.g. the business with the chair and a word rhyming with Gissing is hilarious. Also great footwork during the credits!

The rest of the cast provide great performances, too, so it all adds up to a great evening in watching this movie.

A generous amount of deleted scenes, rounds it all up perfectly. Only wish some of them could have been edited into the movie.

So what are you waiting for - this DVD is a must have.",1229385600,4,919,4.264367816091954
3445897,1,B001A7GODO,"I too got this film to add to my growing collection of Alan Rickman films and was sadly disappointed.  I found Mike Binder to be annoying and ridiculous beyond measure and the absolute implausibility of the storyline caused me to roll my eyes so many times I had a headache by the end of the movie!  The whole nun thing was awful.  And as has been said before in other reviews here, the likes of Janeane Garofalo and Juliet Stevenson are wasted.

Oddly enough, despite my negative impression of the film as a whole, I have a great desire to see Alan Rickman do more comedy.  I adore him in his dramatic roles but he has a gift for symphonic sarcasm that keeps me wanting more.  Who knows, however, why he chose this project.  I sincerely hope some smartly written comedies (let me stress this again, this was not smartly or even well written) come his way.",1228953600,28,856,4.414012738853503
3445898,2,B001A7GODO,"This film is a very disappointing outing.  It's a rather contrived, badly plotted film about a corporate manager who is transferred to London to oversee a merger, and gets the shaft by the title character.  While there are a few funny passages in the film, there are a lot of very dull stretches.  Most of the dialogue is expository, resulting in a film with absolutely no narrative flow.  It plods from one setpiece to another, and ends up being an absolute chore to finish.  Much of the slapstick quality of it feels forced, and it feels like a sitcom where logic and character development go straight out the window.  The character's motivation make little to no sense at all.  It's one of the most paper thin scripts I've ever seen in a movie.

There are some good things about it.  It has an excellent cast.  Alan Rickman is good as usual, and Janeane Garofalo is very good here, despite her character being underwritten.  It's nice to see her play a relatively normal person here instead of the dumpy romantic lead or the sarcastic chick.  Her character here has some sarcastic dialogue, but there's some tenderness there as well, a side she rarely shows in her work.  Mike Binder wrote, directed, and stars in the film, and has good screen presence and good chemistry with Garofalo.  His writing, however, is very poor and the flashy direction is annoying.  The flashy direction seems to be compensating for the fact that the source material is so flimsy to being with.  Juliet Stevenson, Allan Courdiner, and Nigel Terry (all excellent actors) are wasted in roles that end up being caricatures, and there's a silly plot involving a fake nun.  The film never got a release stateside, and only recently got released to DVD.  It's easy to see why.",1228262400,12,1752,4.707236842105263
3445899,1,B001A7GODO,I have no way of knowing about this product. The seller did not ship nor return 3 E-Mails. Got a refund. Amazon should conduct an investigation of  this seller based on the amount of negatives listed.,1223337600,,200,4.555555555555555
3445900,5,B001A7GODO,It's a very funny movie. Alan Rickman is really the better and shows all his talent in this film. Happyness!,1221264000,3,108,4.45
3445901,5,B001A7GODO,This is a wonderful movie for any Alan Rickman fan. This is an extremely funny movie. I laughed so hard at the intelligent wit and complete humor of the movie.,1220745600,2,159,4.333333333333333
3445902,4,B001A7GODO,"I got my copy when it was first available thru the film maker.  It's funny -- often hysterically so.  That said, I could have lived without the massive amounts of profanity.  My favourite scene is when Gissing (Rickman's character) is minus his glasses and trying to make a big presentation.  He is sandbagged in spades by the man he sandbagged earlier.  When they finally join forces, stand by for more laughs at the expense of the stuff-shirted ""boss,"" come to town to take over.

As other reviews have indicated, it's Rickman who steals the show (as usual in his films).  In comedy, it's all about timing; and Rickman is as good as George Burns!",1220140800,2,648,4.631578947368421
3445903,5,B001A7GODO,"I paid an arm and a leg to get this movie to add to my Rickman collection before it was widely available, and it was worth it.  Alan Rickman has described himself an instrument.  He is most known for ""playing that instrument"" as a heavy, and even as a romatic lead.  He does each brilliantly.  But in Gissing, he proves that he also has perfect comic timing.  The movie is a little choppy in its transition editing, perhaps because someone thought this was creative.  It is not.  However Alan Rickman's performance is incredible.  If you are a Rickman fan, you absolutely must own this.  If your don't know much about him (where HAVE you been?), you will be a fan when you see this.",1218067200,33,682,4.435483870967742

8276279,3,B001A7GODO,"While I didn't particularly cared for some of the characters, I thought Alan Rickman was hillarious in this. I bought this movie to add to my Alan Rickman collection, so it's not a complete waste since I liked him. It's something slightly out of character from most movies he's in, since he's funny and not the 'bad guy' which I liked. You can see how good of an actor he is. Unfortunately, his performance is diminished somewhat because the other main cast aren't that great.",1420675200,,476,4.6117647058823525

8276281,4,B001A7GODO,"A corporate memo accidentally falls into the hands of John Gissing.  It divulges the intention of the CEO to replace Gissing (played with finesse by Alan Rickman) with Matthew Barnes from the USA.  Thus begins a comedy of ""war"" between the two for the position. When Barnes and his wife arrive in England,  Gissing screws up Barne's credit cards, his hotel reservations, important meeting times and, once Barnes catches on to what is happening, he plays dirty right back.  Matthew Barnes is played by Mike Binder who wrote and directed, as well as starred in, The Search for John Gissing.  Janeane Garofalo plays Matthew's wife, Linda, with gusto.

Have patience because you don't get to see much of the exquisite Alan Rickman in the first half of the movie, but he more than makes up for it in the second half!  Laugh out loud funny!  If you are an Alan Rickman fan, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!",1382227200,2,895,4.620253164556962
