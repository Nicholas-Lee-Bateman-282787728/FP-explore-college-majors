187348,2,0790740672,"Ok, I like George Burns's first ""Oh God"" film. ""Oh God Two"" was lumpy weak sequel. I expected George Burns playing both God and the Devil would be interesating...It's Hell to swallow!

A young boy's father is asked GOD to watch over him...God says I hope he (the boy) isn't another disappointment (Foreshadowing what going to happen to the max)

The boy grows up into Ted Wass character, Billy Shelton-a Struggling musician who career is floundering and says ""I would sell my very soul to the devil to make it"". (Can you say WRONG ANSWER!)

He is visited by Harry Tophet (the devil) and made an offer he can't refuse. He signed the satin pact. Shelton  takes over Billy Wayne, a rock star the devil recently just took his soul

Shelton sees his wife with another man. He finds out she is pregnant  and wants to get out of the contract. The Devil says NO (cmon there would be no movie is he said yes). So Shelton keeps search for GOD

A holy man says GOD is in the desert. Where else would a rock star go to the desert...Las Vegas. This is where GOD and the Devil having a showdown playing poker. A rotoscoping nightmare since one or the other Burns look like he's taped.

I would have wanted more interplay between God and the Devil(THE SHOWDOWN WAS TOO SHORT)instead of a FAUST-like tale. It is a cute film, like too much sweet candy after Halloween

If you are a George Burns fan, its OKAY--I'd rather watch ""Going in Style"" with Burns and Art Carney

187349,5,0790740672,"A little comedic gem. This third installment of the ""Oh,God!"" series stands on it's own. Several scenes of hilarity are woven with thought provoking ideals. George Burns is in fine form in both roles. His Harry O. Tophet is a scream. Another fine turn by the underrated Ted Wass. An actor who has the knack for comedy, slapstick, and drama.

187364,2,0790740672,"Ugh. G'bye, 90 minutes, I won't be getting you back. In watching Oh, God! You Devil I got a whiff of what eternal damnation must feel like. This stinker came out in 1984 and is the third and final installment in the film franchise, and I sense last legs here. I see the high ratings on Amazon, and I am baffled. This movie sticks us with a dull, drab Los Angelino, a singer/songwriter (Ted Wass) desperate to make it in the music industry and so sells his soul to the Devil. Enter sly old theatrical agent Harry O. Tophet (George Burns) who convinces our wet blanket to sign a contract on a trial basis (**wink, wink**). Harry O. Tophet is, of course, Old Scratch himself, and he never, ever plays fair. He grants our wet blanket's fervent wish, yeah, but in messed-up fashion. He puts our guy's mind into the body of a renowned rock star, and puts the rock star's mind into our guy's body. So here's our wet blanket living the wild life, basking in the adoration, rolling with the perks. I think it's a knock against him that it takes a long minute before he begins missing his wife. When he finally calls her up is when he realizes that someone else (Robert Desiderio) is now living his old life, keeping company with his pregnant wife (Roxanne Hart). And she thinks it's still him. Boy, that Harry O. Tophet sure is a mean prankster. But I can't sympathize with our protagonist.

There is a side street in cinemaland devoted to the premise of the human outfoxing the Devil. Off the top of my head, I recall&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Daniel-Webster-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0000AKY54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil & Daniel Webster (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;(1941),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-on-My-Shoulder/dp/6305986975/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel on My Shoulder</a>&nbsp;(1946), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witches-of-Eastwick-Keepcase/dp/B000FFJYBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witches of Eastwick (Keepcase)</a>&nbsp;(1987), three movies that leave this one in the dust. Oh, God! You Devil was a chore to sit thru. Not even George Burns in a dual role elevates it. At this stage, as the trilogy gets capped, it feels sad and tired and flat. The storytelling is weak and flimsy and it drags. My main contention is the lead character who is dull and unlikable. He's such a sad sack that even when he does achieve decadent rock & roll status, guy can't even enjoy it. It's constant doom and gloom for our guy. I know George Burns was old and creaky and couldn't shoulder the brunt of screen time, but I desperately craved more of him, less of Ted Wass.

Give Burns credit; he's still spry even as he dodders along. When he's playing the demonic talent agent, he comes across as less sanctimonious, less saccharine. He acquires this wicked gleam in his eye. But whichever drip wrote the screenplay doesn't make the Devil nasty enough, diabolical enough - and, yes, I acknowledge that this is a comedy so maybe you can't get too crazy. And yet when Jack Nicholson played Old Nick in The Witches of Eastwick, there was an alarming edge to him, and that movie was a very successful comedy.

To sum up, I liked the bits with George Burns as the Man Upstairs, and loved the bits with the Devil more. His timing and deadpan delivery were on point all the way to the end. I love it that the Almighty and the Devil resort to a game of poker in Vegas to settle who snags our guy's soul. And, as a forever fan of Guys and Dolls, it's sweet to hear the strains of ""Fugue For Tinhorns,"" which starts and ends the movie. (""I got the horse riiiiight here!"")

And, okay, my good pal Wiki just told me that the screenwriter is Andrew Bergman, who wrote two much more hilarious films in Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws. This actually cheeses me off even more, because Bergman's pedigree suggests he should've done better writing this thing. I think I'll go hunt up a movie that's more uplifting to watch. The Passion of the Christ, anyone?",1460505600,,4120,5.117384843982169

I highly recommend this as a good family film that you could watch on family film night for a fun time.

The movie will have you crying at the end, but it will be happy tears. Like the other Oh God movies, ""Oh God! You Devil"" carries a strong message. Perhaps the strongest of all of them.

Does this man, get out of his agreement with the devil?  You'll only know, if you watch the movie.  One actor plays God, the other plays the devil.  If you liked the other Oh God movies, about an actor who plays God, you'll find this even more interesting with the devil.",1365465600,,680,4.21875

This plot has everything: Humor touching spots and many twists and turns that provoke thought about what our priorities in life should be. there was much thought put into this story which is rare in modern films.
