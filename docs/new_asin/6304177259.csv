802981,4,6304177259,"I saw this movie at a point in my life when I was absolutely fed up with big-budget Hollywood movies and was looking for something...different. And this movie definitely qualifies as different. It's intelligent political  humor and its not-so-subtle commentary on the effects of youthful idealism  are actually entertaining rather than tiresome and preachy. Even the overly  simplistic representation of the tomatoes for blood, which is most apparent  when you see the clear tomato-filled jars lining the shelves, didn't feel  like a glaring attempt at cinematic sophistication, but is instead realized  and relished. This movie is a welcomed break from the cliched explosive  action flicks and ho-hum romantic comedies appearing so frequently on the  big screen. It would appeal to anyone who can think of a few people this  world could do better without...and we all can name a few, right?",956707200,14,891,5.26241134751773

803127,5,6304177259,"Were we to examine history's roster of spectacular evil (holocausts, genocides, revolutions, inquisitions, witch burnings, etc., etc., etc.) we would find that they are almost never executed mainly by sadists, psychopaths, or maniacs. That's because real sadists, psychopaths, and maniacs are too few in number to achieve these large outcomes by themselves. (For example, the DSM IV estimates that, in our nation of three hundred million, the number of serial killers is only a few dozen.) The large scale of such evil requires the active agency of large numbers of perpetrators, most of whom are ordinary and ordinarily ""normal"" people.

The merit of this film is that it depicts the underlying foundations of most spectacular evil: Decisions by ""normal"" persons with a vision of the ""good"" to achieve their understanding of the greater good by morally compromised means: beginning with small scale acts of evil in the name of the greater good. The classic assertion that, ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"" is excellently depicted. The first step is the most difficult. Those which follow come ever more easily.

This film does an excellent job of depicting this process, and the existential corrosion that follows from it. This depiction is embroidered by its biblical ties (the protagonists bearing such names as Luke, Mark, John, Paul, Jude), allegorical depictions, (i.e., the ever more bountiful evil fruit of their works), the almost Dorian Grey character of their descent into caricatures of the seven deadly sins), the eventual triumph of an antichrist).

At base, The Last Supper provides an excellent critique of the fallacies of Devil Theory. A serious film cloaked in unserious garb.",1415836800,,1711,5.237226277372263

803184,5,6304177259,"I've long wanted to see Ron Perlman -- clearly a guy of many talents and high intelligence -- play a normal guy.  Rarely does he get those roles.  I was first entranced with him as the sheriff in 'Desperation', though surely I'd seen him in film before that, but didn't specifically remember where.  He OWNED that role in Desperation, made the film as haunting as the book, which is by far the scariest book I've ever read.

Came to find out, Perlman owns every role he plays, so I wanted to see this film.  Turns out, everyone in this film did a fabulous job, from script to scene shooting to film editing, and if you even miss a minute, you'll miss the film flow.  What's the story?  Well, you can find that, from the other reviews.  Point is, if you don't watch this film, you'll regret it.  If you have strong political views, you might find the film uncomfortable.  If you're a fundamentalist Christian and don't watch the film, you'll never see yourself as others see us, and never grow up in Christ.

God is not a bigot, not out to kill dissent, but we make him out to be as petty and clueless about grace as we are.  So we play God, Christian or no.. and we become the characters in the film.  Ooops.

Film editing and shooting of the scene angles is superb.  This should be a stage play first; somehow the camera direction managed to bridge the gap between stage and film.  Absolutely perfect.",1401062400,,1402,4.396887159533074

803189,5,6304177259,"The Last Supper is a pretty funny dark comedy.  It's about a group of grad students that invite people over to their homes to have late night discussion groups around the dinner table.  They cover all the important subjects such as sex and war.  When one unstable and untrustworthy man comes over and basically compliments H*tler and supports everything that any sensible person would never support in a million zillion years, the grad students obviously take exception to this.

Soon after, the man grabs one of the grad students and holds a knife up to his throat.  It's obvious that the man is crazy so the other grad students stab him in the back resulting in the man falling over and dying.  The students begin to panic and worry with the normal questions you'd expect after someone just commits a murder. ""What do we do!  We need to call the cops!"" but instead, since the man was apparently a truck driver, they believe nobody will suspect a thing.

From here, the grad students basically get off on killing the people they invite over for their thought-provoking discussions, and come up with this idea to provide them with poisonous wine.  When a preacher comes over and basically says that man on man action is wrong and that these men should all be shipped to a deserted island where they will eventually die off, this becomes the first of many killings a result of the grad students believing these are bad, hateful people that will only end up having a negative impact on the world.  More like a humongous overraction, but okay!

These grad students constantly come up with hypothetical questions such as ""It's Austria, 1909, and you have the opportunity to kill H*tler.  Would you do it knowing what he was going to do?""  Of course the answer here is, only unless we're 100% sure we *know* what he's going to do.  Simply transporting back in time and killing a powerful leader without any confirmation he's going to end up killing 6 million Jews would make *you* look like the bad person, right?  After all, just bumping into him or anyone for that matter may significantly alter the future.  It may alter it enough to assure that our parents wouldn't have met and we wouldn't even be here right now.  Then again it may have been worth it, if it saves 6 million people.  Okay okay, these *are* good questions.

Anyway all the people that are killed are dumped in the back yard with tomato plants growing on top of them as a way to cover the evidence.  A cop eventually catches onto these students.  Interesting a song that plays called ""Wicked Rain"" by a band called Los Lobos plays later- it totally reminds me of Blue Oyster Cult and I was almost 100% confident it WAS them but a google search reveals that no, it's not.

It's honestly a pretty funny movie.  You have to NOT be offended by people dying in a nonchalant way like it's no big deal to probably really appreciate the type of comedy this is going for.  It's probably an ideal movie for those that just want to punch and kick those we disagree with, but of course, that would be illegal so we can't!

A part of me believes that if all the negativity and stubbornness to respect other point of views from internet message boards ever became part of real-life discussions, something like *this* might occur!  I kid I kid!  I think. :)",1374969600,,3307,4.561016949152543

803191,1,6304177259,"Within the first five minutes of the film, one instantly grasps the extreme liberal political message Dan Rosen wrote into this very unfunny, sophomoric movie. The question here is where is the dividing line between creativity and apparent psychological derangement? Here's the point: It was once cool to show you were a non-conformist by rebelling against the establishment. Now, the establishment is everything that this movie represents. The movie title is only one of at least three mockeries of religious principles that show up within the first ten minutes of the film. The movie opens with an obvious parody of Rush Limbaugh, then the ""intelligentsia"" (portrayed by Cameron Diaz, go figure, and the other less hot actors) encounters a chance dinner guest who says Grace before eating, and then tells them that he was a veteran of Desert Storm, just before (and conveniently for the story line) revealing himself as a neo-fascist, bigoted, anti-Semitic knife-wielding murderer.  I saw this less as a movie plot than a script-writers literary wet political dream. This is writing in its most transparently sophomoric fashion. Save your money and avoid this film. If you're anything but extremely liberal, this film will disgust you within the first few minutes and even if you are extremely liberal, there are many other venues to catch much more clever applications of this movie's prime message which is Liberal/Good -- Conservative/Bad.",1373068800,2,1444,5.251082251082251
803192,2,6304177259,I just did not like the movie.  I do not like movies where people go around killing others just because they do not like their views on life.  The movie was just too complicated.,1369785600,2,178,4.205882352941177
803254,5,6304177259,"I thought this movie was funny and cute with interesting characters, an unusual plot, some dark humor, lots of cameos and a great final twist at the end. It should appeal to anyone from their teens on up to grown adults- as long as they can appreciate some dark humor. Cameron Diaz did some interesting indie flicks with dark humor such as Very Bad Things, Being John Malkovich and this one among others. All the cast are funny as they try to cope with weeding out society's ""bad seeds"" giving them a last supper and trying to convince them to change their views or suffer death for their usually conservative beliefs. The movie's premise is that old philosophical question: if you met Hitler as a young boy, knowing you could alter the course of history and presumably save millions of innocent lives, would you kill him? This group of liberal Mid-Western grad students starts taking action against society's villains as they see them so they can feel like they are really contributing to making the world a better place instead of just talking about it. But they end up biting off more than they can chew when a local sheriff starts to suspect something... This movie is definitely a dark comedy but great fun.

803257,4,6304177259,"This movie progressed far differently than I expected. Based on the reviews, I thought it would be a silly murder flick along the same line as ""Clue."" Then when I started watching it, I thought it was just going to insult conservatives for the next hour and a half. Mistaken, on both counts. It ended up being an increasingly serious commentary on the dangers of polarized world views and how even the best of intentions may do more harm than good. Still, there are some laughs, but I wouldn't really call this movie a comedy.",1302566400,3,526,4.5473684210526315
803258,2,6304177259,"I love cheap movies on VHS.  So I didn't have high hopes for this movie, and I wasn't dissapointed.  Quick plot summary--a group of liberals who dine together invite a guest every week (or something like that) until they invite truck driver Bill Paxton.  Being a right-winger, this guy starts a fight, is killed at the dinner table, and the merry group decides it's for the best and then comes up with an idea--why not continue the weekly dinners, invite those of the right-wing and then poison them.  It's a good idea for a movie, and it has some potential philosophical questions, but you won't find much worth seeing here.  The story is very standard and predictable.  They kill ""undesireables"" until some of them start experiencing guilt and suddenly we are thrown into a Dostoyevsky-like senario much like ""Crime and Punishment.""

But unlike Dostoyevsky, there is no moment of truth.  Instead the group finds it's one last victim, this guy who is like Rush Limbaugh, and decides to provide a great service to humanity by killing this hate monger.  I'll leave it there.  Fact is, all the characters are pretty one dimensional, and their developement is very base.  None of them are in the least bit likeable or interesting, and really, I watched this hoping something interesting would happen, like Alice Cooper shows up all pissed off or something.  Every time the movie tries to get some deep point across, it just comes off of trivial and lame.  I did like Bill paxton, and I read one review in which I totally agree with--watch the first 10 minutes with Paxton, then shut it off.  Annabeth Gish was good, too, but I always like her in whatever she does.

I gave this movie 2 stars because it is watchable, it's just not very good and I won't be watching it ever again. If you got nothing else to watch, go ahead and give it a try, it's worth your time, but you won't be bragging about it the next day.",1292976000,,1909,4.589970501474927

803263,3,6304177259,"The Last Supper (1995) is a  Cognac's Police Festival prizewinner
with a story that is realistic, portraying the politicized minds of
some college and graduate-school aged individuals - not paying
taxes, and not having to answer to a boss - their only  concern
being of a single feeling, thought and opinion, collectively in
agreement about various news of the day.

With enormous time on their hands, and pleasure in discussing their
studies and hobbies, the 5 individuals get together weekly, and at
one point, decide to become political vigilantes, or judge, jury and
executioners of guests invited over for dinner, officially hoping
the latter are amenable in  changing their political stances over
the course of a meal.

The film is wide-screen, with some pop music mixed in between, the
story well edited, and laid out, reminiscent somewhat of Stephen
King's novels. This is the case  from the horror mixed into the main
story, and given a lackadaisical treatment.

Interestingly, the political clique's original appraoch of patience,
and a fair and balanced approach to the dinner guests morphes into a
pedal-to-the-metal expediency in purging the town from some of its
most outspoken citizens, proponents of traditional values.

They are all-American individuals, played by Cameron Diaz, Ron
Eldard, Annabeth Gish,  Jonathan Penner,  Courtney Vance, Bill
Paxton and  Jonathan Penner, with a fine acting, often amusing,
charming even, while at the same time, mature and serious as a
litany of discussions ensue weighing in on the face of their guests.

Some issues covered by guests are as patriotism, the military,
taxation, the costs of leadership, the HIV virus and the community
most affected, euthanasia, misogyny and chauvinism, abortion,
America's Baptist, Evangelical and Protestant churches,
homelessness, Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution, global warming,
species in danger of extinction, mensa,  birth control, family
values, sex education in schools, scripture, etc.

The clan later unknowingly submits to a test of character and
objectivity in face of a tele-evangelist met at an airport, who they
considered their nemesis. Hearing his ideas and businessman
explanations, the group try hard to restrain their subjective and
pre-conceived ideas based on earlier TV programming watched, and
their pavlovian reactions.

In the meantime, the town's law enforcement conducts an
investigation over a number of disappearances in the area, while
strife and rifts open up between members, as more and more guests
are accepted.

In sum, the film may be underestimated in its simplicity, TV actors
and macabre running theme, but this film definitely deserves to be
seen. It's a wake  up call in some ways to political awareness by
those who often can't wrap their minds around political stories in
the media, or ignore those.",1265587200,3,2837,5.367945823927765
803353,5,6304177259,"Director Stacy Title and screenwriter Dan Rosen--surely at both's finest hour--created with this film perhaps the ultimate cautionary tale of what dehumanization and rage labels like ""liberal"" and ""conservatives"" can create when accepted as absolute identity.

Rosen was at one time a stand up comic with a taste for dark humor, and ""The Last Supper"" provides that in spades (if you have the stomach for it).

The plot of the film is really only a skeleton for what the creators are trying to say.  A group of liberal undergraduate college students invite vicious right-wing and well known Conservative pundits to for a pleasant dinner, and then perform a little ""Arsenic and Lace"" with a blue bottle of poison they mask as strong wine.  One has to suspend one's disbelief a little to enjoy the movie: if these people are so famous, why the hell don't they tell anyone where they're having dinner or who invited them?  People like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Ann Coulter make sure they are heavily guarded at all times.  Though all five of them are involved, the leader (played with a perfect concentrated madness by a young Courtney B. Vance) Luke is the engine behind it all.

At the beginning of the film a young soldier (Zac) returning home from the Persian Gulf War (""Was that a war or a Republican TV commercial?"" Luke unwisely asks) needs shelter from the rain.  The five make a bad choice and let him in.  Things go from unpleasant to bad to worse to homicidal as the anger builds between this maniac and the five students; he praises Hitler, deems liberals less than human beings, and puts a knife to the throat of Mark, a Jewish student.  He then proceeds to break the arm of another member, lets him fall to the ground, and Mark stabs him in the back.

This is an important part in the film.  It wasn't *exactly* self defense.  While this guy was obviously sociopathic and may have hurt the rest of them, a second viewing shows Mark approach long after his friend has hit the ground and is no longer in danger.  It's hard to feel sympathy for Zac, but this is really how it starts.  Luke jumps right on the bandwagon, stating coldly: ""We should just finish dessert and bury the cracker.""

Later on, a local female sherrif shows up asking about Zac.  He had, apparently, raped murdered a young girl in the community before arriving.  This fuels the group's thoughts that if they kill these people before they live out a natural life, they may be saving the world from great harm.  The ancient shoulda woulda coulda question is asked repeatedly, at the film's climax: ""It's 1909.  You find yourself in a bar with a young artist named Adolf Hitler.  Do you kill him to save billions of people?""

Title and Rosen toy with the viewer, swaying from the wussy excesses of ultra liberals to the outright evil of the far right.  Both become annoying.  Still, though, when we encounter ""Norman"" (Ron Perlman), the group's main target, we see what they are driving at.

A hilarious masterpiece, more relevant today than ever.",1252195200,3,3028,4.667924528301887
803354,4,6304177259,"Have you ever wondered what hardcore liberals dream of doing to their right-wing adversaries?  In ""The Last Supper,"" the audience gets to see just that.  Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard and Annabeth Gish head up a quintet of superior-minded liberals who quickly gain a taste for murder after helping out a right-wing nutjob (Bill Paxton).

When Paxton goes too far at the supper table, it costs him his life.  This sets into motion a string of murders by the five like-minded friends.  They invite right-wing enemies to their supper table and throw questions at them in order to determine whether the conservative lives or dies.

As the bodies pile up, the lust for blood grows stronger in some members of the group.  The local sheriff (a solid Nora Dunn) is also growing suspicious of the group and the wonderful tomatoes that begin to grow in their back yard.

Soon enough, the group encounters the holy grail of all conservatism, a loudmouthed Rush Limbaugh-type character played to perfection by Ron Perlman.  When he proves to be a strong adversary, the group unravels and begins to argue with itself about whether or not Perlman should live or die.

In the end, though, Perlman's fate is determined.  Does he live or die?  You'll have to watch this dark comedy to find out.

The strongest performances in ""The Last Supper"" come via Perlman and Courtney B. Vance, who plays one of the loftiest of the five murderers.  Gish and Eldard are exceptionally over-the-top in their performances, actually weakening the film a bit.

Overall, this film takes no sides in the political arena.  Sure leftist loonies appear to have the upper hand throughout, but conservatives get a few punches in too.

I recommend this film to liberals so that they can live out some of their wildest fantasies.  Extreme right-wingers are given their just desserts.  I also recommend this film to conservatives because it gives a hilarious look into the lives lefties who believe they know what's best for everyone but, when given a strong adversary, fall all to pieces and actually turn on one another.",1236384000,2,2073,4.871428571428571

A group of left-wing graduate students put this theory into practice, after a chance meeting with a right-wing truck driver leads them down the path of murder and to the realization that some people deserve to die.

""The Last Supper"" is one of my all-time favourite movies and has maintained its place in my top 20 film list, ever since I saw it for the first time on late-night television about 5 years ago. Although, as far as I can ascertain, the script of this film was written specifically for the screen, it actually plays out more like a stage play than a movie. Normally that would bother me, but in this case it doesn't, as this whole film is essentially a philosophical debate between left-wing and right-wing extremists, and it is for the dialogue that this film is of interest, not the action. One of the best things about this film is that, ultimately, the writer, Dan Rosen (who also wrote the equally excellent ""The Curve""), does not come down in favour of one side or the other in his debate. It is left to the audience to decide who they believe is right.

I can imagine that ""The Last Supper"" might not be to everyone's tastes. In my family, alone, my father and I love it (after out most recent viewing, we spent several days discussing whether Rosen himself was on the side of the left or the right), but my mother hates it (she considers it to be too dark). However, if you have a black sense of humour and are interested in an entertaining debate on the topics that I mentioned above, then you definitely give this film a go.",1219622400,4,1635,4.3927392739273925

803361,4,6304177259,"To express it in non-American political terms:

The movie revolves around 1990s students who, being middle-class with some conscience, agonize and cannot decide if they are good liberals or genuine leftists. By killing people who express morally and socially repressive views, they think that they have found a solution. Nevertheless, they are firmly stuck within the ideology of individualism (hence, the initial naive, or even stupid premise that if you eliminated Hitler, fascism would not have come about).

Finally, they are tricked and killed by a wily demagogue who, being himself a liberal in the 19th c sense (ie he does not advocate monarchy and accepts the trappings of a liberal democracy such as parliaments and elections), poses the same question that has crippled the US left for most of the century: free speech (notably, the movie does not problematize big media -- it's all an individual choice, right?).

You could argue the Clintonite intelligentsia lefty-liberal students get what they deserve from a fellow liberal on the rightist side of the spectrum. This is what makes the movie so amusing and appealing to all kinds of American liberals, whether on the left or on the right: is it a tragedy, a comedy or a farce?

We'll see the next round of this game in 2008, folks...and it won't be for the better of most of us, especially for the conservative pinkoes among us.",1166313600,4,1390,4.952789699570816

803425,5,6304177259,"This is an excellent movie that never really recieved much publicity when it came out.  What this movie basically tries to depict what it would be like if a group of liberals decided to go to extreme measures to rid the world of outspoken right-wingers who's death (to coin a phrase) would make the world a better place in their eyes.  It does not sound like something worth observing but a few years ago I just happened to catch it playing on a cable movie channel and I just couldn't stop watching it!
The movie starts with you introduction to the primary characters consisting of a group of liberal graduate students at Iowa State University.  This group is played by Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, a still relatively unknown Cameron Diaz, and the great character actor Courtney B. Vance.  The story starts out on a stormy night while all but one of the students is watching T.V. and discussing the nonsense gloating of well known conservative Norman Arbuthnot (Ron Perlman).  Then there is a knock on the door and upon answering it they find out that their other roommate's car had broken down and he had been brought home by a truckdriver named Zack (Bill Paxton).  They decide to be polite and invite Zack in for dinner.  Through the course of events they find out that Zack is an extreme right-winger and desert storm veteran (and argument waiting to happen).  To make a long story short they get into a scuff wherein Zack breaks Pete's (Ron Eldard) arm and Marc (Jonathan Penner) in the heat of the moment stabs Zack in the back with a kitchen knife.
In the aftermath of this incident, they (as calmly as they could) decide that it is best to not mention this to anyone as the courts would probably side with Zack.  So they bury Zack in the backyard and dump his pickup in the river.  Well in the days after the incident, after much deep conversation about what happened (which we liberals tend to do), they start to think about whether what happened was actually a bad thing or not.  (What if someone with enought motivation were to get rid of some of these dangerous right wing a** ho*es and in the process make the world a ""better place"")
So they basically form a plan to invite a different person for dinner and discussion every weekend that has extreme conservative views and try to change their minds about things through debate.  And if the person cannot be persuaded, they kill them by giving them wine poisoned with arsenic.  Thereby getting rid of a potentially dangerous person (A potential Hitler they call it) and making the world a better place.
So this is how the story gets started and how the suspense is wound up through the course of their plan.  The people that they invite over are played by many well-known actors including Charles Durning, Mark Harmon, Jason Alexander(Seinfeld), and finally Ron Perlman's character himself.  The story is suspensefull and gripping and also includes a lot of insitefull symbolizm.  A definite must see for anyone liberal or conservative.  It holds a special significance for me because I am an Iowa State grad student myself (note: I am not really sure that it was actually filmed in Ames, Iowa I really don't recognize any of the scenery shown in the movie).  Let it be known that the extremedy of the political and social viewpoints presented by the characters in this film are not my viewpoints or beliefs.  It is just a wonderful movie for all adults.

Even if I spent the entire time banging my head against the wall for the whole time, it would have been a far better endeavor than watching this trash.
While ultimately this film tries to make you think about tolerating the opinion of the next person, it conducts its' lesson by creating conservative stereotypes as manifested by left-wingers. So if the roles had been reversed, liberals would be screaming about this film years later. But since the Hollywood community is controlled by left-wingers, you don't hear a peep out of anyone in that industry about the horrible personalities created by this film.
The sad thing is that the characters created in this film are really how Hollywood sees conservatives. Left-wingers actually create these people and truly believe that this is the way conservatives think and act. Of course, conservatives don't think and act as depicted in this film but left-wingers don't understand this point. This is the main reason why liberalism is a dying idealogy in the U.S. It's an idealogy that just doesn't get it. It creates enemies that don't exist and in fighting these imaginary enemies, their real opponents walk away the victor.
This might have been a good film if the ""conservatives"" in the film were real. That their opinions were those of real conservatives. But the problem would have been that the liberal characters would have been seen in a far worse light than just murderers; they would have been seen as irrational lunatics that can't see reason. And that's not what the director was trying to show. The idea was to show liberals as being well-intentioned yet mistaken in their methods.
If they had done the film correctly, conservatives would be invited to supper, they would have explained real-world thinking to the liberals, and the liberals would have killed the conservatives simply because they could not grasp what mainstream America already embraces as its' philosophy. But, again, this would have taken the film in too far of a supportive perspective of conservatives and that's certainly not acceptable to the producers of this poorly conceived tripe.",1067040000,14,2267,5.064171122994653

That's the question that Luke, the political science grad student asks his fellow grad students, all politically liberal and roommates in the same house in the aftermath of their killing an aggressive right-winger in self-defense?
The philosophical question has been demonstrated before.  Mark asks if anyone went back in time to 1909 and met a certain Austrian artist with one testicle by the name of Adolf, would you kill him and save six million Jews from being burned in the Holocaust?  To that end, the five propose to invite certain people to dinner, give him/her a chance to logically state their rightist views, and if they pass, they drink a toast with wine from the safe green carafe.  If not, they get the fatal blue carafe with arsenic, and that's their ""last supper.""  As Luke says, ""think of all the right-wing <expletives> the world would be better off without if somebody wasted them before any of them did any damage.""  I thought about it, and I felt like a groom after a particularly satisfying wedding night.
The movie itself starts with Norman Arbuthnot (Ron Perlman), a bearded werewolf-looking politician with his rants on TV:  ""What we need in this country, my friends, is leadership, someone who can stand up to the liberals, a return to the promise of the Reagan/Bush years, a time of unequalled growth in our country.  Be careful folks, you might just get me [elected to office].""  While Paulie is visibly offended, Mark merely comments that Norman ""takes anything trivial and turns it into a national debate.""  Luke is calm about it:  ""always good to keep track of what the enemy is doing.""  In fact the ever-calm Luke seems to be the voice of reason and persuasion.  At first, anyway.
Among the people who get the blue carafe is a reverend whose antihomosexual views extend to his response to AIDS being a disease by saying ""homosexuality is the disease.  AIDS is the cure.""  Another insists that women are the weaker sex and therefore need to be dominated.  Guess which carafe he gets?
Courtney Vance has some witty lines.  On the Gulf War, he says, ""That was a war?  I thought it was a Republican commercial campaign.""  On their first victim:  ""I say we bury the cracker and eat dessert.""  Annabeth Gish's rationalizing their actions is that ""they're not people, they're people who hate.""
One repeated motif that comes up are the jars of tomato juice that appear, symbolizing the blood the five have spilled.  The names of the five grad students are also interesting.  Paulie (Annabeth Gish), Jude (Cameron Diaz), Marc (Jonathan Penner), Luke (Courtney Vance), and Pete (Ron Eldard), which are synonymous with Paul, Judas, Mark, Luke, and Peter, five of Jesus's disciples.
This does bring to mind, despite their good intentions, do they actually have the right to take someone's life, even if that someone offends their political sensibilities?  Granted, the five are stung into action into doing something, in response to the right's argument that all the left do is protest, complain, and criticize, which kind of mirrors Richard Rorty's argument on the left's needing to be active.
I have leftist sympathies and after seeing the previews, I figured I'd enjoy this twist on Arsenic And Old Lace, reasoning mirroring the students in Hitchcock's Rope, with a politically left picture frame.  And I was right, but what a twist ending!",1062374400,5,3435,4.891191709844559

One by one, they invite these unfortunate souls to their home for pasta, wine, and poison.  As more and more guests are buried in the tomato garden in the back yard, the quintet becomes more bloodthirsty and anxious about the morality of their actions.  When SNL veteran Nora Dunn appears as a police officer investigating the disappearance of their first victim, they become downright paranoid.  Finally, they encounter a Rush Limbaugh-style radio talk show host who, in person, makes cogent arguments supporting the right of everyone to think and say whatever they will and the group is forced to consider the moral implications of what it is doing.  The end of the movie is an entertaining resolution to this dilemma.

Although there are some acting and scripting flaws, this  movie is great.  It makes you laugh, then it makes you gasp in horror...and  best of all: it makes you think.
This film left me thinking, ""Do I  really care that much about other peoples' opinions?""  I walked away  from this flick with a new philosophy and way of looking at people who  think differently than I: In America, we all have the right to be  wrong.
No matter what your political affiliation, you'll probably enjoy  this film.  Don't be too sensitive or you'll be offended. Just watch, think  and then think some more.",963532800,7,722,4.5625
803490,4,6304177259,"I really enjoy this movie.  I watch it all the time.  But recently I read the cast list, and it contained people that were not in my version of the movie.  ""Immigrant hater?""  ""Skinhead?""  ""Young  Jude?""  I didn't see any of these characters in the movie--is there  more than one version?",959558400,,288,4.509803921568627

7864032,4,6304177259,"I love this movie; it's definitely one of my favorites! It isn't a 5-Star movie, but its a great story regarding morality, and 1) not taking yourself too seriously, and 2) allowing others their opinions. Yes, the protagonists are liberal arts graduate students, and the conservative archetypes are exaggerated examples of what is portrayed in modern media. The students act out what they believe is righteous retribution on their conservative dinner guests; moral conflict, self-loathing, and tragedy then later ensues.  It plays like a Shakespearean tragedy.",1477353600,2,559,5.5

7864034,2,6304177259,"I tend to like dark comedies, including those most people haven't seen like ""After Midnight.""  Some friends recommended this movie because it was a modern and satiric take on ""Rope.""  Cannot imagine what they were thinking.  The acting was OK and the plot was a little funny at first.  However, it was totally implausible as it moved along and after the third or fourth death of a person who would be unlikely to go to the house for dinner, I totally lost interest.  If you like B-movies, this may be a way to pass the time on a night you have insomnia.  Otherwise, I'd pass on this movie.",1471305600,,589,4.407407407407407
