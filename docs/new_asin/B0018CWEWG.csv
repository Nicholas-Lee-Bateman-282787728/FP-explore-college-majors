3416764,5,B0018CWEWG,"Gotham Awards-winner and a recent festival hit, this is a great, well-constructed indie film about the immigrant experiences in the US as well as the universal story of finding your place in the world.

Jorge, a dishwasher in a restaurant in Queens, falls for newly hired Chinese waitress. Restaurant's cook also shows interest in a waitress and then Jorge tries to take some action, while struggling with his inner demons, dominating Harlem roommate and shyness.

A captivating blend of psychological drama and magical realism.",1294099200,,528,5.273809523809524
3416765,5,B0018CWEWG,"This disturbing story portrays the life of a young Ecuadoran man Jorge who works as a dishwasher in a Greek diner in Jamaica Queens NY. The shakey hand held close up camera work and muddy colored photography draw you into the isolated gloominess of his world. The painfully shy Jorge is alienated from the other restaurant employees, except partially for a kindly young Asian waitress who at least notices him, and whom Jorge dreams about from afar. He spends his days scraping plates, staring at the Choking Victim poster on wall over the sink, and huddled on subway platforms as he makes his long commute each day. When he is particularily troubled he slips out the back and dives through a hole in the chain link fence behind the restaurant, as elevated trains rattle overhead.

The story is full of troubling obtuse symbols, voice overs from real and imaginary people,interspersed with montages of animated figures. To be honest I did not understand many of the symbols, images and voices. I was uncertain at times what was real and what was just a fantasy. However the overall drift of the story is spiritually powerful, and yet unresolved. At the end Jorge musters up the courage to save a customer in the restaurant who is choking. He then flees back to his shabby apartment huddling alone. One wonders whether this episode was the dawn of a new day for Jorge, or would he run again and withdraw, his life choked by loneliness. I wanted to believe in the former, however one aches to think it was probably the latter.",1259452800,,1524,4.707865168539326
3416766,5,B0018CWEWG,"... for its inefficiency and obscurity, and above all for its blatant Symbolism!, particularly the recurring ""rabbit with one long ear"" that seems to obsess the director/scriptwriter Steve Barron more plausibly than his central character Jorge. I could loathe this film for its unexplicated imputation of homosexual abuse in the relationship of Jorge to his shadowy roommate. I could spurn the intrusive graphics - doodles, cartoons, slick swirls of color emerging from food scraps - that seem to intend to reveal Jorge's subconscious perceptions but have no imaginable pertinence to his cultural mentality. Are there even jackrabbits in Ecuador? In short, I could hate this flick...

...but I don't! In fact, I found it riveting. Memorable. Unlike most American films these days, which I forget so quickly that I go blank if I try to review them. Why? First, the acting. Three unknowns play the leads, the psychotically shy dishwasher Jorge, the ebullient Chinese waitress Amy, and the cocky Italian kid who torments Jorge and hits on Amy. I'll leave them nameless. I hope they never become recognizable nameplated stars. Their acting talents are too fine to be wasted on stardom. They inhabit their identities in this plotless non-drama as persuasively as people whose lives one glimpses on a bus or in a queue. Second, the sound track: subtle, masterfully unobtrusive, tightly synched to the characters' moods. Composer Nico Muhly deserves to be named; may he often be employed in place of the usual Hollowwood hacks! Third, the cameraman, Antoine Vivas Denisov; his ""independent"" cinematography is quintessentially raw and akilter, and may it ever be so!

Fourth, and most important: it's creative. It's different. It's ambitious. What a joy it is to see a filmmaker taking chances, breaking modes, in this era of hyped banality!

I have no urge to explicate this film. Previous reviewers - Ms. Sound and Mr. Cousins especially - have offered insights enough. This production is being distributed by an entity called FILMMOVEMENT, which is dedicated to generating an audience for independent and experimental filmmakers. They have a DVD-of-the-month club. I'm thinking of joining.",1251244800,6,2184,5.2701149425287355
3416767,4,B0018CWEWG,"I don't even think I could tell you my interpretation.

I could tell you my feelings are in play. At the end of the movie there is... for me... sadness. Something connected with this movie. I guess I am going to call it quits with trying to figure it out.

I'm in a teaching life, working with immigrants. There, in the differences in people, in the cultural exchanges,there are things I often don't get, catch. So this movie was like a lens on some aspect of the totality of my job as I conference, teach, interact on a yard, go in and out of work... of seeing glimpses, of wondering and knowing others minds only just as a little bit in a puzzle that has lost most of the pieces...and finding confusion a state of functioning reality. Oh let me start over. I just finished watching this movie. Choking Man is a wonderful title. It speaks to a actual event in the movie and alludes to the character you come to see as the enigmatic center and his life here. This is an impressionistic piece.

The movie told the story in a diner centered on interactions that never come completely to some linear clarity. And at the center is a painfully shy immigrant who slides in an out of what I assumed was schizophrenia, maybe induced by the stress of trying to integrate all of this pressure for survival, needs of a person his age for love, the shyness, the city, what he left. I just don't know. But my interpretation was he is struggling with his mind as alien as he is alien to this new world. It's so powerful in that regard that I find it a mesmerizing movie. I remained utterly lost in a maze much of the time.

Why I'm struggling is that I'm not entirely clear on this character. He was allowed to remain only partially revealed. And his thoughts and feelings are so visceral. Read the other reviews and the blurbs, watch, see where you are then. I want to reveal the ending to say something but I can't except to say he brought forward real people I've known. He was remarkably constructed.

So I'll tell you...I've recently had a complex dream, turned 50, been working on some thinking about teaching. I've worked almost exclusively in over 25 years with immigrant experience. This carries to me something of that. At a time when just bits, pieces, impressions, aren't adding up. It gets something of the closeness to physical, rough, sweat work of coming to our country.. It has the feeling, lighting, the sound of it...somehow in the shyness of this boy, his mind being revealed,he is glimpsed, but in how hard you are trying to read it from your experiences you realize something as I am doing of late, about how different things are perceived. It has a confusion, it has triggered for me the feeling of sadness I have in my work, profound remembrance of certain people, it seems to make me want to try...harder....to just cut myself a break....but  to work aware. Watching. Hoping at least in moments we can see the suffering and walk in the shoes of one another. Try to reach out.

This isn't a film I can explain so I'm going to stop. I thought it was genius.
There aren't ten people I'd recommend it to, because I wouldn't trust it to too many. But to those you will understand and take from it how much each one of us is worth.
It was one I just felt. I really enjoyed the experience.",1246665600,,3293,4.43305785123967
3416768,1,B0018CWEWG,"A boring 90 min. and depressing to boot.  I had to wait in a long ""line"" to get this film from my library. When I finally did, it was a total disappointment. The NYTimes review says it all in a nutshell: ""Harsh and intermittently affecting but oppressively contrived and mostly pointless."" Don't waste your time.",1245628800,3,312,4.672727272727273
3416769,4,B0018CWEWG,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Choking-Man/dp/B0018CWEWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Choking Man</a>&nbsp;is a very good, albeit strange, movie.  Those who are into thoughtful, creative independent movies that push the envelope need look no further.  Granted, this type of movie is not for everyone.  The main character, Jorge, is often living between fantasy and reality.  Not all of his thoughts are kosher, and his inability to interact with others provides the main driver for most of the scenes.  Yet if you can suspend judgment, there is so much to learn from this movie.

Along with very well written characters, promising young actors, a great supporting cast of veteran actors, this film also makes excellent use of visuals combining excellent photography and interesting animation sequences.  In short, this movie really has an interesting blend presented in an imaginative way.

In the way of plot, there is not too much happening through many of the scenes.  Our main character is a dishwasher in a diner, and most of what we see is happening in his mind.  But his crush on waitress Amy, played by a bubbly and excellent Eugenia Yuan, conflicts with his shyness.  Not only does he have to contend with aggressive competition from guys at the diner, he also has to deal with all the demons in his head.

New York City is also a central character in the movie.  Travelling between Jamaica Queens and Harlem provides for some interesting characters.  Anybody who's ever taken the subways between those neighborhoods knows what a trek it is.  The sights and sounds of the subway and the grittiness of the people comes through.  You can see Jorge avoiding interacting with others as much as possible, whether people are mean or nice.

The title of the movie comes from the info poster in the diner which shows a *choking man* and how to administer the Heimlich maneuver.  The faceless man also becomes a character in Jorge's mind, blending with a sort of menacing alter-ego.

While the supporting cast is all good, it's a shame that big-name actors get top billing with it is these young unknowns who really carry the movie.  Yes, Mandy Patinkin is here, and he is good as usual.  But to be honest, his part barely makes use of his range and really is one that could have been filled by a character actor. Some of the Diner drama, such as the feuding waitresses and cooks, adds some atmosphere but at times seems to detract from the central story.  It seems like somebody tried to squeeze a traditional story in there to hedge their bets against Jorge's imagination being too far out for even independent film audiences.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  I've watched it more than 4 times over the past few months and each time I find something more to appreciate in it.  Once again, this is not for the typical movie night.  But if you want to watch something really subtle and creative, there's few new films that can top this.

Enjoy.",1226620800,9,2988,4.947791164658635
3416770,3,B0018CWEWG,"Jorge is a young and morbidly shy immigrant from Ecuador. By day he washes dishes at the Olympic diner in Queens, New York. At midnight he returns to his grimy apartment and a weird roommate. Jorge pulls his hooded sweatshirt over his forehead so that we barely see his face; he knows a little English but almost never speaks. At work an obnoxious cook named Jerry bullies and hectors him. But there is one bright spot for Jorge -- Amy, a bubbly waitress from China. She defends Jorge, but also enjoys flirting with Jerry. That's unfortunte, because Jorge had been enjoying her attention, shining his shoes, getting a haircut, and even buying her a gift. The isolation of Jorge's immigrant experience, and the dysfunction at his job, are exacerbated by his pathological introversion so that he is, in an emotional sense, choking. Even the church and Christian faith, which is repeatedly invoked, can't help him. The film ends with two surprise twists in the plot.

8269541,5,B0018CWEWG,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"" and straight up dramas.  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to the protagonist a lot.  Considering how shy, anxious, sensitive, and introverted I am myself, coupled with my self confidence issues and great fear of cities, I'd say the protagonist did better in that world that I probably would (proud suburbanite for life lol).  Disagree with other reviews saying the characters are caricatures - the bully actually wasn't too over the top or mean spirited, at least not compared to some people in life I've encountered (maybe that reviewer has had it easy?).  And for the reviewer who talked about shy people bringing out aggressive qualities in others, it sounded kinda close to victim blaming, so I hope I never work with them, haha.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494806400,,1791,4.741935483870968

8269546,1,B0018CWEWG,"....then watching this disgusting/gross movie!

I'm a huge fan of both Mandy P and I adore Aaron Paul, but this movie was totally disgusting to me.  Breaking Bad & Dexter had some rough parts but this movie really turned my stomach in a way that's hard to describe.  Why two amazingly talented men like MP and AP waste their time, talent and energy on such a piece of trash is beyond me, but I will say this...the little Chinese girl was adorable and impossible NOT to love!  The movie was offered to me FREE via Roku (not Netflix)  so I watched it only to make sure that nothing happened to the precious Chinese girl.  The movie didn't have an ""ending""....it just stopped.  So nothing about any of the bizarre weird, dysfunctional actors had any form of closure whatsoever....another reason I HATED it.  Unfortunately for me, the Roku channel that allowed me to view this POS for free, did not allow me to advance thru any of the scenes - it was either watch every frame of it - or cut it off.  So, I put up with the crap in it but at least I was able to mute the audio now and then - especially after the dumbazz dishwasher did the Heimlich Maneuver on the customer and he projectile vomited all over Mandy, etc., I was really glad I wasn't eating at the time.  Talk about gross...omg.  There was nothing redeeming about this story/movie or whatever they want to call it.  So, if this review doesn't get published...that's fine, but I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me...total waste of my time and in the end....it left a nasty taste in my mouth and left me asking ""WHAT WAS THE POINT????'
End of story. :(

8269547,5,B0018CWEWG,"A fine ensemble portrait of New Yorkers, those we pass on the street, stand next to on the subway, who serve our coffee, wash our dishes and hardly ever notice.  Others have told you the premise, described the characters, hailed the camerawork, sound and light and praised the performances better than I could.

Moving and quietly poetic, I would like to sing the praises of the brilliantly-devised titles and animation that runs throughout, and which express the heart, breath and lifeblood of the ""Outsiders"" of this film. Rabbits, little girls, clouds and bursts of light are visual icons that seem familiar.

Jorge, aching to be heard,  but choked by his morbid shyness, finds safety, hiding like a caged rabbit. When he is understood and treated with tenderness by the child-like Amy, we feel there is hope that he may conquer his demons; the voices that contradict him and hold him prisoner.

Watching a second time, the images of the poster and the animation come alive to remind me of the murals of  another ""Outsider,"" artist Henry Darger (1892-1905), who was, himself, one of those people hardly anyone noticed, and who, similarly, moved through life like a shadow.
Like Jorge, Darger's dress was shabby and he, too, was a solitary. Darger was institutionalized and considered feeble-minded.

The linear quality which Darger used in his murals, and his images  of children, exotic flowers, butterflies and exploding bombs, seem to have influenced the Title Artist and illuminated ""Choking Man.""

If you appreciate slice-of-life films, films about real people,  their struggles to connect, to be heard, and that reveal magic moments like flying carpets,  I add my recommendation of ""Choking Man.""",1367712000,4,1705,5.11913357400722
8269548,3,B0018CWEWG,"I found this in a bin for $2 at a resale shop. I love Breaking Bad and had no idea that Aaron Paul was in this until I watched it. I can't recall a film that most of the plot was as I envisioned it before I viewed it. After all, my favorite movies do involve reluctant heroes. The third act seemed literally posted on the wall before the film was even made. Maybe it's because my first job was spent in a corner washing dishes in a Greek restaurant? Visually, I think the story succeeds in showing the point of view of a extremely introverted young man smothered under the weight of strong anxiety. There are days where I don't feel like talking to anyone and at times, that seems to attract the folks who can't breathe without frequent social interaction. I think the Jerry character harassed Jorge just short of being violent while the Asian waitress was there to show that someone else could successfully adjust to a new culture as well as Jorge fails to. Shy people (in some cases) ARE lazy and and bring out aggressive qualities in those that are forced to work with them. Bullying can stem from a frustrated person trying hard to get to know someone who is holding back.",1354924800,,1176,4.39908256880734
8269549,1,B0018CWEWG,"Independent, low budget movies are my favorites. Movies about characters more than what they do are my favorites. Gritty movies set in gritty locations are my favorites. Movies in which almost nothing happens are my favorites. Movies filmed in New York are my favorites because New York is my home and my favorite place on earth. So I had great expectations for Choking Man, because it looked like it had nearly everything I love most in a movie. Man, was I disappointed!

This is a phony, manipulative and unrelentingly annoying movie. It's as phony, manipulative and unrelentingly annoying as a 1980s sitcom with a too-loud laugh track. Every character is a caricature: the dumb immigrant is EXTREMELY dumb; the old, brassy, heart-of-gold waitress is EXTREMELY brassy and gold-hearted; the gruff diner owner with a heart of gold is EXTREMELY gruff and gold-hearted; the obnoxious Irish bully is EXTREMELY obnoxious; the sweet Chinese girl is so sweet she made my teeth hurt. There is not one believable human being in the whole cast. I hated this movie.

People who go on and on about how great this movie is must love American television, because that's exactly where this movie belongs, as a TV movie on the Hallmark Channel or Lifeline or even on NBC or ABC or Fox. It takes all the things that can make a movie great and cheapens and twists them into a revolting, irritating glob of phony, rigged, forced emotionalism. This is no quirky, gritty, unconventional independent masterpiece.
