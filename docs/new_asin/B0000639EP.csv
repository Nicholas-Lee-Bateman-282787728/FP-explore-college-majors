1688886,3,B0000639EP,"Before you Berserk fanatics start complaining about the score, let me just say that Berserk really is a wonderfull anime, and one of the best series of all time. The show includes a surprisingly rich story, which is also quite dark for a TV show. Unfortunately, after watching an imported DVD set, it seems that the series' producers spent more resources than necessary on the first episodes, and didn't quite realize that the story needed to fit in a single TV season.
The reason I say that is because they left a HUGE gap in the storyline. The story does reach an ending, but some very important pieces of the storyline were skipped.
A series with such high production values should not have this sort of problem. Thankfully the manga includes what was left out. In fact, I hope that someone picks up the manga and decides to continue producing this wonderful series. A story this good deserves a more complete series.",1016668800,2,920,4.685185185185185
1688887,5,B0000639EP,"I have been watching anime for over 12 years. I have seen many series but this one is probably one of the greatest ever. If you like violent animes this is for you, if you like anime with a great plot and characters this is for you. I mean the main character is incredible, i have seen the entire series and can only say one thing....IT IS INCREDIBLE. I think that if you like anime at all this sereis is a definite must see. This series is not a happy one for all you DBZ and pokemon fans so leave your 4 year old brother in the other room when you watch this one. To sum it up this is a must have for any anime fans.",1016496000,3,618,3.874015748031496

1688889,5,B0000639EP,"Berserk is a brilliantly crafted series, built upon a foundation of universal themes and elements of Greek and Shakespearian tragedy. There is excellent use of foreshadowing throughout the series, and the character interactions are outstanding. Some viewers may be put off by the violence and bloodshed in the series, but remember, many of the greatest works of literature deal with violence in a similar fashion. Berserk continues to garner more interest as the series continues, and after viewing the entire series, you will want to watch it again, with new insight.",1015718400,,568,5.252747252747253
1688890,5,B0000639EP,"When I first decided to plop my self down with some buds to watch this I wasn't expecting all too much.  It is called Berserk after all-so we figured we'd be letting charadter development and plot sit second string to some high quality mindless violence.  Don't misunderstand, there's violence-and plenty of it-but what makes this series so incredible is the intricate relationships between characters and an enveloping story.  I can sit and watch all 25 episodes of the series in a row, and then still be completely happy to watch it all over again later.  Pick this series up and I think you too will find yourself placing it amongst your favorites.",1015545600,2,651,4.785714285714286

1688919,5,B0000639EP,"Berserk is a great anime. It's got great animation, cool music, great characters and voicing, great story, and tons of action and drama. My only beef with Berserk is the ending, or lack thereof. The 1st episode is actually the last in chronological order. There is a huge gap between the last two chronological episodes and no conclusion. I heard that the manga goes farther, but I never could get into reading manga. I really do like Berserk and recommend it to anime fans, but there is no ending and the price that I'm seeing for it is insane. Don't pay more than $20 for it. You can probably find it for that much.",1353974400,,617,4.421052631578948

1688921,4,B0000639EP,"Berserk is one of those few anime fantasies that aren't meant to make us laugh. From the first moments to the last, it's as serious as possible. Dark imagery rules this series, with battles and blood and characters that are often angry and trying to prove themselves in some way or another. And the themes are even darker, dealing with vengeance and a hunger for death.

In volume one of Berserk, we are introduced, in the first episode, to the Black Swordsman, a massive man who carries a massive sword. Though we aren't with the Black Swordsman for long, we are introduced through him to the future of this anime series, and to the themes I mentioned before. From there, it gets into the core story of Guts (who becomes the Black Swordsman) growing into a man working as a professional killer. He's a silent, efficient warrior, who's only out for the bounty. But then he meets Griffith, the charismatic leader of the Band of the Hawk, a mercenary group as proficient at killing as a group as Guts is at killing alone. Guts is defeated by Griffith in battle, and is forced to join the Band. It's something that he's never had before, companionship, and he initially wants nothing to do with the Band. Over time, however, he's able to do something he's never been able to do before, and that's find friendship. Though he's still a loner in battle, he feels that his hastiness is more a way to keep his men alive than for actual personal gain. By the end of the volume, Guts leads his own unit of men in the Band of the Hawk, and all his men look up to him as the hero he's become.

The first volume begins with a story far in the future, and from there it's actually a series of flashbacks telling the difficult past of the Black Swordsman, and how he, as Guts, got to where he is now. The early parts of the story is relatively light, but the promise of that first episode is profound, because we already know that, no matter what, something bad is eventually going to happen. And that, to me, is what hurts this series. It seems that Guts's past is nothing compared to his future. Though the story itself is good, why didn't they begin the story a little further ahead, and have shorter flashbacks?

Despite that, though, the beginning of Berserk is still good and shouldn't be ignored. I'd recommend this to those of you who've read the manga, or for fans of a similar anime series, Record of Lodoss War and it's many sequels and prequels. The darkness of this series, the hopelessness that surrounds the main character Guts (later the Black Swordsman), is a different spin that can't be found often in fantasy anime.",1136764800,,2620,4.5
1688922,3,B0000639EP,"This is a review of the entire series. The series was pretty good. The animation was just ok. This story follows Gutz and the band of the hawk, a group of mercenaries that he is essentially forced into joining when he is beaten by Griffith. This follows the many battles they fight together assanations etc.

The good: The show is pretty violent with plenty of action and fights. Gutz is a cool character and he evolves throughout the series, becomes stronger a better fighter etc.

The Bad: It took me a few episodes to get into it. The animation is just so so. I wasn't too happy with one of the truths about Griffiths past. It gets quite strange at the end. The Anime show does not conclude the story. You can finish it in comic form but I never got around to it.

Although more negative was outlined the show is actually pretty good, (not great) but pretty good. Worth a watch.",1118966400,,881,4.392638036809816
1688923,4,B0000639EP,"Berserk is not your average anime series.
It's a very dark and grity series.  Thats why I love this series
so much.  The story is amazing.  I love all the characters cause they all have there own thoughts and abilities of understanding.
The character development is great!  From watching the first five episodes I can tell this series is just gonna get more bloodier by the minute.  This isn't a type of show to watch with your little ones.
I'm not gonna say what the story is about cause theres enough reviews to read from to know what it's about.  I think Berserk has it's own unique original story that keeps it in hold.  Well duuuu.  Of course!  After finishing the 5 episodes I knew I had to watch the rest!  This series is very addictive.
These 5 episodes are fantastic!  I can't wait to finish them so I can start reading the Manga.
Be sure to get this one.  It's absolutely amazing!
I will be getting volume 2 of the anime soon.
Ps....The opening music theme is awesome.

1688924,4,B0000639EP,"This is my first real exposure to anime. The only other time I watched some of it was in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"", but it is only in a few passages in the movie that anime is used. Since I enjoy epic fantasy, I thought a good way to start out in anime was in a series that used this genre. I found that I enjoyed the first five episodes of ""Berserk"", and even though at some points I found myself having trouble figuring out where the story was going, I was left looking forward to the next disc in the series.
In the first episode, the Black Swordsman arrives in a town looking for a monster that has the habitants under his grip, living in a world of fear and misery. The Black Swordsman carries along a huge sword that is bigger than him, he is branded in one of his shoulders and is visited in his dreams by demons that claim to own him. At this point there is no clear plot in the story, but in the next four episodes the story goes back to our hero's youth and the viewer finds out that his name is Guts and he honors this name to the extreme. Guts meets with the Band of the Hawk, which is lead by Griffith, an effeminate but very skillful warrior. After some initial quarrels Guts joins the band of mercenaries and an interesting relationship develops between him, Griffith and Caska, who was until that moment the right hand of Griffith and apparently is in love with him. In episodes two through five there are three main points of interest intertwined in the story: the relationship between Guts and the other Band of Hawk members; the missions in which the band embarks gaining fame and respect; and the glimpses at Guts childhood, which helps the audience to make sense of some of his actions and attitudes.
The series starts out a little slow, but through the episodes, it captures the viewers' attention and one starts to sympathize with the main character. I was left craving for more information about the characters' past and future and will definitely get the next installment.",1079222400,3,2005,4.436314363143631
1688925,5,B0000639EP,"At one point in your life you come across something that's so great and breath taking that your forced to conclude that nothing else in existence could ever match it's equal. For me that something is the Berserk series. There are a few people who made bad reviews about Berserk; saying its boring and no good blah blah blah. That goes to show you that Berserk isn't for everyone. We all have our likes and dislikes, that's what makes us human. But if you look at all of the reviews; there are more people who enjoyed this anime then those who didn't. Those who gave bad reviews about Berserk weren't worthy to enjoy it. And there will be plenty more. So if your looking for Berserk to be some DBZ/POKIMON/Kiddy anime with little cute characters running around, BERSERK IS NOT FOR YOU! Other wise....BUY THIS ANIME! If you cant afford 1-5 buy the whole set on 3 cds by a group called FX. Just do a search on Google for Berserk FX sale and you will come across a few places with the whole serious for like 28 bucks. -Hardcore Berserk Fan  NosferatuX

1688926,5,B0000639EP,"Recently, I've been getting more and more interested in the art of anime.  Anime is exciting, thrilling, deep, and even disturbing at times.  Anime also has the undeniable power of telling an interesting story.  I picked up ""Berserk 1: War Cry"" because it looked like something that was promising.  After watching all of the first disc, I immediately ran out of the house to pick up the next two volumes and plan on getting the last remaining three very shortly.  ""Berserk"" is a dark and haunting series that doesn't hold back for one single second.
The town of Midland is covered in darkness and evil as it is controlled by a treacherous king.  Things change one night when a stranger by the name of Guts comes to town with vengeance on his mind.  He fights with a sword that is twice his size and has uncontrollable urges of rage that gets the best of him.  One thing is for sure as this exciting series begins; Guts is willing to wage a one-man war against the one who has done him wrong no matter what the cost.
The first episode deals with what's going on in the present while the other four deal with the past and history of Guts.  While it's hard to know exactly what is going on with only the first five episodes, they are extremely involving and exciting.  I found myself watching all five episodes in a row and wanting to watch more.  I always admire stories that deal with flawed heroes, as those are the ones you can relate to the most.  By no way is Guts a superhero by any means.  He has demons and flaws, just like everybody else.  While his strength and will is incredible and sometimes over-the-top, we buy into it because the character of Guts is portrayed with real flaws and emotion.  So long as you can create a believable main character, everything else is fair game.
Be warned; this is no show for children.  Just from seeing the first five episodes, I can already tell that it's only going to get darker and more disturbing.  The episodes contain strong and brutal violence, extreme amounts of blood and gore, nudity, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  The DVD contains outtakes, production sketches, trailers, and an art gallery.
""Berserk 1: War Cry"" shows a promising and exciting start to a dark and haunting series.  I cannot wait to watch the others and anticipate that it will be time well spent.  If you're looking for some good and dark anime with interesting characters, ""Berserk"" might be something that you'll want to check out.  Be sure to watch all five episodes before making any conclusions as to if you like what you're seeing.  The ""Berserk"" series has a powerful start--can't wait to see where it's going to take me next.",1074038400,7,2673,4.559748427672956
1688927,4,B0000639EP,"I bought the Berserk series a few weeks ago after a hard time saving up for it.
and as many have sead if you are a fan of Record Of Lodoss War, a line that made me buy it :), likley you will enjoy this aswell.
it is a bit darker and a bit more violent, sure lodoss had it's sare of wars aswell but this is a bit more blody.
now on to the acctual series.
the first episode takes place sometime after the final episodes of the series and gives you some hints about what have happend in the past.
after the introduction episode you go a few years back i bellive 6 years since the main story spans about 4.
you meet a young warrior named Guts (a weird name but who cares he's coool) he swings a HUGE sword ala Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.
in this episode he meets up with Griffith and his mercenary band called Band Of The Hawk, and as the story develops he starts to love his commrades in arms more and more.
what makes this anime great is the firm development of the story all the way untill the two last episodes.
a small Spoiler ahead.
the last two episodes is mainly just the Hawks getting eaten by demons and the birth of a new demon king, it's to messy and no feeling in it all. but not to spoil everything i will not go anyfurther.
in general this anime is well worth your money.",1067385600,3,1284,4.03921568627451
1688928,4,B0000639EP,"Berserk.  Just about one of the greatest midevil/fantasy war animes I've ever seen, heck, almost THE greatest anime series I've ever seen!  A deeply riveting and powerful story about loyalty, trust, friendship, betrayal, ambitions and dreams.  The characters are absolutely amazing, how they each have their own dreams and goals that they fight fearsomely for, and their struggles to find themselves and their places in life.  The main character, Gutts, is without a doubt one of the best anime characters you'll ever come across.  Not only does he absolutely destroy with that enormous sword, but his journey through life and his turmoils as he tries to find himself are extrodinary and touching.  And personally, I think he's really cute too.  :P  Totally different from any series you will ever see, this anime is remarkable, EXCEPT (like most anime shows), the ending leaves you feeling cheated, depressed and a little angry as you never see what actually happens to the characters after.  Thats why I gave it 4 stars, it really is a 5, just the ending ruins it.  However, to find out what happens next you'll have to get the manga, and trust me, after watching this series you'll be dying for it.  It is so good I can't recommend it enough!!  So get it already!!",1061164800,,1267,4.814814814814815
1688939,4,B0000639EP,"Berserk is every thing I love about anime and everything I hate about anime all in one. I have to say though that I will be buying the entire series despite what I consider the ultimate sad ending. The majority of the series is great, a warrior named Guts with a sword as large as he is joins up with a mercenary group called ""The Band Of The Hawk"" and quickly becomes second in command. The leader of this group is Griffith a man more graceful than courtly ladies; a man born of humble beginnings destine to be king. The series is full of lovable characters and original storyline and is well worth owning. Aside from the ending being sad the only complaint I could come up with is some battles involve it switching from animation to still artwork, but that's not too bad at all. I also recommend buying the collector's case; its artwork is beautiful.
Summary: Buy it, be prepared for an unhappy ending, and if need be make up an alternate ending in your head were everything is happy (that's what I did with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop).",1056758400,,1052,4.455958549222798
1688940,4,B0000639EP,"To start, I have only seen this first dvd in the series, so I am not going to discuss the entire story, only this one dvd.  This disk contains the first 5 episodes, and the box set that this edition is included in can hold all 6 volumes.
The box itself is very unique in that it isn't the standard 5 sided affair.  Instead, it works like a giant clamshell to completely cover the individual cases.  That aside, this disk looks to be the start of a wonderful series.
The first episode, in my opinion, is allowing the viewers a glimpse at the current state of the main character.  You can tell he is a hardened warrior, and he has both the skills and the scars to prove it.  However, the next 4 episodes go back into the character's past to show his growth.
I found this to be extremely interesting.  These episodes amount to a very large flashback, and each contains mini-flashbacks to the character's youth.  At the same time, they tell the story of how this character went from a wandering mercenary to become a leading force in one of the best mercenary armies around.  They also tell of his friendship with the very enigmatic leader of this army.
All in all, this disk lays a very interesting groundwork for what is definitely not your ordinary sword and sworcery anime.  Besides the first episode, there is no hint of magic at all.  This makes you wonder how that fits into the story, as well as how the main character got to that point.
As others have mentioned, there is also the interesting tidbit about the main character's sword.  Already abnormally huge, it slowly evolves and grows as the character's own strength and prowess grows.  After glimpsing its size in episode #1, and then seeing how it started, one wonders how large it will get by series end.
As far as technical specs go, this dvd has a good assortment of extras.  The standard trailors for other series are joined by a selection of artwork and concept sketches.  My favorite extra, though, has to be the voice-over outtakes.  These are where the voice actors mispoke or completely ignored the script while dubbing, and the creators have given us a glimpse at this along with the scenes that they were working on.  In the end, these are hilarious, and they help lighten the mood of an otherwise very dark dvd.",1056067200,,2283,4.53170731707317
1688941,4,B0000639EP,"A lot of people consider every anime to be an instant classic.  They either love it or despise it.  While Berserk is a good series with many memorable moments, it can hardly compare with a series like evangelion or samuri x.  Berserk starts off as a mindlessly violent anime.  There is no real character development or story.  As the story progresses, we begin to feel for a few select characters.  The characters themselves aren't very normal but in their own bizzare way they do seem to act natural and realistic for who they are.  The violence also increases as the series goes on.  This series' biggest problem is it attempts to be realistic in the battle scenes but every blow goes directly through any armour and sends gallons of blood everywhere.  Yet, despite how easily blood spews out, you will never see a person's intestines or anything like that.  Guts himself gains the ability to kill off a hundred mercenaries by himself when the series is at it's best.  As for the plot, it never really becomes anything great.  It is pretty basic, a war drama. The leader turns evil and he turns on his best friend, a captain, who then spends his days wanting revenge.  This doesn't mean the series is as predictable as one might expect.  The series has such a graphic level of violence and realism that every consequence can have a major impact on the characters.  These consequnces will more then likely startle viewers as they lead to some scenes that would be obvious if it wasn't for how violent and tragic they are.  Despite characters, dying, being rapped, being tortured, or worse, there lies the story of a simple minded boy trying to find his place in the world and a dream for his life.  This is a good series and deffinately deserves to be added to the shelf of any anime fan.  However, new time anime fans may want to check out titles like evangelion or samuri x first.  Also, anyone with a weak stomach or who has trouble with graphic violence may want to stick to more child appropiate animes.  This is deffinately an ""adult"" anime.",1053820800,,2048,4.589531680440771
1688942,5,B0000639EP,"Yes, finally, finally, finally--There is an anime that doesn't follow the pack, that doesn't depend entirely on cliches, or have incredibly annoying and unrealistic characters! Finally!
It's been a long time since I've gotten so excited over a series. I've been watching anime since about 1995 or so, and over the years, I've become jaded (I think I share this sentiment with a fellow reviewer of this show). Nothing was exciting, everything was so alike and so boring. But then I took a chance on this show, and am so happy that I did. This series is a breath of fresh air.
Taking place in a fictional Medieval-type world, we are introduced to the character Guts, an ""anti-hero"" if there ever was one. Massive, muscle-bound, and scarred, Guts is not the usual type seen heading up a series these days--this position seems to be reserved for scantily-clad females or pretty boys--and in no sense is he perfect. He is blunt, crude, and rarely speaks. A fierce warrior trained from a young age, he kills because it's all he knows. He does, however, seem to have morals, they just aren't that obvious all the time.
The tale takes its time to unravel. In episode one, we see where Guts is going to end up, as ""The Black Swordsman"" on the path of revenge. But for what, it isn't entirely certain. The series rewinds over the next episodes and Guts's past is revealed. There are many demonic overtones to the show, and Guts's origins become crystal-clear as the series moves on.
This disc covers Guts's beginnings in the Band of the Hawk, a legendary army of bandits and mercenaries that are attempting to reach the goal that their leader, the charismatic Griffith, wants to attain--to rule an empire. Griffith realized the moment he met Guts that he would be the man to help him realize this dream. The reluctant Guts is forced into joining after losing a duel to Griffith, much to the dismay of Casca, the only woman in the Band of the Hawk who has an extreme loyalty to Griffith.
""But are Guts and Griffith GAY?"" This issue seems to come up a lot with this show. Sure, at times, it seems like Guts and Griffith ""got it goin' on"", but there is no concrete evidence to support this theory. Sure, Griffith is one of those ""pretty boys"", and yeah, he and Guts do share a strong loyalty that deepens as the show progresses, but as far as romantic love goes, if you judge it all on body language and longing gazes--I guess each viewer can draw his own conclusions.
""Berserk"" is one of those rare shows that sucks the viewer in because of its very unpredictabilty. Since its center is war and violence, you really don't know what's going to happen. There are no set ""formulas"", like those used in so many other series. Every show runs its own course in a different and unique way, and the way it's told is part of what makes it so compelling. The character design is gorgeous--no insanely big eyes, the proportions make sense, and some of the characters actually have noses (gasp!). There are some issues that come up like attempted rape, the murder of a child, and child abuse, but it isn't overdone or ""glorified"" in any sense. This show is really quite intelligent and unique and should not be missed by the TRUE anime fan.",1050364800,2,3216,4.585069444444445
1688943,5,B0000639EP,"At first when I viewed War Cry, I thought it was pretty cheesy and dumb. However, as I continued to watch and began to get the subsequent episodes, the episodes grew on me.

1688944,2,B0000639EP,"I couldn't finish this disc although I did get through three episodes.  The main reason I dig anime is for the fantastic artwork and stylistic animation.  I know this is a series of episodes and not a movie, but the action is very stilted.
In one scene when two characters are dueling with swords on top of a hill, their blades lock and they freeze-then there is a watercolor painting of the same scene while you hear the sound effects of swords clanging in the background.
Maybe I'm spoiled by other anime I've seen, but this is just not what I'm paying for.  I want to see actual frame by frame movement, not still frames with only a mouth moving on a character's face.  I know that anime has it's own tricks it employs and usually does so to great effect, but this looks lazy or rushed.  The poor overall presentation really distracts
from the story which is itself predictable and slow.

1688946,5,B0000639EP,"This is one of my all-time favorite animes, but before I get into that, I'd like to address a few things here:
1) Griffith is NOT gay.
2) If you absolutely loved Record of Lodoss War, you probably won't like this. No inane love triangles, plot that drags ooon and ooon, or loads of magic. If you liked Army of Darkness, the video game version of this series, dark/mideval/character study stuff, and good 'ol fashioned booty kickin', you'll probably like this. I recommend this for anime fans who want a little more from their TV than just episodic bleh. And don't think this is a guy show either, I'm a girl and I love it!
3) If you don't like the first episodes, it gets better.
4) In my opinion, this series stands on its own. It surpasses sword-and-sorcery... it shouldn't be lumped together with others like that.
Berserk is not your average anime (no grotesquely huge eyes, cat girls, or perfect hero). Lots of carnagae, a little conspiracy, a big betrayal, a few monsters, and a sprinkle of romance focused on a main character that kicks a ...load of booty. Some people just don't like him, but he has to be my favorite male anime character. His struggle to find his own purpose in life, his own dream, is fascinating. The other characters in this series stay with you also. The overly ambitious Griffith. Casca, striving to find her place at Griffith's side. The kind-hearted Judeau, resentful Corkus, and all-around awesome Zodd.
In conclusion, I'd recommend this series to anyone who is not squeamish, likes mideval fantasy and/or character studies, and is over the age of sixteen.

The fight scenes were always a still picture with a whosh noise and a panning camera.  The characters made me feel nothing.  I didn't even like any of them.  The plot moved like a glacier.

1688948,5,B0000639EP,"If you read the other reviews, you pretty much know what Berserk is about and I'm not going to rehash the storyline. What I will say about this series that I've seen so far is that it is the fantasy I have always wanted to see.
I've always somewhat liked fantasy, but there was always something lacking with it. Everything was just a little too perfect, a little too predictable. With Berserk, it's different. It's fantasy injected with gritty realism and harsh warfare, and most of all, genuine emotion and believable characters.
The more you watch of the series, the more it grows on you. Everytime I end a dvd, I anticipate the next episode. Berserk grabs you and pulls you into their world, not just letting you watch from above. This is not Lord of the Rings sort of fantasy. There is gore aplenty, rape, crooked royalty,  love, and a hero who doesn't have a reason to fight.  Berserk is not just a series, it is a sweeping epic that spans every emotion.
Highly recommended, but only to mature audiences.",1040947200,3,1009,4.569060773480663
1688959,5,B0000639EP,"Kento Miura's original Manga 'Young Animal' is the basis of this series, an uncomfortable, gritty story of medieval warfare and magic, which rarely holds its punches.  In keeping with the manga, which is still ongoing, this series plays hardball with the viewer's sensibilities continually confronting us with a very realistic view of the horrors of warfare even as it spins out its noir fantasy.
As many Anime series do, the first episode, 'the Black Swordsman,' is really from the middle of the story.  Our first view of Guts, a hair-trigger killer with a sword the size of a sidewinder missile, is as he enters a town terrorized by a demonic overlord who feeds on human terror and misery.  The town's garrison is compose of criminals who think nothing of torturing children, but the Black Swordsman steps in - to late to save the town, but in time to challenge the author of all the misery.
In the next four episodes, the story returns to its beginning, and we meet the young Guts and see him starting out as a foundling tagalong to a mercenary band.  His childhood is every bit as grim as one might imagine, as he is force to kill his leader and then flees from on battle to the next.  Finally, he comes against the Band of the Hawk and its leader Griffith, and for the first time in years is overmastered by a swordsman.  Griffith sees the real value and strength hidden in the young warrior and is determined to add Guts to his troop rather than kill him.
Griffith's effeminate appearance hides a tough warrior and a proven battle master.  When he finally penetrates through the layers of emotional protectiveness that Guts hides behind a strong and mutually agreeable relationship develops.  Guts has troubles adjusting to this new, and disciplined, military unit, but he gradually earns the admiration of almost all of them, including the thorny Caska, a woman who is fiercely loyal to Griffith and his belief in destiny.
For all its violence, 'Berserk' strikes many sympathetic chords.  It isn't mindless violence, there is an underlying plot, and the production values and artwork are excellent.  Dialogue displays an unexpected complexity that signals almost from the beginning that this series is something special.  Keep in mind that it deals with some controversial issues, and is aimed at a mature audience.",1039737600,16,2322,4.853164556962025
1688960,5,B0000639EP,"I can best compare this series to Record of Lodoss War, but with much more violence and adult themes than Lodoss War had.  This series is definately not for children.  The story is of a mercenary named Guts and set in a world similar to Lodoss War, but with fewer fantastic creatures and different odd races (most all of the characters are human, with a few exceptions).  Do not expect to see a bunch of elves and dwarves and dragons, the non-human characters are few and far between through the first 5 episodes.
One hilarious bonus feature on all of the Berserk DVDs is the Outtakes.  Basically, it is a series of line reading errors placed over the same scene in the original anime scenes.  Watch them after viewing all of the episodes on the DVD so that you understand the context, but they are truly hilarious.  It's very different than those ""outtakes"" on other animated DVDs, which are actual added scenes.
This is an excelent series; any anime fan should buy it.",1039305600,17,970,4.578034682080925

1688962,5,B0000639EP,"I actully stumbled onto this anime by mistake.  While at a local store that sold fansub tapes, I decided to pick up the first volume which had the first 2 episodes on it.  I had remembered the berserk video game  being  released for the sega dreamcast, but dident think much of it.  After viewing the first two episodes, I was completely hooked.....
Story: The story is great because of its charecter development.  Everyone is explored throughout the serius, involving dark moments, such as guts's past, to hillarious moments, with coborlwitz's idiotic military ramblings.  The story takes place in a midevil european type of atsmophere, which provides a vivid geography for fantasy storytelling.  All in all, the story is about guts's journey through this dark world, until where the story began in episode one.  It involves mysticisim, religion,fantasy, politics, philsophy, and romance.  The realistic depections of these themes further entices the viewers interest.  This is definatly a thinking man's anime, even though it has lots of violence, rape, and nudity.
Music:The music in the serius is great.  It varies from celtic tunes, to tribal beats, to j-pop-ish music.  The engrishy opening music is kind of funny, but the ending theme music is haunting from the first note, causing you to look around your room for monsters that may jump out and attack you.
Animation:For what it is, the animation is not too bad.  It is low budget, but it was ran late a night.  I personally think the rugged look is quite unique.
Packaging:The individual dvd packages are good.  They are all designed in the same way, and allow quick indentification.  Artwork is also skillfully selected for the packages.  The box set to keep it in is alright, but it might have been cool to get a book or insert with it......
All in all, I would just like  to say.....WATCH BERSERK.  You won't regret it.",1037491200,,1881,4.911111111111111
1688963,2,B0000639EP,"I have the DVD of Beserk.  I was lured by the upbeat soundtrack of drums and choruses in the background giving that full warriordom atmosphere.  It is slightly disappointing.
I haven't finished the entire collection because it has just become so less interesting.  Yes, there is gore and yes, there is a small guy with a big sword.
There is a school of thought that promotes the necessity of a good soundtrack to propel a story foward.  Try watching a horror film on mute and see how much heebie jeebies you get.  Berserk accomplishes in doing the direct opposite.
If you want to be shocked I would recommend Ninja Scroll.  If you like a cool soundtrack (at least at the beginning) get Bubblegum Crisis.  If you want great character development get Rorouni Kenshin.  If you are just in the mood to sate a curious palate, then by all means get Berserk.

Now I won't argue about this guy and his own beliefs on what's good and what's not, but telling other reviewers that they are dumb and blind is very ignorant.  I found the art in Berserk to be not as good as other anime's, but the story is just incredible.  With the lack in art, I feel that the story has more than made up for it.  Not all production studio's have millions or a gagillion dollars.  That's my beliefs and I'm sticking to it.  Oh, but Mr. Gods Gift to Anime Reiviewers(Stupendous Whatever) probably thinks I'm either

1688965,4,B0000639EP,"This series is a bit confusing in the beginning. It is very interesting with a lot of action. There are a lot of mature ideas and content which not everyone might like, but it has a very interesting and twisting plot. The characters have a complex relationship and develops in different ways which leave you wondering how they could develop. This style of anime is a bit different from which ADV or Manga or Pioneer might produce but still it seems like its going to be a good one. Hope this review is helpful",1031529600,,509,4.425531914893617
1688966,4,B0000639EP,"To appreciate Berserk, I think it is necessary to understand that it is based on an on-going comic series in Japan.  In Japan, each ""chapter"" of any comic is published in numerous weekly or bi-weekly comic magazines, each geared to a certain audience.  It will come no surprise to any reader of the comic that Berserk is published in a bi-weekly comic magazine called ""Young Animal"".  Young Animal is largely an adult oriented (as in nudity & sex) comic magazine and therefore you have to realize that Berserk was never intended to for an young audience.  Trust me when I say that the anime does not even come close to portraying the graphic sex and violence that can be found in the actual comic.
  However, Berserk is not a comic carried by either sex or violence but rather the depth of its story.  Berserk is about the tale of the protaganist, Guts, living in a period of times that can only be equated to mideval England.  There are no guns (but there is gunpowder) and largely there is supposed to be no magic, e.g. fairies, dragons and such.  The story revolves around the growth and adventures of Guts, providing deep insight and detail from the time of his birth, his life as a mercenary, all the way to his fateful meeting with Gryphus and Gryphus ultimate betrayal of Guts (this is not a spoiler).
  To compare this animation to the Record of Lodoss Wars would be a mistake as this is a far darker anime.  This is a dark fantasy with a slight romance.  Themes of homosexuality, rape and violence permeate the comic and to a lesser extent the animation.  However, these themes are not used to to shock or carry the story but are actually worked in quite seamlessly.
  My first criticism against the anime is that it does not go all the way in capturing the dark feel of the comic.  Of course, even though it was a ""midnight"" anime, that can only be expected.
My second criticism is pretty much along those lines in that the series ends prematurel but that probably could not also be helped.
  Overally, I would recommend this animation for a more mature audience as the story line is truly gripping and Guts is simply a ""cool"" protoganist.  However, for those who have the option, I would recommend reading the comic book even before.",1030406400,4,2244,4.548628428927681
1688967,5,B0000639EP,"I absolutely love Berserk. Guts is full of passion, pain, and heart wrenching memories from the past. I was enthralled with him from the beginning. Now this anime has quite a bit of violence but the violence is warranted and necessary for the story. A story that is wonderful full of mystery and hidden secrets that are just waiting to be unveiled. I will be watching this over and over again. The massive power that Guts wills with his equally massive sword is amazing to watch. Finding out who and where Guts came from really interested me.
Guts is a character to remember for all time. I have to mention that in some of the fight scenes the spray of blood is amazing to watch although it is gory and may make some squeamish at times. I was not squeamish at all. I thought the blood and all the other scenes were beautiful and fantastic to watch.
Watch this anime with caution for younger viewers under age 16 who might be disturbed by the gory violence. For the rest of you out there get this anime! Berserk earns it's name and more. It has a great story, great character development, and scenes full of animated passion that will amaze you.",1029369600,3,1144,4.4523809523809526

That is what you might find tedious about this DVD.  I, for one, love the slow pacing and you will too if you just let it grow on you.
  Anyways, I'm not going reiterate the plot yet again but I must say that everything from the music to the story to the extras on this DVD are great.  The outtakes by themselves are probably worth the money!!

He my seam like some mere mercenary, but once he starts to swings his sword every man will know true fear. Don't let his fake arm make you underestimate him, it does have a few hidden tricks.

1688990,4,B0000639EP,"Berserk: the immortal sodier tells a story of a one-armed wandering swordman, Gatts, who possesses incredible physical strength and gory past. The plot of Berserk is not what you would find in conventional anime or manga. Here, you're not going to see a wizard smite dragons with magic. In contrast, the setting of berserk, in spite of being a fantasy advanture, is very realistic. There is no sorcerer or magic sword anywhere. The concept of a ""dragon slayer"" here is just a big blunt sword that so heavy that it would crush anything in two within one strike. However, the essence of Berserk is not about killing monster but rather the achievemnet in complex development of characterization. Something that has rarely been equally achieved by manga or anime.
!!SPOILER!! :Gatts, as a child born amid the fierce fighting of medival battlefield, has to struggle to learn how to fight in order to survive in a cruel world. He becomes a strong warrior and later join the Band of Hawk which is led by Griffith, a charming mercenary leader. By following Griffith, Gatts has experienced the glorious moments in his life. The Band of Hawk is invincible. They keep on winning and the unbreakable friendship between the two has firmly formed. However Griffith's unfathomable ambition leads to the destruction of the Hawk. And when Griffith decides to choose path of his dream before friends who would fight and die for him, the bond of friendship is forever turned in to hatred and despair.!!END OF SPOILER!!
I find the plot of Berserk so perfect that it could have easily become a bestseller novel if it were written as novel at the first place. This is no silly cartoon! The story, however, based originally on manga written by Kentarou Miura. To my dismay, the anime series only span up to around volume 13-14 of manga version (currently achieved the 22nd issue). Thus, the more exciting part of the story is left out just like that. Well, at least until somebody makes a sequel series which is unlikely...The only problem of this anime is that it wasn't produced on very high budget which is a shame. There are a lot of budget saving techniques here and there and that is why I give it only 4 stars. It may sound weird but I have to say that action in the manga look much more power than in the anime. I only wish that one day it may be remade as a high budget movie or OAV.
Anyway, that was just a tip I tried to give for those who are interested in manga format but cannot find it outside Japanese version. Overall, this is a brilliant series which worth checking out.

1688991,2,B0000639EP,"Unfortunately, Berserk starts strong, and gets progressive weaker.  The first episode is the actual resolution of events as they stand.  Much like the current Star Wars trilogy, you know what's going to happen, so where's the suspense?
Although it is beautifully done, it isn't very well done.  The story starts with a blast, and events get more and more repetitive until around number 18, when things get turned upside down.  Again, with the ending known at the beginning, the suspense is quite minimal.
At the end, things take a gruesome turn, and stops just short of the story actually getting interesting.
All in all, it really should have been completed before releasing.  There would be more to look forward to.  It's a good view, but not a good buy.",1023580800,2,756,4.821705426356589

Be forewarned though this is not a happy go lucky lets take a romp through the forest and fight the mean ol' dragon anime. Berserk pulls no punches. This is serious mature subject matter.

1688996,5,B0000639EP,"In short, yes I am a Berserk fanatic. But I will not go around claiming that Berserk is the greatest anime of all times, but instead I'll tell you that Berserk fills its niche in anime better than any other. Although both [other movie] and Berserk are fantasies, I consider each to fill different niches. For [other movie] it is High Magic Fantasy. For Berserk it is Dark Low Magic Fantasy with only the occasion supernatural forces interfering with characters (ie Demons and Monsters).
The anime is based on a highly intense and graphic novel that is still going, long past the events that end the series. As such, to make the anime more appropriate, less lengthy, and less packed with characters, the anime leaves items out. But the series is still highly enjoyable.
The series starts off in classic epic style, in the middle (of the manga) or in the case of the series, the end. The first episode is the present and all other episodes are flashbacks which show the character development of the lead characters:  Guts, protagonist, mercenary, and natural survivor, Griffith, ambitious, calculative, charismatic mercenary leader, and Casca the only female mercenary in the bunch. The series throws in an assortment of characters that you grow to love and cherish as the series goes on, each adding that bit of uniqueness to the world.
This disc shows the one episode Guts in his present state (one-eyed, metallic left arm, black armor, big sword, and a grudge against everything) as well as how the young Guts will be introduced to the infamous and successful mercenary group known as Band of the Hawk, which is lead by Griffith.
The animation occassionaly freezes the frame into a mangaish picture, but that does not take away from the series. The anime is rather violent, even after taking the worse scenes out from the manga, but nothing too bad. Since most people do, I might as well comment on the fact that this series is not for the weak of heart.
Overall: A great anime for diversity in your collection and a piece that should not be missed out on. This type of anime may not be best for everyone, with the action battles and all, but watching how the events unfold in Guts's life is a great pleasure.",1018310400,4,2210,4.695876288659794

This is one of the deeper anime's you will find.  The story is very involved, the characters are well developed and the situations are very extreme.  This is not a story that anyone would want spoiled for them before they saw it, so I will spare potential buyers from any dissapointment :).
