3113141,4,B0013JFYZS,"It's probable that the sea of local critical praise and awards greeting London to Brighton has more to do with the `Shock! Horror! British film not ***t!' factor than any signs of greatness, but it has to be said that at a time when most British debut features aren't even fit for the 3am graveyard slot on TV, this is more than just a pretty decent film. There's not much to it and you can see the ending coming a mile off, but it is extremely well made and acted - a simple tale well told that acts as a good calling card for all concerned and is refreshingly free of the Guy Ritchieisms that plague crime films these days. The characters are, for the most part believable and it is a proper movie rather than a digital mishmash - surprisingly it was not only shot on film, but in Scope too. It's real problem is that it's probably missed its time by about 25 years: this is the kind of film that once upon a time would have found an audience as a supporting feature rather than one people are likely to pay full price to see as a main feature. But I certainly didn't feel cheated by it, and that's an increasing rarity with no-budget films these days. And, unlike most British films - low budget or otherwise - the UK DVD has a good package of DVD extras too.",1203120000,,1262,4.2190082644628095

8251309,5,B0013JFYZS,"This movie came highly recommended and I can see why - it's inspired on every cinematic level.  However, it's not an easy film to watch - but stay with it and it'll be well worth your time and effort.  Because of the British dialects, the English subtitles were essential for me to closely follow the screenplay (one of the great benefits of watching it at home on DVD.)  An intensely cathartic experience and a brilliant directorial debut from Paul Andrew Williams.  It'll have you searching for superlatives afterwards - a must-see!",1398643200,,534,4.835164835164835
8251310,5,B0013JFYZS,Overall a good movie that you can sit home watch while you relax and enjoy some simple entertainment.  A Good Rental!,1388793600,,117,4.571428571428571
8251311,3,B0013JFYZS,"While the direction and cast of this film are top-notch, I simply found the subject matter too unrelentingly brutal to be at all entertaining or enjoyable. I normally gravitate towards films with 'realistic' plotting, but the subject matter in this film is just too grimy and unpleasant for me to recommend the film to anyone for any purpose other than appreciating the work of the actors.
Were it possible, I would have given it 3.5 stars.",1374019200,,440,4.802631578947368
8251312,5,B0013JFYZS,"Life on the streets can be rough, just ask anyone who lives there. But there are decent people struggling to stay decent on the streets. This film is a strong depiction of the battle to remain human in the face of desperation and exploitation. Kelly (Lorraine Stanley) is a prostitute forced by her pimp to find a girl for a special client. Eleven year old Joanne is a runaway who falls into her path. A realistic depiction of a seedy underbelly of British Society, with strong acting and a strong script. Disturbing and gripping. Not one for the faint hearted.",1354233600,2,561,4.62
8251313,5,B0013JFYZS,"""L to B"" is a most unusual sort of film. Rare is it that I am riveted by a film to such an extent that I ignore nature's call, but this one.....whoah. I would have refused to take my eyes off the screen even had a Chevy rammed right through the living room wall. There were no moments of lulling, no moment where you could take a breath and collect your thoughts- all you knew was that a horror was happening, had happened, or maybe hadn't happened...and oh, god what is gonna happen?  a child locked in a bathroom wearing lipstick gives you an uneasiness that can only be satisfied by not moving a muscle. Whoever called this film ""slight"" in a previous review ought to have their head examined. There is nothing at all slight about this film, its a sucker punch, one a minute, for 90 minutes.
And not only that, but the acting is so good that it isn't even acting. Sam Spruell was one of the most understated gangsters i have ever seen on screen, and he made me as nervous as Javier Bardem's cattleprod-bearing psycho did in ""No Country for Old Men"". The ending wrapped things up in a completely schizophrenic way that I don't think I could have possibly seen coming. I can't say it is one of my favorite films. It simply takes too much out of you, and is so bleak and horrifying that it is best rewatched only to give others the benefit of seeing it for the first time. But it is a masterpiece.",1296086400,,1397,4.291666666666667
8251314,2,B0013JFYZS,"This movie is not for the squeamish. If you enjoy tough scenes of violence, sexual abuse of minors and a cast of throughly evil characters, this may be right up your alley.
But, if like me, you find such things upsetting, stay away.
The movie concerns a London pimp who is asked by a client to find a young girl. With the help of an experienced prostitute, they find a young 11-year-old runaway. Violence ensues and the younger woman and the girl are on the run.
I have to say I didn't watch this all the way through. After about 45 minutes, I found the whole thing too upsetting to continue. This was not my idea of entertainment. I admit it, I'm a wimp. Others may enjoy this kind of stuff (all power to them) but if you're like me, be warned.",1252886400,2,745,4.253521126760563
8251315,4,B0013JFYZS,"This 85-minute thriller ramps up the tension from the first frame and doesn't take off the pressure for a second. Lorraine Stanley is terrific as a London prostitute who gets involved in some nasty business involving a runaway girl and a wealthy client. The following day, on the run to Brighton, with her pimp in hot pursuit, she tries to scrape up the cash to put the girl on a train to Devon.

Events, crammed into a single day, move much too fast finally for everybody, and two graves dug in the night are eventually occupied by the fated victims, though not until after the suspense has been drawn out to the breaking point. Photography and editing are as fine as the performances of the cast, and the music track is especially haunting. Rarely has the Moonlight Sonata been used in a film to underscore such a darkly grim sense of foreboding. A real nail-biter.",1250553600,,867,4.593548387096774
8251316,4,B0013JFYZS,"It is too bad that unknown films like this take years to make it over the pond. An obvious low budget character film, but everyone involved gave some convincing and sad performances. This story follows two days in the life of a prostitute and an underage girl as things fall apart after a bad client visit. The time line flashes back and forth between the event itself, the brief time before, and then the present day/time as the girls flee from London to Brighton. Obviously something bad has happened (we do not see all of it until near the end) and the affected mob family wants to locate the two girls and exact their revenge. The ending is brutal, but in a way that does not make you want to throw the disc in the garbage.

The supplements are lengthy and include:
* 8 minute making of, very logistical, non-narrated
* 24 minute Q&A session of the crew at a panel-like setting/screening
* 3.5 minute audition recording for one of the ladies
* 8.5 minutes of deleted scenes, extremely low quality, not worthy
* 1 minute alternate ending, would have been way too heartless to leave in
* 1 minute of outtakes - not even watchable, skip it

Not for the light hearted rental evening, but worth your time.",1249948800,5,1204,4.493150684931507

It's the early hours of the morning and a 12 year old girl called Joanne played by an amazing Georgia Groome and a jaded prostitute Kelly, an understated Loraine Stanley are huddling together in a London toilet, Kelly's face look like it has been put through a compactor and Joanne's clothes are ripped and torn. Told in flash backs mainly from the points of view of Kelly and Joanne, the plot follows a trail that leads back to a scene of carnage where both child and prostitute have played a part in the brutal stabbing of a man.

But this is no ordinary man who has been stabbed, (who would have thought that Golly from Monarch of the Glen could play such a gross character so well!) for starters he has a liking for little girls, he also has a son Stuart, played with delicious violence by Sam Spruell who is a violent gangster and who wants some answers and he wants them now so the Kelly and Joanne are on the run but they have no real idea what they can do to ensure their safety so they leg it to Brighton and in doing so forge a relationship that will bind them together through the most terrible of times that have yet to come.

Hunted down by Kelly's psychotic and cowardly pimp Derek on behalf of Stuart, you know it is only a matter of time before Kelly and Joanne are captured, stuffed in the boot of a car and made to come face to face with Stuart in a remote field were Derek and his friend are made to dig a grave which at first we all think is for Joanne and Kelly.
What happens next is as shocking as it is exhilarating and it is well worth seeing just for the end ten minutes of the movie.
