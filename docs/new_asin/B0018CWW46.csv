3417182,1,B0018CWW46,"Lousy script, terrible acting, predictable, cheese-ball plot, and a silly music soundtrack.  This was supposed to be a suspense thriller.  Not one shred of suspense to be found in this stinker.  Stay away.",1226793600,3,205,5.151515151515151
3417183,1,B0018CWW46,"Don't waste your time or $$ on this turkey.  An insult at best to anyone with even a little intelligence.  The volleyball sequences are terrible.  It almost looked like it was planned to be a porno flick... in fact it might have been better as one.  While not the worst movie I've seen, it certainly ranks in the top 20.",1215561600,6,320,4.283333333333333
8269588,4,B0018CWW46,"This was a very uncomplicated movie. By that I mean there were no extraneous subplots or character studies. Who knew volleyball could be so dangerous?

After a girl volleyball player is approached by a sports reporter for an interview ending in a very lust-filled date,, her opposite on a rival winning team is killed in a hit and run and she's asked to be her replacement.  The investigating police inform her the reporter is also missing and the man she met is an imposter, and the search begins... Now she has a stalker who threatens to kill her during the big Labor Day volleyball game. Of course she isn't going to back out andplay it safe, because this is her BIg Chance to play volleyball in the Olympics.

The story moves a little too swiftly which makes the movie seem shorter than it is. The identity of the stalker is a surprise. No reason is ever given for why he picked her to obsess over and there's little suspence but it's a fairly entertaining story anyway.  The only thing not formulaic is that the girl fights back, and in the big confrontation scene, does everything we've always wanted the victim to do instead of following the usual outline. Yay on that score.

Nothing epic but an entertaining way to while away a couple of hours.  And there are plenty of girls in bikinis for the guys to watch as they toss volleyballs and takes chest-dives into the sand.",1427328000,2,1379,4.540322580645161
8269589,4,B0018CWW46,I admit (shamefully) I watched this for Joe Manganiello- I must say he has come a long way (acting wise).  He's worth renting this movie.,1425686400,,137,4.48

8269592,5,B0018CWW46,"Really fun movie if you are into beach volleyball. Although the credits list not one but TWO AVP technical advisors. I'd like to know why they didn't spend any time showing the actresses that portrayed pro players how to pass, set, hit or even hold a volleyball without looking like it was their first time on the beach. There are only 4 beach volleyball movies available on DVD ( unless you count ""Air Bud"" and the kids in that move can actually play better than the dog) these being ""Sideout"" ""Beach Kings"" "" Cloud 9"" and this masterpiece, ""Impact Point"". All feature great music, hot girls, hot guys, great locations and protagonists that look like BB players competing at a world class level and defeating the likes of Sinjin and Stoklos and Gabby Reese (after acouple weeks of hard practice demonstrated by a standard 3 minute montage). Bring your willing suspension of disbelief - it will be tested . If it stays intact , you'll enjoy this , maybe a lot!",1402617600,2,960,4.619883040935672
8269593,5,B0018CWW46,"Good movie,acting is a bit corny,but the girls in bikinis makes up for it. Would recommend as a good all around movie!!!!!",1354752000,,122,4.590909090909091
8269594,2,B0018CWW46,"i actually got this dvd because ive been a brian austin green fan since i was a kid - unfortunately, i was not a fan of this movie...i did like the plot twist near the end though",1325030400,,178,3.8378378378378377
8269595,1,B0018CWW46,"""Impact Point"" features bad acting, bad direction and has only one redeeming quality: Melissa Keller.  She is gorgeous, nude and clothed.",1279670400,2,137,5.523809523809524
8269596,1,B0018CWW46,"The cover of the film says it all. Whereas most semi-decent movies have covers which facus on the faces of the stars involved, this one has a different anatomical feature front and centre.

And what a load of twaddle the content is. An asinine plot with more holes than swiss cheese, clearly where dialogue plays second fiddle to body language, heavy going to set up the plot, it is almost painful to endure.

If one defines escapist as being able to escape reality then this plot is fantastic. No, seriously, this movie has no credibility whatsoever.

By the end, I was laughing hysterically.

Not for serious consideration.",1238112000,4,625,4.813084112149533
8269597,2,B0018CWW46,"sort of like Into the Blue.  Basically, visual eye candy, the promotion of volleyball, and the beach.  Plot is cheesy, motive is not strong, and bad chemistry.  Watching without sound would make no difference.",1229731200,3,209,5.088235294117647
