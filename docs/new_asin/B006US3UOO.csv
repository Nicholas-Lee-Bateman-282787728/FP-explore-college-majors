5020188,5,B006US3UOO,"Edge is one of the all time greats! I can not wait to get this Blu-ray. Others have listed the content so I won't bother. Just wanted to say this will be an amazing set, even if there is some repeat matches. WWE has a great track record for fantastic documentaries, this should be no exception. Edge was one of the all time greatest entertainers & because of that reason his career was cut too short. I have a feeling he will be around & involved with the WWE for many years to come in one aspect or another. This blu-ray/DVD should make any WWE & Edge fan very happy.",1330646400,,568,4.172727272727273

5020197,4,B006US3UOO,another great wwe release,1391817600,,25,5.5
5020198,5,B006US3UOO,"As a career retrospective, this is great.  I say that because it's highly unlikely that we will see Edge in a WWE ring again, so for me, having this cover him starting in WCW and ending with his HOF induction is good.  This isn't like CM Punks ""Best In The World"" that while good, only goes to a certain point in his career when you know he has more to accomplish.  The documentary on here is stellar.
The matches?
Actually, pretty good.  Aside from the first few (which Edge is a jobber in every sense of the word) it's a pretty good retrospective.
I'd give this a STRONG 9 out of 10.",1390435200,,585,4.196428571428571
5020199,5,B006US3UOO,If you love wrestling or Edge then you'll love this DVD. Got this as a gift for my boyfriend's little brother and he loved it.,1387152000,,126,4.08
5020200,5,B006US3UOO,I bought this recently I thought this was a awesome documentary the matches are great I recommend this for any wrestling fan,1374710400,,124,4.681818181818182
5020201,5,B006US3UOO,"Edge has been one of my favorite wrestlers since he started with WWE. Loved seeing his life story on the DVD. Seemed like his greatest matches were on his other DVD but i'm glad they chose not to put all of those on this DVD. Loved the matches with Taker & Cena as those feuds were legendary. Great to see the chamber match on there along with his final career match.
Edge will always be one of my favorites. The ""Rated R Supterstar"" heel work was as great as it gets in WWE in any era. Tuned into Raw & Smackdown to see what he would do next. Great DVD set to own as his captures his career nicely.",1369440000,,599,4.042016806722689
5020202,4,B006US3UOO,"Adam Copeland, also known as Edge was a kid who always wanted to be the WWF/WWE and this collection adds a great deal to the last compilation of matches which includes his last one. The match selection is perfect and the bonus features add an exclamation point to the career of one of the greatest WWE superstars of all time.",1359072000,,325,4.433333333333334
5020203,5,B006US3UOO,"this was my brother's Christmas present and I watched it with him. I don't watch wrestling on a regular basis, but I almost wanted to watch this again.",1358380800,,151,4.428571428571429
5020204,5,B006US3UOO,"Well, an amazing set for an amazing performer !!! WWE is finally putting out awesome sets! And not only that, Edge hand picked his own matches! Get this, you will not be let down! Don't forget, he has another box set out there!",1357862400,,227,4.3023255813953485
5020205,5,B006US3UOO,"Awesome.  It was so sad that Edge's career got cut short by an injury.  He really could work the ring and the crowd.  I miss him not being on WWE.  The ""You Think You Know Me?"" was wonderful.  Now I have something to watch again when there is nothing on the 100+ channels we have.",1357516800,,280,4.0181818181818185
5020206,5,B006US3UOO,"This is going to be a gift for my daughter, but I know is going to be great. Edge is the best.",1354147200,,94,3.3181818181818183
5020207,4,B006US3UOO,Very cool story of the man called Edge aka Adam Copeland. I've been a big wrestling fan pretty much my whole life & I've seen wrestlers come & go but Edge is definitely a wrestler that truly loved what he did. He grew up as a fan of wrestling & always believed he would be a superstar himself. This is a great story & definitely worth getting,1349136000,,342,4.119402985074627
5020208,5,B006US3UOO,This is a very good mix of the bio part and good match selections. I would strongly recommend this to any wrestling fan of edge or any wrestling fan period you learn a lot about him.,1347408000,,182,4.083333333333333
5020209,5,B006US3UOO,"First, this will not contain any spoilers but one for Summerslam 2001; and second, for Edge fans(myself included), and new fans of WWE, this set is a must-have, and another big winner from WWE Home Video.

Edge has been my favorite wrestler since I started watching when I was 11, watching my first event Summerslam 2001, when he opened with a championship win. That was my first taste of WWE(at the time, WWF), and Edge made a fan out of me that would follow his entire career, and every great moment is caught on the documentary, as well as some lesser known things about the man behind ""Edge"" the character, Adam Copeland, and a lot of controversy thrown in between.

I can't stress this enough, this documentary on Mr. Copeland is amazing. I came in to this set already respecting this man, and I had enjoyed watching him compete for almost half my life so far already. Needless to say, it would be hard to get me to be an even bigger fan of his. After watching this great doc, I've come out with even more love and respect for this man.

With interviews from many friends, family members, WWE/F Employees(current and former), there is a lot of fascinating insight into Copeland's career and personal life included. The format in which this documentary takes place is fun and engaging to watch, too. Bouncing between a radio interview before Edge appreciation night, a interview at home with the man himself, and other various footage; that may sound too eclectic, but trust me, it works well. The way it flows makes this almost 2 hour documentary an easy watch.

The match selection is also quite impressive; with some of his most prolific battles including bouts with John Cena, The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, and his last match from 'Mania 27 with Del Rio, this set really doesn't disappoint. The closest thing to disappointed I felt was shocked when I realized there wasn't a tag match between just the Hardy's and E & C. But that subsided when the 4 team elimination tag match turned out  to be pretty damn good.

Overall, this set is a wonderful collection and a fitting tribute to The ""Rated-R Superstar!"" Edge, and the man he always was, Adam Copeland. Totally Reeking of awesomeness, and an easy recommendation for any WWE fan looking for something good to watch.",1345593600,,2277,4.694235588972431
5020210,5,B006US3UOO,boyfriend loved the dvd got it as a gift for our anniversary. He's a big wrestling fan and the dvd was perfect!,1343260800,,111,4.090909090909091
5020211,5,B006US3UOO,"This DVD totally reeks of awesomeness!!  The documentary was very well done.  I love when WWE does these 2 hour documentaries for the dvd rather than just a DVD with 9 hours of matches.  I also saw that the matches were chosen by none other than Edge himself, which makes the matches on the DVD that much more memorable.  I must say that I think the match collection on the DVD is great as well.  Overall this is a MUST HAVE for Edge fans or WWE fans in general.",1343001600,,462,4.146067415730337
5020212,5,B006US3UOO,"I've been a fan of Edge for quite a while, and watching the DVD has made me appreciate character Edge and the man behind him, Adam.

The documentary was just perfect as if explained his entire life and wrestling career, and the story between him and Christian was something you rarely hear about - two boyhood friends, becoming WWE/World Champions in the business. The matches were great too; however, I think it would be better if they added more of Brood matches and some of his WWE title reign matches, too. But, still a great overall documentary.",1339200000,,550,4.670103092783505
5020213,5,B006US3UOO,"I GOT THIS DVD BECAUSE AFTER FOLLOWING THE  WRESTLING CAREER OF ADAM(EDGE)COPELAND, AND ALTHOUGH NOT WANTING TO BUT NEEDING TO RETIRE BECAUSE OF HIS  SEVERE KNEE INJURY,YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN A WRESTLER(IN THIS CASE) RETIRES ANY AND ALL OF HIS WWE MERCH./""SWAG"" AS SOME REFER TO IT ARE MORE (SHOULD I SAY?MEANINGFUL/MORE LIKELY TO GO FASTER THAN NORMAL.HE WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRESTLERS!THANK YOU AGAIN GUY'S GREAT BUY!",1337126400,,447,5.027027027027027
5020214,5,B006US3UOO,"Edge talks about what his life was like before he started wrestling and what it was like being a professional wrestler. When Edge was 16, he went to Wrestlemania 6 in Toronto, Ontario and got to see his favorite wrestler Hulk Hogan in real life.

5020216,4,B006US3UOO,"Adam Copeland is one of those performers who I can try to find way to introduce & describe him but if I try to say something, I'll end up leaving something out because there is so many words to sum up his career but I think it was two things were perfectly said in the documentary itself...""He's had a Hall Of Fame career at every stage of his career...He's Someone The WWE Universe has seen grown up right before their eyes.""  After being in WWE for close to 15 years, his story is finally told here as this is the first documentary that covers his career from the beginning to the end (and a little bit afterwords).  You'll hear from Edge himself along with others including his mother, Christian, former trainers Ron Hutchington & Sweet Daddy Siki, Rhyno, Bret Hart, Michael Hayes, Curt Hawkings, Zack Ryder, Mick Foley, William Regal, Matt Striker, Trish Stratus, Lita, The Miz, Dr. Jay Youngblood, Matt Hardy, Chris Jericho, Jim Ross, John Cena, Batista, C.M. Punk, Vickie Guerrero, Randy Orton, and ""Bending The Rules"" co-star Jamie Kennedy.

The presentation beings talking about Adam growing up & how the traumatic death of a family member drew him to wrestling, meeting Christian, going to WrestleMania VI, and how he was such a huge fan that it was noted in his high school yearbook.  How an essay lead to him training was talked about next with memories being recalled of his first bump along with how he went to college with the intent of how it was going to help his wrestling career before going on the road doing shows, meeting Rhyno, and barely getting by on what he was making.  His big break in a match working for WWE to the point where he got compliments, him starting to do tours with veterans before having a tryout match against Michael Hayes was discussed next going into the creation of ""Edge"" to the point where even he was unsure of what the character was before the creation of The Brood & how he would steal the spotlight despite not being the leader of the group.  His partnership with Christian was spotlighted in how their breakout match at No Mercy changed the ladder match forever, how the feuds with the Dudleys & Hardys redefined the tag team division, and various moments like winning their first tag titles along with Edge's memorable spear at Mania X-7.  A big part of the documentary came here in the evolution of their characters with how Edge & Christian were able to be heels yet be very entertaining with the various things they did along with their interaction with others like Kurt Angle.  His singles career was talked about next with Regal recalling his matches with him, King Of The Ring, and how his feud against Kurt Angle really helped him before talking about how special it was for Edge to form a tag team with Hulk Hogan.  When Edge started to experience his next problems & his neck injury was talked about before going into the turning point for his character that started his elevation into the main event & the Money In The Bank concept followed by going into a big part of the documentary came here with both Edge & Lita talking about the personal issues with Matt Hardy that resulted in so much heat & negativity that they it only helped him & added a dimension to his character in the end.  The shock of him cashing in his Money In The Bank was discussed next along with the (almost comedic) reaction & thoughts of the live sex celebration the next night before going into his true feelings on the short title reign & his match with Foley at Mania including the one spot that he demanded to take.  His feud with Cena was discussed next by both men with memories of various moments with how Cena felt that his elevated him & how Edge just had fun before going into his feud with Batista.  Edge's relationship with Hawkins & Ryder were talked about next along with how Vickie felt that he helped her so much before going into his feud with Undertaker & how that was his favorite.  Edge's being the ""ultimate opportunist"" character was discussed next before going into how he started to have issues with his neck again to the point where it was noticeable during a TV segment leading into his match at WrestleMania & his retirement afterwords with how a call from Steve Austin really helped him before ending the documentary on his new acting career & his appreciation night.  Now this documentary is setup similar to other recent releases (like Randy Orton or Jeff Hardy's) where at times during the presentation, it keeps going back to a specific date or incident which in this case was a radio interview he did the morning of the ""Edge Appreciation Night"" edition of SmackDown in Toronto with Adam talking about various things like how his life is different now, how was able to easily deal with his retirement, and how he was able able to separate Adam from ""Edge.""

DVD extras include a story of how a ninja star was involved in his & Christian's friendship, his time working in WCW & why he didn't stick around, the on screen relationship between Edge & Christian & Mick Foley, and the one important promo of his career that Edge felts tapped into where his character needed to go.  Blu-Ray extras include bonus stories of a road trip with Christian & Rhyno that almost cost them their lives, going into how Edge was able to heal his ankle injury quicker than expected, how he was able to give someone the same opportunity he had through an essay contest, and a look at his pet dogs.  Other Blu-Ray extras include his retirement speech on RAW & his appreciation night ceremony after SmackDown with Trish Status, Christian, Rhyno, and Bret Hart.

Matches Include:
Adam Impact vs. Christian Cage - This is a match from Edge's pre-WWE career with commentary done by him & Matt Striker discussing various things like how the talent would work both as wrestlers & referees as evident by a former ECW/WCW talent Johnny Swinger being the referee for this match, how they were basically ""babysitters"" during this event, how much they made on this show, comparing the business back then to today, and advice for the future.  The match itself was more of a background for the commentary but you will notice both men doing moves that they didn't do in WWE while Edge's ring gear was definitely different than we've seen him in before.
South Indian Lake 1995

w/Christian vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Too Cool vs. Hardy Boyz vs. T & A - This wasn't the usual fatal four way match as this was held under elimination rules where all three teams had to be eliminated in order to win the match & we got a very special 5 second pose before the match just for the city of Boston.  This was one of those matches that was able to showcase everyone's strengths in the time that they had them such as Edge & Christian's ability to double team, T&A's strength advantage, the quickness of the Hardys, and the entertaining ability of Too Cool while getting some added action from Lita both in & out of the ring.  Good tag match featuring all four teams.
King Of The Ring '00

No Disqualification Match vs. Eddie Guerrero - Eddie came out very aggressive from the start knocking Edge down & stomping on him before tossing Edge across the ring with a monkey flip.  Edge started to bring out weapons like a ladder only for the referee to accidentally get hit in the process with Eddie responding getting a chair & using it on Edge's back while Edge was able to later counter top rope frankensteiner with a snap powerbomb.  The ladder continued to be used such as Eddie doing a hilo onto Edge who was sandwiched between it, Eddie landing directly on his neck after being backdropped onto a ladder in the corner, and an Edgeucation off the top of the ladder.  This was very intense & physical from start to finish to the point where despite being the heel, Eddie got a standing ovation in a losing effort.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '02
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary; Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Randy Orton - This was the rematch from the previous Vengeance PPV that saw Orton heavily focus on Edge's head with moves like a chinlock & even backdropping Edge on the security barrier with his head to hit the floor in the audience that caused his mouth to bleed.  This match got real competitive as it went on with moments like Edge getting his receipt with the security barrier later on, both men attempting a crossbody block only to have a mid-air collision, both men taking each others signature moves only to keep coming, and one man having to steal a page out of the others playbook to get the victory.  While this wasn't as long as their PPV match, this was more aggressive.
""RAW"" July '04

Loser Leaves Raw/Money In The Bank Ladder Match vs. Matt Hardy - The final encounter between these two (three if you involve Lita) in this very personal feud against each other to the point where they dished out the most punishment possible & not hold anything back.  Both men took some hard hits & delivered them with the ladder such as Edge being squeezed in an upside down ladder sissors, Matt being either dropped into or back suplexed or hitting face first into the top or suplexed into the ladder stomach first, a sequence that starts with Edge being shoved off a ladder & ends with Matt crashing & burning off another ladder, Matt's crossbody off the ladder onto Edge in the crowd, Twist Of Fate off the top of ladders, and Lita getting involved along with weapons like kendo sticks & tables.  This was unlike their previous matches as a tag team where it was one spot after another as this was came off more like a fight that was very aggressive from beginning to end.
""RAW"" Oct. '05
[The Ladder Match]

WWE Championship/T.L.C. Match vs. John Cena - Edge's had the heavy advantage going into this match as he returned home to a hero's welcome in Toronto as the WWE Champion defending with his own ""Rated R"" WWE Championship in the match he's the innovator & master of.  Edge showcased this fact by dishing out the punishment like giving Cena a DDT into chairs, dropkicking the ladder off the guardrail into Cena's face, powerslamming him through a table, running up a ladder to the top rope followed by a crossbody to Cena on the outside, a ladder to ladder spear, and Lita getting involved causing both men to crash through tables.  Cena himself gave as much as he took to Edge by hip tossing him into the ladder & later delivering his throwback into a chair, applying his STFU with Edge trapped in the ladder, F.U.ing the ladder onto Edge, powerbombing Edge into the ladder, and giving Edge the biggest F.U. we've ever seen.
Unforgiven '06
[The Ladder Match]

Street Fight vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the second street fight between these men on RAW with the first one happening two years earlier. During this time, Randy Orton & Edge teamed together to form ""Rated RKO"" in an effort to take out D-Generation X and they already accomplished half of that with Triple H being out of action due to injury. This was a different Shawn than we were used to at the time because he was all business & serious from the start as he used his belt & a trash can in the early moments while other weapons like steel steps, a ladder, a biker chain would come into play with Edge also taking a hard chair shot. Both men were heavily bleeding in this match that can only really be described in two words: physically intense.
""RAW"" Jan. '07
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary]

World Championship Match vs. Undertaker - Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually delivers...and this was no exception. Edge worked on Taker's back throughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose. Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (Devil's Gate).
WrestleMania XXIV
[Top 50 Superstars]

vs. Christian - These two had a confrontation with each other on the night Edge left for RAW while Christian came to SmackDown (seen on the SmackDown 09-10 DVD) so Christian came to RAW for this match. With these men having such a long history, they were able to counter each others such as the spear & Killswitch. Christian's arm was worked over here & played a heavy factor in the closing moments.
""RAW"" May '10
[Best Of RAW: 2010]

World Championship/T.L.C. Match vs. Kane vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was originally suppose to be a singles T.L.C. match between Kane & Edge while Mysterio & Del Rio meeting in a Tables match but both matches were merged together only a few days earlier while it should be noted that Mysterio's outfit was a nice tribute to the rock band KISS. As expected with a multiman T.L.C. match, this was full of action such as Rey pushed off a ladder onto Kane & Edge on the outside, Del Rio being tossed around on the outside by both Kane & Edge, Kane's dominance at one point leading to double & triple teaming, Kane being put through a table more than once, a double spear by Edge, Mysterio using a table from the stage, how Edge was able to block the 619, the nasty face first fall from the ladder by Edge & Mysterio, Del Rio's fall off the ladder through a table, and Ricardo Rodriquez (or ""Eddie Munster"" as Striker likes to call him) getting involved. Excellent match if you just love clusters of hard hitting spots & bumps with everyone at various times looking like they were capable of winning the championship.
T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders & Chairs '10

World Championship/Elimination Chamber Match vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Big Show vs. Kane vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Wade Barrett - With Dolph Ziggler being fired on the previous SmackDown, Big Show took his place. As expected, this match was full of various highlights such as Edge sliding Mysterio out of the ring to the chamber walls over the grated chamber floor, Kane's dominance including throwing Mysterio head first into the glass, Wade Barrett being cheered by the crowd, Big Show's chop to McIntyre that was so loud...it knocked the wind out of Josh Matthews, Barrett getting tossed through a pod by Show with one hand, everyone realizing they had to work together to take out the biggest threat in the match, Edge's double spear, and the showdown between the final two. The standout performance here though came from Drew McIntyre as we saw a more aggressive side of him than we've seen before as he had no problem getting in everyone's face before going into the pod, spearing Mysterio into a chamber pod's glass like a dart, throwing Barrett though another glass pod, and targeting Edge because of Kelly Kelly getting fired. Josh Matthews described this match perfectly, ""Car crash after car crash!"" Stay tuned afterwords as not only did the road to the World Championship match at WrestleMania start but we also saw the return of someone who also had unfinished business.
Elimination Chamber '11
[Best PPV Matches Of 2011]

World Championship Match vs. Alberto Del Rio - Alberto Del Rio wins the biggest Royal Rumble in the history of WWE to fulfill his ""destiny"" in main event WrestleMania for the World Championship...and it's the first match on the card? Anyways it should be noted that while Del Rio had Ricardo & his ex-NXT rookie Brodus Clay (who actually lost NXT to another guy who we haven't seen on TV since while Brodus is on TV every week) in his corner, Edge had Christian (who had beaten Del Rio twice leading up to this match) in his corner. Del Rio focused heavily on Edge's arm that he had been re-injuring for the past few weeks such as throwing Edge into the steps & ringside barrier arm first while also slamming it on the announce table, applying various armbars, armdragging Edge off the top rope, and even Clay ramming his arm into the ringpost leading him to dominate the first half of the match. Edge was able to start gaining back momentum & even was able to reverse the cross armbreaker into his submission hold (which is called the Edgecator in the video games) at one point while Christian took matters into his own hands with both Ricardo & Clay on the outside. Edge eventually was able to walk away with the World Title victory that had avoided him at the past 3 Mania's but pay attention afterwords as what happened to Del Rio's car wasn't pretty.
WrestleMania XXVII

(Blu-Ray) No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion vs. Jeff Hardy - Chavo Guerrero was in Edge's corner for this match & Vickie Guerrero made it a No DQ match. I can never remember Jeff Hardy (who looked very similar to the Joker from ""The Dark Knight"") & Edge having a bad match and this was no exception as they just worked well together with the No DQ rule making various highlights like Hardy's dangerous leap off the ladder onto Chavo before the ending that was a shock to everyone involved with the match. Great match between these two but again, when did they have a bad one?
Royal Rumble '09

This release was very similar to The Rock's recent set in that I loved how the documentary covered most of his career (you can't include everything) while also addressing his life after wrestling.  Also like The Rock's DVD, I loved is that there wasn't any repeats from his previous anthology of matches while the repeats that were on here were on releases so long ago (minus the Chamber match) that it really didn't matter.  In the end, this along was a great complimentary piece to his match anthology years earlier that I would recommend to add to your collection.",1334534400,11,17762,4.599873577749684
5020217,5,B006US3UOO,"Wow. What an awesome set that was worth the wait and the price. WWE never ceases to amaze me when it comes to their documentaries. I really don't wanna spoil it for you because Edge has been one of my favorites, both as a face and heel since he came to WWE in the summer of 98. But I do wanna tell you what you should watch multiple times:

The entire documentary! I really wanted to hear Edge's story for a long time now and was disappointed when A Decade Of Decadence was just a compilation of matches. But looking back on it now, I'm glad they waited till now to have his story be told because now, his whole career from start to finish is told whereas if his story was told on his Decade Of Decadence dvd, it would still some more years left in his career. If you're a fan of Edge or a wrestling fan in general, this is a must watch documentary in my opinion from start to finish. Another great documentary from WWE!

Matches:
DISC 2

Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. T & A vs. Too Cool - 4-Team Elimination Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship (KOTR) - Four of the top teams at the time comprised of eight young, hungry men. When you have young, hungry athletes, you're bound to see a great match in my opinion. And while this was not the best tag team match E&C and The Hardys were in together, this was indeed great.

No Disqualification Match
Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero - No DQ match (09/26/02) - I think this was after Unforgiven making this their first meeting. And it was their best one in my opinion. They really worked their asses off. I loved every minute of it.

Edge vs. Matt Hardy - Loser Leaves Raw ""MITB"" Ladder Match (10/03/05) - With this being a Ladder match and these two being Ladder specialists, I knew this would be damn good. And it was. This totally reeked of awesomeness.

Edge vs. John Cena - TLC match for the WWE Title (Unforgiven 2006) - Anytime you see Edge in a TLC match, you're getting something good. One of Cena's best matches as Edge was one of his best rivals. As good as this was, I was kinda hoping for a TLC match that Edge actually won. There have been better TLC bouts too. But without question, this was not bad by any standards.

DISC 3

The Undertaker vs Edge - World Heavyweight Championship Match (WM24): Edge stated many times that this was one of his favorite opponents and matches. Watch and you'll see why like I did. Edge lost. But he tested Taker more than anyone else before him except for maybe Kane at WM14. Some will agree with that. Some won't. What can't be denied is beyond a shadow of a doubt, out of all his one on one matches at WM regardless of whether they were for any Title or not, this was his best singles match at WM. Taker's entrances are always a spectacle and a sight to see. But this was one of Edge;'s best entrances ever.

Edge vs. Kane vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto Del Rio - Fatal 4 Way TLC match for the WHC (TLC 2010): I thought this would be better than it was. It wasn't bad. I loved it. But it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Maybe it's because I'm not used to a 4 man TLC match. Who is? The only time there's been multiple men in a TLC match is when it's teams competing against each other. There were no teams here so it was hard for me to get used to 4 men in a TLC match. Aside from that, it was good.

Edge vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Big Show vs. Kane vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Wade Barrett - WHC Elimination Chamber match (Elimination Chamber 2011): One of the best Elimination Chamber matches I've seen. Everyone really put all they had out there.

Edge vs. Alberto Del Rio - WHC (WM27) - Fitting way to end the collection of matches. Not to mention this was a hell of a way to end what was already being seen as a HOF career. Think about it. His last match was at a WM and he walked in as the WHC and left as the winner a.k.a. still the the WHC. What WWE superstar can ask for more? It was a great match. But it doesn't top Taker vs Edge.

Special Features:
Credgeley - This is a combination of Christian, Edge and Mick Foley's names. It's something Mick came up with. Very funny stuff. They talk about some of their hilarious moments together. If you need something to make you laugh, this is it.

""Real Emotion"" promo on Matt Hardy - Before the promo aired, Edge spoke about how a quarter of the matches he wanted to have on the set didn't make it because there wasn't enough time. But he really wanted to get this one in as a bonus. As he states himself, this is the promo that he first felt like he needed to tap into going forward. He said it was the first time he was angry in a promo and the first time he really tapped into that emotion. According to him, this promo was not written. And I could tell. His emotion, his real emotion was there. It felt like there was no acting here at all. One of the best promos in the history of the business in my opinion. The promo I'm talking about is the one he delivered on Matt Hardy on RAW (August 8, 2005), one week after Matt Hardy was rehired after being fired. I really don't wanna say anymore on this because words cannot do it justice. This is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!

Blu Ray Exclusives:
Edge vs. Jeff Hardy - WWE Title (Royal Rumble 2009) - Great match between these two. One of their best encounters. This was where the Jeff Hardy/Matt Hardy feud began,

Edge Announces His Retirement - This aired on RAW (April 11, 2011). It was a very emotional speech. While I was listening to his speech, vivid flashbacks of his career went through my mind like a video highlight reel or sorts. And I remember that after WM was over, I was expecting a triple threat WHC match between him, Christian and Alberto Del Rio and now here I am listening to Edge announcing his retirement.

Edge Appreciation Night - This was for the live crowd only so the only way we could see it is by watching it on the blu ray version of this set. It took place September 13, 2011 in Edge's hometown of Toronto. I think that's why they waited a couple of months after he announced his retirement to do this. A lot of people from Edge's past as well as Christian, Trish, his mom, Rhyno and Bret Hart all made appearances before members of the WWE roster came out. Trish, Christian, and Bret all said wonderful things. Edge was visibly uncomfortable though which he admitted to being. But it was a hell of an appreciation night and deservingly so.

My only complaint is they should have added some more of Edge's matches with Taker & Cena. Edge is one of a handful of guys that always brought the best out of Cena and Edge and Taker had some of the best matches together I've ever seen. I would've also liked to see MITB 1 from WM21 which Edge won and some more Edge & Christian tag team matches. Especially their Ladder/TLC matches. Aside from those minor complaints, this is definitely worth the price. Considering what is on here, you can't complain about the price.",1334102400,5,6895,4.235159817351598
5020218,5,B006US3UOO,"Edge has always been one of my favorite wrestlers. I've followed his career since his debut back in the summer of 1998 and he was one of the biggest reasons I continued to watch WWE after the vaunted Attitude Era had concluded. I was shocked and saddened when he retired unexpectedly last April so I was thrilled when I learned about this 3 disc set. I picked up the first day it was available and it's easily one of the best dvd sets WWE has put out in awhile.

The first disc contains a near two hour documentary about Edge's life and career. We hear from all the major players in his life, from his mom, to his best friend (and fellow WWE superstar) Christian, his trainers and his friends, including former ECW and WWE star Rhyno. The doc covers Edge's early years as a wrestling fan in Toronto and how watching Hulk Hogan vs the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VI made him want to be a wrestler. We then go to Edge's training and his time on the indy circut, to his try-out match with WWE vs. Bob Holly, to his debut, the brood, the feud between the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boys and his neck surgery. We hear comments from both Edge and Lita about their affair and the subsequent fall-out. The doc then discusses Edge's first title win, working with Mick Foley at Wrestlemania, and his feud with the Undertaker. We then have a look at the last few months of his career and his eventual retirement. We get a look at Edge's blooming acting career and finally Edge reflecting on his career. The doc is also intercut with Edge being interviewed by a Toronto radio station and footage of him at his cabin. Several superstars, such as John Cena, Randy Orton, Trish Stratus and CM Punk, also comment on Edge and his career. Througout the doc, Edge is candid and honest and even if you know all the stories he tells, it's still cool to hear it from the man himself.

The 2nd and 3rd discs have matches hand-picked by Edge. We get a a rare 1995 match between Christian and himself (complete with commentary by Edge and Matt Striker). Also included are matches with The Hardy Boyz, Randy Orton, John Cena, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker and more. What I liked most about the matches is that none of them were on Edge's previous dvd set ""A Decade of Decadance"". They may not be his most high-profile matches, but all of them are great and show how consistant Edge was at putting on great matches throughout his career.

Overall I give this set a 5/5. If you're a fan of Edge, it's a no-brainer must-buy. If you're a casual fan or maybe on the fence about the ""Rated R Superstar"" then I suggest you watch it and you may gain a new respect for the man.",1334102400,4,2647,4.3869653767820775
5020219,5,B006US3UOO,"Edge talks about his beginnings and his awful injuries the friendships he made in his childhood to young adult and throughout his career. Other wrestler like Christian, William Regal, CM Punk, Trish Stratus and many more tell their stories of Edge. Just an all-around great Blu-ray DVD about Edge and some fun extras I think if you're a true fan of wrestling and a fan of Edge you will really enjoy this. It totally reeks of awesomeness!!!!!!

is being interviewed along w/ his friends/family & several people from WWE!
