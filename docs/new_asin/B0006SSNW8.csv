2193771,4,B0006SSNW8,"Despite the flat looking undercard for the event, NYR 2006 turns out to be a great show.  The PPV series only ran for a few years, but this time around is easily the best.  The show headlines some surprisingly interesting storylines, and some great traditional wrestling to go with it.

Intercontinental Title:
Edge w/ Lita vs. Ric Flair
I don't know why WWE chooses to put Ric Flair in the opener, as they have did several times in 2005/2006.  The action is the usual Ric Flair job: the expected chops, back body drops, and thumbs to the eye.  But innovation saves the slow pace.  Flair and Edge both take some hard hits, each with some uncharacteristic aggression from both.  It's even somewhat comical to see a 60 year old man ""pelvic thrust"" at Lita, and then put her in a figure four leg lock.  The ending with the disqualification is pretty sleazy though.

Women's Title:
Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James
I don't think this one is quite as strong as their match at Wrestlemania 22, but it's easily a very above average divas match.  There is a lot of technical mastery by each woman here.  Live crowds rarely get into diva matches as much as they did here.  The storyline was very enjoyable, and I found myself digging this one very much.  Highly recommended as James and Stratus do some good work.

Gregory Helms vs. Jerry Lawler
So Gregory Hemls finally drops the ridiculous ""Hurricane"" gimmick, and is given a quick push with his new persona.  This grudge match with ""The King"" is a pretty pleasant surprise.  Lawler looks pretty good here with Helms, and actually shows some finesse and athleticism with minimal fatigue.  I like the push for Helms, and this expected disaster, despite some parts where it slows down a little too much, is a pretty good watch.

Triple H vs. The Big Show
I think I'll go on the record to say that this is probably one of, if not The Big Show's best matches.  It was odd that both of these guys were left out of the elimination chamber match later on in the night, but it was quite OK after seeing this one.  Triple H uses some great ring psychology, working over Show's injured hand most of the match.  Surprisingly, Big Show leaves his feet more times than I have ever seen in his matches, and does a brilliant job at selling the hand injury.  For the Big Show's standards, this is also probably his most technically sound match as well (that's a generous statement).  In addition to a couple of big OUCH moments and an interesting ending, this match is very strong.

Shelton Benjamin w/ ""Momma"" vs. Viscera:
Originally, I thought I was going to HATE this match, but turned out that I actually LIKED it.  It was kind of a theme on the night, the big men actually putting together some decent matches.  I'd never really liked Viscera since his return, especially with the ""love machine"" gimmick, but there was no denying the charisma, comedy, and a small shimmer of technical work.  Benjamin, needless to say, looks great in this one.  Look for some spanking, humping, and a disappointing ending when Momma hits Viscera in the head with her purse (which later turns out to be a brick).  The ending was a little ugly, but that was the only thing I found wrong with this one.

Bra & Panties Gauntlet Match:
Maria vs. Candice Michelle vs. Torrie Wilson vs. Mae Young vs. Victoria vs. Ashley Messaro
OK-- well I won't go as far as saying that this is actually a good match or anything; in fact, it is quite horrible.  I won't be too hard on it however.. the women looked hot of course, and this is something we won't see in today's PG-rated television.  If you remotely care about this kind of thing, give this a look.

WWE Title Elimination Chamber:
John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Kane vs. Carlito vs. Chris Masters vs. Kurt Angle
To start, I really liked WWE's choice to put Carlito and Masters into this main event, and then to top it off, they eliminate Michaels, and start to get us to believe that one of them might win the title.  Short lived, of course, but this elimination chamber is a quite good one.  There isn't as much violence and use of the cage as there usually is in chamber matches, but the storytelling and smart booking made this one work.  The live Albany crowd didn't seem to like the ending too much as Cena had held the title for the better part of the year.. but WAIT, there's still one more surprise.  Edge comes out to cash in his money in the bank that he had been holding the whole previous year.  It's a great shock, and an even better way to end the show.

Overall, like I said in the intro, New Year's Revolution 2006 is a great show.  I was reluctant to not give it a 5-star rating, but there is nothing that is CLASSIC on this disc.  Nonetheless, each match is very watchable, and most are very good.  I would definitely check this one out.",1303776000,,4812,4.4713302752293576
2193772,3,B0006SSNW8,"World Tag Team Championship
Eugene & Willim Regal(c) vs. Christian & Tyson Tomko
I thought it was a decent way to open the show. Eugene came out in Hulk Hogan attire. There were some decent stuff in this match. Eugene dislocated his Kneecap in this match. Which lead to a horrible ending to the match. **1/4

Women's Championship
Lita(c) vs. Trish Stratus
I didn't like this match at all. It was short and very sloppy. In this match lita get her leg messed up and Trish got the win and became a six time Women's Champion.
3/4*

Intercontinental Championship
Shelton Benjamen(c) vs. Maven
This was other bad match it was very short with like two moves in the whole match. Maven just kept messing with the crowd and it got really annoying. In the end Shelton just hit the T-Bone and got the win. DUD

Muhammad Hassan vs. Jerry Lawler
I thought this match was decent, but could have been a lot better. Hassan did like six bodyslams in the whole match. Hassan contolled most of the match with Lawler having a couple of shots. It was a decent ending with Hassan getting the win.**1/4

Kane vs. Gene Snitsky
This was a pretty good match. The story behind this match was really good. The match had a good pace with a lot of power moves. In the end Kane hit Snitsky with the Tombstone and got the win.**3/4

Elimination Chamber Match for the Vacant World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H vs. Batista vs. Edge vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit
I thought this was an amazing match. There was alt of spots in the match that I enjoyed. Edge Was the first one eliminated by sweet chin music from the guest referee Shawn Michaels. The next one eliminated was Chris Benoit with a spine buster on Jericho by Batista. The next one eliminated was Chris Jericho With a Batista Bomb By Batista. The next one eliminated was Batista by a RKO by Randy Orton. Then Triple H eliminated Randy Orton with the Pedigree and help from Batista. So Triple H one the World Hevyweight Championship.***3/4

Overall it was a pretty bad show, but I would buy for Elimination Chamber Match. I give the show an Overall Rating of 6.5/10.",1266105600,,2115,4.5380577427821525
2193773,3,B0006SSNW8,"Intercontinental Championship
Ric Flair Vs. Edge - This isn't a bad contest however it dosesn't touches on their TLC Match 2 weeks later. It was actually good until the DQ ending. Edge and Flair gave us an entertaining match and it was a good start to the show. The DQ ending was a good touch to the match which would play out later in the night. 3.5/5

WWE Women's Championship
Trish Stratus Vs. Mickie James - Of course this match isn't on the same caliber of their WrestleMania match but this was still a solid Women's Title Match. Mickie doesn't look as sharp in this match as she did at WrestleMania but she still put on a good match with Trish. 3.25/5

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler Vs. Gregory Helms - Normally this match wouldn't be on the card but due to all the talent being used up in the ECM, this match was put on the card as a filler. However, this match produced a good showing from both men. Lawler didn't look that rusty and he can still go with someone who is young like Gregory Helms. This isn't a wrestling clinic but better then expected. Not a total squash match by any means. 3/5

Triple H Vs. Big Show - This was kind of a big let down. The broken hand storyline was a nice touch to the match and it did spice up the match a little bit but basically this match didn't deliver. HHH did a good job targetting the injured hand of Big Show and using such elements as steel chairs and the steel ring post. But overall this match just drag on for too long and became more boring as it progressed. In the end, HHH struck Big Show with the sledgehammer and following it up with a Pedigree (which looked a little weak) for the win. 3/5

Shelton Benjamin Vs. Viscera - Quite honestly, I saw nothing good in this match. Shelton's talent was being totally wasted here and this match did nothing for his career. And to add, Shelton's mama screaming at ringside just made the match annoying to watch. Just a very un-entertaining match. 2/5

Bra And Panties Gauntlet Match
Ashley Vs. Maria Vs. Torrie Wilson Vs. Candice Michelle Vs. Victoria Vs. Mae Young - Again, I saw nothing good in this match either. In my eyes the match was a total trainwreck and even Mae Young's and Fabulous Moolah's comical apperaence wasn't that entertaining and actually made the match more boring. Another lousy match but some people might enjoy however I didn't. 1/5

Elimination Chamber Match for the WWE Championship
John Cena Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Carlito Vs. Chris Masters Vs. Kane - I actually found this to be an enjoyable and good main event. The shocker here was Kurt Angle being the first man eliminated after his brief dominating time in the match. This ECM doesn't rank up there up with the previous 3 Elimination Chamber Matches (minus SummerSlam 2003) in match quality but it doesn't rank as the worst either. In the end, John Cena did what nobody has done before in an ECM and thats enter the match first and win it. Again, a very enjoyable WWE Title Elimination Chamber Match. 4.5/5

WWE Championship
Edge Vs. John Cena - Right after the previous Elimination Chamber Match came to an end, Mr. McMahon came out and announced that Edge was cashing in his Money In The Bank privlege he earned at Wrestlemania 21. Edge went for the pin right away but a bloody John Cena kicked out. After a few minutes, Edge hit Cena with two spears to finally win his first ever WWE Title. This was indeed one of the greatest moments in Pro Wrestling's history. 3/5 (Also Available On ""Edge: Decade Of Decadence"")

Overall, I was very generous to give this PPV a 3 star rating. If it wasn't for the seemingly good Elimination Chamber Match and the unexpectingly surprise finish, this would have be given a 2 star rating. I recommend this event between the 5$-10$ range. Other then that, I wouldn't purchase this event for over 10 dollars. You can find the last match on Edge's DVD if that is all you want to see from this PPV.",1243382400,,3921,4.458856345885635

2193775,4,B0006SSNW8,"Spoiler !!

Not a bad Ppv.

I was glad that John Cena finally lost his WwE title to Edge. To bad though that the WwE got rid of the Masterpiece since he showed a lot of potential in this match more so that John Cena has shown in the last few years combined.

The bikini part wasn't all that bad but it really slows down the regular action in the ppv.

The Triple H vs Big Show fight was great though it was very obvious there was nothing wrong with the Big Shows hand.

Edge vs Ric Flair. It was nice to see Flair covered with blood thanks to Edge though i am partial since i always disliked Ric Flair and his whoo's !!

Overall not a bad Ppv definitly glad i bought and watched it",1228608000,,681,3.9705882352941178
2193776,4,B0006SSNW8,"There is no other PPV that entertains me as much as it seems to irritate everybody else.  I really enjoyed Puerto Rico's first WWE PPV, even though there are a lot of things wrong with it.  The naysayers' criticisms are very valid points, but for some odd reason, I just don't care.  I'm not sure I can explain why I enjoyed NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION 2005, but I'll take a crack at it:

The most obvious problems with NYR 2005 are easily the first three matches.  The opening Tag Titles Match actually moves along quite well for the most part.  It wasn't anything special, but it was an energizing crowd-pleaser.  Sadly, Eugene hurt his knee towards the end, which really put a damper on things.  The other three competitors (Christian, Tyson Tomko, and William Regal) deserve credit for improvising their way out of this problem, as does Eugene for still playing a small part for the rest of the match.

But then another injury plagues NYR 2005.  In a match that was anticipated almost as much as the Elimination Chamber main event, Lita was set to defend the Women's Title against Trish Stratus.  As the video package wonderfully hypes, these ladies were onto a great Divas rivalry.  However, within 3 minutes of the PPV contest, Lita busted her knee with a high-risk maneuver.  The opening tag team match gave us a good 15 minutes before things went sour, but fans and WWE staff were clearly concerned after this odd turn of events.  Keep in mind that I didn't feel ""jipped"", because Lita's knee was a legitimate problem, as opposed to a storyline angle.

Now where I disagree with other reviewers the most is the 3rd match.  Maven challenges Shelton Benjamin for the Intercontinental Title.  I hate to give spoilers, but I can't avoid it this time.  In short, Maven cuts a lengthy promo, and loses within a few seconds.  Afterwards, he rechallenges Benjamin to a rematch, and loses that almost as quickly.  Granted, I would've preferred a longer match between these two athletes, and don't understand why WWE booked this scenario.  However, Maven's trash-talking and heel antics were hilarious and sharp.  I dug Maven's procrastinating, and found his two swift defeats a funny payoff.

If you think I'm crazy by giving this PPV 4 stars, the next match isn't going to change your mind.  Muhammad Hassan (an Arab American heel, for those who never got to see him) made his PPV debut against Jerry Lawler.  This match is as good (or bad) as any other Lawler match in recent memory.  It doesn't help that Jim Ross is at ringside, leaving us with no commentary.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it usually doesn't work.  Overall, a mediocre performance from Lawler, with Hassan doing the best he can to make it all work.  On a side note, I loved the Hassan character, and believe he was wrongfully let go for political reasons.

Another reason I enjoyed NYR 2005 is grudge match between Gene Snitsky and Kane.  First off, I really enjoyed this rivalry, because Snitsky was such a crazed maniac who got a gigantic push out of nowhere --- he ""killed"" Lita's baby by mistake in his TV debut!  At the time, Snitsky and Kane had been battling for several months in stiff skirmishes.  For this PPV showdown, this is one of the better big-man faceoffs I've seen in recent years.  Both men are agile, strong, and tough.  This combination allows for a more back-and-forth contest than we usually see in these types of matches.  I've watched this one a couple times, and it still holds up.

Now, for the main event!  Just like everybody else has said, NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION 2005 is best remembered for the Elimination Chamber.  In my opinion --- and I dare say most other fans' & reviewers' --- this one is easily the best.  With respect to the Madison Square Garden original, this one is better in every way.  First off, the six competitors involved were RAW's absolute best talent at the time, and it shows.  The participants are Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Edge, Batista, Randy Orton, & Triple H...and the guest referee is Shawn Michaels!  If that roster doesn't get you excited, then you should skip the rest of my review and look for something else.  However, if you're still reading, then keep in mind that we get to see all kinds of performances: guest referee tension, lots of bloodshed, a downed cameraman, technical wrestling, a high-risk move from a Chamber pod, and even outside interference from Ric Flair.  Plus, there are no stupid moments, like in 2006 when Kurt Angle got eliminated first(!).  The whole piece moves for almost every second of the 40 minutes it lasts.  Oh, did I mention that the World Heavyweight Title was vacant?  History tells us who won the belt this night, but back in January 2005, it was anybody's guess.  In summary, this is an excellent match that makes the DVD worth buying.

2193777,2,B0006SSNW8,"NYR '05 was a pretty bad event to begin the year. Basically the only high note in this ppv is the World title Elimination Chamber match. That match was really the saving grace of this event. The Kane and Snitsky match was pretty good too.

1. World Tag Team Titles
Christian & Tomko vs. William Regal & Eugene
Me personally, I really do not like Eugene whatsoever but he really showed me some good stuff in this match. Regal and Christian had a couple of good offensive exchanges. Regal also gets bloody here. Eugene in a shocking way looked good in this match until his injury. Decent title match. 3.25/5

2. Women's Title
Lita vs. Trish Stratus
This match was defiantely a disappointment but only due to the ealry injury of Lita. Lita tryed her hardess to fight through the injury but it just didn't work out for her. Great toughness by Lita here but Trish wins. 1.25/5

3. Intercontinental Title
Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven
This defiantely could have been a great match but this too was a disappointment. This was totally a complete waste of time. Maven first stops the match to taunt the fans and benjamin for about 5 minutes then Benjamin gets the quick roll up on Maven. Maven demands a rematch and then Benjamin hits the t-bone to get the quick win once again. Just stupid, maybe Vince was scared of another injury? I don't know but this could have been on Raw. 0/5

4. Muhammad Hassan with Divari vs. Jerry ""the King"" Lawler with Jim Ross
This too could have been saved for Raw. The King was totally used as a jobber here to try and put over Hassan. King hardly gets in any offense until the end. The crowd was pretty much dead throughout the duration of the match. Hassan does take a sickening ddt by the King but this again could have been on Raw. 2/5

5. Kane vs. Snitsky
I really enjoyed this big man match. This was a great match to set up the main event. Some very hard shots were taken by both men and some good outside action takes place. Snitsky was able to pull off some good counters to Kane's offensive moves. Nice brawling was exchanged too with a couple of counters. The fans was very into this one and it did its job to get the fans ready for the main event. Very good match. 4/5

6. Elimination Chamber Match for the World Title w/ Shawn Michaels as the Special Guest Referee
Triple H vs. Chris Jericho vs. Batista vs. Edge vs. Chris Benoit vs. Randy Orton
This has to be in my eyes the best ECM so far. Everybody has a chance to show their stuff and it turned out great. It started out with a great wrestling match up between Benoit & Jericho. HBK & Edge was also continuing their rivalry here. Batista also was displaying his loyalty to Triple h & Evolution. Orton & Triple h had a pretty good match showing being the final two. A lot of awesome action was happening everywhere with a bunch of great spots. This was a FANTASTIC main event. This surely made up for the mid-card of this ppv. Awesome match, one of the bests of the year. 5/5

Like I said earlier this ppv was a bad way to open up the year but I say its worth a rental to check out the last 2 matches. But f you could find this somewhere for about 6, 5 bucks or under I recommend on getting this only to see the ECM.",1222473600,,3204,4.285950413223141

2193779,3,B0006SSNW8,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, this RAW-only PPV wasn't great at all! The Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Title saves the whole card. Let me explain:

William Regal/Eugene Vs. Christian/Tyson Tomko (World Tag Team Title Match) - While funny in spots, this match was pretty boring even with the scientifically sound William Regal and the talented Christian involved. Ends when Eugene rolls up Christian for a quick pin (which I think wasn't the original ending but they had to cut it short due to a legit injury to Eugene).

Lita Vs. Trish Stratus (WWE Women's Title Match) - Coming off a lost classic on RAW a few weeks prior, high expectations were given this Women's title match but unfortunately fell short due to an early injury to Lita's knee. Trish ended it shortly afterwards with a ""chick kick"" to the head for another women's championship.

Shelton Benjamin Vs. Maven (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - This wasn't really a match. It was more Maven stalling and talking for most of it. When they finally locked up, Benjamin quickly rolled him up for a fast pin! Maven then challenged him to a rematch right there and was pinned even faster than earlier with Benjamin's T-Bone (Exploder) suplex!

Muhammad Hassan Vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler - This stemmed from an attack on RAW on both Jerry Lawler and RAW commentator Jim Ross. Wasn't much of a match other than to get Hassan some heel heat. Hassan wins with a facebuster.

Kane Vs. Gene Snitsky - Wasn't much of a match but Kane did his best to carry ol' Gene to a decent performance. Ends when Kane dusts off his version of the tombstone piledriver.

HHH Vs. Batista Vs. Edge Vs. Randy Orton Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit (Elimination Chamber Match) - There have been 5 Elimination Chamber matches. I have seen three of them and this one is at least as good as the first if not better! Everyone gave it their all in this! It starts off with rivals and former partners Jericho and Benoit and it gets better from then on.

On a personal note as a fan, let me say that HHH should've lost! I respect ""The Game"" but he got his a** kicked in this one! ""The Canadian Chris'"" had him dead to rights after Chris Benoit not only hit him with a flying headbutt from the top of one of the chambers but then he and Jericho put their respective submission holds on him at same time! It should've been ""Game Over"" for HHH that night!

Anyway, spetacular match no matter who you rooted for.

Overall, this PPV wasn't great. In fact, it revolved around one match and that was The Elimination Chamber and the match itself lived up to the hype for the most part. I enjoyed HHH, Batista's, Orton's, Jericho's and Edge's efforts in this. After some soul searching (and the recent news), I could give even Chris Benoit his due with a clear conscious for this match as he had the move of the match (if not the night) without question!

1. Eugene and William Regal vs. Christian and Tyson Tomko(World Tag Team Championship)

This was an OK match to open the show. The crowd was really into this one, especially when Eugene came into the ring. Regal apparantly broke his nose and Eugene dislocated his kneecap when he landed from a dropkick. He was still able to roll up Tomko though. 6 out of 10.

2. Trish Stratus vs. Lita(Women's Championship)

This one could have been great, but another injury hurt this one. Lita went to do a Lou Thesz Press off of the apron but when she landed, I believe she hyperextended her knee. She courageously tried to fight back. Not a good match, but I'll add some points for Lita's toughness. 4 out of 10.

3. Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven(WWE Intercontinental Championship)

These two are exceptional athletes. I was looking forward to this match the most on the pay-per-view. Instead of a great match, I got two,yes two!, horrible matches. First, Maven complains for about 5 minutes about the fans heckling him. When he finally got in the ring, he lost within 5 seconds because of a rollup. Then, he asked for a rematch because that last match didn't count. After insulting Shelton, he lost within 5 seconds because of a T-Bone suplex. That's exactly what happened. 1 out of 10.

OH MY GOD! I thought that the IC title match was one of the worst matches I've ever seen. But this match takes the title of the worst match ever. This match made me consider committing suicide. It was incredibly boring, and no commentators meant that we had to hear Daivari speaking Arabian or whatever he speaks. 0 out 10.

5. Gene Snitsky vs. Kane

This match saved my life. If this match was anything like the previous 2, I would've went crazy and caused bodily harm to either myself or somebody else. But this match was pretty good. It wasn't really that slow, even though we had two big guys and there were some pretty good spots. Second best match of the night by far. 8 out of 10.

6. Elimination Chamber Match(World Heavyweight Championship)

Randy Orton vs. Edge vs. Triple H vs. Chris Jericho vs. Batista vs. Chris Benoit

This match was awesome. Every wrestling fan should see this match but I know that they won't because they won't buy the whole PPV for one match. But this match was just as good as the first Elimination Chamber match and better than the second. I haven't seen the fourth but I heard it sucked so this is probably better than that too. The match highlights are a diving headbutt off the top of the glass chamber, a powerbomb onto somebody on the mat and Jericho getting thrown onto the cameraman. 10 out of 10.

If you can get this for under $5.00, then get it. No one AND I MEAN NO ONE, should ever pay more than $5.00 for this.",1155600000,5,2889,4.509578544061303
2193784,3,B0006SSNW8,"I've never liked the idea of having an Elimination Chamber match at a brand only PPV. Elimination Chamber matches feature 6 of the best wrestlers from that particular brand. If they are all in the same match, this meansthat the rest of the card features midiocure matches that would normally occur once or twice a PPV. This especially frustrates me when talent is misused in the Chamber (e.g. Kurt Agle). This is why I think that Elimination Chamber matches should only occur at both-brand PPVs. This way, the other show can make up for this by having most of their matches fill up the card.
With all of that in mind, I think that New Years Revolution 2006 is an alright show.

Match 1- Intercontinental Championship- Ric Flair vs Edge
This match was never going to be a match of the year candidate. What it needed to do was give us an entertaining start to the show in whatever way possible. I think that they certainly did that. Flair's figure four on Lita was funny and the DQ ending was a nice touch to the match. I can see why some people didn't like this match, but I enjoyed it from beginning to end. 7/10

Match 2- Women's Championship- Trish Stratus vs Mickie James
This was a solid women's match with some nice holds and counter holds. It isn't as good as their WrestleMania bout, but it was still good. 7.5/10

Match 3- Jerry 'The King' Lawler vs Gregory Helms
This is one of those matches that would not have been on the card if there wasn't so uch talent in the Chamber match. Like Flair and Edge's match, this was never going to be a technical masterpiece. As long as it was somewhat entertaining, I would be happy. This match was better than I thought it would be. It was back and forth and went for a good ten minutes. I would have given it 6/10, but I thought that the ending was pretty weak. 5.5/10

Match 4- Big Show vs Triple H
This match really didappointed me. I thought that the broken hand stroyline was a good idea and would make this match more interesting. However, it only made this pretty boring match drag on for longer and longer. I can't believe that some people are giving this 8 or 9/10. This match is a total trainwreck until a cool sledgehammer shot. Even Triple H's Pedigeree is pretty weak. I was so happy when this one was over. 5/10

Match 5- Shelton Benjamin vs Viscera
This match is a total waste of Benjamin's exceptional talent. Viscera gives him nothing to work with and Mamma's screaming is just annoying. I also hated the ending. I guess it did lead to Benjamin turning heel. 4.5/10

Match 6- Bra and Panties Gauntlet Match- Maria vs Candice Michelle vs Torrie Wilson vs Victoria vs Ashley
This is one of those matches that you either love or you hate. I loved it! The girls look soooooooo hot and the wrestling is o.k.. Mae Young and Moolah's appearance is also quite commical. 7.5/10

Match 7- Elimination Chamber Match for WWE Championship- John Cena vs Shawn Michaels vs Carlito vs Kurt Angle vs Chris Masters vs Kane
This is a good main event. It is not as brutal as the other Elimination Chambers but it make up for it in other ways e.g. Carlito and Masters teaming up. Kurt Angle is one of my favourite wrestlers and this match is at its best when he is involved. So why was he the 1st eliminated? The same reason WWE kept Cena champ for 14 months (minus 3 weeks), because WWE are crazy! Anyway this is a good match, but it lacks the brutality that the other Chamber Matches had. It's a good match none the less. 8/10

Match 8- WWE Championship- John Cena vs Edge
I will rate this as a segmant rather than a match because the match consists of Edge beating up Cena and Spearing him. This one of my all time favourite moments. Edge cashes in his Money In The Bank briefcase and sperars Cena to become the NEEEEEW! WWE Champion. 10/10

Overall, New Years Revolution 2006 is an okay PPV considering the talent they had to work with. It is much better than last years New Years Revolution and the shocking endingwas a great way to end the first PPV of 2006.",1152489600,8,4007,4.404054054054054

Match #1: WWE Intercontinental Championship: Edge vs. Ric Flair (c)

This match wasn't too bad, but this is far, far away from being a classic. The ending was pretty nice, with Ric Flair bleeding for like the 104957th time. 5/10

Match #2: Women's Championship: Mickie James vs. Trish Stratus (c)

This was suprisingly good as both divas have in-ring wrestling experience. A good amount of counters brought this match to be watchable. It is rare to see Women's matches like these nowadays in WWE. Both have a good feud going on, and this match proved it. 7.5/10

Match #3: Gregory Helms vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

B-O-R-I-N-G, even though they tried to make some attempts to make this match even ""OK"". This was a waste of time, but it was nice to see Lawler wrestle again. 2/10

Match #4: Triple H vs. The Big Show

A good match, these two had a great storyline going on which led to this one. Big Show was injured in this one, and HHH took advantage of it (Show's hand). Both wrestlers just kept going back and forth. 7.5/10

Match #5: Shelton Benjamin vs. Viscera

WHY? Why did this match even come across the writing team? This was horrible, all boring. Only liked the backstage segment with Viscera and Shelton's momma. Shelton comes back from his long-losing streak in this one. 2/10

Match #6: Bra and Panties Guantlet Match: Maria vs. Candice Michelle vs. Torrie Wilson vs. Victoria vs. Ashley

Sucked. Mae Young and Moolah coming out made it even worse by making their presence. Two points for outfits and Torrie's suplex. 2/10

Match #7: WWE Championship: Elimination Chamber Match: Carlito vs. Kane vs. Chris Masters vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle vs. John Cena (c)

Didn't live up to expectations, but this was pretty good. Definitely the weakest out of the previous three (1st - Survivor Series 2002 [Rob Van Dam vs. Kane vs. Booker T vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho vs. Triple H (c)], 2nd - SummerSlam 2003 [Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton vs. Kevin Nash vs. Goldberg vs. Triple H (c)], 3rd - New Year's Revolution 2005 [Chris Benoit vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge vs. Chris Jericho vs. Batista vs. Triple H (Vacant World Heavyweight title - Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee). I do admire the WWE for trying to come up with new things like having unexpected situtations (Kurt Angle getting eliminated first, followed by Kane, and the roll-ups which were new as to win the match, but it was still bad). Overall, this was 28 minutes of decent wrestling. John Cena retains. 6/10

Yeah, most people are pissed right now. But wait...

Vince McMahon comes out, addresses that ""This individual is cashing in..."" which made the crowd go crazy. Edge comes out and gives McMahon his briefcase.

Match #8: WWE Championship: Edge vs. John Cena (c)

Short match, but another great storyline with it, along with the idea that most people didn't expect Edge to cash in his MITB. Two spears with pins in between leads to Edge finally winning the WWE Championship. 5/10

Good pay-per-view if you like surprises, but overall this was very disappointing. 39/80.

2193806,4,B0006SSNW8,"The 2006 NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION has a lot more going for it than it looks on paper.  Two Divas Matches?  Chris Masters and Carlito in a WWE Title Match?  Edge has Money-In-The-Bank, but is going for the Intercontinental Title?

Trust me, this one doesn't look very good.  But at the turn of 2005, I bought this PPV with confidence.  If you read on, I think you'll understand why...

1) Intercontinental Championship
Edge (""Mr. Money-In-The-Bank"" - w/ Lita) v. Ric Flair (champion)
---Okay, so this one isn't anything to go out of your way to see.  Basically, either Flair is getting beaten in boring fashion, or he's making Edge look foolish.  Don't get me wrong, it's kinda fun to see Flair take on the younger opponents, but sometimes, it's a little silly.  I guess I enjoyed it at its most basic level, but was hoping for more from these two guys.  At the very least, check out the finish...it's one of Edge's most iconic images.
""5.0 / 10""
______________________________________

2) Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (champion) v. Mickie James
---This is hands down the absolute best Divas rivalry I've ever seen.  The build-up was perfect, and the WWE could not have better developed this storyline.  Their future showdown at WRESTLEMANIA 22 is probably better remembered, but this encounter is still a ton of fun to watch.  Mickie James hadn't completely snapped at this point in time, making this one-on-one match more of a clean contest.  And what a contest it is!  Both ladies use a variety of holds, pinfalls, and counters that the women's division wasn't showing very often.  Even the Albany crowd was getting into the storytelling, which is rare for the WWE's Diva Matches.  Overall, this is an exceptional match, and I plead those who dislike women's wrestling to give this one a chance.
""7.5 / 10""
______________________________________

3) Jerry Lawler v. Gregory Helms
---Oddly enough, this is one of the most enjoyable matches from Lawler's recent catalog.  Because Helms is a smaller athlete, he sells The King's moves very well.  And Lawler was actually in fine form here, letting Helms show off his more creative offense.  The match slows down a little too much, but when the match is good, I think people will be surprised with how well Jerry Lawler can keep up with younger talent.  I think this is worth at least one viewing.
""6.0 / 10""
______________________________________

4) Triple H v. Big Show (World Tag Team champion)
---The angle behind this one was pretty intriguing.  ""The Game"" managed to get an advantage over Big Show by busting his arm with a sledgehammer; but Big Show's cast turned out to be an effective weapon.  So, the psychology between these two at this PPV was a unique spin on a typical injury angle.  And for the most part, the match flows quite well.  I mean, who doesn't love to see Big Show embarass opponents that are way smaller than he is?  I think just about everyone does.  Now, the important question is do you enjoy HHH when he gets into his ""Cerebral Assassin"" mode, where he picks a body part, and attacks it repeatedly?  I usually do, but I can understand if some viewers don't.  Overall, I like this match, and would've scored it a little higher if the finish weren't as sloppy as it was.
""6.5 / 10""
______________________________________

5) Shelton Benjamin v. Viscera
---This was an impromptu match that started because Viscera insulted ""Mamma Benjamin"".  If you don't know who this woman was, I think you missed out on a neat flash-in-a-pan.  Now, this match looks terrible on paper.  But to my complete surprise, it's actually pretty solid.  Shelton has always been a marvelous athlete, but I had no idea that his style would mesh well with Viscera's.  Viscera has never been a ""bad wrestler""; he just needs the right opponent.  Well, the two superstars put together a surprisingly back-and-forth contest, with Mamma Benjamin constantly trash-talking and coaching her son from ringside.  The finish is a tad weak, and the match isn't anything special.  But like most of the undercard, I think you'll be surprised at how watchable it is.
""6.5 / 10""
______________________________________

6) Bra-and-Panties Gauntlet
Maria v. Candice Michelle v. Torrie Wilson
v. Victoria v. Mae Young v. Ashley Masarro
---And the surprises just keep on coming!  Call me crazy, but this was one of my favorite matches of the PPV!  Now, aside from the obvious eye candy that WWE's female employees bring to the table, this one flowed very nicely.  There were very few botches, and these ladies actually came up with some neat ways to go for the clothes-stripping.  Also, keep in mind that most of these ladies were pretty poor wrestlers back in 2006.  Well, some of them still aren't very good, but on this night, they brought their A-game.  And Mae Young's surprise entrance was amusing; I still think her Miss Rumble 2000 stripping should be commended for its shock value.  I'll close with this: if you want a comparison, my favorite Bra-and-Panties Match is the one from Invasion (the July 2001 PPV).  This is a close second.  I can't believe I dedicated this much typing to this one!
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

7) Elimination Chamber Match - WWE Championship
Kane (World Tag Team champion) v. Carlito v. Chris Masters
v. Kurt Angle v. John Cena (champion) v. Shawn Michaels

---I think a little history is due for those who are new to this one:

*  Kane's a dominant wrestler, who hadn't held a major title in almost a decade.
*  Kurt Angle won his first WWE Title in Albany, and had been after the belt for months.
*  Shawn Michaels was given the most focus, because of his new rivalry with Vince McMahon.
*  Carlito and Chris Masters were fairly new to the WWE, but were getting majr pushes on RAW.  Plus, it was Masters 23rd birthday, and his MasterLock had yet to be broken.
*  John Cena had been the champ for almost a year, and he was getting booed more than any of us expected.  Also, I think this was before some of us fans were able to accept that Cena was a positive face for the WWE.

Alright, so now we've got this main event packed with trivia.  The match itself begins pretty well, with Cena and HBK doing some nice back-and-forth brawling.  Once Carlito enters the fray, the match starts getting into some hard-hitting Chamber spots, with Carlito taking some very unncessary chances.  Kane actually does his part better than usual; he's dominant to look legit, but professional enough to let other wrestlers double-team him.  Kurt Angle is a friggin' machine when het gets in the match, and was clearly Albany's favorite to win (mine too).  And I'll always believe Chris Masters to be WWE's most underused and underrated talent in recent memory.

This Elimination Chamber is a very good match, but rather than lots of high-risk action or blood, this one relies on surprises.  Kurt Angle is eliminated first for crying out loud!  Then Kane goes next!  Look at this lineup, and tell me those would've been your first two predictions to be pinned.  Even more shocking is how Shawn Michaels is the third to go!  Now, I've read that some people predicted that with Carlito/Masters/Cena being the final three, it was obvious who would win.  But honestly, I think that back in 2006 it was a crapshoot, and I still think that the match plays out just fine in its final moments.  Every wrestler gets to look like main event material, and I believed that all six were talented enough to look like serious contenders for the title......even John Cena (I hadn't warmed to him until 2007).
""7.5 / 10""
______________________________________

......But we still got one more surprise left.  After the Albany crowd and thousands of PPV buyers were disgusted that Cena was STILL our WWE champion, Vince McMahon brought us the good news: Edge was cashing in his Money-In-The-Bank!

If anyone ever tells you that they knew this was going to happen, you are to call them a ""LIAR!""  I seriously doubt anybody guessed that Edge was going to use his instant title shot at this very moment.  Edge deserved this title, and deserved more than 3 weeks to enjoy his reign (RAW's ratings increased heavily after this PPV).  Edge's post-match celebration is a little too long, but the shock still works.
""8.0 / 10"" (Not a match score, but just my overall reaction to the whole turn-of-events)
______________________________________

NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION 2006 is easily my favorite of the three PPVs with this name.  It lacks a must-see match that the 2005 and 2007 editions had (in my opinion).  But the card flows very nicely, and RAW's superstars delivered a much more entertaining package than brand-only events were expected to do.  2005 was an incredible year for RAW, and this PPV was a strong way to bookend it.

The fact that the Women's Title Match and Elimination Chamber Match are exclusive to this DVD should convince you to buy this one with confidence.  Thankfully, I believe NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION 2006 will be more rewarding than that.",1139875200,,9013,4.81877444589309

Cena and Michaels start it out, followed by Carlito, Angle, Masters and Kane

Angle is the greatest wrestler in the WWE period. Him being eliminated first was total garbage. He was in total control and an opportunistic Shawn Michaels nailed him with Sweet Chin Music while the crowd begged Cena to tap to the Ankle Lock. Carlito and Masters teamed up for the duration of the match, eliminating Kane and Michaels. Wile Masters had Cena in the Master Lock, Carlito betrayed him, picked up the pin and was promptly pinned by John Cena to retain the WWE title

Edge comes out and tears Cena apart, practically salivating the whole time, landing the spear and becoming the NEW WWE Champion

2193833,5,B0006SSNW8,"We all know that John Cena regained the belt at the Royal Rumble and the main problem with John Cena is that he is a MARKY MARK wannabe.  He can't rap. He can't wrestle.  He doesn't deserve to be the WWE champion and let's hope that Triple H will finally shut the mouth of John Cena when he destroys John Cena for the WWE championship at Wrestlemania 22 and gives a pedigree through the table. I was Cena fan in the beginning but Cena is nothing more than a transitional champion.  Cena will never ever measure up to Ric Flair, Sting, Hogan, Bret Hart, Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage.

Edge was smart when he defeated Cena for the WWE championship at the end of the PPV and Triple H proved once again why he is the Game when he defeated the Big Show.

After 8 painful months of John Cena as WWE champion, it was finally over and three weeks later, the WWE blundered when they had Cena regain the title.

On April 2, 2006, John Cena will be a former WWE champion- guaranteed!!",1138752000,,986,4.274193548387097

I can't stand it anymore. Do you people even watch the PPV. LEt me answer that, NO!!!. If you did, I wouldn't be seeing people give John Cena vs. Edge a 10/10, because wan't even a match. And another thing I have had with the crap you give John Cena. You think he is the worst, well he is not the best, but at least he entertaining, unlike another superstar I know, like Edge. Edge used to be entertaining, and he used to be good, but then he sneeks his way to get the title. Oh yeah thats cool, I mean hell that the best thing of all time, the way Edge won the title. You all think its like when Eddie or Chris Benoit won the world title, well let me tell you something, at least they put on a great match that deserved to be rated a 10/10. But you people don't care, you wanted to see John Cena lose, thats it, plain and simple,you people don't care how he lost it, it just great to see him loose it in the most discrceful imaginable. So I hope your all happy to see a coward as the champion, and maybe he will hold it till wrestlemania where he looses it to Triple H in the worst match to ever to be preformed at Wrestlemania. But it will still be the best because some slimeball will win it. So there you go people, I hope your all satified. I hope any of you have at least the decensity to actually watch a pay per view and then rate it. But I guess this was the best pay per view of all time just because a superstar who stills got a future in the buisness lost to a superstar who took 14 years of great entertainment and shoved it up his own ass.

A shot to from edge to flair with the money in the bank suitcase. Short but good. Winner-Ric Flair by DQ 8/10

2. Trish Stratus vs Mickie James- Can you feel a heel turn coming. I think it might it come from James but it should come from Trish. Trish seems more relaxed as heel. Anyway a good match by both women. Nice moves by Trish as usual and Mickie can wrestle very well(better than Ashley). Winner-Trish Stratus 8.5/10

3. Gregory Helms vs Jerry Lawler-One of the two dissapointments of the night. Nothing special here and nothing different then Lawler vs Hassan from last year. Winner- Jerry Lawler 3/10

4. Shelton Benjamin vs Viscera- A last minute match to waste time. Shelton Benjamin's ""mama"" was at times funny and at other times really annoying. Why are they making Shelton looking weak. He is a very talented athlete that deserves another push. There was nothing special here either. Boring stuff here. Winner Shelton Benjamin 3/10

5. Bra and Panties- Suprised that Maria actually lasted that long. Another boring match with a spot you don't want to see ever again. You'll know when you see the match. Winner Ashley 2/10

6. Elimination Chamber. I feel that there should've been a few more big spots in the match. The match could've went longer. Still with the time given impressive match. The unpredictability was crazy in this match. Wow never thought Cena and Carlito to be the last two. Winner John Cena 9/10

7. Edge vs John Cena- Hold on everyone the show is not over yet. Edge has cashed in his money in the bank briefcase and has made everyone thrilled. The crowd came alive when Edge won the title.

Outstanding match with a great ending. Again to me Cena losing the title is the best day in wrestling history. 10/10

Edge vs Ric Flair: Stiff, rough in places encounter that really goes nowhere due to events that occur later in the evening, your standard RAW match really, lousy DQ ending for Flair **

WWE Womens' Championship: Probably the best match next to the chamber, but falls short in some places, tells a great story without turning anyone, allowing things to progress to Wrestlemania, Trish and Mickie have a good solid wrestling match, Micky preventing herself from cheating in several places to try and maintain a respectable contest, honestly costs her the match ***1/2

Gregory Helms vs Jerry Lawler: Weak contest that serves to minimise the effect of Helms' new gimmick, Lawlers' lack of a piledriver finish also makes the match ending look weak *1/2

The Big Show vs Triple H: No point here, standard feud, sloppily paced, Show displays some new moves like a spear, Hunter does what he can with this, but beyond the story of Shows' cast being a handicap and a weapon at the same time.

WWE Championship: John Cena vs Chris Masters vs Carlito vs Shawn Micheals vs Kurt Angle vs Kane: The match of the night, and Carlitos' best match period, watch him execute a springboard swanton on Micheals, watch Kurts' ferocious onslaught upon entrance, bask in Masters getting cheered over Cena. And cringe when Angle is eliminated first, or when Cena won, whichever ****

WWE Championship: John Cena vs Edge, two speares, thats' it, DUD for the matchm ***** for any Cena hater out there looking for a breif fresh title change before ""Da Chump"" regains it at the Rumble, provided WWE bookers are that bloody stupid.

Scoring: 100-92% Classic, 91-85% Very Good, 84-79% Good, 78-70% Average, 69-63% Ok, 62-59% Not Good, 58-50% Very Bad, 49-0% Waste of Money.

Match #1:

Intercontinental Championship

Ric Flair vs. Edge

This match was very one sided, Ric Flair have only performed a couple of moves and Edge dominated Flair throughout the match. Ending was very unexpected, Ric Flair had put a figure-4-way leg lock on Lita and Edge attacked Flair with his briefcase. Flair was bloodied after the beating with the briefcase.

Winner: Edge

Score: 6/10

Match #2:

Womens Championship

Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James

I think this one was one of the best Women storyline they have come up with. And the match was just amazing, it was also one of the best Womens title matches ever. I enjoyed it alot, this was one of the nights best matches.

Winner: Trish Stratus

Score: 9/10

Match #3:

Gregory Helms vs. The King

They rushed this storyline way to fast to fill in the payperview a bit, but the match wasn't bad at all. It was pretty average wrestling match, and of course its nice to see The King in action at least once a year.

Winner: The King

Score: 7.5/10

Match #4:

Triple H vs. Big Show

WOW! This was an amazing match, Triple H is my favorite wrestler. And this match was the best of the night. Triple H could overcome Big Show cast, he ripped it off and kept working on Big Shows hand. Big Show was very hurt, he even broke the sledgehammer in half. HHH won by hitting Big Show with a sledgehammer and a pedigree. WOW!

Winner: Triple H

Score: 10/10

Match #5:

Shelton Benjamin vs. Viscera

It was very funny to watch Shelton and his mom arrive at the show. Throught the show they showed some funny segments which I liked and the match between these two guy was very entertaining! Sheltons mom made the match funny and hilarious to watch! Sheltons mom had hit Viscera twice with her handbag which contained a rock.

Winner: Shelton Benjamin

Score: 7/10

Match #6:

Divas Gauntlet

Well a nice dive bra and panties match is always nice to see! But then Mae Young came out and took of her clothes! It must be seen to believe what bra and panties she had on! I laughed so badly!

Elimination Chamber Match

WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Kane vs. Kurt Angle vs. Carlito vs. Chris Masters

Yup this was a dissapointing main event you can believe that playa. This is the worst Elimination Chamber match from the 4 that took place. It had only 1-2 good spots which were lame also. Carlito and Masters formed an alliance and eliminated most of the men from the chamber. The odd thing is that Angle got out first, that just pissed me off. And of course John Cena won... But keep reading and don't destroy your hopes!

Winner: John Cena

Score: 7/10

Match #8

WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Edge

Vince McMahon came out after the match and said that Edge wants to cash in his money in the bank and face John Cena right now. Well the arena was so excited it was crazy!!! Even I jumped up on my seat watching Edge come out and hoping he will beat John Cena! And IT HAPPENED! EDGE WON! It took him two spears to get the 1-2-3 count! The excitement was overwhelming! These 10 minutes saved the payperview from a complete disaster! It was so worth to see John Cena lose and Edge win! YOU MUST see this! Worth every single penny to see this!

Winner: Edge

Score: 10/10

Well thats the payperview. I can give some suggestion, if you have seen the previous chamber matches and your buying this dvd just to watch the chamber, don't to that. This chamber match was a big letdown, completely bad. But if you want to see John Cena lose then get this DVD! Youll be so happy to own this DVD! Trust me!

Well now its time to count up the score and announce what we have here!

2193860,5,B0006SSNW8,"Last night (Jan. 8th) I orded the New Year's Revolution which i believe is one of the best PPVs in over a year. It has everything that makes it good, matches, upsets, and even a twist at the end.

Match #1: Ric Flair vs. Edge w/Lita for the Intercontinental Championship - good match a little short and disappointing ending. Edge ends up hitting ric flair in the head with his Money In The Bank Briefcase and getting DisQualified. 4/10

Match #2: Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James for the Women's Championship - not a bad match, Mickie James really showed off her skills and her tuoughness in this match. Unfortunately, her love for tish and desire to be like trish costed her the match after missing the ""mick kick"" (as she called her version of the chick kick) and turning around to the original chick kick in the face. 6/10

Match #3: Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Gregory Helms - this match was not that good and, as could be predicted, not the most entertaining match. It is farely long for how long it should be. Jerry Lawler ends up hitting the fist drop off the turnbuckle to get the 1-2-3. 3/10

Match #4: Big Show vs. Triple H - this was one of the better matches off the night. Big Show came in with the advantage because off the cast on his right hand that was broken by triple h and his trusty sledgehammer. Triple H had to use a lot of his agility to escape and wear down the 7ft monster. Triple H ended up taking the cast off after shot to the ring post with the casted part of his right hand. Big Show then sprung forward to hit triple H off of him but accidentally knocking out the ref. This was the biggest mistake that big show could have made. Triple H immediately went after his side kick but when he brought it in the ring to hit big show, show snapped the sledgehammer in half with a crushing blow with his broken hand. Triple H resorted to bringing the big man out of the ring and placing his hand on the steel steps. He then grabbed a chair and swung for the fences at big shows swollen right hand. Triple H then took the big show back into the ring where he used the steel tipped part of the sledgehammer to strike the big show in the head. Show came to his knees where he least wanted to be. And as the ref came to all he saw was the game hit a pedigree on the big man and finished with the 3 count shoulders down. 8/10

Match #5: Shelton Benjamin w/His Momma vs. Viscera- this match was a lst minute time filler. it was caused when Ms. Benjamin was looking for some food and she bent over to look under a table and Viscera's music played as he walked up to observe her behind. Ms. Benjamin then went to the ring and told benjamin his losing streak was going to be broken against viscera. It was not a very long match but was ended when viscera got into the ""619"" position and Ms. Benjamin hit viscera in the head with her purse, which she later revealed was filled with bricks. Benjamin hit the dragon whip and knocked viscera down to break the curse of his losing streak. 5/10

Match #6: Bra & Panties Gauntlet Match: Maria, Candice Michelle, Torrie Wilson, Victoria, and Ashley - pretty good match if your a guy like me who loves looking at sexy women tearing each other's clothes off. maria tears off candice's clothes and then torrie's. Victoria soon comes in and derobes maria. Then a surprise which no one would ever like Mae Young and The Fabolous Moolah storm the ring. but mae doesn't need anyone to derobe her as she strips in the ring. she then tears off victoria's top. Ashley is last and comes in to take off victoria's bottoms. and for all of you who are disappointed because you don't get to see ashley in her bra & panties be disappointed no more as she strips for the crowd to show she cares about the fans and makes sure they get their money's worth. 6/10

Match #7: Elimination Chamber for the WWE Championship - John Cena {c} vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Carlito vs. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Masters vs. Kane - great match it could have been a hell of a lot better and was what i considered to be the worst and shortest elimination chmaber ever. it lasted about 25 minutes. Cena and michaels started out and was soon joined by carlito and then masters. Angle was the first eliminated after a superkick. Then Kane came. Kane was taken out in about 2 minutes. Then Michaels was taken out by a modified swinging neck breaker by carlito. Carlito and Masters worked together for a majority of the match but no allies stay allies for long in WWE. Carlito rolled up Masters in a school boy while he had Cena in the masterlock. then cena rolled up carlito for the 1,2,3. 7/10

Match #8 - Edge vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship- Best match personally because i do not like cena and edge is my favorite wrestler. Mr. McMahon came out as soon as Cena got the victory and congradulated him on his victory and then informed him that there was one more match. He then said that a certain superstar decided to use his Money In The Bank Contract now. Edge then came out and immediately delivered a spear. 1,2, kickout. Cena had kicked out of the spear after a completely hellacious beat down in the elimination chamber. Edge then went back to the corner. Bam! another Vicious Spear! 1! 2! 3! finally a new champion that everyone can be proud of. although he may have taken the cheap way out he did what it took to claim his first WWE championship. 10/10 if you're an edge fan

or 3/10 if you go by decensy of match.

Overall this PPV got 59/80 which means its about 87 out of 100. pretty good i definately recommend this PPV to anyone who wants to purchase it on DVD on Feb. 7th or wants to by the encore version on IDPPV. Good night everyone and hope you enjoyed the review.",1136764800,,5697,4.3010251630941285

These two could have done better and this match was too short. Flair retains by DQ.I'm giving it a seven because of the figure 4 lock on lita. 7/10

Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James

A typical, boring women's match. Trish retains. 4/10

Jerry ""the King"" Lawler vs. Hlems

A filler match which ended with an elbow from King for the win. 5/10

Big Show vs. Triple h

I found this match horrible and it was too slow which made it kind of boring. It was mainly because of Big Show's injured hand. The pedigree by HHH wasn't that good. In 2000 he had given Big Show much better pedigrees. HHH wins, but i'll give this a 6 because of the part where Show broke the sledgehammer. 6/10

The aftermath of this match made this ppv worth my money.

Orders of elimination are:

1. Angle 2. Kane 3. HBK 4. Masters 5. Carlito

I was disappointed by the way HBK and kane were eliminated. Angle should not have lost so soon. More than half of the crows booed Cena and chanted ""Cena sucks"" the whole time. I think this gave vince the idea to cheer up the Cena haters which were like I said, more than half of the crowd. Cena losing the title just made my day.

Elimation Chamber- Benoit vs. Jericho vs. Edge vs. HHH vs. Randy Orton vs. Batista- Great Main Event. Better then the SummerSlam Chamber but not as good as the Survivor Series Chamber.

That stupied Randy Orton lost, I'm glad he did, I hate him. I liked it when HBK screwed Edge with the super kick, then Jericho hits the lionsault on edge to elimate him.

 Trish Stratus vs Lita for title. Lita came in the match as the champ. Very good match. Lita was controlling through the match, then she dove out of the ring  onto Trish, hurt her knee, witch Trish would win to be champ!

 Shelton Benjamin vs Maven, for IC Title. Fans boooing Maven, hmm I wonder why?!? Shelti picked a quick win, Maven demanded a rematch, Shelti won again. Very quick, but unusually entertaining. When I met Shelti, he said that was his easiest match.

 Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs Hassan w Davairi. Very pointless. At least JR was at ringside. I, and a lot of fans, were rooting for King. He just couldn't win that night:(

 Kane vs Snitsky, in a grudge match, it was good. Fast moving, with two huge scary men. Kane picked up  the 1-2-3

 Elimination Chamber: Spaecial Ref is HBK- Y2J vs Benoit vs Edge vs Batista vs RKO vs Triple H. Very exciting. Edge went out 1st, then Benoit, then Y2J, then Batista, then Orton, and HHH won. Suspensful near the end. RKO got HHH good, getting the pin, but Batista's cage was having trouble opening, he was full of rage. Got it open and it was a 2- on 1 brutal finish. Randy was SO close, having lost it could ruin someone.
 Just think about this: If Batista's chamber didn't open for a few more seconds, (if the ref was having more problems opening it) imagined what the WWE would be like. If Randy Orton won the World Heavyweight Championship that night, what would the company be like? What could have happened to WM21? We will never know, but just think about it!

The extras include post match interviews of the Elimination contestants, and promos. The DIVA's also are seen poolside, and engage in a chicken fight. Don't miss out on New Years Revolution.",1130371200,,1884,4.454810495626822
2193886,3,B0006SSNW8,"WWE New Year's Revolution Opener:

The pay-per-view opened with a video package looking at the island of Puerto Rico, but things changed quickly as the Elimination Chamber is coming to time, and the heavenly Puerto Rico is going to be hell on earth! The fireworks then went off in the arena for the start of the show as Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler welcomed us to San Juan!

1st match: Eugene and William Regal (c) vs. Tyson Tomko and Christian for the World Tag Team Championship:

The Finish:

Regal tried to fight to his corner but Christian snuck up behind Eugene and pulled him off the apron. Regal made it to the corner but Eugene was not there. Eugene then tried to come inside, but Christian and Tomko double teamed Regal with the referee's back turned. Regal and Tyson collided in the middle of the ring and Regal crawled to the wrong corner. Tyson splashed Regal in the corner and then dropped a knee into the face of Regal. Tyson with a charge in the corner, but Regal moved and made the tag. Eugene went to work with right hands on Tyson, and then a big clothesline. Eugene caught Christian off the top and have Tyson a dropkick. Eugene looks to have hurt his left knee and this looks legit as both Christian and Tyson looked lost. Christian and Tomko sent Regal outside, and then Eugene rolled Tyson up from behind for the win, but he is badly hurt.  A decent enough way to kick off the New Year.

Winners via Pinfall: Eugene and William Regal

Rating: 5/10

Earlier in the Day:

Christy Hemme was shown at poolside earlier in the day. Fun.

Backstage:

Tyson and Christian were shown backstage and they came across Edge. Edge asked Christian how he was feeling. Edge said he had an idea and it involves him, and he can trust him. Christian told Tyson to kick Edge's ass but Edge said if Christian doesn't want to be World Champion, then fine. Christian decided to listen and the three walked off.

2nd match: Lita (c) vs. Trish Stratus for the Women's Championship:

Trish with a kick to the gut and some forearm shots but Lita sent Trish to the outside. Lita followed out and hit a Thesz Press off the apron and Lita may have blown her knee as well! Trish sent Lita back inside and scored a two. Trish with a right hand and then some mounted punches on the canvas. Trish worked over the other knee in the corner and Lita is hurt for real. Trish stomped on Lita's knee in the corner as we are shown another replay, and things don't look good for Lita. Lita went for her DDT, but Trish threw her off. Trish scored with the Chick Kick and made the quick cover, and this one is over already!  A piece of crap match.

Winner via pinfall: Trish Stratus

Rating: 2/10

The Aftermath:

The referee's and trainer helped Lita to the back, and this is not a good start as we have had two injuries in two matches!

Backstage:

Chris Jericho was shown backstage and he is ready for his shot at the World Championship tonight!

Earlier in the Day:

Maria was shown relaxing in a bikini at the pool earlier in the day.

Backstage:

Edge was shown with Eric Bischoff and Eric said that Edge wants to be taken out of the Elimination Chamber. Edge said he wants the title, but HBK is the referee and he won't let it happen! Why should Edge go through that! Edge said Christian will take his spot in the Chamber, and then the winner will face Edge tomorrow night on RAW! Eric said the show has already started and he has sponsors and advertisers. Edge said he doesn't care, all he cares about is him! Eric said there is no way he is making any changes for the match tonight, and he should deal with it. Edge screamed that it wasn't fair and left. He then walked into HBK and Michaels said he has two responsibilities, count the pinfall and call for the submission. Shawn said he will call it down the middle but if anyone puts their hands on him, he will retaliate physically. Michaels said if the opportunity arises, he will enjoy counting Edge's shoulders to the mat. Uno, Dos, Tres!

3rd match: Shelton Benjamin (c) vs. Maven for the Intercontinental Championship:

Benjamin then walked around the ring and Maven said he is out of here, and he will take on Shelton in the USA. Maven started to walk up the aisle but stopped half way and ran into the ring. Maven went for a right on Shelton, and Shelton rolled him up for the win!

Winner: Shelton Benjamin

Maven screamed for the music to be cut and he told Shelton to get back here, and that did not count. He said he wants a rematch right now! He said that there is one Woman's Champion, but it appears now that they have two. Benjamin walked back to the ring with a look of anger. Maven said Benjamin and Trish have one thing in common, they have no balls! Benjamin charged to the ring and hit the T Bone and made the cover and he has beat Maven AGAIN!  Hilarious stuff but I wish we could have seen a match.

Winner: Shelton Benjamin

Earlier in the Day:

Candace was shown putting sun tan lotion on Christy near the pool.

Backstage:

Chris Benoit was shown backstage doing push ups, and he is getting ready for the Elimination Chamber. Jim said that King has gone to get ready for his match and he will be in his corner tonight.

Backstage:

Todd Grisham was backstage with Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. Hassan said the footage from last week is typical of the American Media, and it was biased. It only showed the physicality but not JR and King calling them jackasses and telling them to leave their country. He said JR and King got what they deserved. Todd asked if he was nervous. Daivari said Hassan is not nervous. Hassan said he was excited. He said that Puerto Rico isn't even good enough to be called a state, and the people of this island are second class citizens, so they must feel what Hassan and Daivari go through. Last night flying in, they were detained at the airport for three hours. Khosrow had his wallet stolen in a restaurant. Muhammad said Lawler will be used as an example for what people will except from them. Khosrow said something in Arabic and they made their way to the ring.

4th match: Jerry The King Lawler vs. Muhammad Hassan:

The Finish:

Hassan locked in a Million Dollar Dream on King but Lawler fought out. Lawler was knocked down with a knee to the gut for two. Hassan sent Lawler to the buckle and gave him some right hands. King started to get fired up and the blows had no effect. Lawler unloaded with some big rights of his own to knock Hassan down and then scored with a dropkick. Lawler went to the middle rope and hit the fist drop for two. Lawler hit a sick DDT on Hassan and made the cover but Daivari put Hassan's foot on the rope. Lawler went out and chased Daivari around the ruing and Daivari went right into JR. Daivari got inside and Lawler grabbed him but he escaped. Hassan then hit an STO for the win.  Why is Jerrly Lawler wrestling!?

Winner via Pinfall: Muhammad Hassan

Rating: 4/10

Backstage:

Todd was backstage with Batista and he asked him his chances. Batista said his chances are great, but the Orton came in. Orton asked Batista if he is going to go after the title, or is he going to be Triple H's stooge? Orton said Triple H doesn't give a damn about him. All he cares about is the World Title and that is why he created Evolution in the first place. Orton said he is going to put him on the spot. Is he going to kick his ass or is he going to kiss it? Batista said if he sees a shot to become champion, he is taking it!

In the arena:

The music of the Coach hit in the arena and he made his way to the announce table, and he will be joining JR for commentary.

5th match: Gene Snitsky vs. Kane:

The Finish:

Snitsky grabbed a chair and went to hit Kane, but Kane hit a boot to the face. Kane sent Snitsky back inside but Snitsky hit a kick to the gut. Kane came back and sent Snitsky to the corner and unloaded with right hands and reverse elbows. Kane sent Snitsky to the corner and charged in with a clothesline. He then hit a side walk slam and a big boot to the face. Kane went up top and came off with a flying clothesline. Snitsky fought back with knee's to the gut and then hot shotted Kane on the ropes. Snitsky with a big clothesline on Kane and both men are down. Kane scored with a big uppercut on Kane and then grabbed him by the throat, but Snitsky then grabbed Kane by the throat. Kane fought Snitsky's hand off and then Snitsky started to bit Kane's ear! Kane then signalled for the end and hit the Tombstone for the win!  This event just gets worse!

Winner via Pinfall: Kane

Rating: 4/10

Earlier in the Day:

We go poolside and Stacy is shown. Maria is then shown undressing and Candace is shown putting lotion on Christy. Simon Dean is then shown drinking out of a pineapple. He comes across some fat guy, and pushes him into the pool. Stacy is shown playing with Val Venis in the water. He picks her up on his shoulders and they are going to have a Chicken Fight. Rosey and Hurricane are there as well as Rob Conway. Christy and Maria were the final two and Christy undid Maria's bikini and then pushed her over for the win. Lawler has joined both Coach and JR on commentary for those keeping score.

Main Event: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Batista vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge in an Elimination Chamber Match for the World Heavyweight Championship:

Triple H is a bloody mess as Batista takes over on Orton with right hands. Orton fought back with right hands on both men and went for the RKO on the Game but Triple H shoved him off into Batista. Batista went for the Batista Bomb but Orton hit the RKO and made the cover and Triple H didn't save Batista! Triple H sent Orton to the steel but Orton took over, sending the Game into the chains and then back into the ring. Orton called for the RKO and scored with it in the middle of the ring but Batista and Flair had HBK distracted and Batista hit Orton with a clothesline. HBK took Flair down and stomped on him and Orton and H are both down! Triple H then went for the Pedigree on Orton and Orton is knocked out. Triple H then hit the Pedigree and made the cover and the Game has won the World Title!  A very bloody and great match!

Winner via pinfall: Triple H

Rating: 9/10

The Aftermath:

Flair and Batista got back inside the ring and celebrated with Triple H. Batista hugged the Game and then Batista hoisted Triple H on his shoulders and they celebrated with Triple H. Batista again hugged the Game and Evolution are on top once again as the show went off the air!

Match Rating- 4/10

Simply this is one of the best matches I've ever seen. I wish they would've let Orton have the title even if just til the Rumble. But this match was a classic from start to finish. All of these guys deserve to be main eventers. Unforgettable match.

Match Rating- 9/10

This PPV was a little bit dissapointing because I was expecting the women's championship match to be a classic and for someone besides Triple H to win the title.

Elimination Chamber for the Vacant World Heavyweight Championship

Triple HHH vs Randy Orton vs Batista vs Chris Jericho vs Edge vs Chris Benoit 10/10- awesome!! a definite early candidate for 2005 match of the year. the 2nd best of the 3 chamber matches. this was 35 minutes of pure excitement. a must see for any true wrestling fan.

overall, one of Raw's worst PPV's, but the elimination chamber is what saves this from being the worst ppv ever. it is not as bad as some make it out to be. Raw put all its eggs into one basket(elimination chamber) for this event.",1116115200,,1868,4.704615384615384
2193894,2,B0006SSNW8,"I've been a WWE/F fan since 1988, and I'd have to say that out of all the ppv's they've ever had, New Year's Revolution was the worst. Now for starters, when a wrestling fan thinks of January, they think of the Royal Rumble. Why have another ppv in the same month? I understand the whole ""finding a winner for the vacant belt"" thing, but it would have been more effective to do that at the Rumble. Imagine having the elimanation chamber match at the Rumble with HHH winning, and then Batista goes on to win it the same night? That would have been excellent. The only reason I gave this a 2 was for the main event, and for the hot puerto rican crowd. They were on fire pretty much all night, even though they got a waste of a ppv. On to the matches.....1)Eugene/Regal(WWE Raw tag champs) vs Christian/TomkoFirst off, any match with Tyson Tomko is brutal to watch. But the other 3 helped the match. Eugene going down with a legit knee injury was ashame to see. I know others complained about the finish of the match, but I didn't have a problem with it. 2/52)Lita(Women's champ) vs TrishThe wwe must have made a split second decision here because Lita had just won the title like a week before. After she hurt her knee, they must have told the ref in his earpiece to change the outcome to Trish winning, because Lita wasn't expected to drop it that fast. 1/53) Shelton Benjiman vs MavenThis bothered me a lot at first at all the stalling by Maven. But it ended out playing pretty good. Maven was getting the crowd very worked up, and this whole ""stalling"" thing was probably added at the last minute due to the previous two matches ending so quickly. Shelton gets the win, but not like you'd expect. 1/54)Jerry Lawler vs Hassan. Very predictable, and pointless. I like Lawler, but this match should have just happened on Raw. 1/55)Gene Snitsky vs KaneGood match for big men, but I hate Snitsky, so it was hard to watch. 2/56)Elimination Chamber match Jericho vs Benoit vs Orton vs HHH vs Batista vs EdgeBest match of night of course. Crowd was bananas the whole match. They loved Batista and basically Evolution as a whole. All of the eliminations were cool and Benoit hit a flying headbutt from the top of the cage!

WILLIAM REGAL & EUGENE defeated CHRISTIAN & TYSON TOMKO to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: Decent tag match to open up with. Nothing too bad at all, but a little too much going through the motions for my liking. Christian & Tomko teamed well & look as though they may have long-term potential as a team. More than sufficient 12 minute bout, although the ending was obviously disappointing. Knee injury or no knee injury, a cheap roll-up finish where Tomko seemed to get a shoulder up before the 3 count was a bad way to end. Finally, this may sound horrible, but I can't believe that Eugene injured himself on what looked to be a simple dropkick. Match Rating...6

TRISH STRATUS defeated LITA to Win the Women's Title: Short 4 minute match which probably was shortened due to Lita's knee injury, sustained while attempting a Lou Thesz press from the apron to the outside. Started off with the proper intensity that the feud deserved, but following the injury, Trish dominated & nothing special happened at all. Match Rating...3

SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated MAVEN to Retain the InterContinental Title: Well here was some interesting booking: The first 5 minutes was Maven effectively getting heat from the hot Puerto Rico crowd. Then after Maven threatened to walk out, he immediately got rolled up for the pinfall. Maven then successfully got even more heel heat by talking Benjamin into coming back for a rematch. Believe it or not, I had no problems with the booking at this point in time. Then again, I thought I was going to be treated to a 10 minute bout after all the shenanigans. A t-bone slam later & I'm left wondering who thinks this is the way an improving wrestler (Maven) should be pushed. Match Rating...2

MUHAMMAD HASSAN defeated JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER: Ten minutes of relatively basic & predictable action. Why the WWE didn't allow Coach to commentate during this bout is beyond me, as the match definitely lost something due to the lack of announcing. Hard to tell how good Hassan is in the ring, as the match was so methodically paced & utilized only basic holds. The bout probably deserves a ranking of 4, but I'm going to add 1 point for the old-school heel managing of Daivari on the outside. Match Rating...5

KANE defeated GENE SNITSKY: Inconsistent 12 minute bout which was pretty good for a non-gimmick big man match. More than sufficient intensity & action which was initially well booked. However, 12 minutes was obviously a little too long for a rusty Kane & a rookie who obviously must work on his fitness/stamina. The last few minutes got very sloppy & both men (but especially Snitsky) looked like they were struggling to move come the finish. Match Rating...6

TRIPLE H defeated RANDY ORTON, BATISTA, CHRIS JERICHO, CHRIS BENOIT & EDGE in an Elimination Chamber match to Win the World HeavyWeight Title: Quality main event which sufficiently delivered on all levels. Excellent intensity was added to by some very good byplay between the combatants both before, during & after the match. We started off with Benoit & Jericho, and they very much delivered with numerous crisp exchanges. The great thing about this match was that pretty much everyone comes out of it looking strong, one way or another. Being critical, there were far too many 1 on 1 contests when there were more than 3 men in the ring, while I also thought it got down to the final 3 a little too early. From there, I actually predicted the booking perfectly & therefore compliment the WWE on the final few minutes of this terrific 35 minute match. Triple H even added the 'Wedgigree' to his repertoire to finish off Orton. Even after the bout, the booking was great, as the WWE used the hoisting up on Batista's shoulders/thumbs up routine to hint at a Batista face turn. A job well done by all. Match Rating...9

PPV RATING (31/60) = 52

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'New Year's Revolution' a 'D' grade & said that it was 'mediocre & disappointing'. I think that pretty much sums it up without me having to elaborate any further. The main event most definitely delivered, but nothing else on the card exceeded my moderate expectations. It really was not all that much to ask for either. While the 2 injuries at the beginning didn't help matters, the type of booking used for the Banjamin vs Maven match pretty much sums up what the WWE thought of this card; A one match show. They have to get out of that mentality to keep casual fans for the long-term.",1114732800,2,5037,4.675706214689265
2193897,4,B0006SSNW8,"There were only six or seven matches on this Pay Per View and only a few of them were good. Out of this PPV and Royal Rumble 2005, I like Royal Rumble Better. Here are the matches and the results.

WWE Raw presents New Year's Revolution

January 9, 2005

Coliseo De Puerto Rico

San Juan, Puerto Rico

1) William Regal and Eugene vs. Chrisitan and Tyson Tomko

World Tag Team Championships

This match was not bad and it was kinda slow. The match was shocking when Eugene injured his leg and even though won the match. Eugene was rushed to the hospital after that and had a twisted ankle or knee (not sure). 7/10

2) Lita vs. Trish Stratus

Women's Championship

This match was not that good because it was short and Trish won the match. Near the beginning of the match, Lita messes up her ankle and that pretty much makes Trish the champion. Anyways, Trish wins the title and will probably keep it for a long time. 5/10

3) Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven

Intercontinental Championship

This match was short and Maven wasted a lot of time in the match. Shelton Benjamin wins the match twice once by a rolling pinfall and second by a T-Bone Suplex. Although, it was pretty funny seeing Maven get beat in less than 30 seconds in the second match. 6/10

4) Muhammad Hassan vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

This match sucks and really doesn't deserve a rating because of Muhammad Hassan. And the worst part about the match was that Muhammad Hassan won the match. 2/10

5) Kane vs. Gene Snitsky

This was one of the best matches and a great grudge between the two wrestlers. Kane wins the match and Gene is left on the ground. 10/10

6)Elimination Chamber

Triple H vs. Chris Benoit vs. Randy Orton vs. Batista vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge

World Heavyweight Championship

This was probably the best match on the card. There was a lot of blood and action. I also thought that Chris Benoit jumping off the top of the chamber was pretty sweet. Although, Triple H wins so that takes off one mark. Batista was an animal. 10/10

Overall, this Pay Per View gets 40/70 which equals to 57%. This Pay Per View was worth buying I guess. Or not buying, then renting.",1113782400,2,2141,4.463917525773196
2193898,2,B0006SSNW8,"Elimination Chamber was great, but of course, the predictable ending. Lita vs Trish and the Tag Title matches ended up very sucky but it wasn't their fault. What happened was that some unexpected (real life) injuries came into play early on in these matches. The superstars tried their best to keep things going, however, you still knew that Lita and Eugene were going to be gone from in ring competition for a long time and so you couldn't help but feel really bummed out for the rest of the event.",1113609600,,499,4.555555555555555

 this would of been a great match but Maven had to be a bitch, but entertainng moments, bue still..... *1/2

3)Lita vs Trish  Women's Title

 wat the hell is this, Lita wins the title, finally, and gets injured again and loses it, to Trish, this wasn't even a match, she got injured like 2 min after the bell rang *1/2

2193909,2,B0006SSNW8,"1) Christion, Tyson Tomko vs Eugene, William Wregle. this match was not right for a ppv. i think the match would be an average Raw match. there was nothing exciting happening just an ordinary boring slow tag match. i have seen over 50 ppv openers better than that. 6/10

2) Womens title. Trish vs Lita. YIKES!!!! this was terrible. Lita did only one moves and she hurt her knee and could not participate  in the match. it was the crappiest cross body i have ever seen and she hurt herself doing it. trish pick up the win. around 2 minutes. 2/10

3) Intercontinental title. Shelton Benjamin vs Maven. to tell you the truth i was really looking forward to seeing Maven wrestle. he has never had this opportunity before and i thought he would be able to put on a good match. but instead he show boated for the crowd and easily got pinned twice. 1.5/10

4) Jerry Lawer vs Muhamed Hassan. this match was slow and boring. there was no commentary except Daivairi and JR yelling and screaming like little girls on the outside. Hassan basically dominated the match and got the pin. the only thing good about the match is the way Hassan took the ddt. it looked amazing. 3/10

5) Kane vs Gene Snitsky. i thought that when Kane came back he was going to be all fired up with anger and would want to kill Gene Snitsky but instead he acted like he would a normal match. the match was really good. it was a basic match. nothing really special btu it was still enetertaing. 8/10

6) Elimination Chamber match. Triple h vs Randy Orton vs Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit vs Edge vs Batista. to tell you the truth i thought that this elimination chamber match was better than the one at summerslam and the one at survivor series because the elimination were not quick, there were moves on the steel and because the match was alot more fast paced. the only reason to buy the DVD would be because of this match. 10/10

Overall this DVD was a complete failure. there were four match that were terrible, one that was good and one that was amazing. also on the back of the cover it says there are bonus matches but the isint any bonus in the extras. there is no sunday night heat match. there is just promo's and interviews. the final rating of this DVD would be 5/10

Match #1 Scott steiner vs jeff hardy, in a TLC hardcore match for the hardcore title!

This match starts off with steiner giving jeff multiple suplexes off the ladders through sheets of glass and razor wire and by the 8th or 9th suplex jeffs back is covered in his own blood. After this jeff gets up and climbs the ladder in the ring and steiner slides outside the ring and taunts jeff so jeff doing the xtreme thing dives outside the ring over the top rope off  the ladder with a corkscrew 630 nailing steiner right in the mouth breaking his jaw and all you can hear is a loud snap. After this a bump happens that changed the wrestling world for ever and not to spoil it but it is like the mick foley fall off the hell in the cell but not so lazy like micks and 10'000 times worst!. After this all goes down the great fans in Canada are giving these two guys the ovation they deserve buy applauding every move and hanging from the rafters, and right when you think it's over the fun just begins cause the lights flick off for one second and when they come back on jeff hardy is on top of the scaffolding and steiner is climbing it too and when he gets up jeff gives him a pedigree 85 feet in the air and the doctors rush out to make the save. This match ends in a draw cause both man could have been killed and cant walk due to broken backs and cracked open skulls but at least they got a standing ovation right? This match gets 1000000000000000000/10 it's the best thing ever what ever you do don't listen to anyone else they just hate jeff hardy but how can you after this blood bath!

Match #2 ""the flash"" kevin nash vs low ki in a kick boxing death match for the right to be called mr. Indy (they are feuding from a past Ring of honer show and nash stole there belt)

This one goes into triple over time both men are great in this kind of invirment but this night goes to mr. Indy kevin nash. If you love pro kick boxing this will make that look like a 4th grade playground scuffle. Cause this crap ain't pretty nash gets like 17 shots right to his temple while he's being handcuffed to a pole and his ears are gushing blood and his head is turning black and blue from the swelling. Finally the ref gets nash out of cuffs and he starts throwing kicks to low ki's mid section then to his face taking the athlete down to his knees. Now I'm not going to spoil this instant classic but ill tell you it ends with a kick combo herad around the world with a grand total of 65 shoots to nashes skull and nash coming back with his famous knife O' matic (a tornado kick combo) that gets him the win. 100000000/10 god I love cruiser weights!

Match#3 hulk hogan vs hardcore holly in a best 2 out of 3 falls match! The first fall is death match, Second fall is barbed wire cage match and the third is a ""hulkamania scaffold match for the united states title!

Wow im not even going to bother trying to review this match cause nothing I can say can do as much justice as the fight itself, this bad boy was a rocket buster it's a freaking classic man! God I love this match I just watched it three time today and I saw the ending six times cause I couldn't believe hogan gets Alabama slammed off the scaffolding 80 feet to the bare floor and you hear a splat!

This match goes about 45 minutes and not one boring or sloppy move takes place in that time but there is some double shooting stars, 450's, top of scaffolding Pepsi plunge's, plus lots of glass, barbed wire, fire, and cheese graders in hogan's case, plus some cool chants from these blood thirsty fans! 50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 god thank you hogan for all the memories, and yes hulkamania will live for ever after this one!!!!!

Match#4 Paul London vs some jobber, I think they called him CM punk or CM dunk I cant remember cause I got this DVD for the wrestling portion of it. -1000000000000000/10 god Vince why waist valuable tv time with this crap, not one thing cool happed on it. At least hogan knows what selling a move is ment to look like.

Match#5 Goldberg vs the team of Shannon more, Akio, funaki, tajiri, and nunzio, in a triple cage match! God this is the best match ever if you like seeing people get hurt and in this case paralyzed then this is for you I cant spoil the ending but I will say it ends with a thrust kick from Goldberg on all his opponents from the top of cage three and all his victims fly off in orderly fashion! And missing the stack of tables set up down there cause Goldberg kicked them so hard the flew onto pure concrete! 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 god I love you bill Goldberg you are my hero, thank you so much for this piece of art .

2193911,4,B0006SSNW8,"The 2004 year only had 1 or 2 good PPV's but this is a nice start to 2005. But of course improving PPV's isn't without injuries especially in wrestling. Eugene and Lita got injured in the first two matches. While i still don't know how Eugene got injured, Lita had replays of hers with her jumping off the apron of the ring, that looked so painful. But hats off to Lita and Eugene, giving it their all. With two injuries early, i wonder what Vince Mcmahon was thinking after that, when he knew the Elimination Chamber was still to come. Of course Kane and Snitsky was a bore, mainly due to its late number in the card, two big guys who move slow are most likely going to have a slow match. The Elimination Chamber, if i were to compare this to the first two, i would rate it last, because it's not as violent as the first two but it is still a great match. Benoit doing the diving from the corner was good. Triple H took more shots to the back then anyone in the match. And no camera man is safe in any sport, probably the most most painful site in the match was when Batista press slammed Jericho into the camera man, i felt so bad for the camera man. Overall, a big improvement over a lot of the PPV's of 2004, The Royal Rumble would also be good aswell.",1111708800,3,1256,4.151639344262295

New Year's Revolution

My card:

Christian vs. Rhyno

 Back and forth match.  Who would have guessed this would be a great match.  It was giving time to develop and it did develop.  Christian goes for the Unprettier but Rhyno reverses into the Gore.  Then Tomko comes down and boots Rhyno and Christian covers Rhyno.

Winner: Christian 7 out of 10

La Resistance vs. Mystery Opponents (The Dream Team) (Shawn Michaels & Randy Orton) for the World Tag Titles.

 When the Dream Team comes out the crowd goes crazy.  La Resistance tries to run but HBK hits Sweet Chin Music then Angle comes out and beats Shawn up and pushes Randy into an Au' Revoir for the 3.  Very quick match.

Winners: La Resistance 5 out of 10

Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair.

 Y2J comes out all happy until Flair comes down with a man in a mask.  The man gets in the ring and it's Daivari!  Hassan then attacks Jericho from behind.  Benoit comes to the ring and saves Jericho while Flair creeps to the back.  Bischoff comes out and announces a tag match between Daivari & Hassan vs. Jericho & Benoit.

No winner:

Daivari & Muhammed Hassan vs. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit.

 Daivari cannot wrestle!  Benoit puts the Crossface on Daivari and he taps but Flair! comes back and hits Benoit, then Batista comes out and runs over Flair.  Benoit locks the Crossface back on Daivari and he taps.

Winners: Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit 5 out of 10

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme vs. Jazz vs. Victoria vs. Molly Holly vs. Lita in a 6-pack Elimination match for the Women's Title.

Winner: Matt Hardy 7 out of 10

Shelton Benjamin vs. Gene Snitsky for the Intercontinental Championship in a No Disqualifications Match:

 Before the match Bischoff said that if either opponent gets out of control they lose even thought it's no DQ's.  Snitsky goes crazy hits Benjamin with 2 chairs puts him through a table.  He even throws him off a ladder.  Bischoff Disqualifies Benjamin!?!?!?!?  He said that Benjamin didn't give an effort.  Snitsky asked for the belt and Bischoff hit him with it.

Winner: I guess Gene Snitsky 4.5 out of 10

HBK and Angle confront for the 3rd time.  At this point they are beating the crud out of each other.  Long and Bischoff agree that at the Rumble they will meet in a Special Stipulation Match.  They agree the stipulation will be......3 Stages of Hell!!!  1st Fall Street Fight:  2nd Fall Hell In A Cell: 3rd Fall if needed Last Man Standing!!!

Triple H vs. Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage Match:

 This was a war.  Triple H gets cut up it the first 5 minutes.  Flair does everything he can to interfere.  Batista doesn't want to escape because Flair was swinging chairs and such at him and HHH wasn't hurt enough.  Finally HHH knocks down Batista, Flair slides him the sledgehammer through the cage.  He hits Batista in the midsection followed by the Pedigree for 3.

Winner: HHH 10 out of 10

This was an ok match. When Eugene gets in, he's on fire, but when he dropkicks Tomko, he injures his knee cap. It's cool to see how Tomko and Christian still wrestle Eugene. While Cristian beats up Regal on the out side, Eugene rolls up Tomko at 16 minuets and holds the tights for the victory. 7/10

2. Trish Stratus vs. Lita for the Womens title

2 injuries in a row! Lita injures her knee on a crossbody to the outside on Trish. At 4 minuets, Trish chick kicks Lita for the win. 5/10

These guys mat wrestle for 1-2 minuets. Maven gets out of the ring and cuts a nice 6 minute promo, gets bak in the ring,and benjamin rolls him up immediately and wins. But Maven wants a rematch and tells Benjamin that there are 2 wommens champions. Benjamin runs in the ring,ducks Mavens clothesline, and t-bone suplexes him for the win. Very entertaining. 10/10

2193914,3,B0006SSNW8,"Let me say that HHH vs. Batista at WrestleMania will be the best Main Event in WrestleMania history as long as Flair stays out.  Here is the card in my order.

Muhammad Hassan def. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

In a rare pay-per-view in-ring appearance, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler was not only battling for himself, he was sticking up for the people of America. And with Jim Ross in his corner, the former AWA World Champion Lawler looked impressive.

Muhammad Hassan, however, had not only strength and youth on his side, but he also had Khosrow Daivari. After being distracted by outside interference by Daivari, Lawler was caught in a reverse Rock Bottom by Hassan. The impact proved to be enough, as Hassan picked up the win in his first-ever WWE pay-per-view match.

WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP

William Regal & Eugene def. Christian & Tyson Tomko

The World Tag Team Championship kicked off the New Year's Revolution pay-per-view event. The challengers, Christian and Tyson Tomko, walked to the ring to a chorus of boos. However, the cheers the champions, Eugene and William Regal, received were just as boisterous.

Eugene, who was competing while wearing a T-shirt reminiscent of Hollywood Hogan circa 1985, suffered what appeared to be a horrible injury to his left knee. Despite competing on one leg, Eugene found the strength inside to roll up Tomko from behind for the win. As a result, Eugene and Regal retained their World Tag Team Championship.

 INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP

Shelton Benjamin def. Maven (twice)

With the sold-out crowd solidly against him, Maven threatened to not compete at all in this match. In fact, to further add insult to the crowd, Maven said that he would only face Shelton Benjamin on United States soil. As Maven started to walk back to the dressing room area, the referee began to count the challenger out. It was then that Maven had second thoughts. Finally, before the ref reached the count of 10, Maven ran back into the ring. The decision proved to be a poor one for Maven, as Benjamin quickly rolled up his challenger for the win.

Embarrassed, Maven challenged Benjamin to a rematch. Always the fighting champion, Benjamin complied. In even quicker fashion, however, Benjamin hit Maven with the T-Bone Suplex, picking up his secind win of the evening.

Kane def. Gene Snitsky

With his wife, Lita, already injured from her match earlier in the night, Kane battled long-time rival Gene Snitsky in a powerful encounter.

Both men pulled out all the stops, including Snitsky biting Kane's ear, a la Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield. While the ear biting seemed like a good idea to Snitsky, it actually appeared to enrage Kane. Not long after, Kane picked Snitsky up and dropped him with a Tombstone. A three count later, Kane was declared the winner.

WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP

Trish Stratus def. Lita

Lita and Trish Stratus have one of the most storied rivalries in the history of women's wrestling. Most recently, Lita defeated Trish for the Women's Championship on the Dec. 6 edition of Monday Night RAW.

At New Year's Revolution, the battle continued. This time, however, the decision went Stratus' way, as Trish dropped Lita for a count of three after hitting her with her patented Chick Kick.

Just prior to the pinfall, Lita attempted a Lou Thesz Press from the ring apron out to the arena floor. Unfortunately for Lita, the move resulted in an apparent injury to her left knee, leaving her as easy prey for Trish.

The win gave Trish a record sixth reign as Women's Champion.

ELIMINATION CHAMBER FOR THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

Triple H def. Batista, Y2J, Chris Benoit, Edge, Randy Orton

Before the Elimination Chamber even got underway, Edge was seen in Eric Bischoff's office attempting to weasel his way out of the match. According to Edge, there was no way he could win the match with Shawn Michaels as the ref. He couldn't have been closer to the truth. After Edge apparently inadvertently Speared HBK, Michaels returned the favor with Sweet Chin Music. Chris Jericho then hit Edge with the Lionsault, which spelled the end for Edge.

Chris Benoit, who was one of the first participants in the Elimination Chamber along with Y2J, was the next to be eliminated. While on the mat in excruciating pain, Batista delivered a Spinebuster to Y2J right on top of the fallen Benoit. Batista then covered Benoit for the win.

Batista wasn't done there. His next victim was Jericho. Already bloody and battered, Y2J fell to a Batista Bomb.

With Edge, Benoit and Jericho all out of the Elimination Chamber, it was an all Evolution finals, as Batista and Triple are current members, while Randy Orton is now a former Evolution member.

Keeping true to his word, Batista worked well with Triple H, as both men decimated Orton. However, Orton did manage to muster up enough energy to catch an unsuspecting Batista with the RKO, which was followed by the pin.

In the end, it was a bloody Triple H dropping the Pedigree on Randy Orton. The win marked Triple H's 10th reign at the top. To celebrate, Batista held Triple H on his shoulders, while Ric Flair paraded around with his thumbs up.

It would only rent New Year's Revolution.  If you liked my card better then the WWE's say the review was helpful say it wasn't.",1111017600,,5265,4.841517857142857

It's a shame the match ended the way it did. Lita had got the title three weeks ago before this match and she loses it!!!!  We have another injury for the night. Plus, with Lita gone it just hurts the women's division EVEN MORE. This match went on for 4 or 5 minutes at least because of the injury. Trish gets the win making her 5 time women's champion. Rating: *

Muhammad Hassan vs. Jerry ''The King'' Lawler
Not a very good match period, but I have seen worst. It was funny how Hassan's manager (Daivari) got chased by J.R though. Hassan hits his finisher (don't even know the name of it yet) on Lawler to get the win. Rating: **

Intercontinental Championship
Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven
Wow, I guess the Maven push ends here. This match was VERY QUICK. Maven does some nice mike work, says he's leaving runs back in the ring before he gets counted out and Shelton rolls him up for the win??!! Maven then does some more mike work and tells Benjamin to get back in the ring, looks like we have a second match of this. Benjamin comes back in the ring hits the T-bone suplex and gets another win!!!!! Shameful how WWE didn't give these guys more time than this. Rating: * 1/2

Kane vs. Gene Snistky
I pretty much liked all of the matches these two been in. This one was okay, didn't like it as much as their match at Taboo Tuesday. But it was still a nice match. I loved the ending when Kane does the tombstone to Snistky. Rating *** 1/2

Elimination Chamber Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Batista vs. Edge vs. Triple H, Guess Referee: Shawn Michaels
Awesome match!!!!  I think many will agree with me that this is the second best elimination chamber ever. The Summerslam 2003 one wasn't all that good. Many great moments in this match, the one that I will remember the most is Benoit's diving headbutt off top of one of the chambers. J.R's reaction to that on commentary (after Benoit did it) while very funny was right on the button. Batista was VERY over with the crowd in this match. They even boo'ed when Orton elimatied him from the match. Triple H gets the win after a little help from Batista to beat Orton and become a ten time world heavyweight champion. Rating: *****

Like I said before the main event saved the pay per view.  The DVD has more extras but not many. It has three promos (commericals) of the New Year's Revolutionn matches. And it has all the interviews of each wrestler that was in the chamber match. If you think about buying the DVD, buy it for this match only. But then again, I won't blame you if you rent it.",1109462400,,3222,4.372909698996655
2193917,3,B0006SSNW8,"World Tag Team Championship

William Regal & Eugene vs. Christian & Tyson Tomko

Both tag division are under fire and I'm not sure why.  This is an enjoybale opening match that sees Eugene's dislocated patella.  It didn't look that bad but he was in real pain.  The other 3 picked up the slack nicely.  I like this match.

Women's Championship

Lita vs. Trish Stratus

Wasn't too excited about this as they've wrestled at least 2 million times.  Only reason this is watchable is Lita's knee injury too.  There seemed to be a hex that night.  It looks bad but I give her credit for finishing the match and even taking an ankle lock.

Intercontinental Championship

Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven

Oh brother.  They were all set to push Maven until they realized his work ethic apparently stinks.  It's a squash.  He cuts a good promor before but it's over in less than 10 seconds.  I really like Shelton but they need to give him some credible heels.

Muhammad Hassan vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

Hassan has mic skills but that's where it stops.  It consists of body slam, punches, rest holds and the finisher.  That's it.  Hassan isn't looking to promising anymore.  Although the crowd helped this match out a little.

Kane vs. Gene Snitsky

I was looking forward to this only for the fact that it should've ended this feud.  This match is better than Taboo Tuesday.  There's more moves and even high flying. Just be glad this feud is over.

Elimination Chamber Match for the World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H vs. Batista vs. Edge vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho

2193918,3,B0006SSNW8,"So starts the year of 2005 for World Wrestling Entertainment, and what a slow start it is. This ppv was definately not worth 35 bucks for, I don't care how great the main event was. As for buying it for only 20+ bucks, well, I'll let you decide if it is worth it.

World Tag Team Championships

William Regal and Eugene [champions] vs. La Resistance

The tag team division, even if you combined the two brands, is a joke. Out of all the championships the wwe has, this is the worst that has fallen down the ladder.

It amazes me that the crowd actually liked this match, no disrespect to Regal or Eugene, but this sucked. Eugene tries to bring some life into this match, but to no avail. He also hurts his knee. La Resistance wins..... again! 7/10

Women's Championship

Lita [champion] vs. Trish Stratus

Again, this match was cut short by Lita's injury. Trish dominated but what can you expect with Lia injured? It will be a long 6-8 months before Lita returns. Trish wins to become a 6 time woman's champ. 6.5/10

Intercontinental Championship

Shelton Benjamin [champion] vs. Maven

What a waste of a spark of a new rivalry. Maven gets kicked to the curb and Shelton still has a spot open for a worthy rival. Shelton wins a very short match and Maven whines about it, so Shelton wrestled him again and beat him again! 7/10

Muhammad Hussan vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

Ha Ha, so Muhammad has about enough total experience as a serious wrestler for how many days? Not even this ""push"" could get me to take him seriously. Add the fact at what happened at the Rumble, and his screaming sidekick and you got yourself a grade A quality joke.

As for the match, not great, but I managed to watch it, if that surprises you. I just thought that the crowd reaction for him was good for a heel, even if he is taken seriously, which is probably rare anywhere. Hussan wins. 6/10

Kane vs. Snitsky

Kane returns with a vengeane. The second time they fought was, in my opinion, was the worst of the three encounters. Their no holds barred match was great, in the end. As for this, not so.

I don't know who can do the best snarl out of these two. Snitsky tries to use a steel chair, but Kane blocks it and lands it right back in Snitsky's face. 7.5/10 [Highest score so far, but I liked the crowd's enthusiasm.]

Elimination Chamber

World Heavyweight championship

Triple H, vs Chris Benoit, vs. Batista, vs. Edge, vs. Randy Orton, vs. Chris Jericho - Shawn Michales Special referee

Well, that makes it two out of three for great chamber matches. The one that didn't do it for me was the second one, at summerslam 03. Highlights of this one include Benoit giving an unbelievable headbutt off one of the cells, and Batista just dominating the whole thing when he left his cell.

Blood and guys getting thrown into the chain walls galore. Shawn even gives the superkick to Edge, leading to their match at the Royal Rumble. Triple H wins to become an impressive 10 time champ. Whether he derseves that title as a ten time champ is up to you to decide. 10/10

This is definately not worth it, my opinion, but you have to at least rent it to see the great Chamber match. [Also to the guy in the other review, it is not a hell in the cell match, get it right if you are going to pretend to be a fan of wrestling]",1108857600,,3298,4.389802631578948

2193921,4,B0006SSNW8,"the entire card, except for the main event looked to be basic raw matches. nothing special except for back to back knee injuries (Lita/Eugene) that stood out in the opening 5 matches. Maven/Benjamin was a complete waste....what are they doing with Maven's character? he could be one of the top heels, he's got the mic skills. it's wierd watching a WWE match without commentary and that's what you get with Hassan vs. Lawler. the upside after the match is that Coach joined the commentary to help out a little. Snitsky/Kane has been done to death and this match was nothing different than any other Kane/Snitsky match you have seen before.

the main event, the third installment to the elimination chamber match was worth the dvd alone. it's not the spotfest like the first elimination chamber back in survivor series 2002, but it was a pretty solid wrestling match. the only thing that disappointed me was the anti-climactic finish. it wasn't a suprise finish (even if you didn't watch Raw anytime after NYR), you know who's walking out with the title even before the match begins.

this DVD doesn't contain much in the special features section, no bonus match for this event and the interviews were self explanatory. nothing special in this section

Its suppose to generate excitement for WWE fans and get them pumped to want to get Wrestlemaina 21. So far, nothing has made me want to get the PPV. No matchs have been announced as of February 07, 2005 and six weeks to go. The WWE tag team divison is a joke, the intercontinental divison is non existent. The Raw shows put up PPV quailty shows each and every week, so buying a PPV is like paying money to watch Raw. Mark my words, WWE is going fail in 2005. Triple H will keep his title, while other opponents lay down for him. I haven't watched a full edition of Raw for over 3 years, because its so predictable and stale.

World Tag Team Championship Match

William Regal & Eugene(c) def. Christian & Tyson Tomko

Ok opening match. Eugene injured his knee he will be out for some time most likely will miss the Royal Rumble Match and WrestleMania 21:  6/10

Women's Championship Match

Trish Stratus def. Lita (c)

Again a bad break for WWE Lita like Eugene injured her knee after a crossbody outside of the ring to Trish Stratus and will need ACL surgery and also most likely miss WrestleMania 21. This match wasn't as good that they had on RAW on Dec. 2004  4/10

Intercontinental Championship Match

Shelton Benjamin def. Maven

What the hell ?! Maven finally getting a push but, he get beat by Shelton 3 times and in the first match it lasted 3 minutes and Maven got angry and said that he can beat Benjamin in second match but we all know what happen there.  2/10

NOTE: This match was bad due to very bad matches at House Shows before the PPV really it was because of Maven not Benjamin due to this quick match.

Muhammad Hassan def. Jerry Lawler

A great in-ring debut for Hassan showing that he can go in the ring even with a legend like Jerry Lawler. Hassan beat King with a Flatliner.  7/10

Kane def. Gene Snitsky

Snitsky had nothing on Kane in this match and everything he did Kane would just sit right back up. In the end Kane did something he never does and pulled of a Tombstone.

WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP

William Regal & Eugene def. Christian & Tyson Tomko

The World Tag Team Championship kicked off the New Year's Revolution pay-per-view event.  The challengers, Christian and Tyson Tomko, walked to the ring to a chorus of boos.  However, the cheers the champions, Eugene and William Regal, recieved were just as boisterous.  Eugene, who was competing while wearing a T-shirt reminiscent of Hollywood Hogan circa 1985, suffered what appeared to be a horrible knee injury to his left knee.  Despite competing on one leg, Eugene found the strength inside to roll up Tomko from behind for the win.  As a result, Eugene and Regal retained their World Tag Team Championship.**

WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP

Trish Stratus def. Lita

Lita and Trish Stratus have one of the most storied rivalries in the history of women's wrestling.  Most recently, Lita defeated Trish for the Women's Championship on the Dec. 6 edition of Monday Night RAW.  At New Year's Revolution, the battle continued.  This time, however, the decision went Stratus' way, as Trish dropped Lita for a count of three after hitting her with her patented Chick Kick.  Just prior to the pinfall, Lita attempted a Lou Thesz Press from the ring apron out to the arena floor.  Unfortunately for Lita, the move resulted in an apparent injury to her left knee, leaving her as easy prey for Trish.  The win gave Trish a record sixth reign as Women's Champion.****

Muhammed Hassan def. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

In a rare pay-per-view in-ring appearence, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler was not only battling for himself, he was sticking up for the people of America.  And with Jim Ross in his corner, the former AWA World Champion Lawler looked impressive.  Muhammed Hassan, however, had not only strength and youth on his side, but he also had Khosrow Daivari.  After being distracted by outside interference by Daivari, Lawler was caught in a reverse Rock Bottom by Hassan.  The impact proved to be enough, as Hassan picked up the win in his first-ever WWE pay-per-view.**

INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP

Shelton Benjamin def. Maven (twice)

With the sold-out crowd solidly against him, Maven threatened to not compete at all in this match.  In fact, to further add insult to the crowd, Maven said that he would only face Shelton Benjamin on United States soil.  As Maven started to walk back to the dressing room area, the referee began to count the challenger out.  It was then that Maven had second thoughts.  Finally, before the ref reached the count of 10, Maven ran back into the ring.  The decision proved to be a poor one for Maven, as Benjamin quickly rolled up his challenger for the win.  Embarrassed, Maven challenged Benjamin to a rematch.  Always the fighting champion, Benjamin compiled.  In even quicker fashion, however, Benjamin hit Maven with the T-Bone Suplex, picking up his secind win of the evening.**

Kane def. Gene Snitsky

With his wife, Lita, already injured from her match earlier in the night, Kane battled long-time rival Gene Snitsky in a powerful encounter.  Both men pulled out all the stops, including Snitsky biting Kane's ear, a la Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.  While the ear biting seemed like a good idea to Snitsky, it actually appeared to enrage Kane.  Not long after, Kane picked Snitsky up and dropped him with a Tombstone.  A three count later, Kane was declared the winner.**

ELIMINATION CHAMBER FOR THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

Triple H def. Batista, Y2J, Chris Benoit, Edge, Randy Orton

Before the Elimination Chamber got underway, Edge was seen in Eric Bischoff's office attempting to weasel his way out of the match.  According to Edge, thre was no way he could win the match with Shawn Michaels as the ref.  He couldn't have been closer to the truth.  After Edge apparently inadvertenly Speared HBK, Michaels returned the favor with Sweet Chin Music.  Chris Jericho then hit Edge with the Lionsault, which spelled the end for Edge.  Chris Benoit, who was one of the first participants in the Elimination Chamber along with Y2J, was the next to be eliminated.  While on the mat in excruciating pain, Batista delivered a Spinebuster to Y2J right on top of the fallen Benoit.  Batista covered Benoit for the win.  Batista wasn't done there.  His next victim was Jericho.  Already bloody and battered, Y2J fell to a Batista Bomb.  With Edge, Benoit  and Jericho all out of the Elimination Chamber, it was an all Evolution finals, as Batista and Triple are current members, while Randy Orton is now a former Evolution member.  Keeping true to his word, Batista worked well with Triple H, as both men decimated Orton.  However, Orton did manage to muster up enough energy to catch an unsuspecting Batista with an RKO, which was followed by the pin.  In the end, it was a bloody Triple H dropping the Pedigree on Randy Orton.  The win marked Triple H's 10th reign at the top.  To celebrate, Batista held Triple H on his shoulders, while Ric Flair paraded around with his thumbs up.*****

1. Tag Team match for the world tag team championship
Christian & Tyson Tomko vs. The World tag team champions William Regal and Eugene (yeah it's not a typo)
Three out of four of these guys are good wrestlers, so I was hoping for a good opener but darn Tomko is rough and not the good way, I mean a simply close line will break your noise, and I know Eugene's gimmick is about all of this mental person stuff but why have Christian; a guy with talent and someone who can get a reaction be the butt of these jokes? Anyways When the pace started speeding up we had our second injury of the night from Eugene, which caused a lame finish. Glad a certain someone didn't get pinned though.

2. Singles match for the Womens Championship
Trish Stratus vs. Womens Champion Lita
Another injury forced this match to a minute long; I was disappointed in that since I know these two can have a great match.

3. Singles Match for the INC. title
there was two moves in this match; not a good idea since the other championships match had problems

4. Muhammad Hassan vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler
Nothing PPV worthy here, just a match to have the new star Muhammad Hassan to beat a legend. This match should be a match that you watch today and say "" Look at the WWE Champion we just started wrestling"" but yeah things got unlucky for Hassan.

5. Kane vs. Gene Snitsky
Snitsky's best match by far; Kane deserves the respect that he has for making a Gene Snitsky match good( yes that is not a typo) no slow points which is good because the Puerto Rico crowd would ripped the match up. Anyways thank you Kane for getting me to enjoy a Gene Snitsky match. The ending was gross, it looked like he got killed.
6. fatal four way Chicken fight
Val Venus/Stacey Kiebler vs. Maria/Rob Conway vs. Hurricane/Candice vs. Christy?Rosey
Great action here, second match of the night. Christy Hemme's second ppv win

6. Elimination chamber for the vacated world title with Shawn Michaels as referee
Triple H vs. Batista vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Invisible man
hard impact move is what I am using to describe this match; I felt like I got a concussion from just watching this match, everyone was bleeding, everyone was show cased and everyone looked awesome. There was one funny botch that is easy to notice but still great stuff. Some how this match is forgotten, maybe because of who won, but if you're into intense graphic wrestling then you'll enjoy this match.

Overall I enjoyed the show, yes the undercard got messed up due to injuries but the crowd was awesome, they booed everything a heel did and cheered everything that deserved to be cheered.
