8217423,4,B000JVSX7C,"Well my boyfriend and I were looking through videos in the adult section of ""Movies U Buy"" and surprisingly he brought Volume 1 of this DVD to my attention(Volume 1 is not on Amazon, but I thought it deserved a review). We watched it. It goes through middle aged couples, how they keep their love making interesting, meaningful, and fun; both speaking about and performing their tips for the camera.
The thing is, my boyfriend and I are 20, not 40, so this threw us off a bit at first..but we do act like an old married couple most of the time; and we had an amazing time after watching this. It gave us a whole new perspective on our lovemaking and got us to explore eachother's bodies all over again.
Now I will try and find Volume 2 and 3 :)",1281916800,2,744,4.246478873239437
