5424134,4,B00AG477ME,"This video is a must see for any Eagles fan. It chronicles how Desean Jackson made his way to the NFL through hard work and with the support of a dedicated family. It paints a much more nuanced image of a guy who is frequently portrayed as a privileged, uncaring athlete by some in the media.",1372118400,,292,4.232142857142857
5424135,4,B00AG477ME,"As an Eagles fan, I felt a bit obligated to watch this documentary. I read about the Eagles any chance I get and I know a lot about the players on the team. So going into the film I really didn't know what to expect of the film's content and I had rather low expectations. After viewing, I was blown away at the fascinating story told by DeSean's brother, Byron.

This film is as good as any other football film out there, fiction or non-fiction. If you are a fan of football, you will love his film. Byron takes you through a journey of developing a professional football player. From an early age, DeSean was surrounded by a support team that trained him and pushed him to be his best. You witness his high school success, the college recruiting circus, college success and conflict, draft day, and finally, taking the NFL by storm. If you had any question how DeSean was so successful his first couple years in the NFL this film will provide the answer.

The view inside his family's dynamic was also very interesting. His father was tough and alienated some but you can tell that he loved his family and only wanted the best for his kids. It was very touching the shots of Bill watching DeSean's NFL games while he battled cancer and their interaction together during his final days.

The film ends after his second season in the NFL, when he becomes the first player to be voted to the Pro Bowl at two different positions in the same year. A lot has happened since that time. If this film was available at that time it might have foretold the coming contract issue that he experienced in his fourth season. DeSean owed his success to a lot of people and I am sure he felt obligated to pay them back. Now that he has done that I hope his best years are ahead of him. As I watch him this upcoming season, I will have a new outlook and respect for the player and person he is.",1372032000,,1878,4.329545454545454
5424136,5,B00AG477ME,"What does it take to realize a dream? Watch this movie and find out. The story of how DeSean Jackson with the help of his family and friends began at an early age to make his dream of being in the NFL come true. His father was a driving force and his talent and desire all came together to produce a player that made history.
Never under estimate the power of having a father's  love and guidance in a child's life.",1371513600,,415,4.1234567901234565
5424137,5,B00AG477ME,"This was good and insightful. As the saying goes it takes a village to raise a child, this documentary shows how much that is true and in how many different ways it's true. Team Jackson was awesome and committed and succeeded in reaching their ultimate goal.",1366934400,4,258,4.630434782608695
5424138,5,B00AG477ME,"I think he's special.  Hes 5'9"" and 175lb a guy that did not just make it in the league but dominates.  Allows every father in America who has a son or daughter with athletic aspirations to say work hard and you can achieve your goals

It also was a great example of how his father and family had a structure in place with good principles but it wasn't too overbearing.  They allowed Desean to be himself and develop into a young man within that family structure without restricting his individuality.  Which I believe is a big reason for his success.  Even with his father gone.  You can look at DeSean and see the same person in the documentary and realize he's a good kid thats been raised correctly and still strong values learned from his father.

Good Father and Good Son",1396569600,,777,4.460992907801418
5424139,5,B00AG477ME,Great documentary. Recoomend it for anybody! Especially if you are a football fan. Desean Jackson plays for more than just himself. Love him after this.

5424143,4,B00AG477ME,As a life long Eagles fan... obviously I love this vid and DeSean.  I only gave it 4 stars because the film and the media portrayed Jackson's dad to be a mad control freak -- which he was at times and that scared some teams -- but DeSean might not have gotten to the NFL without him.  Yea it's a paradox for sure.,1389916800,,313,3.9523809523809526

He use to get on my nerve a bit with his show boating at the end lines but now this has really made me see him a bit different. Men, you should really go get your prostate screening done.. Please.. Oh, this was another take away for me. I told my brother to make sure he did this and he advised that he already did.",1384214400,,476,3.86734693877551

5424157,5,B00AG477ME,"Bill Jackson's dream to be the father of an NFL star was several decades in the making. His eldest son Byron, one of the directors of the film, made it as far as the Chiefs' practice squad in the `90s - but it was only in 2008 that Bill Jackson's dream actually came true. ""DeSean Jackson: The Making of a Father's Dream"" uses several years' worth of private footage to document the long and difficult process of bringing this dream into fruition, and offers an intimate and sympathetic portrait of both DeSean and his father. I'd recommend it not only to sports fans but anyone who enjoys a good biographical film.",1372204800,,615,4.54954954954955
8551232,5,B00AG477ME,"My son and I cried at the end. We mirror the relationship between Desean and his pops.
