398565,3,6301972821,"Pandemonium (Alfred Sole, 1982)

You know a movie's not your favorite when you've seen it before, but you don't realize it until you're twenty minutes into the movie. I saw Pandemonium last night for the first time in twenty years, and, well, that happened. But really, it wasn't as bad as all that.

Sole, who also directed the horror classic Alice, Sweet Alice, stepped out of the director's chair forever after directing this bona fide bomb that was, perhaps, two or three years before its time (had it been a direct-to-video flick, it probably would have gained an immediate cult following instead of languishing in obscurity). (Sole has since become a top-drawer production designer.) But really, is it as bad as all that?

It certainly sounds like it is. A serial killer shish-ke-bobs a group of cheerleaders in 1963. Fast forward twenty years, and Bambi (Catch Me if You Can's Candy Azzara), who wanted to be a cheerleader back in those days but didn't quite make the cut, has reopened the cheerleader camp at It Had to Be U. (You can see where the humor's going already, can't you?) This is the second year of its operation, and we're told that last year's camp had some, well, mishaps. Needless to say, this year won't be any different.

Where the movie breaks out of its role as a Student Bodies (Mickey Rose, 1981) wannabe is with the casting. Sole not only lined up a huge number of big names to work on this spoof (including male and female leads Tom Smothers and Carol Kane, major roles for Match Game regular Debralee Scott, The Funhouse's Mark McClure and Miles Chapin, The Devil and Max Devlin's Teri Landrum [the only actress in the film who never worked in front of the screen again],  cameos by Eve Arden, Tab Hunter, Eileen Brennan, Edie McClurg, and many more), but also took some chances on three actors who were just at the beginnings of their comedic careers: Paul Rubens, Phil Hartman, and Judge Reinhold. All three, previously character actors, were destined for stardom within a few years (Reinhold broke out in 1984's Beverly Hills Cop; Rubens started Pee-Wee's Playhouse in 1986; Hartman, also a Pee-Wee's Playhouse regular, joined the cast of Saturday Night Live the same year). The jokes are also marginally more clever than they are in most horror movie spoofs; Scary Movie and its followers could have learned quite a bit from watching this flick. It does descend to the gutter on a fairly regular basis, but there's some clever humor in the mix, and it always comes as an unexpected surprise. About the only thing missing was McClure asking Scott if she wanted to blank.

A minor film, but unjustly overlooked. May not belong in the same class as Airplane!, but to put it in the bargain bin with the rest of the early-eighties brainless comedies would be a mistake. ***",1090800000,16,2804,4.735655737704918
398566,3,6301972821,"This is a good movie, but not great.  Most of the acting is good, particularly that of Carol Kane and Paul Reubens.
Kane plays Candy, a young girl who goes off to cheerleading camp to be like all the other girls and get away from her sheltered life.  Once Cheerleading camp begins, the other cheerleaders start dropping like flies.
Paul Reubens is particularly memorable as Johnson, Cooper's (Tom Smothers) human sidekick.  Johnson is jealous of Cooper's Horse who seems to be more trusted than him.
There are a couple of good laughs in here.  It's worth it if you get it for a cheap price.",1022284800,,590,4.59047619047619
398567,4,6301972821,"It has been years since I've seen this movie, but I remember a few things about it.  I recall Pee Wee being so very subtle in his Pee Wee ways.  I also had a hoot and a hollar over the toothbrush murder and the  ""cookies and milk"" bath scene.  If you are a fan of campy horror  flicks, or you just enjoy making fun of them, then check out this movie.",936748800,10,350,3.8732394366197185

I'm 30, so the only copy I've seen is an old VHS my mother tapes off of TV. I would LOVE to be able to buy this digitally or on DVD, but it's impossible to find!
