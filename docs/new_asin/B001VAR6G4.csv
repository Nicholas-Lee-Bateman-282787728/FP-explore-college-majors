3820211,4,B001VAR6G4,This movie was hilarious. you have to love Neal and Bob. they cracked me up. I would recommend this for just pure fun and slap stick silly humor,1245715200,,144,4.178571428571429
3820212,4,B001VAR6G4,"If you like your flicks sweet, nice, and neat, do not see this movie! On the other hand, if you like raunchy jokes, gross-out gags, and hot babes, you just might love it. The plot won't be confused with a Russian novel, but for some yuks and stupid fun I think this one is worth the effort. Some of the scenes I still laugh about when I think of them. The Asian chick is hot, and the goody two shoes babe is really one of the prettiest girls I've seen. She's been on some TV I think (Veronica Mars, maybe?). When you're in the mood for mindless laughs, check this one out.",1245283200,8,572,4.116071428571429
3820213,4,B001VAR6G4,"Reminds me of Police Academy or Super Troopers.  I thought it was ver well done.  Also, lots of pretty girls and good acting.",1245283200,,125,4.391304347826087
3820214,5,B001VAR6G4,This movie is very funny. It's made kind of cheap but very much worth the money. I don't know who wouldn't want to watch it.,1362009600,,124,4.0
3820215,4,B001VAR6G4,nice item. price is good. couldn't have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.,1359072000,,120,5.05
3820216,1,B001VAR6G4,I am telling you this is the worst movie ever made.  being an EMT/Firefighter I though there would be some better work related humor but not so.  it was a hige waste of my time and a huge disappointment.,1338076800,,203,4.17948717948718
3820217,1,B001VAR6G4,"terrible terrible. not terribly funny
work in ems and fire, hated this movie. Just terrible
I did get it quickly from seller and everything, it is just that the movie is no good at all.",1328486400,,185,4.314285714285714
3820218,5,B001VAR6G4,the product was great and in great condition and lastly arrived in a timely fashion,1289001600,,83,4.6
3820219,2,B001VAR6G4,"Frankly, This movie was terrible. Not what I expected. Being a paramedic I figured this would be a fun, humerous movie with a good plot. While it was funny at time, it is nothing I would spend a lot of money for. The plot was rather childish at times, not how I wanted to see EMS portrayed.
If you did infact want a humerous movie about public safety, I would recommend Super Troopers, or if you wanted a paramedic movie I would recommend, Bringing out the Dead, both good movies.",1282694400,4,480,4.344444444444444
3820220,1,B001VAR6G4,"This movie is not even close to being funny. It's unrated, not sure why. It should be rated a ""G"" as there is no nudity in this stinker. Skid Marks is really a good name for this flick, as it is what was left after I flushed it. Save your money and look elsewhere.",1279929600,,264,3.9074074074074074
3820221,3,B001VAR6G4,tHIS IS A REAL GOOD MOVIE FOR THE PRICE.  IF YOU LIKE SILLY COMEDY.  THIS IS A MOVIE FOR YOU.,1275609600,,93,3.6
3820222,1,B001VAR6G4,"Being an EMS provider for 11 years, I was eager for this movie to come out.  Holy lord, was I disappointed.  The plot was horrible, the acting was shamefully bad, and the audio for the dialogue sounded like everything was dubbed over.  Terrible movie altogether.",1250467200,,262,4.777777777777778
3820223,4,B001VAR6G4,"Yo Peeps,  I watched this hilarious flick last nite and almost had to change my shorts I laughed so f'n hard!  Serious, make sure your stomach is on empty when watching or you'll be sorry!  It is non stop racy action comedy dudes and plenty of hot chicks too!  If you're looking for some good times and laughs while partyin' it up, then this is definitely the flick for you bro!",1247616000,,378,4.28169014084507

8345845,1,B001VAR6G4,One nude scene. Some strippers are on stage and their topless. Also after the you got an hour into the movie it would stop playing and then start playing again. Wish I wouldn't have bought it.,1432339200,,192,4.361111111111111
8345846,1,B001VAR6G4,"I bought this for my husband.  We saw the previews somewhere.  It seemed raunchy.  I didn't think I would like it, but he wanted it, so I ordered it for him.  He hates it.  It has to be pretty bad for him to dislike something so much.  He likes everything.  I guess they left the funny parts out.  It was just stupid.",1399852800,,317,4.0
8345847,1,B001VAR6G4,"save your time and money and skip this one .... if u watch it, u may leave skid marks in your undergarments!",1392940800,,108,3.9545454545454546

8345850,5,B001VAR6G4,"This is a great Comedy film.... full of laughs and great random sarcastic energy. This movie is like a great mixture of american pie, van wilder, and films alike but without the preppy frat boy style. This is a great movie with great antics and sarcasm featuring great characters. I have no idea why this movie is so under the radar.... it should be a big hit movie.",1374451200,,366,4.397058823529412
