3772888,4,B001R3YRIA,"My kids love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse in all its glory. They wanted to watch this one for a week straight whenever they had a chance. I enjoy this show, it doesn't grate my nerves like some other kids shows do and the kids seem to learn from it and enjoy it. If you like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse definitely add this to your collection, if you're new to the show I'd recommend giving it a try.",1245110400,,388,4.1866666666666665
3772889,5,B001R3YRIA,"""MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE"" is a children's television animated series (presented in CG) that airs on the Disney Channel's ""Playhouse Disney"" block targeted towards pre-school children.

The series is created in a similar style as ""Blue's Clues"" and ""Dora the Explorer"" in terms of the main character interacting with the viewer.  ""MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE"" features Mickey Mouse as the main character communicating with his friends and then occasionally looking towards the viewer for help in a variety of adventures.

Mickey Mouse uses a variety of tools and a compass to help them solve their problems and get from point A to point B.

For this DVD release of ""Mickey's Big Splash"", the theme revolves around the Summer time.  The episodes features a total of four episodes (24:05 minutes each) which include:

  1. Donald's Ducks - This bonus episode features Mickey Mouse, Pluto, Donald Duck and Goofy.  As the two hang out at the clubhouse, they hear ducks quacking.  The group finds eight ducks that need help getting to the beach for the Winter.  Using Mickey's mousketools, the viewer must help Mickey decide which tools can be used to help get the ducks to the beach.

  2. Pluto's Bubble Bath - This episode features Mickey Mouse, Minny Mouse and Pluto.  With Pluto playing outdoors, he's gotten muddy and thus he needs to get a bath.  Using Mickey's mousketools, the viewer must help Mickey decide which tools to use for a bath.  But when the bubbles start to grow and become more powerfu, Mickey and Pluto are caught in a bubble and taken high above the planet and the viewer along with Donald Duck and Goofy must find a way to get them down.

  3. Mickey Goes Fishing - Goofy is going on vacation and has to leave his kitten, Mr. Pettibone with Mickey.  But somehow all Mr. Pettibone's gooey fish must have fallen out of the box when Goofy stopped by and now Mickey and the viewer must find a way to get more fish to feed Goofy's kitten.

  4. Pete's Beach Blanket Luau - The temperature is quite hot and Mickey and friends want to cool down.  Pete invites Mickey and his friends to come to his beach blanket luau at Star Lake.  Mickey asks the viewer if they can help him and the friends setup a luau at the beach.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE"" features colorful CG animated episodes for the children.  Nothing too detailed but simple and clean enough for the young children to enjoy.  Presentation is in Full Screen and an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.

As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital Surround Sound plus French and Spanish language tracks.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD comes with a game called ""Fun in the Sun with Mickey and the Gang Game"" (featured only in English).  As the group is setting up the luau, the viewer can use their remote or computer mouse to help Donald Duck select items that don't belong on the beach.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE"" is a straightforward DVD release for parents to have their children watch (or assist the children in helping them make decisions).

Each of the four episodes are family friendly and include Mickey Mouse and many of his friends during the Summer.  From helping ducks get to the beach, Pluto getting clean after stepping in the mud, Mickey going fishing for food for Goofy's kitten and helping set up a luau at Star Lake.

The DVD is targeted towards parents who have children that are around 3-5 years old and each episode is educational and enjoyable with the storyline being adventurous, fun, humorous but yet simple, straightforward and non-frightening.

So, the series is toddler friendly and yes, even the character of Pete is in his good behavior and friends with Mickey Mouse and the others and also encourages the viewer to help out as well.

If you are a parent looking for a DVD that can be educational and fun for your young children and/or looking for a DVD that allows for parents and children to work together as a team, you can't go wrong with ""MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE: Mickey's Big Splash"".  Definitely give it a try!",1241568000,126,4035,4.7057142857142855

It's crazy how he interacts with it. Of note, we do not have the Mickey Mote so you do not need it in order for the show to be enjoyed. What I love most about it and he isn't stuck in front of the TV for hours- this is something I can pop in to keep him occupied while I cook dinner and then we can move on with our day. Definitely going to order more Mickey Mouse Clubhouse!",1456963200,,520,3.961904761904762

3773149,5,B001R3YRIA,"Episodes from the show ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" on the Disney Jr. Channel. Of the 3 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs we own, this one is my toddlers favorite (""Big Splash!!""). Each episode follows Mickey Mouse and friends on an overall journey that is speckled with 3 or 4 small challenges solved with the help of Toodles and his mouske-tools (everyday items that are sometimes used in obvious ways and sometimes in very creative ways). This show stretches little minds with creativity, ingenuity, and the learning basics of colors, numbers, and shapes. It's a great show with cute songs interspersed.",1424563200,5,596,5.091836734693878

3773164,5,B001R3YRIA,"This is yet another perfect addition to the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse series. In this DVD there are 4 episodes which include Donald's Ducks, Pluto's Bubble Bath, Mickey Goes Fishing, and Pete's Beach Blanket Luau. The bonus feature on this DVD is Fun In The Sun With Mickey and The Gang Game. The total approximate total running time is 96 minutes.

Don't be fooled and think that this is just about the beach. You'll go on multiple adventures which include helping Mickey get some Red Gooey fish, float with Pluto in a giant soap bubble, and help Donald rescue a lost flock of ducks. Finally it is the hottest day of the year and so Mickey and all his pals are cooling off at Star Lake where Pete is hosting a Hawaiian luau but it'll only happen if YOU help pick the right Mousketool of course!

Your child is sure to enjoy! :)",1420502400,,825,4.421052631578948
3773165,5,B001R3YRIA,"I actually purchased this a LONG time ago for my oldest child when he was little.  He was a very advanced child and really loved the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse movies.  This particular one was played several times and when the next kid was ready to watch learning shows this one quickly became a favorite for him as well.  The kids learn a lot from the movies and love shouting out which item is needed to help solve the problem.  The entire Mickey Mouse Clubhouse series is a wonderful one and if you are like me and don't have cable, then the DVDs are a great investment!",1420156800,3,569,4.339622641509434

There are four videos on this dvd, and the video is not properly formatted for widescreen TVs, and it has no way to adjust the video so that you can display it in its natural setting (standard) as opposed to being horribly stretched out for a widescreen. Additionally, it displays CC text at the bottom of the screen during episodes, even when you set it to not display subtitles. We are currently posted overseas, so its not worth my time to return this dvd, however I will never purchase another one of these dvds again, because there really is no excuse for this.

Mickey and his friends acts more like Dora (which I hate that show to), the plots are lasy written, and there's no good humor for adults on this show! It also lacks creativity on the learning part and it's very bad! Why did they ruin the mouse and his friends?! Why?!?! These are my favorite characters from my childhood and it wasn't a good idea to make a show where Mickey just talks to you on the camera oftenly! There's nothing new to the show, It's a rip-off of other shows that we've already seen before, like Dora the Exploror and the Elmo's World segments at the end of each Sesame Street episode!

3773297,3,B001R3YRIA,"I bought this for my 3 year old son who is IN LOVE with Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. I usually set up a movie for him on my old laptop while he eats dinner,and this one would not work. The disc would freeze on the FBI warning and then (if we were lucky enough to get it to run past there on the next try)glitch through the first few minutes until it completely froze again and locked up the computer itself. At first, I thought the old laptop was acting funny, so I put the disc in my brand new one. No dice, still froze. Then, as a last ditch effort, we put it on the big t.v. and it works. My husband read the back of the case and found a warning ""Not all specifications apply to all elements...Some players may not be able to access all features"". This problem worries me because of my original hope of playing it on a portable dvd player on long car trips, which was one of the reasons I was so excited about it.

Now that we have the disc playing, my son is thrilled. I was just not prepared for the strict format, when dvd's now are usually made with the capability to be played on a laptop or on portable devices. So, the movie is great, but the technological capability is definitely lacking.",1343865600,3,1195,4.150862068965517

A couple of the episodes have Pete in them and although I tend to enjoy Pete as a character, my two and a half year old is somewhat nervous/scared of him.  Pete's voice and size are intimidating for him?  I am not sure.  I might wait to show it to him again as he now tends to get scared of ""large"" strangers.",1248566400,,580,4.171171171171171
