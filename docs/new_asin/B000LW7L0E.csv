8164731,5,B000LW7L0E,"I'm watching this set for the second time now, and I've finally figured it out. The narrator is reading/making a translation of a text by Antonio Paolucci, currently the curator at the Vatican.  The narrator on the first several discs declaims quite passionately, often in very literal translations from the italian that can be quite surprising, and inevitably charming, as these are phrases very native to the Italian speaker, but not conventional for English. The effect is a marvelous shower of love on these objects, so we were disappointed when a less passionate narrator took over mid-set.  But still, the art of these treasure houses, in abbeys and sacristies outside of the major cities, is quite astonishing. And the photography is wonderful. The set is a treasure itself, and you would have travel many months in Tuscany to see all this art.",1414454400,,851,4.985915492957746
8164732,5,B000LW7L0E,"I have fallen in love with this CD set.  The beautiful Tuscan scenes, the art of the Roman Catholic church reaching back as far as the 12th Century, and the informative narrative make these CDs peaceful and yet intriguing.  I rarely purchase videos, because viewing them once is enough. But I know I will continue to enjoy this set over and over.  There is one big disappointment.  There are no programs notes with the CD.",1401321600,,422,4.586666666666667

8164735,5,B000LW7L0E,great set  If you have travelled Italy and seen a lot of their art you will realize you need to back because this set shows you all that you missed and its filmed beautifully.  The commentation is a education in itself,1295827200,2,218,4.2926829268292686
8164736,4,B000LW7L0E,"This series of dvds does a very good job of interesting and introducing the viewer to artworks and their locations that they might not have considered visiting in person.  It hits very few of the usual suspects, like the Uffizi, in favor of out of the way sites with underrated works of art.  There is also a sincere focus on early Renaissance artwork and even medieval works of art.",1220400000,5,383,4.536231884057971
8164737,5,B000LW7L0E,"This set is wonderful - a grand tour through the art of Tuscany in churches and museums that one would wish there were time to visit during a trip to Italy.  No talking heads or pompous ""experts"".  Just the art with an intelligent off-camera narration.  And what art!  Great for those who are planning a trip to Tuscany as well as those who can't get there in person.",1183420800,19,367,4.352941176470588
