8697551,4,B00S80X0JM,"Agatha Raisin The Quiche of Death is a made for British TV movie which aired in 2014, based Marion Chesney's (under her pen name M C Beaton)'s 1992 novel of the same name which is the first of 29 novels (so far at the time of this review) in the popular Agatha Raisin series. Obviously this TV movie rated well enough because two years later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Raisin-Series-1/dp/B01N2T38OH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Raisin - Series 1</a>&nbsp;brought 8 more of the books to the TV screen as 44 minute episodes, (note this movie goes for 90 minutes).

Agatha is obviously a parody of Mrs Marple, taking the creator of that character's first name.  She's a lot more stylish than Marple (the movie version doesn't resemble the Agatha Raisin book character in appearance) and acts well a lot less like old ladies do in Christie's novels. Both of course solve mysteries including murders each novel. Agatha at the start of the film is a very successful London PR agent, but disliked as a person by most around her, including those she works with and for, except for her best friend, a younger male work colleague.  She's decided to retire from her job to live in her dream home a cottage in a small rural English town.  But her expectations of how locals should behave doesn't endure her to them, such as honking at some elderly people crossing the road in the town square, and paying double to poach her neighbour's cleaner to clean her house instead because she doesn't know how to find someone else. (This would have made more sense in the mid nineties but the internet was well and truly around in 2014). Except for an Asian cop in his thirties, who has become obessed with her, changing his internet dating profile to now instead of saying 20-30, for the age range he's interested in, it now is Agatha's age range of 40-50. He tells her she needs to embrace the local communities interests to win them over.  So Agatha decides to enter an upcoming annual quiche baking contest, but of course isn't going to bother cooking it herself, but still expects to win. Unfortunately when the first corpse that has ever turned up in this town where the local police are disappointed they've never had a murder, has something to do with her quiche.  Now the whole town hates her, but she is advised by her best friend whose come to visit, that if she were to solve the murder, the town would likely love her.  So she decides to do just that, no matter who she offends on the way to achieving that goal.

The movie is fun.  It's not exactly a realistic behaviour of characters movie, but it's not pretending to be, they're most more fun versions.  The police for example don't act like real police, speeding with sirens on to interview a suspect for example.  Although Agatha is an unlikable character to most around her in the film, but she's quite likable for the viewer watching her, as we obviously see her when she's not doing the selfish things that alienate her from others.  It's obvious who the murder victim is going to be early on (it doesn't happen until half way through the movie at the 45 minute mark) simply because there's obviously going to be so many suspects for this person.  There's a lot of humour throughout, some great lines, such as her response to a wife beater threatening her with ""Back off or else!"" It's not the greatest movie ever made by any means, but you can see why it spawned a spin off TV series.

There's also plenty of extras on the region 4 DVD (note Amazon has combined a few regions reviews together) which where Ashley Jensen who plays Agatha talks to the camera, as do other cast members and crew about the show, their characters and things like this.",1522540800,,3756,4.7145038167938935
