2946220,5,B000VNMMY8,"We love this DVD set.  My son is five years old and really good at basketball.  He watches the drills and ball handling parts of the DVDs and practices them any time he is playing.  Eventually, we will be able to make more use of the second DVD, which is about game play when he is older.  The pace is good for young kids and older kids.  Steve Nash is personable and makes a good coach.  He is my son's new hero...besides his Dad (of course).",1236643200,3,443,4.093023255813954
2946221,4,B000VNMMY8,"While watching this, it became apparent that I am not exactly the target market for this product.  This is a great video for someone trying to COACH a team, as it is a great collection of individual and team DRILLS and the thinking behind them.  It also demonstrates the execution of each drill, which is helpful to see how someone who isn't Steve Nash looks performing them, and how to ""see the floor"" as a coach leading these drills.

However, this is not my case.  I'm a pickup player looking for ways to improve my game in a pickup environment.  I am not in a position to run team drills, give advice, or assume that my fellow players are actively working on the same things as I am.  So while many of the individual drills can be helpful, I'd rather dispense with the non-Nash demonstration half and get more of his tidbits.

To some extent, Nash touches on a lot of useful stuff.  For example, when talking about defense, he explains the reason you slide step on defense is that if you cross over, the offensive player will cut back on you and you can't react.  Really?  I'd like to exploit someone like that.  I'd prefer the time be spent on showing me what that looks like rather than watching some kids do figure 8 dribbling drills.

Nash does cover a lot of ground.  I don't know of another single or double disc set covering so many parts of the game this well.  But if I had a session with Steve Nash, I'd like a lot more tips on how what to look for when I'm looking for an open man, or how to position myself to have the most options and the best vision.",1233360000,11,1568,4.271186440677966
2946222,5,B000VNMMY8,My 10 yr old son loved this DVD.  The drills are well explained & easy to follow.  I'm glad I purchased this for him!,1231459200,,117,3.8333333333333335
2946223,5,B000VNMMY8,"This is a very good video for teaching youths the fundamentals of basketball. My daughter, who is 8, started basketball this fall. I was looking for books and DVDs to help her with her skills. This DVD provided exactly what was needed. Steve Nash demonstrates the skills so you see the skill perfectly demonstrated, then you see kids performing the same skills. Highly recommended.",1229817600,,381,4.96875
2946224,5,B000VNMMY8,"Really fantastic video. I knew Nash is good but I had a hard time getting the video as I live in Singapore. I had to get someone in America to buy it for me then send it down to me. All in all, it nearly cost me S$75. But I think it's worth every cent that I paid. Thanks Steve Nash for creating a video that helped my game improved tremendously. He is truly my biggest idol.",1227916800,,375,3.883116883116883
2946225,5,B000VNMMY8,"These are the best basketball instructional videos out there.  I'm a rec league coach for middle school aged kids (6th, 7th, 8th graders) and I too have watched a lot of these.  The production qualities of other videos are generally a crap shoot with spotty audio or limited camera angles.  This series has great production value and flows well.  Sometimes instructional videos focus only on individual play and not enough team, or vice versa.  There is a great balance here.  Often times the instructors speak over the target audience's heads.  Nash's style crosses the spectrum.  He doesn't condescend when focusing on basic fundamentals and doesn't confuse when taking on more nuanced aspects. Nash is a great communicator.  It's important to emphasize this.  Often times my 6th and 7th graders have a hard time sitting through these things but throughout this series (taken in reasonable time chunks) they were engaged and interested.  The kids that participate in the taped sessions range in age from middle school to high school and he puts them through several great drills.  The transition from offense to defense to offense are especially helpful and I will be using a several of the drills presented during our upcoming season.

Coaches, and players, this is a must.  Save your money and check these out before you spring potentially more dough for less informative and entertaining series.",1223164800,28,1400,5.083333333333333
2946226,5,B000VNMMY8,Who better to talk about fundamentals.  This DVD is clear and well organized and Steve's commitment to practice comes right through.,1212883200,7,132,5.285714285714286
2946227,5,B000VNMMY8,"Several years ago I got four or five used instructional soccer videos for my kids. They varied widely in quality, but all had something constructive to offer. Using those videos as a basis for comparison, there is no comparison: all the basketball fundamentals are here in one DVD, presented in a way that is totally engaging. It's difficult to explain, but Steve Nash conveys such a great attitude- kind of a mixture of humility, enthusiasm, and hard work- that anyone involved in any competitive sport or endeavor could benefit from watching it. It's easy to understand how he got to be the league MVP, with the excellent mindset he has. This DVD seems to have been a labor of love on his part. As a final note, sports videos all seem to have cheesy distracting background music, but the riffs here really add to the overall effect. Thank you Steve Nash. My kids have benefited in many ways from your efforts.",1211673600,35,911,4.6645962732919255
2946228,5,B000VNMMY8,"Let me start by saying I've watched quite a few Basketball videos and Ive coached Jr. High and Rec Basketball so my knowledge going in is fair.
Nash being one of the greats of all time has done a great job with all the basic fundementals, he also teaches drills to improve individual and team play. In the second video which I found really helpful he goes over Defense to Offense transition, Defense, Offense to Defense transition and Offense. Going over some basic zone and man to man defenses and offenses with the aide of another really good high school coach.  Nash is really good as the Host, doesn't bore you, he's energetic and the kids he uses to instruct the viewer are kids we are likely to see at different levels we would coach.  Best video by far that Ive seen or purchased. With the low price point of this video it makes it a must buy, have fun.",1202860800,68,860,4.36875

2946237,5,B000VNMMY8,"This is a great video if you are beginning coaching and need a quick introduction to useful drills and basic concepts of playing good Bball. I do agree with the other reviewers in that this video is geared more towards the coach and not the player. Everything is taught from the perspective of the coach and not the player - which we all know are two different universes.

I am coaching 5/6th grade for the first time and thought I understood the game but ran into issues very quickly trying to teach it. This has been a big help getting the team to understand basic concepts and planting ""seeds"" that can be used right away on the court. I found the 2nd. Disk to be the most useful in running practices with the team and how to structure a practice. Steve and the Coach do a great job explaining and showing really important things like Man-2-Man and Zone defenses. There are a lot of really good offensive drills shown as well. I also liked the fact that they left bloopers in. They will often stop the kids and show what they did wrong and have them do it again. The first disk had drills that were pretty standard like anything you would find on youtube but worth a watch.

No if I could only get my kids to pay attention like Steve's...",1392076800,,1241,4.344827586206897
2946238,5,B000VNMMY8,Very informative. Clear and precise instructions. I've actually incorporated some of the drills as well as play sets into my program.,1391472000,,133,5.380952380952381
2946239,4,B000VNMMY8,Was good information on  dribbling drills but much like the old pistol Pete videos.  I thought the team dvd was the better of the 2 DVDs but the drills do work just nothing that was really new,1388620800,,192,4.162162162162162

2946242,5,B000VNMMY8,I ordered this dvd to help my two girls practice and so that I could understand what it is my husband is teaching them in basketball. Steve Nash is not only a great player but he is explains the drills so that a laymen like me can use to teach. Great video,1369699200,,256,3.9423076923076925

2946244,2,B000VNMMY8,I was disappointed when I final received the video and watched. Its very basic. You can find the same drills and exercises on YouTube. It was a waste of $19.00. I don't recommend it for serious ballers.,1366761600,,202,4.486486486486487
2946245,4,B000VNMMY8,"This is a great dvd for anyone who is new at coaching or looking to be a more fundamentally sound bball player, mostly basic though and not alot of game strategy.",1365638400,,162,4.258064516129032
2946246,5,B000VNMMY8,My boys have learned so much from Steve Nash.  Their game has improved 10 fold!  Highly recommend for the family.,1364515200,,113,4.6
2946247,5,B000VNMMY8,"My son lives and breathes basketball (he's 11) and craves coaching. I co-coach his Rec League team. I searched carefully for a Fundamentals guide, in any media, and settled on this DVD. In short, it's great, wholly satisfied. Well produced, flows nicely, and most importantly, is loaded with info, ranging from simple individual drills, to more complex team drills.

Contains enough info to incorporate in to a full SEASON of coaching youth basketball. My son even jokingly refers to Steve Nash as his coach, when he sees him on TV.",1361491200,2,532,4.911111111111111
2946248,5,B000VNMMY8,"If you are only buying one, make it the Steve Nash's DVDs.  Pete Marovich's is also good.  As a former high school coach in Ohio and Kentucky, I find Pistol  Pete's DVD to be good, Lenny Wilkins' DVD to be fair, but Steve Nash's the best I've seen.",1360713600,,248,4.125
2946249,4,B000VNMMY8,Great DVD. It helped my improve my game as I have only a little of the fundamentals. Now I can play ball at the gym and not make a compete fool of myself.,1358899200,,154,3.696969696969697

2946251,1,B000VNMMY8,"I will try to be as short as I can with this review, so you don't waste your time on reading it, or yours money on this Nash's ""fundamentals"" video. Also English isn't my first language, so except my apologies!
First if you have basketball skills grater then 3 on scale of 10, then this 2 DVDs won't teach you anything. And if your are total beginner then you will have problem to pick those fundamentals correctly, cause nor dribbling, nor passing, nor shooting, nor anything in this video won't be covered not only in depth, it won't even be covered half-decently. This will be even more difficult for kids, cause they certainly won't analyse video over and over again watching Steve Nash's move in slow motion trying to figure it out what are all the things they need to pay attention.
I will make my case on one example: crossover- it is a simple change of a direction of your movement along with changing a hand with which you are dribbling the basketball. Steve Nash will show that once, and then bunch of a kids will try to repeat this.  But what is a right footwork? What leg should go first if you are driving right, what if you are driving left? What will sell your fake? Where you should look with your eyes, should you pay special attention to some body movement in order to sell that fake...? When you are changing direction should your foot touch the flore first with foot-heel or fingers (in order to be more explosive)? All those details are not in this DVD. And as a result of that your kid (cause only kid could watch this) will learn FUNDAMENTALS WRONG!!!
It is one thing to try to do a crossover, and it is whole other thing to do it correctly!!!!!!! Same thing is applied for SHOOTING, PASSING...

Save your money and spend a 1 hour on YouTube, you will find much better free videos which are far better and more informative than this 2 DVDs!",1353196800,3,1863,4.428571428571429
2946252,5,B000VNMMY8,"My son who is now 9 years old started watching this when he was 5 years old.  At that time, he can barely pounce on a 28.5"" ball and he had a hard time doing the pete maravich drills, but through persistence this has developed his eye hand coordination and now at 9 years old, he has always been the best ball handler in his team.  I myself loved these set of 2 DVDs especially the 2nd one as it will teach you how to coach a team.  Not only that but Steve Nash is a great communicator and never boring in this DVD.",1351987200,,515,3.9326923076923075
2946253,5,B000VNMMY8,"My son has found this DVD to be very informative (12 year old).  My husband, who coaches, also is finding this to be helpful in designing drills that have real value for the players of this age.  I think for older kids there is still a lot that can be useful in this DVD.  Great product.",1332547200,,287,4.089285714285714
2946254,5,B000VNMMY8,"This two DVD video covers basic basketball from A to Z.  My sports inclined grand-daughter learned so much from this program that she is now in an all year basketball club.  While still a beginner, this video gave her a head start and she is now matching the other girls her age who having been playing for several years. It begins with the basic basketball skills and drills.  It then works up to basic defense and offense.  It shows Steve Nash showing the drills to young boys and girls with them then doing the same thing.  The kids make mistakes but help reinforce the need to practice. GREAT VIDEO FOR THE BEGINNER BASKETBALL PLAYER.",1324857600,,638,4.56140350877193
2946255,5,B000VNMMY8,"My ten year old son likes watching basketball and playing it thru the local rec league.  I personally cannot give him hints as to how to better his skills because I never played basketball so I got this DVD thinking what can I lose.  Well, I watched this with him and was amazed at the everything that was done.  They start out with basic shooting form like how to hold the ball, what your hand is supposed to do when it releases the ball(drop down into a cookie jar!) and how to tell (by wrapping masking tape around the ball) if you have put the correct spin on the ball when its released.  After watching this, with no prompting from me, my son immediately goes to the court to start doing the stuff!  Unbelievable.  I lent these discs to a friend who has a similar age son and he said his kid also went outside and started practicing on his own.  For some reason this disc really inspires and I think its in large part that all the material is in a form that is easily digestable.  My son is a better BBall player now and I think the fundamentals portion of this really helped him identify what he should be doing.  Alot of kids just start shooting with a form that feels comfortable to them, even if it is wrong, and I think many would benefit it they saw this video.  This package also contains alot of team drills which looked good.",1318896000,2,1339,4.256916996047431
2946256,3,B000VNMMY8,"I watched this dvd with my two sons ages 14 and 21 after the younger one announced he wanted to concentrate on getting better at basketball during the off season. They liked it, but they watched it the one time and not again so far. They were impressed it was made by Steve Nash. They prefer to be out on the court playing or getting direct instruction or drill rather than watching a dvd. This may be better suited for a coach or a parent looking for tips to help younger players.",1301011200,3,481,4.239130434782608

2946258,4,B000VNMMY8,This DVD is highly recommended to all new and current coaches who would like to start with the basics and inhance further development with thier players. I have used some of the training tips and the kids love it. Using this DVD makes training Fun and enjoyable and it enables the kids to develop thier skills. Thanks Steve Nash for giving the world a chance to learn and develop basketball skills. More professional basketball players should follow suite.,1297296000,,456,4.858974358974359
2946259,3,B000VNMMY8,"I bought this for my 14 year old son, who is always looking to improve his game, and Nash is definitely an incredible player with an interesting Canadian family background that should be included in some part of the video.  Clips from some of his games would also help because he is smaller than a lot of the players in the NBA, and it shows that with a lot of hard work and determination, a kid can improve his game.  Nash is better than a lot of these taller guys, which proves that height isn't everything in basketball.  His stats are incredible.  Therefore, more about Nash in his DVD set would be more motivational for the young player.",1295136000,,642,4.415254237288136

2946262,5,B000VNMMY8,"This DVD set is an excellent choice for youth and Middle School basketball coaches. I coach 7th grade girls and found almost all of the drills to be applicable to them. Nash is good as the host, but I think the best part is the second DVD and the AAU coach who presents many of the team drills and concepts. This is a very well produced DVD set.",1268870400,,345,4.088235294117647
2946263,5,B000VNMMY8,"Steve Nash flies through drills to give youth the foundations for good technique and a broad concept of excellent basketball fundamentals. As a youth coach, I learned a thing or two also. I will use many (if not all) of the drills Steve Nash demonstrated for years to come. I would say, this is for youth pre-teen to 15 years of age. If you are serious about coaching youth or you have a son or daughter who wishes to advance their game, buy this two DVD series and learned from a seasoned athlete who knows what works and what doesn't! Highly recommended.",1254787200,2,556,4.46078431372549

2946265,5,B000VNMMY8,"I ordered this DVD for my 11 year old son hoping he could gain some techniques, practice drills and some overall basketball knowledge from the great Steve Nash. This DVD definitely delivers.

It is broken down into two videos....the first featuring Steve Nash. He teaches the basics of ball handling, shooting & defense offering great drills for youths to practice. The second video features a seven time AAU champion basketball coach on how to properly run basketball practices. Both of these videos are well produced and offer wonderful tips and techniques as if you were at one of Steve's clinics....only better since you can watch these DVDs over & over to absorb the content at your own pace.

As a 2 time MVP, I can't think of anyone better to offer advise than the incomparable Steve Nash. A must have for your basketball collection.",1251763200,,840,4.826388888888889
2946266,2,B000VNMMY8,"This instructional set probably has the most value if you are interested in coaching or teaching the game to youngsters.  If you are looking for some tips to improve your game, you may want to save your money, as there may not be too much to be gained from this two DVD set, from two time NBA MVP Steve Nash.

Disc One covers tips and drills for improving individual skills, and Disc Two covers team offensive and defensive concepts.  Featuring boys and girls from about age eight to twelve executing the drills, these DVD's seems to be aimed at those who work with kids, or coach youth basketball.  The marketing for this item however is misleading, and doesn't even mention that kids are involved.  This description is taken from the back cover of the DVD, `MVP Steve Nash teaches the fundamentals of basketball in his step by step program designed to give every basketball player a competitive edge on the court'.  Assuming `every player' includes the NBA, if an NBA level player can really benefit from watching kids doing these drills, that player probably has some major problems with fundamentals.

Disc One is all of 42 minutes long, and covers ball handling (17 Minutes), shooting (15 minutes), passing (5 minutes), and defense (5 minutes).  The thoroughness of the instruction varies, but is generally rather minimal and cursory.  For a player with basic skills looking to improve their game, watching kids perform drills, probably won't put you in the ideal frame of mind to improve your game.  Nash usually focuses on the topic at hand, and covers what he intends to, however the lack of depth makes real improvement rather questionable.  Shooting in particular, could have received much more attention.  The elementary school atmosphere is probably fine for kids, but it may be hard for an adult to take seriously.  There isn't a lot of coaching or correction, mostly constant encouragement from Nash, which gets old fast.

The second disk covers team concepts for offense and defense, and Nash gives way to Roch Weilbaecher an AAU coach who runs the drills and provides instruction.  At times Nash disappears, while the kids run drills.  Is this what people thought they were buying?  If you coach a team the drills may be useful.  If not, then watching 80 minutes of drills could get boring.

What would have been cool, is Nash imparting his insights regarding the things that he actually does during a game, against NBA competition.  Granted, much of Nash's play is spontaneous and instinctive, but there is still much that he could have revealed about his game, and the basketball in general.  There's nothing wrong with making a video aimed at youngsters, but not being straight with people about what the product actually is, and who is the target market, is disingenuous and reprehensible.  To be clear, the youngsters are not to blame for anything, they are only following directions.  Maybe Steve Nash just wanted to be the tallest one on the court, but he doesn't stand very tall here.

They cost more, but if you are interested in personal improvement rather than learning how to coach others, take a look at the series of videos from Betterbasketball.com.",1247011200,10,3180,4.878957169459963

2946268,4,B000VNMMY8,Steve Nash does a great job on presenting coaches and players a progressive mindset for building their fundamental basketball skills.

For example, when talking about defense, he explains the reason you slide step on defense is that if you cross over, the offensive player will cut back on you and you can't react.  Really?  I'd like to exploit someone like that.  I'd prefer the time be spent on showing me what that looks like rather than watching some kids do figure 8 dribbling drills.

Nash does cover a lot of ground.  I don't know of another single or double disc set covering so many parts of the game this well.  But if I had a session with Steve Nash, I'd like a lot more tips on how what to look for when I'm looking for an open man, or how to position myself to have the most options and the best vision.",1233360000,11,1568,4.271186440677966

I had to get someone in America to buy it for me then send it down to me. All in all, it nearly cost me S$75. But I think it's worth every cent that I paid. Thanks Steve Nash for creating a video that helped my game improved tremendously. He is truly my biggest idol.",1227916800,,375,3.883116883116883
3180722,5,B000VNMMY8,"These are the best basketball instructional videos out there.  I'm a rec league coach for middle school aged kids (6th, 7th, 8th graders) and I too have watched a lot of these.  The production qualities of other videos are generally a crap shoot with spotty audio or limited camera angles.  This series has great production value and flows well.  Sometimes instructional videos focus only on individual play and not enough team, or vice versa.  There is a great balance here.  Often times the instructors speak over the target audience's heads.  Nash's style crosses the spectrum.  He doesn't condescend when focusing on basic fundamentals and doesn't confuse when taking on more nuanced aspects. Nash is a great communicator.  It's important to emphasize this.  Often times my 6th and 7th graders have a hard time sitting through these things but throughout this series (taken in reasonable time chunks) they were engaged and interested.  The kids that participate in the taped sessions range in age from middle school to high school and he puts them through several great drills.  The transition from offense to defense to offense are especially helpful and I will be using a several of the drills presented during our upcoming season.

Coaches, and players, this is a must.  Save your money and check these out before you spring potentially more dough for less informative and entertaining series.",1223164800,28,1400,5.083333333333333

3180724,5,B000VNMMY8,"Several years ago I got four or five used instructional soccer videos for my kids. They varied widely in quality, but all had something constructive to offer. Using those videos as a basis for comparison, there is no comparison: all the basketball fundamentals are here in one DVD, presented in a way that is totally engaging. It's difficult to explain, but Steve Nash conveys such a great attitude- kind of a mixture of humility, enthusiasm, and hard work- that anyone involved in any competitive sport or endeavor could benefit from watching it. It's easy to understand how he got to be the league MVP, with the excellent mindset he has. This DVD seems to have been a labor of love on his part. As a final note, sports videos all seem to have cheesy distracting background music, but the riffs here really add to the overall effect. Thank you Steve Nash.

Nash being one of the greats of all time has done a great job with all the basic fundementals, he also teaches drills to improve individual and team play. In the second video which I found really helpful he goes over Defense to Offense transition, Defense, Offense to Defense transition and Offense. Going over some basic zone and man to man defenses and offenses with the aide of another really good high school coach.  Nash is really good as the Host, doesn't bore you, he's energetic and the kids he uses to instruct the viewer are kids we are likely to see at different levels we would coach.

3180734,5,B000VNMMY8,"This is a great video if you are beginning coaching and need a quick introduction to useful drills and basic concepts of playing good Bball. I do agree with the other reviewers in that this video is geared more towards the coach and not the player. Everything is taught from the perspective of the coach and not the player - which we all know are two different universes.

I am coaching 5/6th grade for the first time and thought I understood the game but ran into issues very quickly trying to teach it. This has been a big help getting the team to understand basic concepts and planting ""seeds"" that can be used right away on the court. I found the 2nd. Disk to be the most useful in running practices with the team and how to structure a practice. Steve and the Coach do a great job explaining and showing really important things like Man-2-Man and Zone defenses. There are a lot of really good offensive drills shown as well. I also liked the fact that they left bloopers in. They will often stop the kids and show what they did wrong and have them do it again. The first disk had drills that were pretty standard like anything you would find on youtube but worth a watch.

First if you have basketball skills grater then 3 on scale of 10, then this 2 DVDs won't teach you anything. And if your are total beginner then you will have problem to pick those fundamentals correctly, cause nor dribbling, nor passing, nor shooting, nor anything in this video won't be covered not only in depth, it won't even be covered half-decently. This will be even more difficult for kids, cause they certainly won't analyse video over and over again watching Steve Nash's move in slow motion trying to figure it out what are all the things they need to pay attention.
I will make my case on one example: crossover- it is a simple change of a direction of your movement along with changing a hand with which you are dribbling the basketball. Steve Nash will show that once, and then bunch of a kids will try to repeat this.  But what is a right footwork? What leg should go first if you are driving right, what if you are driving left? What will sell your fake? Where you should look with your eyes, should you pay special attention to some body movement in order to sell that fake...? When you are changing direction should your foot touch the flore first with foot-heel or fingers (in order to be more explosive)? All those details are not in this DVD. And as a result of that your kid (cause only kid could watch this) will learn FUNDAMENTALS WRONG!!!
It is one thing to try to do a crossover, and it is whole other thing to do it correctly!!!!!!! Same thing is applied for SHOOTING, PASSING...

Save your money and spend a 1 hour on YouTube, you will find much better free videos which are far better and more informative than this 2 DVDs!",1353196800,3,1863,4.428571428571429

I personally cannot give him hints as to how to better his skills because I never played basketball so I got this DVD thinking what can I lose.  Well, I watched this with him and was amazed at the everything that was done.  They start out with basic shooting form like how to hold the ball, what your hand is supposed to do when it releases the ball(drop down into a cookie jar!) and how to tell (by wrapping masking tape around the ball) if you have put the correct spin on the ball when its released.  After watching this, with no prompting from me, my son immediately goes to the court to start doing the stuff!  Unbelievable.  I lent these discs to a friend who has a similar age son and he said his kid also went outside and started practicing on his own.  For some reason this disc really inspires and I think its in large part that all the material is in a form that is easily digestable.  My son is a better BBall player now and I think the fundamentals portion of this really helped him identify what he should be doing.  Alot of kids just start shooting with a form that feels comfortable to them, even if it is wrong, and I think many would benefit it they saw this video.

Clips from some of his games would also help because he is smaller than a lot of the players in the NBA, and it shows that with a lot of hard work and determination, a kid can improve his game.

The second video features a seven time AAU champion basketball coach on how to properly run basketball practices. Both of these videos are well produced and offer wonderful tips and techniques as if you were at one of Steve's clinics....only better since you can watch these DVDs over & over to absorb the content at your own pace.

3180763,2,B000VNMMY8,"This instructional set probably has the most value if you are interested in coaching or teaching the game to youngsters.  If you are looking for some tips to improve your game, you may want to save your money, as there may not be too much to be gained from this two DVD set, from two time NBA MVP Steve Nash.

Disc One covers tips and drills for improving individual skills, and Disc Two covers team offensive and defensive concepts.  Featuring boys and girls from about age eight to twelve executing the drills, these DVD's seems to be aimed at those who work with kids, or coach youth basketball.  The marketing for this item however is misleading, and doesn't even mention that kids are involved.  This description is taken from the back cover of the DVD, `MVP Steve Nash teaches the fundamentals of basketball in his step by step program designed to give every basketball player a competitive edge on the court'.  Assuming `every player' includes the NBA, if an NBA level player can really benefit from watching kids doing these drills, that player probably has some major problems with fundamentals.

Disc One is all of 42 minutes long, and covers ball handling (17 Minutes), shooting (15 minutes), passing (5 minutes), and defense (5 minutes).  The thoroughness of the instruction varies, but is generally rather minimal and cursory.  For a player with basic skills looking to improve their game, watching kids perform drills, probably won't put you in the ideal frame of mind to improve your game.  Nash usually focuses on the topic at hand, and covers what he intends to, however the lack of depth makes real improvement rather questionable.  Shooting in particular, could have received much more attention.  The elementary school atmosphere is probably fine for kids, but it may be hard for an adult to take seriously.  There isn't a lot of coaching or correction, mostly constant encouragement from Nash, which gets old fast.

The second disk covers team concepts for offense and defense, and Nash gives way to Roch Weilbaecher an AAU coach who runs the drills and provides instruction.  At times Nash disappears, while the kids run drills.  Is this what people thought they were buying?  If you coach a team the drills may be useful.  If not, then watching 80 minutes of drills could get boring.

What would have been cool, is Nash imparting his insights regarding the things that he actually does during a game, against NBA competition.  Granted, much of Nash's play is spontaneous and instinctive, but there is still much that he could have revealed about his game, and the basketball in general.  There's nothing wrong with making a video aimed at youngsters, but not being straight with people about what the product actually is, and who is the target market, is disingenuous and reprehensible.  To be clear, the youngsters are not to blame for anything, they are only following directions.  Maybe Steve Nash just wanted to be the tallest one on the court, but he doesn't stand very tall here.

They cost more, but if you are interested in personal improvement rather than learning how to coach others, take a look at the series of videos from Betterbasketball.com.",1247011200,10,3180,4.878957169459963
