The dance routine really gets you moving. Jaclyn was involved in ballet in her younger years, and I love that she incorporates ballet moves with the routine. It has been said that dancing is one of the best exercises you can do to stay fit. Jaclyn's makeup tips are great, too. I highly recommend this video, in spite of its age - it is timeless!  Good thing I still have my VHS player, as it is not available on DVD. Hopefully, it will be soon! ( For anyone interested in this fact: the trainer is Elizabeth Jones, as Jaclyn introduces her in the beginning of the floor workout. Today, she is Elizabeth Jones- Boswell, and is a professional Pilates teacher with a Houston- based business.)",1495670400,,859,4.424050632911392
7828982,5,6302665221,"This workout is timeless!

I've been using this video for years..  It's a gentle and effective dance/pilates style workout for someone who is a beginner or at an intermediate level.  It takes a little time to learn the steps, and proper form - so be patient.  It is soo worth it!  Jaclyn Smith and Mari Winsor are gracious and enjoyable to watch.  They remind you to protect your back and breathe.  The floor exercises and the instructor are great as well.

I took some time away from this and recently started using it again. Wish it was on dvd or blue ray.  I feel great!",1390953600,2,573,4.380952380952381
7828983,5,6302665221,"I had this workout video when it first came out in the early 90s, and unbelievably nearly 20 years later they're still selling it new (and used) here on Amazon.  I had many celebrity workout videos years ago including Raquel Welch and Jane Fonda, and have been trying to re-locate them and see which has the least strenuous yet effective exercises since I have developed serious back problems.  Finally, the answer: it's this workout video by Jaclyn Smith.  She looks like she has always been slim by nature (she started out as a model), and I appreciate that she doesn't ""kill herself"" doing hard or complicated exercises like many of the others.  All I need are some basic standing or floor calisthenics that won't aggravate my back but will tone me up, and there are many on this tape.  She has two professional instructors leading the way in each segment, and no weights or chairs are required, it's just simple and direct instructional.  The aerobic part is a low impact, no bounce Jazzercise type dance routine with some ballet moves incorporated, with a pleasant jazzy score in the background.  Good stretches are done before and after the cardio.  For the floor exercises you can use a mat or towel, and add optional bands or a medium size ball (though the trainer does not use these, showing you don't need them either).  I appreciate that the trainer always stresses keeping a neutral, non-curved spine keeping your back flat on the mat the entire time, and even the stomach crunches are modified so your back remains on the ground and you come up halfway.  Jaclyn's beauty advice segment is 5 minutes of basic quick face makeup tips, she keeps everything on this tape simple and doable.  All in all, this is a pleasant exercise tape that inspires you to get moving instead of intimidating you or making you feel bad about what you CAN'T do.",1346716800,4,1851,4.69969040247678
7828984,5,6302665221,"Would you believe I picked this video up at a thrift store for $2.00. I love it and feel so lucky to have picked this one. I love the dance routine, and to think that we have Mari Windsor as our dance instructor. This is a great workout for all.",1154649600,4,245,3.92
7828985,5,6302665221,"I have had this workout VHS for years. I loved it then right when it came out and I still come back to it and use it. It tones you and makes you look and feel lean. And if anyone has noticed it is Mari Winsor that is her instructor! I disagree with one review. I think the workout part is great- it's not hard, you do the tape a few times and you can have it memorized and then you can really get into the workout and the floor workout is also great. I got tone and lean in no time ! LOVE THIS WORKOUT and always will. If you want long and lean this is the one for YOU!",1143158400,5,569,3.7107438016528924
7828986,5,6302665221,"Jaclyn Smith of late has become one of the most successful business women in America, one factor is choosing right projects at a right time and presenting this video workout is one of those. She may not have the ""Jane Fonda"" style but this is well-presented workout video for everyone who wants to firm their bodies without building muscles.
For fans, this is a must. Jaclyn Smith never been look beautiful and sexier. Her trainers are also in top shape and the programs are excellent plus some beauty/make-up tips from the ""World's Most Beautiful Woman.""",1037318400,3,555,4.852631578947369
7828987,4,6302665221,"As the previous reviewer said the floor workout is wonderful because of it's use of Pilates. Jaclyn Smith and the instructor explain the moves well before doing them and are easy to keep up with. The leg workout is my absolute favorite. my thighs and hips have always been a problem area for me but these exercises seem to be the only ones to get them into shape, and quickly! The dance workout on the other hand is HORRIBLE. The instructor goes from move to move as if the viewer is a mind reader. Her directions are not clear at all, she jumps into the next step and explains in vague terms. It's good to get your heart rate up, by confusing the heck out of you. It's not difficult choreography but since there's no instruction you're left standing there moving your arms around like a fool.",984268800,8,793,4.401360544217687
7828988,4,6302665221,"ms. smith brings a nice soft calf. approach to this work out. the mood of this video is slow, but healthly. she takes a ""long and lean"" target view, the low-impact dance is o.k. but the floor work i found to be  the best because it uses Pilates. the cool down is very good. she moves you  through the workout,and before you know it, its over. its a good one for  the people who don't want to jump around.",942105600,7,404,4.0886075949367084
