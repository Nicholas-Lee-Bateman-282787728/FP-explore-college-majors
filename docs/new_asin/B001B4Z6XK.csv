It turned out that there are a couple of scary looking 'bad guys' in every story.  My little one got scared and we stopped watching the DVD.  I guess I will wait till she is older to try this DVD again.  I enjoyed the stories; each have a good moral behind it.  Overall, I would recommend this to Calico Critter funs that are over 5 years old.",1309392000,3,450,4.126436781609195
8281946,4,B001B4Z6XK,"My daughter recently discovered Calico Critters.  Since their web site is a bit lame, I went to Wikipedia and discovered that outside of the USA, the brand is called Sylvanian Families.  When I added this film to out Netflix queue it wasn't available for quick shipping.  When I checked Amazon I found this price, and Prime shipping, I decided that owning it would be better.

The Stories are VERY simple, and the plot is hit you in the forehead obvious.  Bu the animation reminds me of the 80 cartoons I used to watch, and it is a true joy to watch my children enjoying them.  I found nothing objectionable in the content, and when we reached the end of the 7th episode I told them too bad their over.  My daughters response, ""But daddy, we can watch them all over again""

When I tucked them in, she told me she was wishing of going to he Sylvanian Forest in her dreams.",1289692800,4,871,4.366459627329193
