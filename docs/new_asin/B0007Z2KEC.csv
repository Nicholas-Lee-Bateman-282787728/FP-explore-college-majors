2253933,1,B0007Z2KEC,"I bought this at a 99 store and it was a total waste, since I already have it on VHS, and Family home entertainment made their VHS copy from a much better print.  This has a lot of missing shots, terrible sound, murky color, green scratches down the entire picture, and I couldn't bring myself to give the rest of the dic a try.  VHS has never looked so good as when I did a direct comparison to my VHS copy.  I'm not sure FHE is still around, but their VHS edition was as beautiful as VHS comes, and, though competently authored with minimal artifacting, this source material makes it unacceptable.  Some of this might actually be deliberate, since all the voice credits were deleted.",1122336000,12,685,4.456
2253934,3,B0007Z2KEC,"This was the first Japanese color animated feature film to be released from Japan.  It was released in Japan in 1958 and distributed in the US in 1961, before Alakazam the Great.

It's a wierd little movie with a lot of interesting sequences, if not an overwhelmingly interesting plot.  It's interesting to see work from Japan before the influence of Osamu Tezuka's animated productions, and the influence of modern American animation techniques.

This edition of the DVD is a frequent denizen of dollar bins along with other inexpensive public domain cartoons.  The price is its most obvious advantage, if you're paying more than five dollars for this, you're paying too much.

On the downside, this is very obviously a direct film to DVD transfer from what in spots looks to be a very weathered print (particularly the opening).  Aside from that the dub is atrocious and worse than many kung-fu films I've seen (if you can believe that).  In many places the dub quits entierly and reverts to the original Japanese language dialogue in many spots--it seems only key lines of dialogue were dubbed and the rest was left as-is.

Considering this and the woeful American editing this supposedly has, it would be nice to see this film done in a restored and professionally re-dubbed version, which would be a fine tribute to a strong classic.  Until then, this low-priced edition is at least adequate.",1115856000,3,1397,4.906382978723404

2253936,5,B0007Z2KEC,"As a child, I talked my mom into taking me back to see it again three times, and she talked the theatre into letting us set up a bulky old real-to-real tape recorder and take 35mm photos of the movie.  The love story was increadibly deep and magical for me, emotion beyond words.",1089936000,5,279,4.264150943396227

You can tell it was originally in Mandarin/Cantonese, but don't worry it is in english for those of us not fluent in Chinese (except for the beautiful songs, which are translated by the narrator). Also, it is a copy of the original film, which at times is visible but I think that is neat!",1486425600,,306,4.385964912280702

In long ago (Song Dynasty) China a young boy is forced to give up a beloved white snake pet.  After he grows up said snake is transformed into a beautiful girl who seeks him out, but the lovers are separated by a misguided priest who believes that all spirits are evil.  Can love triumph over all?  Perhaps, but it will take the efforts of several cute talking animals.

The only nit I can pick is that unlike what Discotek Media did on their versions of three long lost TOEI family classics:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>, Schrder Media did not offer the English dubbing as an additional audio track so that you could listen to it as you watch the pristine film print.",1452038400,2,2617,9.15953307392996

I couldn't for the life of me remember the title, and after a night of drunken googling that may make the NSA question my actions, I found it. 4 days after ordering this, I have it in my hands. I'm giddy. I'm amazed. I'm afraid to watch it in case it doesn't luv up to the expectations I have that were set when I was 6 years old. I'm going to keep talking to my friend Jack and see if he can convince me to take the leap.",1439164800,,506,3.7383177570093458

8054486,4,B0007Z2KEC,"Hakuja Den (Kazuhiko Okabe and Taiji Yabushita, 1958)

Super-cute fifties anime (did the term ""anime"" even exist back in '58? I don't actually know the answer to that question), released in English-speaking countries as Panda and the Magic Serpent and based on a Chinese legend. Other reviewers have (quite reasonably) commented that Toei were definitely influenced by early Disney when creating this film, but I have seen far less speculation that Ghibli were influenced by this, which seems quite evident; there were at least five or six sequences in here where I thought to myself, ""Miyazaki had this in mind when crafting a scene in Kiki's Delivery Service!"" or ""look at that scene design, if Takahata didn't grab that I'll be a panda's uncle"" or the like.

I can only give you the barest overview of the plot: a seductive demon woos a musician, falls in love with him, and when her ministrations lead to his eventual demise, she is faced with a choice: give up her status as an immortal in order to bring him back, or remain as she is? There's a great deal more to it than that, and I'm sure that being familiar with the legend upon which the film is based would have given me a lot more to go on, but as someone who was coming into it cold, I can tell you that not quite grasping all the nuances of how you get from point A to point B (for example, why did the thief-animals suddenly switch sides and decide to ally with Panda? I still don't get that) will not stop you from enjoying the heck out of this flick. Find the subtitled version; I have no idea whether the English-language version changed anything but the voices, but you don't want to miss Chuji Kinoshita's exquisite music, which is germane to the story (again, main character is a musician). It's a great deal of fun, and if you're a fan of classic Disney films, but never quite got into modern anime, you owe it to yourself to check this out to see how we got from point A to point B (and hopefully gain an appreciation for the amazing works of art being turned out by Ghibli). *** 1/2",1360022400,,2056,4.450928381962865

A great example of japan cartoon.
Great color and great story. The music is very beautiful.
I recommend this movie to all collectors and lovers of animation",1343779200,,179,5.0
8054488,2,B0007Z2KEC,"The print itself is in terrible condition and there is no opening menu on the DVD.  I would not recommend either the Digiview or the East/West versions.  The English edition is missing the first five minutes of the film, which omits a major point of the story.  It's too bad, since this is a classic Japanese animated film.  Look for the Italian version instead, at least it's a better print and the full movie.

They also identified the character Mimi as a cat, but if you look closely, Mimi is actually a lesser panda.",1327104000,2,520,4.48936170212766
8054489,5,B0007Z2KEC,"I must explain that the other reviews are for the DIGIVIEW edition and not the EAST/WEST edition. I watched the EAST/WEST edition and it has none of the problems two reviewers complain about. It has the English translated Japanese credits as well as the American credits. It lists Marvin Miller as narrator, well known as the voice of Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet and for narrating the Bell Telephone Science Series as well as all six episodes of Police Squad. The color is very good and the sound is fine. The film print that the DVD was made from certainly is not pristine as there is enough ""snowy"" sections and scratches visible from time to time, but they are not anywhere near as disturbing as two other reviewers pointed out the Digiview edition is. Until some company is willing to invest $100,000 to produce a cleaned up version of this animated classic the East/West edition is the one to own.",1280361600,4,910,4.658385093167702
