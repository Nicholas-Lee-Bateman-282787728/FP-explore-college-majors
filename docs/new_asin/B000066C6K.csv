1712616,5,B000066C6K,"This DVD of Verdi's Requiem is fabulous.  Everyone of the soloists, Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Daniela Barcellona, Julian Konstantinov, were fantastic and a great blend of voices.  Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic did an outstanding job with exactly the dynamics that we desired.  Soundtrack was perfect for our surround system and the video portion as viewed on our 62"" TV made us feel like we were in the audience.  Highly recommend this DVD to any and all opera lovers.",1191456000,3,482,5.141025641025641
1712617,5,B000066C6K,"Reply to Rodney's question - the reason, according to Gramophone's review, behind Abbado's sickly appearance is because only a few weeks(?) earlier the maestro had been on his sick-bed. This lended a tremendous ethereal and fiery element to the perfomance itself. What musician wouldn't give 200% for their dying director?

It's evident from beginning to end the level of meticulous care that went into preparing this performance. Every section of the orchestra plays with typical Germanic gusto, but with a sensitivity only a native Italian can wring out of a score by a very Italian composer. As is the norm with Abbado's conducting, the melody is always at the forefront. Though there be blazing dynamics galore (especially in the Dies Irae), it merely teeters on the brink of theatrical. Some call this work 'operatic', but many will appreciate Abbado's careful approach toward the spiritual qualities in the score, allowing the religious characteristics (from an otherwise unreligious Verdi) to shine through where others might turn it into fanfare.

Here, the opportunity to showcase two excellent choirs is siezed beautifully. Ever mindful of the somber nature of this work, the singers do not merely bark the notes, but 'pray' each phrase as though their lives depended on it. The soloists are, for the most part, solid throughout. Roberto Alagna doesn't have the great lyrical tenor voice of Pavarotti, but his flexibility and confident diction more than make up for it. Enough can't be said of Angela Gheorghiu's dramatic impetus, so moving in the 'libera me' that it prompted my roommate, a non-opera fan, to say that she ""couldn't breathe for the last three minutes, and I couldn't even understand why"".

This is a powerful rendition of Verdi's magnum opus. While others may prefer more familiar and better controlled soloists (Karajan's set), this is easier to listen to and often very exciting.",1144627200,13,1908,5.168284789644013
1712618,5,B000066C6K,"Although I have a maximum of 1000 words, only one is needed here: magnificent.
I bought this DVD, got home, and thought I would listen to the beginning to see how it would be. Wrong thought -- there is no way to stop in the middle.
The soloists are unknown to me and they are not the big name performers as in other performances, but this doesn't matter. They set the tone that Abaddo wants.
Abaddo brings out things in the orchestra that I never heard in this requiem. The multiple choirs singing are heavenly.
As I was listening to this recording I could not help but say to myself that this is going to be the recording that everyone will be talking about -- this is an historical legend. This is one of those rare moments in life that you need to cherish. There is no way to put in words the feelings that you get listening and watching this performance. Abbado here is more than a conductor, he is an actor, and a director. He creates an atmosphere.
Give yourself a real treat and listen to/watch this DVD.",1088985600,34,1011,4.326315789473684
1712619,5,B000066C6K,"Almost everything has already been said before. The orchestra and the conducting are excelent, the soloist are very good and the bright and cristal clear sound is incredible!
For those who insist on comparing it with the Karajan record, I have to say that deciding on one of them is a matter of taste, but for those who want the experience the next best thing to being there, this is the one to buy. The great sound of this recording can really bring the best out of a home theater or hifi system.
Thanks Emi for bringing us such a well produced recording of such a great occasion!",1072310400,13,581,4.388888888888889
1712620,4,B000066C6K,"The conducting is very good, The orchestra is excelent and Gheorghiu really shines! Alagna is not the best tenor around, but he is ok. The same aplies to Barcelona. On the other hand, Julian Konstantinov is really very bad for the Requiem... Any one who doesn't own the Karajan version, casting Pavarotti and the extraordinary Ghiaurov,Price and Cossotto, should definitelly buy that one first. But this one is the best second choice around.",1068249600,5,441,5.054794520547945
1712621,5,B000066C6K,"I had the pleasure of attending Mr. Abbado's concerts number of times and I can tell you that his concerts are glorious. Unfortunately, seldom the spirit of his concerts have been successfully captured in his recordings; this DVD nevertheless, is one of those rare occasions. For those of you who inquired about his condition: Mr. Abbado was suffering from stomach cancer but as far as I know he has fully recovered. I met him in person after the opening concert in Carnegie Hall in October of 2001, and I must tell you, his frail face brought tears to my eyes.",1050537600,16,561,4.62
1712622,5,B000066C6K,"The hushed solemn opening of the Requiem with the frail, almost unrecognisable Abbado at the podium must be one of the most moving moments in the history of music making. He, who had just recovered  from a near fatal illness recently (I haven't found out exactly what illness yet) looked as if he was conducting a requiem for himself, and that all the musicians are singing and playing for him. It is therefore difficult not to imaging that this electrifying and gripping performance is a direct result of Abbado's near-death experience (and I felt the same with his recent DG Mahler No. 9 even before I knew about his illness). And what a red-blooded tour-de force performance, especially in the closing pages when Gherorghui sang with such dramatic intensity and with the final, wrenching orchestral climax that Abaddo had to pause for > 10 seconds to allow himself to calm down before he let the audience clap. No need to repeat the praises by other reviewers, except to add that DTS is a superb contribution though it sounds great enough even without it and Alagna is in his greatest form, without any stage fright (as  he sometimes get tensed in live performances) All in all, a disc to die for and definitely a short-list for DVD of the year.",1038182400,29,1248,4.69406392694064
1712623,5,B000066C6K,"This DVD is sensational. Everyone involved from the performers to the camera and sound engineers have done a superlative job.  I bought it because I love the voices of Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna.  I have several other DVDs featuring these singers.  I was unfamiliar with the other soloists but was very impressed with their excellent voices.  The music is so moving it gives you goosebumps! One tiny criticism is that the dynamic range is so great that if you set the volume high enough to hear the opening pianissimo notes (and in one or two other places) the forte sections turn out to be a bit too loud for comfort. This is, however, a very minor complaint in what is otherwise a near-perfect DVD.",1032566400,8,709,4.648
1712624,5,B000066C6K,"An intensly passionate performance of this work by one the world's leading experts on it, played by one of the finest orchestras in world, in one of the finest halls in the world, with 4 of the finest soloists assembled. And all captured on dvd in DTS sound.
If you have ever loved the Verdi requiem and have thought about purchasing a recording of it on dvd then look no further. Not only is this performance comparable to the finest recordings available, it must rank right up there with them.
Abbado (who looks disturbingly frail and gaunt- is there any reason for that? Please someone tell me) brings out the fire and brimstone of the climaxes and yet pulls it all back for the more introspective moments. The end of the work sends a chill down the spine.
 The soloists are magnificent. Georghiu and Alagna are at their best (for anyone that wants to know how to produce a wonderful tone just look at the mouth formations on one of the many closeups of Alagna). The Bartoli lookalike, Barcellona, is superb, especially in the Agnus Dei. Bass Konstantinov needs to remember to bring a towel when he performs, the sweat just comes pouring off him before the first movement ends- and he doesn't do anything about it for some reason. All that aside though he brings a strong presence to the work and a formidible ""Mors Stupebit"" especially.
The chorus is wonderful and clear with superb diction and exceptional balance.
This is a memorable performance- one to buy and cherish for years to come.",1029801600,20,1494,4.659090909090909
1712625,5,B000066C6K,"Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic give a powerful and exciting performance. The only other DVD of Verdi's Requiem that is competitive with this one is the 1967 Karajan performance on Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan has the better quartet of soloists (Leontyne Price, Fiorenza Cossotto, Luciano Pavarotti, and Nicolai Ghiaurov), but Abbado's singers are more than adequate, and his more recent performance has the advantage of superior recorded sound. Karajan obtains the more beautiful pianissimos, but Abbado generates bigger thrills, especially in the Tuba Mirum where he projects the rolling momentum that Karajan misses. NOTE: Other (inferior) DVDs of this work, conducted by Abbado and Karajan respectively, are currently available. Don't get mixed up.",1022457600,48,755,5.75

7962300,4,B000066C6K,"I had heard Verdi's Requiem in a great performance by the Tucson Symphony Orchestra under George Hanson and my aversion to requiems changed to fascination for the Verdi Requiem. I wanted to purchase a copy for my 'library' and used previus reviews here at amazon.com as guideline. I don't consider myself a qualified critic of vocalists. However, I thoroughly enjoy this live recording of the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado with well-balanced soloists and a great chorus.",1363737600,,481,5.259740259740259
7962301,5,B000066C6K,"This is a favourite piece for me and over 50 years I have owned many fine recordings on CD of it, all of which have been fine too - and justifiably. However, this one has now topped them all and now I own just the one performance - and this is it.

The performance grabs the attention from the very start and is it is apparent that it is immediately capable of being ranked with the best. You could pick and choose various small sections at that exalted level and imagine certain other favourite bits instead but once we get to the Libera Me and the last 20 minutes or so we enter a completely different world of experience - that of the inspirational.

Gheorghiu simply brings to her role a level of commitment that is mesmerising and completely at one with both the music and with Abbado's concept. Photographers will tell you that it is always about the eyes - and Georghiu's have it and they never let you go! She brings all her dramatic and communicative operatic skills to bear with extraordinary power and apparent conviction. Every word, every musical phrase is made absolutely special and of extreme importance and relevance.

At the end there is prolonged silence as Abbado struggles to regain his composure and not a sound can be heard from a packed hall. Everyone knows that they have just experienced something special and they are right.

How lucky for us that this has been caught so very well on camera and as sound. The camera work is typical of this team and is both tasteful and effective The surround sound is all one could wish for, although being greedy, I would add that a Blu-ray version would be the icing on the cake! We live in privileged times! Highly recommended with total enthusiasm.",1343520000,4,1714,4.555194805194805
7962302,3,B000066C6K,"I grew up with the Telarc version by Robert Shaw on CD and this just doesn't quite fit what I was looking for. Hold on to your remote control because the dynamic range is immense if you are trying to hear the soft sections and it builds to a thunderous roar in a few seconds. I just don't think the soloists were mic'd correctly to stand out. Alagna seemed weak in voice, Angela was gorgeous but I agree a little too dramatic and poor Juluan was a fountain of sweat. The most disappointing aspect of the DVD was the subtitles. Granted in masses these composers tend to repeat phrases....but for those of us who do not know Latin repeating the translation would really help in enjoying the mass. It seems at times as if we did not see a subtitle for about 10 minutes.",1334188800,3,766,4.326388888888889
7962303,5,B000066C6K,"From the moment that Claudio Abbado crossed the stage of the Philharmonic to take his place on the podium, it seemed that we were in the presence of the walking dead.
Much has been made by other reviewers of the conductor's ravaged appearance, the consequence of severe illness prior to this recording, and its positive impact on the performance. I take the opposite view. To me, the eminent maestro's grip on the proceedings was decidedly shaky, and emphasized the magnificent professionalism of the BPO who seemeingly might have carried on equally well without him. Of course, one never knows from a live performance what may have gone on in rehearsals behind the scenes, and perhaps it was in this scenario that Abbado stamped his ideas and personality upon the music, but many of his directorial movements and baton-waving were ugly to behold, and seemed like the death throes of a terminally ill mortal. After the final note, I was convinced that he was about to expire altogether. A Requiem Mass that concludes with an actual death is no everyday occurrence, and the above simulation certainly adds to the drama of the occasion, even though the visual result is far from pretty.
All of this is an excuse to say something derogatory to balance the superlatives that one otherwise owes to this astonishing DVD that in many respects is beyond mere perfection. No finer orchestral sound has ever emerged from my speakers. The visual close-ups of the orchestra and their instruments were a feast of the photographers' art. The soloists comprised a strong team that varied from the more than adequate Barcellona and Konstantinov through the exquisite Georghiu, to the gloriously heroic Alagna who turned in the greatest vocal performance I have heard him give in any medium. Since the soloists sing much more frequently in combination rather than individually compard with most oher choral works, it is important to emphasize the wonderfully discrete separation of the voices in the sound recording, and the clarity that results. This effect was enhanced by the fine camera work that singled out the singers to the extent that one could almost read their lips ( George Bush would have been pleased), but it came at a small price: I was initially concerned about the quality of the video that seemed to be cut in sections at times by vertical lines, until I realized that it was merely the leads to the myriad microphones that were being captured by the camera. Some reviewers thought that the close-ups were too intimate. This bothered me only in the case of Konstantinov whose prodigious sweating became evident 5 minutes into the performance and grew steadily more profuse as the music progressed. The prospect of his joining Abbado in an early grave could not be ruled out.
Finally, a word of praise for a silent participant: the stunning Philharmonic that is my favourite concert hall and provided such a distinguished background for an equally distinguished performance.",1289952000,4,2975,4.987927565392354
7962304,5,B000066C6K,"With amusement I read comments that complain about the dramatics of the soloists. Look. This is Verdi. This is not the Mozart Requiem. Critics complained after the first performace that the work is an opera in choral disguise, and of course they were right. Gheorghiu is an opera singer, and she oftens performs with her husband, Alagna. They are both excellent, though not outstanding. Barcellona is wonderful, and Konstantinov gets by. Abbado is his usual expressive and dominant self. The performace itself is certainly dramatic -- but then again, it's Verdi. All in all, the best DVD performance of the Requiem, with effect and impact.",1245110400,5,639,5.095238095238095
7962305,3,B000066C6K,"With such a fine chorus and orchestra, sensitively conducted by the maestro, it comes as a complete disappointment to hear and see the grimacing soloists. The soprano is beautiful in looks, but her libera me is more grimace than tone.",1212019200,,234,4.875
7962306,3,B000066C6K,"I was very disappointed when I viewed this DVD.  The Berlin Philharmonic plays beautifully, but EMI has such a wide range of sound that very quiet bits (such as the bass drum at ""mors stupebit"") are inaudible and loud passages can simply be too loud.  The Chorus sings excellently, although in a tight-lipped sort of way in matters of enunciation.  So:  three stars for the orchestra and chorus.

The soloists are horrendous.  They grimace and pop their eyes and and wring their hands.  If this were a performance of Il Trovatore I'd still say they were hamming it up.  All in all they look grotesque and prove greatly distracting.  The singing is forced (especially bass and tenor) and often louder than Verdi asks for.

I'm selling this one off as soon as I can.  In the meantime, I have received the recent DVD release of Leonard Bernstein conducting the Verdi Requiem in St. Paul's Cathedral in London.  The solo singing is superb (check out the four soloists: Arroyo, Veasey, Domingo, and Raimondi!) and the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus cannot be faulted.  Bernstein's conducting style can often seem overly dramatic, but in a space as large as St. Paul's it comes across as necessary and even devout. The DVD is a transfer of a performance filmed in 1970 and released in 1992 on VHS, but the images are clear and the sound is excellent.  And the price is right.

It's all a matter of taste, but even admitting that this is so, the highly favorable reviews do not seem to refer to the performace I saw and heard on this DVD.",1195430400,5,1537,4.619926199261992
