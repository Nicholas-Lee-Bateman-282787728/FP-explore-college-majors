It is about a group of young women from various locations, backgrounds, and employment; which makes it that much more interesting.  This should be considered an inspirational movie with dream like locations for surf trips and vacations.  It shows some of the best possible qualities that a woman can have: grace, strength, beauty, confidence, skill, sweetness, humor, and love or aloha spirit. The cinematography is great and the locations interesting.

I have three daughters 8, 10, and 12...we all surf in my family and I consider this movie to be inspirational, iconic, and a template on how they should approach their lives...as women, surfers, and citizens.

Reasons not to like this movie...1. You can't surf, which is ok...or you're jealous because they surf better than you and in better locations.  2.  You're from Minnesota and have never been to the ocean and are jealous. 3.  You do not like listening to women share there points of view on life, surfing, friendship, or anything else for that matter.  5. You dislike watching beautiful women (inner/outer)surfing and having a good time.

Great movie for girls and young women or anyone who desire for adventure.  You don't have to be a surfer or a girl/woman to enjoy this movie.

8122695,1,B000FI8MNY,I have nothing more to say.  I hope no one allows these filmmakers to make another film.  So much potential with the setup but no follow through or thought process.,1237766400,,164,4.433333333333334
8122696,1,B000FI8MNY,Unfortunately the Girl-surf movie I payed for was not what I got. THe Level of female surfing I know is much higher than what was shown in the 2 minutes of actual surfing. It's basically a home video of some girls on vacation.,1236038400,,226,4.27906976744186
