2562626,5,B000FFJYCK,"While I agree with other reviewers that some of the conclusions and connections made in this ambitious series risk being overstated and oversimplified, there is so much fascinating material here, so magnificently presented, that I would hate to discourage anyone from seeing this extraordinary achievement.  I was utterly in awe of the production values -- the attention to detail in terms of framing scenes with stunning natural landscapes, dynamic (including computer-enhanced) art direction, strategic use of archival footage, and making generous use of experts from multiple disciplines.  The filmmakers here have cleverly applied many of the theories they discuss on what makes art effective and persuasive to making the documentary itself extremely compelling, from having the camera linger with mesmerizing intensity on the world's most dramatic images, shifting points of view to maintain interest, and employing dramatic tension to advance the narrative.  While Dr. Spivey is a highly charismatic and erudite presenter, the way his rugged good looks and toned physique are exploited, in the semiotic context of this particular film, occasionally made me laugh out loud.  Nonetheless, this series, which is somewhat reminiscent of Bill Moyers's wonderful interviews with Joseph Campbell, is a rare and visionary achievement, marrying the disciplines of art history, archeology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience, to give us a transcendent view of the way art both reflects and molds human culture.",1183593600,30,1514,5.7155555555555555
2562627,5,B000FFJYCK,"I watched this whole 350,000 years' worth of art on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Very well done. Helped me get a visual perspective chronologically, rather than flipping through pages of art history books. As a teacher, I would suggest the DVD is not for elementary or middle school aged classes, but possibly for higher level art students. VERY helpful in studying for National Board Assessments.",1179273600,4,394,5.076923076923077
2562628,5,B000FFJYCK,"This DVD set is amazing. I saw one episode and decided to see the rest. Just seeing what art meant to ancient civilizations captured me. Nigel Spivey presents each civilization in a way that all understand and can relate to. I would recommend this to anyone interested in art or art history, or anyone for that matter.",1168473600,7,318,4.5964912280701755
2562629,5,B000FFJYCK,I just love it. It is a great review about art since ancient times through 20th century.  If you enjoy learning about art you have to consider this book for your library.,1168387200,3,170,4.3125
2562630,4,B000FFJYCK,"Rather than a sweeping history of art this film excels at discussing a few fascinating subjects including the 25,000 year old Venus von Willendorf, 3,000 years of unchanging art in Egypt, Greek sculpture and their fascination with the body, the 12,000 year old Goblecki Tepe which far predates Stonehenge, and cave paintings.  Also discussed but less interesting is how kings and politicians have used images to convey their power, and how images of death are used both to terrify and reassure.  Subjects usually found in an art history book such as the Renaissance, Baroque, and modern art are not mentioned at all.

Some of the conclusions presented are not well supported and seem contrived.  However there are enough fascinating subjects to make this well worth watching.",1165276800,23,775,5.126984126984127
2562631,5,B000FFJYCK,"This is a really fascinating, very accessable series for any student of art and culture. Nigel Spivey is a very personable host, open-minded and a little humorous.  The series included a number of surprising ""new"" connections and conclusions about ancient art and man's life today.  I watched the first hour on a DVD borrowed from the local library, and immediately got online at Amazon to get my own copy.  I have watched the entire set a number of times and still am picking up new information.  I have used the section on ""How Drawings Began"" in the classroom with 5th graders, who were spellbound.  I have recommended this set to all my friends and colleagues.  If you have any interest in art and culture of mankind, I highly recommend this series!",1163030400,10,753,4.709923664122138
2562632,3,B000FFJYCK,"This is an examination of various aspects of art - depiction of human form, origins of painting, storytelling, art of persuasion, depictions of death - and connecting their origins to today. Interesting stuff. It is visually stunning, and presented in a dramatic way that is entertaining.

One of the most interesting parts was the section on Gobekli Tepe, in Turkey, where huge engraved pillars were erected 12,000 years ago. This was the same time and place where wheat was first cultivated, and people moved from hunting/gathering to farming. The theory presented was that the  agricultural endeavor was begun in order to feed the thousands involved in building and enjoying these decorated pillars. This differs from the usual assumption that people went where the food was and then culture developed. Intriguing.

My issue with this series is the unquestioning acceptance of brain theories in some of their analyses. People in unrelated cultures made figurines of the female form with rotund bellies and breasts, and minimized other features. Baby birds whose mothers have red stripes on them peck at  sticks with red stripes painted on them. Therefore, a brain expert declares, it is hardwired in our brains to exaggerate  certain characteristics.  Where is the evidence that it has anything to do with the brain? And what does ""hardwired  in our brains"" mean, exactly? It always amazes me when silly theories are accepted without question because they are expressed with an air of authority by an ""expert"". It is not  surprising that unrelated people in harsh environments, where starvation and racial extinction were real concerns, would make a fetish of the female form looking well fed, pregnant and laden with milk. Nowadays, we are more concerned with obesity and overpopulation, so we find the gaunt form attractive. The tendency to exaggerate favored characteristics is a conscious aesthetic decision, no hardwiring needed.

In the part on death - comparing comforting and frightening images of death through the ages - it is said that people - even children - feel bad when someone dies because they're worried about their own death. That is an unwarranted generalization. I think most people feel bad because they miss the person who died, or worry about losing someone else. If children are concerned about their own death, I think it is because they are reminded of a previous death, as in the end of a previous lifetime. The spiritual aspect of these subjects is completely neglected in this series.

Nevertheless, it is worth watching for its unique approach to art history, and the relating of various periods and cultures. Just fast forward through the psychobabble.",1162339200,85,2688,5.144495412844036
2562633,5,B000FFJYCK,"This 5-part BBC documentary series (2005) is a fascinating look at why humans developed representational imagery or visual art, and how visual art has shaped the world we live in today. It's a topic that has been tackled before but here we see it from an archaeological as well as socio-anthropological perspective (Dr Nigel Spivey is a lecturer in both Classical Art and Archaeology at Cambridge University). His views are buttressed with insights from neuroscientists and psychologists. The focus is purely on the visual arts and centres on ancient and prehistoric art. It tackles broad questions such as why humans want or need to create visual images, why especially images of humans and why the predilection for distorted forms? Why humanity sees the need to represent death in art. How visual art is used for social and political purposes. How visual art has been refined to be the storytelling medium par excellence. It is meant for the lay audience and is easily accessible even to the uninitiated. Spivey is a captivating host and puts his ideas across clearly and succinctly.

The 5 episodes (58 mins each) are:
Ep. 1: More Human than Human - Why have humans felt the need to create visual representations of themselves and specifically why indulge in distortions of the human form? Is this hardwired in the human brain? What can we learn from modern studies in neuroscience?
Ep. 2: The Day Pictures Were Born - What might have been the reasons for the Paleolithic cave paintings of Altamira and Lascaux? What can the the more recent cave paintings left by the San bushman in the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa tell us? What have studies into altered states of consciousness taught us and how is this applicable to our understanding of the cave paintings?
Ep. 3: The Art of Persuasion - The role of visual art throughout human history to organise and mobilise society; to persuade, to propagandise, to lie. From its earliest use by Darius of Persia, through Alexander the Great, to Caesar Augustus, to the modern spin-meisters of Bush and Blair.
Ep. 4: Once Upon A Time - The role of visual art in story-telling, from its earliest beginnings as carved scenes on the Palace walls of King Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, to the marble statues of Classical Greece, to the epic carvings on Trajan's Column, to the Hollywood spectacles of today. Includes a fascinating reappraisal of Australian Aboriginal art, seen in its cultural context as a blend of picture, story, music and dance and how one element cannot be divorced from the other, making it one of mankind's earliest forerunners to the modern film.
Ep. 5: To Death and Back - Humanity's fear and fascination with death and how we utilise art in an attempt to conquer it. How images of death are used to gird a society under external threat. Examines the significance of ancient images of death. Compares Christian iconography with ancient Aztec and Incan representations of death.

One criticism is that Spivey is at times too emphatic in his conclusions. What he proposes may certainly be true but we cannot be sure of that (reasons for people producing distorted human imagery - the meaning of paleolithic paintings - the role of death in art). What we can say is that they are valid conclusions in the light of present knowledge. Still as an entry point for the lay audience, it is an excellent series. And Spivey certainly charges the viewer with his sheer enthusiasm.

The series is shot in 1.78:1 widescreen and presented as such on DVD (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picture quality is excellent. Photography is often stunning. Sound is in front-centered, crystal clear, 2.0 Dolby Surround. Optional English subtitles are provided. Extras include a 5-minute long interview with Spivey and Mark Hedgecoe on the series, as well as roughly 12 minutes worth of footage on shooting at the Gobekli Tepe archaeological site in modern Turkey. This series is accompanied by a fully illustrated companion book written by Nigel Spivey available separately from BBC Press.",1157932800,105,4031,4.960059171597633

2562656,5,B000FFJYCK,Art and artists create and reflect so much of the zeitgeist of their times. For some reason we discard art as illustrative or decorative. This work gets it right by demonstration that art moves people in ways that words cannot.,1356393600,,227,4.7
2562657,5,B000FFJYCK,"I rented this documentary from my local video store, and then couldn't remember the name!  I would periodically go in and search through all their documentaries trying to find it again.  I had seen the art of archaeology presented in a light I never had before seen, and especially was impressed by sections covering the skulls found in the 'Walls of Jericho' and the temples at Gobekli Tepe.  I tried Googling every combination of those words, and finally, about 3 years later ( must be good, right?  to look for it that long?) I found it.  Trust me, it is that good...it covers the psychology of art, the evolution of art from the Venus of Willendorf to modern, with scholastic attention to history and archaeology.  It is truly a great set...two DVDs.  Get it, you won't be sorry.",1355788800,,783,4.630434782608695
2562658,3,B000FFJYCK,"I found the subjects interesting and somewhat thought provoking. I consider many of the ideas plausible but questionable, thus I was intrigued enough to investigate a bit further, especially regarding the political focus of ""The Art of Persuasion."" In this segment Dr. Spivey mostly presents art as a tool of political manipulation and fails to adequately consider art for honestly projecting a political position. Certainly art can influence in a good or bad way, in an honest or deceitful way. Researching historical timelines of art, empires and leaders reveals his interpretation of events questionable.

At one point he performs a useless, unscientific test to prove the power of the face. In an election for an art leadership position, 100 college students vote for either him based on his face or his opponent based on a symbol. He wins, proving the face is more powerful! Well, those college students shown appear to be limited to a young age range. Which would older people choose? And perhaps a majority are females who find him cute. Or perhaps many of these students know him.

The problem with such subjects is they are not an objective, measurable science. It is interesting speculation and one should be careful not to present subjective ideas as historical fact. If you enjoy art and history I think you will find this dvd interesting, but don't accept too much as fact.",1346198400,4,1386,4.969827586206897
2562659,5,B000FFJYCK,"This is an excellent, truly superb video. It's insightful, intelligent, inspired and something that truly everyone needs to see.

2562660,5,B000FFJYCK,"This is a fantastic DVD. It is so much more than an art lesson. It weaves incredible history, literature, and the human experience into the world of art. I am so impressed with the people behind this series. They went to great lengths to bring each piece of this story to life. I learned so much, yet was completely entertained throughout this 2 disc set. I give this my highest recommendation!",1298246400,2,394,4.563380281690141
2562661,1,B000FFJYCK,"I wasted enough time watching this so that I am not very inclined to write a lengthy review.

Key problems:

1. Unsubstantiated assertions on a wide variety of subjects. Quite silly in some cases. Morally corrupt and historically biased in others.
Love the seagull thing. Haha. What a crazy laugh that was. And what an ""expert"" they found to draw the most insane connections between us and ze birds.

2. Man is dealt with, and accepted to be an ""animal"", controlled by instincts and subconscious, primordial desires as opposed to much in the way of reason. Makes you wonder how we're capable of even watching this dvd without assistance. This doesn't just apply to the prehistoric world, but also to Ancient Greece apparently. I wonder what Aristotle would say to that.

3. The heroic nature of man and the art he has created is turned on its head, and we are led down another poor attempt at a modern version of Clark's Civilization.

More silly marxist/elitist/materialist/determinist garbage from the once great BBC. I was hoping that at any moment the Dalek's would show up and exterminate the condescending, pretentious narrator.

Yes, you need to listen and think carefully about what this man is saying to get really annoyed. But I did. And got it.

What happened to the Brits anyway? If they won't make us smart now, who will? Better learn Chinese fast.",1294012800,12,1361,4.815450643776824
2562662,5,B000FFJYCK,"This video is exceptional, because it truly explains why humans make art, why we make it in the ways we do, and what is interesting about the art we make.  If you've ever wished you could better appreciate a trip to a museum, or understand what makes both ancient Greek sculpture and the paintings of Picasso great, this series will be truly enlightening for you.  The best thing about it is that it puts art in the context of society, psychology, the science of the brain, and history-- this isn't just art appreciation for those that like to look at pretty pictures-- this is a true explanation of deep-seated psychological, scientific, and historical drives, and how those drives manifest themselves in art.

The production is quite serious, and lacks the silliness of most American productions that can be seen on the Discovery Channel  or National Geographic.  I was impressed by the the fact that even though the program dealt with topics that were challenging to a layman, I never felt ""talked down to.""

Anyone who would like to gain a better appreciation for both human nature, and art, should be fascinated by this great series.",1270684800,2,1138,4.81025641025641
2562663,4,B000FFJYCK,"Context. It seems to be the underlying theme in this series -- that every work of art is produced by a human brain within a cultural context.

Other reviewers have aptly pointed out the shortcomings of this series, and I could add a few more, but instead I want to let those considering viewing or purchasing this series know that perhaps the most redeeming aspect of this product is it's treatment of these two themes: brains and violence.

Two episodes stood out for me.

One looks at cave paintings as the product of artists who went to caves to experience sensory deprivation, have visions, and create art as a response to the sacred. To say this, as I have just done, sounds a little flaky, but to watch the episode, with it's slow unraveling of the mystery through visits to caves, experts, and finally an experiment on the host, is to suddenly see a new explanation as if you discovered it yourself.

The other episode that stood out for me is the last one in which the art of death is examined. The 40,000 deaths at the ancient Aztec(?) temple and the explanation for why people would stand for it was an earth shaking revelation for me. People would rather be on the side of the killers than on the other side. This tied with the research showing that people reminded of their own mortality are more likely to lash out at people not in their group, revealed something about our political leaders continual fascination with war. It is a way to gain loyalty and reinforce group cohesion. Art can either facilitate this mechanism, or reveal it for what it is.

For me, the insights just seemed to tumble out of this episode about religion, video games, non-violence, and relationships in the various groups I'm involved in.

I guess if you are coming to this series as an art historian, or a historian of any sort, you will find lots to complain about, but if you are interested in the psychology of art, this is a great source of ideas and insights.",1266278400,3,1956,4.542613636363637
2562673,5,B000FFJYCK,"This series of five (approx. 1 hour each)segments asks and attempts to answer big, conceptual ideas in which art plays a central role. I'm a high school art teacher and have struggled to find videos which engage high school age kids and doesn't put them to sleep. This series and Schoma's ""Power of Art"" come as close as I've found to that goal. You won't find a pure chronological flow, but instead there are questions such as ""How did the first artist manage to create a 2D image without ever being taught?"" (Hypothesis: hallucinations). First, second and last segments are the strongest.",1265155200,4,590,4.794117647058823

2562676,4,B000FFJYCK,The series is very intriguing and enlightening and I hope that there will be more episodes added in the future.  One thing that I find puzzling/disturbing however is that there is a conspicuous absence of Asian art.,1247529600,4,215,4.8108108108108105
2562677,5,B000FFJYCK,"Wonderful photography and lighting make this program outstanding.  The psychology, including some experiments done to back it up, was thought provoking and overall reminiscent of Joseph Campbell's series: The Power of Myth - also highly recommended.  David Attenborough only appears in one episode, for about 10 minutes, both in the present and in some footage from the 1960s, which is a special treat for his fans.  This is not a history of art, but an exploration of its meaning and impact through the ages and today.  A bit uneven and overly dramatic at times, I think it is worth viewing.
UPDATE: You can watch the first episode (and the introduction) online for free by doing a Google search.  Also found an entry in Wikipedia that gives lots more detailed info if you're undecided about a purchase.",1232064000,3,804,4.882352941176471

As usual, we were not disappointed! There is something for everybody in this documentary, it has a logical build-up, with great photography and excellent camera work. The topic is clear, and presented lively, with many facts. I learned a lot.

This documentary covers many of the topics I incorporated into my course in order to bring my students into the world of art from their various majors. Cross-over view points such as portrayed throughout this program give people an opportunity to think about the world around them from a different paradigm. Many students today are so oriented on just taking a course for the sake of a grade, they are often blind to the actual interest of the topics being studied. I always felt that if I had simply wedged the door into the world of inquiry just a tiny bit wider, I had accomplished an important goal in 15 weeks.

That the filmmakers believe they are performing the equivelant of translating the Rosetta Stone here-with-in is quite evident by the hubris of including their ""Special Features"" section, which consists of the filmmakers talking about setting up certain shots; what kind of a self-important mind could conceive that anyone would want to waste their time watching them relate that their camera crane showed up late one night.

Most outrageous were his premises and conclusion about the power of pending death has on art.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested looking for an introductory offering to art history. But I would view with a skeptical eye.",1197331200,2,453,5.053333333333334
2562691,1,B000FFJYCK,"""Yes, you heard him. He did say `Seagulls'."" It's statements like these that make this documentary insipidly condescending.  The narrator seems to think he can hide his blandness by jerking and nodding his head to every one of his banal syllables. These poor people also seem to think that they can improve a crappy documentary with fancy special effects. Many will no doubt fall for the trick. This kind of thing confirms my feeling that some establishment out there is bent on destroying the world's IQ.",1196294400,8,505,4.872093023255814
2562692,3,B000FFJYCK,"David Attenbourough presents a lot of interesting educational information in this DVD. The major problem is that his assertions about the importance, impact and universality of art are very very weak.  This is not to say
that all his assertions are false either.  He just makes very weak arguments for his case.  I noticed he also has a book ""How Art Made
the World"".  Perhaps he does a better job there presenting his information.
Besides, this major flaw, I found the DVD intersting and did learn some history from it.",1194220800,4,520,4.7444444444444445

Wonderfully entertaining and enlightening.",1188777600,,272,5.325581395348837
2562695,5,B000FFJYCK,I highly recommend this series to anyone who teaches to high school or college students in art appreciation classes. Dr Spivey treats each episode as if it were a mystery and presents theories that stimulate creative class discussions.,1185753600,3,235,5.2105263157894735

8121718,1,B000FFJYCK,I ordered this DVD as a required material for a class. The first episode played great but all other episodes froze through chunks of the program. I'm hoping I just got a bad DVD and the next one I order ASAP will play better. Waste of my money currently due to the fact that it will not play.,1486598400,,292,4.051724137931035

8121723,4,B000FFJYCK,"While it doesn't have cursing or anything too objectively explicit. Showing nude art in school or sculptures depicting violence can upset students below 5th grade. You don't want the kids going ""I saw a picture of a man getting his head cut off in a sculpture."" When they get home. Maybe save it for high school.",1457740800,,312,4.589285714285714
