7770442,5,B01GWCMWQO,"This is THE box set to own.  I never purchased the Rhino releases but Shout Factory's treatment of this venerable series is most excellent.  From the Dolby Pro Logic soundtrack to the imperfections that crop up in some episodes (no doubt present on the broadcast masters) this is the Transformers as I remember them.

I ordered this edition from Shout Factory directly since I wasn't sure if it would be available from other vendors.  All 16 discs were present and accounted for as well as two magnets (Autobot and Decepticon), a 60-page booklet, and a flier for the G.I. Joe collector's set.  If you're a Transformers fan this is the most complete edition of the series worth owning to date.  Buy it and enjoy!",1253664000,20,711,4.693548387096774
7770443,2,B01GWCMWQO,"This was a *really expensive* upgrade from my previous collection of G1 Transformers cartoons.  Some of the special features are nice, don't get me wrong, but ultimately what I wanted was the cartoons... and I already had them, at a better price, years before this release.  There's plenty of good things to say about this set, but ultimately, this is one helluva high price tag to put on some 25-year-old cartoons.  I cannot recommend this set over other installments, particularly the Chinese option with its secondary English audio tracks (You guys know the one, right?).  Buying THAT over THIS would save you $50-80 depending on the seller.

I hate to be such a naysayer, but Hasbro et al have made a pretty damning cash-grab here.  This is clearly for them, not for the fans.",1253664000,6,780,4.7835820895522385
7770444,5,B01GWCMWQO,"This set is quite amazing.  Period.  But as a collector, it really depends on how you roll... er... or how you transform and roll out.  I'm a completist.  I was too late in collecting the previous releases on DVD and just prayed and waited around forever for this wonderful release.

You can indeed find the complete set for $140 on the SHOUT website; who knows, Amazon often drops their price by the release date, but for now, it can be found, alongside the complete GI JOE set with free shipping.

The packaging, unfortunately, is a lot of thin cardboard -- with the CD cases being cardboard with plastic trays; not very durable, not sure how they'll hold up to the test of time with repeat handling.  I wish the outside case, at least, was heavy duty like the GI JOE complete set box, especially for $140; one could most likely collect the individual releases for the same price with how cheap these individual seasons often go down on Amazon.  Although, the set does consist of a few rarities not found in the individual releases.

Call me 'Crazy', but I am collecting BOTH releases.  I love picture discs and packaging.  Especially for the individual releases which contain thin-pak jewel cases and cartoon character pictures on the discs.  The characters on the complete set discs are more computer-generated images... NOT CGI, but rather, what a Transformer might look like after being scanned for replication.

On a side note, the ""More Than Meets The Eye"" introduction DVD, the first five episodes of season one sold seperately, is a nice collectable too, comes in a regular jewel case, and though the image is the same as the first disc in season one, it has a blue background rather than a purple background... subtle, but cool.  And, yes, I have this in my collection as well.  Crazy.

The collected book (episode summaries) is quite nice that comes with the complete set, it includes some Tranformer bios... the individual releases come with mini-booklets that only contain the episode summaries, both having different cover designs, so again, to me it is worth collecting both releases.

GI JOE side note (for completists); for the complete set, the 17 discs have the same characters as the individual release... however, the complete set discs have the original hand-drawn character profile picture, whereas the individual set releases have the cartoon character image on the discs.  And, the individually released introduction DVD ""The M.A.S.S. Device"" has three figher jets with the red white and blue jetstreams as the picture disc, so they're all quite different.  Also, interesting to point out, there's an empty tray slot, an ""18th"" disc spot for the 1987 GI JOE movie that does not come with the set, hopefully it's released at a later date.  Not sure why the Transformers movie wasn't included in the complete TF set.  Too bad... or had an empty ""17th"" disc spot.",1253145600,35,2886,4.860940695296524
7770445,5,B01GWCMWQO,"As another reviewer wrote, it is indeed possible to order this directly from Shout, for $140.00 w/free shipping.  If Amazon did not offer any discount on this then the Shout offer would clearly be superior.  But Amazon DOES offer a discount, which substantially narrows the difference.  Further, Shout charges sales tax to orders from California, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky whereas Amazon does not.  So, where I live the prices are virtually identical and in fact, Amazon's price with the current discount is .66 cents less for me than if I had ordered this from Shout.

As for the set itself, Shout's website lists it as including ""98 episodes, a 60-page Book, Autobot & Decepticon Magnets, 3 scripts w/ handwritten notes, all 5 of the PSA's, 5 featurettes (2 of which are exclusive to this set), a voice cast reunion, Hasbro toy commercials, 2 concept art galleries, a fan art gallery and an animated fan film entitled 'Transformers: Generation One'"".

7770475,4,B01GWCMWQO,"This release gives the first season of Transformers a much better version than the one Rhino put out.  In an attempt to fix animation errors present in the source material, Rhino ended up adding new ones.  They initially offered a choice between new soundtracks with added effects that drowned out the dialogue and that nobody asked for or wanted or the original mono mix.  Then, they gave up and only had the 5.1 soundtracks with the new effects.

Shout! Factory's release goes back to the drawing board and presents a version that looks more like its source material than Rhino's did.

Starting with Season 2, though, Shout! Factory starts to mirror the Rhino release.  Both sets released the first half of season 1 with the wrong commercial bumper animation.  They reused the Season 1 bumpers instead of the Season 2 bumpers.

Season 3 from Shout! Factory has the same problems with Five Faces Of Darkness that Rhino's release did.  Five Faces had its own animated opening that was different than all other Season 3 episodes.  Both companies released the episodes as a mix of sometimes using the right opening and sometimes not.  Shout! Factory, though, does go one step further in the wrong direction that one episode uses the right animation, but the wrong audio from the other animation.  So, the sound effects don't match the dialogue.  Five Faces is also missing the To Be Continued cards at the end of some episodes.

Some Season 3 episodes have to be considered incomplete.  The Secret Files Of Tele-Tran 2 segments that were included at the end of some episodes are not present in the episodes themselves.  They are included in a bunch as a extra on the Season 3 bonus features disc.  However, some of them have to also be considered incomplete because some are missing their ""From the secret files of Tele-Tran 2"" introductions.  These segments were part of the episodes as they originally aired.  Thus, the episodes must be called incomplete without them.

However, Shout! Factory did get something right that Rhino missed even though they were expressly told to watch for a different in Dark Awakening.  Rhino used the Return Of Optimus Prime preview version.  Shout! Factory uses the correct version of Dark Awakening without the narration over the end credits added to preview The Return Of Optimus Prime.  BUT, they did NOT include a version of the episode that aired the day before Return Of Optimus aired, which is slightly altered at the end to include a voice over introducing ""tomorrow's exciting episode: The Return Of Optimus Prime!""

Shout! Factory's Matrix Of Leadership boxed set contains some special features discs that are not present in the other Transformers DVD releases for the G1.  They're light on content, so, if you bought the series already in these other forms, getting this boxed set for those discs is not really that much of a value.  There's also an Optimus Prime magnet.  Again, not really worth getting this boxed set if you already bought the individual releases.  However, if you're just looking for the entire series and can find this boxed set, it's a great value for any Transformers fan.",1334188800,,3139,4.871698113207547
7770476,4,B01GWCMWQO,"First of all let me say I am very happy to have got this. One of the best DVD box sets I own. I got it on sale at walmart.com about 2 years ago. This is a great show for those of us who are die hard transformers fans. However, the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it dosen't include the first animated movie. It would have been a good idea to do so because if you haven't seen it there is a huge story gap in between the first few and last few seasons. It is probably a good idea to buy it with this for that reason. Unless you know what happens in that gap you will be very confused like I was. I am not saying don't buy this just that you should be ready for some research if you do.",1329955200,,703,3.7248322147651005
7770497,5,B01GWCMWQO,"I have waited very long for this as there were Chinese bootleg versions (thinner version) going around in the market and I have to be very careful when purchasing. I am glad that I have gotten the real deal here and this is definitely a must buy for Transformers fans.

Cheers",1323216000,,276,4.411764705882353
7770498,5,B01GWCMWQO,"I must start off by saying that I haven't made it all the way through the series yet.  With that said, I don't think you need to watch every last second before you know how amazing this set is!  It has the entire series along with an Autobot and a Decepticon magnet.  The only thing it's missing in my opinion is the animated movie but chances are, if you're shelling out $100 +, you probably already have it.

I've read some reviews where people were complaining about certain technical issues and really getting into some crazy detail about audio and animation quality.  To me, and I'm a pretty hardcore fan with a respectable collection of toys,  I think it adds to the charm.  Complaining about the animation is like saying a beautiful girl is ugly because she has black pepper stuck in her teeth after dinner.  Some people are really bothered by that type of stuff, are you?",1318896000,2,879,4.518987341772152

its wonderful set if you like show when you where kid has all episodes some unexplained situations death of prime in movie, in season 4 he comes back from the dead to rejoin autobots & few others great set, great special features if your fan of transfromers & have the money get this set if you do not feel like buying seperate volumes of the show",1302912000,,638,4.406779661016949
7770500,1,B01GWCMWQO,"You probably didn't know that Shout Factory released two versions of this set.  The first, the 2009 or ""Fat"" set was a great product, well-made and packed with bonuses.

But then came 2010 and the ""slim"" set.  Unfortunately, this is the set I wound up with.  It's made of more fragile stuff than the 2009 set, with a less sturdy box, magnets attached to wax paper that seems like it was torn off of something, and worst of all the discs themselves are packaged in CARDBOARD SLEEVES, ""protected"" by plastic bags!  This protection is not enough, and when I got this set many of the discs were damaged and unwatchable.  I'm going to return it to the seller I bought it from.  Shout Factory should be ashamed of having made something so cheap and fragile!

To be honest, at this point it might be better to just buy the individual Season sets.  There's very little here that isn't duplicated here, and most of you just want to watch the episodes and could care less about a bonus interview (which isn't really anything special) and a ""collector's booklet"" (which is just summaries of the episodes, with lame trivia for about four of them).  Not to mention, the ""Good"" version of this set is rather bulky and, as others have mentioned, does not have space set aside for The Movie.  Finally, the seasons can be found for $10-$15 apiece, while the Matrix set will cost you $100-$200 most likely.  The bottom line is:  if you didn't get this set when it was new, you're better off without it.

If you absolutely MUST have it though, then be sure to ask questions and make sure you're getting the *right* one!  Don't get gypped!",1302566400,5,1619,4.5344827586206895

The content is great including all of the episodes from the G1 series, oddly missing the movie though.  The biggest drawback is the DVD cases themselves.  The ones i received were very thin card board with and i kid you not the discs that sat in plastic bags thing disc shaped wal-mart bags.  the DVDs themselves were actually a little roughed up due to this fact.  One DVD even had the glue the glue melt from the cardboard onto the data side so I'm not sure if it's damaged or not as of this writing.  The dvd cases i've already unfortunately torn trying to get the discs out because of aforementioned plastic bags.

7770504,5,B01GWCMWQO,"Having watched the RHINO releases before this. I have to say that the SHout Factory version is by far superior. THey have fixed many of the issues that Rhino put in when the tried to fix the pre broadcast videos they used.

THe packaging in the Matrix Edition is just simply... wow! THe sliding sides to reveal the full Matrix spark that is then lifted up to show the goodies. From beginning to end the picture quality is clear as a bell, much clearer than Rhino's.

The only issue is that Season 3 episodes are out of order in the continuity sense. I understand that that was due to a directive from HAsbro but, Octane finding ""Starscreams GHost"" while on the run from the Decepticons is before the episode (THief in the Night) that show's why the Decepticons are after him in the first place.

A minor issue (except that THief in the Night is on a seperate disc, so to do the continuity right you would have to pull the first disc out and put the second disc in and then back to the first disc to watch Starscream's ghost which is the last episode on DIsc one so after that you would then need to put back in Disc Two to carry on. A minor annoyance but still rather odd. THe Booklet is fantastic. With the artwork and Bios pulled from the hard to find DreamWaves ""More Than Meets The Eye"" issues. So that's important. The Extras are fun, although the kids fuzzy faces in the commercials are a little off putting.

All in all if you are a big transformer fan and want to see the interview with Bob Budiansky then this is a must and it's a steal at the amazon sale price.

There are some extras like period commercials and advertisements, which are nice, but my real complaint is with Hasbro's continued insistance on presenting the episodes in their original airing order. This is not the intended release order (chronological order), or the order recognized by the episode numbering. It's frustrating to have to exit to the DVD menu to find the next episode in the series because if you select ""play all"" it may skip 3 ahead, then go back to the ones missed, making no sense at all.

A book with a synopsis of every episode, plus a bio on some of your favorite autobots and decepticons.

7770567,5,B01GWCMWQO,"This set is well worth the price to re-live your childhood (for those who think its expensive for something 25 years old, think about what you just said. Its 25 yrs old! A lot of work goes into restoration.) Okay, now to get going.

1. Episode Order: A lot of people have complained that the booklet & cases for Seasons 3&4 don't match the dvds. Here's the reasons: The booklet and cases are correct. The episodes were aired out of order. The dvds show them by order of the original air-date, even though they backtrack and skip around. Hopefully this error will be fixed for the individual releases down the road.

2. Color errors: I've seen several complaints about this, but I can't help but laugh. Color errors where you see the seekers in one-anothers' schemes & such, have been present since the original releases, to fix them would require editing the masters. This also goes for voice errors and wrong bots appearing during scenes.

3. I understand a lot of people wishing the movie was released with this set, but I would rather have had the ""Scramble City"" episode included with the Season 2 special features in its original Japanese dub. The fan commentary on the version included with most recent release of the movie, is down right annoying.

4. If you don't mind paying a little more, get the individual releases as they come out. The artwork is more colorful & the cases more durable, and as I said earlier, maybe the episode order will be corrected on these.",1260921600,3,1474,4.636015325670498
7770568,3,B01GWCMWQO,"I'd rate the series itself a 5, but the production at a 3.  Shout! Factory did a great job of video restoration and enhancement, but its audio was done horribly.  In many episodes the sound effects are at a mere whisper.  How annoying!  Even the Rhino releases were superior in the sense that the audio quality was consistent.  I wish the Sony DVD video division had released the series rather than go out of business.  They did an awesome job with the Transformers the Movie 20th Anniversary edition and I'm sure they would've done just as excellent a job with releasing this series.",1260576000,,584,4.621359223300971

7770573,4,B01GWCMWQO,"I'm a big Transformers fan but passed on the Kid Rhino dvd collection awhile back because of price and unecessary ""adjustments"" to the show.  I had gotten two dvd packs of G.I. Joe from Kid Rhino previously and didn't like the changes at all, since they tend to distract rather than enhance the show.  Shout Factory has provided an uncut and beautiful collection.  There are only a couple negatives that I can find in these dvds.

First, the severe lack of extras dissappoints me greatly.  There are extras, but not on a level that you'd expect from a full series release box set.  Only a hand full of things are offered.  What I was really excited about was the commercials and PSAs.  Unfortunately there are only 4 commercials, and all of them are from the later years of Transformers (Headmasters, etc.)  I'm very saddened that this is all they provide.  By the way, there are 2 PSA's.  I'm not sure why they decided to grant entirely separate sections for these 15 second clips.  Again, very dissappointing.

Second, there are scenes that look brand spanking new (from the cleanup), then there are scenes that look aged and blurry.  I didn't notice at first but there are a few episodes where the switch occurs every so often and becomes noticeable.  I'm assuming these scenes were not available for repair when Shout Factory was putting together this set.  However, a big positive is the audio.  Sound was sometimes a problem during Hasbro cartoons, for example sound effects would be at whisper volume and were obvious mistakes.  The audio, from the dozen episodes I've seen so far on these dvds, is fantastic.  I'm not sure if Shout Factory fixed the problems or what but it's great.

Anyways, overall this is a fantastic set.  It's all you really need if you're a fan of the show",1256342400,3,1787,4.681672025723473
7770574,5,B01GWCMWQO,"I bought this early in the summer directly from Shout Factory.  This set completely outdoes the Rhino DVDs [Optimus Prime style]. YouTube user Zaranyzerak (who is an expert in DVDs and Transformers) will confirm just how fantastic a DVD set can be POSSIBLE.  Keep in mind in post-production this series was mastered on video so expecting HD pristine picture will have to look elsewhere.  A lot of people have complained about the price of this set.  If you compare the price of all 5 Rhino sets new, factory sealed it will probably be around $300 minimum where the Shout Factory set is half of that ($150 if you can't do the math) and you do get better quality.  This really is the definitive set of the Transformers.  If you're a fan THIS IS IT!",1255824000,2,746,4.529850746268656
7770575,3,B01GWCMWQO,"Despite being one of the most popular cartoons of the '80s, The Transformers has had an awful time on DVD. The initial DVDs of The Ultimate Doom (released alongside the then-rare ""Rebirth"" three-parter on single-disc DVDs) had a pressing error which resulted in a batch of the discs including the ""Rebirth"" three-parter instead. However, the problems really started when Rhino decided to remaster the series by going back to the original 35mm negatives. Those 35mm reels were incomplete, however: every re-take in the series was not present, forcing Rhino to insert the footage from whatever sources were available. Rhino, was not perfect, however, (far from it, in fact), and many scenes were left uncorrected, and others had poor attempts to digitally alter the 35mm footage to match the broadcast masters. The famous transition sequences even had to be re-inserted in the first four episodes, and a great many were of the incorrect type. Adding insult to injury, the new 5.1 sound mix had added effects, and a great number of episodes from the first two seasons did not have the unaltered audio available (and the company responsible, Magno Sound, lied to everyone about the new effects, even after fans identified sounds from Star Trek: The Next Generation, which first aired as The Transformers entered into the land of perpetual reruns).

So, now, leading up to the 25th Anniversary of the fabled animated series, Hasbro assigned home video rights to Shout! Factory, which promptly declared that they would be fixing Rhino's mistakes. The mono mix has returned, lightly stereo-ized but without Magno's alterations (though some episodes, such as The Ultimate Doom Part 3, have reverted from a stronger mix of the effects and music tracks of the Rhino DVDs to the muted mixes that were created in the '80s). And true to their word, Shout! has fixed may of the problems with the prior DVDs. However, there are still a great many errors present, especially in the first season (which was the most problematic of Rhino's releases).

Among the things that are still uncorrected:
-Incorrect transitions in the second and third parts of the ""More Than Meets the Eye"" three parter
-Rampant amounts of incorrect footage in the recaps and previews for many of the multipart episodes
-Numerous shots of missing snowfall in the opening scene of ""Fire in the Sky""
-A handful of mis-framed shots in ""Divide and Conquer"" and ""SOS Dinobots"" (the former episode as the Autobots transform to meet Prime at the weapons factory, and during the battle with the mindless Dinobots in the latter episode)
-Starscream colored as Thundercracker at 15:33 of ""Fire on the Mountain"" and 2:15 of The Ultimate Doom Part 2
-The missing background as the Energon Cubes explode at the climax of The Ultimate Doom Part 3
-Rhino's digital tinkering to fix the 35mm footage of Wheeljack and his Shock Blast Cannon in ""Heavy Metal War""
-Lava which moves *up* Megatron's face (and gets in his eye) in the last shot of ""Heavy Metal War""
-The mis-titled title card for ""The Master Builders"" (titled ""The Master Builder"" on the DVD)
-The *correct* spelling of the word ""Decepticon"" in the title card of ""A Deceptacon Raider in King Arthur's Court""
-Missing freeze-frames at the end of two episodes: ""Auto Berserk"" and ""Revenge of Bruticus""
-Incorrect openings for all five parts of Season 3's ""Five Face of Darkness"": Only parts 3 and 5 have the correct video, and unlike the prior Rhino DVDs, the audio is from the normal opening in both parts.
-""Dark Awakening"", which was altered so as to precede ""The Return of Optimus Prime"", features only the audio from the original airing (which did not feature Victor Caroli's famous narration). In this era of DVD branching, it seems a bit silly that both versions were not able to appear on the same disc (what with the historical significance of the alternate version).

To be fair, the episodes are much improved. ""Heavy Metal War"", rendered nearly unwatchable on the Rhino DVDs, has only 19 incorrect shots, which is a significant reduction (and many of the differences are rather subtle in those 19 shots). Other episodes with are even more successfully corrected, such as a few seconds of black on Rhino's ""Desertion of the Dinobots"" Part 1 and the upholding of ""War Dawn's"" notoriously slowed-down Act 2 (done to cover up the removal of the original-and far more gruesome-crippling of Orion Pax from the final episode). [EDIT: Further investigation by yours truly reveals that the second act of ""War Dawn"" is still played at the wrong speed-only the voices have been corrected.] Also, the extras are very good, featuring a great number of commercials, an excellent cast reunion, and a conversation with Bob Budiansky that's infinitely better at illustrating his importance to the series than the similar one with Larry Hama that's featured in Shout! Factory's G.I. Joe set. I do, however, find the lack of participation from David Wise (who was at least as important as Flint Dille and Earl Kress, who were re-interviewed for this set, to the series) a bit disconcerting. Also, due to Hasbro's orders, the running order for Season 3 does not match the running order on the packaging of the version of this set offered directly by Shout! Factory as of this writing. However, it is the continued insistence on using the flawed 35mm masters (and not the broadcast masters) that causes the greatest concern with this set, especially when broadcast masters are used on 5 episodes (Season 1's ""Countdown to Extinction"", Season 3's ""The Burden Hardest to Bear"", and all three parts of ""The Rebirth""), just as they were on the Rhino DVDs, and they look pretty good for their age (and the inconsistency of Sunbow's telecine transfers). Until a more even-handed approach is taken, it's hard to recommend such an expensive DVD box set.",1255046400,80,5837,4.966257668711656

After reading all the reviews I expected it to be better than the quality used to be played on TV.. i get that it is a very old series, and I understand they put a lot of effort to make it good.

8764040,5,B01GWCMWQO,For one thing the case makes a very nice display piece on the Shelf. The concept is good. Its a good way to commemorate the 25th anniversary of transformers. But the neat thing is how the box is opened. Pulling the matrix apart revealing the middle. Inside are the disc jackets. Four jackets containing about 8 discs. And a booklet of the episode guides. Summarizing each episode.  The only draw back is that season 4 ends with Rebirth so technically the Transformers series is Three Seasons. And the movie is not included in the set. The beginning of season 3. A 5 part mini series Five Faces of darkness picks up directly from where the movie ends. I liked season three a lot. Thats one part of transformers I can watch many times. There were a lot of popular episodes in the series.  Season three brings back memories of my days in high school because i watched after school. when i came home. Its more nostalgia for me.
