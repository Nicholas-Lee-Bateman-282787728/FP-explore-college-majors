8418658,5,B0048EZZ40,"enjoyed beck when it aired on mhz tv.  was thrilled to see they continued with beck 25, 26.  this latest series doesn't disappoint.  it is just as fast paced and exciting.  love beck and gunvald, they are a great team.  for the record, here is the list of the latest beck shows:  #25 stormens oga, #26 levande begravd, #27 rum 302, #28 famijen, #29 invasionen, #30 sjukhusmorden.  numbers 27-30 do not come with english subtitles and i don't know if they will ever be offered.  it seems a shame when the english speaking audience has been faithful fans of the show.  last time i was on amazon u.k. they weren't available for shipment to the united states.

update:  9/16/16  ... mhz advertised there is a new beck series without gunvald.  ordered it on amazon uk as a preorder.  mhz hasn't offered #27-30 so don't believe it will ever be available with english subtitles which is a shame..

update:  10/4/16.........mhz is now offering episodes 25-34 with 30% discount.  don't know if this includes the new beck volume 2 on amazon's u.k. page, but think it might.",1456790400,2,1063,4.65945945945946

8418662,5,B0048EZZ40,"I've had the opportunity in the last several years to watch close to ten different Scandinavian crime series and have yet to be disappointed by any of them.  Having viewed all 26 episodes of Beck that were made between 1997 and 2010, I would rank it among the best of those I have viewed.

Peter Haber as the eponymous character and Mikael Persbrandt as Beck's righthand man Gunvald Larsson both did an exceptional job portraying interesting complex characters.  The series did a good job playing off the contrasting personalities, appearances, behaviors, and mindsets of these two men.  Kudos also to Ingvar Hirdwall whose brief appearances as Grannen, Martin Beck's quirky (that's an understatement) neighbor brought comic relief to each episode.

A crime show is heavily dependent on the cases its characters must solve, and in Beck, the cases were often compelling with unexpected and at times shocking twists and turns that kept Beck and company unsure of who the perpetrator was until the very end.

Very highly recommended.",1391904000,,1030,5.101190476190476

8418664,5,B0048EZZ40,Generally when a series finishes there is a sadness but with series I feel left wanting. I wanted it just to continue on and on.,1380758400,2,128,4.16
8418665,5,B0048EZZ40,Every new Martin Beck and Gunvald mystery keep your attention clearly focused on the DVD. Outstanding characters that you almost feel you know well enough to call their next action ... but you don't. Side characters you find yourself waiting for their next appearance...
