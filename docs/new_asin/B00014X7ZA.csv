8006610,2,B00014X7ZA,"This DVD doesn't look professional. Cheap camera work combined with ok (at best) music make this DVD a mildly entertaining 40 minutes. The sequencing is choppy, cutting between different scenes, it really doesn't flow well. There are maybe a total of 10 girls dancing in this DVD. I bought it so I could play it in the background on mute when I spin at parties, but this is not the right DVD for that. The music in this DVD doesn't match the dancing, and since the girls aren't professionals, the dancing itself is pretty awful. If you want to see girls dancing to techno music, go to a club. The last ten minutes of the DVD are a lame interview with some unknown DJ, which is totally pointless.",1139529600,6,695,4.4375
