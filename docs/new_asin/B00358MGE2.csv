8388772,1,B00358MGE2,"I rarely offer up a 1 star rating, but this movie was just awful.  Poor characterizations; trite, seen-it-before-a-million-time boring.  Poor plot, more like a spoof, than a dramatic thriller..  Each character was hollow, especially Dean Cain... Oh my, no acting like Brad Pitt  in this film.",1423612800,,292,5.282608695652174
8388773,5,B00358MGE2,"Super suspenseful movie, Dean Cain at his best.  Highly recommend.",1423180800,,66,5.6
8388774,5,B00358MGE2,"I have always followed this actors films & this rates as one of his best.
The intrigue in this film from start to finish, kept me watching.
I would recommend this film to anybody who likes a bit of detective work
espionage & suspense all rolled into one.
My opinion, Dean is well cast the snoopy reporter, Dan Kovacs trying
to unravel the murder of his brother while staying alive long enough to
solve it. Won't be the last time I watch it.",1378252800,,440,4.313253012048193
8388775,5,B00358MGE2,This movie is an awesome movie.  The intrigue and mystery surrounding Daniel's brothers death kept you guessing as to who was behind it.  It went higher up than you might expect.  It makes you think just exactly what is really going on in the organizations that we trust with our lives every day.  It's fast moving and suspenseful.  Dean Cain did a fantastic job.  It's worth your time.,1362096000,,386,4.602941176470588
8388776,5,B00358MGE2,Dean Cain shows  that he is  the action hero in this film.  When his brother is killed while researching a story Dean Cain's character finds himself taks with the  job of unearthing the truth.  His able to think  on his feet and save the day. The action is non stop.,1322265600,,266,4.22
8388777,3,B00358MGE2,"I'm a fan of Dean Cain's low budget action stuff (""Phase IV,"" ""Breakaway,"" ""Firetrap"") because you can usually count on clear cut heroes and villians. This one feels a little murky, however. It's well produced and does have suspense, but could use a little more action and a little less talking. All in all, a good film, but not one that i will want to watch multiple times.",1298246400,,374,4.514705882352941
8388778,5,B00358MGE2,"The movie was absolutely brilliant. Dean Cain can act really good. He should be major movies. I think he's better than most actors today. He should be as famous as Brad Pitt. Once again, Great movie.",1275264000,5,199,4.555555555555555
8388779,4,B00358MGE2,The movie is interesting. The lead character has no idea what his brother has gotten into as far as being a cop is involved until he as a journalist has to go undercover to solve his murder until he uncovers a plot of espionage behind the Chinese curtain. Lots of Car chases and government curruption in this movie.,1260230400,,315,4.448275862068965
