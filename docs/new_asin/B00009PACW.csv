7992230,5,B00009PACW,"This is not an NTSC format DVD. It won't play on my DVD players. I was able to get it to play on one of my PC's that runs Windows Vista but not my PC with Windows XP.  Amazon states that it is NTSC format for all regions but it says PAL format on the back of the box.  You can buy an all region DVD player, but after reading the reviews on the inexpensive players I decided not to purchase one.

I give it five stars since I love Westlife and this is a great DVD if you want to see them as a young 5 member group.

Their DVD ""10 Years of Westlife - Live at Croake Park"" is sold in NTSC format and will play on U.S. DVD players and I highly recomend it to anyone interested in Westlife.",1291420800,2,685,3.8028169014084505
