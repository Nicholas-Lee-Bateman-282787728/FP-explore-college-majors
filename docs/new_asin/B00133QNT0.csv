8249076,4,B00133QNT0,Hilarious.  Been watching all the Todd Verow movies one by one.  This def does not disappoint.  The lines all were spoken so funny.  How did they all say them without busting up?  Very enjoyable movie.  Todd looks so great and very well built!,1508198400,,243,4.534883720930233
8249077,3,B00133QNT0,I regretted buying this movie. Not much to say or write about.,1485216000,2,62,4.25
8249078,5,B00133QNT0,"Todd Verow is a genius and I got this via Netflix and then immediately bought it on here bc it is sooo gorgeously subversive, intelligent, funny, crazy sexy and a gorgeous postmodern reinterpretation of a classic. My friends saw it at a film festival in Europe and raved. Verow is bold, unflinching dedicated to his craft, unafraid to stir up controversy, and take impressive risks. I am a huge fan and did I mention all the hot men and that sexy blond twink. You must order this and have your mind blown.",1475193600,,505,4.5

8249081,1,B00133QNT0,"What a creepy something (sorry, it doesn't deserve to be called ""a movie"").
I would like to learn the IQ of people who stand behind this ""project"". How unimaginative one must be to create such dreary picture.
Where is sense in all that bull*#*#*??? The dialogues are nothing. Just like acting and direction. Even the ""sex"" scenes made me laugh loud!!!
Check so called ""first lady"" - this is a true proof how stupid it is. She is twice as old as her ""husband"" - Mr. President. And all the viewers must believe that they are a married couple...HA HA HA!",1308009600,,551,4.465346534653466
8249082,1,B00133QNT0,This was like watching paint dry on the wall it was that boring and bad...Sex scenes not that good and the guys were not attractive at all...,1268956800,,141,4.2592592592592595
8249083,4,B00133QNT0,"Welcome to Politics 101.  Presented in an almost tutorial format, the ""behind"" of the scenes (pun intended) being our own Fearless Leader, is the perfect ""butt"" (yeah, another pun)for a fascinating storyline.

In addition to the gut-level satire, I really enjoyed the male frontal nudity, bordering on the extremes of soft porn, only inches away from hardcore (that pun was intended too).

All an audience needs to have to enjoy this film is a slightly off-centered sense of humor leaning toward the appreciation of dark comedy/satire and a decent imagination, willing to accept the absurd.

If the President or Bulldog need to sit down and relax...  My face is always available.",1264032000,5,679,5.081081081081081
8249084,1,B00133QNT0,"French writer Chaderlos de Laclos' ""Les Liaisons Dangerous"" is a brilliant masterpiece of moral curruption and sexual gamemanship. To date over 10 adaptations of his 1782 literary work have been brought to film, the most notable being Roger Vadim's ""Les Liaisons Dangerous,"" Stephen Frears' ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" Milos Forman's ""Valmont,""  Roger Kumbel's ""Cruel Intentions,"" and E J-Young's ""Untold Scandal.""

To his credit, creator and star Todd Verow has taste in his source material. To his discredit, he has no other noticeable cinematic talent. A low budget is not a necessary impediment to a good film, Luis Bunuel did wonders with very little money for years, and any Independent film festival usually produces a few gems through the rubble. However, I was really stunned when I saw the first scene of ""Bulldog in the Whitehouse.""  My incredulity stayed with me to the last scene. Yes, I saw all of it. Ugh! I can appreciate Mr. Verow's desire to skewer the soon-to-be ex-President G. W. Bush's reprehensible mismanagement of our country. However, his story, very loosely taken from the Laclos' novel, is badly filmed. Like the cartoon ""Lil Bush Resident of the United States"" this Bulldog lunges at your throat and gags the viewer, rather than entertain with smart writing or interesting sight gags.

The handheld camcorder is positioned in an extreme closeup throughout every scene. Virtually no sets are used, just uncomfortable tight closeups of ""actor's"" faces as verbal bile spews from their mouths. Viewing this DVD is an experience, to be sure, but whatever hopes I had of a passable satire of politics decorated with Laclos' superb psychological insights and cultural observations were smashed like the video camera is to the actor's faces.

Todd Verow has an interesting look, and a good body, but his expression rarely changes from a blank look,and when he smiles he doesn't look like someone you'd want to sit next to in public, much less enter your bedroom. His voice is so tiny and without nuance he looks like he's just trying to memorize the lines he wrote. There's no feeling to anything he does. Verow's one good scene has more to do with handsome,young Bryan Safi as President Bush's even stupider doubleganger. Bulldog (Verow) steals into the boytoy president's bed and rapes him, while seducing the pres. into wanting Bulldog to come back for more. It's a creepy scene, but Safi really acts like he's being violated. Verow's passive expression makes him appear robatic and alien in this most intimate of acts.

To be fair, one other plus in ""Bulldog in the Whitehouse""s favor is Gail Dennison as a First Lady prototype. She's sweetly maternal with a psychotic mean streak that occasionally flares up. Ms. Dennison is wacky and entertaining. The most interesting irony of this DVD is although it is homoerotic with a capital ""H"", a matronly actress rivals a sex scene for being the most memorable aspect of this video.",1210636800,10,2945,5.036960985626283
