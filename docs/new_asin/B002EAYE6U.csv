3916559,5,B002EAYE6U,"This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no extra features and no restoration done specifically for this release. There are no chapter stops. You can go forwards and backwards in ten minute increments only. My five star rating is for the quality of the product and the film, not the wisdom of paying this specific price.

This movie is best known in film history as the basis for the Three Stooges' comedy short ""Men in Black"", although there is really no comparison between the two. This is a well-paced little hospital drama made right before the production code began to be enforced. Dr. George Forrest (Clark Gable) is an intern at a busy hospital and Laura Hudson (Myrna Loy) is his socialite fiancee. Forrest wants to study under Dr. Hochberg (Jean Hersholt) when his time is up as an intern, but it means only twenty dollars a week and long indefinite hours. Laura wants her fiancee to go into private practice so that they can have a normal life together after their marriage. Laura may be a bit of a spoiled brat, but she knows it, so it makes her more likeable. Forrest is torn between wanting to please Laura and wanting the great chance to work with Hochberg. A fight between the couple one night sets up the scene for a scandal that has the opportunity to derail both Forrest's career and personal life. That is pretty much the crux of the movie.

What keeps it interesting is the pacing and the performances. I found it to be the most believable of the Gable/Loy pairings I've seen. Plus, unlike so many MGM dramas of the 30's, there is no unreasonable bad guy in sight other than the fight to advance medicine. Another matter of interest is the art deco interior design of the hospital. For example, there is a staircase in the main lobby of the hospital that is out of this world.

Both the video and audio quality of this film are excellent. It looks like it was being readied for a pressed DVD release even if the manufacturer says otherwise. I'd highly recommend this product to fans of precode film and of either Clark Gable or Myrna Loy.",1249776000,9,2070,4.514666666666667
8367201,3,B002EAYE6U,"Much slower than I thought it would be and, (spoiler) although about abortion in one area, had I not already known about it the movie is too vague to let one know that. The limited medical resources and practices at the time was interesting to me as I am a nurse and like the history of medicine.",1490745600,,296,4.2105263157894735
8367202,4,B002EAYE6U,"In this 1934 film, Clark Gable gave a forceful performance as a dedicated surgeon in a hospital saving lives and doing basic research. Starring with Myrna Loy in the lead role as his wife, but in love with a coworker played by the beautiful Elizabeth Allan, questions the traditional family values in the pre-code era movies. Jean Hersholt gives a good performance as his mentor and a veteran at the hospital. The film also include Otto Kruger, Wallace Ford and Samuel Hinds. Monta Bell produced this film based on a play by Sidney Kingsley. The success of this movie gave MGM Studios a penchant for hospital doctor stories. Recommended to all the fans of pre-code movies, Clark Gable, and Myrna Loy.",1482019200,,700,4.793388429752066

8367205,4,B002EAYE6U,"In most ways a routine medical melodrama, MGM's 'Men in White' (1934) manages to combine romance, hospital politics and the rigors of the daily lives of doctors and nurses with reasonable efficiency, elevated by high production values and earnest performances from both the lead and supporting cast.  Unfortunately the weakest component of the story is the Gable-Loy relationship, the fate of which is telegraphed clearly from the couple's first appearance together in the film, but it's a relatively minor deficiency in an otherwise polished pre-code tearjerker.  Warner Archive's DVD-R offers a remarkably clean print with almost no evidence of age-related wear; there is, however, a fair amount of hissing and crackling on the audio track, although it rarely interferes with the clarity of the dialogue.  No extras.  Movie rates 3-plus stars, presentation 4.",1409011200,,861,5.451127819548872

8367207,5,B002EAYE6U,This is a great tool to talk to kids who are bombarded every day about their identity in life. Who are they? What is their purpose in life? Why are they here? Are the fossil records correct? Why is there not more salt on the earth if we are supposed to be billions of years old? These are great questions explored and allows viewers to ponder both sides of the conversation. A must watch and must have for families.,1372032000,,415,4.265822784810126

8367209,5,B002EAYE6U,"This 1934 Hospital Melodrama is the ""granddaddy"" precusor of MGM's successful ""Dr Kildare"" series of the 1930s and 40s and the 1960s and 70s TV series ""Ben Casey"", ""Dr Kildare"" and ""Marcus Welby M.D"". It has all the basic plot strains - the idealistic, talented, driven young intern, Doctor George Ferguson {Clark Gable} who is being mentored, goaded and pushed to his limits by senior staff Doctor Hochbury {Jean Hersholt} to the exclusion in Dr. Ferguson's life of anything but medicine and training.

Fergurson is a talent and Hochbury's focus is to make him a great and totally dedicated doctor. The movie pulls no punches -the interns pay is wretched {20 dollars a week for 100 + hours}, the overwork stretchs into weeks with no time off, the food served in the hospital cafateria is awfull and the young interns ""have needs"" which harsh medical training ,little sleep and Doctor Hochbery's exhortations on the nobility of doctors and  the medical profession cannot help them with !!!

Toss in Laura {Myrna Loy} Dr. Fergurson's rich, society girl fiance' wanting marriage, an idealic honeymoon in Vienna and wheedling him to chuck the hospital for a cushy spot in a thriving Park Avenue practice and this is one interesting ""stewpot"" of a film.

The hospital set {by Art Director Cedric Gibbons} is pure 1930's art deco, impossibly clean wide corridors gleaming walls, polished floors /rooms , bells /flashing signs on every wall {that work !!} and the starched, immaculate whites worn by the hospital staff all which mark this as a typical high quality MGM production and it looks great !! The strong supporting cast includes wise-cracking, perpetually hungry and horny interns ""Shorty"" {Wallace Ford} and 'Michaelson"" {Russell Hardie}, beautifull Elizabeth Allan {Nurse Barbara} and veteran characther actors C.Henry Gordon, Henry B. Walthall and Otto Kruger all playing old -line doctors with their own private issues /demons.

The snappy dialouge between the interns espisically concerning ""female companionship"" automatically marks this as a pre-code movie - the Joseph Breen production code would not come into force until later in 1934. The film storyline also includes an astonishingly frank scene when in the course of a major plot revelation the principle players all but directly state that a hospital staffer's death {after an unsuccessful emergency operation} its cause being due to a botched abortion she had. Even for a pre-code movie this suggestion of an abortion was quite daring in 1934 !!

Jean Hersholt is outstanding as ""Hockie"" driven, focused, kindly, dedicated to his profession and to George his surrogate son. Myrna Loy gives a nice performance as a women in love, yearning for her man, mariage,love and because she has  her own ""needs"". As it is, George is so busy, at one point she complains to her father that she hasn't kissed him in days !! But it is Clark Gable who dominates the movie and this is by far the best acting job of his young 4 year career. At 32 years old he is at his physical peak, murderously handsome, virile and completely attuned to his characther. He gives a sensitive and nuanced performance and he is particularily excellent in his inter-action scenes with a diabetic/sick little girl.

There is an interesting scene early in the movie with George and Laura are discussing how much they are looking forward to their honey-moon in Vienna and then ""Hockie"" moves into the frame delibertaly standing between them and proceeding pouring cold water on Laura's plans by stating how hard George will have to work while attending medical school in Vienna. This is the classic movie ""triangle"" but untypically instead of two women fighting for George's affection ""the ""eternal triangle conflict' is between Laura and ""Hockie"" competing for George's love, loyalty and {in effect} his soul !! I really liked this movie a lot, it has a compelling storyline, great production values and an outstanding cast all giving of their best. A five [5] star movie - Highly Recommended.",1332288000,2,4023,5.048192771084337

Henry Gordon, Russell Hardie, Wallace Ford, Henry B. Walthall, Russell Hopton, Samuel S. Hinds, Frank Puglia, Leo Chalzel

Directed by Richard Boleslawski

There's a muted fantasy aspect about this film, and there are cinematic statements, made through symbols, that remind one of ""Citizen Kane"".  Richard Boleslawski has been greatly overlooked as a stylist, and Gable as a real actor, before he became crusted over. There's a scene, where he rips a hypodermic needle from the hands of an incompetent doctor, that really works well.  ""Men in White"" is a filmed play, done so convincingly that even a cynical viewer can be persuaded to judge the medical profession as one of honor.

Clark Gable could really act (pre-GWTW) gives a super performance and Myrna Loy never looked lovelier, delivering  a good performance herself.

Richard Boleslawski knew what to do with a camera.

Jean Hersholt perhaps best remembered as the embittered but deeply caring grandfather of Shirley Temple in the beloved Heidi (1937).

* Special Footnote: -- Shot in fifteen days. Clark Gable was assigned to this film right after completing It Happened One Night, and was then immediately sent to New York once this film rapped so he could do promotional work for Capra's film.

** Another Special Footnote: --  Because of the suggested illicit romance and the suggested abortion in the movie, it was frequently cut. The Legion of Decency cited the movie as unfit for public exhibition.
