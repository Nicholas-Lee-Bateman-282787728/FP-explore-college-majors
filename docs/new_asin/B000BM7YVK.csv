2423632,3,B000BM7YVK,great guitar licks but I personally would have preferred some more instruction as to how the Chicken Picking worked and which fingers to use.,1362441600,,141,4.916666666666667
2423633,5,B000BM7YVK,"James Burton is one of the greatest guitar players, ever. A lot of players play differently, perhaps music you like better (Wes Montgomery, Howard Roberts, Lightening Hopkins, Albert King, Steve Cropper, Eric Clapton, to name a few) but none are technically better than Burton.  This DVD is a great way to see what he is doing, and have him explain a lot of it to you, but playing music takes an ear and complicated muscle actions and nobody can tell you exactly how to do many of the ""tricks"" Burton shows. He can touch string and make it sing, and he knows chords, scales, and every note on the neck of a guitar. He takes basic triad, makes the 5 a 6, and then pushes his pinky down the B string until is a 7. The lesson is not long enough to explain all of what he knows, so you may not get everything the first time (or the third) you watch the lesson. One trick you can pick up right away, is that while he letting a last chord ring, he puts the index finger of his right (pick) hand on the low E string and slides it down, adding an interesting sound.  You can learn that the first time you see it (he just does it, he does not tell you what note to start or stop on), but most of what he does takes weeks of practice.

Burton is not a great teacher, but no great teacher can play like he does. The cost is about that of a single half hour lesson, but much more than twice as good. If you look at the video, watch his hands, and try to make the same sounds, you will get better.  James did not have lessons this good and he figured it out, by picking some notes and then learning the ones that sound correct.  Nothing he does can be learned in a day, a week, month or several months. He played for about 10 years before he sounded anything like this. You can't learn faster than he did, or you are a better guitar player (just kidding, no one is).  A great video to see James in action, likely the best, is the Roy Orbison  Black and White Night. http://www.amazon.com/Roy-Orbison-Black-White-Night/dp/B0000203YR
The Amazon description mentions ""Tom Waits, and Jennifer Warnes"" but does not list James Burton (one reviewer mentions the legendary ""Steve Burton"" - not to sure about that), but Burton is the star of the show, better (but with a smaller part) than Orbison and and Springsteen (who is surprisingly good).

In this video, Burton shows a whole lot of stuff he wishes someone had shown him. You can't learn it in one day, but neither did he. If you practice, you will figure it out; if you don't, you won't.

N.B. One reviewer mentioned that James is (like Chet Atkins) a finger picker. You can make much the same sound without finger picking, but you can not make the same sound, or be nearly so fast if you don't, and, as that reviewer pointed out, finger picking is another skill that takes a lot of practice (not days) to learn.

An extra to learning some of his techniques is long bit on chord changes on the top four strings that he used on ""Too Far Gone"" with Emmylou Harris.  Really pretty and he does most of the parts you would need to do the whole song. It is slow and it works beautifully, so speed is not the only trick in his bag.

You can't get everything on one DVD, and if James wants to do another, I would like to see some the ""stabs"" or riffs  that he and Steve Cropper use to back up singers without knocking them over. Both of those guys are real pros at filling holes with  little bits that add a lot without being noticed. This DVD is mostly  about the guitar solos, but that is actually what they do for 12 measures or so, what they are so great at is putting the backing up makes singers sound good, and that takes just as much skill, it is almost like they are composers, adding horns or percussion (or even silence) to make the song stronger.

If you want to pick up some of the things Burton does, this is a great way to do so, and at much lower a cost than taking lessons to pick up the same things.",1346112000,,3945,4.233022636484687
2423634,4,B000BM7YVK,"I bought this video in attempt to be just as good country guitarist than I am a rock and blues guitarist (I also own the Eric Johnson video Total Electric Guitar). James' fingerstyle is NOT recommended for everybody that's used to using a straight pick and it requires precise practice and patience (I still have a lot to learn on this video). So far I've been able not only gain appreciation for Mr. Burton as a player, but also gain interest in country guitar far beyond the ""twang"" of his Tele. As far as actually learning his playing style, that's another story (So far...still straight pickin).",1322611200,,599,4.660377358490566
2423635,5,B000BM7YVK,This is a great video. Anyone looking to get into country playing or interested in James Burton needs to buy this video.,1320192000,,120,4.5
2423636,4,B000BM7YVK,"The DVD is great, especially the slow motion reviews of Burton's playing. The only gripe I have is with the tab booklet: IT IS TOO SMALL TO READ.",1288051200,,145,4.214285714285714
2423637,5,B000BM7YVK,This is not suited to be a beginner's first instructional DVD.  It is best for a person who knows of and appreciates James Burton's style and capability.  It is very good for one who wants to know how Burton accomplishes some of the effects unique to him.,1278374400,,255,4.404255319148936
2423638,2,B000BM7YVK,mr. burton fails to give fret numbers or notes in his demo which will be confusing to the beginning player.  Also he does not discuss in depth his muteing technique in detail and some fingering is hard to pick up.  If you have a good ear this video will be helpful as he is a very inventive player and has a style worth knowing.  I just hope any future videos will be more inclusive.  mark brinsfield,1251849600,,400,4.223684210526316
2423639,4,B000BM7YVK,"I remember Burton playing for Ricky Nelson and always liked his style.
This DVD does a good job.",1231891200,,96,4.388888888888889
2423640,3,B000BM7YVK,"This is really more of a demonstration video than an instructional video. Like many great players, Mr. Burton is not a guitar teacher, so you have to be ready to capture what you can from what he shows on the video. This DVD was originally released as VHS. The hot licks people added sections that slow down the examples so you'll have a chance to figure out what James is doing. I consider it a good resource that I will go back to over time, but not really a how-to guide. I recommend viewing this in a player or on a computer that will allow you to do your own slow-down and repeats.",1231632000,,586,4.1946902654867255
2423641,5,B000BM7YVK,This guy developed a style and technique that not only has been a foundation for generations of guitar slingers that followed but is still an inspiration today. The cat can just play! The next best thing to a few private lessons. Highly recommended.,1184976000,,249,4.813953488372093
2423642,5,B000BM7YVK,"James plays over chords and his chording style is different, which gives him a pretty unique sound. If you want some rockabilly licks, this is probably the best place to get them... and he's got everything in slow motion at the end of the DVD. I'm having a ball picking up on this stuff.

Great!",1184371200,,295,4.363636363636363
2423643,4,B000BM7YVK,"This one is for musicians and I enjoyed every minute of it. James demonstrates some of his more famous riffs and, for many of them, it was interesting (depressing)that for all these years, I have not been playing them properly.

What a great sound from the guitar and his style is unmistakable - there are some really great licks to be had from this if you like country rock.

One dissapointment - he did not demonstrate Johnny B Goode, which is one my all time favorites.",1182816000,,472,4.476744186046512
2423644,4,B000BM7YVK,"I enjoyed it a lot, learned a few things. I'm an experienced player so I understood it. Definitely for a player who wants to try a new style.",1170374400,,141,4.071428571428571
2423645,5,B000BM7YVK,"James Burton is a true legend and in this video proves to be a great teacher as well. This is one of my favorite instructional guitar videos because of the easy going pace and extremely good close-ups of Burton's left and right hands. He uses finger picks and it is relatively easy to see how he does everthing. From Suzy Q, Hello Mary Lou, Traveling Man etc solos to general techniques, he takes you through quite a beautiful trip. He talks about his early days (he wrote and recorded Suzy Q in his teens) and drops insider, informative comments about playing with Ricky Nelson and Elvis- specifcally how he approached the sounds he was looking for in their recordings. He shows how he gets the ""echo"" effects heard on Nelson's recordings without any pedals or guitar effects. (Heck, there weren't any effects pedals in 1958). This is just the tip of the iceberg. It's kind of thrilling to watch him play such classic stuff like the solo in ""Fools Rush In"".

The slow-motion section is just excellent. Kudos to Hot Licks for adding these sections to their DVD editions.

At the end, he shows off his ""new"" Fender signature paisley Telecaster with the chicken-picken style (which I think Burton practically invented). You can't go wrong adding this one to your collection.",1151280000,,1272,4.751131221719457
8088733,4,B000BM7YVK,"It's an educational disc and not one that features solo performances, which is what I was looking for. I saw him do a solo with Roy Orbison, playing
Pretty Woman; it's phenomenal. Bruce Springsteen was also doing a solo with him but he simply could not meet up with Burton, as there was just
no competition in my opinion. That  was what I was looking for.",1505088000,,355,4.378787878787879

8088735,5,B000BM7YVK,"Great demistrations of well known guitar leads, especially those of Rick Nelson's recordings.",1487289600,,93,6.230769230769231
8088736,3,B000BM7YVK,"I love James Burton, but if you're expecting anything more than him playing a few licks from a few songs, you might want to go elsewhere for actual instruction on learning his style and how to play his songs/licks.  Sure YOU can do a lot of work and learn some licks/solos from this if you rewind/pause like crazy, but James could have easily TAUGHT a bit more instead of just playing this and that a bit.  This is NOT, I repeat NOT a sit down and show you how to play songs/licks/solos or even ""my style"" DVD.  It's simply James sitting down, telling SUPER short info about certain songs (things like, ""this is from such and such a song which I played on so and so's recording""... and that's about it for the most part), and then him playing a lick/solo or two from those songs one, two, and sometimes three times (once or twice at regular aka FAST speed and then sometimes again at a slower speed that's still WAY too fast for most mortal students who aren't already chicken pickin' masters).  If you go into this one thinking it's going to be like most instructional videos where they actually break down the licks and show you exactly how to do it, you'll probably be VERY disappointed.  It honestly doesn't do that (again, unless you're at a level where you can just watch somebody play and pick it up instantly OR if you don't mind rewinding/pausing like crazy just to learn a handful of licks that are taught better elsewhere).  Still, if you're a fan, this DVD definitely does still have merit.  It's almost like having him in your living room widdling away on the guitar just for you for 44 minutes (yes, it's very short for an instructional DVD which is another minus).  So, if you go into it with the mindset of it being a chance to have James sitting in your living room, shyly telling a little bit about a few songs, and playing some super cool guitar riffs/licks (and he does briefly talk a LITTLE bit about how he didn't know certain sounds were done with effects and how he learned to mimick them using ghost notes and chicken' pickin' clicks) then you'll walk away very happy. It kind of felt like, ""this is what Ricky Nelson and Elvis must have witnessed"" with James right their noodling away.  I'm really surprised that this got such high ratings and believe that must be due to sheer idolotry of a genuine guitar hero.  He is indeed an inspiration and a guitar GIANT, but this particular DVD simply isn't what it portends to be, especially when compared to all the superb TRULY INSTRUCTION DVDs out there (I recommend checking out Lee Hodge's, Steve Trovato's, and Max Milligan's DVDs if you're looking for somebody showing/explaining this style and giving you note for note breakdowns so you can walk away being able to play James Burton style licks and songs with accuracy and confidence.  The online sites Guitar Tricks, Doug Seven, Power Twang, and Country Guitar Chops are also SUPERIOR places to learn from people who love classic country and are passionate about passing it on to you as much as possible via teaching you songs, techniques, licks, and all kinds of chops lessons you can use in James' songs and your own and those sites... and even their free youtube lessons... are much more recommended for what most probably wanted from this DVD).  As an instructional DVD, I give this one a 2 out of 5 stars for the advanced player.  As an inspirational/watch a legend sit down and play a few licks entertainment DVD, I give it a 3.5/5 (it could have been sooo much better in all departments: story telling, running time, practicality, planning, direction... it feels so unplanned as if James just stopped by and they told him to play some stuff and talk a little).  Just my honest personal thoughts as somebody who's watched too many lessons to count and who has played guitar for a VERY long time but who is only recently delving into the greatness that is classic country guitar.  So overall, I give this one a 3.  I'd LOVE to see a really in depth lesson series from James some day, but if this is his idea of how to do lessons, that ain't gonna happen.  Still love him like crazy, though!  Peace.",1473724800,,4130,4.5431266846361185
8088737,5,B000BM7YVK,"I loved watching this master play, explain his influences and show us some favorite licks. I also dug the fact that he didn't bore anyone with arcane explanations of chord substitutions, obscure scales or harmonics (except some ghostly Tele tones). James Burton, like fellow session greats Cornell Dupree, Teenie Hodges, Little Beaver and Grant Green, to name a few, is a genuine ""feel"" player, who has developed a unique and very personal style. Guitarists watching this vid should take the opportunity to learn how to slip a little Burton into their playing -- not slavishly copy something that is impossible to duplicate.",1447891200,,624,5.127450980392157

8088740,5,B000BM7YVK,James Burton is a living legend; it is wonderful to observe and learn his technique using pick and fingerstyle together.  I only wish it was longer and went into more detail of this truly great artist,1404172800,,200,4.555555555555555
8088741,5,B000BM7YVK,"James Burton's legacy speaks for itself, but this DVD gives guitar players a chance to hear the specifics and details of his legacy in his own words and with multiple, close-up camera angles.  James is humble and genuinely interested in helping the viewer understand and grasp the complexities of his genre shaping style.  He demonstrates specific, clear, detailed examples of signature songs which are instantly recognizable and offers ideas on how to make them your own.  James is clearly a brilliant musician's musician, but here he is genuinely concerned with passing on his knowledge, skill and musical intuition to the next generation of innovators.  He offers common-sense, practical advice and examples which can be integrated into our own playing right away.  Regardless of the musical style you are interested in, James provides plenty of food for thought.  This DVD should be in every musician's collection.  Start here.",1385856000,,931,5.292517006802721
8088742,5,B000BM7YVK,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to replace my copy on VHS.  James Burton, in addition to being one of the most influential guitar players of all time, can actually teach his style.  There are instructional videos from many great guitar players who cannot explain clearly what they do.  Mr. Burton has an easy laid back approach to explaining some of his classic solos such as ""Suzie Q,"" ""Travelin' Man,"" ""Hello Mary Lou"" and ""Fools Rush In"".  The DVD has a segment with slow motion with standard pitch sound.  There is a split screen where all right and left hand techniques are shown in close-up.  I highly recommend this.",1379721600,,626,4.6454545454545455
