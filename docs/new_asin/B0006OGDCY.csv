2190531,4,B0006OGDCY,"The TimeLife series of B&B episodes are not edited for content like the Mike Judge Collection. If you are a fan of this show, which I am, you will like this for what it is.
My only question is ""How can Beavis eat 100 candy bars and not turn into ""The Great Cornholio""? Cornholio existed long before the ""Candy Sale"" episode aired. I think the writers messed up there.",1252627200,2,367,4.333333333333333
2190532,5,B0006OGDCY,"This DVD contains one of the funniest Christmas episodes of any series ever.  It features a few Christmas music videos (Buster Poindexter's ""Zat You Santy Claus"" being my favorite) letters to Santa-Butthead, and two very Christmasy short cartoons.  In the first cartoon, Beavis dreams he's a Burger World boss and goes home on Christmas Eve to watch a porn entitled ""Ebenezer Screw"" starring Bob Scratchit and Tiny Johnson.  He's interrupted by three ghosts who tell him to change his ways.  When he wakes up from his dream and tells Butthead about it, Butthead seems most impressed with the porn.

In the second episode an angel shows Butthead a vision of how the world would be much better off without him.  The angel keeps clumsily falling into a river though, and Beavis and Butthead decide to just laugh at his drowning instead of giving him a helping hand.  The funniest part of this episode is when Butthead is beat up by a group of homeless people offscreen.

The letters to Santa-Butthead sequences are just as good as the cartoons, if not better.  When girls write saying they want Beavis for Christmas, Butthead doesn't understand why they're into ""buttwipes like that,"" but it doesn't seem to bother him too much since he still is able to laugh at names like ""Les Dickson.""

The Halloween collection is good too, but aside from the first out of the eight or so cartoons, it doesn't really have a Halloween feel to it.  At Halloween time, I find myself wanting to only watch the first cartoon, which has Beavis and Butthead trick-or-treating in lame Halloween costumes.  Butthead pours cheese on himself and says he's nachos, and Beavis puts underwear on his head saying he's a nad.  Beavis eats all of Mr. Anderson's Halloween candy (making Mr. Anderson understandably upset of course) and turns into Cornholio, wandering off into the night.

I highly recommend this DVD for the Christmas episode alone.  The other episodes on the collection are good too, even though most of them don't have much to do with Halloween.  I like the episode where they ring peoples' doorbells for fun but forget to run away.  It's hilarious seeing Beavis stand there for 20 seconds after the door opens, and then run away laughing.  Man, he's stupid.",1133222400,10,2243,4.827225130890052
2190533,3,B0006OGDCY,"As the Great Cornholio would say. This DVD is not the best of the Beavis and Butt-head series available on DVD, but it's good in its own way. The theme for ""Butt-O-Ween"" is based on scary stuff that Beavis and Butt-head have endured over the course of the series, but ""Beavis and Butt-head Do Christmas"" isn't all that appealing, as it is only one episode.

""Butt-O-Ween"" Psynopsis

1. ""Bungholio: Lord Of The Harvest"" You probably guessed it, and you guessed it right. Beavis becomes the Great Cornholio for the third time, but on Halloween night. Anyways, B&B dress up in extremely cheap and mundane costumes (Butt-head is covered with nacho cheese, and Beavis has his underwear over his head and calls himself a ""nad"". After several failed attempts to get candy, the boys go over to Tom Anderson's house, but when Tom is interrupted by a phone call from John Thomas (ha ha), Beavis ingests all of the candy and pisses Butt-head off by EATING IT ALL. The sugar causes hyperactivity, and Beavis becomes his alter-ego, The Great Cornholio. I think I've told you enough to get by...

2. ""The Pipe Of Doom"" B&B go into a construction work site and check out the pipes. Butt-head gets stuck in one of those pipes and the situation becomes so serious that an emergency squad had to pull him out while it was being broadcast live on TV.

3. ""Killing Time"" There is nothing good on for two hours on television, so B&B try to think of ways to kill time.

4. ""Leave It To Beavis"" The best one on this DVD yet. A parody to ""Leave It To Beaver"", with the black and white animation and such.

5. ""Ding-Dong-Ditch"" The boys try (and fail) to attempt a game of Ding-Dong-Ditch.

6. ""Late Night With Butt-head"" When watching the David Letterman show, B&B are inspired to create their own show like that.

7. ""Candy Sale"" This one features David Spade for guest vocals as Mr. Candy. B&B sell 200 candy bars to each other and end up with a total of 2 dollars.

""Beavis And Butt-head Do Christmas""

This one parodizes the Ebenezer Scrooge and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" stories. ""Huh Huh Humbug"" (the Ebenezer Scrooge one) is when Beavis dreams that he manages Burger World but predicts what will happen if he still his selfish self who watches porno all the time. ""It's A Miserable Life"" shows how the world could be a better place if Butt-head didn't exist on this world. The ""Letters To Santa Butt-head"" is a segment when people wrote to the show and asked crazy questions.

This gets three stars, because it could have gotten a better selection, but it's still good in its way.",1117411200,10,2561,4.569868995633188
2190534,5,B0006OGDCY,"This DVD is funny, The christmas episode is hilarious!!! It spoofs Christmas Carol, and Beavis is a man called Ebenezeer Screw, I guy that just doesnt care about any one, and the halloween episode is funny too! They shouldnt have cancelled this show, Mike Judge was so lame to create the way inferior King of the Hill and end this awsome show.",1105056000,5,343,4.548387096774194

2190538,4,B0006OGDCY,"I've been a B & B fan since 1993.  I was in my early twenty's then.  I have to admit, the boyz seemed a little more funny then, than they do to me now that I'm in my early 40's and have 4 children, 2 of whom are in their teens.  However, I couldn't stop myself from purchasing this DVD, just to have for ol' time sake.  I actually owned it on VHS at one time, but my wife gave it away to goodwill a year ago, without asking me first.  So, I knew what I was getting when I ordered it in DVD form.  Halloween is my favorite holiday, another reason why I purchased this DVD.  Even though there are 9 other episodes, including a couple Christmas episodes, the Halloween episode is my favorite.  This DVD seems to be quickly becoming a collectors item for B & B fans, so I'm glad I got my hands on a copy now.  I got mine used and it showed up in perfect shape, just like brand new, minus the plastic wrap. Overall, it was definitely worth the money.  I plan to watch it from time to time, when the kids are in bed, and I'll definitely get it out around Halloween. It's one of those things that makes me feel like I'm in my early 20's again.  A nice trip back to the good ol' days, even if it only lasts 85 minutes.",1428451200,2,1210,3.958677685950413

2190548,5,B0006OGDCY,Disc plays great and these teenagers are funny as always! Beavis and Butt-head are a classic 1990's carton.

2190552,5,B0006OGDCY,"If you like Beavis and Butt-head, you will like this dvd.  If you don't like them, then save your money.  Beavis and Butt-head are like The Three Stooges: people either like them or they don't.  This dvd compiles the Halloween and Christmas specials featuring the moronic duo at the idiotic best.  Personally, I thought the Christmas shows were better than the Halloween show but I enjoyed both nonetheless.  The Christmas shows are a parody of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""Its A Wonderful Life"" and they are hilarious.  In the Halloween show, the boys have trouble getting candy going door-to-door and end up in their very own horror story.",1337990400,4,637,4.851851851851852
2190553,3,B0006OGDCY,"The Christmas special is a favorite of fans and non-fans alike, but this version doesn't have the music videos!  You don't realize how much they add to the episode until you've seen it both ways.  I wish they'd re-release the version with the music videos included (probably copyright issues).",1299715200,,293,4.959183673469388
2190554,4,B0006OGDCY,"Although this DVD also has the Halloween episode on it, if you're looking for B&B's Xmas episode where Butthead goes through his own ""It's A Wondertful Life"", it's also on here, and it's pretty funny. The B&B Boys are pretty big in our household this year, and you'd think I'd be getting sick of them by now, but I admit - if my kid has them on, I find an excuse to sit down and laugh, too. I've said before that this cartoon is so dumb, it's brilliant, and I really, really like that it is not mean-spirited, like so many of the newer 'teen' cartoons are. Hey, I love most of ""Family Guy"", but I'm getting more than a little uncomfortable at how 'jab jab jab' it's been getting, lately. (Hey, Seth, lay off Michael J. Fox, okay?) Still time to track this down for this year's gift giving, and I give it a solid 4 stars! =)",1290816000,6,823,4.182389937106918
