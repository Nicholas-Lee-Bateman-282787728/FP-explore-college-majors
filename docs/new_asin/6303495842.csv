7850145,5,6303495842,Michael Biehn is easily one of my favorite actors and he is wonderful in this movie. He gives his usual stellar performance. You can always count on him to be the best part of any movie he appears in.,1323302400,,200,4.153846153846154

7850147,4,6303495842,"I think this story itself had a lot of potential. Michael Biehn played an exellent role in becoming a pschotic killer hunting after his obsession. Alexandra Vandernoot filled the role completely as the lovely,courageous woman living in the wilderness in the unknown territories of reservation land...
Iowaka however played a good supporting role, what happened to her real voice? The screen setting was excellent and literally brought you back to the wooded days when travelling was done by dog-sled & snow shoes...those were the days!",1018569600,2,535,5.305882352941176
