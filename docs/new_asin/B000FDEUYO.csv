2561724,4,B000FDEUYO,"""Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player/ That struts and frets his hour upon the stage/ And then is heard no more: it is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing."" So wrote Shakespeare in Macbeth. Whether he was right is the question that every character in this film struggles to answer. The plot revolves around a train wreck, and how the various people related to that wreck and to the newspaper that reported the story (the editor, a reporter, the wife, the train worker), interpret the event. Was it suicide? Negligence? Fate? Murder? The artist Meryl hallucinates about this and many other Freudian fears (cleverly represented by animation). She meets the photo-journalist Nick who has his own existential fears, not the least of which is his cancer diagnosis. In the end their love moves beyond the many limits that life and death impose upon our fragile existence.",1169596800,7,905,4.84516129032258
2561725,5,B000FDEUYO,"`Look Both Ways' released in '05 is a disarming and inventive film from ""Down Under"" which confronts the grim images and stories of death and dying that bombard us everyday in the media. Where does anyone find the courage and humor to face the inevitability of ones personal demise and carry on with life in a positive fashion? This is just such a story of love and hope found at the death scene of a train/pedestrian collision.

This movie contains a cast of complete unknowns, at least to me, that do a wonderful job at exploring the depth and breath of emotions that can overwhelm us when faced with the temporal nature of our existence. `Looking Both Ways' is unpredictable, thought-provoking and entertaining. This is definitely a film that demands repeat viewings.",1168819200,4,770,4.833333333333333
2561726,3,B000FDEUYO,"""Look Both Ways"" is one of those movies about people who get themselves all tied up into knots over....whatever. In this case, it's over death. In a small Australian city, a lonely thirty-something greeting card artist named Meryl (Justine Clarke) witnesses a man be killed by a train when he tries to prevent his dog from being hit. Nick (William McInnes), a photographer from a local paper who arrives on the scene, takes a liking to Meryl. He wants a girlfriend but is reluctant, because he just found out he has cancer. Meanwhile, Andy (Anthony Hayes), an obnoxious reporter who interviewed Meryl and speculated needlessly about the tragedy is feeling put-upon by pregnant ex-girlfriend Anna (Lisa Flanagan), who can't decide if she's going to have the baby or not.

You'll like this movie or hate it depending upon your feelings about the characters. Some people will identify with their angst. I find them insufferably neurotic. Meryl is a fearful woman whose morbid anxieties are expressed in animation, so we can see them. At least she has a morbid sense of humor too. Nick is testy because he has cancer, but that's not interesting. I could not tell you why Andy and Anna are in such an aggravated state. In the background are the two people who are actually affected by the unfortunate death on the train tracks: the victim's girlfriend and the driver of the train. They frame the film, but it's not about them. It's about the constant presence of death in our lives and how people cope with it...or fixate on it, as the case may be. ""Look Both Ways"" is ultimately optimistic, but I couldn't stand 5 minutes with these characters.

The DVD (Kino Video 2006): In ""An Interview with Sarah Watt"" (13 min), writer/director Watt talks about bringing the characters' interior lives to the audience through the animated sequences, the structure of the film, Meryl's character, and casting Justine Clarke. In ""An Interview with Justine Clarke"" (14 min), the actress tells us how she got the part, doing her own painting in the film, and discusses the Nick-Meryl relationship and their argument scene at length. There is a Stills Gallery with 15 color production stills.",1165881600,4,2171,4.880758807588076
2561727,4,B000FDEUYO,"Death is a touchy subject to broach regardless of the medium in which you choose to expose it. It's uncomfortable to even think about yet touches us all on many levels, and that is why LOOK BOTH WAYS succeeds.

Building on death in thought-provoking, sad, and often hilarious terms, Look Both Ways binds a small Australian community together after the death of a man upon the local railroad tracks. Meryl (Justine Clarke, DANNY DECKCHAIR) witnesses the horrible event and summons the authorities. The local media shows up, including photojournalist Nick (William McInnes, IRRESISTIBLE) who's just been diagnosed with a rapidly spreading cancer. Also on the scene is Nick's newspaper partner Andy (Anthony Hayes, NED KELLY) and eventually the deceased's wife Julia (Daniella Farinacci, BROTHERS).

Meryl sees the event as just another death, something that fill her thoughts and her paintings on a daily basis. Her vivid imagination surrounding death is illustrated (literally) via laughingly silly animated sequences that are sure to tickle your dark funny bone. Photojournalist Nick sees himself on the railroad tracks, having just received a medical death sentence of metastatic testicular cancer. Newspaper writer Andy battles to understand life and death while struggling to be a good father to his divorced children, and the discovery that his new girlfriend is pregnant with an unwanted child. Widow Julia tries to understand the seemingly meaninglessness of her husband's death as flowers flow into her home and she's forced to come to grips with such a sudden loss.

Where Look Both Ways succeeds is in its delivery. Each person views death under their own unique umbrella, but are bound together by this one tragic event. Meryl and Nick become oddball lovers during a one night stand, while newsman Andy tries to sort through his chaotic and merciless lifestyle. Widow Julia and the engineer who was driving the train are two of the more interesting cases within the story, as they have no speaking parts until the very end, but are given ample screen time which speaks volumes on its own.

The message of the flick is simple but not forced: look at death both ways. See it as a necessity but don't dwell on it. There is hope and fear within it, operating not at opposite ends of the spectrum, but as a gauge on how to live life without death looming ever present on one's mind.

Meryl, the one who the film is mostly about, learns this lesson the hard way, coming to terms with her own fate, and that of Nick who's cancerous life is destined to plow into hers with the force of a padded sledgehammer.",1165536000,9,2610,4.936218678815489
2561728,5,B000FDEUYO,"In one of this Australian drama's best scenes, two characters obsessed with death look a different way. One is an artist, Meryl Lee (Clarke), who turns everyday events in her imagination into fatal accidents and crimes after the sudden passing of her father. The other is a globe-trotting photographer, Nick (McInnes), who in the movie's first few minutes is diagnosed with testicular cancer that's traveled to his lungs. He starts seeing, in photographic montages, terrible sickness and death. The two are awkwardly flirting in Meryl's apartment after unexpected encounters at the scene of an accident and the next day on the street. They both anxiously confide in each other that they see death when they look at people, then just as anxiously ask if they see death when they look at each other. Both answer no. In just a few days' time, their relationship grows just as suddenly as the cancer tumors Nick imagines bursting from his body and the faces of strangers.

But that's just one piece of the film's narrative, which also boasts a Crash-like intermingling of people, events, hopes and fears with unplanned pregnancies, reformed workaholics, terrible grief and familial reconciliation. However, unlike Crash -- a film about racism that beat viewers over the head with its message -- Look Both Ways tackles the ultimate equalizer, death, with gentle touches and a believable dialogue and story.

The film's message and satisfying happy ending? We can't conquer death, but we can learn to live with it if we look both ways: be cautious and healthy, take risks and be happy.",1160870400,19,1579,5.022900763358779
2561729,5,B000FDEUYO,"Meryl (a smart, put-upon, long hippie-skirt wearing, Justine Clark) daydreams about death and disaster and these occurrences take physical shape via animated scenes that Australian Director/Writer Sarah Watt intersperses throughout her volatile, crazy, ""Magnolia"" without the pretense, ""Look Both Ways."" On paper, these animated sequences may sound tricky and maybe too obvious but in reality, they seem natural, a little crazy, maybe...but completely natural in this world that Watt has created.
One day Meryl sees a man run over by a train: it's her worst nightmare come to life. Does it freak her out? Does it send her into a catatonic fit? Does it send her to hospital?
Nope.
She accepts it as something that was ""meant to be"": a mantra that shapes the rest of this tremendously affecting, heartfelt though oftentimes surrealistic film.
Watt structures the film along the lines of several other films like ""Short Cuts"" or ""Nashville"": intertwining stories featuring others affected by the train accident: a photographer, Nick (good-guy, emotionally available, William McInnes), Newspaper writer, Andy (an emotionally unavailable, un-communicative except in his writing, Anthony Hayes), the Train Driver (a destroyed, Andreas Sobik) and their significant others.
""Look Both Ways"" is something that all Mothers tell their children. It means be careful, take care, I need You: there's always something out there looking to hurt you. But here it also means: Look closely, don't be fooled by the surface of things... things are not always what they seem; there are always at least two ways to evaluate any situation.
Watt shares the slightly out-of-kilter, skewed towards the witty and intelligent world view of her fellow Aussie film makers and she imbues ""Look Both Ways"" with both an open hearted sense of fun and a profound, natural love of her characters and their strange but always human ways.",1146528000,20,1899,5.312292358803987

2561737,4,B000FDEUYO,"Contrast with ""More Than Blue"" (http://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Blue-Kwon-Sang-Woo/dp/B007202W1G/), a Korean film with a similar theme of two people who have the potential for a romantic relationship marred by a medical condition. Different cultures, two completely different outcomes. Though IMHO the two movies have the same message.

In this film, death is everywhere. Imagined by Meryl, feared by Nick, but also in ample supply in the form of train accidents and the passing of loved ones. Alongside this there is the beginning of new life, at least for one character. The message of the movie seems summed up by Nick's mother when she opines that the important thing is not how we approach death, but how we live our lives.

It's not a new philosophy, but it's well-placed here and a good reminder.

Personally, I found the interjection of the animated disaster sequences (in which Meryl suffers one fate or another) a bit jarring, and likewise Nick's web-search based anxieties. I think the film could have worked just as well conveying those characters' fixations more conventionally. That said, they were only used densely near the beginning of the film, and the technique was used to good effect at the end to bring us some closure. Overall, I don't think it was a serious enough problem to affect my rating of the film.",1410652800,,1329,5.059360730593608

2561747,4,B000FDEUYO,"Six degrees of separation between what happens in your life and people you barely know.  The artistic female character in this movie is obsessed with disasters and fears which are displayed in cartoons from her imagination.  Coming home from her father's funeral, she's the eye-witness to a man who died after getting hit by a train.  When she first saw this man on the other side of the train tracks, she feared him to assault her until she sees him playing with his dog moments before he dies.  A reporter, a photographer come to the scene of the accident and then the movie stitches the six degrees of separation.  In our ordinary lives, where we fret and worry about our problems, we can soon realize that other people have it worse.  That's what happens in this movie and it is all stitched up with happy endings.

I liked this.  It was a surprisingly good movie.

I wasn't impressed by any of the characters at first & I think that was intentional. The characters grew in line with the story, so I never even noticed how everyone changed as the film progressed. New stuff, new character development flowed easily & naturally. Brilliant. Of course, the guy got the girl in the end & that all that really matters, right ?",1382054400,,469,4.529411764705882

2561751,5,B000FDEUYO,"This movie does a great job of addressing some ironies of life (not the fake Alanyse Morset kind, she had no clue what real irony was).  If you've ever thought about why you have so much, when somebody else has so little, or if you've ever felt that perhaps you shouldn't complain about your own pain because of the starving and abused children all over the world, this will give you some laughs.  Really, no matter where you are, life ends and sometimes that's the one thing that can unify us as people.",1357948800,2,504,4.408602150537634
2561752,5,B000FDEUYO,"""Look Both Ways"" is about life and death, grief and joy, how lives are linked and forces the characters to take stock in their lives.  It takes place over a 3-day weekend and looks into the lives of a few Australian characters, how they experience and react to life and the death that will come to us all, to some, sooner than later.  Filmed in Adelaide, Australia, a low budget movie about ordinary people, I found it to be a very moving picture.  It teaches us to live in the now and relish and yes, ravish what we've have, our lives and those we care about.  The theme song ""Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone"" is a haunting melody that only adds to enjoyment and meaning of this of this film.

I've listened to this song and watched the movie many times, only to snatch and extract another ""tidbit"" from it that I'd missed in a previous viewing.  The only problem I can see is not to forget the lessons this story teaches us in how to conduct ourselves in our day-to-day living, getting the most out of that existence, taking stock every once in a while of ones own life and not dwell on the eventual death.  It is so easy to forget the important stuff and focus on the trivial.  No need to spell out the story to you, there are enough reviewers who have already done that.  Besides, it works best if you don't know what's coming.

We're all going to die eventually and to steal a line from the movie; ""it doesn't matter how life ends, it matters how it was.""  We all will die, but it is how we live, treat others and embrace life that makes the difference in our lives and those around us.",1316995200,5,1587,4.256666666666667
2561753,3,B000FDEUYO,"So many of us place our feet on the ground each day after a fitful nights sleep, wondering what disaster or disappointment may befall us as the day progresses. Cancer, unexpected death, freak accidents, we just never know exactly what lurks around us. LOOK BOTH WAYS addreses these phobias in the everyday world with poignance, good heart and just a touch of black humor. The message: the devil may be be nipping at your heels but keep focused on the good stuff. Great friends, honestly and respect are the things that will rally and carry us through the rough patches. If I have one complaint about the movie, it's gotta be the alt/pop songs that creep up every 15 minutes or so. Too many songs and each one is played in its entirety. Kind of a lazy decision by the director to show us the emotional status of the main characters with telegraphed sentiment. This movie aims higher and I was somewhat disappointed by the unnnecessary pop soundtrack. Otherwise, a hearty recommendation.",1308182400,4,985,4.732558139534884
2561754,5,B000FDEUYO,Look both ways is an intelligent and creative movie that makes use of the multi-story line concept to weave one cohesive tale.  This alone is a rare feat.  It is basically a love story about two characters who meet when they are both at watershed moments in their lives. One has just lost her dad and the other has just found out he's got cancer.  The tale is mixed with poignant and humorous moments as the characters try to find their respective footings in order to face their new realities.  This continues to be a reoccurring theme with the other characters you meet in the movie as their lives intersect in interesting ways with the two main characters.  Anyone who has gone through a difficult time in their life will relate to the way each character moves from emotion to emotion until they settle on firm ground once again. I loved the graphics in the movie which literally painted pictures for the viewer of what was going on in the heads of the two main characters.  This creative use of graphics served as a great illustration of how we each have those moments of quiet desperation in our lives that no one knows anything about unless we find someone we can trust to share our inner stories with. This movie is an excellent illustration of how we search out and  need significant others in our lives to help us along life's way particularly when the going gets difficult.  The movie also plays with the dual ideas that things happen by circumstance vs. some things are meant to be and happen for a reason.  Perhaps this juxtaposition of ideas was the reason behind the title Look Both Ways.  Either way it is a thought provoking and enjoyable movie.,1289865600,4,1661,4.562289562289562

2561756,4,B000FDEUYO,"Along with a clutch of other recent small Australian films(Sommersault and Jindabyne),'Look Both Ways' breathes fresh life into an industry that is always under pressure to trumpet such ignominous big budget affairs as the recent Baz Luhrman fiasco. Other reviwers have staked out the considerable merits of the film, the feel of Altman's,'Shortcuts' is distinct. McInnes and Clarke are teriffic in their fumbling affair. The contrast between his photographic inner view of the world and her painterly, emotive one is ingeniously filmed. And the reduced locations certainly helps with the flurry of interlocked narratives; the railtracks and the graffitied wall, key amongst these. Wonderful effort bySarah watt and yes, the musical accompaniment was spot on.",1235865600,4,759,5.608695652173913

2561758,5,B000FDEUYO,"I bought this movie after seeing Justine Clark in Danny Deckchair. I really liked her performance, but I wasn't prepared for this. She is so different in this movie. Of course the movie is SO different from anything else I've watched. This movie is not for everyone. But if you like ""different"" movies, especially if they're about death and life, then this could be for you. This is a comedy of handling life and and all its aspects. Love, loss, illness, birth and yes, a death that ties it all together. Its also a film about over coming fear. The animation makes the movie. Ibsen or Tolstoy would have spent hours describing what the animation does in carefully woven sequences in a few seconds. They tell the story behind the story, revealing much about how we handle situations, real and perceived. If you think life is about taking a chance, take a chance on this movie.",1196294400,6,875,4.615384615384615
2561759,5,B000FDEUYO,"What a wonderful discovery! I had no idea this film existed, and only stumbled upon it by accident ... or serendipity? You'll definitely give a lot more thought to coincidence, and the random nature of life, and the delicate web of unseen connections, after watching this thoughtful story.

From the mysteriously swerving flights of birds to the regular passage of trains, we're reminded of the nature of existence -- both certain & uncertain. When a single death occurs, the lives of countless people are affected & interwoven. And the possibility of death has an equally powerful effect, making the film's characters & its viewers alike more aware, more conscious, of the world we all take for granted.

What's especially impressive is how writer/director Sarah Watt handles this existentially ponderous material with a sure, understated hand. Her background as an animator comes into play, not merely in the fantasy images of Meryl's fears, but in Watt's ability to trust in the image, the actor's face, the slightest pause, to convey a wealth of emotions. No need for painfully obvious exposition here!

And the actors are superb. Thankfully looking like real people rather than models, the characters negotiate life in a welter of mixed emotions, often saying or doing the wrong thing, then realizing it just a moment too late. You get the feeling that you could meet these people, get to know them in everyday life. From Nick & Meryl's hesitant romance, to the emotionally shattered train driver & his family, to Andy's anger & fear, these are all honest portraits of familiar people.

But if this is a film about death, it's also about life. Children appear throughout the film, quite significantly, and the adults are brought to thresholds of new awareness. Again, none of this is done in a heavy-handed fashion. Watt relies on humor & awkwardness to carry a lot of the weight, and the film's all the more effective for it. Sobering without being bleak, funny without being glib, it leaves the viewer contemplative after the final credits have faded to black.

Most highly recommended!",1192406400,6,2093,5.002873563218391

2561761,4,B000FDEUYO,"I will not be the first to observe that to look at life is to look at death, as they say at Chinese restaurants, ""It comes with.""  This movie is quick to remind us that we spend our lives looking away, pretending that death is a foreigner, instead of a brother.  For various reasons all the people in this movie are exceptional, looking at death the way they would look at their reflections in the mirror, and we get to see how they handle it.

The ""cross-cut"" scripting will remind viewers of Crash and/or Magnolia, two lousy movies that tried unsuccessfully to kluge random bits of footage together by using BIG themes. In Crash the big theme was racism, in fact, it was as though Hollywood had a party so it could pat itself on the back for discovering racism - you go girl!  In Magnolia the big theme was squeezing in as many celebrity cameos as possible - (you know you've got problems when a frog-storm steals your movie).  Watch Magnolia again.  John C. Reilly, who has demonstrated his ability to be a consistently awful actor, is even more awful than usual.  It's as though his idea of acting is anti-acting.

Look Both Ways unifies its rag-tag cast with mood (hot Australia), superb cinematography, and key places used as leitmotifs (the train yard - the mural) - as well as the absolutely splendid animations of its star, Meryl, Justine Clark.  Clark's likeability gives the film its greatest strength; her morbid obsessions are in hilarious juxtaposition to the chirpy greeting cards she makes for a living.  Nick, her love interest, William McInnes, is a bit harder to warm up to.  Then again, his wooden demeanor, (not to mention the bloodless dispassion that comes with his job, press photographer), has been earned, he just found out he's dying of cancer.  Which of course is the starting point for this film - everybody's dying one way or another.  Or, to put it another way, every life is complete and completely lived; the only difference between them is the length.

If you hadn't gotten it yet, director Sarah Watt makes sure you do with the introduction of Anna's pregnancy.  There is no joy associated with this news; it merely has the power of reminding Andy and Anna that what they have is no relationship at all.  Meantime Andy, a journalist, is working on a series of articles he hopes will prove that most fatal accidents, especially among men, are not accidents but suicides.  Laughing yet?  Look Both Ways is not a great film, but it's very good.  Unlike Crash and Magnolia, which were slick, smug, and glib, it feels authentic and hand-made.  The characters seem real, if not uniformly likeable, and they really are confronting something we rarely if ever are brave enough to confront ourselves - and isn't that one of art's untidy duties?",1180569600,5,2770,4.70746887966805

Without becoming maudlin it manages to convey the texture and depth of the emotions we all feel when death and loss erupt unexpectedly into our lives, and does so with good humour and dignity.
