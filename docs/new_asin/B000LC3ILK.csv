2701597,5,B000LC3ILK,"This is the ultimate Rey Mysterio DVD collection, featuring the rise of the phenom we know as Rey Mysterio, Jr.  With Vince's hands on the biggest pro-wrestling video vault in history, the video chronicles Rey's journey from Mexican PPV, to the land of ECW, into WCW, then finally onto glory in the WWE.

Unlike other WWE DVD's, this video is devoted entirely to matches, with brief intros by Rey.  There is no documentary type info in this video.  Just pure, unadulterated Rey matches.",1198627200,,486,4.819277108433735
2701598,4,B000LC3ILK,My teenage son loves wrestling and he had asked for this video for several weeks. I ordered it and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived before the date promised.

2701599,5,B000LC3ILK,"People gave me hell for not thinking the HBK dvd isn't all that. I just think they should've took the same approach they did with this dvd. I mean Rey didn't just have one great match with people like Dean Malenko so there's more than one great match of theirs here. However my only problem is that there's no matches on it of his with people like Billy Kidman, Super Crazy or RVD. He has had fine matches with them as well. Matches where he teamed with Edge were also good.

  While I complained the HBK dvd has some rare matches but not enough of his big matches. This dvd has more big matches than it does rare matches. Yes Rey had awesome matches with Kurt Angle but I didn't realize until recently that he also had some great matches with Beniot that he actually won. I know there's no chance the WWE would've released that though. Even rarer is a match fresh out of WCW and in another league unmasked as well vs C.M Punk and Eddie Guerrero in a Triple Threat match. I didn't get fully through the set but I don't think Rey has any matches on it where he is unmasked though. Which is no surprise since he never wanted to lose the mask in WCW and Bischoff forced him to with a ""if you don't, you're fired"" threat.

  One rare match I am happy to see here though is his Eddie tribute match vs HBK. Plus besides his match vs Angle at SummerSlam, they could've had their match on Smackdown before SummerSlam that Rey actually won. Rey has also had good matches teaming with Edge and that culd've been here too. But hell they could just release a Vol 2 in the future to avoid making another dvd with some of the same matches.",1197331200,,1625,4.242718446601942
2701600,5,B000LC3ILK,"Rey Mysterio is arguably the most exciting wrestler ever!  This dvd shows great matches spanning his entire career, including the first match for AAA, then ECW, WCW, and WWE.  This dvd has so many matches!  Lots of classics on here with the late great Eddie Guerrero.  In my opinion, this is the best dvd the WWE has released so far.  If you pick this one up, even if you're not a serious Rey Mysterio fan, you won't be dissapointed.",1194480000,,433,4.430379746835443
2701601,5,B000LC3ILK,"2007 has been the greatest year so far for WWE DVD releases and this one proves it! This DVD has 29 of Rey Mysterio's greatest matches. It includes his first Pay-Per-View apperance in AAA(Mexico) and his debut in ECW,WCW,and WWE. It has nine cruiserweight title matches from WCW and his WWE cruiserweight title wins against Matt Hardy and Taijiri. One of the most emotional matches on the set is his match with Shawn Michaels at the Eddie Guerrero tribute show. Rey says a few personnal things about Eddie before the match is shown. It also showcases Rey's world title win at Wrestlemania 22. This DVD surpasses the 619 DVD release in 2003.

2701602,5,B000LC3ILK,"Ive had the privilege to watch a Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrera (dont know if thats how its spelt but thats what it says in this set) falls count anywhere match on a house show. The greatest match ive ever seen live and ive seen TNA's X-division live. This set has almost 30 matches and is the most since the Dusty Rhodes set. Unlike the Rhodes set though, there are no extras. Just matches and a few of Rey's comments. They have two more 3 dvds coming out in the coming weeks-Cena and HBK and im diffently get both of those sets. For now though, this is WWE's finest hour. A 100% improvement on the 10 match dvd of 619.

Pros: Lots of WCW matches, which is nice to see on dvd. About time they open up there vast library of wrestling tapes.

Cons: They don't show Rey when he was unmasked in WCW; They fail to show any tag matches with RVD, although it says Rob Van Dam in the Amazon heading for the product. They were an excellent duo together and should have added a tag match with them in the set.  Rey's run in WWE is different from his WCW run. Watch his WCW then swith to WWE, his style just seems very different. Maybe its because they are making him wrestle bigger wrestlers. No extras just matches.",1193270400,3,1207,4.216450216450217
2701603,5,B000LC3ILK,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2015

In a span of over a decade, Rey Mysterio has become one of the wrestlers in the world to make the statement of ""size doesn't matter"" due to the heart he shows in the ring resulting in going past the levels of success that other ""crusierweight"" wrestlers have achieved.  This is a match anthology with only Mysterio speaking throughout various parts of San Diego giving insight & background of each match featured.

w/Latin Lover & Heavy Metal vs. Madonna's Boyfriend, Fuerza Guerrera, Psicosis - Before I get started, it should be noted that this was a PPV put on by the AAA promotion in Mexico but broadcast on PPV via WCW, this was also the national television debut of Rey Mysterio, you would recognize the wrestler known as Madonna's boyfriend as Louie Spicolli.  This match was held under lucha libre rules where you had to enter tag your partner or go to the floor in order for another member of the team to be legal as you saw signs of the style the we would know Rey for as such as the head scissors takeover from various parts of the ring & various top rope maneuvers while another standout in this contest is Madonna's Boyfriend who showcased his power & strength advantage throughout the match such as easily shrugging off Mysterio & even tossing him into the front row at one point while everyone else showcased their high flying & even ground wrestling with submission attempts in a match full of non-stop action from bell to bell that definitely made a first impression for Mysterio.

vs. Psicosis - This was the debut of both men in ECW that went very fast paced with both men trading momentum right from the start with Rey getting the advantage with an armdrag to the outside before Psichosis came back using his superior strength with moves such as the tiger bomb & body press launch & frisbee slam but was caught when attempting the same maneuver twice allowing Rey to utilize his speed with a springboard frankensteiner, flying head scissors, and launching Psichosis into the turnbuckle off the apron with Psichosis going aerial with a top rope legdrop & top rope twisting dive while Rey decided to go extreme catching him with a suicide dive attempt with a chair & springboard dive into the second row. This was not only both men's ECW debut but also the debut of the ""Extreme Lucha Libre"" concept which did make a strong first impression.

WCW Hog Wild '96

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Super Calo - Super Calo took control early with offense such as a running roll-through powerslam & various top rope offense while working over the arm including a short arm scissors hammerlock as Rey attempted to gain some offense using his high flying lucha offense but Calo was able to keep staying a step ahead of him such as catching Rey in midair with a dropkick while Rey was able to pull off a one in a lifetime offensive move in a different type of match from Mysterio up to this point in career as he was heavily on the defense for most of the match.
WCW Fall Brawl '96

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Dean Malenko - Dean came out with a mask he took from Mysterio weeks earlier & attacked before the bell heavily focusing on him with stretches such as a sleeper from a grounded & standing sleeper while Rey used his speed & high flying to his advantage to catch Dean on more than one occasion as both men traded momentum with such offense as a twisting corkscrew to outside or various powerbombs from different positions while both men knocked each other off the top rope to the floor at one point in what was a competitive match that got real aggressive at times.
WCW Halloween Havoc '96

vs. Jushin Liger - Liger took control early with strong offense from a headbutt & stiff powerbomb on more than one occasion to a suplex over the top to the floor while working over the back with holds & submissions before Rey was able to rebound with some impactful offense of his own including DDT & camel clutch as both men traded momentum delivering one impactful move after another such as both delivering release german suplexes & going aerial at various times.  This was a crusierweight dream match between two international stars that lived up to the hype.
WCW Starrcade '96
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

vs. Ultimate Dragon - The commentators noted that Sonny Onoo wasn't at ringside like usual as both men started out attempting to ground each other with moves such as a camel clutch & short arm scissors & armbar as Dragon did some impactful moves as different powerbombs & even a piledriver along with some submission attempts working over the leg while Rey relied on his aerial assault delivering moves from either a corkscrew or springboard as they traded momentum using counters & reversals along with offense that not only hurt his opponent but himself in the process as this came down to one man being able to catch the other.
As a side note, all the backstage issues between the Steiner Brothers & Kevin Nash that was shown during this match was edited out.
WCW Spring Stampede '97

vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero - This had a ""Title vs. Mask"" stipulation meaning that Rey had to win the championship or unmask while it should be noted that he was wearing an outfit representing to the comic book/movie ""The Phantom"" with his mask attached to the outfit. Rey came out with very fast paced offense from either a springboard position or off the top rope including an over the top crossbody that sent both men over the top rope only for Rey to hold on while Eddie hit the guardrail causing Eddie to pick up the intensity using the ringside steps & heavily focusing on Rey's back with various impactful moves such a multiple backbreakers or stretch submissions including his father's Gory Guerrero Special while also continuing to rip at the mask as they traded momentum with Rey doing some aerial offense including some new offense that he would go on record saying that he did once & never again after this match along with an early version of what we now know as the West Coast Pop while Eddie continued to deliver intense impactful moves like a snap powerbomb & top rope crucifix drop. This has the reputation of being the greatest crusierweight match in WCW history & it's hard to argue that point after viewing this match.
WCW Halloween Havoc '97
[Rey Mysterio: 619; Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story; Wrestling's Highest Flyers; WCW's Greatest PPV Matches Vol. 1]

vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero - The third & final match in their trilogy of matches as Rey got the advantage early constantly taking Eddie off his feet with various takeovers before Eddie was able to catch Mysterio & heavily work over the back area with various suplexes either on the mat or in the air & submissions while slowing the pace down as both men continued to trade momentum both using impactful moves that drilled their opponent's head into the ground with Eddie using more of a mat game using offense such as a powerbomb & Gory Special stretch while Rey continued to use aerial offense from the top rope & springboard position as this came down to one man being able to catch the other.
WCW World War 3 '97

vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera - Rey came into this match with a bad leg which he hurt early as Juvi took control with his similar lucha libre inspired offense of high flying executing moves coming over the top rope or slingshot position while focusing on the leg causing Rey to wrestle defensively avoiding & fighting out of Juvi's offense using his momentum against him before once again coming off the top rope despite the bad leg as this match didn't go long but told a good story.
""WCW Thunder"" Jan. '98

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Chris Jericho - Rey came into the match wearing a brace due to his bad knee as Jericho started out mocking Rey due to his size only for Rey to slap him down to his size but hurt his knee again early on causing him to slow down & put his weight on his other leg allowing Jericho to work him over on the floor & using the ringside environment to his advantage focusing on the knee as Rey continued to fight as it came down to one man being able to hit a huge counter move to gain the victory with the bigger story being what happened after the match.
WCW/nWo Souled Out '98

vs. Psychosis - The winner would receive a future Crusierweight Championship match as Psychosis used his superior size & strength advantage to ground Rey with various submission holds along with still going aerial with offense off the top rope while Rey continued his trademark offense with multiple head scissors & high flying offense from the top rope & a springboard position along with a unique version of a legdrop face driver as they traded momentum to the point where it literally took one man having his head drilled straight down into the mat to get the win.
WCW/nWo Road Wild '98

vs. Blitzkreig - You saw where this match was going when it wasn't Mysterio but Blitzkreig executing a springboard twisting corkscrew moonsault in the opening moments he took the fight to Rey using fast paced high flying diverse offense such as a somersault backflip while Rey was able to counter his offense into his own including catching him in mid-air while going aerial himself in what was a short match but definitely hard fought for that time as this was Blitzkreig's debut but made a strong impression as Mysterio was facing off against someone almost exactly like himself.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Feb. '99

vs. Chavo Guerrero - Rey's WWE debut as his showcased his trademark lucha libre offense such as the head scissors takeover & high flying coming over the top rope & from a springboard position while Chavo focused on grounding Rey and heavily focusing on a specific part of the body with various stretches & impactful offense such as a Gory Special & Gory Bomb while also being able to counter some of Mysterio's offense in what was not only a strong debut but also Chavo's best showing in WWE to that point as well.
""SmackDown"" July '02
[Rey Mysterio: 619]

vs. Kurt Angle - Rey started off this match with a bang as they were evenly matched early on countering each other's signature moves early on before Angle heavily worked over Mysterio's back with strikes & stretch submissions along with landing him on his back with various impactful suplexes but Mysterio was able to rely on his high flying offense such as not only going over the top rope & the referee as well at one point while also jumping off the top rope into a springboard legdrop in what was a fast paced match with non-stop action.
SummerSlam '02

vs. WWE Crusierweight Champion Matt Hardy - Matt Hardy focused on the head & neck early on such as delivering a clothesline directly to the back of the head & pulling it against the ropes while also taking shortcuts such as his associates Shannon Moore & Crash Holly were making their presence known on the outside as well while switching focus to the lower body to the point where Rey was heavily showing the effects but Rey continued to fight on including using Matt's own moves against him as they traded momentum with both men coming off the top rope at different points to the point where one man had to catch the other to get the win.
""SmackDown"" July '03
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary]

vs. WWE Crusierweight Champion Tajiri - Both men started wrestling on the mat early with Tajiri focusing heavily on Rey's knee with various strikes & kicks along with delivering some impactful moves of his own such as a running tiger bomb as his associates Akio & Sakota would make their presence known at ringside while Rey continued to deliver his high flying offense from both a springboard & top rope position as both men would trade momentum countering each other's trademark offense.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '04

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Chavo Guerrero - Both men started off match wrestling early with both focusing on the arm with different types of armbars with Rey continuing to heavily work it over with strikes & dropping his weight directly on the arm before Chavo was able to take a page out of Mysterio's playbook that allowed him to focus directly on Mysterio's leg using the same tactics Mysterio did with his arm along with taking shortcuts & using illegal tactics as both men went back & forth taking advantage of the environment around them & using submission holds to where both men were heavily showing effects & even both fell off the top rope face first at one point.  They've had numerous matches against each other throughout their careers but I felt this was this best singles match against each other as they were given more time than usual to tell out a story & both using lucha libre influence offense with Mysterio relying on high flying while Chavo was more grounded and telling a story of heavily focusing on a body part.
Great American Bash '04

w/Eddie Guerrero vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Basham Brothers - Mysterio & Guerrero took control early using their fast paced lucha libre style focusing on a specific body part while the Bashams slowed the pace down attempting to ground the team & isolating one opponent from his partner along with using dirty tactics such as illegal switching & double teaming resulting in Eddie & Rey fighting fire with fire with some ""lying, cheating & stealing"" of their own.
No Way Out '05

vs. Eddie Guerrero - Rey came into this match more serious than usual to the point where he didn't do his usual entrance & had his ribs taped from Eddie's attack weeks earlier as both men traded slaps & punches before Eddie got more aggressive punishing Rey around ringside using the environment surrounding him & focusing on the ribs with stretches & submissions while Rey continued to use his signature offense while also using Eddie's own strategy against such as using the ring post on the outside what was a more aggressive match than we usually get from both men.
Judgment Day '05

vs. Eddie Guerrero - Eddie had a huge bruise on his waist from an attack by Mysterio the previous week as both men were evenly matched early on including both men giving each other clean breaks as Eddie attempted to ground him while Rey kept focusing on Eddie's bruise with an abdominal stretch from different positions until Eddie lost his tempter getting more aggressive delivering more impactful offense focusing on the back & using illegal tactics behind the referee's back while punishing Rey around ringside using the environment surrounding him in another competitive match telling the story of Eddie trying to out wrestle Rey only for him to get desperate when it didn't work.
""SmackDown"" June '05

vs. Shawn Michaels - This match took place at the RAW Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show with this being on the rare times that Shawn is bigger than his opponent as both men attempted to work over the same part of the body going very fast paced leading to a stalemate as Shawn used his rare superior size advantage to keep knocking Rey down & attempting to keep him grounded while Rey not only resorted to his lucha libre high flying style but also attempted to keep Shawn's height advantage away with low dropkicks to the knees & face in what was a unique match under the circumstances between two men with similar styles.
""RAW"" Nov. '05

vs. World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - P.O.D. performed Rey Mysterio to the ring as Orton attacked Kurt with the belt right from the start with Angle responding with not only a german suplex on Orton but another one on him & Mysterio at the same time before giving an assist to Rey lifting him up in the air for a top rope frankensteiner allowing Rey to take control as he was able to roll through a sunset flip attempt into a knockout kick followed by a head scissor takeover however Angle was able to counter an attempted 6-1-9 attempt into the anklelock & later catching Orton in the anklelock with the referee distracted both times as he kept deliver impactful german suplexes & an Angle Slam that sent one challenger over the top rope only for each man to come back with a big move from Orton's RKO to Angle's top rope belly to belly suplex & Rey delivering a 6-1-9 around the ring post before it came down to come man being able to ""divide & conquer"" long enough to get the victory. This was what a triple threat was designed to be in that it was non-stop action from all three men delivering one big move after another with each man looking like they had a chance but the major downfall of this (depending on how you want to look at it) is that this match was under 10 minutes when you would expect more from a World Championship match at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania 22
[Top 50 Superstars]

World Championship Match vs. J.B.L. - J.B.L. came into this match as the United States Champion as he kept easily pie-facing & shoving Mysterio down to the mat in the early moments constantly kicking & pounding him down before Rey was able to catch him off guard with some offense both in & outside of the ring as he kept the strategy of ""hit & move"" while keeping J.B.L. off his feet including a baseball slide that he definitely felt the effects of for the next few minutes as J.B.L. resorted to not only desperate tactics using the ringside environment to his advantage but also continuing to play mind games involving Rey's wife at ringside or Eddie Guerrero along with just punishing Rey to the point where he was bleeding but refused to quit still relying on his high flying lucha libre tactics as they continued to trade momentum throughout the contest as it came down to one man's tactics backfiring on him.
Judgment Day '06

Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Chavo Guerrero - Both men were evenly matched early attempting to use their lucha libre influenced offense while continuing to brawl throwing fist & forearms at each other to the point where they both knocked each other off the top rope early on as the fight went up the isle to the stage area with both men using the environment to their advantage before taking the match into the crowd with them using hockey boards & guardrails on each other while executing offensive off different areas of the area including a senton that hit a cameraman, crossbody off a section of stadium seats, and how Rey was able to modify a 619 using a piece of the building as this was a great match that came off as a real grudge match with both men making the best of the stipulation & environment around them.
No Mercy '06

""I Quit"" Match vs. Chavo Guerrero - Rey picked up where he left off from their previous match where he not only resorted to his high flying such as an over the top flipping seated senton but having no issues in using the ringside environment to his advantage causing Vickie Guerrero to make her presence known allowing Chavo to heavily focus on a body part with wrestling & using a weapon to heavily attack Mysterio's leg including a frog splash directly to the leg wrapped in a chair as the fight continued to the stage area as both men continued to use the environment around them to their advantage with both men being very aggressive & physical towards each other until one man just wasn't able to escape to relentless punishment delivered.

well this set comes with a very nice x-large t-shirt, It has Rey Mysterio on the front nothing on the back, the armbands are like the ones he used to wear with te mask logo and the 6one9. The pendant is very good quality, it is like Rey's tattoo with the cross and the aztec calendar.

The box looks great, it have more space so you can keep your Rey Mysterio dvd collection inside, the part of the box that you see the cover of the dvd its actually the dvd so you can remove it and put other dvd in the front and it would look like the cover for the set.

2701617,5,B000LC3ILK,"With Rey being a.) on Smackdown and b.) injured for so much of the past year, it's no surprise that this one went as far under the radar as it did.  And that's a shame, because this is one of the best DVDs that's come out from the E in recent memory.

First, Rey getting the three disc treatment is impressive in itself, but what's more impressive is the sheer number of matches spread over three discs. I think one of the things that makes the DVD so great is that there are so many matches that haven't appeared on WWE DVDs prior since they are from WCW. I also like that its a DVD that highlights action-filled, fun matches. Much of what you see in Rey's WCW matches was just so fresh at the time and it all holds up very well. The collection does a great job showcasing his time in all three promotions.

There are a few omissions, but little are extremely notable. The most glaring is that no matches are included from his unmasked time period in WCW (1999-2001), which is unfortunate as he was a major player in the organization until its demise, but also understandable as both he and McMahon tend to ignore this period for different reasons. Still, the inclusion of perhaps a match for the short-lived Cruiserweight Tag Team Title would have been nice.

Also, although the many championship reigns he's had make it hard to include matches from them all, it would have been nice to see matches from his time with Edge and also with RVD. In the case of the Edge reign, it's truly unfortunate that one of Rey's greatest matches, from No Mercy 2002, was against Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, the latter being the obvious reason for omission.

Still, a great set and highly recommended.",1215907200,,1688,4.467532467532467

8160735,5,B000LC3ILK,WwE does a great job with Rey Rey and all of his series of matches on this DVD set. He won me over as the years have gone by. Im a Rey Mysterio fan and he is a future Hall of Famer.,1446422400,,181,3.3333333333333335

8160737,5,B000LC3ILK,This collection is a WCW cruiserweight spectacle!!! Just the Eddie Guerrero Halloween Havoc 97 match alone makes this a MUST own!!!,1427932800,,131,5.285714285714286
8160738,4,B000LC3ILK,"Let me first say, I am NOT a Rey Mysterio Jr. fan at all. I AM a fan of Dean Malenko (3 matches), Ultimo Dragon (2 matches), Eddie Guerrero (3 matches), Titles changes (7 changes) & the WCW cruiserweight title. One reason I don't like Rey is he does the same moves every match including the lame 619. However for $8 you get a ton of good matches. It was nice to see Jushin Thunder Liger also, the match wasn't as good as the ones with Malenko but he is still a legend.",1412553600,,468,4.043010752688172
8160739,3,B000LC3ILK,"Dvd met expectations. Price was very reasonable and it was overall good. Thanks for sellin this to me, good bye",1368921600,,111,4.6
