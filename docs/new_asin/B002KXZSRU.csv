The blu ray of this movie is ONLY region 2 and will not play on us players unless you have a all region blu ray player.  There are lists online of which blu rays play all region.  Like the movie ""zulu' which while made in the uk will play on you blu ray player.  This one will NOT.  And the reviews here are for standard dvd editions of this item.  The movie is one of the most important horror movies ever made though, a true classic that changed everything that horror movies would become.",1265846400,,590,4.27027027027027
