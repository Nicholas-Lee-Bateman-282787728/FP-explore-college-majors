6296285,4,B00ITAQ458,I liked this movie still trying to figure what crows have to do with it. I'm going to have to watch it again to figure out what is going on but the acting was good and the gore was good and the naked was good. They were in a jail then they weren't it's confusing it just needs to watched more than once.,1409702400,4,303,3.8253968253968256

8645352,5,B00ITAQ458,A very visual purgatory story with the proper amount of ambiguity and creep.  Brilliantly acted and directed.  Loved it.,1481328000,,120,5.2631578947368425
8645353,4,B00ITAQ458,"At the start of the movie I thought I'd be watching another random torture picture, but once the story gets rolling, things get interesting.  Complicated, but interesting.  It's got a great gritty look, some good gore, and a whole lot of action.  What I really enjoyed was seeing some of the popular indie movie ""scream queens"" get a chance to show their chops and do some dramatic acting.",1479340800,,389,4.6911764705882355

The prisoner's sins are are revealed, and their punishments administered by the new arrival. The film had the feel, and special effects of some of the early Italian horror classics.",1466640000,,269,4.869565217391305

8645359,1,B00ITAQ458,"The best part about this movie is that, clearly, a group of people got together and decided that it would be a good idea to make it.  Who are these people?  Why did they do it?  Was this made as a joke?  I don't understand.",1464480000,,223,3.888888888888889
8645360,4,B00ITAQ458,"'Wrath of the Crows' is a very solid Horror movie, i believe shot on locations over sea, but filmed in perfect English, casting mostly American or British actors: i must say i was not expecting too much at the beginning, since i had heard mixed things, but i was instead immediately pleasantly surprised by its condensed, and visionary style, by the great and very gory special effects, and by the harrowing twists of a plot that keeps the tension of the viewer extremely alert, without stretches, and i found myself even wondering about this truly dark, brooding, mysterious story and its meanings. I liked and believed the main story, which was well written, and based on the main characters' development, a very fine choice with good use of flashback's and story telling, and, although i would have even wanted to know more about them, most of the actors' great work helped to bring them to life anyway, with an extremely believable intensity, demanding a brutally raw magnetism: some very fine performances were to notice here, and, since i am a fan of the genre, i enjoyed very much the casting, featuring, as i already conveyed, very effective performances, delivered with 'panache', especially by Tiffany Shepis, looking terrific, and carrying the piece with honor, and by Debbie Rochon, and Domiziano Arcangeli, who are all stars of Horror, but get to show here how great they can actually be, when the material is properly layered, and offering very dramatic notes, which they all nailed down completely, thanks also to their extremely strong presence, and, of course, by making an outstanding use of the experience necessary to carry a movie, without making audiences feel as they were watching the usual rubbish stuff, played by uninteresting people, lacking talent. And, that  was a great gain, although, the movie offers extremely visual and aggressive momentum as well, thanks to good technical key crew, among them, i thought the sound design was definitely an incisive key feature, enhancing the pace, and, escalating, as the story unfolded in what was an almost delirious territory. The main plot  again is very well orchestrated, and it organically tells the tragedy of addictions and sin, the remorse and regrets, the sorrows, and pains of those who have committed horrible crimes, and it nicely succeeds in taking us down deep to the roots of evil, always keeping a very delicate balance suspended between a supernatural, ghostly atmosphere, and a more realistic tone of brutality that only at times feels exploitative, but, that actually manages to stay very real, and more concentrated to the psychological intensity of the leads' subplots, and, it is for the most part very well handled, rich of suspense, while cleverly, never giving away too much, in order to keep us on guessing on whatever damnation would most likely be portrayed next, and we can easily howl, while trying to find out what truly lies beneath this degrading, sort of out of time and place,  prison, where Hell seems to break loose at any given moment! The movie with its own brutality take us closer and closer to an abyss of unknown, and even of very spiritual themes, always resulting very sharp, and haunting, thanks to very skilled Italian director Ivan Zuccon, who may definitely be up to finally revamp the cult for the great Italian genre movies of the 1960's, and 1970's we do miss so much, positioning himself as a new cult director of fame, and, reminding in a way, the likes of the Lucio Fulci's, Mario Bava's or Umberto Lenzi's, just to name those i believe were as dark, and as gruesome as he can get, showcasing a quite strong personal style he used very effectively, and in fact I was myself extremely entertained, never even thought once, about the usual budget's restrictions, since this movie truly looks, and, feels always professional, and never less than compelling. The only disappointment came unfortunately towards the end, when a convoluted series of events, all of a sudden, brought us to an unexpected, quite distracting, and honestly contrived, final twist, that did not strengthen our story, but, on my opinion, did take us away too abruptly, from the main plot line, trying to explore what  simply came across later,  as a way too obscure, and, muddled, philosophical argumentation, that i honestly felt quite out of place, and, again failing to add up much to the picture! However, 'Wrath of the Crows' remains a very good Horror movie, with just an intriguing mix of incredibly awesome assets, such as, last but not least, the beautiful, and saturated cinematography, and a cure for the details, that is much more common in Art House's films, than in your usual Horror's fare! To conclude, i believe that if you are a fan of the Genre, you will definitely find here a lot to like, and to appreciate, while,  if you aren't a fan, believe me, you will be still quite scared stiff, and probably very repulsed by the extreme use of gore, and, of 'old school' special effects, that however did prove as real and good as it gets, and that's another winning point of this pleasantly well crafted motion picture.",1441065600,2,5130,4.897583429228999
