8420775,2,B004ASDNP2,Interesting curio but the prints are horrendous.  Some of the shorts aren't even watchable.,1432857600,,91,5.5
8420776,5,B004ASDNP2,Very funny films. The film quality is as good as can be expected for early films. Worth it for fans of early comedy.,1366243200,,116,4.086956521739131
8420777,5,B004ASDNP2,"How pleasing childhood memories the contemplation, now in full format, of those beloved Snub Pollard movies! In the years of my childhood (1950's) it was very popular in Europe, and concretely in Spain, an infantile projector model of the French company Path-Baby, developed in the years 1920's that my grandparents had given as a present to my mother, when she was a little girl, and later on, I used it with great amusement. The available movies then, they were fragments of the original ones whose rights Path had hired, with a duration of about 5 minutes each one. There was Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Snub Pollard and others. Snub Pollard was known by its French denomination 'Beaucitron' (Beautiful lemon) (Why?) and I, together with friends of my age laughed a lot with him in the weekend days. It was our cinema! Very advisable this DVD for all those nostalgic of the silent movies.",1344384000,3,886,4.8355263157894735

Courtship Of Miles Sandwich (1923): Pop regales Junior with tales of Pilgrim days. Directed by Charley Chase (**NOTE: This is already out on the ""BECOMING CHARLEY CHASE"" DVD set from VCI).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Charley-Chase/dp/B002A2B348/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Charley Chase</a>

Join The Circus (1923  Hal Roach Studios): A vagrant launches a new career as a circus acrobat. Directed by George Jeske.

The Big Idea (1924  Hal Roach Studios): An inventor unveils his greatest achievement, a super street cleaner. Directed by George Jeske. (*** Not to be confused with the 1917 film by the same name that featured Snub Pollard & Starred Harold Lloyd.)

Vitamin ""U"" For Me (1942): Dr. Whoozis' vitamin and exercise regime turns young girls into supercharged pin-up models, in this musical extravaganza. Directed by Roy Mack.
This one has me puzzled, I have no record of this title existing, I assume it has been re-titled. Roy Mack's 1942 films are ""Hillbilly Blitzkrieg"" & ""12th Street Rag"". I believe Grapevine Video released this, un-restored.

Bonus:An Auto Nut (1924): With Paul Parrot.  Odd to include here as Snub Pollard has nothing to do with this short.",1292112000,8,1374,5.5095238095238095
