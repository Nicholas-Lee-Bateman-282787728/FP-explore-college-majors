8345176,2,B001391BTQ,"The camera work for this film can induce vertigo with its rapid scene changes.  Personally I like to be able to watch musicians play for at least 15 seconds before the angle changes.  The performance is raw and somewhat out of tune.  The show is of historic value as it is (I believe) Mick Taylor's first public appearance with the Stones.  Also the concert occurred two days after Brian Jones' death and includes a eulogy for him read by Mick Jagger (uninspired in my opinion).  At the risk of being sacrilegious, save your money for Shine a Light.  Superior filming and performances, despite being latter-day Stones.  Or get Gimme Shelter if you like earlier concert footage.",1227571200,5,677,4.7844827586206895
