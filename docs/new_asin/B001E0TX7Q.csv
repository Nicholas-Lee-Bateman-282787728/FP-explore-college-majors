8295866,1,B001E0TX7Q,"The music sounded as if it came from Charlie Brown
and the acting was off. They overacted many scenes
at inappropriate timing.  The writing was not believable.",1384128000,,159,4.888888888888889
8295867,5,B001E0TX7Q,"This is a very funny, satisfying, thought-provoking short movie.  Yes, it manages to be both edgy and sweet.  It is reminiscent of Woody Allen films, but without any slapstick.
