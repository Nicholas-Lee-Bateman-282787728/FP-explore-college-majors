2876569,4,B000RXZL0E,"The series was still going strong even in the fourth season. Barbara Eden did double duty at times playing Jeannie and her manipulative sister as well in some episodes. She plays Jeannie's mother as well too. The fourth season includes four DVDS but no extra features as well. The cast look like they're having a grand old time in the series.

While some series especially a comedy series could have gone stale or tiresome. This series keeps going strong even in the third and fourth seasons. Guest include Richard Mulligan, Judy Carne, Arte Johnson, and Gary Owens among them. You can't help but enjoy the series and forget about master and Jeannie. Despite the sexism in the series premise, the series gets away from it later on. Jeannie becomes more independent and troublesome but still lovable.",1448841600,,799,4.875

2876585,5,B000RXZL0E,"I enjoy watching reruns from some of the TV shows from many years ago. Some TV shows from yesteryear are much better than some of the ones made today. ""I Dream of Jeannie"" has always been one of my favorite comedies. It doesn't hurt that Barbara Eden played Jeannie. She was smokin' hot and incredibly sexy in her little Jeannie outfit so men love watching her, but the show was tastefully made so that it is pleasant for women and children to watch. When I saw that Amazon had the entire series, I purchased all five seasons. Even though I have not had the time to watch every episode, I have watched at least two episode of every season. Even though they are not as high resolution as Blu-rays are today and considering that most of these episodes originally aired in the late 1960s, they are remarkably sharp. I'm glad I purchased the B&W first season because I wanted them as they are were originally made. The colors in the Seasons 2-5 discs are well saturated, but might be off just a touch. After watching several episodes throughout the entire series, I believe they are the same as I have always seen on reruns without any edits. I have not noticed any differences. Since I know what these are like and if I didn't already own these, I would buy the entire series from Amazon. They are a great value for the price.",1417219200,,1323,4.448559670781893

2876587,4,B000RXZL0E,"I have enjoyed watching the series from start to finish with my kids- they love it!
However, I would say season 4 has some of my least favorite episodes. ""Guru Jeannie"" in particular stands out-
I hated watching Tony be manipulated by a teenager; I thought this episode was the low point of the series.  I can see why the writers decided to revamp for season five.

Having said that, we had fun meeting Gin Gin- truly classic humor.  We also liked the ""My Vanishing Master"" episodes.
So, while some of the episodes in season 4 were not our favorite,  overall we did enjoy it.  Season four is still way better than anything on TV these days!",1415491200,,640,4.435897435897436

The card board box of the episode guide does not match up with the dvd sets. I did some research to see why the shows were missing. They`re should`ve been a insert explaining about shows were missing. People like myself grew up on the series. I knew something wasn`t right with it. This was a major disappointment.

2876604,5,B000RXZL0E,"""I Dream of Jeannie"" is one of those rare 1960's sitcoms that has seen all its seasons released on DVD individually or in a complete series set. The color is impeccable, the sound is top notch and the studio has done a superb job remastering the old NBC/Screen Gem tapes. In all you will not be disappointed if you purchase this set and the current price of each DVD set is well below the street costs.

 The fourth season began in 1968 and contains all 26 shows that are funny, hilarious, well-written ans shows the reason why the series stayed on NBC for an incredible five years! The only show, in my opinion, the outshines ""Jeanne"" is ""Bewitched"", the series ""Jeannie"" was based on. But make no mistake: ""I Dream of Jeannie"" has its own uniqueness and originality and it is a sitcom that has been beloved for nearly 50 years!",1375228800,3,829,4.483443708609271
2876605,5,B000RXZL0E,Who can't like Jeannie?  It is cute & funny.  The cast blend together quite well.  I am sure a lot of young boys were fascinated by Jeannie in our formative years.,1370736000,,163,4.193548387096774
2876606,3,B000RXZL0E,"This is not of a review of the series, but rather a review of the manufacturing.  I was watching on my TV when all of a sudden the disc froze and then started to skip.  At first I thought it might be my player so I tried it on my computer and the same thing happened at about the same point.  So I then decided to look at the disc to see if it was scratched. IT HAD GLUE ON IT!  So after cleaning the discs they play fine now.  I just hope it did not damage my machines.  I also felt the inside of the box where the discs are held and sure enough it has a sticky feel to it.  Bottom line....clean the discs before playing and clean the inside of the box so glue does not reapply itself to the discs.  This was a first for me and I own many DVDs and Blu-rays.  Just wonder if anyone else had the same problem with IDOJ the complete 4th season.",1370476800,,842,3.8488372093023258

2876612,4,B000RXZL0E,"The fourth season of I Dream of Jeannie (1968-69) continues in much the same direction as the previous season, as the stories remain outrageous, and loosely connected with reality, as new comedic realms are explored.

Jeannie (Barbara Eden) and her master, Air Force Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman) are more of a couple than ever.  Except for her sister, Jeannie has virtually no female rivals, and the topic of marriage rarely arises.  Approaching the time when Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, would actually land on the moon, this season would feature Tony and fellow astronaut Roger Healey (Bill Daily), on their own mission to the moon.

By now, the strange events that surround Tony, have become routine for Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke).  A change this season is the welcome return of Barton MacLane as General Peterson, and the reestablishment of the dynamic where Bellows unsuccessfully tries to convince Peterson and later General Schaeffer (Vinton Hayworth), that something is amiss.  With a little more emphasis on the happenings on the base, the role of Bellows' wife Amanda (Emmaline Henry) is reduced at bit, but she remains a kooky, offbeat, and very fun character.

Barbara Eden assumes additional roles, one as her dark haired sister Jeannie #2, and also as her feisty mother.  Larry Hagman's physical talents are routinely exploited, as he flips, falls, and flies, all over the place.  An impressive display of his skills are featured in ""The Strongest Man In The World"", where Tony fights against a boxing champion.  This season doesn't have a ton of high profile guest stars, but boxer Jerry Quarry's appearance in this episode is one.

One of the most momentous occasions occurs in ""Around the World in 80 Blinks"", as Tony, Roger, and mission commander Wingate (Richard Mulligan) are aboard Apollo 14 on a mission to the moon.  Unfortunately Jeannie has a cold, which affects her ""blinking"" powers, and Tony and Wingate, wind up back in Coco Beach, where they are seen by Amanda Bellows.  What should be a high point for the series, doesn't quite measure up, but the episode features a breakout performance by Emmaline Henry.

Tony is a bit too old for the teenage scene, and this minor ""generation gap"" comes into play in ""Jeannie, My Guru"", where Nelson becomes the chaperone for a general's rebellious teenage daughter.  The subject of drugs is of course taboo, but when Tony's house becomes the scene of a wild party, it is probably the closest thing to a drug based hippie celebration you'll see in the series.

Perhaps the new character with the most impact is Djinn Djinn, Jeannie's dog who can become invisible, and attacks anyone wearing a uniform.  The little guy appears in two episodes, ripping and shredding clothing, and terrorizing General Peterson.  Jeannie looks into the future in ""Jeannie, the Governor's Wife"", as Jeannie makes Tony an unwilling candidate for the governorship of Florida, as Roger eagerly assumes the position of campaign manager.

In its fourth season, I Dream of Jeannie remains a fun program that while attempting to remain fresh and relevant, shows some signs of repetition, and unfortunately has some episodes that are real misfires.  Besides some uneven writing and lazy endings, there is also a lack of coordination.  The Apollo 14 mission to the moon episode, ""Around the World in 80 Blinks"", should probably have been the season finale.  Instead the episode ""Blackmail Order Bride"" is the finale, and features Tony and Roger as members of the ""Apollo 15"" mission.

Evidently creator Sidney Sheldon and his staff decided that some major changes needed to be made, and so Jeannie and Tony would wed in the series' fifth and final season.  Image quality of the 26 episodes is generally good, although there are some instances of where quality suffers, or soft focus is evident.",1339718400,,3860,5.023547880690738

2876614,5,B000RXZL0E,"The I dream of Jeannie series is highly entertaining, for both young and old, in so much that the plot lines are genuinely innovative, and given that the lead character utlizes powers beyond the mortal, the plots can take intersting and very funny twists. This is not only a cute comedy series, but also manifests the remarkable talent of Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman, both of which double the show's entertainment value. The humor is sometimes silly, but mostly artistically skewed, which produces genuine laughter. I would recommend this to any viewer with a desire for innocent and satirical humor.",1323820800,,602,5.03

2876618,5,B000RXZL0E,"My review is not just based on season 4 but on the entire series. But I'm putting my review on S4 because I think it's the best season. Just about every episode in this season was great. My faves are ""Pipchicks"" and the one where Jeannie blinks Tony and Roger into a film where they are early inventors of the airplane like they were the Wright Brothers. The film is shown in front of top NASA officials. I laughed so hard I fell of the couch.

IDOJ was my favorite comedy from the 60s and of ALL-TIME. They don't make shows like this anymore. With DVDs of this show an other classic comedies of its day, who needs cable or network tv anymore. All the comedies of today are downright horrible. They are all about relationships and LOADED with sex jokes (both straight and gay). Sitcoms are DEAD as far as I'm concerned.

I watch IDOJ today and still laugh just as hard and enjoy them as much when I was a kid growing up watching the reruns.

Buy these seasons while they are available. They are so funny and far better than today's tv, they might be banned or pulled off the market someday where we may be FORCED to watch current shows.",1281484800,5,1136,4.299065420560748
2876619,3,B000RXZL0E,"Stereotypical representation of Southern folk in this episode for sure.  Dumb hillbillies who don't knows what an astronaut is.  After accidentally landing on a farm in south, mayhem and stupid comedy all based on the fact that the farmers don't know that there is a space program.  Poor Jeannie is chased by one of them and accidentally hits her head on a rake or a hoe - you know the old gag from the time.  She forgets who she is and can't blink them away from the folk.

2876630,5,B000RXZL0E,"I never watched I dream of Jeannie before. Mostly heard from my Mom, who was practically raised on it whilst living in New York and watchin TV serials most of the time. I remember spending most of my childhood listening to her stories of course based on her favourite episodes. I was just a kid then and thought she was making up these stories. It was truly
a magical time. And now 20 years later I saw my childhood stories with my own eyes. I couldn't believe my own eyes. It was a feeling that I was looking for something my whole life and now found after all these years of search. It is overt now. Feels like I'v returned to my sacred, safe place and everything is on its place now. I am home now.

P.S. Expressing my feelings is hard. I tried...

2876631,5,B000RXZL0E,"Another great season of I Dream of Jeannie!  Funny clean humor!  What a blast!  I love being able to watch any episode I want whenever I want.  If you are a Jeannie fan this is a must have as well as every other season!  I buy them all!  Yes, this is an older show, but if you haven't seen it, check it out, you just may find you enjoy it!  You like to laugh?  Than this is for you!",1206403200,6,382,3.7468354430379747

I would love to see extras such as bloopers and outtakes from this show. Overall, this is definitely a TV show box set on the cheap. So, if you can get the set on the cheap go for it. Otherwise, wait for the reruns to return on TV Land.",1205712000,,380,4.0131578947368425

2876634,5,B000RXZL0E,"I am so pleased with my purchase of I Dream of Jeannie: The Complete Fourth Season through Amazon.  I have found the pricing to be more competitive than in department stores, where you have to wait until there is a sale before getting a good deal, and then there is the chance that the item will not be in stock.  It is fast and convenient to use Amazon, and the selection is great.  My item arrived in a short period of time, and it was in the condition promised.  I own all the released seasons of I Dream of Jeannie and plan to purchase subsequently released seasons through Amazon.",1202428800,,585,4.339449541284404

2876638,4,B000RXZL0E,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Complete Fourth Season and now have the complete set and am awaiting anxiously for the release of the Complete Fifth Season.  I Dream of Jeannie takes me back to when television was wholesome and ""funny"" wasn't making sarcastic remarks about your mother and father and treating them like idiots.  This was a time of respect, with no nudity, sex scenes or blasphemy.",1196294400,5,390,4.893939393939394
2876639,5,B000RXZL0E,"Who can ever forget this series. I still want to be Jeannie to this day.

If you have never seen this before you are missing ALOT.

I love the fact that this is innocent yet sexy.
The costumes are eye candy and the special effects were awesome for the day.
But most importantly it is HILARIOUS how Jeannie is always getting into one mess after the other often getting Major Nelson into trouble.

Jeannie's charachter is naive, yet smart, sexy and overly jealous of her Master(who freed her by the way when he opened that bottle).

Major Nelson is handsome, and good hearted and has finally learned that he cant control Jeannie and is coming to terms with his feelings for her.

Major Healy is his selfish yet lovable best friend(who knows about Jeannie).

Dr Bellows is the military space base psychiatrist who is always getting into trouble with all the Generals because he cant prove something is amiss with Major Nelson.

This season Jeannies mother shows up to give Major Nelson more misery.

Her dog shows up to bring havoc at the Space base.

Even her baby nephew makes an appearance on the show.

This is simply the best sitcom to ever hit the TV screen.

UP there with Little House and Quantum Leap.",1193529600,5,1207,4.567441860465117
2876640,3,B000RXZL0E,"I Dream of Jeannie is delightful nostalgia-- not classic, comedy TV (a la Dick Van Dyke Show) but still good fun.  Most of the humor is built around complications involving ""magical"" sight gags, which hold up today for their inventiveness, if not special effects.  Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman are effervescent as they romp through each half hour predicament created when ancient East (Jeannie) meets modern West (Cpt. Nelson).  I even enjoy taking in the set design details of the astronaut's apartment and wondering WHO decorated that place???  (In shag carpet, bottle glass partitions and avocado everything).  Pleasantly mindless entertainment-- waiting for the rest of the series on DVD.",1193097600,2,693,5.321100917431193
2876641,5,B000RXZL0E,"I Dream of Jeannie is just silly. But in our modern world where everything seems so bad, we need silly in our lives. Season Four begins where three left off, with well meaning Jeannie naively getting her beloved ""Master"" into more hot water. Tony can't manage to live a normal life with all Jeannie's efforts back-firing. Roger is still unbelievable as the most spaced-out astronaut ever. In fact, when Jeannie gets Tony in trouble, Roger's efforts to help just make it worse.

Season Four, like Seasons 1-3 doesn't solve any world problems, doesn't explore any important social issues, and certainly doesn't do much to improve the image of the astronauts. It doesn't try to. It was at the time taking a current popular hero and using him to take our minds off the burning political and social issues of the day. And in 2007, things aren't much better and we need a little silliness in our lives.",1193097600,14,896,4.707006369426751
2876642,4,B000RXZL0E,"Nothing can beat classic entertainment.
I must say, so far, my favorite episodes of this show would be found in the fourth disc of this season, because Tony and Jeannie's relationship really seems to transform here, they become a little more affectionate towards each other (which is just so nice to watch), and it gives the show a little more umph.

I really cannot wait to see them get married, their chemistry is exquisite, which is a key factor to the shows success.",1191628800,12,470,4.662650602409639
