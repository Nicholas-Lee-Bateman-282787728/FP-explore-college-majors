8312194,5,B001JAC5BC,"Michael Hordern sets a standard followed by Helen Mirren when she portrayed a female Prospero in recent years. This is an installment of the BBC TV Shakespeare that came out in the second season (1980, in the US). It used a BBC set made for Dr. Who. Hordern is majestic as Prospero. The choreography of the masques and dances of the spirits is very good. For any Shakespeare buff this is a must. I have the whole set of 37! These DVDs are marketed two ways. Each individually and some in sets. The disks that come in sets are sometimes defective, so it is better to get them in the individual format as this particular offering. Nigel Hawthorne plays the drunken butler Stephano, so one can see this famous actor in a piece that came out before he became largely famous in ""The Madness of King George."" I thoroughly enjoyed this version of ""The Tempest.""",1371859200,3,854,4.516129032258065
