1255250,5,B00002EQ0O,"Disney always makes top quality made for t.v. movies, but this one has made my top ten list! Buzzy Crocker is a reporter for a fake tabloid wich produces headlines such as, ""Frozen Ghost Found in Freezer."" Anna, his neice, askes if he ""Ever wanted to write something real"" and her questions were soon answered when an old woman came to him with the secret of why 5 hotel guests at The Hollywood Tower Hotel suddenly vanished from an elevator on Halloween, 1939. Buzzy and Anna go to the run down hotel only to find that it's haunted by the ghosts of the 5 people. When they befriend the ghosts and plan to help them get to the ""other world"", They find out that someone they know has evil intentions for the 5 souls. Can Buzzy and Anna stop them? Starring Steve Guttenberg as Buzzy and Kirsten Dunst as Anna, although this storyline may sound a bit corny, the movie is great and the plot is drawn out perfectly! Buy it today! This price is very reasonable and It's destined to become A disney Classic! It comes in a hard cover collectors case and is 89 minuites long.",988502400,9,1066,4.388888888888889

1255252,5,B00002EQ0O,"Disney has made an exceptionally good movie for ABC's ""The Wonderful World Of Disney."" I'm so glad they've lowered the price so that everyone can own it. The movie was made back in 1997 to advertise the opening of ""The Twilight Zone: Tower Of Terror"" ride at Disney's MGM Studios in Walt Disney World. But this movie was so good, I thought they should have put it in theaters. It's the story of a group of people who were traped in an elevator and plumited to their death. Among them was an child movie star. The hotel was closed down. Now it is 1997 and Buzzy (Guttenberg) is a struggling journalist. His neice (Dunst) Goes with him to the abandoned hotel to write a foney story about it, but they discover that the ghosts are real, and that the elevators crash wasn't an accident. It turns into a big mystery with a good ending. You really start to root for the characters. Buy it today. You'll love it!",983923200,26,905,4.392857142857143

When I first went on the ride in Disney World it was weird but when I saw the movie I understood it more. Now since I taped it I get to watch it before I go to Disney World. I think if you don't know what the ride is about, watch the movie first and then you get the idea. But the thrilling part is the drops cause I got to feel what it's like to be actors in the movie when they were falling when they went down. You really shouldn't miss this movie cause there is a lot of good effects in it, and a cool movie. ENJOY! :-)",981158400,,626,3.7142857142857144

It shows great shots of the Tower of Terror in Disney World (as far as I know that is where it was filmed and if it wasn't then they must've built a replica which i highly doubt).  It is not too scary for young children to watch but it still has a captivating story with twists and turns which attracts all ages.  This is something you should not miss!

1255258,5,B00002EQ0O,"Imagine, you were at the worlds most luxurious hotel, the Hollywood Tower Hotel. As you step into the elevator, you wave to the other guests, not knowing this was the last time you'd ever see that crowd again. You count  the floors as the elevator proceeds. Fifth floor, sixth floor, seventh,  eighth, ninth, tenth,-  The elevator lurches to a stop. The Bellboy frowns,  and punches the '11' button again. Something was wrong. Then the elevator  does move, but not upward. It falls,picking up speed by the minute. You're  nearing the ground. Then-
The Hotel is now closed. It is supposedly  haunted now. Only a few people know the real story. Was the strange event  just a freak of nature,- or did someone mean it to be that way?",947289600,4,729,4.640625

1255285,2,B00002EQ0O,"I wanted to like this movie I really did, but it was just awful. just to show you that i am trying to be objective I'll even go so far as to say Disney did a decent job to incorporate the actual characters from the TT ride at Disney, but that's as far as it goes. the story was weak, it had no connection to the Twilight Zone as did the ride. There was very little in the way of special effects, or fun spooky moments. The main thrust of the story was about a washed up journalist trying to get his career back. It was just a very weak story-line. The Tower of Terror ride offered screen writers so much opportunity, but this did not deliver. I thought my kids might be more forgiving however, my 12 year old daughter, who usually likes just about anything, gave it a thumbs down. Disney's Haunted Mansion movie was actually better than this and that's not saying much!",1477958400,,869,4.240963855421687

Filmed at Walt Disney World's MGM Studios Park where the actual Tower of Terror was (before California Adventure at Disneyland was built), this is a beautiful movie with a great cast of characters who make you laugh, and cry.

1255413,3,B00002EQ0O,"TOWER OF TERROR really isn't scary or terrifying. It's more of a mystery than a ghost story but there is still some fun in the film. The film seems mildly outdated and it's clear this was a TV film. The suspense builds and pauses and there is no question a commercial was meant to follow. It is somewhat annoying that the commercial pauses were not edited to keep the story flowing.

Steve Guttenberg stars as a tabloid reporter eager to rebuild his reputation as a real journalist. A young Kirsten Dunst adds some life into this ghost story. A strange mystery occurred in the Hollywood Hotel on Halloween 1939. Four passengers and the elevator operator simply vanished on their way up to a party on the top floor and were never seen again. One of the passengers was the top child actress of the day. The hotel has been closed ever since. The mystery was never solved. An elderly woman named Abigail claims to have the key to solving their disappearance and enlists the aid of Buzzy. Finally Buzzy has a true ghost story and mystery worthy of a respectable newspaper.

TOWER OF TERROR is a mild ghost story--nothing too scary for kids or adults. It's relatively fun and mindless but no great piece of entertainment.",1375833600,,1215,4.62037037037037

It also has the low-low budget feel of something made on the quick to capitalize on a showing at Halloween.  Not that any of that invalidates the work that went into this modest effort, the filmmakers did remarkably well with very little.  It also helped that they hired someone as likeable as Steve Guttenberg to play the lead.  Adding Kirsten Dunst bumped things up a notch or two, plus an amusing Michael McShane as the comic relief; they could have done worse (okay, Nia Peeples notwithstanding).  The story was passable with one exception, how did one of the characters get their hands on a book of spells and have the wherewithal to cast doom upon an elevator loaded with five unsuspecting souls?  What it takes in hatred to manage something like that, then hold the grudge for decades to finish the task, can't be absolved in seconds with a mere trinket; explained away as a simple misunderstanding.  That part of the story relies too heavily on human nature which wouldn't allow it to be dismissed so easily, dissolved in a happy ending for Disney sake.  But, in spite of that lapse in logic, it wasn't a terrible movie.  I found it entertaining enough to make it a Halloween tradition (I have to have something to watch at this time of year besides Hocus Pocus!).",1350345600,7,1403,4.6938775510204085

1255436,4,B00002EQ0O,"This is not a bad movie about yet another Disney Ride at their theme parks.  Steve Guttenberg, Kirsten Dunst, and Mia Peoples star in this movie about ""The Hollywood Tower Hotel"" that was closed mysteriously on their opening night in 1939.  Something bad happened in the elevator when a child star (looking alot like Shirley Temple), her nanny and a couple mysteriously died (vanished) while riding the elevator to the ""Tip Top Lounge"".  Many years later a reporter (Guttenberg) and his niece (Dunst) try to solve the mystery.  Along the way they encounter the ghosts who do not know what happened to them, but they just know that they became ghosts after seeing a bright flash in the elevator.  Mia Peeples is Guttenbergs boss in the movie and she and him had a romance in the past.  I won't give away the plot, however let me say the mystery is solved, Peeples and Guttenberg are in love again, and everything is A-Okay!  This is better than the ""Haunted Mansion"" that Eddie Murphy starred in.  This movie at least has a half-way interesting plot and the main characters are good in this movie compared to the ""Haunted Mansion"".

I found the movie and bought it for her in the hopes she would understand the story by watching it.  The movie came quickly after I ordered it and in great condition.

Even though the title may make it seem like there's a lot of terror in this movie, there isn't any real violence. A few moments might be a little scary or suspenseful for a young child not used to horror movies, but otherwise, nothing bad happens in the movie. As far as content for children goes, I would give this movie a thumbs up.

But even though you can watch it together as a family, I don't think you will even want to do that. When I watched it as a kid, I thought the beginning was interesting as it introduced us to the mystery, and when the mystery was getting solved, the movie held my attention too. But the events that happened in between those two times were rather boring. As an adult, I haven't appreciated the middle of the movie any more than I did before, and now I find the ending a little cheesy too.

Disney has produced a lot of great movies that children and their adults can both enjoy, but this is not one of them.

As a movie, it's a kid-friendly, not-too-scary thriller that features a young Kirsten Dunst (excellent, as usual), Steve Guttenberg in his lovable chump mode, stylish turns by the always-lovely Melora Hardin (of ""The Office"" and ""Monk"") and Scottish actor Alastair Duncan, and able support from an array of character actors. As ""Q,"" heir to the haunted hotel, Michael McShane steals every scene he's in.

1255461,2,B00002EQ0O,"First of all, I'd like to state that my 2-star rating is based on how I would rate this movie compared to all major motion picture movies, typically catering to teens and adults. However, I'll admit that maybe that's not a fair rating, considering this movie was made for kids. As a kid's movie, and judging by how much my girls (ages 3 and 6) enjoyed it, I would give it a 4-star rating.

I mainly purchased this movie to get my girls pumped up for an upcoming trip to Disneyland. (I chose this one, because my 6-year old now meets the height requirement for the Tower of Terror ride in the California Adventure park.) I was sort of skeptical that this movie would capture the attention spans of a 3 and 6-year old for 100 minutes, but it was cheap and it had a sort of lame, kitchy appeal to me anyway, so I bought it. I underestimated how much my girls would enjoy it. Although their attention spans wandered a little during some of the boring parts, they both thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and begged to watch it again after it was over. (Sorry girls...Daddy's about gouge his eyes out.)

Now a word about the star of the movie...Steve Guttenberg. Guttenberg always seems to land all the hottest movies. He's like a magnet to cinematic masterpieces like Police Academy, Amazon Women on the Moon, Overdrive, Zeus and Roxanne, Casper: A Spirited Beginning,...the list goes on and on.

Guttenberg and Dunst stand out, and Melora Hardin is so good I wonder why I haven't seen her in other films. The music is great - especially the big band scenes.  The opening shots have fantastic camera work to give the scenes a touch of spookiness and unease without overdoing it. The special effects are upper end TV special effects; okay, but not great.

1255478,3,B00002EQ0O,"Among all the Halloween-themed movies that overan television screens last month was this 1997 movie featuring rising A-list star Kirsten Dunst (who despite her young age has managed to rack up some impressive screen credits). Dunst plays niece to disgraced journalist Buzzy (played with frenetic energy by Steve Guttenberg) who is forced to concocting tabloid on a freelance basis and seeking that one more shot at redemption and at being taken seriously by his former colleagues.

For those of us who have taken a ride on that giant yo-yo ride at Disney MGM this movie brings back vivid memories about the plunging drop to the bottom only to be sprung back up again and again, but unfortunately that's about where my interest in the movie ended. The story seeks to provide some more background to the ride which should in itself be a warning light. With the definite exception of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" it certainly makes more sense to base a ride on a popular movie rather than the other way around. I was one person left blue and shaken by the ride (my girlfriend at the time expressed guilt at having persuaded me to take the plunge). But this weak production did little to inspire any emotion, other than a constant eye on the time to wonder when this overacted movie with a  telegraphed plot would come to an end.  There are no surprises here, we know who the main villain is from the start (which much like the equally predictable and easy-to-figure out early on 'Sixth Sense') the movie still tries to shroud as a twist ending.

Fans of Dunst will probably enjoy this movie and those who enjoy cheesy, bad horror movies may also get a good chuckle from this picture, but its hard to recommend a movie that treads down so many familiar plot lanes and fails to inspire an emotional involvement in the movie.",1099872000,5,1817,4.66875

Buzzy's been blacklisted from the ""real"" papers ever since one of his news-breaking stories proved to be false. Now Buzzy concocts most of his stories himself by dressing his lovely niece Anna (Kirsten Dunst) in ghost and Alien costumes, taking photos, and writing tales of shock and horror to go with them. But when an old spinster woman named Abigail Gregory from the local nut-house pays Buzzy a visit, he's off on the story of a lifetime, to solve the mystery of the Hollywood Tower Hotel, a story that's sure to get him back into the real newspaper business.
 It seems that back in Hollywood's heyday, Shirley Temple-like child star Sally Shine, her nanny Emeline Partridge, the hotel owner's bumbling bellhop son Dewey, aspiring singer Claire Poulet, and Claire's boyfriend Gilbert, all disappeared one Halloween night in the Hotel elevator on their way to a party on the top floor. Ever since that fateful night, the Hollywood Tower Hotel has been shut down, and whatever happened to those five unfortunate souls has been a mystery. But Abigail claims to know the secret. She was there that night, and she believes that Sally Shine's nanny was a witch! Insanely jealous of the child, Emeline Partridge cast a horrible spell over the girl, but the spell backfired and left the inhabitants of the elevator trapped in limbo, left to haunt the Hollywood Tower Hotel until the spell is finished, or broken. Only then will they meet their doom, or else be able to rejoin the party they had originally been on their way to, a ghostly party that still goes on every Halloween night in the hopes that the missing guests will finally arrive.
 Now Buzzy is on a mission, and finds himself picking up partners at every turn. First he enlists the help of his beautiful and spunky niece Anna, then recruits an odd ""dude"" named ""Q"" to help, since he IS the great grandson of the original owner AND the grandson of the missing bellhop. Before he knows it, former boss Jill Perry comes along for the ride, and the ghosts are eager to have the puzzle solved too.
 Disney's Tower of Terror is a great thrill ride of a TV movie, just like the actual ride it's based on, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park in Florida. The movie is great family entertainment, full of humor, some tame scares, superb music, and a great cast. Steve Guttenberg is likeable as always, and Kirsten Dunst is as dreamy as ever, even if they did make her dress-down and tighten back her beautiful hair for most of the film. Tower of Terror is a must own video for any fan of the cast, the Disney theme parks, or fun, family films in general.

  The story line starts when a reporter looking for a job (known to us as *buzzy*) gets a visit from an elderly woman, Abigail. She's seen his articles on the supernatural (which are all hoaxed with the help of his niece, Anna) and wants him to find out what really happened in 1939- when 5 people (including the famous actress Sally Shine) disapeared on an elevator. She suspects it was the witchcraft of Sally's nanny- Ms. Partridge- that made them all... disapear.
  And so Buzzy and Anna set off to the old hotel to find the truth about what happened that night with the help of one a bumbling mechanic (who's ancestor was the bellhop who disapeared on that fateful night in 1939) and a beautiful actress- Miss Claire Poolay (the actress Buzzy got to play the part of Ms. Partridge- remember, he's turning this story into a phony one) and of course Abigail, doing research at home.
  But soon enough, they encounter the ghosts of the hotel. And when the ghosts are encountered, they find out the truth. Exactly what they had been hired to do. But the truth is different than they expected.
  I really loved this great movie! It has tons of 'secret identidies,' and your thoughts on the characters change throughout the movie. Like first you think of ____ as a nice lady/gentleman but by the late middle you think of her/him as a crazy person!

With the help of his neice, Anna, he discovers that the spirits of the 5 people still live in the hotel and that they are the only ones that can help them. Will Buzzy sacrifice his career to help some old ghosts? Everyone I know whos seen it loved it no matter what age they are!

I get chills when I watch that part...the cast was wonderful, Kirsten Dunst was perfect for the role of Anna...and so was Steven Guttenburg as Buzzy...the whole story was not corney as I thought a Disney movie's ""scary"" movie would be...the characters like Mrs. Partridge and Gilbert, the snobby actor, and the beautiful Claire Poulet...you've all gotta see this...even grown-ups, it's also a VERY good mystery!",988502400,,554,5.032608695652174

My daughter and I both found this to be a very enjoyable movie and we watch it often, even when it is nowhere near Halloween time. The plot is fun, it is definitely not a scary movie, but perfect for those of us who prefer a classic ghost story with a happy ending. Great for the Halloween spirit no matter your age.
