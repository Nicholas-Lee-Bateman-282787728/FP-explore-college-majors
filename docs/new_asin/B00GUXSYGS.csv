6118738,5,B00GUXSYGS,A good movie about a young man needs to do to make the perfect Christmas for him and his family. He has many chances to try. Christmas day will repeat itself many times through out this movie. I liked the movie and would recommend this to everyone.,1414195200,,248,4.297872340425532

6118740,4,B00GUXSYGS,"Pete, the middle child, has his worst Christmas ever. and is forced to repeat it every day.  Similar theme to Groundhog Day with Bill Murrey.  The movie was good in acting but exemplary in story.  People change for the better but in a very real way.  This is a very good movie for families especially if there is a middle child.",1390435200,,328,4.327868852459017
6118741,5,B00GUXSYGS,"14 year old Pete keeps repeating Christmas day with hilarious outcomes.  The movie is so well acted by the entire cast including Bruce Dern as the crusty grandpa.  But Zachary Gordon's portrayal as Pete, the middle child is so heartwarming and funny. This is a likeable family everyone can identify with and the characters are very well written.  The ensemble cast includes Bailee Madison as the next door neighbor who just moved in. Pete keeps trying to ""fix"" Christmas and learns valuable lessons along the way. This is quickly becoming my favorite Christmas movie.  It is a film the entire family can enjoy. ""Pete's Christmas"" is a delight with wonderful messages throughout the story.  I highly recommend this movie!",1388275200,2,720,5.016806722689076

8627700,5,B00GUXSYGS,"I watched this movie on Netflix, and I like it so much that that I ordered it on Amazon. The movie had a plot that even though it has been done before was very well written. The acting and the life lessons in the film were done in an entertaining way. This is a great family film. This movie will be a regular in our house.",1449792000,,323,3.909090909090909

8627702,5,B00GUXSYGS,good movie,1447286400,,10,4.5
8627703,5,B00GUXSYGS,"I happen to LOVE Time Travel and Time-loop movies. This is the latter, ala ""GROUNDHOG DAY"".
Actually, it is a Christmas favorite of mine.
SOME things in life ARE understandable... ""Pete"" outgrew his childhood career as being THE child
in DIARY OF A WIMPY KID 1-3... and his---heart-throb---next door neighboor was maturing as the
cameras rolled. Never mind THAT, this is a truly---maybe NOT an original idea---but an entertaining
film nonetheless, with a GREAT turn by veteran actor Bruce Dern as the grumpy-gramps.
What I DON'T understand is why it costs LESS for this BD a-n-d DVD when the stand-alone DVD
is a lot more.",1441584000,,622,4.933333333333334
8627704,5,B00GUXSYGS,"Good Christmas program based on as Bill Murray in ""Ground Hog Day"" where each day repeats it's self. Stars Zackary Gordon and Bailee Madison. Was on the Hallmark Channel for Christmas 2014.",1439164800,,189,4.9375
8627705,5,B00GUXSYGS,We very much enjoyed this movie.  It's kinda like Ground Hog Day for this boy who it takes time to get it but it was good.,1434326400,,122,3.6923076923076925
