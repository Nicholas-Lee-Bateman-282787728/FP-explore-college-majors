2028849,5,B0001VTPU4,Another movie from the Jaclyn Smith collection that I have been searching for and finding on Amazon for this price was well worth the wait it the condition of the Dvd was great,1367193600,,176,4.363636363636363
2028850,2,B0001VTPU4,I was facinated by the topic and cast.  I really like J.Smith and S.Wiinters.  This movie was middle-of-the-road at best.,1314921600,,121,5.0
2028851,4,B0001VTPU4,Jaclyn Smith was great in this movie; it was very romantic and heartwarming as well; the costume designs made it a period piece as well,1305676800,,135,4.44
2028852,4,B0001VTPU4,"This is a very good mystery with a reincarnation motif reminescent of DEAD AGAIN.  The cast is great especially SHELLY WINTERS and CLAIRE BLOOM, but JACLYN SMITH seemed a little weak in her role.  I recommend.",1287446400,3,209,4.777777777777778
2028853,2,B0001VTPU4,Was really looking forward to this.  But lord has time changed so much?  The plot devices were so corny it was almost unbelievable.  I'm sorry to say but Shelly Winters was the only redeeming factor in this otherwise ridiculous drama.,1250467200,,234,4.8
2028854,1,B0001VTPU4,"I am sorry I wasted my money on this film.  I bought it because I like Jaclyn Smith, but it was not a film I would have expected her to make.  It was a strange film and,I felt, rather crude.",1209340800,,190,3.725
2028855,3,B0001VTPU4,"The end of the movie is something tricky, I would say forced; apart from this, a good movie.",1179187200,,92,4.166666666666667
2028856,5,B0001VTPU4,"This movie is one of the best I've seen in a while. For movie lovers of this genre, this one for us!

It's about an exploration of the mysteries of the past, the passion, jealousies, love and murder.

This is not your typical hollywood drama with a twist. Being directed by BAFTA award-winning cinematographer Anthony Richmond, you'll know you're up with something very British and fans of this genre won't be disappointed at all.

Beautifully directed, gorgeous scenery, costumes, haunting music and wonderful performances by the leads are among the big factors to consider when you buy this small gem on dvd.

Actors Nigel Terry (Excalibur) and Jaclyn Smith (The Bourne Identity) are excellent in this romantic/thriller based from the bestselling novel ALWAYS by Trevor Meldal-Johnsen.

Jaclyn Smith is, I must say, astoundingly beautiful in a dual role. I'll take her anytime as a ""blonde"" and the ending is one of the most satisfying Ive seen in so many years. It will haunt you down....waiting for more.

A must see in your dvd collection!",1112486400,14,1044,4.971264367816092
2028857,3,B0001VTPU4,"This hybrid film is after being a Mystery Romance Gothic Horror Thriller Melodrama, not entirely successful throughout in any category but overall an intriguing effort.  Based upon the novel, ""Always"", by Trevor Meldel-Johnsen, the London-set affair features Nigel Terry in a dual role as mid-1980s writer Gregory Thomas, and as an earlier manifestation sharing his soul, Michael Richardson, a mid-1930s ballet choreographer.  During the course of a viewing by Gregory and his fiance Maggie (Jaclyn Smith) in a local theatre of a documentary concerning tragically killed ballerina Brooke Ashley, Gregory is startled by the close resemblance between the two women.  After some research, he decides to pen a screenplay of the dancer's life and sudden death by fire, but quickly discovers that the shifting sands of time have obfuscated much that he needs to know.  He discovers as well that a substantial portion of his new work appears to exist within his subconscious mind, and that the mystery of reincarnation apparently lies at the root of what becomes for him an uncomfortable search.  His delving into the history of Brooke Ashley leads him to contact an old psychic and hypnotist, Olga (Shelley Winters), an intimate of the dancer, and whose home is a shrine to her, and a coalescence of interests occurs between Gregory and the medium.  Although Olga guides him to ""see"" into his prior existence as Richardson, resultant discoveries become rife with a sense of terror and danger.  Terry's performance is sensitively crafted, and Claire Bloom, although she is used too sparingly, is also excellent, as the manipulative mother who attempts to end the happiness of the original pair of lovers, while Winters and Smith perform ably.  Filmed in London and Paris, with dance footage at the former city's Drury Lane Theatre, the film is the only directoral outing from cinematographer Anthony Richmond and is garnished by the accurate designing of Tony and Joanne Woollard, along with costumes of Marit Allen, each of whom perfectly contrasts the half-century apart eras, and there is a romantic score tendered by Pino Donaggio.  The dance scenes are rather shabbily directed and performed, while the script becomes quite incoherent during the film's final portions, but then the original book is, after all, one in which ambiguity is triumphant, and a splendid air of romantic fantasy graces the production.",1106006400,,2408,5.217616580310881
2028858,5,B0001VTPU4,"I rented this film based on its plot description, with moderate expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was!
Nigel Terry is superb in his portrayal of a writer-going-mad and it is always wonderful to see Charlie's Angel Jaclyn Smith on the screen. Both actors play dual roles-- Smith is ""Maggie"", an actress in the present (the mid-1980's) and ""Brooke"", an acclaimed ballerina in the flashback sequences (the mid-1930's); Terry is ""Greg"", a writer in the present, and ""Michael"" a wealthy choreographer who works and falls in love with ""Brooke"". The two stories are joined by Greg's fascination with Maggie's uncanny resemblance to Brooke and the mysterious death of Michael and Brooke.
As soon as Greg begins researching the facts around the events that took place 50 years earlier, with the help of Shelly Winters as ""Olga"", a hypnotist and psychic, he soon discovers that he is Michael reincarnated, and that Maggie is... reincarnated herself! Does she possess the spirit of Brooke? Or someone entirely different? (You'll have to watch it to see!)
All of the actors give a fine performance, and the set and costume designers do a fantastic distinguishing between the two time periods of the film. All of which takes place in beautiful England. DEJA VU is a multi-genre film-- part love story and part mystery/suspense-- and it is executed in an almost Hitchcockian manner by giving the audience the right amount of information to intrigue them, without ever completely explaing every detail. If you're a viewer who doesn't like to make your own conclusions, then this may not be a film for you; but for those of you who appreciate this style of storytelling, then watch this today!",1087344000,21,1708,4.996491228070176

8016731,5,B0001VTPU4,"I liked this movie very much. The story is interesting and the actors are wonderful. Jaclyn Smith is beautiful in her dual role. Nigel Terry, as in Excalibur"" is handsome and acts really well. Shelley Winters is excellent. Claire Bloom, in a small role as the mother of Jaclyn Smith, is very good. The film is from 1985 and is quite good.",1380499200,2,338,4.467741935483871
