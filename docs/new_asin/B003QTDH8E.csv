4171888,5,B003QTDH8E,"What a great surprise to see McMillan and Wife Season 2. I have waited years after
buying Season 1.  I could not understand why it took so long to continue to release the series on DVD.

I have watched all seven episodes and they were great. In the 1970's great series
were released.  Not only special actors were in the series, but the photography
and stories were perfect to keep you glued to the TV and enjoy every minute.

Please Universal, keep releasing the seasons for us. I want all seven seasons in
my library to watch when I want special entertainment.

Rock Hudson,as Police Commissioner, Stewart McMillan, Susan Saint James, as Sally
McMillan, John Schuck, as Sgt. Charles Enright, and the special Nancy Walker, as
Mildred can never be replaced. You will love McMillan and Wife in San Francisco!",1287187200,24,807,4.735714285714286
4171889,5,B003QTDH8E,"As a kid in the 70's, I loved the NBC Mystery Movie shows. There was, the perceived top dog Columbo, McMillan and McCloud were always seen as the lesser spoke in the wheel. As the series expanded to additional nights on the NBC schedule, Banacek, Snoop Sisters, Quincy and Lanigan's Rabbi were other spokes that enjoyed differing levels of success. McMillan was always my favorite. The show reeked of class and gave us that super sexy Nixon-era chick, Susan St. James. I was so thrilled when this second season came out. It's classic McMillan. Big name guest stars populate the episodes. Night of the Wizard, the season premier was loads of fun, as was Cop of the year. Who knew Enright had a wife? I also liked Terror times Two. Seeing Rock play two roles, Mac, of course and the criminal posing as Mac was great fun. I've not watched all the episodes, as I'm making them last. There are only 7, but it is a reminder to me of just how great tv was in the past. The shows of today just don't measure up. I think to a large part, it's cos there are so many channels and the content just doesn't have to be developed so completely. McMillan has a lot of style, and the characters relate so well to each other. You really feel you're with old friends. Hopefully we won't have to wait another 5 years for a 3rd season McMillan release. The good news is, in January? we'll have the complete Snoop Sisters series. Sadly, there are only 4 episodes of that.",1286496000,40,1449,4.41044776119403

4171900,5,B003QTDH8E,"This four disc set contains 7 episodes from the 1972-73 season.  The episodes are Night of the Wizard/Blues for Sally M, Cop of the Year/Terror Times Two, No Heart's No Flowers/The Fine Art of Staying Alive, and Two Dollars on Trouble to Win.  The picture quality is very good for a series over 40 years old.  There are some great guest stars including:  John Astin, Eileen Brennan, Keir Dullea, Edie Adams, and Charles Nelson Reilly.  The charm of Mcmillan & Wife is not really the mystery but the chemistry between the main cast Rock Hudson, Susan St. James, Nancy Walker and John Schuck.

4171904,5,B003QTDH8E,I loved this show when it originally aired on NBC in the 70's. So glad it was available on DVD. My Teenage daughter actually thought it was pretty cool when she watched it.

4171917,3,B003QTDH8E,"The elements that made McMillan and Wife a hit are still in place, and stars Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James seem to be more comfortable with each other, but although there are some bright spots, the overall quality of stories in season two are just a little below par.  The fine cast and the impressive list of guest stars are generally not to blame, as the reasons for this rest firmly with the writing, which seems a bit off track at times.

Following the adventures of San Francisco police Commissioner Stuart ""Mac"" McMillan (Hudson), and his intrepid wife Sally (Saint James), the series had reintroduced the husband and wife crime solving team to prime time television.  Rounding out the cast is John Schuck as Mac's right hand man, sergeant Charles Enright, and Nancy Walker as the couple's acerbic housekeeper Mildred.

The season opens with one of the weaker stories.  ""Night of the Wizard"" is a goofy ghost tale, where a woman is contacted by the spirit of her dead husband, who accuses her of killing him.  Featuring a sance and ghostly apparitions, mediums and magicians, this kind of paranormal tale has been done before.  As a real person is obviously responsible rather than a ghost, the suspense rather minimal, but Cameron Mitchell and Sharon Acker are terrific overplaying their roles.

There are just seven episodes in the season, and kidnapping is featured prominently in two of them.  In ""Double Trouble"", Mac is abducted by the mob so that a double can take his place.  This already clichd device had become overused in espionage and crime programs, like Mission Impossible in particular.  Many of the situations seem very familiar, as Mac makes a dramatic escape, and confronts his double.  In the bizarre ""The Fine Art of Staying Alive"", Sally is kidnapped and ransomed for a priceless painting.  It's a pretty far out scenario, but the quick witted Sally provides an obscure clue, that eventually contributes to her rescue, as Mac goes back in time to the day he proposed to her.

One of the more engaging episodes is ""No Hearts, No Flowers"", where Sally is being stalked by persons unknown.  Mac and Enright follow her daily activities looking for clues to the stalker's identity.  With a number of suspects, and some quirky story elements, this one keeps you guessing up until a twisted, although somewhat dubious conclusion.  ""Blues For Sally M"" is another instance of weird obsession, and delusional fantasy.  Keir Dullea (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B004L9GMBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>) guests as a musician who dedicates a composition to Ms. McMillan.  Those with an observant eye may see what is coming rather early.

""Cop of the Year"" is one of the best and perhaps more memorable of stories from this season, as Sergeant Enright is at a dinner being honored as the Policeman of the Year, when his ex-wife Monica (Lorraine Gary) unexpectedly makes an appearance.  While they are alone in a room, a shot rings out, and Enright draws his gun.  When Mac and the party goers break into the room, Monica has been shot, and later arrives at the hospital DOA, leaving Enright facing a murder charge.

While there are some good moments and instances of clever writing, with a few uninspired stories and repetitious themes, the second season of McMillan and Wife is a little uneven, and a slight step down from the best that the series has to offer.  How close some of the storylines run to each other, is more noticeable when the episodes are viewed in close proximity.  When Columbo, one of the most well-written programs in television history, is your regular competition, you really need to be at the top of your game, and that just isn't the case here.  The chemistry between the characters remains special, and fans will certainly want to get this set, however casual mystery lovers might want to start elsewhere, perhaps with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McMillan-Wife-Season-5/dp/B004VK74EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McMillan & Wife: Season 5</a>, which has some stronger stories.",1338336000,,4155,5.2105263157894735
4171918,2,B003QTDH8E,"This item was below the quality I expected.  I had ordered season I and it was fine.  This item, however, is very ""grainy"" with dark spots appearing in several of the episodes.

4171919,4,B003QTDH8E,"Season Two was quite interesting in regards to the fact that it seemed to use more of the old classic mystery theme concepts for it's plots. Episode 1 reminded me of all those old B&W films where the villains where involved psychic plots. Episode 3 used the closed box concept where there was no way anyone else could have committed the murder. Episode 4 had the old switch a character plot, which sadly I seemed to find the least interesting of all the episodes. The rest follow the tried and true plots of psychopaths in love, kidnappers, someone is out to scare a friend, and etc. The good things are that there is less development needed for this season so you can just jump right into the stories, the costumes look less 60ish, & luckily there was no appearance of a baby as practically promised from the previous seasons final episode. I never think a baby, kid, or even animals,for the most part, help with the plots for main characters in mystery shows. Unless you are Charlie Chan or Nick Charles that is of course. A good buy and a quality intro any mystery buffs collection.",1328400000,,1085,4.540816326530612

Must see>",1312761600,,141,4.423076923076923
4171923,5,B003QTDH8E,"It has been wonderful to see this series again after all these years.  I quite agree with the other comments that this is television of a calibre that is sadly no longer made.

To me this series scores with the people, the place and the era, as well as the light-hearted humour.  Even the scripts are engaging (and sometimes quite complicated - e.g. The Night of the Wizard).  Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James radiate a cosy glow, with the most charming on-screen marriage I can recall ever having seen.  And who can forget dear old John Schuck as the goofy but dependable Sgt Enright.  I especially liked the episode 'Blues for Sally M'.

San Francisco is always very photogenic of course, and to anyone who has spent any time there, I think it has a kind of magical 'this is the place to be' quality.  The 1970s was a fantastic era to see it.

Slightly disappointed to see the beautiful title sequence of the 1st series didn't continue into the 2nd (I assume this was how the series was made - and not a DVD production edit?).

Also disappointed that, as with so many other series, a European release is nowhere in sight.  Thank goodness for a region-free player.  Years ago, when Season 1 was first released there was a Region 2 version of that one, which I purchased, but it has a fault on the production master for one of the episodes, and after 3 or 4 exchanges with the retailer, I just gave in and accepted it, as the series is (just) worth tolerating this.

Savour this series - it's one of a kind.

Silly thought - I'm guessing it was originally filmed on celluloid, which means a blu-ray release would be feasible - yes please!!",1303948800,7,1640,4.441471571906354
4171924,5,B003QTDH8E,"Before ""Hart to Hart"" and ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" there was ""McMillan and Wife"", Rock Hudson's first forray into series television. The series, more like a telefilm that aired on a rotation basis with others films like ""Columbo"" on NBC's ""Sunday Mystery Movie"", was an instant hit making Hudson millions and making him known to a whole new generation of viewers who had never seen his motion pictures.

 Hudson played Stewart NcMillan and Susan Saint James played his slightly dimwitted wife Sally who solved crimes together with the beautiful city of San Francisco as its backdrop. Nancy Walker had a great supporting role as the McMillan's funny housekeeper.

 The following is a list of season two's telefilms, 7 in all, that have a running time of approximately 90 minutes, along with their airdates. There are also no bonus features.

Why is the season 2 set currently unavailable?  VEI just released it at the end of August and already it is no longer available through Amazon or Amazon Canada.  Odd.  I contacted  tvshowsondvd.com website  and was informed that they don't know what has happened to season 2.  In fact,  the tvshowsondvd. com writers weren't even aware that season 2 was off market until my email.  Also tried to check what is happening through VEI's website and discovered that the site is under construction.

It continues to be frustrating that a series as well-done and popular as ""McMillan and Wife""  was not produced, distributed, and sold by a more reliable and capable company then VEI.

The chemistry is great during the 1st few seasons, but the writing from then on makes them appear a little snarky and bitter. The writing is awful. ""Mac"" is by far the most clueless chief of police you've ever encountered (for the sake of filling out the 2 hour episodes). The sexual innuendo is blatant and remarkable during the early years. The highlight of every show is Nancy Walker - who is always funny, making the most out of the sometimes lame writing. Good for a laugh. but don't expect to be scared, or have any sense of mystery.
