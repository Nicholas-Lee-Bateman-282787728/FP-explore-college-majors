8392177,5,B0039NOAZQ,I had this movie in a VHS and my 3 older grandchildren loved it so I bought it in DVD for my fourth grandchild to enjoy.,1377820800,,120,3.6538461538461537
8392178,5,B0039NOAZQ,"This is another video that my son cannot seem to get enough of, we also have ""Discovering the ABCS's"".  He absolutely loves this video and watches it for hours.  My son has an obsession with cars and wheels, so this was a perfect fit for him.  It teaches about safety and so much more in a way where my son can understand and we can appreciate.  I decided to get this after reading the other great reviews and I am so glad I did.  I am, we are, now fans of Fisher Price.  I mean we were before as my son has had and still has so many Fisher Price toys since birth to now, he is 4.  So I like the fact that they have a good approach to education overall.
Great toys, excellent videos, excellent products.  Five stars all the way.",1376352000,,728,4.041958041958042
8392179,5,B0039NOAZQ,"We had the DVD since we watched a baby 5 years ago, she loved it and we played it over and over. She got to the point she would put it in the DVD player by herself.  It got played so much that it didn't work very good any more and we are happy to get another one for her.  We still get to see her and calls me Pop Pop.",1354665600,,318,3.464788732394366
8392180,5,B0039NOAZQ,This came free with a toy and I never thought much about it. I popped it in the dvd player one afternoon and he sat through the entire thing - TWICE!!! This was the first time he ever sat still and watched something for more than 5 minutes. It is a collection of short little movies with great music. I look forward to purchasing additional Little People videos for our collection!,1278547200,2,381,4.380281690140845
