7889205,3,630529304X,"Strictly reserved to Charles S. Chaplin aficionados, the Madacy CHAPLIN #1 DVD presents three movies featuring the genius in his early period. Firstly, CRUEL, CRUEL LOVE, shot in 1914, has one of the tiniest arguments of all Chaplin comedies : he is impersonating a member of the High Society who believes falsely to have swallowed poison. Great facial show of Chaplin !
A FILM JOHNNY (1914) is the least interesting of the three movies. Chaplin, as The Tramp, enters a cinema studio and causes a general fight. Nothing new under the sun.
TRIPLE TROUBLE (1918) presents Charles Chaplin, as The Tramp, and some of the Keystone Cops in a story involving spies, politicians, beggars and... bombs. A little bit confusing but you feel that there's a real gap between this movie and the two first films.
Now the DVD. ... . Images are awful with cuts and so many white spots that, for example, in CRUEL, CRUEL LOVE, you cannot, in certain occasions, understand what you see because there are more white spots than impressed pellicle on your screen. The music could have been average if only it wasn't the same tune playing again, again and again...
A DVD strictly reserved for Chaplin fans waiting for a better transfer.",1055808000,,1213,4.8086124401913874
