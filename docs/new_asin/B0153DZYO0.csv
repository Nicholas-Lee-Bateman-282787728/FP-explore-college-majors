8732556,5,B0153DZYO0,"At first glance this series did not appeal to me. But I started watching the first episode and soon found myself hooked. The characters were strong, and the plot was peeled back in a very interesting and realistic manner. I soon found myself wrapped up into the season 1, however this has raised my expectation for season 2. Great Flick well worth the watching.  I would not have thought that I would have enjoyed such a flick.",1492732800,,427,4.545454545454546

8732561,4,B0153DZYO0,"This is a very successful British miniseries featuring Suranne Jones of Scott & Bailey.  In some ways this is a star vehicle for her, since she is in nearly every scene except for one or two in the final episode.  She plays Dr. Gemma Foster, a physician in Parminster.  One day she finds a long blonde hair on her husbands clothing and suspects him of infidelity.  In the course of 5 55-minute episodes she investigates his behavior and plots her revenge.  The genre is that of a psychological thriller, with crime fiction elements.  Not only is Gemma playing an elaborate game of psychological chess, she is also discovering things (both good and bad) about her own capabilities and instincts.

The story is very engaging and the acting is strong.  Neil Stuke (Billy, from Silk) appears, as well as the fine British character actor, Robert Pugh.  There is talk of a second season for the show, but that is hard to imagine (aesthetically), since each of Gemmas relationships has changed in the course of this season.  I would expect a significant departure from this seasons plot lines.

I was a little surprised by the British hype for the show because it has one glaring problem: none of the characters are, ultimately, likeable.  Perhaps we can chalk this up to realism (we all have our flaws) but it is very difficult to sustain interest under these conditions, particularly when the story line involves as much suffering as this one does.  This is not a fatal problem with the show, but it reduces the pleasure that we might have had.

N.B.: this is a Region 2 version and will not play on a U.S. dvd player.  The good news is that all-regions players are now readily available and you need not program them for different regions.  You simply pop in the dvd, the player reads it, and you sit back and enjoy.  Amazon sells all-regions players.  I recommend those made by Pioneer (because I have had good luck with two of them and they are reasonably priced).  In the case of Doctor Foster, the U.K. set is approximately half the price of this U.S. release.  This is often the case, so that the $100 or so that the all-regions player will cost you will be recouped very quickly.  Not only can you comparison-shop, but you will have access to U.K. programming that is not released in the U.S.  (A number of key British showsDalziel & Pascoe, e.g.will be available through Holland.)",1449446400,4,2383,4.650717703349282
