8352017,4,B00265S9C8,"I am a big fan of Cooks Illustrated and America's Test Kitchen and have purchased several of their cookbooks. I like to watch the shows and feel like I learn a lot from them. Unlike a lot of cooking shows which just go through making a particular recipe, these programs are more general and teach techniques which can be used not only for the dishes they demonstrate but also to make other similar things.

Since I found that all the seasons are available on DVD at my local public library, I have been going through them again from the beginning. It turns out that Season 6 is one of my favorites. I like it because of its international flair, with many specialties from other countries. For example, under eggs you have a quiche and a fritatta. They cover salsa with tacos and quesadillas. There is black bean soup and a tortilla soup. There is a risotto and a paella with sangria. There is an Indian curry and a Thai curry. There is chicken teriyaki and fettucine alfredo.

You'll also find some more familiar American treatments of pasta, pork and chicken, and what could be more American than deep-dish apple pie or a birthday cake. I found lots to learn and enjoy here. The only slight flaw is this set for me in all these older seasons is in the inclusion of some product and equipment reviews which are now a bit out of date. Some of the kitchen equipment they review is no longer for sale as newer models come out and older models are discontinued. Likewise, some food products they recommend are not available in my area.",1342656000,,1531,4.503597122302159
8352018,5,B00265S9C8,"We love America's Test Kitchen at our house. We have only purchased season 6 on DVD and we're disappointed with the packaging but love the show.

The DVD plastic parts fell off the box within the first 20 minutes of owning the product. The glue just didn't hold (admittedly, they're showing season 11, so it's got to be 5 year old glue by now).

What appears to be an eyelash was laminated into the box along with some other odd black splotches.

Everything look perfect from the outside.

The show, however, is great. A host and a few chefs give you the outcome of a scientific study of the best way to make a certain dish. What you learn is what works, what doesn't work and why. You'll also learn some of the best things to buy at the store -- and often it's not the most expensive.
