8567544,5,B00BF374JQ,"I have now watched (twice each) three different DVDs that cover different aspects of the development of the atomic bomb.  These include (1) History Channel's ""Modern Marvels: Manhattan Project"", (2) ""The Day After Trinity"", and now (3) National Geographic's ""Secret History of the Atom[ic] Bomb"".

I can recommend all three--all were top-notch educational documentaries with minimal political bias forced on the viewer except in a secondhand sense in ""The Day After Trinity"".  While moral considerations were not avoided in any of the versions, bomb development was the theme for each.  In part you are presented with the troubling conflicts of some of the personnel involved, but you are not subjected to stories that were heavily slanted one way or the other (again with the possible exception of ""Trinity"").  These DVDs are not dedicated studies in moral, social, or spiritual responsibility, but rather they recount facts about the project and in some cases the consequences.

(1)  The ""Manhattan Project"" focuses on the U.S. effort and the massive U.S. mobilization to develop nuclear weapons with the eye on their specific use for World War II.  In this version you will get the best understanding of the scope and progress of the Manhattan project itself, as the name aptly implies.  Facts such as the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, facility consuming 10% of the total U.S. electrical power output at the time contribute to tell a story of a time when a sense of purpose had captured a nation.  Whether or not you agree with that purpose is not the point, but rather this is the documented study of such a time and effort.  Of the 3 DVDs, this one touches the most on some of the technical considerations regarding nuclear fission.

(2)  ""The Day After Trinity"" focuses primarily on the life and involvement of J. Robert Oppenheimer who was given the task of leading and guiding the Manhattan Project to produce the bomb.  (Trinity was the name of the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico.)  This is a character study interwoven with the project itself to provide a more encompassing review of what transpired before, during, and after the project.  Political issues are raised from the viewpoints of scientists, and to me it seems that these tremendously brilliant people can at the same time be childishly naive politically...trusting that if we shared the science with potential enemies that goodwill would prevail.  While this DVD in one sense is about Oppenheimer in that it provides a backdrop of information concerning him, there are only a few words spoken by Oppenheimer himself that are taken from old film clips.  This version borders on being tedious as you wade through the commentaries of other scientists involved in the project, yet strangely enough you come away with a shared lasting impression of the Los Alamos experience.  This version is the one I would least recommend except as a review of involved personnel and their somber reflections.

(3)  Secret History of the Atom Bomb is the most current of the threeand consequently the most frightening when you better understand the proliferation of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons--and how we got to where we are now.  This version is the least detailed regarding technical and developmental aspects, but it is the most relevant historical and time-line study that sets the stage for what we are facing in the world today.  This version is also the one that makes it most clear that the U.S. was not alone in the quest for the bomb, but rather that we happened to be the first to produce it.  There is no question that I will recommend this to others, although this does not diminish the value of the other two versions.

As a final note, consider that there have now been over 1,200 nuclear tests performed.  Hydrogen bombs have followed atomic bombs, and the largest hydrogen bomb tested to date was reportedly 4,000 times more powerful than the atomic bombs that completely destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Technology that was once shrouded in secrecy is now known by many.  Between governments and spies divulging secrets to others, all that is really needed today by those with the available expertise to construct a bomb is sufficient weapons-grade material.  No longer is MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) a precarious but effective deterrent.  Watching this DVD will drive that point home.",1428278400,15,4368,5.001383125864454
