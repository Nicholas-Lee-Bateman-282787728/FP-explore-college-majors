2069635,2,B00029J2U8,"I have to admit it, I like Leslie Nielson. His performances over a broad range of parodies and spoofs have been excellent. Everything from the Naked Gun movies to the unheralded 2001 a Space Travesty is in my movie watching rotation. I feel bad, he's approaching the age of 80 now, and his movie making days are coming to a slow halt.

I also have to admit that I knew Nielson had a serious acting career before he found fame as a comedy actor. You might remember one of his serious roles as the captain of the ship in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and played Commander John Adams in my favorite 50's sci-fi flick ""The Forbidden Planet."" If you ever get the chance, see ""Day of the Animals."" Let's just say there's a scene with Nielson and a bear, funny as hell, it wasn't supposed to be.

However, very rarely is it that I find myself looking at a serious film that is starring Leslie Nielson. Project: Kill was just such a movie, and this movie flops, despite an excellent effort by Nielson.

In fact, Nielson's serious acting ability bounces well off of the collection of terrible performances that surround him. He plays this chemically enhanced secret agent that rebels against his organization and goes into hiding. Of course, the ""agency"" sends his apprentice, played pathetically by Gary Lockwood, to hunt him down.

Unfortunately, this film never gets going. It's carried by Nielson the entire time, but even he couldn't save this work.

Seriously, I was paying close attention, I don't think anything important happened. Here are my notes while watching this film:

-Character introduction, Nielson's escape, tolerable.

-20 min nothing important has happened yet...

-35 min still waiting...

-42 min romantic introduction, superfluous

-45 min nothing important

-60 min some people died, not interesting

-72 min Kinda hungry

-80 min Lockwood unbearable

-annoying soundtrack

Yeah, that's right, nothing important happened at all. The character development they tried failed, the storyline was both confusing and ridiculous, and the martial arts scenes were mechanical and slow, even by the standards of the time.

This film is completely unmemorable.",1115424000,2,2161,5.02808988764045

2069637,2,B00029J2U8,"Directed by horror-meister, William Girdler (THREE ON A MEAT-HOOK, ABBY, GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS, THE MANITOU), the thriller, PROJECT: KILL (1976) stars Leslie Nielsen (DAY OF THE ANIMALS, CREEPSHOW) as John Trevor, head trainer of hit-men for the title project. Now, Trevor has had enough, and he wants out. So, he uses his karate and escapes to Manila. After reconnecting w/ old friends, all seems rose-y.  Unfortunately, John happens to be going through withdrawal from years of mind control drugs. Not surprisingly, John's ex-bosses aren't very willing to let him go, and they dispatch operatives to eliminate him. Karate and death ensue. Meanwhile, Trevor's  withdrawal episodes grow continually worse. For a thriller, PROJECT: KILL is rather hum-drum. Even the fight scenes and homicides elicit little more than droopy eyelids. The lunk-headed dialogue doesn't help, any more than the meandering plot. Nielsen isn't bad, but does nothing spectacular either. Sub-par through and through. Co-stars Gary Lockwood as Lassiter, and the beautiful Nancy Kwan as Lee Su...",1440374400,,1074,5.463855421686747

2069665,5,B00029J2U8,"This was the sixth DVD documentary on Islam that I have purchased for my collection. Although all of these documentaries do present significant amounts of important, useful, correct, verifiable information, only one is completely without flaw with regard to the information presented. That one is ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" which is more about defining Islam and it's supremacist ideology.  ""The Project"" is more about describing exactly what the Muslims are doing in our country to take it over and how they are using stealth jihad, or cultural jihad as it is sometimes called, so successfully. Presented with my critique and explanations, I see ""The Project"" as a powerful tool to get people to wake up, become informed, and take meaningful action to defend our country against this most dangerous and insidious enemy.
The Project is a five phase plan for taking over America from within that the Muslims formed shortly after the Iranian revolution in 1982. They began working on this plan in 1985. Although The Project is a 20 year plan, the Muslims don't care if it takes 20 years or 200; they are as patient as they are determined, well organized, and well funded.",1382313600,2,1179,4.924623115577889

2069669,4,B00029J2U8,"I would have given this a higher rating if the quality of the video was better than a Dragnet-era liquor store surveillance system would have been. The fact that the action ends up in the Philippines is interesting, but the audio and video make it almost unwatchable. It was interesting also to see Gary Lockwood in something other than ""2001, a Space Odyssey"".

The plot is a precursor to the Jason Bourne concept, that the US specially trains multi-purpose assassins who must maintain a drug intake regimen to maintain their ""edge"".

The main revelation is that our current Attorney Genral still refuses to give the evidence that was provided to terrorist attorneys in the discovery process of the Muslim Holyland Foundation to ANY members of congress. Thats right they gave evidnce to convicted terrorist attorneys and Holder and Obama refuse to give it to any memebers of congress, they have denied freedom of information request as well as request from numurous members of congress.

The movie is presented in the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and has an interactive menu with chapters although the lack of subtitles was a concern.  It also ran to the orignal 90 minute run time.  My main concern was the very poor transfer even if the original was filmed on video cassette. The contrast on many scenes was horrible and post production artifacts were present throughout the entire movie. I have my doubts as to whether this movie should be diplaying ""Digitally Remastered"" on the cover as there is very little (if any) evidence of a proper clean up.

The ""Project"" is based on conjectures about infiltration on who's running our country. It doesn't prove anything nor does it dis-prove anything. The project was a series of disjointed issues regarding a religous sect employed in placed in the United States government; ideas are strung together in hopes of getting the viewer to believe disingenuous dialogue and subjects taken out of context.  If you're astute enough to follow the United States' activities involving war on foreign soil and why we are there, you won't believe what this DVD is trying to tell you. We're at war with a religion and religious fanatics who will stop at nothing to destroy the United States, what' new?  Our own laws prevent us from discriminating.

2069690,2,B00029J2U8,"There are better documentaries that explore the Islamist deception of the Muslim Brotherhood.  However, this documentary does have some value, especially for one who may be new to the Counter Jihad.

>>>I purchased this DVD specifically to learn more about the Islamist manifesto known as The Project; a Muslim Brotherhood document discovered by Swiss law enforcement authorities shortly after September 11, 2001.  That manifesto lays out a plan for Islamist infiltration of non-Islamic societies/governments with the ultimate goal of instilling Islamic Sharia law over the entire world.  This documentary does use The Project as a framework to structure the discussion.  However, this DVD is not truly about The Project, thus the title is misleading to Counter Jihadists.  I learned nothing new about The Project from this DVD.

Let me be absolutely clear; if you are newly interested in the Counter Jihad and just now starting to learn about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of America, this DVD will be of use to you.  You will most certainly be exposed to issues that you will want to explore further.  Indeed, I found some threads that will further my own research although not nearly enough threads to justify the time I spent watching this.

This DVD is much longer than it needs to be and could have better focused on what we finally learn is the ultimate goal of this production; the unsealing by the Federal Government of those documents disclosed to the criminal defendants in the Holy Land Foundation terrorist funding prosecution.  I know, I know. ""Huh? Why is he suddenly talking about the Holy Land Foundation and what the heck is the Holy Land Foundation?""

Chillingly, it shows  how the extremists are labeling people who use such words as  Islamic Extremists, Radicals, or  Terrorists as  Islamaphobic.  By changing the words Americans use to describe Jihadists, they can become the nicer,  gentler terrorists in peoples' minds--and thus, no longer a threat to be feared--even  though that group may be  plotting our demise tomorrow.  I  saw a man discussing  the Muslim Brotherhood last night and saw how  he repeatedly tried to shame the interviewer into using other words to  describe the radical elements in kindler, gentler terms--and I realized that the section on word choices in this documentary were absolutely spot on and not just filler.  It  also shows how Obama has been  closely associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and a member can be seen attending his first inauguration.

Men assemble in a dimly-lit room to watch a movie. A man starts shooting, warning horns sound an alarm. The movie ends. It is a training film for recruits. Vitamins and injections will improve their physical endurance so they can prevent assassinations of important people. Trevor objects to a changed policy. Will he be deprogrammed? Will he go public and blow the whistle? Lassiter calls medical. Trevor drives away to an out-of-the way place to see Carl Wagner. Some gangster wants to capture Trevor alive for his knowledge; some will pay well for it. Trevor plans to leave the country, he wants a boat. There is a wanted notice out for Trevor! Lassiter arrives to search for Trevor. The Philippine Security Agency is interested. A car with men attack Lassiter, but he arrives at a hotel. So does another man. Two men talk to Lassiter. Will they regret it?

Lassiter gets his injections. A phone call gives him orders. Trevor stays at a lodge elsewhere. Is he alright? A gang attacks Carl at his home. ""Where is Trevor?"" The police go to Wagner's home and find the bodies. Trevor can't call Wagner. The next day Trevor goes for a drive. He is seen and followed. Stunt doubles crash a car. Lassiter learns about Trevor's activities. ""What do I do?"" ""Bring him back or eliminate him!"" Lassiter boards a train, then recognizes a man. There is a small explosion. The story runs on. At night Trevor attacks his girlfriend (by mistake)! The effects of his training? A man who gives all his information has outlived his usefulness. One of the villains is caught and will be made to talk. They go to search for Trevor, who is on a dock by the port. The villains got there first. They want to make a deal with Trevor.

The villains want information about ""Project: Kill"". They hear the approaching helicopter, and things happen. Trevor overcomes his opponents and meets Lassiter. Will he step aside? No, there is a fight. Lassiter wins. Until they come for him? Lassiter gets his briefcase back. What will he do next?

2069806,3,B00029J2U8,"PROJECT: KILL (1976) has one overriding feature which makes it virtually impossible for a modern-day audience to take the film seriously.  And it's something that the filmmakers at the time would have had no control over.  Namely, the fact that the star of their movie is Leslie Nielsen as a ninja-like fighting machine.

Remember, this is Leslie Nielsen just before his roles in AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN series.  He was actually a serious actor at one point in the distant past.  But -- for me -- once I've seen him in those unforgettable comedies, I find it very difficult to go back and view his straight work without smirking and giggling.  During the fight sequences, I kept expecting cartoon sound effects or extra limbs coming out of nowhere to smack bad guys.

Still, while it's terribly unfair of me to criticize a movie for something that the filmmakers could not possibly have known about (unless they had a crystal ball in which to anticipate Leslie Nielsen's future career), it's something that virtually every member of the modern audience is going to bring to the table.  And it does help the movie during slower parts.  Every time you feel your attention flagging, just remind yourself that this is a drug-addled super secret agent played by Leslie Nielsen, and you can't help but at least crack a smile.

As the story begins, we're introduced to two agents, played by Leslie Nielsen and Gary Lockwood (the guy who got turned into a god in the second Star Trek pilot).  The title of the film refers to a secret US Government training program for its agents.  Trainees are pumped full of mind-altering, addictive drugs and forced to watch lots of ninja movies (sounds like an average Friday night for undergrads).  This causes the subjects to become super-human fighting machines.  They become coiled springs, ready to attack and kill at any moment.

They are so well trained, in fact, that they can easily lose control.  Maintaining the advantage over their newfound killer instincts requires the use of even more mind-affecting drugs.  Indeed, an innocent tap on Leslie Nielsen's shoulder nearly ends the life of his unfortunate love-interest.  And Gary Lockwood's training causes him to repeated punch his opponent forcefully in the groin.  I don't want to know what film entered that move into his physical lexicon.  (Oh, and in the beginning we learn that trainees are taught how to use anything as a weapon.  Even, the movie claims, toenail clippings.  I really with we'd seen this in action.  Seeing Leslie Nielsen attack some punk armed only with a toenail clipping could have propelled this movie into the AFI's list of top 100 all-time movies.)

Getting back to the plot, Nielsen's character (one of them men in charge of the project) has a crisis of faith, and flees the organization, forcing his underling (Lockwood) to spend the entire movie tracking him down.  I found the script a little unclear on what Nielsen is running towards.  There's a drug smuggling operation going on somewhere, but I was baffled as to how exactly Nielsen was related to it.  And I watched some sequences more than once so it wasn't as if my attention wandered.  The script just doesn't seem clear on a lot of points.

I did enjoy this movie for the parts which were genuinely good and for the parts which are delightfully cheesy.  This is not a great movie, but it is certainly entertaining.  It's a pretty standard action-adventure with the requisite number of fight sequences, criminal bad guys and unlikely romantic partnerships.

Nielsen's performance is fairly good.  His character is not only disillusioned with the training organization, but by fleeing he has removed himself from his source of control medication.  The portions of the film where he's fighting to keep himself mentally together are very effective.

My copy of this is the unbelievably inexpensive version released by Digiview Productions.  It's a very watchable edition, though I found the sound a little too soft in places.  This isn't a great transfer, but it isn't a great movie either, so any deficiencies in the DVD itself probably won't greatly affect one's enjoyment.  I mean, when a telephone conversation between Lockwood and his superior makes the unseen boss sound like his record is revolving at the wrong RPM, it really doesn't matter if there's a slight hiss in the background.

Go into this film with the realization that its Leslie Nielsen in a 1970s action-adventure movie with a goofy title, and you should glean some fun from it.  There are some gritty sequences where one discovers that the filmmakers were going for a much darker film than one would think.  Indeed, on the face of it, this is a very gritty sort of film.  It's simply let down by the fact that a lot the actual plot is confusing and poorly explained.  But ignore all that and just hope to be entertained.  Lower your expectations and try to have some fun.",1123977600,3,4925,4.853717026378897

8024318,3,B00029J2U8,"I'm willing to bet if you're reading this review you've probably already seen the film.....this isn't one of those films that people stumble upon, so spoilers ahead.

  The plot of the film is actually pretty decent for a no-name action film. It's almost a pre-concept movie for the ""Jason Bourne"" series of Films. Leslie Neilson Plays a Super Assasin/Commando/Ninja named Trevor (I think). He and his second in command, named Lassiter (Played by Gary Lockwood, of 2001 fame) Run a Top secret Government program that trains, for lack of a better term, Supermen, to protect valuable Government officials and instilations. These Men answer to no one, except ""The Program"", they are given daily injections of drugs that enhance their mental and physical states to that of a borderline superhuman, but they must constantly take these drugs to stay in control of their faculties, lest they become a danger to society. Trevor has become disillusioned with ""The Program"" as the people up top have started using his men as political assasins, and having them take on more offensively based missions, which is not what he signed up for. He want's out of the program, he wants to find a nice quiet place and live the normal life he never had. He voices his frustrations to Lassiter, who tells him what he is saying is dangerous and attempts to get a med team to get him treatment, as it seems Trevor hasn't been taking his drugs like he's supposed to. Trevor Knocks out Lassiter and escapes, and hitches a plane to the Philippines. He meets up with a couple of expat war buddies who loan him some money so he can lay low for awhile. Unfortunatley, A crime boss, (Mr. Lee) somehow finds out that Trevor is hiding out in his country and that he is an American agent with valuble top secret knowledge that many governments would pay quite handsomely to get their hands on. So Mr. Lee begins and his squad of low rent henchmen begin the search, Lassiter has also tracked him down, and has his own problems trying to maintain his cover story from being blown apart by the not stupid at all Filipino cop Mr. Ortiz (I think?). Trevor is basically trying to ditch The Mob, His former best friend and fellow killing machine, and the Filipino police force. all the while battling the constant threat of insanity that stopping his mandatory control injections leads to. It all comes to a boil in a final show down that will change the fate of.....a few Filipino dock workers.

Overall it wasn't a terrible movie, all the plot points and reasons for charicters doing things are iin the film, but it does demand your attention to catch snippets of dialog that explain things and ""build the world"" if you will. Pic and Sound of the disc itself is bleh, but watchable. (and hearable). It says digitally remastered on the case. I think they really mean ""It's on a Disc and not a tape therefore it's digital."" Overall, this movie seems like something that would have been on your local UHF station at 3am on a Weds. back in the mid 80's.",1467763200,,3010,4.652255639097745
