2230191,5,B0007P8KE6,"Okay, it's quite simple.  You.  Need.  This. Book.  Why?  Because the panasonic manual is not very thorough, and this book will answer everyone of those questions you want to ask.  Also, like all tools, it's HOW you use them that makes the difference.  I've seen great footage with the DVX, and really poor footage. The difference is in the user's understanding how to use the camera.  And this book will give you that understanding.

It has great info on how to achieve the best possible slow motion, how to deal with strobing, what the differences are between the different scene files, the advantages and disadvantages of shooting 24P normal and 24P Advanced, what the differences are between thin and thick, and a heck of a lot more.

The DVD is great too, because it has visual examples of slow motion, strobing, and changing individual camera settings.  This would be a real pain to do yourself.

You will not regret spending the money on this.  You've spent 3 grand on the camera and you really should invest the money on the REAL manual.

Good stuff.  Thanks Barry.",1107475200,10,1073,4.693548387096774
2230192,5,B0007P8KE6,"Barry Green's book/DVD combo is exactly what I was looking for in a practical guide to using the DVX100a.  The DVX DVD's thorough presentation on Scene File Settings is worth the purchase price alone, but is also filled with information laid out so clearly that even the novice will gain insight that would take countless hours of shooting and head wear to figure out.  The DVD Book is an invaluable resource that is incredibly easy to understand from a technical standpoint.  Read it from cover to cover or pick a point of interest;whatever you would want to know about this camera is explained concisely.  Cannot recommend it highly enough!",1107388800,3,642,4.862385321100917
2230193,5,B0007P8KE6,"If you own the DVX100, you simple NEED to own this book/DVD. I had the camera for several months before getting this guide and now I look at all the time I wasted, not really knowing how to use the full potential this camera offers. Barry Green takes all the guessing out of the equation and tells/shows you what the settings on the camera can do for you.

2230194,5,B0007P8KE6,"What an amazing resource! This book has to be one of the most useful tools I have ever purchased. The book and DVD have become as valuable as my camera [Maybe more!] Within hours I was producing images from the DVX I had no idea were even possible. I could have spent months trying to learn all the functions on this wonderful camera but Mr. Green shot me in the right direction right out of the gate. Unlike most educational material I have come across, this book is actually fun to read! Barry's style and approach to writing is both informative and interesting. And he teaches in a manor that anyone can understand. I sincerely wish ALL training guides were written in this manor. Also the DVD included is not your standard fluff ""marketing bonus"". It is produced to go hand and hand with the written guide. It's just fantastic to see what you are reading about! If you have the DVX this guide is as important for shooting great footage as any tool in your arsenal. Could not have been more pleased.",1107388800,2,1002,4.48087431693989
2230195,5,B0007P8KE6,"Even thought I am relatively new to filmmaking, this book was able to help me get the most from my DVX.  It gives more information, explained in a clear and easy-to-read manner than any other book I have read on any piece of equipment.

Not only does Mr. Green go through the myriad of technical setting, explaining what they do, and when to use them, but along with the DVD, he shows exactly what results you can get.

The DVX is one of the only video cameras available to the indie filmmaker that has 24P, hence a film-like look.  The DVD shows this with it's side by side comparisons.  It also shows you how to get different ""looks"" from the camera, outlining each specific setting.

This kind of knowledge is worth far more than the price of this book.  If you use a DVX and you are serious about getting the most from your camera, you cannot do without it.",1107388800,,861,4.34375
2230196,5,B0007P8KE6,"I'm an independent filmmaker with a fascination for the uniqueness of the 24P look. The Panasonic DVX100 (and DVX100A) camera has a special, almost analog look to its footage that is the closest thing I've seen to film since the beginning of my quest many years ago. Unfortunately, up until now, the only real literature for this camera came in the form of an incomplete instruction manual and a casual mention in other publications.

Barry Green loves this camera, and it shows in his latest DVD/Book. He is also a people person and it's evident in his writing style and the care in which he created the accompanying DVD.

Written for the everyman (and everywoman), this book communicates in a casual tone but behind every word is a depth of information that I have not seen in this genre. Green gets away from the technical style without ever leaving the technical meaning and somehow, you just get it. Everyone has that moment in their lives when they penetrate a difficult concept and it's a revelation.

Reading Green's book will give you that feeling many times over but you may not be able to finish it in one sitting. You will have an uncontrollable urge to start shooting with your new-found knowledge.

The accompanying DVD is equal in its caliber. Professionally hosted, concise in its message, it also has many useful tips that are genuinely practical to implement in the real world.

I cannot recommend this book/DVD combo enough, it easily dispels the mystery of the DVX and 24P.

... the best buy around.",1107388800,2,1519,4.756653992395437

As an independent filmmaker and avid DVX user (no pun intended) I found this book to be an invaluable resource. It has everything you would ever need to know about (arguably) the best prosumer camera on the market today. Barry Green has compiled all of the detailed information about the camera, and organized it into easy to understand chapters.

The DVD accompanying this book gives great examples of the more visually stimulating sections of the book. It makes the learning curve much smoother for the beginner.

Indeed the DVD is a long infommercial.

However the book helps a lot if you are a new DVX users. You can chose to use 10% of your camera or you can push it to the limit. This book will help you to fully use your camera and has simple wordings.

I recommand it,

8050154,4,B0007P8KE6,"The DVX book is absolutely easy to read and packed with useful information. Mr. Green and his co-writers have done one fine job here, as far as that goes.

Re: DVD? Could have been way better--for the price that they are asking. You don't even get a good shot of the camera to see what the damn thing looks like, etc. Is that asking too much? They could have shot some footage at night, could have shot more footage with the anamorphic adapter, could have shot footage in letterbox and/or squeeze mode. What they provide really isn't enough.

I could go on.

I'm on the fence as far as deciding between the DVX 100B or the Sony Z1 -- and that's why I bought this book .

The following isn't Barry Green's fault, no doubt, but Panasonic truly screwed up in my opinion by not making this camera 16:9 native.

As far as using (additonal eight hundred bucks) the anamorphic lens on this camera...forget it; the focus issues appear to be a major headache. No low-budget indie filmmaker (like myself) is going to have the kind of time it would require to futz around with it on location (while the clock is ticking).

As I understand it, had they made the camera 16:9 native they would have had to ask more than 4 Gs for it. Well, so what? I would have paid it. It would have been worth it, believe me--and I'm not swimming in money, either.

So if not the DVX 100B, what's left? As I mentioned earlier, perhaps the Sony Z1 -- and it's a real shame, because the 100B appears indie filmmaker friendly in every other way.",1146960000,6,1513,4.362989323843417

The book walks an owner through the various settings of the camera and what they do as well as extensive explanations about some of the more complicated issues like 24 frames progressive etc.

The DVD really gives a new owner of the camera a real world idea of just how great a picture can be achieved with this camera. You'd think you were watching a DVD made with a broadcast quality camera and in fact you'd be right because the DVD was made with the DVX camera.

The DVD shows real world examples of what the various setttings do and how they affect the picture. This is very helpful in for a new owner who has been using a consumer grade camera and has never had to deal with the complexity of a camera that has as many options as the DVX cameras.

8050158,1,B0007P8KE6,"I too was super excited to get this dvd to help me better understand the numerous and intricate settings that one should master in order to use the AG-DVX100. This camera has so much potential and I was hoping to find a reference that really made everything super clear and gave useful advice on what settings to use when encountering x situation. Ordered this overpriced dvd/book combo from Amazon, and to the seller's credit, it arrived a few days later.

I popped in the dvd with anticipation...shortly over 45 minutes later, I wanted my money back.

The dvd you're spending a bundle of money for was nothing more than a promo reel that basically highlights the fact that A)dv is not film, but if you try, you might get it to look the same, and B) if you buy some of these expensive accessories (16:9 adapter and mini35) you may have a chance. When you start the dvd you're prompted with a title menu with thumbnails of each of the mini video demos provided on the movie. Right away I was underwhelmed by the small number of demo clips. There are only 9 clips. Plus some very poor promo for a Fightscene DVD that they're marketing. Here is a breakdown of each clip:

1)Shallow DOF - no brainer stuff. shoot wide, back up, telephoto

2)DVX with Mini35 - ""Spend $10K for one of these to get even shallower DOF"". Seriously, thats all they say.

3) Widescreen Options - Buy the $800 lens, or shoot squeeze for 100A users, or letterbox for 100 users.

4) DVX vs Film - Yes, the DVX is similar to 16mm, if you try hard. But how do you do it? Well, they don't really go into that.

5) DVX vs HD1 - ""See, DVX is almost as cool as HD, but less edge sharpening."" end clip

6) 24P Strobbing- One of the more useful of all the clips. ""Pan slow, or use 30i or 60i"" Strobbing is a part of film, so get used to it basically.

7) Magical Projectile- Kinda cool but not really. They use in camera settings to get get similar (sometimes not even close) effects as Magic Bullet software. -Only one setting in there was even remotely non cheese.

8)Scene File Setting - The only realy useful bit in the entire dvd. They actually show you what every setting does at their most extreme settings. Then, you figure out which is best for you because ultimately, they can't tell you what you should set your camera at.

9) Frame Rates and Slow Motion. - Maybe useful? basically tells you to shoot at 30i and play back at 80% or 60i at 1/120 etc.

Keep in mind there are only 9 clips. 9! And only 3 had any kind of technical data to help you acheive that film look we all want.

Add in a really bad electric guitar for a score, and you have one really dissapointing dvd. My butt is still sore from all the kicking myself i've done.

Ending on a more positive note, the book, however, is useful. It covers everything in the dvd, and then some. Really all you need. While the dvd should have been a great visual guide to make the most of your AG-DVX100, it was nothing but fluff. The book actually gives you a nice field guide that you can take with you anywhere, complete with out electric guitar riffs.

Bottom line, if you like spending $70+ for a small paperback book that is basically a user manual on steroids, then get this, but certainly don't get it for the ""awesome"" dvd that comes with it.",1138579200,27,3274,4.31810766721044

Book Review by Alexa Lee

You are the lucky owner of a DVX100 or 100a. Before you go out and spend hundreds of dollars on software plugins, lens adapters, and the endless list of accessories, read up and get to know your little bundle of joy. I only wish I had ""The DVX Book"" by Barry Green a lot sooner, which was why I felt compelled to share my thoughts in a book/dvd review.

""The DVX Book"" has undoubtedly been one of my best purchase decisions as a videographer. It has put me in control of this revolutionary camera and implanted new found confidence in my work overall. For anyone serious about ramping up their skills and technical knowledge, this is a must buy, read, re-read, watch, and re-watch, production tool. There is no reason to be in the dark about what your DVX can do for you.

I am the owner of the first generation DVX. For over a year, I struggled with Panasonic's instruction manual. I simply needed more explanation and was overwhelmed by much of the terminology in the manual. Consequently, many popular features to this camera remained untouched or unused by me for a long time. I was hesitant to shoot in the progressive modes during critical shooting situations, particularly live wedding events. Until I knew I could take the results all the way to DVD without a hitch, I was not going to risk it.

""The DVX Book"" has helped me move forward. Mr. Green has the rare talent of being able to translate technical material into language that is crystal clear and relevant. He provides excellent examples and background information, vital to those trying to broaden their technical knowledge and go beyond the basics of the manual. This is truly a great way to grow as a videographer. The 155 page book is easy to reference and easy to take out with you on a shoot. Since I purchased this book, I have dedicated practice shoots to experimenting  with the camera, alongside the book. Its compact size and well-organized content has made ""The DVX Book"" the reading material of choice for when I am expecting some extra time on a plane ride, waiting at the post office, or during a lengthy computer render. As I learn more and more about how to take advantage of the camera, I have been increasingly able to achieve more organic, ""in-camera"" looks and techniques. Several of them I had previously thought could only be obtained in post production editing. Not so. This has saved me hours of edit time, leaving me more time to shoot! In addition to the segments dedicated to the DVX features, menus, and settings, Mr. Green has also included a very useful guide to using an anamorphic adapter with the camera. This is a much needed section that you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  While readers can expect a thorough guide to the camera, the issues of editing the DVX footage in different software programs is not covered.

The companion DVD has high production values and is easy to follow. Not only have I watched the DVD many times, but I also use it as a training tool for others. Newbies to the DVX have all instantly understood the key points and shooting guidelines presented. Among several engaging topics, Mr. Green shows you the advantages and disadvantages to shooting in the progressive modes and how to improve your results. The examples, as always, are thoughtful and complete with appropriate visuals. The pacing of the DVD material is perfect and each segment is well-timed to keep your attention. Mr. Green offers tips on obtaining shallow depth of field, shooting with the camera's different frame rates, and effectively using the scene file settings. Many of these topics would be missed or not fully understood by many videographers trying to learn how to use the camera on their own. An added plus, information is frequently spelled out in graphics, allowing the viewer to ""pause"" the DVD for taking notes. Primarily a self-taught videographer, I have found this especially useful. Another notable feature, Mr. Green offers some rare examples such as a DVX vs. film comparison, a DVX vs. JVC-HD1 comparison, and a segment dedicated to showing the DVX with the mini35 adapter. If you aren't already wondering about how the camera compares with the other production tools mentioned, within hours of using your DVX, you will. ""The DVX Book"" provides proof.

If you truly desire to make the most of your camera investment, this book/dvd has a place in your library. Better yet, clear some space, as this author has more educational materials due to be released in the coming months. Of note, a much anticipated book & DVD dedicated to lighting in video production is in the works. ""The DVX Book"" is Mr. Green's first publication, though he is well regarded throughout the industry as an emmy award wining producer. His work in writing and television production has earned him 4 emmy nominations. The book initially gained a loyal following from members of dvxuser.com, the best online source for information dedicated to this camera and future camera generations. Other authors of the book include Panasonic's own Jan Crittenden Livingston and Harry W. Foulds.
