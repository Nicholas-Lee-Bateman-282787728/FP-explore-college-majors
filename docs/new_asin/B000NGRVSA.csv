But for those who can't speak German or Russian, it's a rare opportunity to watch Bron in English (dubbed in English).  most of the youtube videos on youtube are in German or Rusaain.  Beides 27 dollars is a small amount to pay considering what one could get from the video series of this world class pedagogue.  It even comes with a ""libretto"", a mini score, clearly printed for e to follow the 1st movement of this concerto. The only downside is that it would have been nice if they featured the entire concerto, like whzt they did with Bach's BWV 1041. This is a very short student concerto.  It's like taking lessons with Zakhar Bron himself.  I wish there were more instructional videos like this out there.  This video is beneficial for both students and teachers alike.  We don't believe in the Suzuki method, except that it's ok for young children but not good enough for those who want to take their violin studies seriously.  Some of my former classmates in the conservatory have never ever heard of Suzuki method. They thought I was joking or talking about vehicles.  Many of you may not agree but for me there is nothing like the traditional method.  If Bron's former pupils are among the world's most sought after soloists, I suppose he must be doing something right.",1363132800,,1357,4.659663865546219
