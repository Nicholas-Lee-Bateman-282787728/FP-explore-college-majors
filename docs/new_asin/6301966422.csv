391627,3,6301966422,"Robert Altman movies are an acquired taste, and for the most part I haven't cared for them. I do like Brewster however. It's a hard to follow satire but I enjoy it. The movie would get 4 stars from me except for the fact it introduced Shelley Duvall. A very untalented actress IMHO.",1432512000,,282,4.339622641509434

391629,4,6301966422,"The most interesting films feature striking visual images and engaging chemistry among the actors. Plot takes third place  - so not to worry. Figuratively, Altman is riding a dirt bike on a bumpy path - saying, ""Look Ma, No Hands."". But what an eye!  Especially when it captures all the uniqueness of Shelley Duvall.  Nevertheless, Altman's more structured films like McCabe, Long Goodbye and Three Women will jump into my memories more often.",1424563200,,443,5.041095890410959

391699,5,6301966422,"Certainly Robert Altman's most under-appreciated film. I think that, after M*A*S*H* people were expecting a much more conventional follow-up and didn't understand this film's wildly inventive structure.  Although some of the satire no longer feels as fresh as it did at the time (we have become much more aware and cynical and less innocent as a society in the intervening  40+ years) the allegory still packs a punch of (surprisingly) deep religious and philosophical resonance.",1419984000,,479,5.373333333333333

391704,5,6301966422,"I just finished watching this movie which I haven't seen since it first came out 44 years ago. I was curious to see if it had the same effect on me and to some extent it did. A strange wonderful piece  of counterculture film making. I felt the  movie was a tongue in cheek stab at the establishment from the movies onset. I was in the service and Viet Nam was a constant reminder every day of how my generation was trapped fighting a war most of us didn't want or agree with. Along comes Altman with this wonderful irreverent poke at the establishment. The cultural avatars were perfect. The Steve McQueen super cop modeled on Bullitt and so on.

 Some reviewers seem disturbed by the fact that Brewster is a serial killer without embracing the concept that the movie is more about  what it's events are meant to represent than their actual substance. This movie is all about a young mans quest for freedom which Brewster hopes to achieve by flying away on home made wings. The movie has many unanswered questions. Who or what is Sally Kellermans character ? A Fallen Angel ? How did Brewster meet her ?  Is Brewster really a serial killer ? We never see Brewster actually kill anyone in the film and Kellerman is always present so doe she actually commit the crimes ?  The final murder after Kellerman leaves Brewster would seem to implicate him but it is not a hard fact.

This is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief to watch and enjoy it. It allows the audience to feel ""Wow it would be cool  to be able to flaunt authority like that !"" At the time I really enjoyed the car chase because I knew Brewster and his ditzy girl friend would emerge victorious. For fans of this type of movie I also recommend Malcom McDowell in ""IF"" and ""O' Lucky Man.""

At the time I first saw this film a lot of us would have liked to be able to put on wings and just fly away.",1408665600,2,1874,4.328571428571428
391705,4,6301966422,"Fun to watch again. Like so many movies from my youth, it doesn't have the same impact as it did then. They were doing so many new and unique things then that had never been seen or done. Things you would think 'can they say that?' Pushing the humor envelope some, like MASH and others. Still, a fun movie to watch, again.",1407369600,,322,4.209677419354839

This remastered edition looks good but strangely does not have captioning - perhaps not that strange because Altman's layered dialog is a nightmare to caption but much is missed by the absence of captioning.

This has been on my list of top ten films since I first saw it 40+ years ago.  It withholds at lot from the initial viewing and you discover something new each time you watch it.

""The film has references to other films, Altman's own work, and other places. Altman refers to Bullitt (1969) by including a character named Frank Shaft, who is a detective from San Francisco.""  The name may have inspired the name of Richard Roundtree's ""John Shaft"" character,  in a more subtle parody from 1971 (""he just took my man Leroy and threw him out the God damn window"").

""Homages to The Wizard of Oz (1939) have been noted in the film, as Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West, is the music conductor seen during the opening credits. She is seen wearing ruby slippers in the film.  Hope (Jennifer Salt) who supplies Brewster with health food, resembles Dorothy, as she wears a distinctive gingham dress, has pigtails and carries a basket. At the end of the film, she is shown in the cast as Dorothy carrying Toto.""

Shelley Duvall plays a Raggedy Ann airhead character (without Luna Lovegood's redeeming qualities) and actually appears as a Raggedy Ann clown in the final scene.

""Brewster McCloud"" is a film that presents society as circus performers and life as a circus,  if you haven't figured that out by the end Altman hits you over the head with it as he goes out with perhaps the best black comedy ending of all time.  Throughout the story a bird-like narrator, sometimes on camera and sometimes in a voiceover commentary,  discusses the traits of various birds;  traits that are shared by the human characters in the story, although that leap is left to each viewer.  Allusions to birds are found throughout the story,  from the orange Plymouth Roadrunner to the names of several assisted living facilities.

The title character (played by Bud Cort) is much the same naive Private Boone character Cort portrayed for Altman in ""MASH"".  The difference is that Brewster is on an ambitious quest to literally fly.  Which involves intensive physical training when he is not busy designing and building a set of Wright Brothers inspired wings.

During the course of his project Brewster has to be rescued several times and stay focused on his goal of flying. In this he is assisted by
personifications of Faith (Sally Kellerman) and Hope (Jennifer Salt).  Kellerman's character is actually named Louise and functions as his
guardian angel, although if Hope is Oz's Dorothy then Louise is Oz's Glinda.

""Hope"" is conceptually what self-pleasuring is all about and she demonstrates this when thinking about Brewster.  Freud's dream of flying as symbolic of the sexual urge is explained to Brewster by Louise and at first glance Brewster's loss of virginity and its attendant loss of idealism is what dooms him.  But I see it being more the loss of his humility.  And it is his new found arrogance that drives away his Faith.  She exits by the Astrodome's huge commercial gate which slowly closes after her exit,  trapping Brewster inside the structure.  He can utilize his wings in what is essentially a large bird cage but he cannot escape.  The dome representing the constraints and limitations of society and outside the dome representing freedom.  One assumes that had he not driven her away that Louise would have assisted him in leaving the dome.  There is a bit of ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" in this idea of needing to become infinitesimal in order to merge with the infinite.

Given that most of the cast were Altman regulars,  it is remarkable how successful he was with his physical casting.  Duvall, for example,  has not just the physical rag doll look (note the Raggedy Ann wallpaper in her apartment and the emphasis given to her huge eyes)  but her most striking feature is her thinness - a physical manifestation of her character's most striking feature - shallowness.

It is a nicely layered film that works well simply as a social satire of American values and conventions.  Many of these details will escape the notice of the first time viewer,  such as in the scene of Patrolman Johnson's family at dinner.  He has three sets of twin sons gathered around the dinner table in their Little League uniforms,  the smallest two playing for a team named ""WASPS"".

In the end the circus audience watches in satisfied fascination as yet another high flyer overreaches and falls back to earth.  The ""Greatest Show On Earth"" presided over by controlling ringmaster Haskell Weeks (William Windom),  perhaps a nod to cinematographer Haskell Wexler with whom Altman hoped to one day collaborate.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1390608000,11,4903,4.853012048192771
391751,5,6301966422,"First seen when it came out thirty years ago, this movie still bemuses with its portrayal of a strange young man's attempt to build himself wings, an allegory of a spiritual quest.  Quirky is the word that occurs to me.  And moving, if you have that prelediction.",1390435200,,263,4.574468085106383
391752,4,6301966422,"I first saw Brewster McLoud 30 40 years ago on late night TV. The 1970 movie's name in the program led me to casually assume it was a John Wayne Western, or similar. I was happily surprised when it turned out to be Robert Altman's next movie after M.A.S.H. So an eccentric premise and a lot of surprises. Not everyone's cup of tea-like substances, but if you like your brain to keep working during a movie, as well as your funny bone, this could be for you.
Shelley Duval's first movie; Stacy Keach's first movie as an avaricious landlord in a wheelchair; one of Bud Cort's portrayals of a youth in a parallel universe; Michael Murphy's colour-coordinated, doomed detective; Sally Kellerman's erstwhile avian alter persona of Hotlips; Ren Murat Auberjonois's demented ornithologist, not unlike an expanded Lucille Ball sketch; familiar and welcome faces from M.A.S.H and some really deep exploration of the Houston Astrodome.
There's a lot going on (and coming to sudden ends) in this Doran William Cannon screenplay. And Altman's characteristically dense, multi-layered  soundtrack takes your hand and accompanies you throughout. What more could a jaded afficianado want?
Brewster McCloud is one reason to collect all Altman's movies.
Some are on a higher rung of his ladder than others, but most are on a higher rung than most other movies.",1390348800,,1342,5.045045045045045

If you're a fan of the late sixtys & seventies, and, would like some great humor, and, a good look at the ups and downs of humanity in our society, a sprinkling  of the love we believed in, during a very tumultuous  period for America, and, the world, you might enjoy checking this one out.  It was well worth the wait.",1386288000,,642,4.4655172413793105
391755,5,6301966422,"This film made me an ardent fan of Robert Altman. I have fond memories of seeing it at midnight screenings aimed at the counterculture crowd. Technically the film transfer is flawless, looking far sharper than the image I saw in that seedy old theater, and the color rendition is vibrant and true. I'm not sure how this film will resonate with younger viewers; maybe you had to live through the Sixties to appreciate the subtext. But it's still a fun ride, and features a beautifully staged car chase between a Plymouth Road Runner, a Camaro Z-28, a souped-up AMC gremlin, and a dowdy old cop car, that you won't soon forget. The plot revolves around Brewster(Bud Cort), a naive, innocent young man who yearns to fly like a bird; and his mentor/guardian angel(Sally Kellerman), who appears to be an actual fallen angel (Spoiler alert: look for the scars). Fans of M*A*S*H will spot familiar faces. See It!",1381190400,,905,4.770700636942675
391756,3,6301966422,"This is one of the few Altman films I'd never seen. I knew it was surreal (which I love - 3 Women and Quintet are 2 of my favorite films) and I knew who was in it, but had never seen it.

I finally just decided to purchase the darn DVD. Well. This is obviously very early Altman. He did this right after M*A*S*H and he was obviously trying out new ideas and new ways to make movies. I love that. There are elements and storytelling ideas that he later perfected in Nashville and other films, but are don't quite work here. The story doesn't quite hold up and there are elements that are just confusing and outright illogical.

There is much that is genius, much that points to future genius and But Cort is completely wonderful. Anyone interested in film study should see it and anyone who knows and loves Altman's later work should see it just to see where he came from and where he took it later on.",1379894400,,901,4.2631578947368425
391757,3,6301966422,"I can honestly say I've never seen another film like this. Quirky, odd, yet ultimately entertaining. Surprisingly funny in an off-kilter way. A 1970 release, it has a bit of a dated feel, but Altman always manages to transcend eras and genres with his originality. Altman's social commentary and satire are about as strong as ever. Altman is one of the sharpest ever. Remastered Edition makes for a surprisingly good picture even for DVD. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but as an Altman fan, I'm very pleased to have this Remastered Edition in my permanent collection. So far, the only Altman film that I know of that has made it to BluRay is 3 Women. Surely this and the rest of his work will eventually get the high-def treatment.",1372464000,,737,4.633587786259542

391812,5,6301966422,"This quirky black (very black) comedy has always been one of my favorite movies. Also, one of my favorite Altman movies. Alas, I had to get a DVD copied from widescreen VHS many years ago since the studio never released it - until now! It is the best example of Altman's ""multiple simultaneous conversations"" style, using many members of his ""standard cast"" and filled with really funny ""Easter Eggs"". But, you have to pay attention. For example, watch for Margret Hamilton's (Wizard of Oz wicked witch) feet with red ruby slippers sticking out from under a huge birdcage that falls and kills her. This is also Shelly Duval's first movie, where Altman discovered her when they were filming on location in Texas. And you can in no way be prepared for the existential final credits as the cast parades around the Astrodome in circus garb.

I didn't want to go home! It set me off on a lifetime of film enjoyment. I've seen it countless times since. Although a little dated today, it always has something for me to re-find. Young filmmakers should see it for it's no-holds-barred attitude. It reveals how film can be used to reflect the times you live in.

A modern day fairy tale, Brewster McCloud is about a boy that is trying to become a bird and lives in the Houston Astrodome. It also follows the plot of a serial killer and the cop that hunts for him, played by Michael Murphy in a clear parody of Steve McQueen's Bullitt. Bud Cort gives a good performance as the title character, dressed up like Where's Waldo. Sally Kellerman stars as Brewster's guardian angel. Stacy Keach plays an eccentric businessman who is Brewster's first victim. And Shelley Duvall in her debut performance, plays a tour guide at the Astrodome and Brewster's love interest. rene Auborjonis narrates this wonderful film that was Altman's follow-up to M*A*S*H.

391816,4,6301966422,"On impulse I checked to see if this disc offered a commentary track by Robert Altman.  Altman's commentary on other discs was insightful and added enjoyment to the films in question.  Of course, Mr. Altman is deceased ergo lack of commentary.  Too bad because I'm sure Altman would have had some terrific things to say about ""Brewster McCloud"".  Be thankful that ""M*A*S*H*"" was a smash hit otherwise Altman never would have gotten this loopy exercise past the bean counters.  ""Brewster McCloud"" is a film that's best enjoyed by not describing it.  Plotwise it follows it's own askewed logic that you'll either love or hate.  I fall into the former category.  I don't give the film the full five-star star treatment only because at the film's midsection there's a long tedious car chase that doesn't pass the ""Bullit"" smell test that nearly scuttles the flick's equillibrium.  It's also fun seeing ""M*A*S*H"" alumnus in the film(Bud Cort, Sally Kellerman, Michael Murphy, John Schuck, G. Wood, Corey Fischer) as well as a nearly unrecognizable Stacy Keach and Shelley Duvall making an auspicious film debut.  The thing I most admired about Altman that a filmmaker that he was true to himself regardless of the commercial prospects of his work.  Today you can see his mantle passed on to a new generation of filmmakers notably Paul Anderson and Wes Anderson.  Wes Anderson probably payed homage to Altman by casting Bud Cort in ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"".

391901,5,6301966422,"This is a follow-up to Dr. Paddon's review from nine months ago.

The DVD version he bought in 2008 is a fraud.  ""Brewster McCloud"" never has been released on DVD.  What Dr. Paddon got was a disc containing a direct transfer from the VHS cassette version that the MGM studio released in 1993.  Somebody who has access to a machine that transfers VHS cassettes to DVD discs ripped off Dr. Paddon for 10 or 20 dollars.  This somebody used to operate a web site called [..].  Like Dr. Paddon, I, too, noticed the site in 2008 and bought this movie on DVD.  I noticed the absence of the MGM logo on the box or disc.  There is a fradulent logo that says ""DVD Video.""

It would be nice if the copyright holder of ""Brewster McCloud"" reads this.  Maybe it's somebody who works for MGM, which did in fact release the movie on VHS cassette in 1993.

The reason Dr. Paddon noticed a lack of detail in the actors' costumes and in the Houston scenery is that he was watching the VHS cassette version transferred to a disc.  ""Brewster McCloud"" has yet to be restored with detail from the 35 millimeter negative.  It has yet to be released on DVD.

The quality of the movie (minus the technical issue of whatever detail can be salvaged from the 35 millimeter negative -- such as Shelley Duvall's eyelashes ?) is awesome.  The screenplay, radical process of storytelling and performances are top notch.  Maybe all the detail from the 35 millimeter negative will reach a wide audience again.",1248393600,5,1474,4.526515151515151
391902,3,6301966422,"Memo to whomever owns the copyright for Robert Altman's movies:  You must do a restoration job and release the DVD all over again.  I realize that amazon.com does not list a Brewster McCloud DVD or sell it.  I am writing this for the benefit of people who have bought the DVD from the ""animefirst.com"" web site.  I did that, and I am missing the fine detail that I vividly recall seeing in previous viewings in the theater and on VHS cassette.

Every reviewer on this page is reviewing that videocassette version of Brewster McCloud.  I don't see any complaints about the fine detail.  So I am chiming in here to help animefirst customers who expect a DVD that is on a par with MASH, Nashville and other Robert Altman classics. Animefirst either does not display customer reviews, or it does not display them as prominently as Amazon.  So I may be the only person who can point out the poor detail to the Altman Estate.  Or is MGM the interested party?

Here are two examples.  There is a scene during the first 20 minutes in which Brewster, the title character, shoplifts a camera from a camera store while his accomplice Louise shoplifts many rolls of Kodak film.  When I watched the VHS cassette from Blockbuster Video in 1996, I could distinguish the Kodak boxes and filters on display in that store.  Now I can't.  I could see them during a screening at the American Film Institute.  Now I can't.  The next example is from the finale, and I am not spoiling it.  The audience inside the Houston Astrodome is applauding. (I won't explain why nor will I describe what has been / will be in front of them).  On the videocassette I could see the faces and bodies of the audience members, many of them heavyset mothers sitting next to children.  I also could see them at the American Film Institute.  Now I can't.

Please do a restoration job and redo the DVD.  You owe that to Mr. Altman's memory and to older citizens of Houston who would love to see buildings and roads that are gone now.  Local historians in Houston would love to see the Astroworld theme park with its boat ride that was demolished in 2005.  Oldtimers in Houston's local cultural scene (theater and talk radio) would love to see more detail in Mr. Dean Goss during the few seconds Mr. Altman put him on the screen.  Mr. Goss died at age 56.  I have never even lived in Houston, but I love the way this film is the first color film to capture the landscape of a city other than New York or Los Angeles.  The Empire State Building and the Sunset Strip are fun places to visit, and bravo to ""An Affair To Remember"" and ""The Graduate"" for capturing them, respectively, in color so long ago.  But did you know that civilization existed outside New York and Los Angeles in 1970?  I want my kids to see that it did.  Please, Mr. or Ms. Copyright Holder, do something about this!

I don't want my money back.  I want my son and daughter to get their chance for enlightenment back.  I am a professor of American history at two community colleges in the Raritan Valley region of New Jersey.  It would be wrong for my children to think that all the birds that were alive in 1970 lived in Central Park eating scraps from corned beef sandwiches and hot pretzels.  That's not the way it was.  Yes, we have color pictures from Sesame Street in 1969 and 1970, but they are all from New York.  When the Children's Television Workshop taught kids what water was, they showed fountains in New York but nowhere else.  Yes, we have Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" filmed in color on location in Bodega Bay, California in 1962, but many of those birds were fake, and the whole thing was a macabre fantasy.

Show me the rest of the United States.  Show me more of Margaret Hamilton's patriotic attire while she sings our national anthem.  (That's the second scene in Brewster McCloud for those of you who haven't seen it.)  Show me her stripes and the pattern.  Please don't tell me Holly Golightly was an outspoken Texan who liked the Star-Spangled Banner.  That would be fraudulent history.  As the poet Howard Nemerov said, ""The reason certain people don't learn from history is that they aren't the people who learned last time.""  Thanking you in advance.  Now my review has three stars.  Give my son and daughter more of the truth, in living color, and I will add two.  Kids won't sit through two hours of black and white, you know.",1224028800,4,4377,4.5006353240152475

After all, it was Altman, for whom straightforward movies like M*A*S*H are a rarity.  But, nada.

At least Thieves Like Us and Streamers are available as imports.

391908,4,6301966422,"Robert Altman made Brewster McCloud around the same time as his acclaimed MASH was released, but for some reason this has been forgotten over time. Revealing any of the story would be useless because the film is so utterly absurd it wouldn't make sense. The comedy ranges from bird poop on dead bodies to a supporting character who's a direct spoof of Steve McQueen's 'Bullitt.' Weird, silly, oddly sexual, and hilarious. Not for all tastes, but worth a look if you're up for something very, very different. A DVD release would be terrific, especially if Altman gave a commentary.

391947,3,6301966422,"BREWSTER MCCLOUD concerns a young man (Bud Cort; he was Harold, in HAROLD AND MAUDE) who lives in a room inside the Houston Astrodome, and dreams of flight.  He spends his time photographing birds and designing wings, in the hopes that he can take to the air as a bird does.
A second plotline involves a serial killer, a performer of strangulation murders, loose in Houston.  The HPD have called in Shaft, a hotshot San Francisco detective, to help solve the case.  Each of the victims is found with bird excrement on his face.
Of course, our naive and physically slight Brewster is the killer.
A film of bizarre plot and presumptively a satire, BREWSTER MCCLOUD does not approach the mastery of Robert Altman's other films of the period, particularly MASH and MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER.  Occasionally the dialogue is very funny, but too often the director chose to impress the viewer with a skewed sensibility which leaves much to be desired. Inconsistent shots and the lack of a consistent structure probably leaves many viewers reeling.
Similarities to other Altman films abound, but most easily spotted are the terrific ensemble cast, the familiar players from other Altman films, such as Rene Auberjonois, G. Wood, Kellerman, and Duvall, and the use of voice-over throughout the movie.  The police radio, in this case, takes the job of the intercom announcer in MASH, and provides a useful way of moving the plot along.
Not quite for Altman completists only, I'd recommend this to all Robert Altman fans, fans of Harold and Maude, and fans of bizarre movies.  In a sense this is a black comedy.  Not depressing in the least, it represents a rare, brave attempt to make a unique motion picture.  While it doesn't work on a number of levels, various strange elements stand out to make BREWSTER MCCLOUD a movie worth seeing.

Although the plot has it's holes, it is ultimately unimportant.  It's the characters themselves that make this film.  Both Duvall and Kellerman are captivating while the protagonist embodies that little part of us all that wants to just disappear from time to time.

391949,4,6301966422,"This is an oddly touching film despite its ostensibly disjointed plot, which is replete with a send-up of the coldest of the ""cool"" Steve McQueen personas (in ""Bullett""), plus a teasing parody of Altman's own ""M*A*S*H"" sequence in which Sally Kellerman is humiliated in the shower. (This time she is revealed bathing in a public fountain!) The film posits a definite yearning for innocence and escape from the gross cruelties and disappointments of the Vietnam War era through the young Brewster McCloud's attempt to fly as a bird -- of sorts. However, he can only do this if he maintains his own sexual innocence (a very traditional religious concept, by the way), and he doesn't, of course, and so is betrayed by a callow (and callous) ""Eve"" -- portrayed by one of Altman's favorite performers, Shelley Duvall, in her debut.
Sally Kellerman, by the way, is a really beautiful, touching ""bird-woman,"" who is Brewster's personal ""angel""; Bud Cort is a gentle but naive hero (despite being a mass murderer!), and the film only seems to run along without care for the plot, for it is actually a well-crafted story of a futile attempt to ""regain Paradise"" by ""flying away"" from our cruelly competitive and facile culture. It finishes very enigmatically, yet tragically, for it is also a symbolic account of the failure of the 1960s ""youth rebellion."" Not among the ""best"" of Altman -- ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" is the better depiction of American decay, and ""Nashville"" is Altman's quirky yet perceptive study of U. S. politics -- but I can't get it out of my head: it makes me sad and full of yearning myself....",1017360000,33,1609,4.833333333333333
