Recently I found an album on iTune, and I admit that I cannot stop listening to the funny conversations every single day.  They always make me laugh, and is just what I need after a long and crazy day at work.  I am so excited that I get to watch Art and these children on a DVD, after waiting all these years!!  This is absolutely something that no one should miss.  The innocence of childhood that we don't see  often anymore nowadays..",1275696000,10,551,4.093457943925234

8185681,5,B000ON1ADY,"The Art Linkletter CDs are great because the quality is superb.  The segments with the kids are as I remember them.  My brother was on the show for one of the segments when he was in the 6th grade, but unfortunately his school didn't appear on any of the CDs.  Maybe they will produce more segments of Linkletter's shows with the kids because they are innocent, funny, and enjoyable for the whole family.",1368057600,,404,4.506849315068493
