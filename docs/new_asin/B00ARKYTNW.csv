8556881,3,B00ARKYTNW,"This DVD contains contains two live TV shows from the '50's. The first is ALL-STAR REVIEW from 1951. The second is THE MILTON BERLE SHOW from 1956. Supposedly it's a special TV version of O & J's hilarious HELLZAPOPPIN' stage show. Not surprisingly it's mostly Berle trying too hard to be funny. (He doesn't quite make it.) O & J are kind of an afterthought. The team is showing their age. Both shows were done toward the end of their 35 years together. The Berle Show is supposedly a 'celebration' of their 35th anniversary as a comedy team 'that very day'. If what you're looking for is the 'real' HELLZAPOPPIN', it's best to pass this up and instead purchase the HELLZAPOPPIN' film version Olsen & Johnson made in 1941. They were a lot younger and still able to do the wild slapstick that made them famous. The one redeeming bit of the Berle Show comes at the very start. Berle is telling the audience that their type of humor isn't modern enough and not really funny anymore. Olsen & Johnson respond by giving Berle a pie in the puss and then a blast from the seltzer bottle. The audience eats it up.",1499644800,,1104,4.47029702970297
8556882,5,B00ARKYTNW,"This 118 minute DVD is a 1951 Episode of ""All Star Review"" and a 1956 episode of ""The Milton Berle Show"" which is a tribute episode to Olsen & Johnson's 35 years in show business. Both shows pull many prop and sight gags from their ever-evolving and changing Broadway shows, and are very, very funny, combining skit comedy, prop comedy, and very zany ricochet humor, you never know which way a skit is going to turn!",1368144000,7,416,4.4868421052631575
