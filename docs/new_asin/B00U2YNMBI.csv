8704172,1,B00U2YNMBI,"FIrst off, it's not a really a movie, as it's only 49 minutes long. Second, there's no english dialogue (there are, to be fair, subtitles), and clearly this was shot on video with the ambient light being the only lighting, as it's DARK DARK DARK. The coup de grace is that about half the actors can't act. And finally there's the ending. It just ends. Suddenly and unsatisfying.

Oh, and did I mention there's no exorcism? None.",1481932800,,428,4.558441558441558

8704177,1,B00U2YNMBI,"This is a short film of 49 minutes (box claims 70) with an added short feature that was 30 minutes plus a number of metal/ death metal music videos. The films had English subtitles with action that can put one to sleep. The zombies attack a church during a funeral, apparently saying the wrong words at the wrong time. In the middle of the film we have a guy whispering a rather long prayer which was incredibly boring.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Brief nudity in Music videos only.",1450828800,,478,4.431818181818182

8704180,3,B00U2YNMBI,Pretty cool movie. Zombies rise up and attack a church during a funeral. German with subs. The only thing that surprised me is that it's only 49 minutes. Guess it's my fault for not noticing when i bought it. Watchable for die hard zombie fans.,1432339200,,244,4.444444444444445
