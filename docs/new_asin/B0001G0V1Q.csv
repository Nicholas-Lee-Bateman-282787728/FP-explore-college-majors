8011963,1,B0001G0V1Q,"Very unprofessional DVD!!!! When I first saw the item, I thought there was a mistake, and I accidentally ordered a compilation CD, because the DVD is in a CD case. I was so disappointed, at the picture and sound quality!!!! It looked as if someone taped it from different sources (TV, Rhino Compilation VHS, etc.), and edited them, but in such a lousy way!!!! Many video's are cut in the end. The sequence is also horrible!!! Whenever you skip to go to another track you get half of the video from the previous track you skipped!!!! I am so certain I would have done such a better job taping the music video's from TV (i.e., VH1 Classics), editing them, and making them look more professional than this garbage!!!!",1098576000,10,714,4.5859375
