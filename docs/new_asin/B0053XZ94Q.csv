4552999,1,B0053XZ94Q,The movie was so bad I could not finish it,1425081600,,42,3.3
4553000,3,B0053XZ94Q,"Not up to the standards of any Carry On before England. England stunk! At least this one has its merits,for one in the person of Julian Carry,Supposed to evoke Ken Williams?I liked him best of all. Jim Dale was a good star. The script really let the gang down,and the cast was always reliable.",1418947200,,293,4.444444444444445
4553001,3,B0053XZ94Q,"The acting and sets are good in this last of the ""Carry On"" pictures but the script leaves a lot to be desired.  Some good moments but not up to par with the older ones.  Picture and sound are OK.",1380240000,,196,3.875

8455890,2,B0053XZ94Q,"Chock full of British '50s inuendo, which is long gone and should remain so. I watched it for the Rik Mayall scenes. Which we excellent. Unlike the rest.",1463184000,,153,4.5
8455891,1,B0053XZ94Q,I just felt that this particular Carry On vehicle was very poorly done. I remember watching others and finding them amusing. This one was simply so ridiculous that it was not even amusing. I watched longer than I should have hoping it was going to get better. It actually got worse.,1459209600,,282,4.549019607843137
