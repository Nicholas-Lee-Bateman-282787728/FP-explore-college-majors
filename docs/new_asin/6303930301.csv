7858674,5,6303930301,This video is sensational. The reason for this is the Asian lady who is on the right of screen. She has the most amazing body and  has the tightest and most revealing leotard on workout VHS. The cameras spent more time on her than they did with the instructor. A must do and see.,1311292800,,279,4.166666666666667
7858675,5,6303930301,"I used to use this video back in '98 and I lost a truck load of weight. It is a great workout, it kept me sweating and challenged. I used to yell at the screen ""ALRIGHT ALREADY"" The only thing that I did not like was when she made her turn , boy what a surprise, other than that it is a  great full body workout. I recommend this tape to people who are just starting out and really need to work it off.",1233705600,,402,3.7857142857142856
7858676,5,6303930301,"This video was added to my workout library several years ago. Now I'm replacing my worn-out original copy! I like it because no matter what level I'm at (if I'm working-out strong everyday or getting back from a hiatus), I can accomplish a heart-thumpin' workout in 30 mins. The instructor's peppiness gets me smiling & feeling energized. It's a quick way to burn calories, sweat, & feel good!",1194134400,,393,4.794117647058823
7858677,3,6303930301,"This 30 minute workout is led by Jennifer Mills.  She is joined by several female exercisers and one male.  The workout is all low impact broken down into 3 different routines not including warmup and cooldown.  Each segment is pretty short and includes fairly basic but somewhat dancy choreography which shouldn't be too hard to pick up but might take a few tries.  Some of the moves in this workout include grapevines, hamstring curls, knee lifts, chasses, marches, rock steps, cha chas, side taps, step squats, and lunges.  There are also arm movements and some pivot turns that are added to the moves.

I gave this one 3 stars as I wanted to like it but just didn't care for it much.  It is not a bad routine, but the background participants are so noisy with the whooping and yelling that it is just a bit much.  I haven't seen all of the Crunch workouts, but I would say this could be one of the worst as far as whooping factor goes.  So, if you are one that gets annoyed with that, stay clear from this one.  Jennifer is not a bad instructor but the moves could be demonstrated a little better, there is not much warning as you just get right into it.  Plus there are traditional lunges at the end that are not demonstrated at all and someone who is not familiar with correct form could really hurt their knees.

If you can get past the noise and have the patience to learn the moves, this is a decent short low impact aerobic routine.  Unfortunately it just didn't work for me.",1131321600,,1485,4.395604395604396
7858678,2,6303930301,"The instructor on this video is incredibly over-enthusiastic in a really annoying way.  She reminded me of the cheerleader on Saturday Night Live-- you know, the irritatingly enthusiastic Cheri O'Teri character ""Spartan Spirit""?  Her voice sounds the same, she does this ""Uh Oh-- now try this"" line over and over again.  I scanned it once to see how hard the moves would be, then tried to do it myself.  The moves were fairly okay, but the video itself really got on my nerves.  The group working out here also yells and whistles and acts like they are having the best time in the world, and the general feel of the tape just made me want to put in my old Cher tape and appreciate how less annoying it was.
Don't get this if you are someone who would find working out with the Spartan Cheerleaders annoying.",1027987200,3,807,4.5
7858679,3,6303930301,"This video, like all crunch videos is loud which I like and find encouraging and it will definately works up a sweat, gets your heart pumping & get (or keep) you in shape.  However, it I found it difficult to follow,  a little too much dancing for my taste.  Its a good workout, but not my favorite.",1010620800,2,299,4.2105263157894735
7858680,4,6303930301,"I am an advanced excerciser with lots and lots of tapes. When I do floor aerobics  and need  a fast not to hard work out I find myself reaching for this tape. I think it is alot of fun not to complex in choreography, like  other Crunch Aerobics "" Tracey York"".However, It is noisy like  all Crunch's stuff which I usually do not prefer.",955670400,3,336,4.203125
7858681,2,6303930301,"I bought this tape a while ago and have not used it much since. The workout is compact, but does not have much else going for it. I used to watch Crunch fitness on a regular basis, and loved it. I am very  dissapointed with this product. The moves actually start out difficult,  resulting in a lot of rewinding to get them right, and get easier as the  tape goes on. They also get more ridiculous as the tape progresses. I was  looking for a tape that would get my heart pumping but though my heart rate  did increase, I did not break a sweat while the instructor did. Her  favorite move, ""the swim"", combined with her hooting and  hollering did nothing for me. I would recommend other Crunch fitness  products to people but not this one.",934761600,5,738,4.335766423357664
