1819198,5,B00007L4N4,"i have been a huge cradle of filth fan since about 94,and when i learned that (dani filth) had a magor role in a horror film i became excited and hunted this movie down.
cradle of fear is a return to the campy styles of older 80's horror movies,and has enough plot twists and turns for any horror fan. this dvd is well worth the risk for any fan of b-movie horror films that may not have allready seen it.
this film is recomended to people who liked movies such as (rocktober blood,trick or treat,or prince of darkness)...",1044921600,3,522,4.336734693877551

i don't like horror movies but since cradle of filth is my favourite band, i decided to check it out! and it rocks!!!",1041206400,5,238,4.311111111111111
1819210,5,B00007L4N4,After you find out what's really going on. It's a really good crazy movie. Very crazy.,1507766400,,86,4.4375
1819211,1,B00007L4N4,This was a pretty bad movie. Just a bunch of gore that really didn't make a lot of sense. I just couldn't do it.,1507420800,,112,3.7083333333333335
1819212,5,B00007L4N4,"Rare B rated horror at it's finest. The story is just plain creepy (but here it's a compliment). I'm quite sure whoever wrote this story may have had more ideas floating with the story, which I would have been interested to read about. As it is, the movie still captures this deep sense of foreboding, like really really well. For a low budget, I have to say it curdled me more than a few times, so mission accomplished Mr. Chandon. The story is actually pretty complicated, it loops like 3-5 acts together to make a much larger story arc, which I thought was very unique and clever. None of the people are innocent in this movie, every person murdered was in essence a very misguided people, would really be putting it too mildly lol, one girl murders an old man for money, an amputee chops off a guy's leg so he can have his own (almost reminded me of an outer limits thing just with more horror), and probably one of the more disturbing scenes was the guy who worked an office job finds these well, how else could I say snuff websites and he becomes so addicted to them that it interferes with his job (was really the least of his problems), but then he gets fixated on them & attempts to try it but ends up beating a girl up (they merely suggested it, I don't recall the beating being shown, but I can't remember, but when someone went to check on her, she had severe wounds on her person).

 But, these are just kind of like the mini stories to the plot, the main focus is centered around oddly enough an old asylum inmate for the criminally insane (think of someone who would have ended up in bedlam if he were a real person). He was a hypnotist cannibal (certainly this story is not for the feint of heart), or people who don't like gross things. While, they don't actually show any cannibalism, except for one part that I did find was hard to watch even for me (and I'm quite used to horror/thriller types). But, it's a revenge story because this insane criminal wants revenge for the det. who put in away (I'm sure it wasn't just him, judges have to approve that stuff too), but for some reason Kempur wanted to blame the det. so he goes about making a list for people he thinks wronged him, or people he could target to get closer to the det. Though, how some of them connected was still a bit sketchy to me (it's the kind of film that if you don't watch it close enough you can miss little details, though it's not overly complicated).

And Cradle of Filth's lead singer Dani Filth plays a character only refered to as ""the man""...he's not even given an official character name, which ...I don't know kind of frustrated me a bit, but at the same time, that might have been a little ingenious on the writing part. We were lead to believe that ""the man"" was a bi-product of Kempur's early days being a hypnotist, that in essence he brainwashed several children (though I was still a little confused as to those details).It was a little hard to believe that in this day and age someone could be hypnotized to become a killer, was a little out in left field, but I sort of brushed it aside (now if this were Victorian England, the case would have been made more substantial, perhaps a more period piece would have lent far more credibility to the case, as hypnotists were far more common then and people put more weight behind that sort of non-sense).I mean, the few few scenes we see some punks trying to beat the man up in an ally, and then he unleashed some hulk-buster type ""smash-kill"" thing lol, it was like, what the hell am I seeing? Why would he purposely let people beat on him, and then kill them, the only answer I could draw there was adrenaline.

 If you're looking for Dani to talk at depth in this film, it is mostly a no-go. But that one golden line we hear he delivers with a velvet voice. I'm torn about whether he needed to talk more (oh and the rambling in his chair room doesn't count as talking LOL, that weird chant he was saying/mumbling of an utter mad-man LOL). Still, Dani just has a way with the camera, his movements are so cat-like, though whenever he's seen in a shot (I like that one scene where he's coming up on the officer, the thud of the boots was a really great effect, I thought to myself, he's in for it now). There are still a few loose ends that confused me about the overall story, like how did he know where all these people lived (I know Kempur knew their names, but how did he know where they lived?). And Kempur passed along this note with the names of these people on the list. I won't ruin the ending for those who haven't seen it, it's quite different than how you think it will go. This movie just had an amazing set up quality, it constantly sets the characters up to fail, and while normally those type of movies depress the hell back into me, I admit...in this movie it's a bit scary, a bit tongue-in-cheek, but oddly enough you don't really feel bad, because all the characters are rotten to the core, even the ""noble"" detective you find is capable of murder, so I think that's what Kempur was spouting about the whole ""you never believed in evil"", so I found that very revealing that pushed in the wrong way, anyone could be capable of such, but it's rather the choices you make, he had the choice to put down the gun (but while Kempur's revenge was mostly complete, it was odd that the detective's need for it even outweighed Kempur's --talk about a turn in the story). Even, the end of the movie sort of ends with a slight cliff-hanger, I mean it's mostly resolved, but it's clear Chandon was perhaps toying with a sequel. I really wish he would, because I loved this film, even though it wasn't the most budgeted, they made good use of what they had and I found it actually very realistic in some sense.

Chandon had some really great shots, I especially loved the hallway mirror shot, you can see this image of a beautiful gothic woman on a side poster (only a film nerd like me would probably notice it) and it was clever use of angles, with Dani being shown in the mirror hallway). Another of my favorite shots is when he's in the room with that gothic girl (found it highly amusing that she put pills in both of their drinks, and what it does nothing for/to him in the story (is he suppose to be immune to drugs, I suspect it may have been playing on a supernatural element there, even though the story makes you think he's just a normal man. It was clear in the club that the camera wanted you to be aware that he had a charisma that pulled people to him--so it does LOL)? I sort of laughed at that absurdity)..but that shot of his smoky bedroom eyes, good gracious...he has eyes that could scare the soul out of you. But I also loved the lighting and framing about that one shot, it was like almost the perfect shot if you ask me. I know Chandon did a few Cradle of Filth videos, but I wish he would come back for a few more (I'm not sure if he's directed anything since Her Ghost in the Fog & or Scorched Earth Erotica--not entirely sure he directed that one but since it was meshed with scenes of the movie I assumed he did that one).

This isn't a movie for everyone and it is pretty disturbing (my accent has just made an oxymoron LOL). However, anyone who something akin to vignettes put into a larger story, might find this approach interesting. Anyone who likes Cradle of Filth music, or Dani Filth, well you're probably here if you do, if not, I think you'd find his acting style rather strange and quirky but likeable (in a dark way LOL). And if you've just a strict horror buff, do if for the b-rated cheese, the topless women (if that's your thing), and the gore and violence that you know are in this film. But, aside from all the fluff, the story line is very complex at the core and that's what I like about it (the long-short version LOL).",1459728000,,7827,4.320408163265306

1819215,2,B00007L4N4,"Cradle of Fear is a film I rented once years ago when I was an extreme Cradle of Filth fan but couldn't get through it. I remembered it being cheesy, poorly made, and honestly rather boring. Watching it again I remember exactly why I felt this way. Many of the effects, while spectacularly gory (and well worth watching for any gorehound), are poor in their appearance and execution. For example the ""baby"" early on is pretty neat looking, but the way it actually moves and everything is simply laughable and entirely unbelievable. In addition to situations like that, the sound effects, not to mention the soundtrack as a whole, are pretty awful. It's like a never-ending reel of cheesy stock sound effects complete with everything ranging from UFO-like wailing noises to the most bland splatting/squishing noises you could think of. Some of the Cradle songs slipped in from time to time aren't awful but at the same time they make the film come across as little more than a blatant Cradle cash-in and advertising film. Dani, the band's vocalist, plays the leading role, slaughtering people endlessly, but the rest of the band can be seen in parts as extras. Ultimately, if you like extremely gory films, this one might be worth checking out, just be warned that the rest of the film's quality is incredibly sub-par.",1387843200,,1317,4.831858407079646

1819218,2,B00007L4N4,"When I heard that extreme metal god Dani Filth of Cradle of Filth starred in a movie, I hastily went looking for it. The four dollars it cost to rent this movie is about all it's worth. I am no movie critic, trust me. But this movie is nothing special. So Dani Filth plays ""The Man"" who i guess is summoned from hell buy this murdering psychopath to brutally murder his prosecutors. The main story line isn't all too bad, however there are around 5 different sub-plots that stray to far from the main plot, leaving the audience confused. I often had to ask myself ""who is this guy again? how does he fit in with the main story?"". The only thing this movie has going for it is the classic B horror movie gore, which is at some times very comical (i.e. when Dani Filth guts a cat and eats it's entrails...which now I realize had nothing to do with the story whatsoever.) Other than the blood and gore, the only other thing that really stood out to me was the tasteful nudity in more than a few scenes. All in all, i found this movie quite horrible. Unless you are a long time Cradle of Filth fan and want to see Dani try his hand at acting (if you can call it that) then I suggest staying far away from this film.",1361145600,,1211,4.17948717948718

1819221,3,B00007L4N4,"The first things people who watch this will notice is that this movie is shot on video(maybe due to not having alot of money to make it). It looks a little like a horror soap opera. Now on to the film itself. It stars Dani Filth(from the band cradle of filth) as a demon who goes around killing for his father who is in jail for multiple murders. The acting in this movie ranges from really bad to just average. The gore and effects are pretty well done with a few exceptions(watch the dolls get thrown from the car crash scene to see what i mean,among others). Plenty of blood,guts and nudity to go around. Not the best horror out there but you could do alot worse then this movie. It is a fun ride while it last just don't expect a masterpeice of horror cinima. I got the feeling if the director wouldve had more money to work with this movie would be an easy 5 star horror.

When they made it, they totally knew it wasn't Oscar-worthy or anything. I bought this because I'm a major Cradle of Filth fan, not because I expected some amazing quality film. And for all it's worth, I found Cradle of Fear well....enjoyable. It was twisted and sick, and went places with the gore that a big-screen movie normally wouldn't at times, but that's what made it so great. I think that it pretty much holds its own, and is just what you'd expect from a B-movie. If you like Cradle of Filth, or b-movies, this film is perfect for you.

1819225,1,B00007L4N4,"Cradle of Fear (Alex Chandon, 2001)

I go through phases, usually during the winter, where I watch an insane number of movies in a relatively short time period. Usually, when I call something the best or worst film I've seen that particular week, it's from a choice of five or six movies. This week, I've watched seventeen. Cradle of Fear is the worst of them by a country mile, and I've seen some real dogs in the last seven days.

To attempt to describe the plot of this monstrosity, which is a loosely-linked anthology film, would not only waste far more time than I already have wasted on this movie, but would be doomed to failure in any case. The film does have something resembling a plot, but it exists solely to justify endless scenes of gore. Which is not something I usually mind in a movie, but in this case, it's so obvious that it's almost daring the viewer to hate it. And once again, that's not something I'd normally complain about--I've been singing Andrei Iskanov's praises for years now--but it's not even good gore. The special effects are one step above the kind of thing you see in no-budget amateur flicks shot by drunk guys in their backyards.

I have a strong suspicion that the only reason this film got made is because Cradle of Filth vocalist Dani Filth wanted to break into the acting business. That Mr. Filth has not gotten a single live-action big-screen job since should tell you all you need to know. This isn't only the worst of the films I've seen this week, it's arguably the worst I've seen all year. A complete and utter waste of time.

Make sure you have the popcorn, sodas (or Beer) and the whole nine yards.  This is the greatest movie any family could ask for (It's a movie that kinda brings the whole family a little closer and makes them bond together).  After that intro, let's get on with the review.

Cradle Of Fear unfolds four short pieces all linked by an incarcerated child-killer wreaking vengeance on those responsible for his imprisonment. Helped by deranged Dani Filth, who leaves a trail of entrails in his wake, the cannibal convict forces two goth vamps to endure a one night stand from Hell, two tough female robbers to kill each other, a rich one legged coke-head to chop up more than a few lines and an internet junkie to descend into madness when he uncovers the ultimate web depravity.

This is an Anthology Film that links four short stories together.  Now for the breakdown of the film.

Kemper is a child killer and cannibal who wants revenge on the people who sent him down (to the institution). He uses poor penmanship and blood from pricking his finger to contract 'The Man' to kill them in e-vil and satanic ways. The Man walks like a bad cross between 'The Crow' and 'Freddy Kreuger' with goth spiky rings and big black boots. We see Detective Neilson check the pulse of one victim before we see what happened (and Boy O' Boy does he have a way to check her pulse).

Story One - Nightclubbing
Two goth vamps go clubbing. Mel is in search of her 'Dark Prince' and spies him from across a crowded dance floor (The Man - Dani Filth). She doesn't have any idea what awaits her.  After taking him back to her place and seducing him with her slow striptease and slipping some kind of drug in their drinks, they make the 'BEAST' (Literally) and the next scene you see Mel in the shower bleeding. Feeling used and abused she showers and pukes (and what a nasty/long puke scene), running through the streets having ""Jacob's Ladder Like"" visions of demonic faces. She thinks she is tripping (On Acid or Something) and runs to her friend Nikki's house. At night they both find out what can happen when you don't use contraception (With a Demon) as the room is bathed in blood after a DIY (Do It Yourself) abortion.

Story Two - Hatching Plots
Next, two girls decide to break into a house when the old pensioner who lives there is out. Stumbling around in the dark, they eventually find his money stashed under the bed. They also find out the old guy is still there as he leaps at them from his bed. After bludgeoning him to death, they realize he had his hearing aid off (Then he pops up again) this time to be stabbed, beaten again, before eventually dying. After bathing together, Sophie decides she can't trust Emma and decides to keep it all for herself. She 'Offs' Emma, cleans up and knocks herself out on the landing, only to wake up in the morning and find the bodies are gone. After running home and stripping off her clothes in the kitchen she admires the money, then toasts her success before a very dead Emma rams the bottle into her eye as the old man throttles the last breath from her body.

Story Three - Driving Over The Influence
Next, a coke snorting couple drive around London running over a drunk man before popping back (To their crib) to have rampant stumpy love. Except the husband can't go through with it, even when presented with Eileen Daly's gorgeous charms as he feels like (Half a man) with only one leg. He is convinced that a new leg could be grafted on, providing there is a donor limb. He decides to pay a visit to an old friend with the worst hygiene in England (God knows why he believes this guy's leg would graft onto anything other than fungus) and promptly shoots and dismembers him (Pretty gruesome scene here folks). After the leg is sewn on, Nick is plagued by bad dreams and decides when it is finally rehabilitated, he will show his wife how much of a man he is. They go on another coke spree to warm up before a night of passion, only to have the possessed limb spring to life and take over his driving. The car crashes after a couple Surreal driving scenes and it is a blood bath for the whole family to enjoy (Eileen, Stumpy, Policeman, Etc.).

Story Four - Final Warning
Lastly, Detective Neilsons' son is busy compiling a report on snuff and pedophilia sites for a web company. He stumbles across a snuff site called 'The Sick Room' where you can pay to have people killed in the method of your choosing. He takes one of the girls from the office out on a date, only to leave her looking like a smashed-up, stitched-up victim of punishment. His boss and colleagues are suspicious when she doesn't return to work and get increasingly annoyed by his frustrated rantings as he tries to access The Sick Room again and again. He is fired and, after he spends all his money killing someone on the site, degenerates into a homeless bum. He is obsessed by finding out about the site, eventually being lured to a cottage in North London and finding out where they get the victims for the site. The Moral Being: Make sure you pay your subscription fees or is it curiosity that killed the cat?

We don't care as we are desensitized to all violence and gore by this time (We Believe) as Detective Neilsons', intent on revenge, goes to visit Kemper. Forcing his way into Kemper's cell in the Asylum, he shoots Kemper before the room is filled with security guards in padded riot gear. The Man (Dani) enters and we realize there is still more gore in store as he lays waste to the entire squad of guards. He attends to Kemper who we realize is his father before carelessly loosing his head in a gunshot blast. Just when we think Neilson will have the last laugh, an Alien/Demon/Spider-ish thing leaps from The Man's head and the film Thankfully ends (By this time everyone looks at one another and says 'What did we just watch'?)

Bring two vomit bags when viewing this film (One for you and the other for Grandma).  This is a movie 'Unlike' any I've seen before (And I've seen alot of crazy movies), it's not exactly Hollywood style and that's why I like it (And why everyone should start watching Underground Movies like this one).  As the back cover of the DVD states ""I have seen the future of British Horror, and his name is Alex Chandon!""  This is an exceptional piece of work (Art-Like Horror), a movie that should be seen by all.  [...]",1144454400,9,6566,4.475752508361204

BUT!! Fans of Cradle of Filth will obviously see this just because Dani Filth is in it (I'll admit thats the only reason I heard of it). But also if you just want to watch mindless mayhem with no remorse, this along with the Guinea Pig Series are about the best recent choices to see.

The movie plays out in kind of a ""Tales from the Crypt"" way. There are four short unassociated stories that form the movie.

So if you want to see Dani Filth in a movie, If you want to see alot of mindless violence, or just something different - I would certainly recommend it.",1108684800,,796,4.293333333333333

This Film has an excellent story-line combining several stories into 1 on-going event. In my opinion the acting is NOT bad at all, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC!! I love Cradle Of Filth to begin with, so having Dani Filth playing a lead part was a great bonus!!(He really does a good job!!) There is PLENTY of BLOOD and GORE for you Gorehounds out there!!! The really only dissapointing thing about this film is the Production. If this film had a Bigger budget it really would be a spectacular Horror film!! I have actually heard rumors of the film being re-done with a bigger budget, but unfortunately I cannot confirm if this is true.(We will have to wait and see!!) I have shown this film to several of my friends and after watching once or twice (to get use to the camcorder style filming effect- due to low movie budget) they ALL have agreed they really LIKE it!!Cradle Fans will LOVE this movie and I think it is definately worth checking into for just the simple fact that it IS a GOOD Horror film in general. The film is directed by the same fellow who directed Cradle Of Filth's ""From The Cradle To Enslave"" video:Alex Chandon. I recommend giving this Film a try and form your own opinion before passing this Horror Gem up!!I REALLY hope they do go back and Re-make this film!!(with a bigger budget) Then it would be Perfect! This Is a really good film to watch ALONE IN THE DARK!! I hope my review was helpful to you!! LONG LIVE METAL!!! (PS:) GREAT JOB DANI!!!!",1107907200,,1600,4.4271186440677965

You will read warnings that the movie is extremely gory, but I personally didn't find it gory enough!  I was expecting some really disquisting scenes (after the first short film), but was really disappointed when there wasn't :-(
If you're a true ""gorehound"", this movie just doesn't cut it.  But if you like Dani Filth, then it is definitely worth a watch ;-)

Dani wasn't even that bad, the movie was just terrible. Some of the actors were laughable in their performance! However, the girls are all really hot and have nice....FEATURES, I'll say! ^_^ Also, the DVD might actually be (somewhat) worth buying if it was priced at, say, $5?!

1819264,4,B00007L4N4,"I have been collecting horror movies for quite a long time now, and I'm happy to say that London's ""Cradle of Fear"" is a relentless cult film that will undoubtedly offend conservative viewers and titillate all sex fiends! A must warn you all, however, that this low-budget flick isn't perfect: the film was shot entirely on video and includes alot of soft porn dialogue, amateurish acting, and cheesy gore effects. Still, with enough blood, topless girls, and vomit to spill over the exploitation genre, ""Cradle of Fear"" can easily make Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"" look tame. And of course,  rock screecher Dani Filth is given his first starring role. What I can say in absolute confidence is that this anthology is a black metal blood feast guaranteed to satisfy every occultist's desire for the terminally sick!
 Kemper (David McEwan), a crazed child murderer and Satanic hypnotist, is imprisoned within the concrete walls of Fenham Asylum. Despite this, he calls upon his own son and follower, ""The Man"" (Dani Filth), to wreck havoc on society by painting the streets with blood and death. ""The Man,"" by the way, is sort of like ""The Crow,"" except he has supernatural powers and an insatiable lust for killing. Meanwhile, an embittered Detective Neilson (Edmund Dehn) is forced to investigate the crimes. As each twisted tale unfolds, Neilson becomes hellbent on destroying Kemper by any means necessary.
 Story #1: Melanie (Emily Bouffante) is a sexy Goth chick who meets ""The Man"" in a rave club. Anticipating a hot night of passion and drugs, Mel gets more than she bargains for as her partner gives her a monstrous one-night stand. The very next day, after seeing several hallucinating images of demons walking up and down the sidewalk, she dies of a nightmare pregnancy as a grossly deformed child with spider legs bursts out of her stomach!
 Story #2: Sophie (Rebecca Eden) and Emma (Emma Rice) are a pair of tough street girls who attempt to rob a rundown apartment. While discovering a huge sum of money under the bed, the two are suddenly attacked by a crazed old man (Al Stokes). Together, the terrified Sophie and Emma bludgeon him with a candlestick and stab him in the face with a knife. Then, Sophie murders Emma to snatch the money all for herself. As you horror fans might have guessed, both Emma and the Old Man return to life as zombies and give poor Sophie an eyeful of their wrath!
 Story #3: Nick (Louise Brownsell) is a rich and greedy businessman who lost one of his legs in a car accident (undoubtedly because he and his lover Natalie (Eileen Daly) snorted cocaine behind the wheel). Determined to be a whole man again, he sinks to new lows with both a gun and a knife. He shoots Thomas (Neil Keenan), a local slob and former friend, carves off one of his legs, and forces a doctor to perform the surgery. At first, all seems well in Nick's physical therapy. However, as he and Natalie go out on a drug-infused joyride, Nick's new appendage takes on a life of its own, refusing to accept its current owner.
 Story #4: Detective Neilson's own son, Richard (Stuart Lang), is an office employee who develops a dangerous addiction to Internet snuff and porn. Knowing this was his weekness, ""The Man"" entices Richard with -The Sick Room-, an interactive website where members can torture and kill their victims with just a few clicks of a button. After losing his job and his home to this perverse obsession, Richard searches for the site only to be led down a trail of madness... and his execution is ready to be broadcast.
 With cannibalism, dismemberment, and Devil imagery at every turn, ""Cradle of Fear"" is quite campy at some moments, although the movie overall was intended to be serious. Viewers will definitely laugh, of course, at the scene where where Dani Filth stabs a pussycat and swallows its mutilated organs in one gulp! Yes, it's THAT over-the-top! Both disturbing and fun at once, the DVD is worth the money. Get it when you can, creeps!",1091577600,15,3987,4.7612156295224315

Alex chandon has worked with them several times on videos such as her ghost in the fog, from cradle to enslave, and has helped in other videos, and dvds. I loved this particularly for the all around underground feeling to it. If you are interested in it: ""dont have pre-assumptions about it, keep up with cradle of filth, and alex chandon"". That would be my advice to any one thinking about buying this movie.",1082937600,4,521,4.494736842105263
1819267,5,B00007L4N4,"First of all i'm going to say...this movie flat out rules! If you like Cradle of Filth, you must own this, along with all of their 3 official DVD workings.(Those being Heavy Left Handed and Candid, Pandaemonaeon, and Cradle of Fear.)
Cradle of Fear, the simply put title for this bloodbath of macabre horror, is a B-movie constructed by director Alex Chandon (whom also directed From the Cradle to Enslave, [Cradle of Filth's first promotional music video.] Pervirella, Bad Karma..etc.) and a well constructed B-movie it is.
As the DVD package indicates, this movie has ""enough blood and guts to satisfy even the most terminal gorehounds."" If you're squeemish, don't like the sight of violence and blood and gore, or can't stand Cradle of Filth...forget this movie, its brilliance isn't for you.
But for those of you whom are hungry to see Dani Filth go at it with his Sadistic mind and his ever so sharp and sweet looking Finger Armor...get this DVD, it's great!
The movie consists of 4 stories, revolving around the ex-child rapist/cannibal/hypnotist, Kemper. The movie is basically about him getting revenge upon those whom had him thrown in the Insane Asylum. He does this through ""The Man"" played by none other than Dani Filth. So as indicated, Dani (The Man) literally has all these people destroyed..in seriously violent ways.
I'm not going to give anything away as to how or why, anymore..but just know, this movie is seriously violent when it comes to Dani Filth killing people.
The movie lacks in graphics and acting...those are its only flaws. While yes theres ALOT OF F**KING GORE in the movie, there lacks alot of realism. You can tell alot of it is fake, but remember, this IS a B-movie (movie with a low budget, for those whom didn't know what a B-movie was.) and the fact it has a low budget shows.
The movies sound effects are also really cheesy, it sounds like they took kick and punch and blah blah...right out of the Power Rangers TV show and used them on this movie. I'm not one to complain when it comes to Cradle of Filth or the genius work of Alex Chandon unless necessary but those sound effects were childish and definantly weren't necessary.
The acting is remotely crap...Dani Filth doesn't even seem like he's even acting throughout this movie. He seems to be more like the ""look around, and gawk, and stare, and stalk people"" kind of person in this movie, if you ask me. But i'll tell you, he can do a badass job at acting like he's killing someone! The acting of other characters at times can also be cheesy, and the sound effects sure don't help them along. (i.e. girl puking in toilet..bleh stupid.)
Other than these things, if you can get past them, the movie is a top notch macabre, campy horror film that all fans of B-movies, and maybe fans of british director Alex Chandon will definantly enjoy. I'd give this movie 10 stars if I could...
Heh, can't wait for the sequel, Cradle of Fear 2..hopefully it'll be better than this is.",1081123200,3,2965,4.681992337164751
1819273,4,B00007L4N4,"This film is a piece of trash, and thats why I loved it. As a fan of Cradle of Filth I enjoyed it immensly as i got to see Dani trying to act. And i do mean trying as the acting in this film is beyond S#!t, but thats what makes it great. The special effects are nice and dodgy, lots and lots of blood everywhere.
Its actually a shame that the acting is a bit dodgy as one of the story's is brilliant.
the story in question is the story about the sick room and this is pretty much essential even if you don't like horror. It is writen brilliantly and Chandon deserves all the praise in the world for writing a story like this.
The soundtrack on this film is great too as Black metal and electronica are mixed together to produce a nice piece of ecclectica.
the bottom line is if you are a fan of any of the following: Cradle of Filth, Horror, old video nasties, trash culture or just fun then get this film. You don't need to own it but try and see it at least.",1078876800,,960,4.005208333333333

I had reasearched and eventually bought this movie because I am a huge fan of Cradle Of Filth and thought it would be awesome to see Dani as the main role in a horror movie, and indeed it was, though it didn't show him enough. The movie was overall well casted and acted out, though sometimes a line or two will be really cheesy, I guess that's what I was expecting anyways though, it adds some fun. You definitely get all the blood, guts and gore you want in this film and it is a purchase well made. Dani and the boys have uncovered plans to make another film, hopefully the budget is bigger for that, I would like to see him casted in something along the lines of Lord of The Rings mixed with the non stop death element of Cradle of Fear,now that would be metal.

Nonetheless, the gore is why I gave the movie 3 stars as opposed to 2....for a lower budget film, I thought they did an excellent job.  The sound effects were, however, exaggerated and occassionally cartoonish.

1819276,1,B00007L4N4,"CRADLE OF FEAR had nothing to offer for me at all. I bought it because I am a huge fan of the horror/gore genre and I am also a fan of the British metal band ""Cradle Of Filth,"" which relates to the movie because the bands frontman Dani Filth is the slasher in this film. There was alot of positive reviews on the movie that made it look very positive.
  The film consists of four gore filled short stories linked poorly by Dani Filth ""The Man"" coming in to claim his victems in a gory and fake fashion. The f/x in this film are not very convincing.
  The filming is done in a way that the screen picture through out the film looks not like most motion pictures, but like a very unprofessional, cheaply done movie made with a home recorder. All the props look fake and look like little effort was put into them. For example, the scenes shot it the asylem...the interior of the serial killers room looks like a room with regular pillows stapled to the walls. Another fake scene is where there is a car racing at dangerous speeds through the city and gets hit by a semi. The cars in this scene look like toy cars and is actually humourous to watch and cannot be taken seriously.
  Then the sound quality factor...is terrible. Every action in the movie is accompanied by the dubbing of a fake sound effect. Such as punching, kicking, slashing etc. They sound like video game sounds.
  I give the film a single star (out of five) and do not recommend it to anyone unless you are in for a good laugh. The plot sounds good reading it on the back of the dvd, but causes alot of dissapointmet when watched. I would honestly say it is the worst horror movie I have ever watched.",1073088000,2,1668,4.306709265175719
1819277,5,B00007L4N4,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this film, but I got it just because it featured Count Filth as an actor, and I knew that at least would be entertaining in itself.  Well, Dani should do more horror films.  He's good at killing people, and as you'll see in one part, eating cat innards (take that, ASPCA!!!).  It's lots of blood and guts, and the storyline takes some time to make sense of, but if you're a fan of Cradle of Filth or you love bloody movies, then you should watch this.  The snuff addict is really funny!",1072828800,,527,4.292929292929293
1819278,3,B00007L4N4,"Cradle of Fear is a shot-on-video cheapie containing bad acting, poor special effects and lots of graphic gore.  It also serves as somewhat of a vehicle for singer Dani Filth of the world's leading black metal band Cradle of Filth. Britain is a country that although very prominent in horror litterature, seems to be surprisingly devoid of quality modern-day horror films.  In fact I haven't heard of any aside from 28 days later and the Hellraiser films, so I was eager to give this one a try.
The film is a collection of 4 shorts interconnected together by a similar premise.  A crazed hypnotist is handed a life sentence after it was found that he used his hypnotising powers to lure children, kill them and then eat them.  Not content to simply rot away in jail, he calls upon his son (""The Man"" played by Dani Filth) to dispatch the relatives of those who had a hand in incarcerating him.  In the first story, a young woman picks up Filth at a goth club and brings him to her place.  After a weird night of subliminal [intercourse], the woman wakes up feeling physically changed.  As she walks the streets downtown, she is able to see what the average person can not, that some people among the crowd have horns for ears and are in fact demons (a similar premise to John Carpenter's ""They Live"").  She soon comes to the horrific realization that she herself is now among the undead.  My personal favourite story is ""The Sick Room"", where an office worker obsesed with surfing porn sites stumbles upon an interactive snuff web site where ""You are the Killer"".  The outrageously expensive website consumes the man until he is forced to be way more involved with ""The Sick Room"" than he would like to be.
From the opening scene where Filth walks into an alleyway and dispatches a couple of thugs trying to rob him, you can see in what this direction this film is going.  ...  No doubt many people will be offended by this movie and anyone looking for a cohesive storyline better look elsewhere.  The gore is beyond belief.  It would be easy to slam this film for its horid acting and laughable special effects (the car crash the most obvious example) but that would be beyond the point.  This is not meant to be horror in the traditional sense, this is meant to be trash cinema and good trash cinema this is, delivering tons of laughs and creative gore effects.
The soundtrack fits the mood perfectly, a pounding industrial and black metal score laced with EBM and darkwave sounds.
As for Dani Filth's ""acting"", it is practically non-existent.  Filth pretty much serves two purpose only; to stand around like a boogeyman and to administer gruesome deaths.  He never utters a word throughout the entire movie, except in one gruesome scene where he sacrifices a cat as part of a satanic ritual.  At least he does do a good job looking intimidating, just don't expect any acting.  Think of it more as him playing his part in another Cradle of Filth rock video.
Despite the innumerable artistic flaws, Cradle of Fear is definitely great fun.  I never found myself bored throughout the film.  I would recommend this for fans of the Creepshow films looking for something gorier.  I do think the British critic's blurb on the front of the DVD's box is a little on the extreme side of things however.  In yet another spin-off of an old Stephen King quote he says about the film and its director:  ""I have seen the future of horror: His name is Alex Chandon"".  While I did find the film entertaining in a trashy kind of way, if a movie like Cradle of Fear really is to be the future of horror then us genre fans might be in for some trouble...",1071878400,,3636,4.548387096774194
1819279,5,B00007L4N4,"This movie is everything I thought that it would not be. And the first thing I thought it would not be, is good. I thought ""Musician+Movie=Bad thing"" once I saw ""8 Mile""(which sucked BTW!) But Cradle of Fear, Hell I'll tell ya, It's actually quite a good movie for a low budget one, with an awesome plot. The story is about a commited child killer and cannibal who used to work as a hypnotist. But this killer secretly was killing children at his shows by subliminally giving them commands to do his bidding, then he killed them. He was caught, and eventually imprisoned and thrown into an asylum. Here he dwells in an asylum, going mad. He calls upon ""The Man"" (played by none other than Dani Filth) to kill those who have wronged him by having him imprisoned. This is where the FUN begins in the movie. The Man ends up killing the series of people in many frenzied gory ways, only to die by having his head blown in half in the end. We then discover that The Man is actually the son of the child killer cannibal, whom also ""dies"". Then the actual ENDING...MAN I'LL TELL YOU IT RULED! Never would have expected THAT to happen. I won't give it away, but the end was simply amazing and a huge huge shocking suprize.
The only thing this movie really lacks, is better graphics in the gore. I mean, you can tell when Dani Filth is ripping a guys head apart in the begining, that It's totally fake. A better more realistic gore scene is when the ""baby"" bursts out of the woman. And then, the final gore in the movie where Dani stabs and slices and slits a few people to shreds.
All in all, this movie deserved way more than just 5 stars, it deserves 100!

1819282,5,B00007L4N4,"Now the main reason many of you would hear about this movie would most likely be because Cradle Of Filth frontman Dani Filth has a prominent role in the film (it's ok that is how i heard about it too). Furthermore, the rest of the band has cameos throughout the movie too, but that is beside the point. Let it be said that this film has a lot of blood and guts, which is just grand! However, some of the dialogue and acting seems quite cheesy, which could be the desired effect. Either way, if you enjoy campy and gore-filled horror flicks, then this movie is right up your alley. It is certainly worth the money, as the comes in just a few seconds under 2 hours in length. The story is decent one to follow, and this movie is good if you want to have a fun romp through murder and mayhem without having to do too much thinking. I will say this though, and this is purely my opinion only: this movie is not all that scary (maybe its because im desensitized beyond redemption). If you're looking for a horror movie that will actually scare the life out of you, i urge you to look elsewhere. However, as i said before, if you want a good time filled with lots of blood, and at times, some really funny and corny dialogue, then this movie is for you!

Its not some trashy horror film that is just a bunch of teenagers running around naked and gettin killed. It really has some good twists and turns witch makes it good. The acting is good for a bunch of musicans better than rappers doing acting thats for sure.

Loved the cat scene! This is far as my positives go though. This movie cost way too much for what it was: a beyond B horror movie
  This wasn't just Elvira cheesy, this was border line home video cheesy. (if anyone out there thought Blair Witch's production was bad, which I liked, this is far worse). If you want to know what you will be seeing, imagine those late night TV shows on the BBC. I kept waiting for Benny hill or Monty python to pop out of the blood wake some place!!
  The sound was terrible, you have to turn it way up to hear what they are saying (maybe its a combination of bad sound and heavy accents) but by the time you turn it up to hear it, a loud noise or background music will near blast your ears out (a lot of movies are guilty of this lately, however this one seems a little worse than normal.)
  One other thing: this moving claims to be the goriest movie ever. Could it be that I have become so desensitized to movies I would go as far as to say this needed more gore? The gore was far apart, and there was a lot of slow spots. Be prepared to sleep on a couple of these stories, especially the last one! Plus when you finally do get treated to a gore scene, (with the exception of the first few kills in the beginning sequence) most of these are very unoriginal, and have all been done before. The latex FX are pretty sad too....",1051747200,3,1523,4.145762711864407
1819304,5,B00007L4N4,"This movie was totally different than I thought it would be, but it is very great. This movie is a total gore-filled, blood drenched horror flick. This movie revolves around 4 separate stories that all relate together which I think is an interesting concept. The best story by far, however would have to be the story that involves ""The Sick Room"". The shocking ending is amazing, and the gore is top notch. I can honestly say this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Dani Filth is simply a god, simply a god. I would like to see him in more horror movies of this caliber, maybe even one with a higher budget that could possibly get released in theatres? Not likely, but it could happen.

1819305,1,B00007L4N4,"I used to work at Blockbuster video and rented this based purely upon the fact it was a horror film and it had a pretty funky cover. The movie is the least scary horror film I've ever seen, the filming is utterly apalling, the acting dire and the effects more pitiful than a student film. What about the plot? What bloody plot? It's a series of random stories that they tried to splatter with as much gore as possible. And not even convincing gore.
The two computer generated effects used in the film look ... there's absolutely no suspense. I even had to fast forward through a fair wack of it. I've noticed people on here saying the effects were excellent... what film were you watching? Take that scene where the car shoots across the road, it looks like the introduction to Eurotrash. And there's a really awful looking puppet in there.
This is seriously, the ONLY film I have ever recommended someone not to rent throughout my time working as a video store clerk.

1819306,1,B00007L4N4,"Cradle of Fear.  I'll have to say this movie was VERY BAD.  I thought I'd give this dvd a rental. I was curious and am a big horror movie buff, from The Hill's Have Eyes to Evil Dead series.  I went in not expecting much, and hoo-boy this movie just stunk!  HOWEVER the FX was top notch. After watching an hour I got to thinking thats all the movie was about, SPECIAL EFFECTS. Some disturbing, but after awhile you ask where's the storyline? I don't know much about the musican, but he was way too GOTH and not very scary. After the Man killed a cat, I thought , Wow what a waste, Trying to shock, but just plain lousy. Want to watch a great british horror movie see DOG SOLDIERS.",1048636800,2,680,4.1679389312977095
1819307,4,B00007L4N4,"OK, I am a COF fan so I may be a bit biased, but this is a pretty good(and gory as hell) film that will fit into your horror collection nicely.  Taking a cue from ""Creepshow"", it follows 4 different stories that all have one basic connection, that being ""the man""(Dani Filth).  Apparently all of the stories victims have relatives that have imprisoned some crazy child murderer so to extract his revenge he calls upon the man - chaos and carnage ensue.
While this is low budget, it is far from the junk I have spent my money on in the past.  I mean it's uncanny - the plot makes sense!  It's not boring!  The F/X are well done!  It doesn't pull any punches either!
I wish Hollywood would take a cue from this movie and start making horror movies with umm, ""round things"" again.",1046131200,9,777,4.324137931034483
7977864,1,B00007L4N4,"So I used to own this movie on DVD. And I enjoyed it. But this is just stupid. Why are all the sounds removed? Why is all the music removed? The original obvi is not like that. The actual DVD copy has CoF music in it and the normal sounds you hear on movies in everyday life: cars driving, walking, ECT. The literal only sound you hear on this version is the dialogue. I'm a Cradle fan I wanna hear the music. I wanna hear the blood gush. If you're going to remove all the sounds, why even have it available for stream?

I turned on subtitles, and it would say things like ""heavy metal music playing"", when the movie is completely silent...  tried skipping ahead and reloading, but same problem...  the only audio appears to be when people are actually talking...  all the music, fx sounds, even things like people walking or opening doors are completely silent...

7977871,3,B00007L4N4,"Well, it certainly had a decent amount of gore and not everyone's acting was terrible. However, overall, it was laughably one of the worst movies I've seen... and that's saying a lot. Sure, it was entertaining, but probably not in ways it intended. I do recommend viewing it, simply because it must be seen to experience the true cluster crap of it all.
