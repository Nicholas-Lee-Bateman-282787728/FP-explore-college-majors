210198,2,630015467X,"I have owned numerous copies of The Velveteen Rabbit on VHS by FHE.  I have never had a good quality tape yet and this latest one is especially awful.  The sound quality was faded right from the start.  As a Mom of an Autistic child that loves to rewind, and play the same part over, this tape cannot handle it.  It will bend, curl so easily.  I have had Disney movies last for years, like 10 years.  I love this movie and I just hope they put it on DVD soon.",1220832000,,459,3.989010989010989
210199,5,630015467X,"Every child should have this tape.  It has a touching story, great graphics and terrific narration.  You can't help but fall in love with the little velveteen rabbit!",1201737600,,166,4.892857142857143
210200,3,630015467X,"My daughter introduced me to THE VELVETEEN RABBIT when she was five and we  read it together until she knew it by heart.  I was reluctant at first to  view the filmed version of the story; too many of my favorite books had  been badly adapted to the screen, their plot telescoped to accommodate  intrusive songs and music and irrelevant characters.  However, this  animated version of THE VELVETEEN RABBIT has managed to keep the emotional  content and magic of the original story.  The graphics are predictable and  rather trivial except for the RABBIT himself who is very appealing.  END",907200000,8,589,4.848484848484849
7803274,4,630015467X,"if you love the book you will like this animated version, i still have my original vhs copy of this movie, and its cool to see it re-realesed on dvd, its a good adaption of the book version i used to get read this story as a young kid from my great grandmother, long before i ever saw this movie version of it, and she was in love with the book, but myself i was never a big fan of the story as i always hated the ending, so happy and so sad all at the same time, but still a pretty good story, and just like the ending of the book the ending of this movie always makes me cry, this is a good story for all ages.",1465430400,,612,3.751937984496124
7803275,5,630015467X,Thrilled to find this.  My kids had it when they were little.  Wanted a copy for my grandkids.  Great service from seller!,1454457600,,122,4.454545454545454
7803276,2,630015467X,"picture quality poor.  only a little better than the video I was replacing.
tracking was off.  audio was ok, but picture too shakey",1395964800,,131,4.6521739130434785
7803277,5,630015467X,"This animated adaptation of The Velveteen Rabbit is my favorite version of the classic story. I used to watch this version of The Velveteen Rabbit on VHS tape all the time as a child.  The Faery Queen's song makes me tear up, even now. This is a beautiful, and very under-rated version of The Velveteen Rabbit. I have fond nostalgic memories of this version of the story. And now that I'm older I can appreciate Christopher Plumber (the only good thing about Dracula 2000) providing the gentle narrations. And I love the Chuck Jones style humor of the toy soldiers with their small subplot about being jealous of the toy rabbit.",1389484800,,628,4.657657657657658

7803279,5,630015467X,"I grew up watching this movie, when I moved from CA I lost it and was heartbroken that I wouldn't be able to share it with my kids. I'm so glad that I was able to find it again!!",1353888000,,178,3.58974358974359
7803280,5,630015467X,THIS WAS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIES FROM WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I PURCHASED IT TO WATCH AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL I WORKED AT. THE KIDS LIKED IT BUT IT WAS HARD TO HOLD THE SMALLER CHILDRENS ATTENTION (18 MONTHS - 3 YEAR OLDS) BUT THE OLDER CHILDREN LIKED THE STORY BEHIND IT. STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITES!,1351209600,,303,4.1525423728813555
7803281,5,630015467X,So excited to show my daughter one of my favorite childhood movies. I loved it as a child and I hope she does too! Great product!,1326240000,,129,4.0
7803282,5,630015467X,"This purchase was made for my girlfriend (ex now) because she wanted to re-live some of her childhood memories of this classic character. And boy did it work! Every now I then, I like to take a trip down memory lane. For me, it's other characters and other movies, but for her, this one did the trick.

As for the product itself, it was a VHS tape. The quality is nothing compared to DVD, but this item was a pretty hard find and the price couldn't have been better. I bought it used and it still plays perfectly after all these years.",1318896000,,535,4.245098039215686
