5002478,5,B006L7BXWA,"Where can I start? This was the greatest season of BYU Basketball that I have ever witnessed. I wasn't around in the Ainge years, but this season was fantastic. This documentary goes fairly deep into the season. There are interviews with the entire team, the coaches, Steve Young, Dick Vitale and a short one with Danny Ainge interspersed throughout.

I was really pleasantly surprised about how well it's done. Full feature length, well lit, well shot, and there's a whole bunch of footage that I don't remember seeing on TV. This really is a very comprehensive film covering everything from local press to ESPN & NCAA footage on a national level. They have the President talking about Jimmmer for goodness sakes.

There are some pretty good special features too. There are extended interviews with Coach Rose, Jimmer and Dick Vitale. Coach Rose and Jimmer's are about 20 min each, and Dick Vitale's is shorter, like 8-10 min. Trailers, a fan made music video and a funny section of player profiles in which the players describe each of their teammates.

Overall, a great product and probably the ultimate way to re-live to live the most EPIC season of BYU Basketball ever. EVER.",1323820800,3,1180,4.8606965174129355

5002483,5,B006L7BXWA,"It's a shame that the NBA has become such reverse racists, otherwise Jimmer would be a perennial all-star. Oh well, at least BYU is still kicking butt. We barely missed the big dance this year, but Coach Rose will take us all the way in 2016!",1427328000,,242,4.282608695652174
5002484,5,B006L7BXWA,"One man stands alone.  The hardwood is his battlefield.  His quest: the glory of a Sweet Sixteen.

But the trail is hard and the journey is long.  He knows what his future holds: challenges...anguish...obstacles...  But in the end: redemption...the Sweet Sixteen trophy...NBA stardom.  Amazing.

Jimmer Fredette traveled two thousand miles to join a down-and-out, rag-tag team of misfit players who could only dream of basketball glory.  For years, the team had struggled in vain to taste of national prominence.  Haunted by the ghosts of 30-years ago, they began to doubt.  But Jimmer saw something special deep in the heart of this squad.  And over the course of the 2010-11 season, he helped transform the BYU Cougars into a dynamic squad of power players to compliment his own ability to take control of a game and score more points than you can count.  Together, they became an unstoppable force and accomplished what few basketball teams have ever done: an appearance in the Sweet Sixteen.

This is his story.",1427328000,6,1015,5.005988023952096

5002486,5,B006L7BXWA,BYU fans and Jimmer fans will love this show. It was a great year and reliving it brought back all of the joy and pain of Jimmer's senior year. Jimmermania was an awesome phenomenon of the kind that only makes it to Provo once in a generation.,1421280000,,243,4.191489361702128
5002487,4,B006L7BXWA,"As a BYU Alumni, I liked it. It gave me a relatively quick update on the ""Jimmer"" phenomenon that occurred there at BYU.",1408838400,,120,4.260869565217392
5002488,4,B006L7BXWA,My son enjoyed!,1405296000,,15,4.333333333333333
5002489,2,B006L7BXWA,"Watched the first 10 minutes of the movie, then skipped it. So I really don't know how good it is. It starts out like a documentary, so I assumed that it's just a documentary about one of BYU's successful seasons. Oh well.",1401062400,,222,4.309523809523809
5002490,3,B006L7BXWA,"Jimmer!
Amazing how some stars never do well in the NBA.  Movie didn't have enough action in it. Lots of guys talking",1397779200,,117,4.318181818181818
5002491,5,B006L7BXWA,I enjoyed it.  My wife who isn't a basketball fan also enjoyed it.  I recommend it to any BYU fans.,1391040000,,99,3.9
5002492,5,B006L7BXWA,"I am not a big sports fan and never watch sports documentaries. Don't know why I watched this -- it was an excellent production and very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone. Hard word does pay off, but -- talent is such a big factor when you're looking for the ""amazing"" results.",1389657600,,287,4.433962264150943
5002493,3,B006L7BXWA,"Did not watch more than 15 mins.  It seemed as it was going to be, too, much of the same thing over and over.",1379808000,,109,3.5416666666666665
5002494,3,B006L7BXWA,This was okay but it got old very fast and didn't hold my attention.  I guess it just wasn't what I had expected.  Glad I didn't pay for it.,1379030400,,140,3.793103448275862
5002495,3,B006L7BXWA,"This was a nice documentary,  but if you don't care much about basketball it is hard to watch.  I found my self fast forwarding through slow parts just to finish the story line.  Over all an inspiring movie.",1376352000,,207,4.394736842105263
5002496,5,B006L7BXWA,This was a great documentary about the jimmer phenomenon. Amazing to see this college basketball team become so great and in the blink of an eye become all that anyone talks about. Very fun and impressive to see the team work.,1369958400,,226,4.536585365853658
5002497,5,B006L7BXWA,BYU is a university that raises the bar for it's students and athletes.  When everyone shares a dream they can come true.,1360540800,,121,4.5
5002498,5,B006L7BXWA,"After watching the Blu Ray of ""Amazing: The Official 2010-11 BYU Basketball Documentary"" I can honestly say I re-lived the season through the movie. It takes the viewer on a journey through the inner circle of the team, storylines, player personalities, and stories through exclusive, in depth interviews with artistic touch and impressive style.

I know Jon Howe does great work and this might be his best ever. I loved the video. It was the season of Jimmer Fredette but also of a great team whose individual roles and stories are told in the movie.

The quality of the video is great, the content made me scream for joy and cry with sadness. I loved it. For fans of Jimmer or BYU Basketball, this is a must see.",1323907200,3,714,4.5703125
5002499,5,B006L7BXWA,"I got a real close look at this last season and was fortunate to be there in person for much of it.  I also had a chance to meet the guys; Jimmer, Jax, Logan and the boys and can say they are better people than basketball players.  Watching this production brings back some great memories.  I like hearing it from the guys point of view as well.  Also, to see guys like Dick Vitale and Danny Ainge in it was pretty cool to see.

This one will be played over and over again for years in my library of videos.",1323907200,4,507,4.03

8500261,3,B006L7BXWA,"It was OK, Jimmer was as sick a scorer in college as there has ever been, fearless from deep but the team didn't accomplish enough to warrant a movie called ""amazing"".",1469923200,,167,4.419354838709677
