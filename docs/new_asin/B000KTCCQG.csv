2697496,5,B000KTCCQG,"I remember watching this back in 1998 on VHS for the first time at 17 and I never forgot it. I always felt this movie had a great creepy atmospheric feel to it, and that the story was a step up from most 80's horror flicks I was watching at the time.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see a young Bill Paxton prior to Weird Science and Aliens playing a role I couldn't have imagined for him.  Needless to say this film is 80's horror fun at it's best and a refreshing change from a lot of other stuff out there.  Even if you're not a Bill Paxton geek like I am, it's definitely worth a watch!  If you're a 80's horror fanatic this is one for your collection.  It's creepy, it keeps you guessing, and seeing Bill Paxton do his little ""skip"" through the graveyard is just hilarious! I'm just elated that I finally found this on DVD remastered no less.  It's not a well known horror flick for the average film Joe, but it is a gem in the eyes of this horror fan and I'm sure many others.",1345766400,3,986,4.109375
2697497,3,B000KTCCQG,"After watching this 80s slasher flick, my review for this would probably say that it wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  Now we all know that 80s slasher flicks can be predictable, but this film is VERY predictable.  Any 80s Horror Collector will certainly add this to their collection, for those of you who are looking for an actual scare, well you might find this film to be boring. I collect horror films, so I am happy to add it to my collection.

I will say that the video quality was excellent, considering the age of this film.",1343520000,,529,4.43298969072165
2697498,2,B000KTCCQG,"Not what I had hoped for, this film barely classifies as a slasher film; you can count the number of victims on one hand, with a digit leftover!  The plot plods along in no hurry to get anywhere.  There's little in the way of suspense, no fright.  The pacing is way off; most scenes feel as if they're skipping a beat, trying to be something they're not.  There's no great secret who is doing what and why.  The villain is standard fare, employing the usual affectations: wild eyes and a crazy grin.  Even the ending is lazy.  For me, this was a huge disappointment.",1341619200,,566,4.384615384615385
2697499,5,B000KTCCQG,"This is an awesome legit release of one of the most neglected 80's horror gems out there! Bill Paxton, a Walton's girl, the husband and wife team of Christopher George (horror veteran) and Lynda Day George. What a cast! The picture quality on this is immaculate! There are a few white specs the first few minutes but they go away and soon you are left with a really top notch picture. Seeing new things for the first time with this (mostly better cleavage shots). Anyway, the movie itself is one worth picking up. This 1983 gem is the real deal. Used to rent this all the time in the 90's from used video stores. One of my favorites to rent back then. Also bought the VHS version back in the early 2000's and then had a hell of a time finding bootlegs of this a few years ago. I love Scorpion Entertainment and their rare picks they release on dvd. Wish they would release Blu-Ray but maybe that is for later. Love the setting of this movie in beautiful coastal California in the early 80's. There are plenty of cool Mortuary scenes and some very suspect people of being the killer. Anyway, this is the version to have and I will stop this review now for fear of more gloating. Love this gem!",1339200000,6,1192,4.349775784753363
2697500,4,B000KTCCQG,"This was one of those awesome horror movies from the eighties that we all flocked to with such enthusiasm. Come on it starred Mary McDonough of The Walton's fame. She had already been in the TV movie Midnight Offerings with costar Melissa Sue Anderson, the good girl from Little House on the Prairie. Which was also a recent hit TV show when that movie was made. This movie though had all of the obvious trappings of all of the bad dead teenager movies being released at the time but we still jumped at the red herrings and laughed at the bad acting and lame jokes. I have loved this movie forever and I'm so happy it has finally been released on DVD. Now I can have that movie marathon with Happy Birthday to Me and others from that time. I have to through in Terror Train and Prom Night for extra flavor! And some Jamie Lee Curtis action. Awesomely bad horror movies from the eighties. Loving it!!!",1338595200,8,900,4.395209580838324
2697501,4,B000KTCCQG,"I docked a star due to the fact that a little more nudity and gore would have been nice. The fast, repeated cut scenes during the kills makes it clear fast that the director didn't want to reveal that there really weren't any gore effects to speak of.

Bill Paxton as the crazy mortician's son is great and its nice to see him hamming it up in a retro 80's slasher from the VHS era. That was a total surprise. Christopher George (Pieces/City of the Living Dead) and his wife Linda (also Pieces) are great fun as usual. Horror fans will recognize them right away.

The only extra is an interview with the score composer, which was disappointing because the guy doesn't even remember making the music. He was pretty old. I guess no one else wanted to be a part of this DVD release. *shrug*

Other than being a little slow in the middle, I think all fans of 80's horror/slashers will enjoy this film and it certainly belongs in the collection along side all the other crazy films from the same era. Good fun.

I recommend all of Katarina's Nightmare Theater releases actually. They are unearthing these lost gems and I hope they continue to!",1337644800,4,1138,4.483091787439614
2697502,5,B000KTCCQG,"Mortuary hit video shelves about 1983 or 84 but looked ok back in the video day but it just kinda disappeared from home video completely. Now...thanks to Scorpion releasing it has been re-mastered to an HD quality format and looks very much worth the money it cost to purchase this dvd. This film has always been a favorite of mine since i seen it as a teenager and owned the vestron video copy. Now i can enjoy it again on dvd with nice color, nice audio, and on my 50 inch HD television without that horrible video cassette quality. I just gotta say JOB WELL DONE!!
NOW.....with the arrival of Bluray it should also be available in that format too.",1337212800,14,650,4.425
2697503,4,B000KTCCQG,"Favorite Movie Quote: ""He's got a little weird since his Mother committed suicide!""

I know this is telling my age but I am actually old enough to remember seeing this one at the local mall in 1983 with my mom. I was almost nine years old back then & I'm quite sure my mom was anything but thrilled with this film. Actually, I think she thought it was an ok film but simply believed that I was much too young to see it. Needless to say, I remembered the film fondly & even rented the VHS tape many moons ago. Mortuary was exactly the way I remembered it.

Fans of Bill Paxton SHOULD take note: This is perhaps one of his earliest roles & people who are familiar with his resume already know that Bill owns every role he accepts. This time, he really goes overboard with his character making this one of his most entertaining roles in my opinion. Paxton plays a geek who works for his father as an embabler in the local morgue, listens to Mozart, & fantasizes about the day he will marry his childhood crush Christy (Mary McDonough).

On the other hand, his father (played brilliantly by the late Christopher George) holds cult meetings where the members of his group chant & dance. Interesting family, eh? Ironically, Christy's mother also partakes in these bizarre meetings which could also suggest that she may also have some foul part in the recent murder.

Christy, however, has become obsessed with the recent tragic death of her father. As a result of this traumatic experience, she suffers from nightmares & sleepwalks. Convinced without a doubt that her father's death wasn't a mere accident, Christy is determined with the help of her boyfriend (David Wallace) to solve this mystery & to finally comes to terms with the truth. Naturally, no one buys her claims of a ghoulish paint-faced killer lurking in the shadows either & Christy begins to distrust everyone after discovering her mother belongs to a coven of witches.

Mortuary may not be the greatest slasher film of all-time but there some pretty incredible moments &  decent performances from familiar faces both young or old. Trust me, there are quite a few creepy moments & even some rather cool death scenes which include embalming equipment. Fans of early 80's slasher flicks should give this one a try.

Sadly, this one is not yet available on DVD to the best of my knowledge but I'm hoping this will come to pass. In the meantime, you can probably rent it from the old-fashioned VHS rental stores or look for used VHS tapes on Ebay. I am shocked that Code Red, Anchor Bay, or Blue Underground have not already released this little gem as a North American DVD release is long overdue.",1309219200,2,2655,4.636170212765958
2697504,3,B000KTCCQG,"A movie with a mortuary, a cult group and Bill Paxton is always worth watching. In this early work Paxton plays a geek that works as an embalmer at the local morgue, he enjoys Mozart and enjoys Christie (his childhood crush) even more. If his morbid job wasn't enough, his father owns the mortuary and in his free time does cult meetings with chanting and dances. His mother committed suicide when Paul (Bill Paxton ) was still a young boy and consequently he started seeing a shrink (Christie's father). That's when he first met Christie and as time goes by he becomes more and more detached of reality, wanting to marry her at any cost. Greg Stevens, Christie's boyfriend will have something to say about that.

Okay so this isn't the greatest film in the world. It's not even the greatest horror film, but fans of Bill Paxton have got to check out this movie. Paxton puts his all into making everyone of his characters entertaining and this film is no different. Bill really goes overboard with this character and it's a good thing because otherwise the movie would be pretty boring.  I had to rewind one scene several times I was laughing so hard at Paxton's antics.

I found the movie good, nothing extraordinary nor original, it's not extremely graphic but it has enough blood spilling. The acting is good, so is the score. It has some genuine scary moments and a reasonable plot.

I remember this movie giving me nightmares when I was younger and it truly has somewhat of an effect on me. Not sure how to describe it. I would recommend this!!,1406851200,,423,4.234567901234568

Together with her boyfriend they seek the truth, all the while a hooded man starts killing off specific characters. Once we know who all the characters are , we soon learn who the killer is and why he's slaying them. Bill Paxton fans this is a MUST to see him, he is incredible in this film.
The gore isn't too terribly graphic, there is some nudity..overall the film moves at a good pace leading to the climax.
Scorpions DVD treatment of this film is also great, coming from an HD master, and has a few extras to boot as well.

I wish it was, but I have seen Blu-ray versions of movies that look terrible compared to this. As for the film, I thought it was very well done.

2697515,5,B000KTCCQG,"We saw this movie back in the eighties at the movie theater. Then it came on VHS when VCRs were still rockin.' What makes it even better-it is now on DVD! Then we again decided to watch it,and oh,man-I've gotten that eighties feeling-back in the day when horror movies were rockin'! It was eerie,a little tragic,and just outright scary! What made me describe it as such is that the movie opens when a girl's father,a psychiatrist tries helping this guy who has mental problems,but he returns the favor by hitting him in the back of his head,killing him. And why? Because he doesn't want his daughter dating him. The guy's father commits suicide,and his mother is too incompetent to care for him,so the man at the mortuary cares for him. The girl,Christy witnesses her father's murder,she has nightmares,and sleepwalks,and tells her mother about it,but she's in denial. The mom is in some kind of 'cult' group,(mind you,) and later,she's tragically killed. You just have to see this movie to know what I am talking about. If you were around in the eighties,and saw this movie,then you will understand what I am saying to you. Yet overall,I enjoyed this movie-it was in great shape!

He's not bad at all, although the story is a little old hat and could use a little more blood and gore, especially since it was an 80's horror flick. Still, it a piece of history that should be seen by all 80's horror film fanatics. Those use to the United American VHS Video version of the film are in for a big surprise, since Scorpion Releasing struck a brand new widescreen transfer and the film never looked better. Extras are slim this time, with the original theatrical trailer and an on-camera interview with music composer John Cacavas.

2697519,4,B000KTCCQG,I bought this movie a couple months ago. From reading the reviews so many people posted i knew i was in store for a roller coaster like experience. When it finally arrived i popped it into the dvd player and started watching. What i got was something rarely seen in 80's horror movies. This started out like most of them but veered off to some other territory. This one adds to the traditional stalk and slash of these movies from that decade. Not only do we have a killer in a costume we have other story lines like a cult and creepy flashbacks. Although you can easily see what's going to happen this movie takes you there in some creative ways. Another plot is the main character keeps having nightmares where she sleep walks. While she sleep walks the cloaked killer seems to stalk her and call out her name. A truly creepy part is when she is having one of these episodes you are unsure wether she actually sees this dark killer or it is part of her imagination. These scenes alone creeped me out and that is not easy to do with me. There are some truly creepy moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. After this creepy middle part we are then subjected to the tradional revelation of the killer at the end where we hear their motive. The revelation of the killer didn't surprise me and it will probably not surprise you if you have half a brain. Some funny parts i would like to mention would be the often mention of Bill Paxton's character skipping through the grave yard. And one i found very funny is the killer driving behind our main character as she makes her way home. What i found funny about this scene is that the villain is driving in full costume. I know we need to keep the identity a secret but it would seem far fetched to have someone driving in a cloak and mask. You would think you could barely see out of that if you were driving somewhere. Other than that we are treated to some beautiful landmarks of the ocean and the hills. I recommend this movie. You won't be let down with a movie like this.,1366588800,,2034,4.299479166666667

Years later - I became aware of it's existence due to Bill Paxton's early career performance. However, the video stores in my area never stocked the film - and then the DVD/Digital age arrived. It was forgotten for some time - and then; the listing for this DVD release appeared on Amazon. I immediately pre-ordered and watched the film the moment it arrived. ""Mortuary"" has a great final act - and some legitimate surprises. It's a well-made picture - ahead of many slasher entries created during this era. It's just the first portion of the film could have used a little more oomph.

The DVD release from Scorpion features an amazing 16x9 transfer considering the scarcity of the source material.

This is recommended for die-hard 80's slasher fans - and those who are looking to re-discover forgotten horror films they may have missed from the greatest era of all.",1348185600,2,964,4.726190476190476

8159047,4,B000KTCCQG,"Mortuary was a horror film that features Bill Paxton, Mary Beth McDonough, David Wallace, Lynda Day George, and Christopher George,who appears in his final film. The movie centers on a hooded face painted killer who stabbed or impaled his victims on an embalm.

Greg and Christie are a young married couple who are investigating the mysterious death of Christie's father. Their search takes them to mortician Hank Andrews, who leads a Satanic cult along with his demented son Paul. However,even Christie's own mother may be in on the series of embalming-needle murders surrounding the mortuary.

The movie is an average horror film that barely scares the viewer. Also,the screenplay is decent. What makes this a better-than- average film are the performances of Bill Paxton and Lynda Day George,Mission Impossible TV series star.

8159051,3,B000KTCCQG,"As a fan of 80's horror, this was a movie I had always been planning on watching, but never actually got around to. I remember seeing the box sitting on the shelves of the various video stores I used to go to....but I never picked it, choosing other films instead. I'm not sure why? Maybe it was because the lead actress was ""Erin"" from ""The Waltons"" TV show, maybe it was the tag team duo of Christopher and Lynda Day George, they seem to show up in quite of few of these early 80's horror flicks; ""Pieces"", ""Graduation Day"", & ""City of the Living Dead"" to name a few.  Whatever it was, this film just never seemed to grab my interest.

I finally decided to give it a view, and while I did enjoy it overall, I'm not sure if I would recommend it. It's a pretty slow film, with a couple deaths occurring in the opening scenes, then a long slog through to the end when we finally get some more ""action"". Bill Paxton is definitely a highlight in the film, but the other performances are pretty dour. I will give it a few more points for providing a nostalgia flashback with the roller rink scenes, and the disco score, but unless you are a hardcore 80's horror junkie, you may want to pass.

A young girl named Christie begins having nightmares after her father dies. Christie believes he was murdered, but her mother and the rest of the town believe his death was accidental. Christie's boyfriend, Greg, is doing is best to believe her, but he's having his own trouble after his best friend Josh disappears from the local mortuary's warehouse. Christie's nightmares seem to come alive as she finds herself being stalked by a white faced ghoul in a black robe.",1412121600,,1657,4.444078947368421
