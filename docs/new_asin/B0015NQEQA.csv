8259224,3,B0015NQEQA,"As documentaries of the Gestapo go this is limited but seems fairly accurate.  However it is as much about the war as it is about the Gestapo so a real inside look at the Gestapo is not to be expected, only the outline of the Gestapo career during the war.  The speed and concentration of the narration and of the harsh images is a bit too bracing, and runs in the style of a propaganda film.  Maybe that's all right since the film is after all about the Gestapo, but it's a bit insulting to the intelligence that the storytelling itself is meant to be as menacing as the Gestapo were.  The chief problem is, as often with documentaries about the Nazis, the usage of, and coordination with, the music.  The choice of the operatic masterpieces by Richard Wagner is simply wacky - most of the time the love duet from Tristan and Isolde is the background for all kinds of terrible awful images and reportage.  The assumption seems to be that if it's by Wagner, it must be pro-Nazi; you aren't supposed to be able to tell the most conspicuous love music from a proper background score of the sicko police (does the term ""creep"" come from the Kripo?).  And you aren't supposed to know that Wagner's final work, Parsifal, was illegal from 1939 to the end of the war - rather a serious damper on the notion that Wagner was accepted by the Nazis as their prophet.

There is at least one error of fact: there were several more than seventeen in the dock at Nuernberg.",1325721600,,1458,4.414179104477612

8259226,4,B0015NQEQA,I was very impressed with this dvd set. It went into great detail to give the viewer an in-depth look into the era without getting too drawn out and losing the viewer's interest.  All 6 of the programs are excellent and I reccomend them to any person interested in how Nazi Germany came to be.,1277683200,,293,4.327272727272727
