8281407,4,B001B1UO8U,I purchased this video set to show at my son's 9th Birthday Party.  He and his buddies are into Goosebumps Books and I figured it would be a safe thing to view since different families have different limits on their movie ratings and finding something they have never seen would be tough.  We bought a used set and the case was a little banged up but the Discs were very clean and without scratches.  I realized that the orginal production dates were from the early 90's and the videos definitely showed the older technology but that didn't hinder the suspense or spook factor for our 8-9 year old audience.  They really enjoyed the videos.,1350345600,,640,4.587719298245614
