8405412,1,B003TRMLJY,"A hip-hop record company in Atlanta is going broke so they hire old school T. Eliot to take over the business end. Soon artists start to die and we are not shown the killers' face, but if you ever watched Scooby-Doo you can figure this one out, it was that bad. The movie also makes a criticism of Hip-Hop music in the beginning as all sounding the same with limited topics. It has burned itself out. The bad plot was topped with bad acting and bad music. And when I say bad, I don't mean good. No sex. No nudity. The F-bomb was dropped, but was used sparingly. I am not sure why someone would watch this film. There doesn't seem to be any attraction.",1304467200,,651,4.216
8405413,2,B003TRMLJY,"The Next Hit is a low budget pseudo noir flick about the rap record industry that was seeking...and apparently found DVD distribution.  I'm sure it's because of director Antwan Smith's connections to the hip hop industry, because it was not on the merit of this movie. The Next hit is a poorly written story about a record companies greed and how they manipulate the artists who make millions off of them.  Right off the bat, an idea that not too many can identify with. The zinger...or I guess what was supposed to be the interesting approach to the story is that the record industry is just as vile, violent and street thuggish as the so called talent that works for them. (And I make it sound better than it actually is...I don't know..I guess I write better than David Garwin.)
At this point in the review...I guess I should mention the actors.  Sadly this movie had almost no actors in it.  Most all of the players delivered their lines as cold as a corps.  No amount of screen time for any of them endeared them to me.  The cast as a whole was either miscast or completely talentless.  Fredro Starr and Lark Vorhies..the only members with a true ability to perform are out of sorts in this mess.  Their characters are the star crossed lovers...but it feels like another movie..and just doesn't work.  It's just bad. Overall the The Next Hit is disjointed and silly, and not in an enjoyable way.
This movie is shot with a digital camera, and it's almost as if the filmmaker did not understand the tool.  Scenes are usually very poorly lit.  The outside swing shots are some of the best looking but the repeated use of the theme is overbearing.  The editing is good but with the lopsided lighting...it does nothing to help the film.
In the end The Next Hit is just a visualization of the juvenile machismo driven lyrics in modern rap music.  They say Hip Hop is dead...and with disappointments like this it just might be victim to The Next Hit.",1287792000,2,1948,4.531428571428571
