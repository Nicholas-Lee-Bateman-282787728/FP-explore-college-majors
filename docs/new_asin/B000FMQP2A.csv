8124743,3,B000FMQP2A,"The scenes of the hospital JU-52 [Sanittsflugzeug] are stirring, all white with red crosses, not gray with black crosses.

They would pack the stretchers in tighter at Stalingrad. The Messerschmitt 321 glider ""Gigant,"" the second-largest aircraft built until that time, could carry twice its weight. It could carry 2 light tanks! The ""Troikaschlepp"" with 3 ME-110 fighters pulling it into the air, with the Gigant's 4 rocket pods belching smoke, looks as dangerous as it apparently was.

Hitler noted that the top of the ""impregnable"" fort Eben Emael looked like good glider landing paths. And so they did. General Student added dummy paratroopers to the landing force, and U.S forces copied this at Normandy.

The standout feature of this documentary is the JU-52 transport plane. I don't think those pilots had the safest job in the war. The stories of their landings in Crete is horrifying.

This film is full of authentic, quality, documentary footage.",1369526400,,956,5.148387096774194
8124744,4,B000FMQP2A,"The film footage contained on this DVD is what was shot for German WWII era newsreels. It primarily provides coverage of the main German transport aircraft, the JU 52 and the Gigant. About 35 minutes is dedicated to the JU52 with another 5 or 10 minutes on the Gigant. The footage of the JU 52 is quite good and shows the  aircraft in operations (both combat and non-combat) in many fronts and periods of the war. The footage of the Gigant and the huge glider it derived from is also quite impressive, showing not only operations but how these things were loaded, unloaded and how troops and equipment were stowed. There is also some coverage of other gliders and their operations (i.e., Crete, etc.). The DVD also provides quite a bit of historical information on the aircraft covered (i.e., historical development, strengths, weaknesses, etc.) delivered by a rather monotone English accent. The DVD is a bit disappointing, however, in that it provides no coverage whatsoever on reconnaissance aircraft and liason aircraft.",1263081600,,1024,4.988304093567251
8124745,3,B000FMQP2A,"This is the only DVD in this series (an excellent series, in my opinion) that has disappointed me.

It is entitled ""German Support Aircraft And Gliders"", but it seems to focus on the JU-52 and Gigant with a little coverage of gliders. I was hoping they would cover army cooperation and reconnaissance aircraft also such as the Fieseler Storch, the Focke Wulf 189 ""Owl"" and perhaps the long-range FW-200 ""Condor"" for example.

What the DVD covered, it covered well and if your interest lies primarily in the two aircraft mentioned, this DVD is for you. I understand that there is undoubtedly more archival footage for the Ju-52 and the Gigant available, so to a degree it is understandable.

Good DVD, but I was expecting a little more.",1245542400,,735,4.771653543307087
8124746,5,B000FMQP2A,"Very good information, history tracking, and keeps you locked on target. At the end wanting more, must see and get rest of collection.",1231718400,,134,4.869565217391305
