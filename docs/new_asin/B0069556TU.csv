4979486,5,B0069556TU,I wasn't sure what this dvd/bluray combo would have in store.  I watched Sign and played all the ps2 games..  I watched it and I was really tempted to break out the old PS2 and replay the original 4 games.  I really wish they would port those to the ps3.. maybe in HD.. Well back to the review.. The episodes felt short but got everything across to the viewer.  I guess I should watch the GU ova's now.,1332115200,,402,4.115384615384615
4979487,5,B0069556TU,"First time seeing this series and it was pleasant to watch, made me wanting to know what was going to happen in the next episode unlike most anime these days. Can't wait for the next episodes to be released.",1329696000,3,207,4.333333333333333
4979488,5,B0069556TU,"I was so hyped for the release of this DVD since it has been years since a .hack animation was released, and boy did this live up. The story is really cool, and the animation is just amazing. Along with that the special features are pretty neat and amusing to watch.

Story:

This is the first entry in the .hack animes to focus on the characters real life AND the game life at the same time, which is really cool to see since the games/manga/books have done this already. The students are new to the .hack franchise, but they use character modeled after Blackrose, Balmung and a Kite lookalike.

It takes place two years after the .hack//link game, and It seems that It may be setting up the .hack movie that just released in japan. The story was really cool and different than the previous .hack animes, so you won't see it copying from them.

Animation:

They did a wonderful job with the drawings in this anime. They were also all drawn by hand, instead of a computer, which makes you appreciate it even more. I watched the anime and special features on the DVD and I think they would look amazing on Blu-Ray.

Soundtrack:

Besides the story, I think the .hack universe needs to live up to its amazing soundtracks, and this one is no let down. It helps the flow of the story and you can make out slight nods to previous .hack music. The ending theme is pretty awesome as well.

Special Features:

Funimation included a ton of special features from the .hack versions of the DVD. The first set is ""Go, our Chim Chims!!"", which is in three parts (One for each episode). Its basically the .hack//gift - .hack//4KOMA of this era of .hack, but also explains some things from the anime you may have not picked up.

The next set they give you is three 15ish minute segments that range from cooking a hermit looking lunch, semi interview with the producer and lead animator (and has them doing flip drawings at an animators desk) and the final segment is focused on a quiz the Japanese release received (They tell you the questions in it though, so you could pause and answer them if you choose to. I was in the 7-9 range). All of them have Yui Ogura (Hermit Japanese voice) narrating/anchoring and they are pretty cool to watch, and I did find myself laughing at times.
They final set is a bunch of trailers for both the Japanese and English release of the DVD's, along with current Funimation releases.

Packaging:

It seems that anime releases that have Blu-Rays in them come in a regular Blu-Ray case, and a cardboard slip sleeve that is the length of DVD case, and has a cardboard bottom that the Blu-Ray can fit in. They did decide to make the case itself a ""recyclable"" case, but with the slip-sleeve it's not a big deal and is protected.
The DVD and Blu-Ray disc have the same look on them (title, background and Hermit) but it's in full color, and not cheaply made. On the back side of the paper insert has a poster like photo that you can see through the blu-ray inside.

Verdict:

I say buy this DVD right away, it may be only three episodes but it's the same length as any movie out there at the same price. For those that are new to the .hack Conglomerate will enjoy this OVA anime, and may even make you want to delve deeper into the huge universe .hack is. If you have watched the anime, played the games, read the books this anime has a TON of references in it that you will pick up and it's really cool seeing the easter eggs you can pick up.

( bought mine from Funimation for same price but came with that braclet.) The story is great and funny and if you play mmo's you can relate to what goes on in the world as you see the adventure through Tobias, Mary, and Sakuya. The price suxs though for just 75mins and 50mins of extras, but if your a .Dot Hack fan your gonna love it.",1329004800,8,508,4.09

Well written and with tight pacing, my only complaint is that we're not able to get inside the characters' heads that easily.  But if you're a fan of the franchise, this is a good addition and very much a fun romp back into the World.",1431734400,,384,4.162162162162162

4979516,4,B0069556TU,"This short series is definitely worth the money I paid to acquire this combo...I would recommend to anyone that has seen the original .hack, and to anyone that hasn't. Well animated, funny, and fun of all kinds of game references too boot. This series makes for a nice introduction to Anime as well (personal opinion here). Thank Amazon for having this series listed, it's always a pleasure to find what I am looking for, even when I just stumble upon it...LOL",1380153600,,460,4.691358024691358
4979517,4,B0069556TU,"Nice and cheaply priced when I purchased it, much cheaper then buying it from the Canadian Amazon site, even after paying exchange and import duties.  Only downside for me is not having seen any of the television series that preceded this collection made for a poor jumping on point for the .hack series.  Not that it was bad, but I would of like to of had a more in depth understanding of the series and how these OVA fit in to the overall story.  Still enjoyable none the less.",1377216000,,479,4.359550561797753
4979518,4,B0069556TU,"This anime wastes no time in filler, so every scene has a purpose of demonstrating some point about the character or environment. This leads to a fast ride, but the story is complete and says all that it wanted to say. Although I know some people leave wanting a little at the end, I'm glad for the realism it presents.
Quantum presents the characters quickly, but I ended up liking and respecting most of them fairly quickly, so it's not like this anime moves too quickly that you can't connect with the characters. It's been months since I have watched the anime for the second or third time, but some images remain stuck in my head, so it has some pretty memorable moments. It's not a 5 star because it didn't astound me, but I respect what it accomplished in such a short time.
It's a clean cut anime that takes you exactly where you need to go, but it doesn't leave you in the dust. A worthwhile watch.",1374969600,,907,4.372781065088757
4979519,5,B0069556TU,"I just finished watching this series and I have to say... It was just amazing.
I've been a .hack fan since the release of SIGN and the games and this is by far the best of the series despite it being an OVA.
As a fan I really enjoyed spotting all the cameos from characters from all series.
This is also a series you don't have to watch the previous shows to understand, and it will be just as good.
They did an amazing job with the animation it's bright, colorful, smooth, and when characters were far away they were done in simple CGI.
The soundtrack was great, it sounds similar to the style of Shadow of the Colossus but not as sad.
The voice acting was great! There was no crappy bored actors and they put alot of enthusiasm into it.
Although this series is the usual .hack story (comas, getting trapped in game, etc. etc.) it was done differently and pretty great IMO, I won't spoil it for you but you'll see what I'm talking about.
The reviews I read below really were the only reason I decided to watch this series, I was very skeptical at first glance when I saw they made the Balmung and Kite characters into female versions and I thought it was just going to be some near hentai goofy parody kind of like GIFT, but it was the complete opposite.
If you like action, this has a good dash of it plus the story is great I recommend this series to ANY anime fan, along with the .hack series (I suggest starting with SIGN then watching playthroughs of the original .hack games)
I really hope to see more series of the franchise like this, I'm definitely going to be watching this one again and again like I did with SIGN.",1374883200,2,1626,4.282467532467533
4979520,5,B0069556TU,"It was a shame this was so short, so much happens though, the animation was incredible! same ol story gimmicks, C.C.Corp is at it again involved with mysterious hospitalizations as always... but it is a new story based on all the other material.. a new .hack in its own right... as this is my absolute favorite series ever this does not disappoint in the continuation of my favorite anime series. A masterpiece to add to any fans collection and something amazing for newcomers.",1374796800,2,477,4.759036144578313

4979523,5,B0069556TU,"The animation is spectacular, the characters are fun and complex for only three episodes, and the story is well done. I was scared about getting another .hack after root, but this was definitely the best of the bunch.",1362960000,,217,4.7368421052631575
4979524,5,B0069556TU,"I wanna be honest here. when i first seen this set i was EXTEMELY hesitant on getting it because of the length of it even with all its little extas. however, i must say i couldn't be happier! this OVA set is actually quite entertaining and each of the episodes has a lot going on in it. the Animation is quite beautiful i think & i don't really have any complaints with the english cast & the musical score is also pretty good IMO.

 if i had to pick a favorite character in the series
i would say it is Hermit. he almost reminds me of Macha from .hack//SIGN in a way.

so if you are a fan of anything .hack related i would recommend to pick it up. especially at the price it is now compared to almost $30 bux",1361404800,,709,4.01418439716312

It's a great short series within itself, but also a wonderful addition to the existing line of .hack out there.  If you're an anime fan, or a MMO fan, or just like a really well made show, then you'll like .hack//Quantum.

4979528,5,B0069556TU,"I purchased this wonderful OVA about 4 days ago and couldn't have been any more excited when it got here. It's a .Hack OVA so the given is if you don't like the .Hack series, or are looking for a complete series to get into, this isn't for you. The quality of the animations are great, there are a nice bit of extra's to keep people busy.

8495047,5,B0069556TU,".hack//SIGN was one of the original anime series that really hooked me into anime for good way back when. I used to stay up super late and make sure I watched at least it, and then after it quit airing, all of the prequels as well. I played every game and loved them equally. That said, this DVD collection is amazing. Granted, I already had all of it before, but having it condensed to one case is great for fans and new comers alike.

Trilogy: Movie</a>&nbsp;was downright confusing.  However, .hack//Quantum finally showed what this concept could be.

Basically, three high school girlfriends, Tobias, Mary, and Sakuya, are truly into the game, but a chance encounter with the mysterious Hermit character brings our friends into Yet Another encounter with this MMORPG's mysterious pattern of Lost Ones, players who fall into irreversible comas, and causes one of the three to do just that.  While the other two are desperately trying to save their friend, they uncover the latest conspiracy involving hundreds of comatose players and find themselves working uneasily with the people tasked with sorting out this ""bug"".  Everything comes to a head in a surprise filled climax.

This series comes with a number of features that make it stand out above all the older versions I've seen: spectacular graphics, a good mix of online/offline events, and, to my surprise, the best explanation for all that has gone on before that I've seen yet.  Perhaps the anime at least came out a decade or two too soon.

Note: In all my experience with Funimation Blu-ray/DVD sets, I've never seen one with so little difference between the DVD and Blu-ray editions, identical color picture with just a slight background color variation and a difference in the tiny ""DVD EDITION"" or ""BLU-RAY EDITION"" labeling; perhaps this is why I had to return the first one I purchased for having two DVD editions in a plastic sealed package!
