2414011,1,B000BD1LG8,"Nowhere on the product description did it mention the content enclosed in the gift set, leading me to believe it was new or unique material. Unfortunately, it is 4 DVDs, one for each comic, 2 of which I already owned.

Enlosed is

White:Tater Salad

Cable Guy:Git-r-Done

Foxworthy-Redneck

Engvall:Here's your sign",1134345600,129,315,5.22

8085248,4,B000BD1LG8,"I got this to have something of theirs that was older than the ones I am watching on TV right now.  I wanted a variety, and I have seen the Blue Collar alot, they are popular and I can watch them most any time you turn on the TV.  This is a nice box set to have.  I just love the way each of them have their own way of making you laugh and most all the time the whole family can watch with no problem.  I love them all!",1247616000,,419,3.6222222222222222
8085249,4,B000BD1LG8,Really good stuff in here. Larry's bit is probably the funniest. Now I can see how the Blue Collar tours really got going.,1242518400,2,122,4.3478260869565215
8085250,5,B000BD1LG8,"""You might have a great time if..."" you buy this collection! For guys who are constantly grouped together, these four have surprisingly different comedy styles. Foxworthy and Engvall are more PG variety, while the coarser Ron White is more the FU variety, and Larry the Cable Guy is simply off the meter. If you like some good quick-witted stand-up, this collection is for you.",1229040000,4,377,4.90625
