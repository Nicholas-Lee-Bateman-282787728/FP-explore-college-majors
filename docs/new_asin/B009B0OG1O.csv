5311991,5,B009B0OG1O,"Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite Directors ever. I love most of his films, but I have never seen ""Jackie Brown"". I want to respond to the people who have reviewed this already. These are films Tarantino choose that have made his carree, sure he didn't write ""True Romance"", but that is what launched him into the spotlight and got him into ""Reservor Dogs"", the film is significant to him in his carrer, and so are all the ones that he then Directed. I don't own all his movies on blu ray, I own ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Death Proof"", and ""Kill Bill"", but one: this box set comes with  two bonus discs of special features with Tarantino, so that is one thing to really anticipate as a big fan of his; 2: The ""Kill Bill"" movies that you can already find on blu ray are shit, might as well have kept the DVDs, the movies are amazing, the blu ray wasn't to it's full quality as ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Death Proof"", so maybe they will improve on that and add actual features and commentary to the ""Kill Bill"" films that we never saw on the dvd or blu ray before, if they don't, well I can live with that. And plus, this boxset looks amazing and is something that I want as a blu ray movie collector. So don't give this a bad review just because you own the blu rays already, review the product. And all you all know you are going to get this because of how awesome it looks.",1348099200,4,1364,4.206106870229007
5311992,5,B009B0OG1O,"How can people be negative of something not yet released.  This is a collection for those who don't own Tarantino's films on Blu-Ray.  Myself included.

I can hardly wait.",1348099200,9,171,4.827586206896552
5311993,3,B009B0OG1O,"I have all the movies on Blu Ray already, well all but Kill Bill 1 & 2, which begs the question:  Whatever happened to The Whole Bloody Affair???  Release something worthwhile please...",1348099200,12,185,4.75
5311994,3,B009B0OG1O,"Quentin's certainly one of a kind, and Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown show him at the top of his game.

However, the Box Set is quite pricey. You'd probably get all the movies cheaper if you buy them individually.

Please note: Although 'True Romance' was written by QT, it was directed by the late Tony Scott.",1348099200,5,307,4.464285714285714

5312015,5,B009B0OG1O,"This is definitely the set for you if you are a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. Comes with all of his best movies (in my honest opinon) as well as some special features.

So many movies that you can definitely have a Tarantino marathon and well worth the price. Just wish that it came with Django Unchained as well.

I had no issues with this box set at all. It was excellent!

5312039,4,B009B0OG1O,"First off, Tarantino's films are excellent and should be watched by any lover of film. However, If you already own a few of his movies on DVD or Blu-ray then I would not necessarily recommend buying this set. The only film with a commentary track seems to be True Romance, and I was disappointed to see that Reservoir Dogs from this set has significantly less special features than my 10th anniversary edition DVD of it. The two bonus disks in this set do have hours of features, but it's mostly critics or people vaguely associated with a film talking. Rarely is Tarantino or any member of the films shown giving their input. The artwork on the box and dvds is quite excellent, and I can probably say that it's one of the contributing reasons of my decision to purchase this box set. The box itself, however, is pretty flimsy, and mine came delivered in a pre-beaten up condition. There were plenty of scratches, dents, and one of the disk holders was cracked pretty bad.

Final verdict: If you don't own any of his films, and/or you mainly want this for collection reasons then go for it, but if you are looking for extra features and commentaries to set it apart from the previous DVD releases, then you are out of luck.",1413072000,20,1223,4.53393665158371

5312045,1,B009B0OG1O,"Kill Bill is awful.
The other movies can be gotten for ""cheap"" so save your money and avoid Kill Bill.
Pure insult to intelligence. It's just a test to see if you ""like something"" because it's in a set, but it really stinks.
Just because QT ""made it"" doesn't mean it's good( or even poor.. but rotten).
Like most of the rest though.",1405900800,2,332,4.285714285714286

5312047,4,B009B0OG1O,"Everything described is included, and it looks great. However, the cardboard slip cover is rather flimsy, as is the spindle casing holding the discs. This must be handled with tender care if it's going to last.",1402272000,,210,4.861111111111111

5312049,5,B009B0OG1O,"Has the best of his movies and a TON of extra stuff. Totally worth the buy. The art inside is awesome, it's a very good looking case. Though I'm not sure why they designed the cover so that the case that holds the discs goes in from the bottom (which means when you hold the box set, it tends to slip out) but that's my only concern. I don't want someone to pick it up to look at it and have the case slip from the sleeve and break. Cuz then I might go all Tarantino on them!",1400976000,,475,3.857142857142857

5312052,3,B009B0OG1O,"I strongly believe that QT is one of the greatest living writer/director of our time. And will go down in history as the same. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic package but desperately needs a price drop to 49.99$. No joke.",1395964800,,223,4.6
5312053,3,B009B0OG1O,"This is clearly an excellent product both visually and in terms of content. BUT living in France, the box arrived in a very bad shape, as if it was a second hand copy, which is very disapointing since there's no way I can send it back.

Last time I buy this kind of product from amazon.com, they don't wrap those well enough...",1395360000,,327,4.274193548387097

5312056,5,B009B0OG1O,"I purchased this not even knowing that Tarantino wrote all of these movies. If you love these movies and have a blu-ray player then I assure you your money will not be wasted. The blu-ray discs guarantee at least a 10year insurance policy at minimum if taken care of. all in all I waited for the price to drop, and it did so the value is worth the price. enjoy post modern cinema.",1390521600,,380,4.219178082191781
5312057,4,B009B0OG1O,"This is an awesome collection of Tarantino's films and they look great on blu-ray.  The only complaints I have are the packaging which is somewhat cheap.  The way the packaging/cover is setup, you have the pull the collection out from the bottom of the case and it becomes tough to get the movies back in when you are done selecting the film you want to watch.  The other issue (and this is somewhat small) is that they released the collection just before ""Django Unchained"" was released.  I understand it was a business move so that people would buy ""Django"" separately if they really wanted a complete collection but it would have still been nice for them to wait for ""Django"" to be released and made a part of the total collection.  Overall, it is a great collection and Taratino is up there with Scorsese as one of my all-time favorite filmmakers.",1388707200,,851,4.6092715231788075
5312058,5,B009B0OG1O,"I bought this collection for my husband who is a HUGE Tarantino fan. The Blue Ray quality is amazing and it doesn't disappoint. We own all the films on DVD, but I couldn't pass up such an elite collection of my favorites. The only one missing was ""Four Rooms"", which he directed one short story in a collection of four. I would love to have that on Blu-Ray, but its a rare find on regular DVD. LOVE THIS COLLECTION!!",1388188800,,416,4.2784810126582276
5312059,5,B009B0OG1O,"Not only do all of Tarantino's movies look amazing in Blu-ray, the case for this collection really pulls it all together. The artwork that lines the inside and outside of the box is wonderful, and really complements his movie style. Plus, there's a TON of extra footage- from each individual movie disc and also from two special features discs

If you're a fan of Tarantino then this collection is a must-have!",1388188800,,410,4.774647887323944

All in gorgeous Bluray. with a seriously wickedly awesome package plus a TON of extra content.
The box art alone is fantastic. Wait til you dig into the movies.....
This is a must own.

[Next up for me, personally, the Coen brothers collection(s)]",1388016000,,366,5.1
5312061,4,B009B0OG1O,"Having the movies in blu-ray is almost a dream, whatcing them all over again is part of this dream
The reason for the 4 out of 5 is because the actual Bonus material es basically interviews for other people than Tarantino, he barely shows in a section in bonus disc 2 theferore even if they are talking about the movies is just a whisper of others talking about his life, his proyects, not himself",1385942400,,397,4.378378378378378

Not only watching the other films for the first time, like Death Proof, on blu-ray have been the best treat of my life but re-watching my favorites in stunning blu-ray is something grand and I'm glad I'm able to have this and watch it whenever I want.

It includes all of Quentin Tarantino's movies, even True Romance, which he didn't actually direct but wrote. Each of the disks come with all of their individual extras, special features, etc.. The box art is beautiful, with artworks and dialogues from the films. The price is a steal, considering if you bought all of the movies on Blu-ray individually you would spend $10-$15 for each. Plus it comes with 2 bonus discs. The Blu-ray definition is beautiful and clear.

We get two huge documentaries done right and some previously released extras for all the films. Tarantino has had many DVD and Blu-ray collections. This is the deluxe version. Overall, the picture quality is good, HD extras are great and the sound is amazing for all the films (except True Romance). Many of the extras from the DVD releases are included in this Blu-ray collection but not all. Forget about director's commentaries because Tarantino doesn't do them for his films (except True Romance which is here but he wrote that instead of directed). Tony Scott directed True Romance with a great cast so it's a bonus anyway. Sin City isn't here. My only complaint is that the packaging and casing are average. Considering the hefty new material in HD it is worth the price.

Buy this collection! It has an amazing 5-star rating on Amazon. Tarantino is the perfect person to get a deluxe Blu-ray package. All of the films are worth watching. If you like even half of the films and don't own all the Blu-rays yet this is a good purchase.",1377561600,2,1176,4.681159420289855

The special features are alright (each disc includes everything included on the individual releases - plus two bonus disc which are exhaustively compiled docu-goodies).  If you have all or most of these, don't bother getting the set (there's not enough new here to justify it), but if you're like me and have been waiting to upgrade your Tarantino collection to Blu, I say do it!  Do it fast and do it loud! (Yeah there's no Natural Born Killers or Four Rooms or From Dusk 'Til Dawn, but that's just nitpickery.

I love all of the films in here and to have them all in the incredibly cool looking set (look at that artwork) makes me very happy. All of the films look amazing in 1080p and the sound is great.

The special features were very enjoyable and of course the films are phenomenal. The only complaint I have isn't even really a complaint. I am just bewildered by the inclusion of True Romance in the set. True Romance is a solid film for sure, but not great. If a film had to be included that Tarantino wrote and didn't direct why not Natural Born killers? Honestly I just dislike Tony Scott and find Oliver Stone's Natural Born killers to be a more worthy inclusion; after-all the man is just a far less spectacular Tarantino clone. Or perhaps the best route would have been to wait on the video release of Django Unchained. But rambling aside, this is a great buy and any fan of Quentin Tarantino or great films should certainly look into this set.",1357171200,,911,4.527272727272727

5312156,5,B009B0OG1O,"Quentin Tarantino is probably the most visceral director of the 20th century and beyond. In 20 years, the 'XX' this box set is celebrating, the man only did 6 completely independent movies all written and directed (sometimes starred in) by himself. After writing and successfully selling his first 2 screenplays (True Romance which is included in this collection and Natural Born Killers which after produced he disowned) he was able to move up.

The first project he got to do on his own was Res Dogs, a gritty tough guy movie about a jewel heist which we never see. The second and probably most famous and greatest movie he directed was Pulp Fiction. Next came his first shot at a modern day 'blaxploitation' film called Jackie Brown written after the novel 'Rum Punch. After a much deserved 6 year hiatus Tarantino unleashes to the world, an idea that was born on the Pulp Fiction set, my personal favorite Kill Bill. Kill Bill is a samurai meets kung fu epic.

Although split up into 2 volumes it is really only 1 film making that his 4th movie. Tarantino's next project is with buddy Robert Rodriguez in the double feature Grindhouse, called Death Proof. This movie Quentin calls his 'worst film'. Not a bad movie, so if thats the worst he's got, thats pretty good. Although the Death Proof portion of Grindhouse was completely his own, because it was a joint venture with RR I did not count it as number 5. Finally number 5 is Inglourious Basterds. A WWII movie that he had been wanting to do for years, coming to the screen and sacrificing nothing.

Whats not included in this collection is Django Unchained (2012) his sixth film, as the movie was released after the collection. Needless to say Tarantino is very picky with his projects, he writes each script masterfully and makes sure you see things in his films that you will not see anywhere else.",1356912000,4,1858,4.675840978593272

5312164,3,B009B0OG1O,"This is an amazing set of movies from an amazing filmmaker, and on Blu Ray non the less! I was, however, VERY unimpressed with the quality and design of the packaging. The box that holds all of the disks is quite flimsy. It is easy to bend, and could also rip without too much effort. The disk insert itself is also quite flimsy, and comes out from the BOTTOM of the box, not the side like most other collections. This may be an issue if you plan on keeping this on a shelf. Someone may take this off the shelf and the entire collections of disks will come out from the bottom if you aren't ready to catch them. The inner sleeve comes out with no effort at all. The artwork and graphic design included on the packaging is very awesome which is a plus. Perhaps they had to use such cheap materials to keep the cost low on a 10 disk Blu Ray set? I don't see an excuse for the opening to be on the bottom, though. That is just poor design. I have made a strap to go around the outside of the box to keep the inner sleeve from coming right out any time this collection is picked up. If you can get past the materials used and poor design of the packaging, this is a MUST HAVE collection for any Tarantino fan!",1356480000,36,1205,4.0886075949367084

5312168,5,B009B0OG1O,"How may we begin to praise this director?  Perhaps, history may bow prostate as our guide.  Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch,"" et al) was once called ""the Picasso of Violence.""  Let us grade up the clip, as it were, to pronounce definitively that Quentin Tarantino has surely surpassed the elder director, and now belongs to the ages, all ages, regardless of age, race, or ethnicity.  Whereas Picasso was a hack, obviously painting for remuneration, Neiman was a true artist.  ""Guernica,"" awkward, uncomfortable.  ""Ali,""  pure glory, a black man unchained.  You cannot discern faces in a Picasso.  Just who is whom?  But in a Neiman, the blaze of identity shines forth in its incandescent multitude, even when portraying diminutive horse jockeys.  Did Picasso ever paint a Kentucky Derby mural?  I think not!

No film maker should enjoy, no more deserves, his NRA Trophy of Merit than Mr. Tarantino.  He has put on, no, glorified!  more gun masters of craft than any organization in the history of this Republic.  God Bless Quentin Tarantino, and God Bless America.

Absolutely love it all.
I've read quite a few reviewers trying to understand why True Romance is included when Mr. Tarantino only wrote this. Then why not include From Dusk Till Dawn or Natural Born Killers because he wrote those as well. If you read up on a lot of his movies are within the same universe. ""John Travolta's Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction is the brother of Michael Madsen's Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs, Harvey Keitel's Mr. White worked with Alabama from True Romance, the plot basis for Kill Bill is described as the synopsis for a TV series (basically Fox Force Five, right on down to Mia Wallace playing the title role) in Pulp Fiction, etc. Now the epiphany that Eli Roth's character of Donny Donowitz aka ""The Bear Jew"" in Inglourious Basterds is the father of the movie producer Lee Donowitz in True Romance has inspired a truly mind-blowing theory that the rest of the films (chronologically speaking) in Tarantino's filmography..."" The other movies he has written do not truly fit within the ""universe"" Mr. Tarantino has created.
All in all, this is an amazing, must have collection to pick up.",1353801600,105,1378,4.674897119341564

5312178,5,B009B0OG1O,"...still no ""Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair"". Both films cut together as one as it was intended, I thought we'd finally get a US release in this set. I guess I still have to settle for my DVD import",1353283200,19,202,4.075
5312179,5,B009B0OG1O,"These are 8 of the best films which have changed the landscape of cinema over the last 20 years. True, a few other films in which Tarantino has been involved with (FOUR ROOMS, FROM DUSK TIL DAWN, etc.) have been excluded (...didn't he write NATURAL BORN KILLERS???). While all of the interviews and documentaries are worth taking a look at, really the only way I would have sold the individual blu-rays I already own is if this new box set contained digital copies of the films...as I would highly be enthused to have PULP FICTION and RESERVOIR DOGS on my iPod :)",1352851200,3,563,4.529411764705882
5312180,3,B009B0OG1O,"Wow. People who are saying this should include Killing Zoe, and Planet terror, From Dusk Til Dawn, and yadda yadda yadda... This is a box set of Tarantino films. Not Robert Rodriguez or Roger Avary. Tarantino basically had nothing to do with Killing Zoe except maybe executive producer. Even True Romance wasn't directed by Tarantino so i don't understand why that one is in there (even though i DO love the film and yes i'm aware he wrote it). Four Rooms he only directed 1 segement. So anyway, quit complaining people...this is TARANTINO's set and no one else's.",1351900800,9,564,4.76530612244898
5312181,5,B009B0OG1O,"For anyone new to Tarantino, you are in for a real treat!  These 8 movies will have you thinking long after the credits roll.  Watch Kill Bill vol. 1 and 2 back to back.  I think they should have included From Dusk til Dawn and Four Rooms also. Those two plus Killing Zoe would have made it complete.  Well worth the purchase if you don't already own them on Blu-ray.",1350432000,5,367,4.2

thanks
Tarantino you rule",1349740800,,121,3.88
5312183,5,B009B0OG1O,"As some others have said and as I suspect of any true Tarantino fan, I already own all of these movies and more of Quentin's on Blu-ray so I can't say I'll be making this purchase.  However, I have been happy with all of the films in this collection in terms of HD audio/picture quality, so I can highly recommend this collection which has been sweetened with extras.  If I read a professional review at [...] and they say that the audio and picture quality has been enhanced, I may sell my individual discs and snag this collection.  One thing to note, I understand that Rodriguez directed Planet Terror, but it should be part of the collection if Death Proof is included to complete the Grindhouse experience.",1348272000,12,711,4.582677165354331
5312184,5,B009B0OG1O,"If you're a real fan of Tarantino or are a true film maker, this set is worth buying for the special features. Directors like Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino know what it means to double dip their fans, so they always deliver on worth while bonus features.",1348272000,5,268,4.604166666666667
5312185,5,B009B0OG1O,"It is a bit disappointing that there is no ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""  I checked to see if it is only movies he directed, since he didn't direct that one, but it isn't.  Tarantino wrote ""True Romance,"" just like he wrote ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" but didn't direct either of them.  I own most of these on Blu-ray already so I guess I won't be purchasing it, but if I didn't own any of these, I would definitely buy it.  I recommend this to all Tarantino fans.",1348185600,3,452,4.160919540229885

8538980,5,B009B0OG1O,"My husband is a fan of Quentin Tarantino. I bought him the Tarantino XX: 8-Film Collection as a gift for our anniversary on a Lightning Deal on Amazon Prime Day. The price was unbeatable (45% off of retail). It worked out to just under $7 per Blu-Ray disc. This would have been a fantastic price for DVDs, but I was shocked to find it for the Blu-Rays. The collection includes 8 of Tarantino's titles: Reservoir Dogs, True Romance, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Kill Bill: Vol. 2, Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds. The set also includes two discs of bonus footage and interviews. This is a great gift for any Tarantino fan, even at regular price. It certainly beats buying the movies individually.

I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the ""helpful"" button!",1472169600,,814,4.732394366197183
8538981,3,B009B0OG1O,"Judging the set for its content - this is a four star set. All the films are great, and the Blu-ray editions are solid. The older HD transfers aren't going to blow you away at this point, but they are still the best available versions.

The set features some great films and beautiful artwork, unfortunately marred by the cheapness of the set's manufacturing. It just feels cheap. The outer paper sleeve is thin and easily chipped - mine arrived brand new but already splitting on all four edges. The inside foldout packaging is flimsy and unwieldy, again suffering from the cheapness of the paper.

If you already own these movies on Blu-ray, as I did, I have to say the set is unfortunately not worth the upgrade - it's not the deluxe set the films (or the beautiful Mondo artwork) deserve.",1468972800,,792,4.609929078014185
