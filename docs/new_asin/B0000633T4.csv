1687430,5,B0000633T4,"This DVD documents the preparation and performance of Dave Brubeck's jazz mass, ""To Hope - A Celebration"". It was recorded in Moscow in 1997 with Russian Orchestra and Chorus and is an absolute masterpiece! Dave performs with Jack Six, Randy Jones, Bobby Militello and conductor Russell Gloyd. The leadup to the performance is quite interesting as it shows Russell teaching the Russian performers to sing in English and play in jazz tempo. The production, clarity and camera work are superb and the performance of ""Blue Rhondo ala Turk"" with quartet and orchestra is outstanding. The 14th movement of the 15 part mass will have you cheering in your living room.",1030838400,8,661,5.0181818181818185

7958436,5,B0000633T4,A great remembrance of the talent of this great composer/musician.  The mass is performed by a wonderful orchestra and choir with punctuation by the quartet.  Saw a bi of it on YouTube and had to get it.  A worthwhile addition to a library of great American music.  Right there with Ellington.,1359849600,,293,4.686274509803922
7958437,1,B0000633T4,"The sound is very low, even with the tv turned up at top volume.  I bought it for my husband, who is 94, loves Jazz, and the only thing he does is listen to music all day.  He had trouble hearing it and then I listened to it also and the sound is not great.",1358208000,3,257,3.6545454545454548
7958438,5,B0000633T4,"Ever sincce I was able to find this extraordinary DVD I jubilate every time I find it again through de services of amazon.com somewhere I can buy it. It has given many wonderful moments because it is a most exceptinal event in the life of this great composer and musician and the joy to play his wonderful Mass he has composed in Moscow how in enjoy when all the artists share in that joy. It is really as Bob Mititello, the saxophonist says : ""His solos are from that other world ! Thanks for the excellent service in sending me this DVD very promptly. viktor.hof@vtxmail.ch",1322870400,,575,4.485714285714286
7958439,2,B0000633T4,"Dave Brubeck is a great jazz piano player and he shows it by improvising on a Russian theme during an interview (one of the best moments, or minutes).

Usually we see the concert and then can see complementary information in the ""extras"".
In this case we see the extras and have a complementary show at the end...
We see his arrival, his interviews, his rehearsals, meetings, etc... and when you are about to throw yourself out of the window you are rewarded with a few minutes of great music.",1199404800,2,493,4.53932584269663
7958440,5,B0000633T4,"Dave has set the bar very high for so many years.  He does not have an equal,IMO. I have most of his albums in vinyl and disc and several DVD's, and I am completely taken back each time I listen to him. Way to go, Dave.",1193184000,,219,3.760869565217391
7958441,5,B0000633T4,"I own the DVD of this and enjoy it so much I bought the VHS for my parents.  Everyone knows Take Five but Brubeck's sacred music, specifically this Mass, was an area unknown to me prior to a Houston concert in Dec.'06.  This recording is interesting and entertaining because it leads up to the actual concert with backstage interviews and rehearsal footage in Russia.  The soprano is especially noteworthy, as was an impromptu jam session with a violinist which had Dave beaming from ear to ear with joy.  The songs generally start off slow and operatic; but before you know it, the quartet and the orchestra join in and jazz it up in typical Brubeck style.  My favorite is 'All My Hope'; the melody stays with me all day!",1169078400,5,722,4.565891472868217
7958442,3,B0000633T4,"Over the past couple of years, I've become a great fan of Dave Brubeck's music and found this DVD (I'm surprised he even had one) to be a good look at a behind the scenes tour of Dave in Moscow playing with the Russian National Orchestra.  The behind the scenes material is great, by far the best part of the DVD.  You'll see a legendary jazz man in his element, soaking up his host's adulation.  The performance of Blue Rondo Ala Turk is another highlight well worth the price of this DVD alone.  My only regret is that much of the second half of this DVD centers around Dave's choral music which, to me, is too operatic and not the orchestrated jazz that made Dave's music an important part of my listening experience over the last couple of years.
I recently saw the Dave Brubeck Quartet in concert with the Russian National Orchestra at the Ironstone Vineyard in Murphys, California (July 2002).  It was the best concert I have ever attended.  Really, and I've seen a lot of acts in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe.  It was as if an orchestra/big band showed up in your backyard and played for you and your friends.  Totally cool, totally sophisticated, played by consumate professional musicians that know their instruments inside and out.  This was not a modern concert of this week's star cursing at the audience and calling it art.  You really sense the music resonates to the core of each individual in the Quartet and the orchestra, playing it with such skill, knowledge, and insight on so many levels that it sends chills through your body.  I don't know how many times I said to myself during this concert, ""Man, these guys are good.""  The Ironstone concert started with the Russian National Orchestra opening with Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, making way for the Dave Brubeck Quartet's entrance as these grey beard's kicked it up a gear and the whole place began to swing.  Backed by the orchestra, the Dave Brubeck Quartet dug into Summer Music, Salute to the Count, Take Five, Take the A Train, and Blue Rondo Ala Turk.  I would kill to have this concert or a similar concert on DVD and only hope that it will be produced, a great jazz man working with the material that made him famous, backed by a full orchestra (I highly recommend Dave Brubeck's 80th Birthday CD with the London Symphony Orchestra, which captures much of the concert I describe above).  Until that happens, and I really, really hope Dave's production people are working at putting a DVD like this together, Dave Brubeck in Moscow is a good bet for the backstage scenes and Blue Rondo Ala Turk.  It will give you a good sense of the decency of this man and a measure of the timeless music he makes.",1032134400,8,2675,4.564853556485356
