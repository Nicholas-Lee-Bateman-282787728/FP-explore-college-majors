8425020,5,B004D9DKEM,I loved this movie; it's kind of a comic tragedy.  Colors and images are amazing.  Worth watching multiple times.  Only drawback is the English subtitles are hard to read.,1354406400,,171,4.827586206896552
8425021,5,B004D9DKEM,"They don't make movies like this in Hollywood. Period. Tears for Sale a.k.a Charleston & Vendetta is an attractive, dynamic, feminine, adventure-comedy for intelligent audience. Its a surrealist film that makes you dream about another world that although fascinating, is not necessarily better than our world. This is high-end intelligent cinema at its best. Critics are split on this movie. If you need a believable story line, go to your multiplex and watch Mission Impossible 6. However if you want to be captivated by beautiful images, incredible actresses, a fantastic story and magical illogic of it all, this is the movie for you. As far as this DVD goes, its pretty good. Nice anamorphic widescreen transfer. Played fine in my USA player",1294617600,,745,5.114754098360656
