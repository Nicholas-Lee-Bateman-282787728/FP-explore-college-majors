As I enjoy my television set only because it allows me to watch movies I've carefully chosen on the web, I haven't had the opportunity until now to discover POSITIVE I.D., a movie written, produced and directed by Andy Anderson. So, one more time, thank you Anchor Bay for releasing movies that don't match the usual criteria of Hollywood moghuls.
POSITIVE I.D. owes a lot to Stephanie Rascoe who plays the characters of Julie Kenner and Bobbie King. She is simply outstanding, giving a tremendous reality to Julie, a 30 years old woman trying to recover from the trauma of an assault. She doesn't speak a lot but we feel how she is suffering while her husband and her children are slowly disappearing from her life. One could say that the plot is somewhat evident because the director never fools us by letting us believe that Julie is suffering from a schizophrenia that forces her to become Bobbie King, a gorgeous young woman from Florida, when she leaves home. We understand that, if she frequents the dangerous downtown streets of Dallas, it's for an evident reason I won't spoil here. No, Andy Anderson is smarter than that and the final twist of POSITIVE I.D. leaves us with the need to watch again the movie from a different perspective. From Julie's perspective.
Only a trailer as bonus feature, video and sound no more than average.
A DVD zone discovery.",1014681600,14,1537,4.696296296296296
7898460,4,6305971870,"Positive I.D. - a tantalisingly short title and so succinctly to the point that is itself an apposite desciption of the film and what it has to offer. The title alone seems to challenge the potential viewer. This is not major  cinema but in its way certainly a masterpiece. The brilliantly crafted  direction leads the viewer through the film's tortuous path towards its  conclusion, giving just enough of a lead to show which way to step next,  but not enough to for you to know quite where, like a master chess player  against an amateur. The plot remains tight and focussed throughout, hardly  a sentence wasted, let alone a scene, as each is like  cue for the next. I  was absorbed as I watched the main character awkardly struggle from the  depth of fear and self-pity to regain her feet, then walk, then function,  and eventually dominate the theatre she constructs from the lives of the  characters around her. Slow moving at first, the pace steadily hots up ....",961977600,4,970,4.680473372781065
7898461,4,6305971870,"I am not gonna lie and say the movie is the best thing you will ever see...but if you are interested in independent film then this is a must see. Filmed on a very low budget ( check out the credits at the end of the  film ), this 1987 release was on many a film critics 10 Best list, mainly,  in my opinion, due to Stephanie Rascoes performance as a rape victim who  assumes another identity. This is basically one of those movies where you  have no clue whats going on until the final ten minutes of the film...and  when it all comes together you are FLOORED. Andy Anderson does a great job  directing and writing and adds a few touches of humor to lighten things  up. I originally caught this film on cable and never forgot it. Although the  price is high, i would reccomend trying one of the auction sites( which is  what I did)and buying it. Like I said earlier, if you like good independent  films ( and remember, in 1987 independent films were far less common that  they are now, especially in wide release) then I would definitely reccomend  this film.",957744000,8,1059,4.346938775510204
