8411800,5,B003F0RSK2,"This film is about Rebiya Kadeer and the plight of her people in China. I just watched a screening with a Q&A with Jeff Daniels, the director.

Summary of film: Rebiya Kadeer spent six years in a Chinese prison before being exiled to Washington DC. An tireless advocate for the independence of her oil-rich Uyghur homeland - known as East Turkestan - she has been punished at every turn by the Chinese authorities, who have now condemned two of her sons to lengthy prison sentences.

Rising from obscurity and poverty to become the seventh richest person in China and two-time Nobel Prize-nominee, Kadeer is an extraordinary woman driven by a fierce commitment to her cause.

Australian filmmaker Jeff Daniels follows Kadeer in her relentless campaign for her people's autonomy, documenting the life of a fearless woman who has paid a terrible price for becoming an international symbol of her nation's struggle.

My review: An intense account of the life of a most impressive women. Her story is always powerful, often tragic and sometimes quite humorous. I believe that this film is important for understanding the delicate and often dangerous geo-politics of Central Asia. Only about an hour long, this film is significant, enjoyable and ultimately worth while.
