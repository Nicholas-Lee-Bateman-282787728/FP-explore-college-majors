8239643,4,B0010ZH68I,"The Four Corner Survival Match (Colt Cabana vs. Jonny Storm vs. Matt Sydal vs. Spud) was a fun spotty mess to start the show and got the crowd all fired up. The Jimmy Rave-Davey Richards match was solid with even with the goofs. The Claudio Castagnoli-BJ Whitmer match had a brawl on the floor was dull but the final stretch in the ring was solid back-and-forth action. The Colt Cabana-Chris Hero match was a very paint by the numbers match from two wrestlers familiar with each other. The Doug Williams & Jody Fleisch-SUWA & Go Shiozaki-tag team match was not great but pretty good. The FWA Heavyweight Title Match between Robbie Brookside & Chad Collyer was fine but the ROH fans couldn't care less about said bout. The ROH World Tag Team Title Match between Austin Aries & Roderick Strong against Jay & Mark Briscoe was a awesome,hard-hitting,back-and-forth bout and the same goes for the The World & Pure Title Unification Match between Bryan Danielson & Nigel McGuinness. I give this card a 8 out of 10.",1423958400,,1008,4.700564971751413
