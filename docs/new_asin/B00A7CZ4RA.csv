8547784,2,B00A7CZ4RA,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.  Although the routine seemed good from what  I could see of it, I didn't like the blackness of the picture and the many candles in the background which I found very distracting.  The person doing the poses also wore a dark colour so I had a hard time seeing the poses.  I saw her hands and feet and head but had difficulty seeing the rest of her body so it was hard to see her move into the pose.  The instructions were fairly clear and the person providing the instruction had a very soothing voice but I needed a visual.  I would have preferred a lighter background and don't understand why they  produced such a dark video. I have several yoga DVDs and all of them present their yoga routine in a light background.",1501891200,3,756,4.319148936170213

8547787,5,B00A7CZ4RA,I have been using this dvd for a few years now and I recently lent it to a friend. She loved it so I told her to keep it and I bought another one. The piano music in the background is beautiful and peaceful and the instructors voice is soothing and gentle. I bought others from them as well. I've been shy about using yoga for religious reasons but after doing some research and using the videos I am very grateful to these women for putting together such a precious routine. It is very prayerful and Christ focused. Great for new to intermediate levels.,1455580800,10,554,4.336538461538462

8547789,5,B00A7CZ4RA,"I have two dogs and two puppies running around my house all the time and a job that spins me around in cirlces. When I have the time I love to put in this DVD and just take an hour of me time. I try and do it at least once a week because it really nourishes my mind, body and soul. A wonderful DVD if you are looking for a peaceful class that will leave you re-energized and ready for whatever life has for you.",1374019200,2,411,3.7906976744186047
8547790,5,B00A7CZ4RA,"If you are searching for peace and a mighty workout in one...you have come to the right yoga DVD.  At certain times, I find it especially difficult to center my thoughts on Christ and not get worn out with the demands of the world.  Spending just 1 hr in the calming presence of this Gentle Journey, brings what matters most, back into focus.  The bonus....A strengthening workout!",1355356800,6,381,4.656716417910448
8547791,5,B00A7CZ4RA,"I have been taking classes at Yahweh Yoga for years and it has been such an important component of my spiritual, emotional and physical health.  This DVD is absolutely beautiful and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be strengthened spiritually and physically.  Although I can complete the Power class, this is still my favorite.  It's a great overall workout (strength, core, flexibility) that helps me relax and calm my anxious mind with a clear focus on Jesus.",1354665600,10,474,4.9
