4511159,5,B00501BH88,"Great true story I personally dealt with as a Chicago cop.  Paul Sorvino played the near stone deaf lawyer Lowell Myers incredibly convincingly.  Levar Burton captured the essence of the deaf and dumb Donald Lang's real personality.  They used the old Cook a county jail and a real guard Bernard Cheserliegh with a speaking part. I only wish the made bigger budget feature film instead of a made for TV because Sorvino & Burton could have won Oscars.  Brian Dennehy was great as Lang's boss on the South Water Market.  It's a case that confounded the lawyers and courts.  We will never know the truth of what happened in the two killings.  The two dead hookers had violent pimps and DNA evidence was non-existent back in those days.  There were no actual witnesses to the killings.  The "" proof"" a taints Lang was only somewhat circumstantial at best.",1410048000,,851,4.695945945945946

8450554,5,B00501BH88,"I am a Deaf attorney and I have used this film in my Disability Rights Law class at a college here in Utah. Although I am giving this film 5 stars, I really wish they would caption this film so that Deaf and Hard of Hearing people can enjoy this film.

Donald Lang was prosecuted during a time when there was no legal protections for the Deaf (Americans with Disability Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) and when forensic technology did not develop (such as DNA evidence, etc). Moreover, there were no services available for Donald Lang that would have helped him tell his side of the story such as having a Sign Language Interpreter or a Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) available for him. Had the facts of this case happened today, Donald Lang would have been in a much better position to defend himself and to comprehended what was going on via ASL interpreters and CDIs. Many people debate whether or not he was guilty of these crimes but the real tragedy is the lack of services and legal protections that the government failed to provide him.

As a side note, if you think the movie is great, please read the book that the film is based on. Its called ""Dummy"" by Earnest Tidyman.",1421452800,4,1195,4.527777777777778
