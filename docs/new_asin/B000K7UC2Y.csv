2684010,3,B000K7UC2Y,"A lot of action. All fights, axcept the final, were intence.",1173312000,,60,4.545454545454546
2684011,2,B000K7UC2Y,"A pretty good movie, it was definetly better than I expected it to be, good enough for me to submit a review about it.",1173312000,,118,3.9583333333333335
2684012,4,B000K7UC2Y,"I really liked ""Undisputed"" so I was excited to see that a sequel was made.  The fight scenes are really good.  These types of movie usually aren't about having great plots, but I liked the plot here too.  Micael Jai White is a good actor and I'd like to see hime in more action movies.  He could've been a great Blade if Wesley (who did it well) didn't want the job.  This version of ""Iceman"" Chambers is more more like a cross between Wesley and Ving's characters in the first movie.  If you liked the first, you'll love this one.  Even if you didn't like the first, give this one a chance.  The stories are only connected by the main character.  I recommend this one.",1170633600,,670,4.296
2684013,4,B000K7UC2Y,Not often do sequels come out better than the original especially when you're talking about B-Movies but this film is the exception to the rule. I rented it and I swear I didn't want to give it back. This movie shows that you can have good action fighting without biting the Matrix. If you like fight flicks then you'll love this one. I'm sure this will become an underground classic.,1170633600,9,384,4.5
2684014,4,B000K7UC2Y,"Prison martial art/fight movies never seemed to work very well for me.  Bloodfist 3 and Circuit 2 were about the only decent ones I can recall, but Undisputed 2 is far better and probably one of the best made to date.  Michael Jai White, a highly skilled and athletic actor, finally gets a lead role in a film.  Unfortunately, his character is limited to that of a boxing champion - not a martial arts expert, though White is skilled in that area (his fight scene in Universal Soldier The Return against Van Damme is awesome).  He does learn a bit of the martial arts basics however, to go up against his nemesis in the film - played by the incredible Scott Adkins.

Adkins' character is so cool, you almost want to cheer him on instead.  His athelticism is fabulous and he performs moves in his fight scenes that are incomparable to any other martial arts fighters I have seen on film.  He also gets nearly the same screen time, and about equal the amount of dialouge as White in this film, allowing his charcater to be explored too.

The story is typical B movie prison scenerio - illegal fighting, in Russian prison etc etc some guy wants to get rich who heads the fights.  The script does in fact suffer some, but the movie progressively gets more interesting.  There is even a happy and tender ending, alsmot weird for a film with such profanity and such, and its kinda cheesy but hey, something nice for a change.

Its good to see that martial art/fight movies are still being made, for there is a definte audience out there.  Undisputed 2 is a great above average film of its genre, and far better than the first Undisputed.",1170115200,3,1631,4.491525423728813
2684015,4,B000K7UC2Y,THIS WAS A O.K MOVIE! BUT I THOUGHT THAT SCOTT ADKINS WAS A BETTER FIGHTER THEN MICHEAL JAI WHITE! THE MOVES THAT SCOTT ADKINS PERFORMED IN THIS FLICK WAS VERY GOOD!,1169683200,,165,4.354838709677419
2684016,3,B000K7UC2Y,"I was disappointed by the poor writing of this script - primarily the LACK of development of a compelling story and the crappy dialogue that Michael Jai White is given. He deserved much better than what he was given.

The LAST 1/2 of the movie is much better and develops several other characters and supporting crew.

If the first 1/2 would have taken the care of the last 1/2, my rating would be higher.

Michael Jai White is a very good fighter. However this movie primarily showcases the athletic prowess of Scott Adkins, who performs some phenominal moves for the camera. This guy is in beyond AWESOME shape. He plays his part quite adeptly.

I'm looking forward to seeing him in more films.

This movie is not for kids.",1169078400,,725,4.589147286821706
2684017,5,B000K7UC2Y,"michael jai white performed an amazing role in this feroucious fighting movie. although a quite cliched jail fight screenplay, but he played so well and so convincingly sincere that made this movie one of the best boxing and martial art mixture movies ever made. added up with tony yaa's two great movies, 'ong bak' and 'the protector/honor to the beast', together these three movies viewed in 2006 have been a great satisfying pleasure.",1165881600,10,437,5.0

2684166,5,B000K7UC2Y,"Excellent movie. Very sad though. Made us angry how people can be so heartless, cruel, hateful. I don't know if I can even call them human, just plain evil beings were the ones that made this person suffer since he was a child and go to prison for something he never did...for many years is just a disgrace. I don't know why those who put him thete falsely didn't have to pay. They should have been imprisoned for the rest of their lives.",1393200000,,438,4.289156626506024

up outside in the cold,and then how he in return got them all coats. Then how he and the old man in the wheel chair bonded, and the4n at the end what the ""Ice Man"" Did for him.

2684216,5,B000K7UC2Y,"This was one of my favorite MA movies, had a copy but it was missing when I was living with my sister in law. Great movie I believe though. Boxing champion set up and thrown in prison and ends up competing with the prison champion not once but twice. Thats all the details I'm giving",1376956800,,283,4.163636363636364
2684217,5,B000K7UC2Y,"Undisputed II from beginning to end was undisputedly great!  I saw Undisputed I with Wesley Snipes.  It was really good.  But they went a leap further with Undisputed II.  At first, the usual cliche' about an innocent man being framed for a crime, then sentenced to hard time in prison.  But, then it all gets interesting as Michael Jai White (""Ice Man"" Chambers) adds in a little ""tough guy/good guy"" spin to the role.  Predictably (in a very good way), Michael's martial arts is not just entertaining, it's amazing.  Not to be counted out, the supporting characters brought a 3d effect to a 2d movie.  Excellent martial arts choreography throughout the film.  Without question, I have to say that Scott Adkins (Yuri Boyka) now has a new fan.  In fact, he did so well in this movie, I immediately searched for, and found, Undisputed III, simply because Adkins starred in this version of the ""Undisputed"" franchise. I may report on that later.  I've trained in martial arts for over 40 years, and I've seen and done inspiring feats.  Seeing Scott Adkins in action reminds me that there is no end to my training.  His character (Boyka) believed he was ""the most complete fighter.""  That, to me, was deeply inspiring.  As one of the best of the best in prison fight movies, or of today's fight movies in general, I strongly suggest every fight fan see UNDISPUTED II!!",1376870400,2,1365,4.70042194092827

2684223,4,B000K7UC2Y,"In the beginning I thought of just another gangster story.  But something kept glued to the story, it was about in Russia an American black fighter who thought he could not be touch.  Yes he was arrogant and deserve some reality check in a foreign country he did not belong in.  But he was treated just like all the others in a Russian prison and he learned to become passionate of others and they became his friend.

It's weird... about halfway through the movie, I was like, ""Did I see this movie before?"" Who knows? Who cares? In six months, I'll probably sit down with it again and thoroughly enjoy the best darned prison fighting movie I've ever seen... Obviously, Michael Jai White is awesome, as is the dude who plays Voika. The plot totally works for what it is and the fights / action are superb.  Other reviews go more in depth in terms of the plot -- no reason for me to re-cover that material... so I'll just say this: if you want to see a really great prison fighting movie, here you go, this is the one to watch.",1375401600,,822,4.324675324675325

And there were no wires or CGI used in the fights! I'm sure it helps that both he and White are both real experts in various martial arts.

2684255,4,B000K7UC2Y,"This movie appears to be digitally animated, or enhanced or something, but it's very well done. I could hardly tell sometimes, and when I could, it looked artful, not cheesy. The story, though a tad abrupt at first, unfolds into more than just a kick boxing/boxing movie, and a couple of undercurrent themes and pretty well developed characters make it even somewhat touching at times. The fighting is a little unbelievable, but fun to watch. All in all I would highly recommend this movie for a fun distraction that is well executed. There is nothing offensive in the movie so it's pretty good for the whole family, though it is an incarceration fighting movie. It is perhaps not for little girls but the boys will love it and it includes some morality points with an uplifting conclusion.",1356134400,,790,4.773722627737226
2684256,5,B000K7UC2Y,"I grew up watching every Jean-Claude, Chuck Norris, and Steven Segal movie of the 80's and 90's.  If it had action in it, I watched it.  I recently saw Expendables 2 and got a bit nostalgic.  I was very impressed by the fight scene between Jason Statham and Scott Adkins even though it was short. I liked Adkins' fighting skills, and that made me think of all the stars I mentioned earlier.  I wasn't familiar with his work, so I got on Amazon and found Undisputed II.  Now I'm even more impressed with Adkins skills.

I never saw the first Undisputed and it's not necessary for the story.  Michael Jai White is George Chambers a former boxing champ who gets set up and thrown in a Russian prison to fight against ""the most complete fighter in the world"" Uri Boyka, played by Scott Adkins.  People outside the prison place bets on the fighters.  The mob owns the prison and is losing money since no other fighter can beat Boyka.  They're counting on Chambers to turn their fortune around.

The story may seem like it's been done before but not with this kind of action.  The fight scenes are gold.  Adkins is truly amazing and steals the spotlight.  All of his moves left me in awe.  If you're a fan of MMA or action movies, see this movie now!!!  I can't believe it took me this long to find this movie.  The DVD has some extra features including commentary while the movie plays.  I was willing to pay much more for this movie but got it super cheap on Amazon.  There's no excuse for not owning this one.  I plan on watching it again with the commentary even though I just watched it yesterday.  Yes, it's that good!!",1356048000,5,1619,4.383838383838384

2684268,3,B000K7UC2Y,"I wouldn't call it a renaissance necessarily, but there seems to be a noticeable jump in consistent quality direct to DVD action releases, particularly martial arts flicks.  Several years ago I wouldn't be caught dead trying to watch the low budget B movies which were dumped onto DVD with flashy cover art, but with directors like Isaac Florentine and actors like Michael Jai White and Scott Adkins, the DTV selection has vastly improved.

Undisputed 2 is a very fun film that sags in the usual areas B movies such as this do, like story, but has many redeeming qualities, like the fight scenes.  The real star of this film are the fight scenes and how satisfying they are to watch, particularly when it comes to Scott Adkins, who plays the bad guy in the film.  I rented this movie mostly because I am getting back into domestic Martial Arts movies as their quality has increased and Micahel Jai White is a very talented and accomplished Martial Artist who I enjoy watching on screen.  Adkins completely upstages White in this movie, which was surprising to me.  I found myself looking forward to when I get to see the Adkins character next as he was so much fun to watch.  Now White was handicapped a bit since his character is a boxer and doesn't use most of the moves White would have at his disposal in other movies but Adkins' moves and athleticism displayed in other films is also more exciting than what I have seen from White.  Michael Jai White is awesome, don't get me wrong, but through Florentine I have gotten more acquainted with Adkins and he comes very close to the level of excitement Tony Jaa can bring to a film and that's one of the best compliments I can give to any aspiring action star.  The way he hurls himself across the screen and defies gravity, unassisted by wires or quick edits, and manages to keep his balance as well is a sight to behold.  If anything, watch this movie to see Adkins at work.

Florentine and Adkins seem to be on the same page when it comes to choreography as the fight scenes are directed seamlessly.  It's no wonder Adkins and Florentine have hooked up for multiple movies since this was released and that Adkins is the star of the recently released thrid film which I plan to check out.  There is so much going on during these fights yet Florentine manages to show you everything without overdoing the slow motion.  The only times he uses slowmo is just before an impact, then he cuts to a new angle and shows the impact in real time and it really draws you into the fight.  It's some of the best camera work and editing I have ever seen in a martial arts flick.  You get to see everything in real time and can focus on the action instead of getting confused by MTV style rapid editing and cutting so many other films rely on to create a sense of chaos.

Where the movie falls short is where most action films tend to fall short, particularly those that never make the theaters.  The story is far fetched and the writing is mediocre.  The characters are a little flat too with cheesy Russian accents.  White is a great martial artist but his acting is stilted and he seems to be at home playing the badass, hardly ever showing any vulnerability in his characters.  Adkins' Russian accent is more of a caricature of a stereotypical Russian, but he pulls off being the bad quite well and his face does light up with more expression and emotion than White's.  The secondary characters could have really boosted the film had they been more colorful, like in the first season of Prison Break where everyone seemed to have a story and was immediately interesting.  The people you meet in this film, you have met in other films, they don't stand out but their acting is surisingly competent for secondary characters in a low budget film.  Action movies don't need a great story or particularly deep and colorful characters to be entertaining, but the great ones have everything.  Undisputed 2 is a lot of fun, watch it and enjoy it, but I can't give it a higher rating than I did because it could have been better.  They should have dropped the Chambers character from the first film and let White play as a martial artist instead of a boxer so he could really show off what he's got against Adkins.  Having Adkins as the only real adversary for White means that the action isn't nonstop so you are left to cope with the relatively weak story but it's not bad by any means just not particlarly captivating.  You will most likely be yearning to see more Adkins in action while the movie tries to tell it's story in between fights.

I originally got this movie to check out Michael Jai White in action and I walked away as a brand new fan of Adkins and Florentine.",1282867200,,4710,4.495305164319249
2684269,3,B000K7UC2Y,"This movie is actually pretty good for a sequel, as most sequels usually range from bad to terrible. The main focus and forte of this movie are the actual fight scenes, as both of the main stars in this flick do really have martial arts skills and use no doubles in any of the fight scenes (save for the dining area brawl where the two guys crush a table). As a result, the fight scenes are really cool, but for me the fighters lack the personality and charisma of Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames in the original (who are mainly actors and not real boxers, of course). Still, there are some fine supporting performances in this sequel given by Ben Cross and Eli Danker.

The story line is kind of weak in places. For starters, George Chambers comes to the prison as strictly a boxer, and within a few weeks of training by an old inmate (at least that's the timeline I inferred), he's ready to kickbox toe to toe with the undefeated champ--ehh, not likely! Also, when Chambers makes a deal with the head mobster, he demands that all the prisoners that were banished to stay outside in the cold be given brand new, expensive coats to wear to keep warm. Hello--how about demanding that they be brought back inside? What's the point of keeping them outside if they're going to stay warm in their coats?? Save some money!

Which brings me to my other nitpick...Chambers' character and personality changes too much between the beginning and end of this movie. At the beginning, he has the same chip (boulder) on his shoulder attitude as Rhames displayed in the first movie, rude, crude, and obnoxious... ""F--"" this, ""F--"" that. However, his conscience and regard for humanity DRASTICALLY improves to where at the end of the movie, he has a big heart of gold, practically shedding tears of joy at the sight of his old friend reuniting with his niece. Chambers had just spent the last month or whatever in one utter hell of a prison--I would think his attitude toward life in general wouldn't have improved much. I mean, it's great for someone to turn over a new leaf and be a better person, but that was a bit unrealistic for George Chambers, I think.

Yeah, so the ending was pretty corny...hardly befitting the overall vibe of both Undisputed movies--short on sensitivity and brains, high on testosterone! (Hey, I dig movies like that once in a while!) Still, the fight scenes make the movie overall enjoyable, so I would still recommend it, especially for fans of the first Undisputed flick.",1267142400,,2485,4.6431818181818185
2684280,5,B000K7UC2Y,"Chambers is sent to a Russian jail on trumped-up drug charges. In order to win his freedom he must fight against the jailhouse fighting champ Uri Boyka in a battle to the death. This time he is not fighting for a title, he is fighting for his life. From the beginning to the end this movie is exciting and intriguing. The plot is solid and interesting and the cast is very well chosen. White does a very good acting as well as fighting scenes. Great soundtrack, an absolutely amazing ending. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.",1266105600,,539,4.510204081632653
2684281,5,B000K7UC2Y,"Unlike most of these kick-the-crap-out-of-the-bad-guy martial arts flicks we've been subjected to, this film effectively deals with another element nobody seems to hit on here.  It hits on the culture of a prison environment--period...You've got your gangs running drugs and bullying inmates and dirty officers right along in there with them. I enjoyed this movie, but I tend to watch other elements and think outside the box for a bit.  Ben Cross does an outstanding job playing the junkie inmate who has to choose between his life and his friend/cellmate.  You can't help but empathize with him--and I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but he's the one to watch for a bit.  He's an outstanding actor who doesn't get enough attention because he chooses roles for their quality and not the monetary amount. That character had been beaten down and subjected to so much, that even as a junkie one can empathize with him given the other crap that goes on in a prison.  It deals effectively with a topic I deal with at work each day, being that I'm a sergeant of corrections officers, but I don't tell what it is because I don't want to give it away, but if you want to watch a good example of what certain signs are in an offender, this is the video to get because Cross did an excellent job of portraying the character and his struggle with addiction. Even for those not into this genre, it's worth watching because one can learn from it.",1257033600,,1448,4.596899224806202

2684283,5,B000K7UC2Y,"""Undisputed II"" film is a godsend to the world of DTV cinema. Just when I thought that I would have to put up with substandard production values, stupid storylines, and talentless action scenes forever, along came director Isaac Florentine and gave us a break via this spectacular martial arts masterpiece. It seems as if Florentine's work had been building up to this movie the whole time - that the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Harvest/dp/B0009PW4B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Harvest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/US-Seals-2/dp/B0000DD774/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">US Seals 2</a>&nbsp;were merely vehicles used by the director to perfect his technique, which comes to a masterful head in ""Last Man Standing"". I'm flabbergasted why this never made theaters, but in the end, all that matters is how very good it is.

The story: former boxing champion George Chambers (Michael Jai White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dynamite/dp/B002BWP3W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dynamite</a>) is filming a low-key vodka commercial in Russia when he's framed for trafficking drugs and sent to a prison owned by a mobster (Mark Ivanir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>) making money off open-bet, televised fights between inmates. The criminal's plan: pit Chambers against his own champion - the sadistic martial artist Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja/dp/B002XTBE5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja</a>) - for the big payoff. The question is, will the proud Chambers agree to take part in the circuit? - and if so, does he stand a chance?

Let it be known that Michael Jai White is an amazing and underutilized action hero who has yet to see his best days...but Scott Adkins is clearly the star, here. Those of you who have never heard of Scott Adkins before will probably think I'm exaggerating, but he is without a doubt the single best movie martial artist of the modern scene. His acrobatic fighting style lacks definition but is more exhilarating to watch than any wire-worked stuff on the market today. His ability to throw a jumping roundhouse kick, twist in midair, and deliver a heel kick before he's even touched ground is unparalleled and would've made a lesser opponent than White look embarrassing by comparison. White does himself proud by playing the boxer and laying off the kicks for the most part. Their styles mesh well, but Adkins is the star of this squared circle. Expect a half-dozen fights of pure athleticism.

While this is a prison movie, it focuses less on realism and more on the competition aspect, so even folks who get squeamish about incarceration flicks shouldn't feel apprehensive. I like to compare ""Undisputed II"" to Jean-Claude Van Damme's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Hell/dp/B0000DBJ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Hell</a>&nbsp;from a few years earlier: while the Van Damme film emphasized depicting ""every man's worst nightmare"", Florentine's piece is more about surviving adversity and preserving one's fighting spirit. During his tenure, Chambers is forced to shower cold, beaten, made to shovel sewage, put into a submerged cell, and subjected to exposure, but he's never broken, and therefore, the movie is a lot less dark. The acting to support this tone is surprisingly good. White is very accomplished for a man who's made his career off of beating people up and more than up to the role. The British-born Adkins does an intense job at playing the heartless-but-religious Russian, who's found God in prison but will kill you if you interrupt his prayers. Eli Danker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Special-Forces/dp/B001OFM2TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Special Forces</a>) likewise pulls a convincing Slavic accent and gives what's probably the film's best performance as a terminal inmate and Chambers' last hope for redemption. Ben Cross (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Russian-Specialist/dp/B000CQ98FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Russian Specialist</a>) plays Chambers' conflicted cellmate and gives as close to a humorous performance as the film will allow, but shines nonetheless as a tragic victim.

With the exception of the bare opening titles, the production displays next to no evidence of its DTV budget. The only faults I can find lie in the two-dimensionality of the characters and that there aren't more on-level fights: White and Adkins have two confrontations (one which ends way too fast), but for the most part, the fights are very one-sided. Regardless, this is one of the best martial arts films of 2006, Hong Kong flicks included, and maybe even the very best as far as the careers of the cast and director are concerned. Quit stalling and get it.",1238544000,2,5117,6.295292439372325
2684284,4,B000K7UC2Y,"Wow!  I liked this way more than the original, and I liked the original.  I've waited a long time for a prison fight movie with action that's this frequent and this good.  The producers could have changed a couple more things and not had to slap this with a franchise tag but, after watching it, who cares?  The fight choreography is some of the best I've ever seen from a U.S. production.  Yeah, the story is silly and implausible, but this is a ""B"" movie, and fans of this type of thing will have much to relish.

There are some reasons it's a sequel:  The character of George ""Iceman"" Chambers, and the story about organized fights in prison, including gambling and mafia-involvement.

The differences:  Ving Rhames has become Michael Jai White; the antagonist has become the protagonist; the U.S.A. has become Russia;  rape has become narcotics possession; and Western Boxing has become Mixed Martial Arts.

Our story begins with ex-heavyweight boxing champ Chambers, in Russia with his agent, trying to make some money doing commercials.  He returns to his hotel to find some thugs going through his stuff.  He attacks them, but is hit from behind and rendered unconscious.  When he awakens, the cops are going through his possessions to look for any clues, and find a hollowed-out bible full of contraband.  He is then taken to a prison where the current champ, Uri Boyka (Scott Adkins, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") would like a shot at him.  Chambers refuses to fight until the Russian mob pays him a visit to inform him that his lack of participation will only result in a longer, more unpleasant stay.

Michael Jai White (""Exit Wounds"", ""Spawn"") finally gets a good lead role to show off his excellent fighting abilities and acting chops.  He is one tough, profane Bad A--.  However there's a problem:  Scott Adkins steals the show.  Other than this, I've only seen Adkins briefly in Jet Li's ""Unleashed"", but he is fantastic.  Director Isaac Florentine has used him in every movie he has done since this.  It's only a matter of time before other directors want to do the same.

My only gripe about the disc is that it is not widescreened.  I gripe about that a lot.  Though the entire film takes place in Russia, English is the only language spoken, but the DVD has optional Spanish subtitles.  This New Line release features a ""behind the scenes"" extra, and audio commentary by the director and the two leads.  If you like ""B"" movies with great fights, this has to be seen.  I will be tracking the other collaborations between Florentine and Adkins.  The only one that is currently available is ""The Shepherd: Border Patrol"", starring Jean Claude Van Damme.  Though we can look forward to the upcoming ""Ninja"", and the rumored ""Undisputed 3"".  RECOMMENDED.
