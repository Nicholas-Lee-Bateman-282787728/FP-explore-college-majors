8322631,4,B001MZVZJ2,"I enjoyed watching this old television series brought back memories of when I was younger when TV was TV.
Product id of very good quality and well packaged.",1395360000,,156,4.607142857142857
8322632,4,B001MZVZJ2,"This set only includes 8 episodes, which was disappointing.  Otherwise, I found it quite entertaining.  It doesn't quite match up with the historical account of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, but it's still worth watching.",1372032000,,222,5.138888888888889
8322633,1,B001MZVZJ2,"Have only watched the episode with Vic Morrow in it so far.  It was okay, but only because I like him as an actor.  Not much to the episode.  There really couldn't be.  I believe it, all of them, are only 30 minutes long.  Will probably watch it again one day.",1291161600,3,260,4.019607843137255
8322634,5,B001MZVZJ2,"This show ran when I was a small tyke and if my parents didn't watch it, I didn't see it. (Years later I would exact my revenge and wrest control of the tv from them.)  So this was a series I was unaware of.  Still, I love westerns and gave this a try.  Glad I did. A terrific show with fine performances by Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager.  Maybe --like WYATT EARP, BAT MASTERSON -- it wasn't the way it really was, so be it. This small set is a great introduction.  Look forward to obtaining the only other set from this series.",1266710400,6,529,4.097087378640777
8322635,5,B001MZVZJ2,My husband loves all the old westerns and this is no exception.  It is in a nice tin box and he loves it.,1264982400,2,105,3.5652173913043477
8322636,5,B001MZVZJ2,I thoroughly enjoyed watching these old westerns.  I would purchase the entire series if they were available.  Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager handled the difficult rolls of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid with ease.  Their ability to use humor and drama were amazing.  It didn't matter one bit to me that the story line was pure fiction.  Watching in black and white was easy because the quality of the programs was great.,1247097600,7,420,4.698630136986301
