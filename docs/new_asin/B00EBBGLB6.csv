8603416,5,B00EBBGLB6,"A wonderfully do-able, precise, targeted workout which really hones in on your tough to tighten areas like none other!
Surprisingly moderate and good for the 40+ set.  Even those over 60 will do this and feel challenged, but also, and even better, considered carefully!
Kudos to the great kathy Smith, a natural wonder at 62 years young.",1457913600,2,337,4.912280701754386
8603417,4,B00EBBGLB6,"Having been a huge fan of Kathy Smith back in the 90's, I figured who better to try Barre with for the first time! I wasn't disappointed. Simple yet effective moves are modeled and explained clearly. I enjoyed this dvd and definitely felt the burn.",1447977600,6,248,4.533333333333333
8603418,4,B00EBBGLB6,"This workout would be a good one to do if you are looking to tone up but are not looking for cardio or if you have issues with your knees or with workouts where jumping or high intensity is out of the question.  This workout is a ""barre"" style workout.  If you have ever taken a dance class, many exercises that you would use a standard dance bar are done with the assistance of a chair instead.  The pros are that you have compact 15 minute segments that allow you to work upper body, legs, butt and tummy and a short warm up of about 5 minutes.  Kathy is an expert instructor and shows modifications for easier and more challenging ways to do the same exercise so that it is a good workout for different fitness levels.  It is not the most interesting workout in the world, and there are many repetitions of the same exercise, but it seems to be effective and she points out proper form which is very important when you are exercising from a dvd.  I had some issues with the menu on this one, there was an option to play all or go to a specific segment, but after playing the specific segment it did not go back to the menu but assumes you want to go to the next segment.  Well, sometimes, you want to do them in the order you would like, so I didn't like that piece and think that it either should have let you return to the main menu or have it set in a matrix so you could do the pieces in the order you like to make your own workout if you do not have time for the full hour.  Other than that I think it is a well done dvd.  I probably will not purchase it (I borrowed a copy), but I may borrow it again when I want a specific toning workout.  Overall, good barre workout, not too challenging for a beginner and good instruction.",1401494400,11,1735,4.091445427728614
8603419,4,B00EBBGLB6,"I should give this negative stars because it is the exact same disc as TOTAL BODY LIFT from 2008, but to be fair, the content is decent-short, low impact segments using light weights-targeting different body parts. Kathy at her best finctionally but REALLY not nice to repackage an oldie without telling comsumers........",1387843200,23,321,5.1923076923076925
