8140931,5,B000HRLWPS,"This is a great scholary work presenting various elements of Ancient Egyptian history and its Black African character. The Black African foundations as elaborated by Hoffmann shows that Kemet was not the beginning of Civilization it was the end! This DVD deals with the African creation of Kemet all the way to modern traits and commonalities existing in other African countries. Dr Sambu also documents the views of the specialists and authorities whose views have been ignored or forgotten. He presents linguistic, mythic, and material connections. His research documents facts about the ancient and modern in African architecture and sculture also.
It is refreshing hearing an African talk Egyptology. I learnt a lot about the culture and language of Ancient Egypt and Africa, especially Kenya.
I think however that a new technique Dr. Sambu introduces for analysing who is African in statues of Ancient Kemet, excludes various Africans/Blacks that don't display protruding mouths enough.
I eagerly await the availability of Volume II.",1213833600,,1038,5.41358024691358
