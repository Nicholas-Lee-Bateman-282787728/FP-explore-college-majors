8451631,5,B0050PZ5UA,I really enjoyed watching this movie about a boy who gets a baby wolf from a man who kills the mother.  He exercises great effort to return the wolf the the wild after raising him as a pet.  Any wild animal is certainly different from a domestic cat or dog.,1403136000,2,257,4.12
