7801101,4,1896306217,"BLUNT is a season 3 episode of the long-running BBC TV program, ""Screen Two,"" an anthology series of 90-minute films. GUILTY CONSCIENCE is another made-for-TVer, but an American one.

In the first, Ian Richardson portrays Anthony Blunt. He was arrested in 1951 and charged with being the British contact for a Soviet mole stationed at Her Majesty's Washington D.C. embassy. Anthony Hopkins is Guy Burgess, a fellow counter intelligence operative who helps their spy in America to safely reach the U.S.S.R.

Hopkins stars in GUILTY CONSCIENCE as a criminal attorney contemplating divorce who'd rather kill his wife than pay alimony. He carefully works out in his mind different murder scenarios and using an imaginary lawyer counterpart calculates how each courtroom trial would play to the residing judge (his father's portrait) and how they'd conclude. Throughout all these mental gymnastics, the would-be assassin doesn't know that his wife is considering how to bump HIM off! A delicious screenplay is by the creators of the Peter Falk crime drama series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COLUMBO/dp/B0002COTDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COLUMBO</a>.

Once you add British Royalty
to the spy picture seems like things get very cloudy?
Any other man but Antony Blunt would have been hanged for being the spy he was for a very long period.
It isn't a big secret that the British-Soviet connection was the intermediate that got the A-bomb plans to the Russians in the 40's.
Some people think that the cold war competition was good for western culture.
The funny thing about British homosexuals working for the Soviets is that the Russian system was much harder on such behaviors than the British ever were. There isn't a big secret about the British [........] problem?!
Men kissing an a movie does come as sort of a shock.
It seems that Antony Blunt was sort of the Royal fairy...",1235260800,,971,5.612244897959184
7801103,3,1896306217,"First let me say; I really Like spy movies. And this being a true story (makes it very appealing) with Anthony Hopkins as one of the main characters along with the cheap price made it a must have.

With that being said, my DVD is from ""Passion Procductions"" This copy has both decent picture and decent sound. Could be better, sure but it is quite adequete and I think a better version/transfer than the one another reviewer has. But hey it's an old movie that never made much money so they aren't going to put bucks into the reprint.

It was for me very Staid, obviously a low budget movie. There's virtually no action and much of the dialogue been very english, couched with many axioms Americans aren't familiar with made it a bit hard to follow at times. Coupled with sometimes you can't even understand what they are saying. But these spots are that often and don't seem to be forfieteing any of the story necessaries. Also it leaves gaps of info. in the front and end of the movie. You never know exactly what these guys motivation is besides them being good friends. What were they shareing/giving up to the russians? And what did they hope to gain by that risk? For me it left made more questions than it answered. It was interesting but showed almost no cloak & dagger affair that I'm sure the real/complete story holds. Its flet like it was the sanitized version that was approved by the British M5.

There's a lot of display of how several of the characters including Hopkins part were Gay. In fact I think they spent to much time on this fact. Like in those days this was as bad as being a traitor? And the ending was, well abrupt and cut short wanting for the full play-out of how they got caught and how it was all handeled in the end.

For me the movie portrayed the English Government and Secret Service M5 either didn't really care about the trist, or was aware the whole time and working it from both ends... or maybe both. Truly a movie for those really into Spy movies.

If you like old spy movies I would recommend ""The Spy who came in from the cold"" 1965 with Richard Burton",1140134400,6,2096,4.391752577319588
7801104,3,1896306217,"Anthony Hopkins has made many made-for-TV movies, and this is one of them.
And it's better than most.
However, DirectSource's video transfer is grainy at best--my copy even jumps forward to the next  ""chapter"" before the end of the previous one! Hardly what I like to find in a DVD. (Therefore the rating of 3 stars instead of what otherwise would rate a 4 or even 4 and a half.)
If you're looking for a watchable version of this one on DVD, it will ""do,"" since the subject matter is good enough to hold one's attention. However, if you like your movies presented with a decent image quality, don't spend your money on this one.
I can only hope a DVD edition with better picture resolution than this one (the only one available at the moment) becomes available in the future!",1042416000,16,775,4.49645390070922

7801106,4,1896306217,"This film was made for the BBC in 1985. Anthony Hopkins, good as usual, played a robust, outrageous camp charm, a curly-haired Guy Burgess in Robin Chapman's version of Anthony Blunt's subversive activities. Ian Richardson is the spy Blunt and Michael Williams is Goronwy Rees. This is not a must to see movie, but you can have a very pleasant evening with Hopkins.",973209600,3,365,4.809523809523809
