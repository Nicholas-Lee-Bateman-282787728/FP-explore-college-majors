3050134,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Have you seen any of shinkai's films? If you watch Voices of a distant star and the place promised in our early days, they will all leave you with a gut feeling like your missing something... Best author designer ever i mean nothing compares to the work he does. He shows all the good quality's in art and anime together yet leaves to a further level than most other authors, if you can touch the heart it's self then you have reached a very high level. Many others think this as well, since he has awards beyond any other anime, short story, movie genre and by far this one has beauty written in the title. It is possible he is making yet another this one being similar to previous makes called ""SHE... and the distant apart."" which when i see that title it just makes my heart drop when you think about what he has done and the level he can take his work. anyway just wanted to say I love this movie and keep up the good work Mr. Shinkai...",1204675200,3,942,4.209944751381215
3050135,5,B0010TL6RQ,"""They say it's five centimeters per second.""
""What do you mean?""
""The speed at which the sakura blossom petals fall... Five centimeters per second.""

I've watched many anime movies, Hayao Miyazaki rating amongst my favorites, but Shinkai absolutely beat Miyazaki with this one, if you ask me.

5cm per second is the perfect portrayal of every day life. How many of us has had friends, even first loves, and thought they'd be together forever, only to have time pass by until we can barely remember their faces? How many times have we passed by someone and thought it might be someone we recognize?

The story is absolutely magnificent. Takaki and Akari, both children used to transfering, find each other after Akari transfers to the school that Takaki attends. Because they both prefer being inside, spending time in the library, they grow closer and closer, until even their classmates make fun of their supposed relationship.

But unfortunately, what could have been comes to an abrupt ending when life intervenes and Akari is forced to move all the way to Iwafune. And the story continues with Takaki's point of view, how time and distance rips him up from the inside. Because he'll always be looking towards some far distance place, having dreams about Akari.

She's the one for him and the fact that they're not together places him into a position where he's always troubled and where he doesn't even notice the other girls that do love him and are closeby.

It's breathtaking. The animation is magnificent and fantastically executed. The lighting and the backgrounds were just breathtaking, while the soft piano music that played in the background wasn't distracting and only added to the entire effect of the movie.

Trust me when I say that this is one worth to watch. And if you've downloaded it, it's definitely worth the 22 bucks to have the actual DVD.

Superb. And that's something I don't say often.",1202860800,63,1914,4.885802469135802
3050136,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I never thought that this anime would move me the way it did. I guess I watched it not really expecting much, but it really helped me reflect on my life and how my interactions with everyone has had an affect on who I am.

The title refers to the speed at which Sakura flower petals fall from the the tree. The petals are like us, falling from the tree of life. As we fall, we encounter all sorts of people. There will be people who we will fall in love with, however by the time the petals(us) reach the ground we don't know who will be beside us.

Its done rather well. I've never bought an expensive collectors version of any movie, but I went out right away and bought the collectors version. Hopefully, the dub is done well and the special features will also be included.",1200700800,56,776,4.236486486486487

I can relate to the story.  I had a friend in high school that I cared for and wanted to date; but, my mother forbid me to do so.  I regret that I followed her wishes.

3050161,3,B0010TL6RQ,"And I mean that in the least informative ways.

What's good: Everything visual. This animation captures the cityscapes, the railways - I mean the rights of way, and the whole physical world in evocative detail.

But all that detail circles around high school, maybe middle school jealousies and insecurities, which I never understood even then. The imagery is beyond reproach, but can't raise the mild and shallow feeling very far.

This movie, more than many, will get different reviews according to reviewer, Well, no review is ""objecitve"", they all come from some base of experience and slant. Your ranking may differ, and I graded this one up because of so many opinions no tmy own - maybe a misguided feeling if fairness. Like it or don't accorfing to your taste.

I was really tired so I didn't mind watching a slow paced movie such as this one. I watch it and think to myself this movie was alright at best. It had good animation but there was no real story. After finishing the movie my thoughts changed completely. The ending brought the whole movie together and KOed me in the feels.

Some anime can be allowed to be just a simple story without the need of a slide rule and a flow chart to understand the plot.

Five Centimeters Per Second is a simple love story divided into three interconnected stories.  The love story isn't fully explored nor does one love interest catch a fatal disease or have a life-altering accident.  It's just a bare bones romance story.....and, I have to be honest here....I was kinda bored with the love story but the animation is GORGEOUS.  We really need more quality animation like this

3050185,4,B0010TL6RQ,"I decided to rent this movie before making a purchase because I was skeptical of the plot and my interest in it. Love stories are a hit or miss with me, anime or not.

I was thoroughly impressed by the artistic attributes of the film. The story is good, the visuals are great, and art direction is extraordinary. Every backdrop contains the details objects need to be realistic. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The sounds are accurate to real life (like walking in fresh snow or the sound of rain drops striking plastic containers) in many scenes.
At times, I would forget that it's an animated film I'm watching due to all the detail. A lot of love and dedication was placed in this film. Attention to detail is prominent throughout the entire film.

I may decide to buy this film. The art is inspiring to me. The story is good as well. This feature is acceptable for all audiences as far as I can tell. No nudity, no bad language, and no suggestive themes.
Just a good, rather sad, story with lovely artistic visuals. I just wish the film was longer.",1464048000,,1061,4.408163265306122

3050189,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I watched this movie from a streaming service on a whim knowing absolutely nothing about it, the director, or anything.  What I found was something that was, as I can only describe it being,  an emotional kick in the balls.  By the time the movie was over I was wondering what the hell it was that I just watched and I wanted to hang myself, in a good way.  I cannot tell you the last time, or if ever, I was moved by a movie, let alone an anime movie.  The overall story and premise is extremely depressing but at the same time real.  This is absolutely NOT a feel good anime, which within itself, is actually refreshing considering what most anime's are.  It was the exact OPPOSITE of basically every other anime I had watched up until this point, so it was basically a shock to my senses and went against everything I have ever known to exist in anime.  After reading about this movie after the fact, I discovered this was the directors intention all along.

STORY:  It's a very basic story, and from other reviews I have read, this seems to be what people like the least.  However I tend to disagree, and fans of anime know that the story of boy meets girl is a very common theme and that in the vast majority of anime's they all end the same.  That's actually were I think this story, though basic as it is, excels beyond the standard theme.  Broken down into 3 parts, but all flow together very well based on the main characters age.  The main problem I have is that the movie is too short.  I am reluctant to go into much detail about the story because I don't want to spoil anything.  I'll just say that it's a boy meets girl love story, that in it's parts, starts and ends probably within a 20 year span. If you want action, excitement, giant robots, or half naked anime girls, then this movie is not for you.

ANIMATION: I didn't notice anything truly exceptional in the animation.  I've seen nicer aesthetically speaking, but I've seen worse as well.  The movie is beautiful don't get me wrong, but there's nothing truly unique being done, which is absolutely fine given the story.  This isn't a giant mech, space dragon, action movie.

SOUND:  Amazing.  The sound quality is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the voice actors they chose did an excellent job.  The end theme is one of my absolute favorite songs in anime.

OVERALL:  The movie is a mess of complex basicity (did I just make up a new word?).  It's a movie where when a very simple basic premise can become something much more when done properly, and done not in the standard way that other anime movies would have it.  It's an absolute gut punch and though I want to shoot myself when it's over, it's a movie that I have watched multiple times, and will probably continue to watch multiple times.  I can say with 100% truth that this movie ranks easily in my top 10 all time favorites and possibly even cracks the top 5.",1461024000,8,2898,4.394736842105263

3050200,5,B0010TL6RQ,"""5 Centimeters is a story in which nothing happens... The tale lacks the dramaturgy that an animated work ought to have as entertainment; yet, my desire was to create an animation in which nothing extraordinary occurs. This is because in more cases than not, we ourselves live daily lives that are by no means extraordinary. If that daily life could be portrayed beautifully, however, then perhaps that would allow us to believe that our own day-to-day experiences are treasures worth living for."" - Makoto Shinkai

I found this quote in a tiny booklet that came inside the disc case, along with more on 5 Centimeters Per Second from the director, Makoto Shinkai.
The case itself is pink, as shown in the picture, and since I order my movie collection alphabetically, this movie goes into the first spot, where it feels right at home standing out among the blue.
5 Centimeters per second is, as the cover clearly states, ""a chain of short stories about their distance."" They, in this instance, are Takaki Tohno and Akari Shinohara, two very close childhood friends who are separated when Akari moves away. The chain of short stories is three links long. The first part shows Akari and Takaki as children, and focuses mainly on setting up the story, and then their last meeting before being separated. Part two is shown through the eyes of a classmate of Takaki's, named Kanae, in the future, when he is in high school. This part focuses on Kanae's feelings for Takaki, and clearly shows how the distance between him and Akari has created more distance in the form of a void between him and the others surrounding him. The final part shows where Akari and Takaki are as adults an how their lives have formed since part one. Some people describe this movie as a tear-jerker, but, in a word, I would describe it as captivating. On another note, I must add that the soundtrack, background art, and animation are outstanding.
Included on the disc (besides 5 Centimeters), are two of Shinkai's other films: The Voices of A Distant Star, and She and Her Cat. 5 Centimeters and Voices have the options to be played in either Japanese or English audio. All the films have an option of English subtitles. Personally, I thought all of the voice acting was excellent, although I have not yet watched Voices with Japanese audio. Also included in the extras, is an interview with Shinkai, where he is asked about topics such as: the inspiration for the name, comparing to his others works, and the process of creating 5 Centimeters Per Second.

I do not regret this purchase, and I have a feeling I will be coming back to this movie often. If you are not strapped for money, I would highly recommend picking this up.",1441497600,19,2702,4.710359408033827

Long before this, the 2008 Japanese-only domestic blu-ray release and the 2012 KAZE European release to blu-ray (region B, excluding English) are unplesant reminders of how poorly licensed this release is.

Makoto Shinkais 5 Centimeters per Second (2007)

Bittersweet, honest, and what Japanese voice actors call heart wrenching this story takes place around three main characters, Takaki Tono, Akari Shinohara, and Kanae Sumida, within three short stories, Cherry Blossom, Cosmonaut, and 5 Centimeters per Second, totaling to 65 minutes runtime. Cherry Blossom takes place in Tokyo, Japan, 1990s, where we are first introduced to elementary aged best friends, Takaki and Akari. In Cosmonaut we meet Kanae, who goes to Takakis junior and senior high. Finally in 5 Centimeters per Second we see Takaki and Akari in their early to mid twenties. Throughout these three short stories we see how each character is affected by life changes, time, and love.",1422576000,5,866,5.091549295774648
3050212,2,B0010TL6RQ,"I'm not sure precisely who the intended audience was for this movie. If someone said ""Make a child's love story devoid of any and all hint of testosterone, and spare no expense on the art"" then I could see this being the result. No normal man would find the dialogue either plausible or entertaining. From what I know of most women, they wouldn't either. Kids dislike romance movies for the most part, and especially in such a plodding format. Simply, the movie was not made for them. So, who does that leave? Perhaps girls from 13.5 years to 14 years old and, perhaps, some Otakus who might prefer their love stories androgynous (and pretty).

The best part of the movie are the endless high-end illustrations that you can freeze and learn from, if you are an art student self-taught or otherwise.",1420934400,,798,4.659574468085107
3050213,3,B0010TL6RQ,It was a ok movie. The blu ray movie quality was great.,1418601600,,55,3.6666666666666665
3050214,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Even though this movie came out a few years ago, I just saw it about a year from this review. The film split into 3 short stories, but they are all connected. The film is a little bit longer than an hour, which in my opinion, is perfect for this movie.  I really love the cinematography in it, the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, and the sound fits the film perfectly. There is no action in this, but again, in my opinion, it does not have pacing issues, and the dialogue is very poetic. I really can't say much more about the movie, without spoiling it. Overall, the film is one of my favorites of all time and I recommend it to anyone who like realistic, romantic movies.

The box itself is pink and comes with the Blu-ray, and a small booklet that has interviews and some art. The Special features are: Makoto Shinkai's first film (Voices of a Distant Star), a 5 minute short called 'She and Her Cat', and an interview with Makoto Shinkai. The 2 movies have English dub and original Japanese, with subtitles. The short and the interview also have English subs. The film does play in my Blu-ray, which tells me that it's region A. The price is steep, and 'I think' it's because you're buying it from Japan, so it has the Japanese prices, but I could be wrong. I feel satisfied with my purchase and I hope this short review can help you decide whether to buy or not.",1415577600,5,1370,4.368627450980392
3050215,5,B0010TL6RQ,"For those of you who do not know what this anime is about.

5 centimeters per second is an anime that takes a very realistic look at relationships. Since I don't want to ruin the story for those who have not yet watched it, suffice it to say that in life we often get so attached to something that we end up missing a lot of amazing things....that is what 5 centimeters per second is about.

Animation wise this is probably going to be in the top echelon of anime artistry it is that beautiful. Makoto Shinkai and Comix Wave studios are renowned for their attention to detail and this bluray version definitely does the anime justice. The colour palette is vibrant and popping, scenery, character design are all top notch.

I own the dvd version of this movie and when I found out that there was a bluray version (by the way this bluray has the English dub and English subtitles) I knew I had to get it. The pink bluray case is just a nice touch that helps this movie stand out from the myriad of blue cases that are a norm with blurays.

The price might be more than what you might be willing to pay but keep in mind that this bluray set was only released in Japan and you are getting Eng sub and dub and that the quality of the video is definitely worth the price of admission.

Overall I'm more than happy with this movie being in my collection and I would recommend this movie for both anime veterans and newer fans, it is a very down to earth story, a very realistic look at life and relationships, almost brutally so, which for me makes it stand out from the sea of action and fanservice oriented animes that we get now a days.",1415491200,4,1633,4.254838709677419

3050218,2,B0010TL6RQ,I watched this movie hoping that it will have the same effect on me as when I saw Voices of a Distant Star. But this movie just tried too hard to be depressing even though the characters are just plain pathetic. The main character couldn't let go of the past even after all those years of not seeing his first love. Voices of a Distant Star makes more sense and invokes more powerful emotion for a shorter length of time. The only good thing about this movie is the background artwork (not the characters) and also the music. In fact I think the best thing in this movie is the music video at the ending.,1394928000,,604,4.260869565217392

The English voice acting was also rather cheesy in my opinion. The male voice isn't bad, but the female voice is too exaggerated and girly, kind of how an American girl who is rather fake about her personality speaks.",1394064000,,444,4.6923076923076925

I'm not going to post any spoilers I feel if I did something like that it would be very douche of me, just trust me on this one... if you're into Romance and Drama, don't pass this one up you will definitely love this story.",1392768000,,600,4.3097345132743365

3050223,2,B0010TL6RQ,"I didn't realize there were 2 different versions of this movie.  The one pictured here, which Bang Zoom did a new English dub for.  And the original, dubbed by ADV.  Just to show that I'm no Bang Zoom hater, and that this is an objective assessment, I usually really like their work.  I thought they did a great job with Haruhi Suzumiya's English translation.  But this one was abysmal... namely Akari.  She sounded robotic, almost like she was just reading the lines off a card with no frame of reference whatsoever as to what was actually taking place in the film.  It was unwatchable.  Err, rather... unlistenable.

The only saving grace was that there was a neat storyboard version in the extra features, showing original artwork in the storyboards along with the dialog.  That was neat.  It's for that reason alone that I plan on hanging onto this version, even though I've now purchased the (superior) ADV version as well.

So buyer beware.  I highly recommend the ADV version, which can be found on here at present time, but is becoming scarce, and as a result the price will inevitably become absurd.  In fact I saw that new copies now are over $100.  I got a used one in ""Like New"" condition for $45, without a scratch on the thing, and consider it a very good bargain.  No reprints of the ADV version are likely to be made, so grab the remaining few while you can.",1374451200,13,1374,4.524390243902439

3050225,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This is a beautiful story. Strangely enough, the first time I watched it I must admit I felt a tad disappointed. I found the tale a bit depressing and slow, and surprisingly short. But after several more viewings, 5 Centimeters Per Second really began to grow on me. Now I appreciate this fine anime as one of my favorites.

For starters, the animation itself is superb. Shinkai has a sense of realism that I haven't seen anywhere else. He knows how to capture everyday reality and yet somehow still imbue it with a magical quality all his own. Secondly, the story--divided into three parts--is simply a beautiful tale of love that most people will be able to relate to. No matter what your take on the ending, this is a subtle and emotional journey, driven by characters who are believable and for whom we feel empathy. Finally, I must say that the music for the end is perfect to the last note and delivers quite an emotional payoff.

So, while I can see how 5 Centimeters may not be everyone's cup of tea, I encourage you to check it out and spend some time getting to know this moving story. Since it's only an hour or so long, it actually invites repeated viewings. You may be surprised--and you may find that it rewards your patience, as it did mine.",1370304000,9,1256,4.4803493449781655
3050226,2,B0010TL6RQ,"So I didn't buy the movie. I did watch it however. It was drawn out and sad. And not a good sad like in the lion king but sort of a hollow sad like when you spent 2 hours on something that should have taken 15 min and your work looks disappointing.

There have only been 3 movies in my life that I wish I could take back the time I've watched them and this is one of them. My boyfriend and I are huge miyazaki and ghibli fans and this came up as a recommendation.

3050231,5,B0010TL6RQ,"5 Centimeters Per Second is one of the finest animated films I've ever seen. The art is incredibly done even the smallest details are almost perfect, and the soundtrack is beautiful. The story is very touching. There were several moments during the movie that made my heart pinch. By the time the credits began my face ached and I wanted to cry.
It is a compilation of 3 short stories totaling about an hour. The story is about Takaki and his love for his childhood friend Akari. As their lives move forward the distance between them grows until all they have is fond memories and old love letters. The second episode is about a classmate of Takaki's that also loves him. It is a very bitter sweet love story. The whole story is fantastic. You shouldn't hesitate to buy this movie.",1348272000,3,781,4.546099290780142
3050232,4,B0010TL6RQ,"Well let me start by saying that this is one of the premiere works of anime short story writing. It's not the typical romance film and takes a very different angle than what the typical viewer is probably used to but will still unfold into a great story that should have some impact in one way or another. Luckily, you do not have to be a hardcore anime viewer to enjoy this film. However at the same time, one of the first things you will probably notice is the animation which is Makoto Shinkai's hallmark. The animation is really one of a kind, and still maintains that title years later after it's release. I will throw a slight caution in that I have tried viewing this film with other people and it has been acutely hit or miss. So while I personally recommend it, I can't necessarily say everyone will find the same value to this film as I, or others, did. Tough film to rate because of this.

Tough film to find these days in it's original print, making it almost a collector's item, so Amazon had comparatively good pricing from many sellers.",1347753600,,1051,4.417525773195877

After seeing that first film of his, I wanted more (to say the least!). I tried to find ""5 Centimeters"" at the library, but no luck. So, I went on Amazon and decided to buy it.

3050238,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I watched this film today while taking a break from work, and enjoyed it immensely.  The film's most pleasing aspect, in my opinion, is the internal dialogue of the male character, Takaki, which was often rendered in highly poetic language (or at least my copy's translation was).  Animes often attempt poetic or philosophical dialogue and only end up sounding pretentious, or willfully obfuscatory.  These lines were beautiful, though, and crystal clear.  Probably one of the best films I've seen about growing apart, and definitely the most realistic.  Highlights include the extended train ride in Chapter 1, which is heartbreaking, and all of Chapter 2 (Cosmonaut).  The only aspect I didn't approve of was the long ending song, which I felt could have been instrumental or perhaps simply a cut to a black screen.  The ending itself (before the song begins) accomplishes all.  Five stars.",1339113600,,892,5.145833333333333
3050239,3,B0010TL6RQ,"I think such a claim is a tad bit presumptuous, though.  That said, ""5cm Per Seccond"" is a very interesting and still profound film with many layers of depth and meaning.

FOR INTERESTED AND CONCERNED FOLKS...
First, there isn't much to worry about in this film.  The language is tame and clean.  I don't remember cussing or provocative language.  I don't remember innuendos and there no instances of fan service or related material.  It is pretty clean.

MOVING ON...

Plot:
This film consists of 3 half-hour segments (I think they are referred to as ""stories"").  All three of which are independent yet connected.  The thing about this film, though is it really can't be described as a movie or a series.  Rather, it is best approached as a visual poem.  If poems became films...this is definitely one form it would take.  The theme is ""5cm Per Second""...the idea that, as a cherry blossom petal falls (5cm/second is it's average speed of falling), it makes many different and unexpected connections and path changes.  The same  with life - as we ""fall through time"", we often wind up in different paths than we originally predicted.  He expounds on this through focusing on the lives to 2 people.  An overarching situation exists for both of them, but not really a plot...instead, you see what happens in their lives at 3 different stages (the episodes).  Narratively speaking, it's not strong or existent in the usual sense, but that's not it's point anyways.

Visually:
It's stunning!  Very Very beautiful, actually.  The cover art is but a mere shadow of the beauty and realism depicted in the film.

Extras:
There are interviews of Makoto Shinkai (the director) and the Japanese cast.  This is particularly insightful and very interesting.  Adds to the dialogue that the show, itself, started.  Also, there is a ""making of"" montage.  This one I did not find as interesting (I prefer interviews and stuff).

ALL IN ALL...
This is a film that comes pretty close to being an ""art film"" rather than ""pure entertainment"".  But, though it is very beautiful, it was ultimately forgettable for me.  Still, the strange thing was it kept drawing you back to finish it.  Strange, huh?  Now, it did move my emotions in spots, but in the end I did not feel like I got too much out of it.  Actually, it left me depressed.  Up to this point, Shinkai's films kinda do that to you haha.  But even so, one cannot deny the love, care, and detail put into this film.  The music is beautiful...until the end credits.  And with it's strong emphasis on reality, this could have been performed live without losing anything.  Ultimately, you really need to be in the mood for a poem...you can't passively watch this one bit.  Also, the rating is ""pg"", but the thing is, this will fly above most kids.  The themes are what drive this work, and they are very mature ones, indeed (and very subtle).  Ultimately, I don't regret the purchase and it did give me some things to think about...but it's not a film I would ""hail"" or anything like that.  This is a film that will force sides...some will love it, some not as much.  For me, it just wasn't my taste.",1337558400,,3134,4.664835164835165
3050240,5,B0010TL6RQ,This is an anime that you really cannot find the proper words to explain why it is great. The best way to describe it would be a must buy and to keep it on top of your anime pile at all times because when you watch it you'll want to show all your friends who love anime. At least all the ones that watch anime that have a great deal of emotion and feeling. I suggest getting it and watching it over and over.,1335312000,,408,3.869047619047619
3050241,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This show is amazing.  It could be considered many things, but to sum it up, it is simply about life.  The different stages one goes through in life, the experiences, the emotional attachments, the happiness and the heartache.  I can relate to this show so much its kind of scary.  It really draws some strong parallels to my life.  I think every single person could relate to this film on some level, from the aspect of one of the characters if not all.  I kind of wished for a happier ending, but I guess thats why I feel this show is an accurate portrayal of life.  It doesnt always have a storybook ending.  In general I was left with a feeling of sadness.  The story itself is told exceptionally well and the animation is amazing.  I think it could stand to be a little longer.  The 3rd episode was very short.  I actually had to re-watch the 3rd episode to fully understand what was going on, because it moves fairly quickly, which I'm sure was done purposely.

3050243,4,B0010TL6RQ,"5 Centimeters Per Second is a 2007 anime by director Makoto Shinkai.  It tells the story, mainly, of Takaki and his path from a relationship in his early teens to the new one present day.  Spanning three short episodes, Shinkai masterfully weaves this content into a remarkable piece of work.  I just wish it had ended differently.

From the start, the art in this film was staggering - I fell in love instantly.  The colors are vibrant and the environments are stunningly accurate.  My wife is from Japan and she was marveling at how precise the designs actually were, especially the train stations.  I've spent some time in Tokyo myself and felt the same.  Visually, this movie is as great as I've seen and the time flew by because of it.  I was left wanting more.

5 Centimeters is also written well.  There's some poetry in what's being presented here and some of it is heartbreaking.  I picked up the movie without doing any research and was gifted with a script plotted surprisingly well.  Most of us have been fortunate to experience young love and nearly all of us have at least had the sort of crush depicted here.  The innocence of that took me back and I felt so warmly towards the first two episodes of the film because of it.

My only problem here, and it felt like a big one, was the way the film ended.  And I don't mean the storyline or art, these things are covered, but it was so abrupt and capitalized with what felt to me like too tacky and aggressive of a song.  I'm probably irking someone with this part but to break it down simply: I was lulled by this movie for nearly its entirety and had the rug pulled out from under me at the last minute.  The contrast was just too stark for me.  There was a soft, rolling group of emotions I was pulled over by the director and it felt good.  The movement was slow and sometimes sad but introspective and most certainly something to soak up.  Is this making sense?  I was addicted to the pace and the end felt rushed.  (I found out from my wife at the end of the film that the song was extremely popular in Japan at the time.  It's a reasonable explanation but still disappointing - the music chosen for the rest of the movie was perfect.  They didn't need a pop track.)

I guess part of the reason I moved from mainstream American cinema to independent and foreign films is because I'm tired of this sort of thing exactly.  It makes me overly sensitive, I'm sure.

Still, I will be watching for work out of Makoto Shinkai.  I'm reading things here and there where people have labeled him, ""the new Miyazaki"" but I'm not sure that's accurate.  Miyazaki is a whimsical fantasy writer and illustrator with an intimidating and unbelievably unique imagination.  Shinkai, though?  Judging from what I saw in this film, I'd guess that the man knows hurt and has figured out how to present it with real beauty.  THAT is exciting.

Sans the belching crescendo, I admire everything about this film and recommend adding it to your library.

Thank you for your time.

It has three chapters and the first two were kind of sad, but made sense.  The last chapter was really sad and a little confusing.  I know many animes have somewhat sad or not really satisfying endings, but this was one of the worst endings ever.  I wouldn't bother buying this one, maybe if it's free on youtube or something, but don't bother buying it.

There are 3 mini stories, all linked together.

The way I see this movie is each story is about a different type of love.

Pure and Innocent Love.
Love that will never be returned.
And Love that is lost.

Makoto Shinkai has created a beautiful world with amazing art.  The visuals are fantastic, and the sounds are spot on.
Light shines through windows, reflecting off of surfaces, bells are given the Doppler effect.  At times you cannot help but feel that Makoto Shinkai is just showing off, because everything has been meticulously crafted.

The characters are incredibly introspective, speaking the million thoughts one would have when they are in love.  One cannot help but feel connected to at least one of the stories.
This is not a happy story, nor funny.  It is romantic, and tragic.

To view with subtitles only with original Japanese voice-over, you have to select both Japanese and English subtitles options under Language setting.  I don't much care for dubbing, but that's also available.  Extra features are nice, but not really needed since this animation can pretty much stand on its own.  It's better to let the viewers interpret on their own rather than having the cast members and directors drag on about their interpretation and intent behind the characters and themes (1 hour combined time to dissect this by the participants), but again, fan of this movie/animation may appreciate this nonetheless.  Storyboard edition is also available for movie buffs and future animation hopefuls.

3050253,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Makoto Shinkai's third film is a tour de force that shows off his growing mastery of beautiful scenery, pristinely depicted emotions, and heart wrenching story telling. 5 Centimeters plays off the ephemeral nature of beauty and joy - the speed at which a cherry blossom petal falls - to say profound things about the nature of love, human relationships, and the strain that the passage of time and the demands of modern life create. I was utterly caught up in the beauty and tragedy of the story and count it among one of the very best anime i have ever seen.

Shinkai has often been compared to Hayao Miyazaki as master of the anime medium. If referring to skill of presentation and artistry, the comparison is certainly apt. But the stories that Makoto Shinkai tells evoke the aesthetic quality of Yasunari Kawabata's novels - beauty that is at once delicately nuanced but that reaches deep down into the heart of human experience.

With this third installment, fans of Skinkai's earlier works (The Place Promised in our Early Days and Voices of a Distant Star) will see similar themes evoked in 5 Centimeters that have been polished by Shinkai's continue progress as an artist.",1302220800,16,1180,4.807881773399015
3050254,4,B0010TL6RQ,"Synopsis: Surreal in its beautiful visuals while showing a tale of heartbreaking reality, 5 Centimeters Per Second would be the perfect anime movie if not for a few mistakes in its direction.

Anime tends to indulge in over-the-top fantasy or science fiction or ""action"" tropes, and unfortunately this often comes at the price of the ""human element"" of storytelling. Makoto Shinkai averts this trend in his film 5 Centimeters Per Second, a work that contains almost otherworldly visuals while grounding itself in the real world, following the young Takaki Tohno through his journey of childhood romance and maturation.

5 Centimeters Per Second's visuals swell with richness - and not just in a superficial, overly-detailed eye-candy sense.  The scenes that contain Takaki and other characters portray their actions and emotions in a potent yet pure visual fashion without resorting to caricature, while the scenes absent humans are rife with metaphor.  The film's powerful visuals transform mundane everyday occurrences - such as riding a train or shopping in a convenience store - into absolute marvel, all while reinforcing recurring motifs that tie the various points of the story together.  5 Centimeters Per Second sits atop the vast world of anime visuals, not just for its beautiful scenes and animation but also for how effectively it uses them.

While Shinkai aces the visual aspects, his decisions in the other areas of film direction disappoint sometimes.  The choice of narration sticks out the most - it adds nothing that the visuals don't already show, but instead sours the subtlety of many scenes with ham-handed angst.  An example: Takaki looks at his watch and the schedule he drafted, and now seeing that he's  hours late he crumples up the sheet of paper.  What a perfect, fast, efficient way to show his disgust and frustration - no narration needed!  But then Takaki's internal monologue intrudes, proving redundant at best.  Another jarring example of a questionable directorial decision crops up in the second act of the film, where the story focuses on another character and her perspective of Takaki.  In the middle of following Kanae, the perspective leaps to Takaki in his room and without any compunction or subtlety his inner monologue proceeds to explain the metaphor of the rocket launch (a scene which occurs later).  Fortunately, Shinkai's directorial miscues don't go much further than that.  The slow pacing of the film accentuates Takaki's torturous delay-filled train ride in the first act and Kanae's hesitation in the second, creating a powerful emotional connection with the audience.  The third act moves quickly to show Takaki's adulthood - a quick glimpse of his life, work and relationship - before unveiling the most heart-wrenching of all story resolutions in all of anime.

Overall, 5 Centimeters Per Second comes closest to what might be the Casablanca of anime - a beautiful, bittersweet romance story that feels planted in reality.  Subtract the forceful narration and 5 Centimeters Per Second becomes nigh perfect.",1301961600,26,3067,5.224489795918367

Makoto Shinkai's animation and storytelling combined with Tenmon's musical composition really strikes at your emotions. Shinkai has been called the ""Next miyazaki"" and I have to agree and disagree at the same time. Shinkai is certainly a great director, on par with Miyazaki for sure. However, they both have different styles and their genres are noticeably different. Miyzaki focuses on fantasy and children's stories, Shinkai focuses on Sci-Fi and realist fiction. Although, Shinkai'S new movie, ""Children Who Chases Voices from Deep Below"" is really Miyazaki like. He probably has been listening to what people has been calling him. He does cite Miyazaki as one of his inspirations.

I would give this movie even more stars than available and hope they make a blu-ray edition, I would definitely get it. Beautiful artwork, beautiful story, and beautiful music. I suggest anyone who watched this to watch Shinkai's other movie ""A Place Promised in Our Early Days"" as well.

3050259,4,B0010TL6RQ,"It is indeed a very interesting movie, in the sense that although one might not like the ending, one still feels emotions stirred. Maybe it is sadness or maybe it is the over all sensation of being in love, whatever it is, the movie is effective in prompting it. I really liked this movie but must also say that Ocean Waves left me with a more optimistic and happy feeling.

I guess the reason why some people (I am) are deeply touch by this movie might be because they identify at some level with the feeling of ""silent love"" or unreciprocated love. However, I also think that Takaki as a young man might not be the ideal guy who deserves a fulfilling love life. It is fine to be an outsider or bohemian while in middle and high school, but as he was growing up and developing as a grown up, how come he was not able to develop significant friendships? Why didn't we see in the collage the happy parts of his life where he is indeed a well adapted young man with rowdy friends and healthy relationships with other females? Do we have to imagine he went through 10 years of constantly not being happy?

Maybe this movie indeed show us the difference between (some) boys and (most) girls, the way boys will always hold dear their first love and have it in high significance while girls will move along and enjoy fully the love that is offered by other suitors at different stages in life.

How appealing would an adult Akari find an unhappy and unsmiling adult Takaki? How compatible would have they been had they found each other? Was Takaki still 13 years old, emotionaly?

I would have enjoyed a ""typical ending"" of having them found each other and living happily ever after, but I also appreciate the emotions stirred by the real ending (can't always win). However, I would have enjoyed more a clearer signal that Takaki FINALLY puts it together and is able to be the happy, friendly young man that he should be. The smile Takaki cracks at the very end gives me hope, but I wished I could be sure. I wish him and his girlfriend good luck.",1273708800,,2041,4.420212765957447

3050261,5,B0010TL6RQ,"5 Centimeters Per Second is another lovely anime movie, only about 1 hour long, created by M. Shinkai and his company. It follows the love story of 2 children who grow attached because they both have allergies and feel different from the other kids in school, but they are separated in later grade school when the girl's parents move. For years they keep in touch by letters. As a young teen the boy rides the train to see his love in person in her hometown, and they spend a platonic night together. However, once the girl becomes an adult she falls in love with another person, leaving the young man listless and unsettled in the big city. There is a middle segment in the movie about another girl who falls in love with the boy, but he doesn't really seem to see her as a person, just someone to hang out with. Always his mind keeps drifting back to his old love and he clings to that relationship in his memory.

So in one hour you will be subjected to a lot of heartache and angst, but also you will enjoy great beauty and exquisite music in this film.

It's a crying shame ADV lost their license to carry this film in the States, so soon after it obtained it and put the film out on a very nice quality DVD. Now the DVD is almost impossible to find unless you have 100 dollars laying around for an OOP one. Be careful of rip offs and bootlegs with this title. Make sure the DVD you get is the ADV version, used. I did hear news about Shinkai wanting a redub of this film in English, which may have something to do with the fact the ADV license was pulled. Very frustrating, because the English dub is quite well done. I liked the voices very much.

One of the most refreshing things about this movie is the length - its clocks in at 62 min, just a tad over an hour. While most films tend to drag on and on, this one does not. Its broken down into three 22min chapters, and tells the story about a boy (Takaki) and girl (Akira) moving apart from each other - not by choice - but because of circumstances beyond there control. A friendship which starts in elementary school that is filled with happiness, hope, and security... is slowly torn apart by space and time. How does it all end? Does he eventually re-unite with Akira and they live happily ever after, does love and patience eventually pay off for Takaki, who desperatly believes that someday him and Akira will be together? Watch the movie and find out, after all, its only an hour. An hour well spent.

5 Centimeters per Second: A Chain of Short Stories About Their Distance tells the inevitable tale of seperation, a story of how the people we meet, friends and lovers, whom we believe we'll know forever gradually drift apart.

The story is nothing short of magnificent. It involves two main characters Takaki and Akari who are both school children drawn together by the fact that they are both used to transfering, after Akari transfers to the school that Takaki attends. As they both enjoy being inside the school spending time in the library, they grow closer until they are essential in a relationship.

There friendship is brought to a sudden end when Akari is again forced to transfer and move all the way to Iwafune, leaving Takaki behind. The story continues from Takaki's perspective, picturing how the distance from his love affects him mentally and emotionally. His focus and attention is constantly looking towards some far distance place, thinking about Akari. Due to this his life deteriorates as he is unable to concentrate on anything close to him.

The animation is breathtaking thanks to the lighting and the backgrounds which are simply beautiful. The score also increases the effect that the movie has upon the viewer. The story is fresh and never cliche. Although plot progression seems slow, the story is just taking its time to truly demonstrate how a young boy is affected by the seperation from his best friend and first love. The viewer can empathise with his feelings as it is a sad inevitability in life.

As I could not gain this movie in the UK I downloaded the English dub off the internet, as I was so impressed with the film, I bought the original subtitled version from America (as it has not been released in the UK and the English dubbed costs to much to have posted overseas). I am pleased that I was able to support the official release so that Shinkai may be able to go and develop equally, and hopefully even better, touching animated stories about space, time and relationships.

Common objects like chairs and cartons of chocolate milk seem to have some importance and element of poetry that contribute to these visual stanzas. The cramped horizontal camera frame is somehow opened up to make room for the broad and colorful scenery presented in this movie. You could press mute and still be engaged by the amazing artistry here.

In fact, I wish I had pressed the mute button...

The melodramatic and love soaked narration is so dripping with sappiness that this might have been better if it were a silent film. The writing tries way too hard at poetry and poignancy, and so you get heavy handed adjectives and words like ""shimmering"" and ""eternity"" popping up every chance they can get. The body language of the characters said more about love and loss than the story's laborious exposition. Especially story one, ""Cherry Blossoms."" Silence would have been the ideal frame for Takaki's lonely anxiety as he tries to connect with his distant friend. Instead we get diary diatribes distracting from the otherwise delicate imagery. This would have easily been a five star masterpiece had the narration been nixed. There are many clever shots that echo each other, and their brilliance is in their subtlety. Yet the same subtlety is thrown out the window when it comes time for the narratives.  None of the three story lines are so complex that minimal dialogue couldn't have cued us into the challenges and barriers faced by the characters.

3050267,5,B0010TL6RQ,"CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!!

When I say that the art rivals that of Miyazaki, I mean it. The detail and attention to expressions and the clothes, the backgrounds, every little object has detail that jumps out and further presses the film's theme of isolation.

Before I say what is good about this film. I have to note that the first Act is pretty cheesy in its dialogue (and maybe that's just the way it's translated). I, as an avid Anime watcher, always watch my films in the original language with subtitles and sometimes if I've seen the film enough, without them. The Japanese version is better because the characters are done as they were first intended. But the acting is incredible as well as believable.

Each moment passes slowly and then speeds past the characters, much like the Cherry Blossoms that fall.

This film is about the pain of never being able to get to the person you care about the most and being able to tell them how you feel. Even though you say it, sometimes the time you spend apart makes you isolated and confused.

The story comes in three Acts (or sections) the first is about Tono Takaki, a young boy (at the start of the film) who takes an interest in another girl, Araki, who is lonely and awkward like he is. After jumping in to drag her away from students who are writing insults about her on the chalk board, he is helplessly drawn to the idea that they are both connected in their fascination with falling Cherry Blossoms. But because both of their families continually move and they have to keep transferring far away- their attachment becomes strained in an almost strange obsession with an idea of a paradise where they'd stay in the same place forever. But time passes like the falling cherry blossoms and soon they move through each moment in life, becoming more distant.

The Second Act is about Takaki at his new school (as a high school student) and a girl who falls for him because he's a nice guy on the surface and doesn't seem to care how strange and indecisive she is. But, even when she finally comes up with the courage and volition to confess, she notices that Takaki was always staring off into the distance whenever he was with her. That he was the furthest thing from being connected to the people around him. An amazing short section that breaks the heart in its honest message.

The Third Act is Takaki as a young adult (in his twenties approximately) and how he's inexplicably distant and unhappy with his current job and life. He struggles to understand why he can't keep in contact with Araki the way he used to and why he didn't turn around and see her across the train track (this is a specific scene in the movie- watch to see what I'm talking about) as soon as the train passed quickly. The moment they realize they may be able to connected, one of them is gone.

Perhaps the confusing part of the film is the end montage of Takaki and Araki's life. It's hard to understand what is going on. But in essence it is about how both of them have moved on and never really reconnected because their lives dragged them apart. The growing up that happens in the montage-divides the line between an ideal of Takaki's and reality.

This strange trio of anecdotes in Takaki and Araki's lives expresses a number emotions and harsh acceptances when people grow up: That some people will accept that they didn't get what they wanted and others will hang on to the sparse moments of joy that they got falling from the sky even if it's only for five seconds.

You can feel the two characters' pain, and anguish, which is rarely accomplished in a ""grown up"" animation.

However, the way Shinkai eloquently displays his talent makes it very difficult to give just that, an objective review. Besides the fine lines and perfect quality in art, the story by itself is to heart wrenching, I could barely stand watching the third chapter without taking time to take it all in. I'm not going into detail about the story line, many other reviews about this movie give enough about it. However, as each chapter progresses you feel more torn apart on the inside. Even from a guy's perspective it was difficult to watch. It's a slow moving movie, filled with one-liner love statements. There's no action, no comedic parts, and there's hardly any character dialogue, except in the second chapter. However, the movie gives enough character development to get emotionally involved.

All-in-all, the movie's storyline carries you much farther than you could ever expect. And when you add fine detail to art, the end result is a synergistic bliss all rolled in to one. I recommend at least a box of tissues.",1221350400,2,1133,4.901041666666667
3050275,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Shinkai Makoto has been someone of a hero for me. Back in 2002, when he won the award as ""Most Valuable Newcomer"" at the Tokyo Anime Fair 21 for ""Voices of a Distant Star"", I was blown away by his work for creating a short animated film by himself using only a Power Mac 7600/120 computer and various consumer and professional design and animation software.

In 2005, he returned with another award winning film titled ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" and his third film ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" which hit theaters back in March 2007 was another award winner for ""Best Animated Film"" at the Asian Pacific Film Awards.

But what makes this film different from his previous work is simply amazing. The previous films were very good but ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" is just perfect!

From the screenplay, the animation, the music - everything in this film is just perfectly done, well-planned and there is no doubt about it, Shinkai Makoto is one of the most brilliant animators in the world. There is something about his way of thinking, his way of animation that people just fall in love with.

With this particular film, ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" is a film divided into three parts.

The first part titled ""EXTRACT"" features two friends, Toono Takaki and Shinohara Akari, both attend a new school (fourth grade) with each other.  They have the same class and they enjoy the same things.  As they grow older, both are very fond of each other but in many ways, have difficulty expressing their true feelings for each other. During junior high, Akari moved away and transferred to a new school in a town in the Tochigi Prefecture. The two kept in contact ala penpals through letters sent to each other quite often.

When Takaki's parents move towards a country area (Kagoshima Prefecture) near the ocean, their distance has increased. Both are still wanting so badly to see each other, wanting to communicate their emotions to each other but still have difficulty in doing so.  One year after Akari has moved away and a week before Takaki moves, they both agree to meet each other in Akari's hometown. What will happen when the two reunite?

For those wondering about the title.  From the initial starting scene of part one, the title is derived from Akari telling Takaki that a cherry blossom petal hits the ground in 5 centimeters per second.

The second part is titled ""COSMONAUT"". The story continues years later as we learn that Takaki lives in Tanegashima, an island that is used by the National Space Development Agency of Japan for rocket launches. Takaki plans for college and to return to Tokyo but in the meantime, his classmate Kanae has fallen in love with him. In fact, it's more like love at first sight.

She very much wants to tell him how she feels about him but as for Takaki, his mind seems to be somewhere else. In fact, he seems to be texting on his cell phone quite a bit? Who is he texting to? And will Kanae reveal her love to him?

It's very interesting to watch this second part and to see how Takaki has been since moving to a new area and how one yearns for the past.

The third part is titled ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" and without revealing too much of this final part of the film, the story revolves around Takaki who is now an adult possibly in his late 20's. Working for a company and his life has changed since his teenager days. All I can say is this final segment alone is just one awesomely, beautiful visual piece with the awesome music of Yamazaki Masayoshi's hit song ""One More Time, One More Chance"" and just how everything just fits.

The storyline for each three parts is definitely heartwrenching and there are words said by each character that one can just come away watching the film and just realize how touched they were.

GRAPHICS:

The film is presented in 1:71:1 and is presented in 16:9 anamorphic. For me, what was accomplished via background art, character design and just overall animation was just perfect. The staff traveled to various locations and took thousands of photos and within the year and a half of making this film, you can't help but just be amazed of how much was put into this film.

From various scenery, skylines and locations in Tokyo or somewhere in the country, you get not a few but MANY background art variations. The way the sky, the city or town, the hills, the snow, the trees, the vehicles, a building or buildings, indoors, you name it...they take you on one hell of a visual tour that just screams of awesome, beautiful backgrounds.

I am just amazed of how realistic the background art was done and even though Shinkai says that he and his team are not trying to reach realistic sceneries but more of a scenery that one has in their memory of, I'm just digging every aspect of it.

The character designs are just impressive. From the emotional standpoint of the characters, to breathing patterns, the flow of wind and how it affects the characters, was remarkably done well on this film as well.

SOUND:

For the Japanese audio, it's presented in 2.0 with English subtitles with encoding at 224kbps while the English dub is in 5.1 and encoded at 448kbps.

As for the voice acting, I primarily watched the version with the Japanese audio but also watched it in English. My only problem with the English dub is when the beginning scenes feature a junior high Takaki, he sounds no different from an older Takaki. While in the Japanese version, there is a difference and amazingly, even discussed further about that situation by Shinkai and the voice actors in the bonus features.

But it was pretty cool to watch both because in a way, the variety of emotions in Japanese and the English dub, there with each character is different and you can probably watch both versions and come away with something different emotion-wise but both voice acting are well done.

The fact that for the Japanese version, what these voice actors were able to accomplish for their first time voice acting and the direction that Shinkai and staff wanted to achieve was impressive and you learn all about the casting selection and his experience on the special feature interview.

As for music selection, I was impressed by the music used. When I heard LINDBERG's ""Kimi no Ichiban ni"" in the second episode, I realize that they put the time period at around 1996. I was surprised to hear LINDBERG but even moreso suprise to hear Yamazaki Masayoshi's hit song ""One More Time, One More Chance"" and how it was utilized for this film. Excellent!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

For the special features, I can't tell you how happy I was to have an in-depth interview with Shinkai Makoto on this DVD. The interview lasts around 36 or so minutes and Shinkai really shows us what was on his mind from the creation, finding locations, the voice acting, the man is quite meticulous in his planning and he knows what he wants and how to work with great people and work together.

Also, where the previous films, distance and speed were a focal point.  Although distance is involved, he wanted to show the speed of how things change within time and how he shows the changes in different time periods of the characters is impressive.

I actually was surprised to hear about the growth of the staff and how everyone worked at his apartment and how the apartment could not handle electricity-wise of all the computers used for the film. So, he rented another apartment for more of his staff nearby and how they all worked together. It's so amazing!

He's also so down to earth that even during the interview, his cat was walking around his office and that's something you just don't see in an interview. That was interesting to see.

And to make things even more special is similar to a Robert Rodriguez or even Quentin Tarentino DVD of them helping film fans understand how they shot certain scenes, on this DVD, Shinkai has no problems of showing his thoughts of a creation of an anime and will show you steps of how they accomplished certain scenes and the staff using Adobe Photoshop for the backgrounds and character designs. I was so happy to see them talk about this and I just wish there was so much more.

I really enjoyed how they would show the original photo of the scenery and then show the after animated version, especially adding snow and giving a wintery feel. That was cool to see!

Shinkai has definitely become a fan favorite because of what he was able to accomplish by himself with ""Voices of a Distant Star"" but his approach to creating an animated film is just so avant garde, unique and fresh that I'm just proud of him and his work and how he plans things out. Especially his mentality and his observance of people, especially on how he selected his voice actors.

Also included in the bonus feature is interviews with the Japanese voice cast and the challenges they faced (since for many of them, it was their first voice acting job) and more importantly what scenes touched them and how they reacted to the film after watching it.

These are lengthy interviews and was very happy to see this.

Last is ""THE MAKING OF 5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND MONTAGE"" features behind-the-scenes shots of Shinkai and staff but also a few shots used on location for the film.

I can't tell you how much I loved this film.  Shinkai achieved perfection with animation, background art, screenplay, voice acting and the music, everything is just amazing!

This is not a film that could be live-action but done in animated form and even animated, almost reaching realistic settings through the background art.  Shows the talent of Shinkai and his staff.  Absolutely awesome!

There are not many people who have achieved perfection but it's amazing how Shinkai Makoto has evolved from a guy working on his own to winning an award, to getting a second film and working with a staff and now, his third film and a DVD that just showcases his mindset and what he set out to accomplish.

This is one DVD that deserves an A+, 5 out of 5 stars and simply a must-buy!  Highly recommended!",1218153600,18,10022,4.645727221279004
3050276,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This movie was a masterpiece of gentle, unassuming perfection, delicately yet heartwrenchingly executed.  On so many levels, cinematographically, musically, and content-wise, the film captures the essence of futility within daily life, the harsh indifference of love and desire, the sadness that accumulates in the objects of our lives, and the inevitable estrangement between people who care for each other, due to the inexorable pull of time, chance, and distance.  Some scenes were indelible in their simplicity, i. e. the way mere objects can become haunting when observed from a detached viewpoint, or objects as ephemera; there were scenes which, for me, invoked a Hopper-esque aura, such as persons juxtaposed against the cold and overwhelming industrial landscapes, and the underlying sense of alienation inherent in our current society.  At the same time, the movie strikes one as being timeless, capturing the agonizing impatience and desperation of first loves and long distance relationships with a poetic, crystalline dialogue.  The director was boyishly charming, intelligent, and extremely well articulated, and his passion was all the more convincing being tempered with that most lovely and welcome Japanese air of modesty and humility.

3050278,4,B0010TL6RQ,"*While I normally don't post a review by replying to another one I thought it would be most productive to respond to Jonathan's negative criticisms of this film since most of my praise for it acts as a counterpoint to his critiques.*

Wanting Shinkai to be ""the next Miyazaki"" is placing unnecessary preconceptions and restraints on a director who is a unique artist and not like Miyazaki at all. Miyazaki has succeeded because he's made Eastern fairy tales and fantasy palatable to a Western audience to which these things are often foreign. His style lies more in the narrative than in the aesthetics (though he doesn't exactly skimp in that area). Shinkai in terms of style, form, content, aesthetic, focus, etc. is nothing like Miyazaki.

As for the so-called ""pacing problem"" I agreed wholly that Promised was badly paced. But Shinkai's problem is that he couldn't decide what to focus on and how to weave the narrative together. There are two solutions to this; you either maintain a tight control over the flow of the narrative and the characters within it, or you sacrifice narrative pacing for aesthetic pacing. That's what he's chosen to do with 5cm. So the claim that 5cm has bad pacing is completely incorrect. Shinkai is not going for narrative pacing here, but aesthetic pacing. This is a classic technique of Asian art. You can see it in classic Asian film such as Ozu, Mizoguchi, Hsiao-hsien, and Ming-liang. Shinkai achieves this through his minimal focus on narrative, ellipses, pillow shots, musical montages, etc.

As for the music, I also disagree and think this film is another leap forward for Shinkai. There are several views when it comes to the best application of music for film, but one I like is Kurosawa's view that music and film go best together when both pieces are missing something; when a piece of music is missing something or a scene is missing something. That way putting music and film together 'completes' the other. I agree in Shinkai's previous films the music was more individual, more distinguished. But I think his application of more 'passive' music in 5cm is much better. And I rather liked how the ending theme compliments the film that came before. It might not be as superficially pretty as other music Shinkai has used (I think it's quite beautiful, but tastes will differ), but I think it fits much better in the context of the film.

The complaint that this is just a gooey romance rehashed from Promised isn't really fair from someone who's not attempting to conjure up an original and ""surprising"" narrative. If anything, the film is attempting to get to the emotions associated with the story more than presenting the story itself. Or, put another way, the minimal narrative opens a window into a river of complex emotions associated with such a simplistic and common idea as a youthful romance. Yes, this film is just a variation on his last two, but to criticize Shinkai for that is unfair. Yasujiro Ozu, one of the greatest directors ever, often repeated simplistic storylines using the same actors with even the same character names but just in slightly different circumstances. He did this so as to illuminate a different emotion, aesthetic, or theme each time. And by slightly shifting the content around, his oeuvre forms a kind of Cubist art where you get to see the same thing from different angles.

Shinkai is doing the same thing by using the same basic idea and slightly manipulating it with each effort to get something different out of it. You can't really do this switching to a completely different story, because then the pattern is broken. You can not like this approach and claim that it's just the same thing over and over, but to do so is to miss the point badly. Shinkai has finally honed his style enough that he seems to be aware of this. When he began, I thought he would end up going the more Miyazaki route of making sci-fi, fantasy, romances that fit more into a Western mold. But I'm rather glad that he's gone the opposite route and taken his films in a direction that's much closer to classic Eastern art. Because afterall, we have a Miyazaki, why do we need another one? Especially when there aren't enough artists like Shinkai in anime.

But even more than his Asian predecessors, Shinkai's films have come to resemble those of the reclusive, enigmatic, American director/poet Terrence Malick. After watching 5cm I was actually reminded vividly of Malick's Days of Heaven, which also features a minimalistic narrative that's used as simply a means for momentum on which the breathtaking visual aesthetics take over. This results in film that's the visual equivalent of poetry, and 5cm does indeed play more like a visual tone poem than a narrative driven film.

With 5cm I humbly think that Shinkai has crafted his most complete film to date. A stunningly gorgeous film filled with a rich melancholic tone. The kind of film to watch on a rainy day in a relaxed mood. It's a quiet and graceful film, a humble chamber piece set to a minor key; the anime equivalent of a Schubert Lieder. The 4 star rating is only because as much as I like 5cm, I still think Shinkai is capable of even better.",1216166400,17,5181,4.769230769230769

3050282,2,B0010TL6RQ,"I was skeptical about the assertion that Makoto Shinkai was the next Miyazaki, and although I really liked he two previous works,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voices-of-a-Distant-Star/dp/B00008G8QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voices of a Distant Star</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Place-Promised-in-Our-Early-Days/dp/B0009PLMAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a>, I could not bring myself to lavish him with such high praise until he made a movie that blew me away and that would become an instant favorite. It would seem that I made a wise decision. Miyazaki is undoubtedly one of the greatest anime directors to ever live, and his films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>) rival those of any genera, animation or otherwise. He's been said to be on par with Disney, but that is a lie. Miyazaki is BETTER then Disney. So obviously I'm always skeptical to people comparing an up and coming director to Miyazaki.

I watched Shinkai's carrier with great interest from his debut film Voices of a Distant Star to this new film. His strong suits have always been animation and music. No anime director I've ever seen can create such beautiful animation as he, and few can combine such stunning and magnificent animation with just the right music to set the tone and take his viewers far away to walk the snow covered streets along side the characters. He's great at this, but for all that talent he also has a critical flaw to his style which makes his movies miss their full potential; he has no idea what pacing means. Being only 23 minutes long, Voices was paced very well and never had a dull moment, but the follow up Places, being full length, was paced so badly it made me want to skip large portions of the film so I could see some more beautiful landscaping. If the animation and music weren't so great, I doubt so many people would love that movie so much, even though I personally gave it 4 stars.

But now, with his third film, I expected him to have found away around that weakness and create a film that wasn't just visually beautiful, but also well paced as well. Well sorry, but he hasn't done it, and my patience with him is wearing thin. In this three part film Tonoo and Akari are best friends in grade school who spend all their free time with one another, but as they grow up they slowly drift apart, contacting one another at first through letters and then falling out of contact altogether. It is, surprise, surprise, another romance. This would not have been a problem if this new film didn't seem like a carbon copy of Voices and Places, especially places. Guy and girl fall in love at an early age, guy and girl drift apart as life goes on and they grow up, guy and girl never get over each other and miss the other, guy and girl sit awake in their rooms all night thinking about the other, guy and girl never see each other again. If you've seen Places you can pretty much see everything that's coming. There are no surprises here, just gooey romance.

It's a real disappointment to see an animator with so much promise get bogged down in these silly romances again and again and again. Voices was good, Places was as well, but Shinkai always tells the same exact story. Its not that he likes telling a certain kind of story, it's that he likes telling only ONE kind of story, every single time. Get a grip man; make something a little more original. Its bad enough that his pacing is so bad but why even bother making new movies when you're just going to tell old stories again and again and again? If this is all Shinkai has to offer then it's not worth my time seeing every film he comes up with.

The animation, as always, is brilliant. I just don't know how much more I can gush over his amazing art. I've been saying this since Voices, but his three films are THE BEST animated films I've ever seen, and I've seen my fair share. Unfortunately this film is missing something; the music. Both his previous films have amazing musical scores that made the film just that much better. I never fail to catch myself humming their main themes after watching them without even noticing. Well I'm not going to end up humming these tunes, that's for sure. For one thing there wasn't enough BGM to begin with, and what little there is was just a remix of old themes. But the biggest disappointment was the ending song. It's just not pretty; I'm sorry, but Japanese isn't the most beautiful language to listen to. The ending song was nowhere near beautiful, in fact I found myself turning the volume down and playing a song of my own instead. If they had only play ""Don't Say Goodbye"" from Skillets album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comatose/dp/B000I0QJI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comatose</a>&nbsp;then it would have been the greatest scene ever (trust me, listen to the song and watch the scene and you'll see what I mean).

So no, this is not the next Miyazaki, not even close if this film is any indication. I don't think I've ever given a Miyazaki film less then 4 stars, he is far and away the most consistent director I've ever watched, so if Shinkai can't pull it off after three tries I think its an unfair comparison.

3050283,5,B0010TL6RQ,"""We'll always be together!"" vow the graduates at the end of the musical Grease.  Tons of movies have been filmed, and books have been written, about the intensity of childhood friendships.  But the sad reality is that the majority of us slowly drift apart from most of the people who meant so much to us in school after graduation - and, more specifically, don't usually end up marrying the first people we fall in love with.  This trilogy of shorts is a study about how we handle that life transition.

The main character is Takaki, a nice young boy, but a little quieter and less rambunctious than most.  The fact that he suffers from allergies clinches his preference for taking lunchtime in the library instead of the schoolyard.  There he meets fellow allergy sufferer Akari, of like mind, and the two quickly become inseparable, at first best friends but eventually falling in love.

Bad news is on the horizon, however, as Akari tearfully calls Takaki to tell him that her dad's job requires a move, and they spend some last, final time together.  At first they keep in touch, but eventually the text messages dry up, then the calls and finally even letters.  After one final, desperate visit, it's painfully obvious that they're no longer what they used to be to eachother - and they probably won't ever see eachother again.

That they were too young for their relationship to withstand Akari's move and not seeing eachother regularly - something that can topple even adult relationships - comes as no surprise.  The question is, rather, whether Takaki will move on before he misses his next chance at love pining away for an experience that by definition he can never have again and is now water under the bridge.

With an ending that allows us to draw our own conclusion, and some of the most stunning animation I've ever seen in an anime, I would highly recommend this to anyone who's ever revisited their high school yearbook and wistfully wondered ""where are they now?""",1213228800,2,1982,4.746355685131196
3050284,2,B0010TL6RQ,"I was skeptical about the assertion that Makoto Shinkai was the next Miyazaki, and although I really liked he two previous works,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voices-of-a-Distant-Star/dp/B00008G8QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voices of a Distant Star</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Place-Promised-in-Our-Early-Days/dp/B0009PLMAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a>, I could not bring myself to lavish him with such high praise until he made a movie that blew me away and that would become an instant favorite. It would seem that I made a wise decision. Miyazaki is undoubtedly one of the greatest anime directors to ever live, and his films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>) rival those of any genera, animation or otherwise. He's been said to be on par with Disney, but that is a lie. Miyazaki is BETTER then Disney. So obviously I'm always skeptical to people comparing an up and coming director to Miyazaki.

I watched Shinkai's carrier with great interest from his debut film Voices of a Distant Star to this new film. His strong suits have always been animation and music. No anime director I've ever seen can create such beautiful animation as he, and few can combine such stunning and magnificent animation with just the right music to set the tone and take his viewers far away to walk the snow covered streets along side the characters. He's great at this, but for all that talent he also has a critical flaw to his style which makes his movies miss their full potential; he has no idea what pacing means. Being only 23 minutes long, Voices was paced very well and never had a dull moment, but the follow up Places, being full length, was paced so badly it made me want to skip large portions of the film so I could see some more beautiful landscaping. If the animation and music weren't so great, I doubt so many people would love that movie so much, even though I personally gave it 4 stars.

But now, with his third film, I expected him to have found away around that weakness and create a film that wasn't just visually beautiful, but also well paced as well. Well sorry, but he hasn't done it, and my patience with him is wearing thin. In this three part film Tonoo and Akari are best friends in grade school who spend all their free time with one another, but as they grow up they slowly drift apart, contacting one another at first through letters and then falling out of contact altogether. It is, surprise, surprise, another romance. This would not have been a problem if this new film didn't seem like a carbon copy of Voices and Places, especially places. Guy and girl fall in love at an early age, guy and girl drift apart as life goes on and they grow up, guy and girl never get over each other and miss the other, guy and girl sit awake in their rooms all night thinking about the other, guy and girl never see each other again. If you've seen Places you can pretty much see everything that's coming. There are no surprises here, just gooey romance.

It's a real disappointment to see an animator with so much promise get bogged down in these silly romances again and again and again. Voices was good, Places was as well, but Shinkai always tells the same exact story. Its not that he likes telling a certain kind of story, it's that he likes telling only ONE kind of story, every single time. Get a grip man; make something a little more original. Its bad enough that his pacing is so bad but why even bother making new movies when you're just going to tell old stories again and again and again? If this is all Shinkai has to offer then it's not worth my time seeing every film he comes up with.

The animation, as always, is brilliant. I just don't know how much more I can gush over his amazing art. I've been saying this since Voices, but his three films are THE BEST animated films I've ever seen, and I've seen my fair share. Unfortunately this film is missing something; the music. Both his previous films have amazing musical scores that made the film just that much better. I never fail to catch myself humming their main themes after watching them without even noticing. Well I'm not going to end up humming these tunes, that's for sure. For one thing there wasn't enough BGM to begin with, and what little there is was just a remix of old themes. But the biggest disappointment was the ending song. It's just not pretty; I'm sorry, but Japanese isn't the most beautiful language to listen to. The ending song was nowhere near beautiful, in fact I found myself turning the volume down and playing a song of my own instead. If they had only play ""Don't Say Goodbye"" from Skillets album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comatose/dp/B000I0QJI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comatose</a>&nbsp;then it would have been the greatest scene ever (trust me, listen to the song and watch the scene and you'll see what I mean).

So no, this is not the next Miyazaki, not even close if this film is any indication. I don't think I've ever given a Miyazaki film less then 4 stars, he is far and away the most consistent director I've ever watched, so if Shinkai can't pull it off after three tries I think its an unfair comparison.

Replay value; low.",1212105600,9,5610,5.15257958287596
3050285,5,B0010TL6RQ,"To start off, I am a fan of the medium known as anime. Been watching it for, lets see, 5 or 6 years now. Something like that. Anyhow, lately alot of the anime has started dulling out a bit, becoming more predictable and unentertaining. Some recent anime have been good but overall the overpopularity of alot of series that I've been wanting to watch has turned me off.

However, I didn't hear much about 5 Meters Per Second. I heard the title before but never knew what this film was about. Saw it on a shelf at Best Buy one day and said, ""Hey, I've heard this title before."", and bought it.

I'm truly impressed and definitely not disappointed in my purchase. I've never seen any of Shinkai Makoto's works before this and I do say, now I want to see his earlier works.

The story involving 2 simple yet somehow complex kids turned adults over a span of 3 short stories was amazing. The unpredictability of this film was uncanny to say the least. The art work alone in this film caused me at several points to say out loud, ""Wow!"". This film not only set the bar for the next films to be released by any studio or director, but definitely deserves to be up there with some of the greats like Akira and Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke). If you are a fan of those movies, a fan of anime, or just a fan of something interesting and want an anime movie that you can relate to on a deep personal level, this film is definitely one to watch. I think even people who don't watch anime, but love films, should watch this one.

I do have to address this little thing here about how on the cover of the DVD case, they mention how Shinkai is the next Miyazaki. Now I can't argue that Shinkai's movies are definitely up to par with Miyazaki, but since I have yet to see the first 2 films of Shinkai (this opinion is based solely on 5 Centimeters per Second), that both directors deal in seperate genres. I find Miyazaki's works to be more fantasy and/or nature oriented, while looking at Shinkai, I find Shinkai to do better in the real life-type situations like what happened between Shinohara and Tono in this film.

Again definitely one to own of any type of anime fan. A must see.",1211932800,5,2173,4.342364532019705
3050286,4,B0010TL6RQ,"Wow. This is a stunning and beautiful anime. Makoto Shinkai is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. He has a fascination with the theme of lovers who are separated by distances. Longing permeates this work, like in Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. This particular anime is about two kids who fall in love for the first time, and then are separated when their parents have to move. It's told with visuals that are totally amazing. Few other anime has ever matched the gorgeous visuals conjured by Shinkai in this anime. I love the attention to detail, every reflection of light and ripple of movement is lovingly depicted. Love the way he shows a train ride through the snow, or a sunrise. There are none of the fantastical elements seen in his earlier works, this one is more grounded in reality.

Perhaps it's this realism that results in the sad ending. I felt like the film ended at a point similar to the midway point of The Place Promised in Our Early Days. It felt incomplete. I wanted more. It's a reflection of how young love cannot last. Kind of like Kevin and Winnie in The Wonder Years. By the time you finish this hour long film, you have this terrible feeling of heartache and loneliness. I guess that's what he was going for. It's not a tear jerker like Grave of the Fireflies, but it has its own emotional power. The ending song is also not as strong as the song from The Place Promised in Our Early Days.

I guess, if you're bummed by the ending of this anime, the antidote is to watch The Place Promised in Our Early Days, which does have a happy ending.",1211673600,4,1615,4.434343434343434
3050287,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Absolutely Heart Breaking. I experienced a similar childhood which made me relate to all the characters so much more, this movie really felt REAL.
Shinkai put together a film that weaved the emotions of love, desperation, cruelty, despair, and then hope. Never did a animated film ever hit my heart as hard as this one did.

As an animator I always put Story>Art, but needless to say this animation in this film was purely amazing. Every scene was stunning with incredible detail. Thats what drew me to this movie, the superb scenery I saw in the trailer.

Definitely worth it.",1210636800,,577,4.76

The English dub isn't bad either I originally watched the movie in Japanese with English subtitles but whether you are a English dub fan or a Japanese dub fan you will not be disappointed with 5 Centimeters Per Second.,1209945600,2,405,4.139240506329114
3050289,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Anime wunderkind Makoto Shinkai has made quite a name for himself both in his native Japan and abroad. After erupting on the anime scene with his entirely self made Voices of a Distant Star, Shinkai was hailed as the next Miyazaki, and was given a massive budget to produce a full length feature. The result was The Place Promised in our Early Days, a film that despite great animation and art, squandered its awesome premise. Two years later Shinkai is back with 5 Centimeters Per Second. Told in three short films, 5 tells a personal tale about time, distance and speed. Takaki starts the first film as a junior high student who is involved in a long distance relationship with a girl named Akari. Of the three films, this one especially will tear you apart like no anime since Voices has. When it reaches its heartbreaking, soul shattering conclusion, your face will be red with tears.

The second film starts in Takaki's senior year of high school. There he is courted by the shy Kanae, who has fallen deeply in love with him. Of the three shorts, the animation in this one is simply unmatched. The scenes are so beautiful that you will find yourself pausing the film just to get a longer look at each of these gorgeous frames. I won't hesitate to call 5 the single most beautiful animated work I have ever experienced. The second film ends in a similarly crushing manner as the first. Be sure not to miss the line where Takaki explains who he is texting throughout the short. If nothing else in this film brings you to tears that moment will.

The final film is the weakest of the bunch. This short sees Takaki in his late twenties, completely empty and forlorn. We see Akari moving on with her life, getting married, but maybe still thinking of her first love. The short doesn't really have an ending as concrete as the others. You are left to wonder if Takaki will ever find happiness or if he will forever be lost in his past. The movie ends with a montage over a strange Japanese pop tune that works well enough. Some viewers will feel unsatisfied with the conclusion, but I agree with other critics who hail this ending as Shinkai's most mature yet. Still, fans may miss the expected final line of wisdom that has ended every Shinkai work since She and Her Cat.

They won't be able to miss any other Shinkai staples though, as they are all present here. The color palette here is still the best in anime. The lighting is mind boggling, the characters are a little awkward, and the actual animation even surpasses the work put into Place. Tenmon returns to score all three shorts, a train separates lovers at least three times, beautiful sunsets background heartfelt moments, cell phones and letters connect distant lovers, most of the film is told through monologues, and the themes of distance, time, and speed are all present. I can only hope Shinkai shows some variation in his films before these themes begin to turn stale. As it is, they are still fully effective here, although the train sequence is starting to get old.

Overall, fans of Shinkai will adore his latest work, while moviegoers of any sort will appreciate 5 as a masterwork of animation and a heartfelt story from one of Japan's greatest writer/directors.",1209686400,2,3235,4.640488656195463
3050290,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Makoto Shinkai's film ""5 centimeters per second"" is one of the most moving and satisfying anime films of recent memory. The themes of love, loss and the emotional and physical distances between people have been explored before in his two previous works ""Voices of a distant star"" and ""the place promised in our early years"" however this new film strips away all the sci-fi elements and presents a raw and moving slice-of-life tale.

Presented as 3 short films examining the same relationship over time I think that anyone that saw this film would be moved by one if not all the  characters in the story. Whether it be the urgency Takaki feels when he goes to visit Akari,the sadness Akari feels as she is separated from her love or the quiet rejection Kanea feels when she realizes that her feelings for Akari are not the same, everyone can relate to some feeling.

Shinkai's trademark visuals of course present and as usual they are lush, cinematic and always beautiful. His ability to take everyday places like trainstops, convenience stores and wide grassy fields and imbue them with a realistic yet dreamlike quality is amazing.

5 centimeters is an excellent film and worthy of being seen by a larger audience including viewers who may not watch anime. Absolutely stunning.",1209081600,7,1278,4.875576036866359
3050291,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I've been a Makoto Shinkai fan since his ""Voices of a Distant Star"", and enjoyed (although somewhat less) his ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"". I've always admired his distinctive drawing style, his breathtaking landscapes, the pacing of his stories, and the underlying musical scores he chooses.

This was no different for ""5 Centimeters per Second"", although the three-part story makes the plot seem discontinuous compared to his other works. However, I found on reflection that the story really was consistently examining the same theme throughout.

I thought the length of the entire movie appropriate (as I liked the compressed story telling of ""Voices"", but wasn't as happy with the slower unfolding of ""The Place Promised""). The movie kept good emotional tension during the entire piece.

I won't go much into plot, except to say it is a good if somewhat melancholy look at relationships as seen through time, nostalgic and bittersweet.  I've seen it in my own life - friendships and romances, left to the vagaries of time and tide, never quite leave us completely, and color our reflections of what was and what might have been.

3050292,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Five Centimeters per Second was an excellent film.  The animation quality surprised me, from watching trailers from nearly a year ago, I immediately realized how detailed some of the scenes will be, such as the little shop in 'Cosmonaut'.  The color quality too shocked me.  I don't mind that some of the character designs seem pretty familiar, after all, Miyazaki done the same thing several times.

The story is told in three wonderful stories.  In short, the way each story is told is like a beautiful poem being spoken by the imagination.  The way he added One More Time, One More Chance, a relatively well known song in Japan added a sense of realism.

Another thing I found enjoyable was noticing the connection with She and Her Cat to this movie by a cameo appearance by Chibi.

Perhaps it was ADV's troubles during spring that the packaging is so limited, either way the packaging is simple.  Single sided art, no insert, and a slightly anemic menu system.  The latter however can easily be set aside as the music and simplicity seems to add to the overall effect.

He is excellent at creating those poetic vignette moments.  I haven't seen anyone who is able to fit together such scenes so elegantly.  Perhaps the thing that makes his movies so easy to relate to is that the overall themes of loneliness, longing, and love are things we have all went through.  The way he pulls it off will always astound me.  I do hope that the novel version will make it's way to the states.",1207353600,3,1485,4.593155893536122

The only qualm I have is with the packaging. I read in another comment that there is not much inside, and I have to agree. Although I didn't expect much besides the movie, there isn't even a little paper on the inside left, which would normally have the scene selection or something. Instead, I have two identical papers which are Devil May Cry advertisements. It would have been nice to have something for the movie, but instead my only choices are to leave it blank, which would look somewhat weird, or to have an ad for an Xbox game which I have no interest in.

Regardless of the packaging, this movie is great and I recommend it to any anime fans and especially those who enjoy Miyazaki or Shinkai already.",1206921600,,944,4.482558139534884

3050296,5,B0010TL6RQ,"After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, I finally got my hands on the domestic ADV Films copy of ""5 Centimeters per second."" (**Amazon shipped the order to me on March 19**).

Be it the original voice acting or the English dubs, this movie is a treat-fest. Both are done perfectly and should serve to excite fans of either one. I, however, prefer the Japanese voice acting; they are one of the best I have seen to date. Period.

The story is compelling and simply amazing. A love story between two childhood friends, Takaki and Akari, who stood up for each other only to be distanced by the harsh reality of surviving in the cruel world. The story is divided into three segments. Each segment is righteously different, and take a different approach to build up the story.

Another beauty to this title is the wonderful music. It isn't overwhelming, but not underwhelming either. A melodious piano being played in the background acts to compliment the romantic screenplay.

This month, 5 centimeters per second and Appleseed: Ex machina being released back to back, there is nothing more joyous to an otaku like myself.

You will be amazed at this ""Legendary anime"" (according to IGN.com:). According to the Japan Times (on the back of the DVD cover), Makoto Shinkai is hailed as the ""Next Miyazaki."" I am not that big of a Miyazaki fan, but if Shinkai continues to makes these Triple-A animes, then so be it.

""What do you mean?""
""The speed at which the sakura blossom petals fall... Five centimeters per second.""

I've watched many anime movies, Hayao Miyazaki rating amongst my favorites, but Shinkai absolutely beat Miyazaki with this one, if you ask me.

5cm per second is the perfect portrayal of every day life. How many of us has had friends, even first loves, and thought they'd be together forever, only to have time pass by until we can barely remember their faces? How many times have we passed by someone and thought it might be someone we recognize?

The story is absolutely magnificent. Takaki and Akari, both children used to transfering, find each other after Akari transfers to the school that Takaki attends. Because they both prefer being inside, spending time in the library, they grow closer and closer, until even their classmates make fun of their supposed relationship.

But unfortunately, what could have been comes to an abrupt ending when life intervenes and Akari is forced to move all the way to Iwafune. And the story continues with Takaki's point of view, how time and distance rips him up from the inside. Because he'll always be looking towards some far distance place, having dreams about Akari.

She's the one for him and the fact that they're not together places him into a position where he's always troubled and where he doesn't even notice the other girls that do love him and are closeby.

It's breathtaking. The animation is magnificent and fantastically executed. The lighting and the backgrounds were just breathtaking, while the soft piano music that played in the background wasn't distracting and only added to the entire effect of the movie.

Trust me when I say that this is one worth to watch. And if you've downloaded it, it's definitely worth the 22 bucks to have the actual DVD.

Ever since then, I have wanted to contact her just to see how she is doing.  Unfortunately, time is against me.  Our brief affair occurred over 50 years ago.

What's good: Everything visual. This animation captures the cityscapes, the railways - I mean the rights of way, and the whole physical world in evocative detail.

But all that detail circles around high school, maybe middle school jealousies and insecurities, which I never understood even then. The imagery is beyond reproach, but can't raise the mild and shallow feeling very far.

This movie, more than many, will get different reviews according to reviewer, Well, no review is ""objecitve"", they all come from some base of experience and slant. Your ranking may differ, and I graded this one up because of so many opinions no tmy own - maybe a misguided feeling if fairness. Like it or don't accorfing to your taste.

Five Centimeters Per Second is a simple love story divided into three interconnected stories.  The love story isn't fully explored nor does one love interest catch a fatal disease or have a life-altering accident.  It's just a bare bones romance story.....and, I have to be honest here....I was kinda bored with the love story but the animation is GORGEOUS.  We really need more quality animation like this

I was thoroughly impressed by the artistic attributes of the film. The story is good, the visuals are great, and art direction is extraordinary. Every backdrop contains the details objects need to be realistic. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The sounds are accurate to real life (like walking in fresh snow or the sound of rain drops striking plastic containers) in many scenes.
At times, I would forget that it's an animated film I'm watching due to all the detail. A lot of love and dedication was placed in this film. Attention to detail is prominent throughout the entire film.

I may decide to buy this film. The art is inspiring to me. The story is good as well. This feature is acceptable for all audiences as far as I can tell. No nudity, no bad language, and no suggestive themes.

3284686,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I watched this movie from a streaming service on a whim knowing absolutely nothing about it, the director, or anything.  What I found was something that was, as I can only describe it being,  an emotional kick in the balls.  By the time the movie was over I was wondering what the hell it was that I just watched and I wanted to hang myself, in a good way.  I cannot tell you the last time, or if ever, I was moved by a movie, let alone an anime movie.  The overall story and premise is extremely depressing but at the same time real.  This is absolutely NOT a feel good anime, which within itself, is actually refreshing considering what most anime's are.  It was the exact OPPOSITE of basically every other anime I had watched up until this point, so it was basically a shock to my senses and went against everything I have ever known to exist in anime.  After reading about this movie after the fact, I discovered this was the directors intention all along.

STORY:  It's a very basic story, and from other reviews I have read, this seems to be what people like the least.  However I tend to disagree, and fans of anime know that the story of boy meets girl is a very common theme and that in the vast majority of anime's they all end the same.  That's actually were I think this story, though basic as it is, excels beyond the standard theme.  Broken down into 3 parts, but all flow together very well based on the main characters age.  The main problem I have is that the movie is too short.  I am reluctant to go into much detail about the story because I don't want to spoil anything.  I'll just say that it's a boy meets girl love story, that in it's parts, starts and ends probably within a 20 year span. If you want action, excitement, giant robots, or half naked anime girls, then this movie is not for you.

ANIMATION: I didn't notice anything truly exceptional in the animation.  I've seen nicer aesthetically speaking, but I've seen worse as well.  The movie is beautiful don't get me wrong, but there's nothing truly unique being done, which is absolutely fine given the story.  This isn't a giant mech, space dragon, action movie.

SOUND:  Amazing.  The sound quality is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the voice actors they chose did an excellent job.  The end theme is one of my absolute favorite songs in anime.

OVERALL:  The movie is a mess of complex basicity (did I just make up a new word?).  It's a movie where when a very simple basic premise can become something much more when done properly, and done not in the standard way that other anime movies would have it.  It's an absolute gut punch and though I want to shoot myself when it's over, it's a movie that I have watched multiple times, and will probably continue to watch multiple times.  I can say with 100% truth that this movie ranks easily in my top 10 all time favorites and possibly even cracks the top 5.",1461024000,8,2898,4.394736842105263

3284697,5,B0010TL6RQ,"""5 Centimeters is a story in which nothing happens... The tale lacks the dramaturgy that an animated work ought to have as entertainment; yet, my desire was to create an animation in which nothing extraordinary occurs. This is because in more cases than not, we ourselves live daily lives that are by no means extraordinary. If that daily life could be portrayed beautifully, however, then perhaps that would allow us to believe that our own day-to-day experiences are treasures worth living for."" - Makoto Shinkai

I found this quote in a tiny booklet that came inside the disc case, along with more on 5 Centimeters Per Second from the director, Makoto Shinkai.
The case itself is pink, as shown in the picture, and since I order my movie collection alphabetically, this movie goes into the first spot, where it feels right at home standing out among the blue.
5 Centimeters per second is, as the cover clearly states, ""a chain of short stories about their distance."" They, in this instance, are Takaki Tohno and Akari Shinohara, two very close childhood friends who are separated when Akari moves away. The chain of short stories is three links long. The first part shows Akari and Takaki as children, and focuses mainly on setting up the story, and then their last meeting before being separated. Part two is shown through the eyes of a classmate of Takaki's, named Kanae, in the future, when he is in high school. This part focuses on Kanae's feelings for Takaki, and clearly shows how the distance between him and Akari has created more distance in the form of a void between him and the others surrounding him. The final part shows where Akari and Takaki are as adults an how their lives have formed since part one. Some people describe this movie as a tear-jerker, but, in a word, I would describe it as captivating. On another note, I must add that the soundtrack, background art, and animation are outstanding.
Included on the disc (besides 5 Centimeters), are two of Shinkai's other films: The Voices of A Distant Star, and She and Her Cat. 5 Centimeters and Voices have the options to be played in either Japanese or English audio. All the films have an option of English subtitles. Personally, I thought all of the voice acting was excellent, although I have not yet watched Voices with Japanese audio. Also included in the extras, is an interview with Shinkai, where he is asked about topics such as: the inspiration for the name, comparing to his others works, and the process of creating 5 Centimeters Per Second.

I do not regret this purchase, and I have a feeling I will be coming back to this movie often. If you are not strapped for money, I would highly recommend picking this up.",1441497600,19,2702,4.710359408033827

The film was flawlessly reproduced in 1080 HD blu-ray by CoMix Wave in their 2013 ""Global Edition"" release (region-free disc B005HZZG9I), with English and Japanese voice casts and 11 subtitle languages, including an interview with the director, the shorter film Voices of a Distant Star, and the early short file She and Her Cat as bonus content (bonuses in SD 480).  Long before this, the 2008 Japanese-only domestic blu-ray release and the 2012 KAZE European release to blu-ray (region B, excluding English) are unplesant reminders of how poorly licensed this release is.

Makoto Shinkais 5 Centimeters per Second (2007)

Bittersweet, honest, and what Japanese voice actors call heart wrenching this story takes place around three main characters, Takaki Tono, Akari Shinohara, and Kanae Sumida, within three short stories, Cherry Blossom, Cosmonaut, and 5 Centimeters per Second, totaling to 65 minutes runtime. Cherry Blossom takes place in Tokyo, Japan, 1990s, where we are first introduced to elementary aged best friends, Takaki and Akari. In Cosmonaut we meet Kanae, who goes to Takakis junior and senior high. Finally in 5 Centimeters per Second we see Takaki and Akari in their early to mid twenties. Throughout these three short stories we see how each character is affected by life changes, time, and love.",1422576000,5,866,5.091549295774648

If someone said ""Make a child's love story devoid of any and all hint of testosterone, and spare no expense on the art"" then I could see this being the result. No normal man would find the dialogue either plausible or entertaining. From what I know of most women, they wouldn't either. Kids dislike romance movies for the most part, and especially in such a plodding format. Simply, the movie was not made for them. So, who does that leave? Perhaps girls from 13.5 years to 14 years old and, perhaps, some Otakus who might prefer their love stories androgynous (and pretty).

The best part of the movie are the endless high-end illustrations that you can freeze and learn from, if you are an art student self-taught or otherwise.",1420934400,,798,4.659574468085107

3284711,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Even though this movie came out a few years ago, I just saw it about a year from this review. The film split into 3 short stories, but they are all connected. The film is a little bit longer than an hour, which in my opinion, is perfect for this movie.  I really love the cinematography in it, the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, and the sound fits the film perfectly. There is no action in this, but again, in my opinion, it does not have pacing issues, and the dialogue is very poetic. I really can't say much more about the movie, without spoiling it. Overall, the film is one of my favorites of all time and I recommend it to anyone who like realistic, romantic movies.

The box itself is pink and comes with the Blu-ray, and a small booklet that has interviews and some art. The Special features are: Makoto Shinkai's first film (Voices of a Distant Star), a 5 minute short called 'She and Her Cat', and an interview with Makoto Shinkai. The 2 movies have English dub and original Japanese, with subtitles. The short and the interview also have English subs. The film does play in my Blu-ray, which tells me that it's region A. The price is steep, and 'I think' it's because you're buying it from Japan, so it has the Japanese prices, but I could be wrong. I feel satisfied with my purchase and I hope this short review can help you decide whether to buy or not.",1415577600,5,1370,4.368627450980392
3284712,5,B0010TL6RQ,"For those of you who do not know what this anime is about.

5 centimeters per second is an anime that takes a very realistic look at relationships. Since I don't want to ruin the story for those who have not yet watched it, suffice it to say that in life we often get so attached to something that we end up missing a lot of amazing things....that is what 5 centimeters per second is about.

Animation wise this is probably going to be in the top echelon of anime artistry it is that beautiful. Makoto Shinkai and Comix Wave studios are renowned for their attention to detail and this bluray version definitely does the anime justice. The colour palette is vibrant and popping, scenery, character design are all top notch.

I own the dvd version of this movie and when I found out that there was a bluray version (by the way this bluray has the English dub and English subtitles) I knew I had to get it. The pink bluray case is just a nice touch that helps this movie stand out from the myriad of blue cases that are a norm with blurays.

The price might be more than what you might be willing to pay but keep in mind that this bluray set was only released in Japan and you are getting Eng sub and dub and that the quality of the video is definitely worth the price of admission.

Overall I'm more than happy with this movie being in my collection and I would recommend this movie for both anime veterans and newer fans, it is a very down to earth story, a very realistic look at life and relationships, almost brutally so, which for me makes it stand out from the sea of action and fanservice oriented animes that we get now a days.",1415491200,4,1633,4.254838709677419

The main character couldn't let go of the past even after all those years of not seeing his first love. Voices of a Distant Star makes more sense and invokes more powerful emotion for a shorter length of time.

The English voice acting was also rather cheesy in my opinion. The male voice isn't bad, but the female voice is too exaggerated and girly, kind of how an American girl who is rather fake about her personality speaks.",1394064000,,444,4.6923076923076925

3284720,2,B0010TL6RQ,"I didn't realize there were 2 different versions of this movie.  The one pictured here, which Bang Zoom did a new English dub for.  And the original, dubbed by ADV.  Just to show that I'm no Bang Zoom hater, and that this is an objective assessment, I usually really like their work.  I thought they did a great job with Haruhi Suzumiya's English translation.  But this one was abysmal... namely Akari.  She sounded robotic, almost like she was just reading the lines off a card with no frame of reference whatsoever as to what was actually taking place in the film.  It was unwatchable.  Err, rather... unlistenable.

The only saving grace was that there was a neat storyboard version in the extra features, showing original artwork in the storyboards along with the dialog.  That was neat.  It's for that reason alone that I plan on hanging onto this version, even though I've now purchased the (superior) ADV version as well.

So buyer beware.  I highly recommend the ADV version, which can be found on here at present time, but is becoming scarce, and as a result the price will inevitably become absurd.  In fact I saw that new copies now are over $100.  I got a used one in ""Like New"" condition for $45, without a scratch on the thing, and consider it a very good bargain.  No reprints of the ADV version are likely to be made, so grab the remaining few while you can.",1374451200,13,1374,4.524390243902439

3284722,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This is a beautiful story. Strangely enough, the first time I watched it I must admit I felt a tad disappointed. I found the tale a bit depressing and slow, and surprisingly short. But after several more viewings, 5 Centimeters Per Second really began to grow on me. Now I appreciate this fine anime as one of my favorites.

For starters, the animation itself is superb. Shinkai has a sense of realism that I haven't seen anywhere else. He knows how to capture everyday reality and yet somehow still imbue it with a magical quality all his own. Secondly, the story--divided into three parts--is simply a beautiful tale of love that most people will be able to relate to. No matter what your take on the ending, this is a subtle and emotional journey, driven by characters who are believable and for whom we feel empathy. Finally, I must say that the music for the end is perfect to the last note and delivers quite an emotional payoff.

So, while I can see how 5 Centimeters may not be everyone's cup of tea, I encourage you to check it out and spend some time getting to know this moving story. Since it's only an hour or so long, it actually invites repeated viewings. You may be surprised--and you may find that it rewards your patience, as it did mine.",1370304000,9,1256,4.4803493449781655

The art is incredibly done even the smallest details are almost perfect, and the soundtrack is beautiful. The story is very touching. There were several moments during the movie that made my heart pinch. By the time the credits began my face ached and I wanted to cry.
It is a compilation of 3 short stories totaling about an hour. The story is about Takaki and his love for his childhood friend Akari. As their lives move forward the distance between them grows until all they have is fond memories and old love letters. The second episode is about a classmate of Takaki's that also loves him. It is a very bitter sweet love story. The whole story is fantastic. You shouldn't hesitate to buy this movie.",1348272000,3,781,4.546099290780142
3284729,4,B0010TL6RQ,"Well let me start by saying that this is one of the premiere works of anime short story writing. It's not the typical romance film and takes a very different angle than what the typical viewer is probably used to but will still unfold into a great story that should have some impact in one way or another. Luckily, you do not have to be a hardcore anime viewer to enjoy this film. However at the same time, one of the first things you will probably notice is the animation which is Makoto Shinkai's hallmark. The animation is really one of a kind, and still maintains that title years later after it's release. I will throw a slight caution in that I have tried viewing this film with other people and it has been acutely hit or miss. So while I personally recommend it, I can't necessarily say everyone will find the same value to this film as I, or others, did. Tough film to rate because of this.

Tough film to find these days in it's original print, making it almost a collector's item, so Amazon had comparatively good pricing from many sellers.",1347753600,,1051,4.417525773195877

After seeing that first film of his, I wanted more (to say the least!). I tried to find ""5 Centimeters"" at the library, but no luck. So, I went on Amazon and decided to buy it.

3284735,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I watched this film today while taking a break from work, and enjoyed it immensely.  The film's most pleasing aspect, in my opinion, is the internal dialogue of the male character, Takaki, which was often rendered in highly poetic language (or at least my copy's translation was).  Animes often attempt poetic or philosophical dialogue and only end up sounding pretentious, or willfully obfuscatory.  These lines were beautiful, though, and crystal clear.  Probably one of the best films I've seen about growing apart, and definitely the most realistic.  Highlights include the extended train ride in Chapter 1, which is heartbreaking, and all of Chapter 2 (Cosmonaut).  The only aspect I didn't approve of was the long ending song, which I felt could have been instrumental or perhaps simply a cut to a black screen.  The ending itself (before the song begins) accomplishes all.  Five stars.",1339113600,,892,5.145833333333333
3284736,3,B0010TL6RQ,"I think such a claim is a tad bit presumptuous, though.  That said, ""5cm Per Seccond"" is a very interesting and still profound film with many layers of depth and meaning.

FOR INTERESTED AND CONCERNED FOLKS...
First, there isn't much to worry about in this film.  The language is tame and clean.  I don't remember cussing or provocative language.  I don't remember innuendos and there no instances of fan service or related material.  It is pretty clean.

MOVING ON...

Plot:
This film consists of 3 half-hour segments (I think they are referred to as ""stories"").  All three of which are independent yet connected.  The thing about this film, though is it really can't be described as a movie or a series.  Rather, it is best approached as a visual poem.  If poems became films...this is definitely one form it would take.  The theme is ""5cm Per Second""...the idea that, as a cherry blossom petal falls (5cm/second is it's average speed of falling), it makes many different and unexpected connections and path changes.  The same  with life - as we ""fall through time"", we often wind up in different paths than we originally predicted.  He expounds on this through focusing on the lives to 2 people.  An overarching situation exists for both of them, but not really a plot...instead, you see what happens in their lives at 3 different stages (the episodes).  Narratively speaking, it's not strong or existent in the usual sense, but that's not it's point anyways.

Visually:
It's stunning!  Very Very beautiful, actually.  The cover art is but a mere shadow of the beauty and realism depicted in the film.

Extras:
There are interviews of Makoto Shinkai (the director) and the Japanese cast.  This is particularly insightful and very interesting.  Adds to the dialogue that the show, itself, started.  Also, there is a ""making of"" montage.  This one I did not find as interesting (I prefer interviews and stuff).

ALL IN ALL...
This is a film that comes pretty close to being an ""art film"" rather than ""pure entertainment"".  But, though it is very beautiful, it was ultimately forgettable for me.  Still, the strange thing was it kept drawing you back to finish it.  Strange, huh?  Now, it did move my emotions in spots, but in the end I did not feel like I got too much out of it.  Actually, it left me depressed.  Up to this point, Shinkai's films kinda do that to you haha.  But even so, one cannot deny the love, care, and detail put into this film.  The music is beautiful...until the end credits.  And with it's strong emphasis on reality, this could have been performed live without losing anything.  Ultimately, you really need to be in the mood for a poem...you can't passively watch this one bit.  Also, the rating is ""pg"", but the thing is, this will fly above most kids.  The themes are what drive this work, and they are very mature ones, indeed (and very subtle).  Ultimately, I don't regret the purchase and it did give me some things to think about...but it's not a film I would ""hail"" or anything like that.  This is a film that will force sides...some will love it, some not as much.  For me, it just wasn't my taste.",1337558400,,3134,4.664835164835165
3284737,5,B0010TL6RQ,This is an anime that you really cannot find the proper words to explain why it is great. The best way to describe it would be a must buy and to keep it on top of your anime pile at all times because when you watch it you'll want to show all your friends who love anime. At least all the ones that watch anime that have a great deal of emotion and feeling. I suggest getting it and watching it over and over.,1335312000,,408,3.869047619047619
3284738,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This show is amazing.  It could be considered many things, but to sum it up, it is simply about life.  The different stages one goes through in life, the experiences, the emotional attachments, the happiness and the heartache.  I can relate to this show so much its kind of scary.  It really draws some strong parallels to my life.  I think every single person could relate to this film on some level, from the aspect of one of the characters if not all.  I kind of wished for a happier ending, but I guess thats why I feel this show is an accurate portrayal of life.  It doesnt always have a storybook ending.  In general I was left with a feeling of sadness.  The story itself is told exceptionally well and the animation is amazing.  I think it could stand to be a little longer.  The 3rd episode was very short.  I actually had to re-watch the 3rd episode to fully understand what was going on, because it moves fairly quickly, which I'm sure was done purposely.

3284740,4,B0010TL6RQ,"5 Centimeters Per Second is a 2007 anime by director Makoto Shinkai.  It tells the story, mainly, of Takaki and his path from a relationship in his early teens to the new one present day.  Spanning three short episodes, Shinkai masterfully weaves this content into a remarkable piece of work.  I just wish it had ended differently.

From the start, the art in this film was staggering - I fell in love instantly.  The colors are vibrant and the environments are stunningly accurate.  My wife is from Japan and she was marveling at how precise the designs actually were, especially the train stations.  I've spent some time in Tokyo myself and felt the same.  Visually, this movie is as great as I've seen and the time flew by because of it.  I was left wanting more.

5 Centimeters is also written well.  There's some poetry in what's being presented here and some of it is heartbreaking.  I picked up the movie without doing any research and was gifted with a script plotted surprisingly well.  Most of us have been fortunate to experience young love and nearly all of us have at least had the sort of crush depicted here.  The innocence of that took me back and I felt so warmly towards the first two episodes of the film because of it.

My only problem here, and it felt like a big one, was the way the film ended.  And I don't mean the storyline or art, these things are covered, but it was so abrupt and capitalized with what felt to me like too tacky and aggressive of a song.  I'm probably irking someone with this part but to break it down simply: I was lulled by this movie for nearly its entirety and had the rug pulled out from under me at the last minute.  The contrast was just too stark for me.  There was a soft, rolling group of emotions I was pulled over by the director and it felt good.  The movement was slow and sometimes sad but introspective and most certainly something to soak up.  Is this making sense?  I was addicted to the pace and the end felt rushed.  (I found out from my wife at the end of the film that the song was extremely popular in Japan at the time.  It's a reasonable explanation but still disappointing - the music chosen for the rest of the movie was perfect.  They didn't need a pop track.)

I guess part of the reason I moved from mainstream American cinema to independent and foreign films is because I'm tired of this sort of thing exactly.  It makes me overly sensitive, I'm sure.

Still, I will be watching for work out of Makoto Shinkai.  I'm reading things here and there where people have labeled him, ""the new Miyazaki"" but I'm not sure that's accurate.  Miyazaki is a whimsical fantasy writer and illustrator with an intimidating and unbelievably unique imagination.  Shinkai, though?  Judging from what I saw in this film, I'd guess that the man knows hurt and has figured out how to present it with real beauty.  THAT is exciting.

Sans the belching crescendo, I admire everything about this film and recommend adding it to your library.

Thank you for your time.

There are 3 mini stories, all linked together.

The way I see this movie is each story is about a different type of love.

Pure and Innocent Love.
Love that will never be returned.
And Love that is lost.

Makoto Shinkai has created a beautiful world with amazing art.  The visuals are fantastic, and the sounds are spot on.
Light shines through windows, reflecting off of surfaces, bells are given the Doppler effect.  At times you cannot help but feel that Makoto Shinkai is just showing off, because everything has been meticulously crafted.

The characters are incredibly introspective, speaking the million thoughts one would have when they are in love.  One cannot help but feel connected to at least one of the stories.
This is not a happy story, nor funny.  It is romantic, and tragic.

I don't much care for dubbing, but that's also available.  Extra features are nice, but not really needed since this animation can pretty much stand on its own.  It's better to let the viewers interpret on their own rather than having the cast members and directors drag on about their interpretation and intent behind the characters and themes (1 hour combined time to dissect this by the participants), but again, fan of this movie/animation may appreciate this nonetheless.

I was utterly caught up in the beauty and tragedy of the story and count it among one of the very best anime i have ever seen.

Shinkai has often been compared to Hayao Miyazaki as master of the anime medium. If referring to skill of presentation and artistry, the comparison is certainly apt. But the stories that Makoto Shinkai tells evoke the aesthetic quality of Yasunari Kawabata's novels - beauty that is at once delicately nuanced but that reaches deep down into the heart of human experience.

With this third installment, fans of Skinkai's earlier works (The Place Promised in our Early Days and Voices of a Distant Star) will see similar themes evoked in 5 Centimeters that have been polished by Shinkai's continue progress as an artist.",1302220800,16,1180,4.807881773399015
3284751,4,B0010TL6RQ,"Synopsis: Surreal in its beautiful visuals while showing a tale of heartbreaking reality, 5 Centimeters Per Second would be the perfect anime movie if not for a few mistakes in its direction.

Anime tends to indulge in over-the-top fantasy or science fiction or ""action"" tropes, and unfortunately this often comes at the price of the ""human element"" of storytelling. Makoto Shinkai averts this trend in his film 5 Centimeters Per Second, a work that contains almost otherworldly visuals while grounding itself in the real world, following the young Takaki Tohno through his journey of childhood romance and maturation.

5 Centimeters Per Second's visuals swell with richness - and not just in a superficial, overly-detailed eye-candy sense.  The scenes that contain Takaki and other characters portray their actions and emotions in a potent yet pure visual fashion without resorting to caricature, while the scenes absent humans are rife with metaphor.  The film's powerful visuals transform mundane everyday occurrences - such as riding a train or shopping in a convenience store - into absolute marvel, all while reinforcing recurring motifs that tie the various points of the story together.  5 Centimeters Per Second sits atop the vast world of anime visuals, not just for its beautiful scenes and animation but also for how effectively it uses them.

While Shinkai aces the visual aspects, his decisions in the other areas of film direction disappoint sometimes.  The choice of narration sticks out the most - it adds nothing that the visuals don't already show, but instead sours the subtlety of many scenes with ham-handed angst.  An example: Takaki looks at his watch and the schedule he drafted, and now seeing that he's  hours late he crumples up the sheet of paper.  What a perfect, fast, efficient way to show his disgust and frustration - no narration needed!  But then Takaki's internal monologue intrudes, proving redundant at best.  Another jarring example of a questionable directorial decision crops up in the second act of the film, where the story focuses on another character and her perspective of Takaki.  In the middle of following Kanae, the perspective leaps to Takaki in his room and without any compunction or subtlety his inner monologue proceeds to explain the metaphor of the rocket launch (a scene which occurs later).  Fortunately, Shinkai's directorial miscues don't go much further than that.  The slow pacing of the film accentuates Takaki's torturous delay-filled train ride in the first act and Kanae's hesitation in the second, creating a powerful emotional connection with the audience.  The third act moves quickly to show Takaki's adulthood - a quick glimpse of his life, work and relationship - before unveiling the most heart-wrenching of all story resolutions in all of anime.

Overall, 5 Centimeters Per Second comes closest to what might be the Casablanca of anime - a beautiful, bittersweet romance story that feels planted in reality.  Subtract the forceful narration and 5 Centimeters Per Second becomes nigh perfect.",1301961600,26,3067,5.224489795918367

Makoto Shinkai's animation and storytelling combined with Tenmon's musical composition really strikes at your emotions. Shinkai has been called the ""Next miyazaki"" and I have to agree and disagree at the same time. Shinkai is certainly a great director, on par with Miyazaki for sure. However, they both have different styles and their genres are noticeably different. Miyzaki focuses on fantasy and children's stories, Shinkai focuses on Sci-Fi and realist fiction. Although, Shinkai'S new movie, ""Children Who Chases Voices from Deep Below"" is really Miyazaki like. He probably has been listening to what people has been calling him. He does cite Miyazaki as one of his inspirations.

I would give this movie even more stars than available and hope they make a blu-ray edition, I would definitely get it. Beautiful artwork, beautiful story, and beautiful music. I suggest anyone who watched this to watch Shinkai's other movie ""A Place Promised in Our Early Days"" as well.

3284756,4,B0010TL6RQ,"It is indeed a very interesting movie, in the sense that although one might not like the ending, one still feels emotions stirred. Maybe it is sadness or maybe it is the over all sensation of being in love, whatever it is, the movie is effective in prompting it. I really liked this movie but must also say that Ocean Waves left me with a more optimistic and happy feeling.

I guess the reason why some people (I am) are deeply touch by this movie might be because they identify at some level with the feeling of ""silent love"" or unreciprocated love. However, I also think that Takaki as a young man might not be the ideal guy who deserves a fulfilling love life. It is fine to be an outsider or bohemian while in middle and high school, but as he was growing up and developing as a grown up, how come he was not able to develop significant friendships? Why didn't we see in the collage the happy parts of his life where he is indeed a well adapted young man with rowdy friends and healthy relationships with other females? Do we have to imagine he went through 10 years of constantly not being happy?

Maybe this movie indeed show us the difference between (some) boys and (most) girls, the way boys will always hold dear their first love and have it in high significance while girls will move along and enjoy fully the love that is offered by other suitors at different stages in life.

How appealing would an adult Akari find an unhappy and unsmiling adult Takaki? How compatible would have they been had they found each other? Was Takaki still 13 years old, emotionaly?

I would have enjoyed a ""typical ending"" of having them found each other and living happily ever after, but I also appreciate the emotions stirred by the real ending (can't always win). However, I would have enjoyed more a clearer signal that Takaki FINALLY puts it together and is able to be the happy, friendly young man that he should be. The smile Takaki cracks at the very end gives me hope, but I wished I could be sure. I wish him and his girlfriend good luck.",1273708800,,2041,4.420212765957447

3284758,5,B0010TL6RQ,"5 Centimeters Per Second is another lovely anime movie, only about 1 hour long, created by M. Shinkai and his company. It follows the love story of 2 children who grow attached because they both have allergies and feel different from the other kids in school, but they are separated in later grade school when the girl's parents move. For years they keep in touch by letters. As a young teen the boy rides the train to see his love in person in her hometown, and they spend a platonic night together. However, once the girl becomes an adult she falls in love with another person, leaving the young man listless and unsettled in the big city. There is a middle segment in the movie about another girl who falls in love with the boy, but he doesn't really seem to see her as a person, just someone to hang out with. Always his mind keeps drifting back to his old love and he clings to that relationship in his memory.

So in one hour you will be subjected to a lot of heartache and angst, but also you will enjoy great beauty and exquisite music in this film.

It's a crying shame ADV lost their license to carry this film in the States, so soon after it obtained it and put the film out on a very nice quality DVD. Now the DVD is almost impossible to find unless you have 100 dollars laying around for an OOP one. Be careful of rip offs and bootlegs with this title. Make sure the DVD you get is the ADV version, used. I did hear news about Shinkai wanting a redub of this film in English, which may have something to do with the fact the ADV license was pulled. Very frustrating, because the English dub is quite well done. I liked the voices very much. You can choose Japanese language too if you want, with English subs, but the English dub was just fine too.

Random pauses could be captured and framed every scene has been given the same care.

While most anime's depict extreme depictions of violence and romance, this movie breaks those barriers and gives the viewer a sobering look at an often ignored reality, which is the inevitably that life moves on, and the only thing constant is change.

One of the most refreshing things about this movie is the length - its clocks in at 62 min, just a tad over an hour. While most films tend to drag on and on, this one does not. Its broken down into three 22min chapters, and tells the story about a boy (Takaki) and girl (Akira) moving apart from each other - not by choice - but because of circumstances beyond there control. A friendship which starts in elementary school that is filled with happiness, hope, and security... is slowly torn apart by space and time. How does it all end? Does he eventually re-unite with Akira and they live happily ever after, does love and patience eventually pay off for Takaki, who desperatly believes that someday him and Akira will be together? Watch the movie and find out, after all, its only an hour. An hour well spent.

The technical aspects of the film are astonishing. This is not your typical anime, the level of color, crispness, and detail that goes into each scene is incredible. A must see in blu-ray.",1253145600,,1316,4.619658119658119
3284761,5,B0010TL6RQ,"As a fan of anime I've watched many anime movies but none have affected me as much as this film. I liked it so much I bought Shinkai's previous films to see more of his work.

5 Centimeters per Second: A Chain of Short Stories About Their Distance tells the inevitable tale of seperation, a story of how the people we meet, friends and lovers, whom we believe we'll know forever gradually drift apart.

The story is nothing short of magnificent. It involves two main characters Takaki and Akari who are both school children drawn together by the fact that they are both used to transfering, after Akari transfers to the school that Takaki attends. As they both enjoy being inside the school spending time in the library, they grow closer until they are essential in a relationship.

There friendship is brought to a sudden end when Akari is again forced to transfer and move all the way to Iwafune, leaving Takaki behind. The story continues from Takaki's perspective, picturing how the distance from his love affects him mentally and emotionally. His focus and attention is constantly looking towards some far distance place, thinking about Akari. Due to this his life deteriorates as he is unable to concentrate on anything close to him.

The animation is breathtaking thanks to the lighting and the backgrounds which are simply beautiful. The score also increases the effect that the movie has upon the viewer. The story is fresh and never cliche. Although plot progression seems slow, the story is just taking its time to truly demonstrate how a young boy is affected by the seperation from his best friend and first love. The viewer can empathise with his feelings as it is a sad inevitability in life.

As I could not gain this movie in the UK I downloaded the English dub off the internet, as I was so impressed with the film, I bought the original subtitled version from America (as it has not been released in the UK and the English dubbed costs to much to have posted overseas). I am pleased that I was able to support the official release so that Shinkai may be able to go and develop equally, and hopefully even better, touching animated stories about space, time and relationships.

3284763,3,B0010TL6RQ,"Every frame in this short feature is lush, delicate and extremely poetic. Common objects like chairs and cartons of chocolate milk seem to have some importance and element of poetry that contribute to these visual stanzas. The cramped horizontal camera frame is somehow opened up to make room for the broad and colorful scenery presented in this movie. You could press mute and still be engaged by the amazing artistry here.

In fact, I wish I had pressed the mute button...

The melodramatic and love soaked narration is so dripping with sappiness that this might have been better if it were a silent film. The writing tries way too hard at poetry and poignancy, and so you get heavy handed adjectives and words like ""shimmering"" and ""eternity"" popping up every chance they can get. The body language of the characters said more about love and loss than the story's laborious exposition. Especially story one, ""Cherry Blossoms."" Silence would have been the ideal frame for Takaki's lonely anxiety as he tries to connect with his distant friend. Instead we get diary diatribes distracting from the otherwise delicate imagery. This would have easily been a five star masterpiece had the narration been nixed. There are many clever shots that echo each other, and their brilliance is in their subtlety. Yet the same subtlety is thrown out the window when it comes time for the narratives.  None of the three story lines are so complex that minimal dialogue couldn't have cued us into the challenges and barriers faced by the characters.

3284764,5,B0010TL6RQ,"CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!!

When I say that the art rivals that of Miyazaki, I mean it. The detail and attention to expressions and the clothes, the backgrounds, every little object has detail that jumps out and further presses the film's theme of isolation.

Before I say what is good about this film. I have to note that the first Act is pretty cheesy in its dialogue (and maybe that's just the way it's translated). I, as an avid Anime watcher, always watch my films in the original language with subtitles and sometimes if I've seen the film enough, without them. The Japanese version is better because the characters are done as they were first intended. But the acting is incredible as well as believable.

Each moment passes slowly and then speeds past the characters, much like the Cherry Blossoms that fall.

This film is about the pain of never being able to get to the person you care about the most and being able to tell them how you feel. Even though you say it, sometimes the time you spend apart makes you isolated and confused.

The story comes in three Acts (or sections) the first is about Tono Takaki, a young boy (at the start of the film) who takes an interest in another girl, Araki, who is lonely and awkward like he is. After jumping in to drag her away from students who are writing insults about her on the chalk board, he is helplessly drawn to the idea that they are both connected in their fascination with falling Cherry Blossoms. But because both of their families continually move and they have to keep transferring far away- their attachment becomes strained in an almost strange obsession with an idea of a paradise where they'd stay in the same place forever. But time passes like the falling cherry blossoms and soon they move through each moment in life, becoming more distant.

The Second Act is about Takaki at his new school (as a high school student) and a girl who falls for him because he's a nice guy on the surface and doesn't seem to care how strange and indecisive she is. But, even when she finally comes up with the courage and volition to confess, she notices that Takaki was always staring off into the distance whenever he was with her. That he was the furthest thing from being connected to the people around him. An amazing short section that breaks the heart in its honest message.

The Third Act is Takaki as a young adult (in his twenties approximately) and how he's inexplicably distant and unhappy with his current job and life. He struggles to understand why he can't keep in contact with Araki the way he used to and why he didn't turn around and see her across the train track (this is a specific scene in the movie- watch to see what I'm talking about) as soon as the train passed quickly. The moment they realize they may be able to connected, one of them is gone.

Perhaps the confusing part of the film is the end montage of Takaki and Araki's life. It's hard to understand what is going on. But in essence it is about how both of them have moved on and never really reconnected because their lives dragged them apart. The growing up that happens in the montage-divides the line between an ideal of Takaki's and reality.

This strange trio of anecdotes in Takaki and Araki's lives expresses a number emotions and harsh acceptances when people grow up: That some people will accept that they didn't get what they wanted and others will hang on to the sparse moments of joy that they got falling from the sky even if it's only for five seconds.

Besides the fine lines and perfect quality in art, the story by itself is to heart wrenching, I could barely stand watching the third chapter without taking time to take it all in. I'm not going into detail about the story line, many other reviews about this movie give enough about it. However, as each chapter progresses you feel more torn apart on the inside. Even from a guy's perspective it was difficult to watch. It's a slow moving movie, filled with one-liner love statements. There's no action, no comedic parts, and there's hardly any character dialogue, except in the second chapter. However, the movie gives enough character development to get emotionally involved.

All-in-all, the movie's storyline carries you much farther than you could ever expect. And when you add fine detail to art, the end result is a synergistic bliss all rolled in to one. I recommend at least a box of tissues.",1221350400,2,1133,4.901041666666667
3284772,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Shinkai Makoto has been someone of a hero for me. Back in 2002, when he won the award as ""Most Valuable Newcomer"" at the Tokyo Anime Fair 21 for ""Voices of a Distant Star"", I was blown away by his work for creating a short animated film by himself using only a Power Mac 7600/120 computer and various consumer and professional design and animation software.

In 2005, he returned with another award winning film titled ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" and his third film ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" which hit theaters back in March 2007 was another award winner for ""Best Animated Film"" at the Asian Pacific Film Awards.

But what makes this film different from his previous work is simply amazing. The previous films were very good but ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" is just perfect!

From the screenplay, the animation, the music - everything in this film is just perfectly done, well-planned and there is no doubt about it, Shinkai Makoto is one of the most brilliant animators in the world. There is something about his way of thinking, his way of animation that people just fall in love with.

With this particular film, ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" is a film divided into three parts.

The first part titled ""EXTRACT"" features two friends, Toono Takaki and Shinohara Akari, both attend a new school (fourth grade) with each other.  They have the same class and they enjoy the same things.  As they grow older, both are very fond of each other but in many ways, have difficulty expressing their true feelings for each other. During junior high, Akari moved away and transferred to a new school in a town in the Tochigi Prefecture. The two kept in contact ala penpals through letters sent to each other quite often.

When Takaki's parents move towards a country area (Kagoshima Prefecture) near the ocean, their distance has increased. Both are still wanting so badly to see each other, wanting to communicate their emotions to each other but still have difficulty in doing so.  One year after Akari has moved away and a week before Takaki moves, they both agree to meet each other in Akari's hometown. What will happen when the two reunite?

For those wondering about the title.  From the initial starting scene of part one, the title is derived from Akari telling Takaki that a cherry blossom petal hits the ground in 5 centimeters per second.

The second part is titled ""COSMONAUT"". The story continues years later as we learn that Takaki lives in Tanegashima, an island that is used by the National Space Development Agency of Japan for rocket launches. Takaki plans for college and to return to Tokyo but in the meantime, his classmate Kanae has fallen in love with him. In fact, it's more like love at first sight.

She very much wants to tell him how she feels about him but as for Takaki, his mind seems to be somewhere else. In fact, he seems to be texting on his cell phone quite a bit? Who is he texting to? And will Kanae reveal her love to him?

It's very interesting to watch this second part and to see how Takaki has been since moving to a new area and how one yearns for the past.

The third part is titled ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" and without revealing too much of this final part of the film, the story revolves around Takaki who is now an adult possibly in his late 20's. Working for a company and his life has changed since his teenager days. All I can say is this final segment alone is just one awesomely, beautiful visual piece with the awesome music of Yamazaki Masayoshi's hit song ""One More Time, One More Chance"" and just how everything just fits.

The storyline for each three parts is definitely heartwrenching and there are words said by each character that one can just come away watching the film and just realize how touched they were.

GRAPHICS:

The film is presented in 1:71:1 and is presented in 16:9 anamorphic. For me, what was accomplished via background art, character design and just overall animation was just perfect. The staff traveled to various locations and took thousands of photos and within the year and a half of making this film, you can't help but just be amazed of how much was put into this film.

From various scenery, skylines and locations in Tokyo or somewhere in the country, you get not a few but MANY background art variations. The way the sky, the city or town, the hills, the snow, the trees, the vehicles, a building or buildings, indoors, you name it...they take you on one hell of a visual tour that just screams of awesome, beautiful backgrounds.

I am just amazed of how realistic the background art was done and even though Shinkai says that he and his team are not trying to reach realistic sceneries but more of a scenery that one has in their memory of, I'm just digging every aspect of it.

The character designs are just impressive. From the emotional standpoint of the characters, to breathing patterns, the flow of wind and how it affects the characters, was remarkably done well on this film as well.

SOUND:

For the Japanese audio, it's presented in 2.0 with English subtitles with encoding at 224kbps while the English dub is in 5.1 and encoded at 448kbps.

As for the voice acting, I primarily watched the version with the Japanese audio but also watched it in English. My only problem with the English dub is when the beginning scenes feature a junior high Takaki, he sounds no different from an older Takaki. While in the Japanese version, there is a difference and amazingly, even discussed further about that situation by Shinkai and the voice actors in the bonus features.

But it was pretty cool to watch both because in a way, the variety of emotions in Japanese and the English dub, there with each character is different and you can probably watch both versions and come away with something different emotion-wise but both voice acting are well done.

The fact that for the Japanese version, what these voice actors were able to accomplish for their first time voice acting and the direction that Shinkai and staff wanted to achieve was impressive and you learn all about the casting selection and his experience on the special feature interview.

As for music selection, I was impressed by the music used. When I heard LINDBERG's ""Kimi no Ichiban ni"" in the second episode, I realize that they put the time period at around 1996. I was surprised to hear LINDBERG but even moreso suprise to hear Yamazaki Masayoshi's hit song ""One More Time, One More Chance"" and how it was utilized for this film. Excellent!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

For the special features, I can't tell you how happy I was to have an in-depth interview with Shinkai Makoto on this DVD. The interview lasts around 36 or so minutes and Shinkai really shows us what was on his mind from the creation, finding locations, the voice acting, the man is quite meticulous in his planning and he knows what he wants and how to work with great people and work together.

Also, where the previous films, distance and speed were a focal point.  Although distance is involved, he wanted to show the speed of how things change within time and how he shows the changes in different time periods of the characters is impressive.

I actually was surprised to hear about the growth of the staff and how everyone worked at his apartment and how the apartment could not handle electricity-wise of all the computers used for the film. So, he rented another apartment for more of his staff nearby and how they all worked together. It's so amazing!

He's also so down to earth that even during the interview, his cat was walking around his office and that's something you just don't see in an interview. That was interesting to see.

And to make things even more special is similar to a Robert Rodriguez or even Quentin Tarentino DVD of them helping film fans understand how they shot certain scenes, on this DVD, Shinkai has no problems of showing his thoughts of a creation of an anime and will show you steps of how they accomplished certain scenes and the staff using Adobe Photoshop for the backgrounds and character designs. I was so happy to see them talk about this and I just wish there was so much more.

I really enjoyed how they would show the original photo of the scenery and then show the after animated version, especially adding snow and giving a wintery feel. That was cool to see!

Shinkai has definitely become a fan favorite because of what he was able to accomplish by himself with ""Voices of a Distant Star"" but his approach to creating an animated film is just so avant garde, unique and fresh that I'm just proud of him and his work and how he plans things out. Especially his mentality and his observance of people, especially on how he selected his voice actors.

Also included in the bonus feature is interviews with the Japanese voice cast and the challenges they faced (since for many of them, it was their first voice acting job) and more importantly what scenes touched them and how they reacted to the film after watching it.

These are lengthy interviews and was very happy to see this.

Last is ""THE MAKING OF 5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND MONTAGE"" features behind-the-scenes shots of Shinkai and staff but also a few shots used on location for the film.

I can't tell you how much I loved this film.  Shinkai achieved perfection with animation, background art, screenplay, voice acting and the music, everything is just amazing!

This is not a film that could be live-action but done in animated form and even animated, almost reaching realistic settings through the background art.  Shows the talent of Shinkai and his staff.  Absolutely awesome!

There are not many people who have achieved perfection but it's amazing how Shinkai Makoto has evolved from a guy working on his own to winning an award, to getting a second film and working with a staff and now, his third film and a DVD that just showcases his mindset and what he set out to accomplish.

This is one DVD that deserves an A+, 5 out of 5 stars and simply a must-buy!  Highly recommended!",1218153600,18,10022,4.645727221279004
3284773,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This movie was a masterpiece of gentle, unassuming perfection, delicately yet heartwrenchingly executed.  On so many levels, cinematographically, musically, and content-wise, the film captures the essence of futility within daily life, the harsh indifference of love and desire, the sadness that accumulates in the objects of our lives, and the inevitable estrangement between people who care for each other, due to the inexorable pull of time, chance, and distance.  Some scenes were indelible in their simplicity, i. e. the way mere objects can become haunting when observed from a detached viewpoint, or objects as ephemera; there were scenes which, for me, invoked a Hopper-esque aura, such as persons juxtaposed against the cold and overwhelming industrial landscapes, and the underlying sense of alienation inherent in our current society.  At the same time, the movie strikes one as being timeless, capturing the agonizing impatience and desperation of first loves and long distance relationships with a poetic, crystalline dialogue.  The director was boyishly charming, intelligent, and extremely well articulated, and his passion was all the more convincing being tempered with that most lovely and welcome Japanese air of modesty and humility.

3284775,4,B0010TL6RQ,"*While I normally don't post a review by replying to another one I thought it would be most productive to respond to Jonathan's negative criticisms of this film since most of my praise for it acts as a counterpoint to his critiques.*

Wanting Shinkai to be ""the next Miyazaki"" is placing unnecessary preconceptions and restraints on a director who is a unique artist and not like Miyazaki at all. Miyazaki has succeeded because he's made Eastern fairy tales and fantasy palatable to a Western audience to which these things are often foreign. His style lies more in the narrative than in the aesthetics (though he doesn't exactly skimp in that area). Shinkai in terms of style, form, content, aesthetic, focus, etc. is nothing like Miyazaki.

As for the so-called ""pacing problem"" I agreed wholly that Promised was badly paced. But Shinkai's problem is that he couldn't decide what to focus on and how to weave the narrative together. There are two solutions to this; you either maintain a tight control over the flow of the narrative and the characters within it, or you sacrifice narrative pacing for aesthetic pacing. That's what he's chosen to do with 5cm. So the claim that 5cm has bad pacing is completely incorrect. Shinkai is not going for narrative pacing here, but aesthetic pacing. This is a classic technique of Asian art. You can see it in classic Asian film such as Ozu, Mizoguchi, Hsiao-hsien, and Ming-liang. Shinkai achieves this through his minimal focus on narrative, ellipses, pillow shots, musical montages, etc.

As for the music, I also disagree and think this film is another leap forward for Shinkai. There are several views when it comes to the best application of music for film, but one I like is Kurosawa's view that music and film go best together when both pieces are missing something; when a piece of music is missing something or a scene is missing something. That way putting music and film together 'completes' the other. I agree in Shinkai's previous films the music was more individual, more distinguished. But I think his application of more 'passive' music in 5cm is much better. And I rather liked how the ending theme compliments the film that came before. It might not be as superficially pretty as other music Shinkai has used (I think it's quite beautiful, but tastes will differ), but I think it fits much better in the context of the film.

The complaint that this is just a gooey romance rehashed from Promised isn't really fair from someone who's not attempting to conjure up an original and ""surprising"" narrative. If anything, the film is attempting to get to the emotions associated with the story more than presenting the story itself. Or, put another way, the minimal narrative opens a window into a river of complex emotions associated with such a simplistic and common idea as a youthful romance. Yes, this film is just a variation on his last two, but to criticize Shinkai for that is unfair. Yasujiro Ozu, one of the greatest directors ever, often repeated simplistic storylines using the same actors with even the same character names but just in slightly different circumstances. He did this so as to illuminate a different emotion, aesthetic, or theme each time. And by slightly shifting the content around, his oeuvre forms a kind of Cubist art where you get to see the same thing from different angles.

Shinkai is doing the same thing by using the same basic idea and slightly manipulating it with each effort to get something different out of it. You can't really do this switching to a completely different story, because then the pattern is broken. You can not like this approach and claim that it's just the same thing over and over, but to do so is to miss the point badly. Shinkai has finally honed his style enough that he seems to be aware of this. When he began, I thought he would end up going the more Miyazaki route of making sci-fi, fantasy, romances that fit more into a Western mold. But I'm rather glad that he's gone the opposite route and taken his films in a direction that's much closer to classic Eastern art. Because afterall, we have a Miyazaki, why do we need another one? Especially when there aren't enough artists like Shinkai in anime.

But even more than his Asian predecessors, Shinkai's films have come to resemble those of the reclusive, enigmatic, American director/poet Terrence Malick. After watching 5cm I was actually reminded vividly of Malick's Days of Heaven, which also features a minimalistic narrative that's used as simply a means for momentum on which the breathtaking visual aesthetics take over. This results in film that's the visual equivalent of poetry, and 5cm does indeed play more like a visual tone poem than a narrative driven film.

With 5cm I humbly think that Shinkai has crafted his most complete film to date. A stunningly gorgeous film filled with a rich melancholic tone. The kind of film to watch on a rainy day in a relaxed mood. It's a quiet and graceful film, a humble chamber piece set to a minor key; the anime equivalent of a Schubert Lieder. The 4 star rating is only because as much as I like 5cm, I still think Shinkai is capable of even better.",1216166400,17,5181,4.769230769230769

He's been said to be on par with Disney, but that is a lie. Miyazaki is BETTER then Disney. So obviously I'm always skeptical to people comparing an up and coming director to Miyazaki.

I watched Shinkai's carrier with great interest from his debut film Voices of a Distant Star to this new film. His strong suits have always been animation and music. No anime director I've ever seen can create such beautiful animation as he, and few can combine such stunning and magnificent animation with just the right music to set the tone and take his viewers far away to walk the snow covered streets along side the characters. He's great at this, but for all that talent he also has a critical flaw to his style which makes his movies miss their full potential; he has no idea what pacing means. Being only 23 minutes long, Voices was paced very well and never had a dull moment, but the follow up Places, being full length, was paced so badly it made me want to skip large portions of the film so I could see some more beautiful landscaping. If the animation and music weren't so great, I doubt so many people would love that movie so much, even though I personally gave it 4 stars.

But now, with his third film, I expected him to have found away around that weakness and create a film that wasn't just visually beautiful, but also well paced as well. Well sorry, but he hasn't done it, and my patience with him is wearing thin. In this three part film Tonoo and Akari are best friends in grade school who spend all their free time with one another, but as they grow up they slowly drift apart, contacting one another at first through letters and then falling out of contact altogether. It is, surprise, surprise, another romance. This would not have been a problem if this new film didn't seem like a carbon copy of Voices and Places, especially places. Guy and girl fall in love at an early age, guy and girl drift apart as life goes on and they grow up, guy and girl never get over each other and miss the other, guy and girl sit awake in their rooms all night thinking about the other, guy and girl never see each other again. If you've seen Places you can pretty much see everything that's coming. There are no surprises here, just gooey romance.

It's a real disappointment to see an animator with so much promise get bogged down in these silly romances again and again and again. Voices was good, Places was as well, but Shinkai always tells the same exact story. Its not that he likes telling a certain kind of story, it's that he likes telling only ONE kind of story, every single time. Get a grip man; make something a little more original. Its bad enough that his pacing is so bad but why even bother making new movies when you're just going to tell old stories again and again and again? If this is all Shinkai has to offer then it's not worth my time seeing every film he comes up with.

The animation, as always, is brilliant. I just don't know how much more I can gush over his amazing art. I've been saying this since Voices, but his three films are THE BEST animated films I've ever seen, and I've seen my fair share. Unfortunately this film is missing something; the music. Both his previous films have amazing musical scores that made the film just that much better. I never fail to catch myself humming their main themes after watching them without even noticing. Well I'm not going to end up humming these tunes, that's for sure. For one thing there wasn't enough BGM to begin with, and what little there is was just a remix of old themes. But the biggest disappointment was the ending song. It's just not pretty; I'm sorry, but Japanese isn't the most beautiful language to listen to. The ending song was nowhere near beautiful, in fact I found myself turning the volume down and playing a song of my own instead.

So no, this is not the next Miyazaki, not even close if this film is any indication.

Tons of movies have been filmed, and books have been written, about the intensity of childhood friendships.  But the sad reality is that the majority of us slowly drift apart from most of the people who meant so much to us in school after graduation - and, more specifically, don't usually end up marrying the first people we fall in love with.  This trilogy of shorts is a study about how we handle that life transition.

The main character is Takaki, a nice young boy, but a little quieter and less rambunctious than most.  The fact that he suffers from allergies clinches his preference for taking lunchtime in the library instead of the schoolyard.  There he meets fellow allergy sufferer Akari, of like mind, and the two quickly become inseparable, at first best friends but eventually falling in love.

Bad news is on the horizon, however, as Akari tearfully calls Takaki to tell him that her dad's job requires a move, and they spend some last, final time together.  At first they keep in touch, but eventually the text messages dry up, then the calls and finally even letters.  After one final, desperate visit, it's painfully obvious that they're no longer what they used to be to eachother - and they probably won't ever see eachother again.

That they were too young for their relationship to withstand Akari's move and not seeing eachother regularly - something that can topple even adult relationships - comes as no surprise.  The question is, rather, whether Takaki will move on before he misses his next chance at love pining away for an experience that by definition he can never have again and is now water under the bridge.

With an ending that allows us to draw our own conclusion, and some of the most stunning animation I've ever seen in an anime, I would highly recommend this to anyone who's ever revisited their high school yearbook and wistfully wondered ""where are they now?""",1213228800,2,1982,4.746355685131196

3284782,5,B0010TL6RQ,"To start off, I am a fan of the medium known as anime. Been watching it for, lets see, 5 or 6 years now. Something like that. Anyhow, lately alot of the anime has started dulling out a bit, becoming more predictable and unentertaining. Some recent anime have been good but overall the overpopularity of alot of series that I've been wanting to watch has turned me off.

However, I didn't hear much about 5 Meters Per Second. I heard the title before but never knew what this film was about. Saw it on a shelf at Best Buy one day and said, ""Hey, I've heard this title before."", and bought it.

I'm truly impressed and definitely not disappointed in my purchase. I've never seen any of Shinkai Makoto's works before this and I do say, now I want to see his earlier works.

The story involving 2 simple yet somehow complex kids turned adults over a span of 3 short stories was amazing. The unpredictability of this film was uncanny to say the least. The art work alone in this film caused me at several points to say out loud, ""Wow!"". This film not only set the bar for the next films to be released by any studio or director, but definitely deserves to be up there with some of the greats like Akira and Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke). If you are a fan of those movies, a fan of anime, or just a fan of something interesting and want an anime movie that you can relate to on a deep personal level, this film is definitely one to watch. I think even people who don't watch anime, but love films, should watch this one.

I do have to address this little thing here about how on the cover of the DVD case, they mention how Shinkai is the next Miyazaki. Now I can't argue that Shinkai's movies are definitely up to par with Miyazaki, but since I have yet to see the first 2 films of Shinkai (this opinion is based solely on 5 Centimeters per Second), that both directors deal in seperate genres. I find Miyazaki's works to be more fantasy and/or nature oriented, while looking at Shinkai, I find Shinkai to do better in the real life-type situations like what happened between Shinohara and Tono in this film.

Again definitely one to own of any type of anime fan. A must see.",1211932800,5,2173,4.342364532019705
3284783,4,B0010TL6RQ,"Wow. This is a stunning and beautiful anime. Makoto Shinkai is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. He has a fascination with the theme of lovers who are separated by distances. Longing permeates this work, like in Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. This particular anime is about two kids who fall in love for the first time, and then are separated when their parents have to move. It's told with visuals that are totally amazing. Few other anime has ever matched the gorgeous visuals conjured by Shinkai in this anime. I love the attention to detail, every reflection of light and ripple of movement is lovingly depicted. Love the way he shows a train ride through the snow, or a sunrise. There are none of the fantastical elements seen in his earlier works, this one is more grounded in reality.

Perhaps it's this realism that results in the sad ending. I felt like the film ended at a point similar to the midway point of The Place Promised in Our Early Days. It felt incomplete. I wanted more. It's a reflection of how young love cannot last. Kind of like Kevin and Winnie in The Wonder Years. By the time you finish this hour long film, you have this terrible feeling of heartache and loneliness. I guess that's what he was going for. It's not a tear jerker like Grave of the Fireflies, but it has its own emotional power. The ending song is also not as strong as the song from The Place Promised in Our Early Days.

I guess, if you're bummed by the ending of this anime, the antidote is to watch The Place Promised in Our Early Days, which does have a happy ending.",1211673600,4,1615,4.434343434343434
3284784,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Absolutely Heart Breaking. I experienced a similar childhood which made me relate to all the characters so much more, this movie really felt REAL.
Shinkai put together a film that weaved the emotions of love, desperation, cruelty, despair, and then hope. Never did a animated film ever hit my heart as hard as this one did.

As an animator I always put Story>Art, but needless to say this animation in this film was purely amazing. Every scene was stunning with incredible detail. Thats what drew me to this movie, the superb scenery I saw in the trailer.

Definitely worth it.",1210636800,,577,4.76
3284785,5,B0010TL6RQ,I have watched this movie well over 10 times since I bought it because it is so good. The artwork is amazing and the story is so deep it is one of the best anime movies I have ever seen. The English dub isn't bad either I originally watched the movie in Japanese with English subtitles but whether you are a English dub fan or a Japanese dub fan you will not be disappointed with 5 Centimeters Per Second.,1209945600,2,405,4.139240506329114
3284786,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Anime wunderkind Makoto Shinkai has made quite a name for himself both in his native Japan and abroad. After erupting on the anime scene with his entirely self made Voices of a Distant Star, Shinkai was hailed as the next Miyazaki, and was given a massive budget to produce a full length feature. The result was The Place Promised in our Early Days, a film that despite great animation and art, squandered its awesome premise. Two years later Shinkai is back with 5 Centimeters Per Second. Told in three short films, 5 tells a personal tale about time, distance and speed. Takaki starts the first film as a junior high student who is involved in a long distance relationship with a girl named Akari. Of the three films, this one especially will tear you apart like no anime since Voices has. When it reaches its heartbreaking, soul shattering conclusion, your face will be red with tears.

The second film starts in Takaki's senior year of high school. There he is courted by the shy Kanae, who has fallen deeply in love with him. Of the three shorts, the animation in this one is simply unmatched. The scenes are so beautiful that you will find yourself pausing the film just to get a longer look at each of these gorgeous frames. I won't hesitate to call 5 the single most beautiful animated work I have ever experienced. The second film ends in a similarly crushing manner as the first. Be sure not to miss the line where Takaki explains who he is texting throughout the short. If nothing else in this film brings you to tears that moment will.

The final film is the weakest of the bunch. This short sees Takaki in his late twenties, completely empty and forlorn. We see Akari moving on with her life, getting married, but maybe still thinking of her first love. The short doesn't really have an ending as concrete as the others. You are left to wonder if Takaki will ever find happiness or if he will forever be lost in his past. The movie ends with a montage over a strange Japanese pop tune that works well enough. Some viewers will feel unsatisfied with the conclusion, but I agree with other critics who hail this ending as Shinkai's most mature yet. Still, fans may miss the expected final line of wisdom that has ended every Shinkai work since She and Her Cat.

They won't be able to miss any other Shinkai staples though, as they are all present here. The color palette here is still the best in anime. The lighting is mind boggling, the characters are a little awkward, and the actual animation even surpasses the work put into Place. Tenmon returns to score all three shorts, a train separates lovers at least three times, beautiful sunsets background heartfelt moments, cell phones and letters connect distant lovers, most of the film is told through monologues, and the themes of distance, time, and speed are all present. I can only hope Shinkai shows some variation in his films before these themes begin to turn stale. As it is, they are still fully effective here, although the train sequence is starting to get old.

Overall, fans of Shinkai will adore his latest work, while moviegoers of any sort will appreciate 5 as a masterwork of animation and a heartfelt story from one of Japan's greatest writer/directors.",1209686400,2,3235,4.640488656195463
3284787,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Makoto Shinkai's film ""5 centimeters per second"" is one of the most moving and satisfying anime films of recent memory. The themes of love, loss and the emotional and physical distances between people have been explored before in his two previous works ""Voices of a distant star"" and ""the place promised in our early years"" however this new film strips away all the sci-fi elements and presents a raw and moving slice-of-life tale.

Presented as 3 short films examining the same relationship over time I think that anyone that saw this film would be moved by one if not all the  characters in the story. Whether it be the urgency Takaki feels when he goes to visit Akari,the sadness Akari feels as she is separated from her love or the quiet rejection Kanea feels when she realizes that her feelings for Akari are not the same, everyone can relate to some feeling.

Shinkai's trademark visuals of course present and as usual they are lush, cinematic and always beautiful. His ability to take everyday places like trainstops, convenience stores and wide grassy fields and imbue them with a realistic yet dreamlike quality is amazing.

5 centimeters is an excellent film and worthy of being seen by a larger audience including viewers who may not watch anime. Absolutely stunning.",1209081600,7,1278,4.875576036866359
3284788,5,B0010TL6RQ,"I've been a Makoto Shinkai fan since his ""Voices of a Distant Star"", and enjoyed (although somewhat less) his ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"". I've always admired his distinctive drawing style, his breathtaking landscapes, the pacing of his stories, and the underlying musical scores he chooses.

This was no different for ""5 Centimeters per Second"", although the three-part story makes the plot seem discontinuous compared to his other works. However, I found on reflection that the story really was consistently examining the same theme throughout.

I thought the length of the entire movie appropriate (as I liked the compressed story telling of ""Voices"", but wasn't as happy with the slower unfolding of ""The Place Promised""). The movie kept good emotional tension during the entire piece.

I won't go much into plot, except to say it is a good if somewhat melancholy look at relationships as seen through time, nostalgic and bittersweet.  I've seen it in my own life - friendships and romances, left to the vagaries of time and tide, never quite leave us completely, and color our reflections of what was and what might have been.  Definitely worth a viewing if you get a chance.",1207785600,3,1191,4.994949494949495
3284789,5,B0010TL6RQ,"Five Centimeters per Second was an excellent film.  The animation quality surprised me, from watching trailers from nearly a year ago, I immediately realized how detailed some of the scenes will be, such as the little shop in 'Cosmonaut'.  The color quality too shocked me.  I don't mind that some of the character designs seem pretty familiar, after all, Miyazaki done the same thing several times.

The story is told in three wonderful stories.  In short, the way each story is told is like a beautiful poem being spoken by the imagination.  The way he added One More Time, One More Chance, a relatively well known song in Japan added a sense of realism.

Another thing I found enjoyable was noticing the connection with She and Her Cat to this movie by a cameo appearance by Chibi.

Perhaps it was ADV's troubles during spring that the packaging is so limited, either way the packaging is simple.  Single sided art, no insert, and a slightly anemic menu system.  The latter however can easily be set aside as the music and simplicity seems to add to the overall effect.

He is excellent at creating those poetic vignette moments.  I haven't seen anyone who is able to fit together such scenes so elegantly.  Perhaps the thing that makes his movies so easy to relate to is that the overall themes of loneliness, longing, and love are things we have all went through.  The way he pulls it off will always astound me.  I do hope that the novel version will make it's way to the states.",1207353600,3,1485,4.593155893536122
3284790,5,B0010TL6RQ,"This movie is great, and if you have seen any of Shinkai's movies before you will surely enjoy this one. Even though it's not really one movie, but three short stories, the animation is superb and the director does a marvelous job.

The only qualm I have is with the packaging. I read in another comment that there is not much inside, and I have to agree. Although I didn't expect much besides the movie, there isn't even a little paper on the inside left, which would normally have the scene selection or something. Instead, I have two identical papers which are Devil May Cry advertisements. It would have been nice to have something for the movie, but instead my only choices are to leave it blank, which would look somewhat weird, or to have an ad for an Xbox game which I have no interest in.

Regardless of the packaging, this movie is great and I recommend it to any anime fans and especially those who enjoy Miyazaki or Shinkai already.",1206921600,,944,4.482558139534884
3284791,4,B0010TL6RQ,"I love Shinkai and I loved the art and the stories, but that theme song at the end pretty well killed the mood for me.  I gather it has some significance to the Japanese audience, but as a gaijin, I just didn't get it.  I also love the interviews that Shinkai gives with his videos.  I gather it wasn't supposed to really have an ending (or even have a common plot), but I could have used a hint.",1206403200,,396,4.051282051282051

3284793,5,B0010TL6RQ,"After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, I finally got my hands on the domestic ADV Films copy of ""5 Centimeters per second."" (**Amazon shipped the order to me on March 19**).

Be it the original voice acting or the English dubs, this movie is a treat-fest. Both are done perfectly and should serve to excite fans of either one. I, however, prefer the Japanese voice acting; they are one of the best I have seen to date. Period.

The story is compelling and simply amazing. A love story between two childhood friends, Takaki and Akari, who stood up for each other only to be distanced by the harsh reality of surviving in the cruel world. The story is divided into three segments. Each segment is righteously different, and take a different approach to build up the story.

Another beauty to this title is the wonderful music. It isn't overwhelming, but not underwhelming either. A melodious piano being played in the background acts to compliment the romantic screenplay.

This month, 5 centimeters per second and Appleseed: Ex machina being released back to back, there is nothing more joyous to an otaku like myself.

You will be amazed at this ""Legendary anime"" (according to IGN.com:). According to the Japan Times (on the back of the DVD cover), Makoto Shinkai is hailed as the ""Next Miyazaki."" I am not that big of a Miyazaki fan, but if Shinkai continues to makes these Triple-A animes, then so be it.

Next, I am waiting for the Collector's Edition. I know it is on the way.",1206144000,4,1490,4.6679389312977095

8238513,2,B0010TL6RQ,"Very, very disappointing.  First off, it's barely over an hour.  Then it starts off very slowly and seems to start building to something.  Unfortunately it fails to deliver from a plot perspective.  It's entirely a movie about theme and emotion, but even then the ending is incoherent and disappointing.  Sorry to use that word again, but it's the best fit.  The movie is amazingly beautiful and technically excellent, but the plot is non-existent after the first half.  In the extras, the director describes how the project started as 10 short stories that were somewhat interconnected, but then they decided to make it into a movie based on three of the stories.  I don't know what was supposed to happen in the ""lost"" 7 stories, but perhaps it would have tied the stories together better.  If you can rent this or see it for cheap, go ahead, it's worth an hour.  But it's not worth owning.",1515801600,,892,4.696774193548387
