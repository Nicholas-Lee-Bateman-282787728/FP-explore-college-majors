3067154,1,B0011HOF52,"I agree with all the previous reviewers. The movie is a rip off.  Chapter 17 and 18 (this being the last one) are the same, so you do not see the ending. This is a real disappointment.  Ask a bit more so that you can pay attention to the quality of your product. This definitely does not endear your customers to you.",1229904000,,317,4.096774193548387
3067155,1,B0011HOF52,"Unbelieveable!  I expect heavy editing from telenovelas and am still able to enjoy them.  This product, however, is not just poorly edited.  It is completely missing any ending.  The synopsis on the package describes how brokenhearted, Belinda rises to the top in her profession, while Ricardo lives in a miserable marriage with her sister.  The DVDs in the package, however, end with Ricardo still dating both Belinda and her sister.  No resolution is in sight for any of the storylines.  Until another version is available, take a pass.",1220745600,,538,5.045454545454546

I think I'm going to hold off buying any more pre-order telenovelas until I see someone write a review, because this is a waste of time and money. Of course it was great until the end--missing the end!!!!",1214006400,2,330,4.426229508196721

I bought this Drama & we are disappointed, because it doesn't have ending. Don't buy it, this is another south of the border ripoff.

Para su informacion no compre este producto sin antes leer los comentarios aqui escrito, este drama no tiene final tal parece que esta gente no revisan sus productos antes de mandarlos al mercado.",1213660800,,461,6.557377049180328

The DVD is cut off and in the packet the last CD with the ending is not on it instead you see the previous chapter.  Don't waste your money buying this DVD because you won't get to see the end.

La telenovela, no tiene final. La grabacion del ultimo capitulo, no se encuentra el en DVD se vuelve a repetir el capitulo anterior.  No gaste su dinero porque no va poder ver el final de la novela.",1211932800,8,488,4.105263157894737
3067159,2,B0011HOF52,"This version of the series is an incomplete one cause the end is lacking!! There is no end to the story I think they just forgot to put it in!! The story ends when the aunt of Belinda begins to have feelings for her niece's boyfriend!! The story has many clichs seen in other telenovelas. The main actress, Mariana Torres, is not convincing as the young and innocent Belinda but the worst thing on this show is the double role of Gabriela Vergara as both Belinda's mom and aunt: No, they are not twins, there are more than 10 years difference between them! I think they wanted to reintroduce Vergara into the series after the death of Belinda's mom.

Ni se les ocurra comprar esta telenovela porque simple y sencillamente est incompleta!! La historia termina cuando el personaje de la ta de Belinda empieza a enamorarse del novio de sta y ya!! Los de TV Azteca estn siendo tan poco profesionales que todos sus DVDs estn saliendo el uno peor que el otro!! La actuacin de Mariana Torres como la joven e ingenua Belinda es poco convincente, pero lo peor de todo es el doble personaje de Gabriela Vergara como mam y ta de Belinda, hacindole creer al televidente que hay ms de 10 aos de diferencia entre ambas. Me parece que la productora quizo reintegrar a Vergara dentro de la historia luego de la muerte del personaje de la madre. Muchas situaciones antes vistas en innumerables telenovelas se vuelven a ver dentro de la trama de Belinda. No cometan el error de comprarla y eviten la adquisicin de cualquier producto de TV Azteca!",1211414400,,1528,4.576642335766423

Atormentada por el sombria secreta que esra desgarrando a su familia, Belinda se enamora del apuesto y encantador Ricardo, solo para descibrir que esta y esta comprometido con la hermana de ella. Destrozada, Belinda se entrega de lleno a su trabajo, y asciende hasta la cima de la industria de la publicidad. Pero su profesion no puede apagar los sentimientos que todavia alberga por Ricardo. este, ahora casado, se da cuenta del terrible error que cometio y esta dispuesto a hacer cualquier cosa por recuperar a Belinda.

Belinda is devastated by the death of her mother, but her troubles are only beginning in this popular telenovela. Already tormented by a dark secret that's tearing her family apart, Belinda falls for handsome, charming Ricardo only to discover he is already engaged to her sister. Brokenhearted, Belinda throws herself into her job, rising to the top of the advertising industry. But her work cannot diminish the feelings that she still has for the now-married Ricardo, who realizes what a horrendous mistake he has made and will do anything to get her back!",1366588800,,1206,4.97029702970297

8241912,5,B0011HOF52,"for some reason the manufacturers of this edition of Belinda decided to release the complete story as two seperate box sets, both of which I own. Their greatest mistake was in using the exact SAME PACKAGING ARTWORK FOR BOTH box set covers, though the number of disks in the two box sets is different __the second, completing the story, has fewer disks. Their other mistake was to use so much of the second box set (completing the story) as a re-cap of the storyline in the first set. What a disaster for such a  well done, telenovela (and I am not a fan of this genre's usual, over-the-top, use of mawkish melodrama).
The production company should have released Belinda's story as a 6 DVD set. It is likely that someone lost their job over this marketing disaster. Now, neither of the two seperate box sets will sell.",1246579200,4,817,4.557823129251701
8241913,2,B0011HOF52,"I wish I had read the previous reviews before buying this DVD! What a shock. My ""Belinda"" came with 4 DVD's, 16 hrs of story. I loved it n thought it was well edited but started getting suspicious that something was wrong while watching DVD # 4. I wondered how the rest of the story would be abbreviated in one last DVD!.....well....the producers of this DVD solved the problem by cheating the consumer....there is NO END to the story. It leaves u wondering what happened to all the different characters in the story. What an incredible rip-off. How is it possible that ""TV Azteca"", ""Image Entertainment"" & ""Cinevision International"" the producers of this DVD get away with it? This came out in 2006 n it should be re-called or they should put out a ""Belinda- Part # 2""!
I'm angry as can be! DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! :-(",1242259200,5,816,4.483221476510067
