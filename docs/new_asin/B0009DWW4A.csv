This program informs as well as entertains the would-be entrepreneur about the ins and outs of the business world today and what it takes to be successful in today's market place of ideas.",1185753600,,314,4.526315789473684
8059212,5,B0009DWW4A,"I like Tom Peters a lot, a raving fan, and somehow TP is my personal ""Guru"" that i have never have the opportunity to meet. I live in Indonesia, so there's very few chances i can see him perform. So this is a GREAT DVD that i enjoy very2 much. 45 minutes of great materials.

I have downloaded his powerpoint materials for the past few years and learn a lot from his website [...], and i am personally a public speaker. So I do learn a lot from his style and how he speaks. I appreciate his generousity to put all his ppt materials at his website.

One day TP seminars in Singapore cost you about 900 USD ( in USA about 400 USD per person for a day seminar), so this is relatively small investment that you can enjoy over and over again.

Most materials are in his books and ppt, so if you are looking at ""content"", you are better off buying the book, but if you want to ""taste"" the famous TP seminar, buy the DVD. It is a great experienece.
