7844560,4,6303364284,"Pleasant enough little Canadian horror/thriller. Not a ton of suspense or scares, but the totally sexed up psycho performance by Isabelle Meijas is a real treasure to watch. Plus, there's Sybil Danning.",1516838400,,202,5.34375
7844561,5,6303364284,"This is a must see little gem. Keep in mind that the sound is not great, and it looks like it may be SOV (shot on video). Its a very fun horror movie that gets pretty violent in parts. Wait till you see the scene that the cover photo refers to!",1508371200,3,244,3.803921568627451
7844562,4,6303364284,"In DAUGHTER OF DEATH (aka: Julie Darling- 1983), Harold Wilding (Anthony Franciosa- TENEBRE) and his wife Irene (Cindy Girling) are in conflict over their daughter, Julie (Isabelle Mejias). Harold spoils her, while Irene can't take any more of Julie's bad behavior. Irene wants her sent off to boarding school. Julie is a tad ""different"", seeming to enjoy the company of her pet boa constrictor more than human company, her interests include hunting and surgery. When it's decided to send her away to the school, mom takes the opportunity to get rid of the snake. Irene soon meets her maker, though Julie could have easily saved her life from a would-be rapist. Dad's initial reaction to the situation, along w/ his weak-as-water parenting, points to his being an insufferable wimp of the first order! For her part, Julie seems to have.... moved on. After about three and a half seconds, Harold's asking a new woman to marry him. Enter Susan (Sybill Danning- REFORM SCHOOL GIRLS), a widow w/ a young son named Dennis (Benjamin Schmoll). Julie is not thrilled. OK, she hates the whole idea! She looks at Dennis like an owl looks at a field-mouse. Dad, is as limply oblivious as ever. When Julie sneaks in to see Harold and Susan making love, things really get weird! Let's just say that Julie is a little too fond of dad! Needless to say, madness and murder are the result! DAUGHTER OF DEATH is a decent enough psycho-thriller. Nearly all of the twisted action is saved for the gonzo finale- the last 14 minutes. Trust me, it's worth the wait!...",1503792000,2,1545,4.768656716417911

7844564,3,6303364284,"There are brutal and absurd holes and scenes in this movie but the daughter is so cunningly insane and the first case of female Oedipus Complex that I've ever seen that it's worth watching.

Crazy movie with crazy middle and crazy ending.

Just ignore the 4 or 5 obviously absurd scenes and enjoy this movie.

To makes things even spookier, the movie is not far off from some true stories I have read regarding gals and guys this age.

Wonder what happens to the old noggin that makes it grow so wrongly in kids in an otherwise stable household.

ALSO...the gal on the cover ain't in the movie.",1487808000,6,594,4.462962962962963
7844565,4,6303364284,"Basically bought it because I enjoy movies where Sybil Danning is naked (which is essentially every movie she's ever been in). Not particularly scary, or even good, when you come right down to it. Then again, I am a Danning completist...someone not so inclined may not find much of interest here.",1205107200,5,296,4.823529411764706
