5312187,5,B009B0L4H8,"With the exception of the Wood Duck, on the east coast we see most ducks in the winter and don't often get a chance to see courtship behaviors. This film captured great footage of ducks such as the Ruddy and Green Teal along with the Hooded Merganser as they try to impress females. Entertaining and educational film.",1359331200,3,317,4.578947368421052
5312188,5,B009B0L4H8,"I originally began watching this on PBS because my brother is so involved with ducks but was quickly drawn in as a nature lover. The story begins with a hatching of ducklings high up in a tree. How they make it down to their mother and the pond is photographed in adorable detail. The story goes on from there to describe the habits and habitat of many different ducks accompanied by glorious photography. I bought this video to give to my brother since he missed the television screening. I am sure that even he, who knows everything about ducks, will enjoy this celebration of these beautiful creatures.",1358208000,2,605,4.663551401869159
5312189,5,B009B0L4H8,"I first saw this program on PBS and decided I wanted to
see it again and again.  I have already watched the DVD

5312190,5,B009B0L4H8,"I have not yet bought this documentary, but I have seen it on PBS. The title alone is worth the price of the DVD! In fact that is what caught my attention when I saw it advertised. My mother loves all things duck, so of course she had to watch it too. And is not just about wood ducks, although they are the featured species.

There are plenty of shots of cute little baby ducks swimming and eating and swimming and waddling and swimming. And of course the adult ducks are there too. My mother throughly enjoyed watching this. After I get over Christmas, I am thinking about buying this for her birthday. If I do I may revise my review, but only to add more details. I do recommend this 'duckumetary' for anyone who loves ducks.",1357689600,,728,4.313868613138686
5312191,5,B009B0L4H8,"Marvellous documentary from PBS looks at some of the many types of ducks in the world, exploring their point of view, their evolutionary enhancements, and their sense of social structure. Highly recommended.",1357171200,9,207,5.5
5312192,5,B009B0L4H8,"one of the best films of the entire life cycle of American Wood Ducks, the most colorful of the N American duck species. very well done, edited and with up-close footage of ducklings leaping from tall trees, the annual migration headache of waterfowl, and the courtship rituals of these beautiful birds.  great for science students, biology majors, birding clubs or natural history programs; Giamattis narration is subtly humorous and on point for the subject.",1356739200,14,460,5.216216216216216

5312196,3,B009B0L4H8,"Background music too loud, and narrator's voice too soft.  I missed a lot that was being said, and I have good hearing.  Beautiful filming.  When there was no background music it was great.",1452816000,,189,4.666666666666667
5312197,5,B009B0L4H8,"This is one of our all time favorite documentaries. It's very well produced and features fantastic videos of some of our favorite flying friends. I've watched this over 10 times and never get tired of it. How can you not say ""Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"" when you see the little ducks hatching and then bravely jumping from 70 feet in the air to fall harmlessly to the forest floor so they can join mom on the lake. It's so beautiful.

Highly recommended for bird lovers.",1450224000,,464,4.658536585365853
5312198,4,B009B0L4H8,Good Documentary - interesting and educational.  I saw it and then bought it for my grandson.  He watches it over and over.  He is also a duck hunter!,1449100800,,150,4.285714285714286

5312200,3,B009B0L4H8,"Yes, this really is a cute little documentary about ducks, filled with inevitable puns from the narrator, such as they are like ducks in the water or they are sitting ducks. All the action takes place at one lake just outside Duckburg and the main characters are wood ducks, although other species are featured, too. I admit that the ducklings (I suppose we could call them Junior Wood-ducks) aren't ugly. This self-styled duck-umentary deserves at least three stars. As they say, if it quacks like a duck, the sauce is good enough for the gander",1430438400,,546,4.757894736842105

5312209,5,B009B0L4H8,"Finally, a documentary that celebrates glorious, incredible ducks!  From jumping out of nests high up in trees at a day old, to diving underwater for fish, this film thoroughly covers these beautiful, surprising, and actually largely unknown creatures.  What makes it more amazing is how difficult it is to photograph these hunted birds to begin with.  As a photographer, I'd love to know how they managed to capture some of these spectacular shots!",1419897600,,449,5.123287671232877

5312213,5,B009B0L4H8,"I've seen this on PBS. Great DVD on Ducks. Not just North American ducks either. The Torrent Duck from South America is included too. As with all Nature productions, the cinematography is outstanding. Can't be beat. Glad I own this, you will be too!",1417046400,,249,4.681818181818182
5312214,5,B009B0L4H8,"There are so many colors in this documentary that one can not stop admiring the power of mother nature. Ducks are a versatile specie living on every part of planet earth with ease. For some ducks flying in the air at 100 MPH, even eagles are no catch in the air. During mating season, male ducks get distracted and jealous of another's duck display. Males ducks get so worked up that their frustrations spills over into violent abuse of the females. Ducks are one of few birds that suffer forced copulation. Although it may take a duck six weeks to fly in the air, ducks are born flyers in water from the get-go. Ducks are amazing specie, important to the eco-system and so playful. Well done, documented and narrated documentary full of beautiful colors. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1414281600,,776,4.671532846715328

5312220,4,B009B0L4H8,I enjoyed watching these birds from beginning to end of life cycle. Learned some things I didn't know. I like to play it at work for the seniors.,1395187200,,145,4.214285714285714
5312221,5,B009B0L4H8,"Great photography. Even if you are not a big waterfowl fan, it is an entertaining watch. And you will learn a thing or two about ducks that you never imagined.",1393286400,,159,4.333333333333333
5312222,2,B009B0L4H8,"I feel like this may be a trend with nature-themed programs on PBS, including the entire ""Nature"" series.

Compare this program with, say, the BBC David Attenborough ""Life of Birds"" 10-part series.  That series is quite old, and was meant for a general audience, more general than maybe the audience of ""Nature,"" but ""Life of Birds"" is less cheesy, has more real info and clearly explained facts and concepts of anatomy, biology, animal behavior, etc.

Like ""Duckumentary,"" ""Life of Birds"" also has some lame music tracks, but just to give you an idea, ""Life of Birds"" is a series of 10 episodes, and I never got really sick of the music.  For ""Duckumentary,"" I'm over it after 15 minutes.  WHY is there a music track over almost the entire program??  And, as another reviewer mentioned, why is the narration mixed so far below the music track??

I think this is part of the general settling for mediocrity in TV, and a trend to dumb down ""Nature,"" ""Nova,"" and other PBS mainstays.  If you want dumb nature, watch ""Discovery Channel.""  PBS is going to lose its niche if this trend continues.

The videography is great, but the program over all is far worse than ""Life of Birds"" which was filmed two decades ago in standard definition.  That's saying a lot.

Though, ""Life of Birds"" does have David Attenborough, and he, as is his genius, makes the audience connect so intimately with nature, in a way that this program fails to do.

Keep the same footage, add a brilliant host, shut off the music track for most of the show, and greatly add to the scientific discussion, and this would be a great program.",1391472000,3,1605,4.648936170212766

5312224,5,B009B0L4H8,this documentary is one of the few that does not show any of its stars being killed. They mention only a few babies survive but never show any of the ducks being killed. I am glad for that and was able to watch this film and feel good throughout. The photography is incredible. The colors are breathtaking and seeing ducks just being ducks was wonderful. I wish there was more films like this.,1385078400,11,393,4.397260273972603
5312225,5,B009B0L4H8,"I first saw this video when it was shown to a group by a local organization.  I had to go on line and find it for myself and for Christmas gifts.  If you like nature videos, I think you will like this.",1384905600,,201,3.761904761904762

5312229,5,B009B0L4H8,"This is an absolutely wonderful ""duckumentary.""  The photography is some of the best I have seen.

I don't typically collect DVDs, but after I saw this episode on TV, I absolutely had to have it. Since then I've watched it a number of times and have shown it to numerous friends -- there is no one who hasn't gushed about how good it is after they saw it!

8539044,5,B009B0L4H8,"This documentary is a joy to watch. It deals with varieties of ducks, how ancient the line is, what niches they take advantage of and how they specialize according to these niches.

I think of ducks as ""Renassaince birds"", they fly, they walk and they swim. Some would say they don't excel at any  of these by I'd argue they do at a hollistic view of life and its opportunities.

I'd only wish it lasted longer.",1466640000,,411,4.381578947368421
