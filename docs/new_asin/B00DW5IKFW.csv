For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, it's a 51 minute excerpt of ""Rocko Live"" (referred to as ""Wacky Delly"" Live 2012 on the complete series dvd). This was a live event in California in October 2012 which included Carlos Alazraqui (Rocko), Tom Kenny (Heffer), Mr. Lawrence (Filburt), Charlie Alder (Ed and Bev Bighead) with Joe Murray (creator of the series and voiced Ralph Bighead) and hosted by Rob Paulsen. They did a live read of the first act of Wacky Delly and they also discussed working on the show.",1375228800,5,1182,4.502325581395349

8598590,5,B00DW5IKFW,"This show, has always been in my opinion The original Spongebob. Half of the cast went on to work on spongebob four years after this season. Its to bad this show never got the legacy spongebob did. I remember watching it while i was growing up and my parents never knew what to think of it. Watching it now, i can see why this show is still hilarious because of everything that went over our heads! And This season, was the one the writers tried to clean it up, its not the choky chicken anymore its the chewy chicken. Some of my favorite episodes were With Friends Like These, Pranksters, Ed Good, Rocko Bad,  S.W.A.K., Turkey Time, and my favorite Rocko's Modern Life Episode Floundering Fathers, where the group debates who founded otown and heifer tells the craziest story and plus unlike other shout DVDs this one contains a bonus feature of the cast doing wecky dell live in 2012! Its to bad this show couldn't go on any longer but like Ren & Stimpy(Which i never liked) this show got the axe making room for some more Nick classics.",1396915200,,1039,4.468421052631579

8598592,4,B00DW5IKFW,"Hard to believe that it has been 20 years since Nickelodeon released the classic Rocko's Modern Life, and yet it stil has had a cult following with die hard original fans of the cartoon series all the way back to the 90's. The cartoon really was the balldropper of voices that led to other series like Tom Kenny who played Heffer who is better known for Spongebob Squarepants, and many others. The cartoon during its final season on Nickelodeon wasn't actually as strong of a farewell season as it could've been compared to the 3 other seasons. But nevertheless did bring out some really funny moments. Now that the final season is available on DVD, many die hard fans of the 90's will definitely want to take a second glimpse of what made the cartoon series so funny.

Rocko's Modern Life: The Final Season which took place in 1996 is not as strong as the other seasons showed with hilarious laughter, but actually showed some memorable moments for the wallaby from O-Town and his friends. There were some memorable episodes that were funny, Some of which were good including Tee'd Off, where Mr. Bighead is trying to lose a game of golf to impress his boss, but Heffer steps in, and makes sure he is playing a fair game, and Ed Good, Rocko Bad in which Rocko tries to make a fair campaign for the office of Dog Catcher, but Mr. Bighead follows in suit, and tries to make a scapegoated election campaign that works to hurt Rocko's run with the help of The Chameleon Brothers aide. There is also S.W.A.K., where Rocko is struck by the lovebug and has a crush on his mail carrier, a lady wallaby, but gets caught in the crossfire where a thoughtful, but silly Heffer fills in for her, and leads Rocko into a panic to try and get his secret admirer letter back. The shows have all been remastered to good quality, and are a great throwback to what good animation was, especially following up what the network brought earlier that decade with Ren & Stimpy & Doug.

All in all, if you are new to Rocko's Modern Life, it is a good buy, but I honestly recommend you get the first three seasons of the show first and then check this one out, especially because they were had much more hilarious moments that made you laugh your head off. Still, Rocko's Modern Life: The Final Season is worth checking out because it is a hilarious trip back in time to when Nickelodeon really had some great cartoons. The wallaby from O-Town had some great cartoons, but not definitivel for the final season, but get this if you're a classic fan of the series.

8598593,5,B00DW5IKFW,"I was concerned upon purchasing this product. As many frustratingly mentioned when the Complete Series released before the 4th Season did here quite a few were made, myself one, to wait even longer for this collection to reveal itself. I started collecting the single season releases and have been holding off on watching them until this fourth came out, and the photo concerned me! A black case??? The first three seasons had clear cases and great artwork! But alas! The 4th season did indeed come packaged in a Clear Case preserving the previous style of collectable case construction and artwork built upon in the first three season releases. To those collectors who may be as weary as I about the black case pictured, it appears to be merely a bad stock photo.",1384214400,2,764,4.795454545454546
