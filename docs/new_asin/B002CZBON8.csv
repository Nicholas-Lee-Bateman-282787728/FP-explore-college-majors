8364661,1,B002CZBON8,"I bought this for our retirement community library, but it was so poorly done that I felt I couldn't include it.  The photography was grainy and seemed faded, the background music was annoying, and nothing about it was worth watching.  It was a total waste of money.",1401753600,,266,4.638297872340425
8364662,5,B002CZBON8,"Overall,,,very good...Could be more views of natural Ireland....A bit too many ""urban"" scenes.....Scotland was a delight. Informative as well as entertaining",1379548800,2,157,6.523809523809524
8364663,2,B002CZBON8,"Although these DVDs are advertised as being just released, they were actually produced in 1997, so they are definitely not ""new.""  The color is faded out (nothing like the real Ireland!)and much of the information is dated.  Certainly not worth the price.",1254355200,13,255,5.0476190476190474
