8415062,5,B0043K8M5S,An awesome gem for anyone who's a fan of the Gurvitz Brothers or Ginger Baker. The picture and sound blew me away for the age of this live sound studio film. The band was in good spirits and it definitely shows in their playing! Snips is a very underrated singer and really blows the doors off of the place! So please don't hesitate it's worth every penny!,1412208000,2,356,4.3283582089552235
8415063,5,B0043K8M5S,"I have been a fan of Cream, Blind Faith but had not heard of Bakers band from the mid 1970s until I brought the DVD documentary of Ginger Baker last year Beware Of Mr. Baker. I have purchased several CDs and DVDs as a result of watching that film. One was the incredible performance in Africa with Kuti and the other is from a brief fragment of a performance with a group I had never heard of called Baker Gurvitz Army. The result is this amazing live in the studio performance in Germany from 1975.
From the first song to the last this is a brilliant concert well filmed and recorded. What is obvious is how much Ginger Baker is enjoying the show, he smiles throughout this show and at one touching moment he gets off the drums and comes up front to join in the vocals. He is also clearly drunk but this certainly does not affect his performance.
The Gurvitz brothers on guitar and bass are exceptional musicians and really make a great band with Ginger.
The music is a full on rock show with a bit of prog mixed in.
I highly recommend this fully enjoyable and exceptional musical journey with a band that missed my radar but have caught my attention now.",1401580800,,1156,4.356481481481482
8415064,5,B0043K8M5S,"If your a fan of Peter(Ginger) Baker and /or Cream you will want this. I have all 3 albums ""Baker Gurvitz Army"" made, and to have a live TV stuido viedo is unbelivable. This TV show is to help sell there 2nd album. There's cuts of course from their 1st album and of course from the 2nd album to come. The Gurvitz brother are remarkable musicans. I hope they find more of lost tapes like this!! In this show they have a keyboard player also,who isn't in the orginal group but he adds something different. I hope they find more lost tapes of  bands like Gino Vennalli, etc.",1376265600,,571,4.287037037037037
8415065,5,B0043K8M5S,Who knew someone would capture this on video. I got to see this band live twice. They were quite a band back in the day and this video is surprisingly good. Good sound as well. Looks like they were having a good time  too.,1362441600,2,222,4.045454545454546
8415066,5,B0043K8M5S,"This was when bga was at its best right when there second album was out. For a 1975 gig, the quality-sound,picture is excellent. Very surprised how well it looks and sounds.
A very talented group that should have stayed around longer. If your a bga fan or a rocker,you must get this. Yes its dated -check out the clothes and the singer is a bit weird but sings great. Gurvitz is a very underrated guitarist- his chops are amazing. Ginger Baker well what can i say = great drummer. Go get this dvd.",1337904000,4,497,4.354838709677419
8415067,4,B0043K8M5S,"I will start by saying I am a big Ginger Baker fan. The Baker Gurvitz Army put out 3 studio albums between 1974 and 1976. I bought them all on vinyl back then and again later on CD.This was a really good RocknRoll band. They even got some airplay on FM radio back in the day (believe it or not). In his recent autobiography Baker said they did some dates in the US supporting the Doobie Brothers. I wish I could have seen them (don't know how the Doobies could follow them). This DVD documents a performance recorded for German TV in 1975. Even though there is no audience the whole band play their asses off. They are also clearly having a good time as they smile and grin throughout the performance. There is not a bad cut here. ""Love Is"" is a rocking instrumental jam, Ginger does a great solo on ""Memory Lane"" and they even do a Jimi Hendrix cover on ""Freedom."" I will admit that one of my favorite cuts, the ballad ""The Gambler"" sounded better on the record but that still does not detract from the show as a whole. The only thing that might have made it better is if it had been released in Blu-Ray. Picture and sound quality are very good considering it was recorded almost 36 years ago. I don't know what the other reviewer's beef was.
I totally enjoyed this. Pick it up if you were ever a fan of the man, and crank it up loud.",1303603200,13,1335,4.21875
8415068,1,B0043K8M5S,"Being fan of the Baker Gurvitz Army I also bought this live CD. I am terribly disappointed. It is of outstanding poor recording quality and in addition, the band does not perform well. It seems Ginger tries to commercialize whatever was recorded completely independent of its quality. What a pity! This rubbish should never have been released.",1300838400,,343,5.035087719298246
