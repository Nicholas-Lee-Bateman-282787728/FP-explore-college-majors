3520252,2,B001CU7VK4,"Fans of the popular 1971 Broadway revival of this 1920's musical will be curious about this, the second filmed version(the 1930 one never urns up anywhere) It's fun to see Anna Neagle as Nanette even if she is a little long in the tooth..she later played the maid in the London revival in 1973. Eve Arden also appears but VERY few of the songs from the show made it into the film. And ths appears to be a film TAPED OFF OF TV as there are fadeouts where commercials once were!!!",1222905600,12,478,4.263736263736264
8290077,5,B001CU7VK4,"I didn't know this movie was even made.  I had hoped it contained more of the Broadway Musical music, but they did feature three songs:  No No Nanette, I Want To Be Happy, and Tea for Two.",1484611200,,188,4.054054054054054
8290078,1,B001CU7VK4,"I watched this film as an historical curiosity. It was my understanding that there were no copies left anywhere. Having heard this from rhe owner of Theatre 80 St. Marks, NYC, who had a large poster of No, No, Nanette over the bar of the theatre  It is very dated but it was good to see my childhood idol, Anna Neagle, once again.  She was  miscast as a young woman;Neagle would have been forty at the time.",1471305600,,407,4.259740259740259

8290080,3,B001CU7VK4,PRETTY ENTERTAINING MOVIE BUT VERY-VERY OLD....VIDEO NOT GREAT-SOUND NOT GREAT...STILL WORTH WATCHING.,1453593600,,102,7.583333333333333
8290081,4,B001CU7VK4,"Many old classics are just silly fun, like this one.  While the story is silly the actors are tops and it is enjoyable to watch them all.  Saw this on Amazon Prime and didn't experience any of the technical issues others commented on.  Just a cute old movie.",1437782400,,258,4.333333333333333
8290082,3,B001CU7VK4,"The ""cute"" older uncle who pissed away money on a variety of young women should hgave been beaten with a stick.  Poorly developed characters.  Pretty lame.",1425081600,,155,4.923076923076923
8290083,2,B001CU7VK4,"At the same time Alma and Alfred Hitchcock, a very cute couple, emigrated to America and a promising sweetheart contract with David O. Selznick, the senior producer-director Herbert Wilcox brought his proprietary superstar Anna Neagle to RKO to film three classic but dated Broadway shows, SUNNY, IRENE and NANETTE. The results were neither happy nor memorable. La Neagle in musical comedy is intriguing--a large-boned woman with very long dancer's limbs, accentuated in exceptionally unbecoming costumes and hairstyles that emphasize her maturity (the original 1925 Nanette was to be a teenybopper flapper). Miss Neagle eerily resembles another soubrette/flapper, Miss Joan Crawford, having a really bad hair and costume day.

The film was already hopelessly dated in 1940, creaky in its lumpen timing and enjoyable solely for the brilliant but largely wasted supporting cast, Roland Young, Eve Arden, Helen Broderick, ZaSu Pitts and Victor Mature. Neagle gamely skips (literally) through the film in best Stiff Upper Lip tradition but her ingenue days are far behind her, and there is far too little of her dancing (and too much skipping). Diehard Vincent Youmans fans are still seething that this film virtually throws away the two big hits ""I want to be happy"" and ""Tea for two,"" both severely cut and over before they've properly begun. Both should have been major production numbers in the Arthur Freed Metro manner, but this Anglicized take on an all-American, scintillating tapdance score all but jettisons the musical numbers in favor of lame and tame screwball matinee respectability and dignity.",1387497600,,1606,5.373015873015873
8290084,1,B001CU7VK4,"how can any of you say, "" a few songs from the ( 1970's)stage musical were tossed in this bad film""? Duh, the movie came first about 50 years before the revival in the 70's musical. BEFORE then there where many stage prodcutions of Nanette world wide in the 20's. As I'm sure with the original stage musical of the Wizard of Oz in the 20's, mnay songs came and went before the 70's stage hit. Infact, I think there where two badly made movies and on called Tea for Two with Doris Day, that just really using the show as a backstory with very few musical numbers from Nanette.",1374537600,,575,4.236363636363636
8290085,1,B001CU7VK4,"The QUALITY of this DVD os horrible. I own many classic movies and, in comparison, the picture and sound are very poor. While I did not expect a restored version, this copy is difficult to watch and substandard to most of the other classic movies - many going back to the 1920s and 1930s - that I own. I regret that I made this purchase.",1373846400,,337,4.2
8290086,5,B001CU7VK4,"I received the DVD of ""No No Nanette"" quickly and in top condition.  It was wonderful to view this black and white version and to share it with friends.  We had done a live theatre version several years ago and it was terrific to see the movie version and hear the familiar songs again.  I do wish the cover or the credits would have had more detail as to when the DVD was made and where it was filmed as well as more detail on the actors.",1347840000,,439,4.022988505747127
