1619338,3,B00005KAQJ,"Right away, you can tell that this movie is tying itself directly into the show that it's based on, so a little prior knowledge about the characters couldn't hurt.  Nevertheless, this was still a good film, offering a plot worthy of the cinema while staying consistent with what the show always presented.  I only ever caught a couple of episodes when I was channel-surfing, but as far as I can tell, ""consistent"" is an appropriate term here.  As the kids of Third Street Elementary School depart for summer break, Theodore Jasper ""T.J."" Detweiller learns that, among all of his friends, he will be home alone for the summer as the rest of the gang are off to various summer camps, which, as the movie later shows us, all seem to be in the same state or something.  Bored, T.J. happens to discover some unusual activity occurring at the supposedly-closed school building.  Convincing his principal, Peter Prickly to help him investigate, he instead witnesses the sudden disappearance of the man right in front of his eyes.  He, with the reluctant aide of his older sister, then rounds up his friends and ultimately proves to them that something is not right and they all decide to get to the bottom of it.  While this film is by no means deep, it has a good plot, enjoyable characters both old and new, and a well-structured outline of its story.  It's definitely worth watching for kids, especially fans of the show.  The villains may be a bit corny and over-the-top, but it's never overdone...again, the whole film remains consistent with the nature of the show as far as I can tell.  It's just a nice, fun flick.  Enjoy.",1403049600,3,1623,4.679577464788732

1619397,4,B00005KAQJ,"The review I first saw on this claimed that the TV show of Recess ""jumped the shark"" with this movie. In my opinion, although I prefer the ten-minute episodes, this movie isn't as bad as that. It's funny, creative, and entertaining. My main problem is that it is much less realistic than the TV show, with a simplistic villain, and a plot I'd expect from a ""Spy Kids"" movie.
I won't go into the plot. The main idea is that a jealous ex-principal wants to bring up test scores by making it impossible for kids to have fun outside, so they spend all their time inside studying - and they try to take summer vacation away to do so.
The characters are still the same people, with the main gang still having their tendency to get into trouble (specifically TJ), and while many of the antagonists from the show work with the other characters, they still have the same personality traits and quirks (ie: The Ashleys).
My main complaint with the movie is no fault of the movie itself, but rather my own opinion. I liked the TV shows because it gave endless possibilities to see the characters of the kids. The movie had to focus on action, and as such, it didn't spend much time on character, as the main audience would value action. My favourite character has always been Spinelli, and I just missed her for some reason, even though she was there as much as anyone else. Maybe I'm just blinded as a TJXSpinelli shipper.
OK. But overall, this is a decent (but underrated) movie. I wouldn't buy it at huge expense, but if it's going cheap, definitely worth it.",1368576000,,1551,4.4840989399293285

1619402,5,B00005KAQJ,"I remember growing up to TV shows like Recess, and being a kid it was only natural to gravitate to Recess - School's Out when it was released on VHS. I still own the original VHS and know its gotten some good use even as I grew older. I feel like spoiling anything would do an injustice to the strong impact that the movie has on your outlook not only on kids in school but the institution of school in general.

I can't recommend this enough for your children. They will laugh, cry, smile, frown, and learn so much from this movie and may one day say some good words about the movie when they grow older.

1619443,3,B00005KAQJ,"Haha, it's so cute watching this again!  While much of what was originally humorous was apparently lost on me,  I found much left to laugh about.  I did have some issues with the film though.  I thought the whole thing was...weird.  Of course, the premise was all unrealistic, but it's children's television, what can you expect?  I found it really bizarre though, that the kids recognized and took in stride the reminiscence. I know that when I was a kid, childhood went on forever, and had no end in sight.  That's not the kind of thing you realize while you're growing up, ""hey, I've only got a few more years left"", not at all, and this irritated me a lot, making me think the show-runners were going through a ""aww, childhood!"" patch in their own lives. Another irritation was the music--eugh.  Keep it out of Recess, please, the outside music.  Something like Green Tambourine, where it's Mikey singing it, the Mikey we know and love, that's perfectly awesome (and makes for the most epic end credits slash music video EVER.) but outside singers? *cringes*  The Flashbacks were awesome, too, all the old hippie stuff was just great, learning the backstory.

1619444,5,B00005KAQJ,"Recess is something of a misnomer. Despite it's ability to blend quickfire humour and morality it's success has fluctuated with the regularity of the recess bell itself. Yet the spirit of the show which follows the summer vacation's of TJ Detwieler and co. is once more enhanced by this, it's most recent DVD outing.

Whilst the kid's are at summer camp, TJ (or Teej) stumbles across a plot that will change recess forever. Now he must get the gang back together to thwart the plan.

The animation is certainly better than any Pokemon venture, but don't expect Pixar. The strength of Recess has always been in the dynamics between the kids and adults and this remains a potent mix here.

I would have to say that there are not a lot of the bonus features to speak of that you would normally find on a DVD:
The DVD contains a small brain teaser puzzle game that will amuse kids for about 10 minutes and once they finish with it, it will probably never be seen again.
The ""Animation Camp"" section sheds light on the process of bringing the movie to the big screen.
For those interested in trivia, the 10 things you didn't know about Recess will make you happy.
There is a short story book featuring the Recess gang which you can either read to yourself or have read to you.
The two music video clips wrap the bonus features up.
Buy this DVD for your kids but watch it with them because it has some really good music for us ""oldies"" to enjoy plus the whole thing is a bit of a laugh for the young at heart.",1035244800,,1054,4.023809523809524
1619480,5,B00005KAQJ,"I bought this movie for my ten year old son.  He finds it very entertaining and a lot of laughs.  All of the charactors that are present in the Saturday morning cartoon version are also present here including the always hilarious kindergarteners.  The themes here are all positive (good over evil, etc,) and parents need not worry about any the mixed integrity messages that are sent by so many other cartoons out today.  Pure enjoyment for the young and the young at heart!",1033948800,7,474,4.674698795180723
1619481,3,B00005KAQJ,I love recess and I enjoy watching the show with my son. We recently brought the movie and he really likes the movie but about the 10th time in a row he said Mom don't the Police helps when the bad guys are after you? I said yes he then asked so why did the laugh and not help TJ? I didn't have a straight answer for him. but I did work my my thourgh it. I just think Disney need to be more carefull with the message they are bring to different ages. I know a 10and olde child would understand but younger that that. But over I I like the movie however I can't rate this a 5 star in honor of my six year old who now ask 21 questions about Police all over again.,1026345600,,661,3.7971014492753623
1619482,5,B00005KAQJ,"Okay I am 17. And I actually enjoyed the movie. When my friend rented it, I kinda rolled my eyes and said whatever. But when we started watching it I couldn't believe how entertaining it was! The best characters I think were the little kids. The plot is kinda out there, and the villian is hilarious. Great movie which I think kids and the older crowd could both enjoy! Good music also brings out this movie's charm on it's audience.",1009843200,4,433,4.425
1619483,5,B00005KAQJ,"School has not let out on Recess yet! As T.J. and the rest of the gang team up to bring an evil experiment to a close.  Your children will love to go along for the journey and you will too.  This movie not only teaches kids to stand up for what they believe in, but it reminds adults to just believe in a way that only Disney magic can! Plus a brand new twist on the old favorite song ""Dancing in the Street"" sung by Radio Disney's own Myra! I can't wait for the Recess Christmas video ""Miracle on 3rd Street"" Due out in November!",999475200,,530,4.038095238095238
1619484,4,B00005KAQJ,"Good cartoon for the kids. Recess is one of about 5 or so cartoons that I like. Recess is a witty cartoon that even adults can sit through. I didn't like that this movie took place during summer vacation instead of during recess like it usually does. All of T.J.'s buddies go away to different summer camps, leaving him alone. These two factors combined minimize some of the great chemistry usually seen when the whole gang is hanging out. That said, I acknowledge that I'm an adult viewer.  What do I know? Kids will love this film just the same.",998956800,,547,4.47
1619485,1,B00005KAQJ,"I'm a fan of the Saterday morning cartoon, and reading the first few reviews I thought the movie would be great!  Sorry to say, I don't agree with anything that these people.
I showed it to some kids that follow the show and they were mad too.  the characters were out of line and the story was horrible.  The kids are not supper heros...they don't beatup bad guys or lead armies.  I wanted the movie, or be like, another episode.",997920000,3,430,4.3375
1619486,5,B00005KAQJ,"As Recess School's Out opens, it is the last day of school of the 3rd street kids. Tj Detwiler (Andy Lawerence) is sad to hear that his friends Vince, Mikey, Gretchen, Gus and Spineill are all heading off for vacious summer camps. And T.J is the only one not going to camp.
So the first few days of summer vacation, T.J sees a laser being shot out of his school. He tells his parents and they don't belive him. He tells the cops and they don't belive him. He even tells Princple Prickly. Prickly agress to search the school with T.J. but disappears. So T.J. gets his older sister to drive him to the cities his friends are. VInce (Ricky D'Shon), Mikey, (Jason Davis), Gretchen (Ashley Johnson), Gus (Courtland Mead) and Spineill thinks he is making it all up just to get them home.
But the problem is summer camp. T.J will get his sister to pick up at night and drive them back in the morning. Even his friends report the things going on and the cops don't believe them or a fat staff memember. They say they will report the case to Jackie Chan. And tells the staff memember to go home and take a rest. If you like this then check out the school kids if you haven't seen it or check this out if you have seen the show but not the movie.",997833600,,1236,4.219409282700422
1619487,5,B00005KAQJ,"The youngest member of my family was the only one who wanted to go and see this because he was a fan of the show. The whole family taged along and we all liked it! It was very funny! I have seen some of the show so I knew who the characters were, but my family who didn't loved it. It's summer vacation and the whole gang has gone away to different summer camps, except T.J. When he finds out that a mad scientist is out to rid the world of summertime, he has to gather his friends and and do whatever it takes to keep summer. Even team up with... his principal! Mrs. Finster definately steals the show with her sarcastic comedy lines like ""Curse these bodacious hips of mine""! Plus the special features! Myra's remake of the old motown hit ""Dancing in the Street"" is great! I'm so glad the music video is on this DVD!",996710400,12,818,4.1835443037974684
1619488,5,B00005KAQJ,"My husband, children, and I loved this movie.  I loved the political undertones: Don't take recess and summer vacation away, which many schools have already started to do.  The message of kids should enjoy being kids for as long as they can, something we have virtually taken away these days with year round school and no recess.  My husband loved the music and the humor.  My kids loved seeing their favorite saturday cartoon on the big screen.  And we all loved the story, the characters, the music... everything. I am preordering it today!!!",996451200,3,544,4.806451612903226

It never fails to entertain (even after 10+ years) The choice of music (Three Dog Night, The Human Beinz, Martha and the Vandellas) is superb as well. Highly recommended to comedy lovers old and young. Here's to hoping they put the original series out on DVD or Netflix soon!",1487721600,,404,4.328947368421052
