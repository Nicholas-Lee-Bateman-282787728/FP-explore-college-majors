8034521,5,B0002Y69SQ,I don't think this movie was meant to be taken serious. It is about a women named Susan that takes her former girlfriends camping for the weekend then they all start dropping off like flys. Make a Wish is a B- horror flick with a lot of bad acting but I it was hilarious. Major lesbian drama + bad acting = ENTERTAINMENT,1333238400,,320,4.17741935483871
8034522,2,B0002Y69SQ,"Make a Wish is essentially Friday the 13th with lesbians. Susan invites her exes who either cheated on or dumped her on a camping trip. Not exactly a wise move on the part of the dumpers. But it's Susans birthday so they go to help her blow out her candles and Make a Wish. One of the friends is a reformed lesbian who now has a male lover, but since she tongue kisses the other lesbians her reformation was short-lived as is soon her life. one hilarious scene shows two of the ""girls"" having a heavy make-out session in a tent. Outside that same tent she is flat as a pancake but once inside, in an artsy close-up  she suddenly makes Dolly Parton look flat-chested.

the kill scenes are fairly mild and hardly convincing but picture quality is pretty good since most of the scenes were shot in a woodsy setting on a bright sunny day.

Since the movie is really junk I gave it two stars just for the novelty of seeing a bunch of dykes hanging round a campfire hitching their jeans, having some brewskis, swearing like sailors just as one might expect a bunch of men would do.

Since the ""gals"" got their slasher movie I am awaiting the release of ""Cut My Throat on Brokeback Mountain"".",1157760000,5,1185,4.372727272727273
8034523,3,B0002Y69SQ,"I would have to say this is a good movie theme. The only thing that makes it bad is it is very independant film style so some of the horror scenes are a little cheezy! If hollywood would have made this film it would have had excellent reviews! There are a few different hot sex scences. The end leaves you guessing to, its like a puzzle.",1147305600,3,337,4.121212121212121
8034524,3,B0002Y69SQ,"This is lesbian drama to the extreme, and it's hilarious. Imagine a group of lesbian ex's and their current lovers going camping ofr a weekend. You all know the inevitable: drama! Only in ""Make a Wish"" the drama turns in to a murder mystery and campire chatter and steamy tent-hopping action leave not only broken hearts but disappearing people.

It's Susan's birthday, and she invites all of her exes and their girlfriends for an annual camping weekend. Attempting to leave behind inhibitions, jealous boyfriends, men in general, and heartbreaks of the past, the group ventures into the unknown -- the unknown woods and the unknown truth. And most of them never get out.

A mocking horror story of lesbian drama, you'll like it even if horror movies are not your thing. And you'll definitely laugh at some choice one-liners and at the undeniable possibility that dyke drama is really this crazy!",1123027200,4,896,4.927152317880795
8034525,1,B0002Y69SQ,"When you rent these types of B horror movies, you expect terrible sound, picture a special effects.  The picture and sound was actually way better than I expected, not typical of these types of movies. However, the FX where as cheesy as any other B-horror movie. I am beginning to think arrows are the weapon of choice in b-horror movies because it is easy to fake the puncture wounds. Oh, and add ""throat slashing"" to that same list. It seems very easy to for an actress to hold a handful of fake blood to their throat and pretend they are gasping for air. Anyway, you have some ""ok"" actresses mixed with a lot of bad actress, but none of them are great. You will read the movie, and think it might have that campy horror movie feeling, but it doesn't, this is about as scary as a Disney movie. You will never take it seriously enough to ever consider it a horror movie.. For those who rented this for the all girl concept: it is over done, mild, and stupid. Let me explain, there is too many ""make out"" scenes in this movie. These girls relationships with each other gets really old really fast. It gets to the point it takes away from the horror aspect of movie, and becomes a cheesy R rated skin flick. Just so you know, the ""make out"" scenes are mild. With an R rating, you get a toned down, kiss and touch type of movie. If this is really the reason why you rented this, then why not rent an adult movie? Finally, you are left with a cheesy over done plot and a generic slasher flick. It is slow paced and boring. Even though the quality of this movie surpassed my expectations, It still will not escape my one star rating.",1114473600,2,1629,4.288961038961039
