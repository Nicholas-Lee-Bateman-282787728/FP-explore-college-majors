2414736,5,B000BDH6GC,"This film had limited distribution when released and the HBO

video was not around long. The dvd is most welcome.  Alan Bates

portrays a shell shocked soldier during World War I.  His family

fears that if he gets his memory back his life will never be the

same.  Glenda Jackson portrays Margaret, his first love, and the

only person Bates remembers.  She gives one of her finest

performances.  In an ugly raincoat and an even uglier hat she still

manages to be more attractive than the beautifully coifed and

dressed Julie Christie who stars as Bates wife who wants him to

get his memory back.. Ann-Margret also turns in another fine

performance.  Many thanks to Trinity for putting this out on

DVD.",1130803200,34,709,4.680327868852459
8085607,5,B000BDH6GC,"Glenda Jackson is spellbinding. Alan Bates and Julie Christie are outstanding in this story of shell-shock, sadness, reconciliation and resolution. The authenticity of the costumes and scenery augment the almost mystical quality of the film.",1505865600,,241,5.914285714285715
8085608,4,B000BDH6GC,I have always liked Christie and Bates' work! This was not their best but it was good! I thought Ann-Margaret was really wonderful in the role of his sister.,1499558400,,157,4.448275862068965
8085609,4,B000BDH6GC,"Good movie, but the story is a little too didactic.  There's a touch of Ibsen here, without quite the impact.  It was great to see Bates and Christie together again.  They are a great pair.",1480982400,,189,4.3428571428571425
8085610,4,B000BDH6GC,"Excellent story, fine acting, but a bit disjointed in places. Well worth watching for Alan Bates' performance, Julie Christie also gives an outstanding performance, but the gold star goes to Glenda Jackson who is superb. A haunting story of PDSD World War I vintage.",1416614400,2,266,5.068181818181818
8085611,5,B000BDH6GC,This film explores the frailties of the emotions when war disturbs what is seemingly a pleasant and acceptable way of life. This soldier's return upsets the lives of all his family and an old love from the past. The ethical questions posed leave the viewer in the same dilemma as the participants.,1316476800,2,297,4.730769230769231
8085612,2,B000BDH6GC,"With several first rate actors and excellent filming, I was dismayed by the weak story and dialog, just not at all what I expected.  Julie Christie's character is too haughty and conceited (snarl, snarl, snarl, who would want to be around her for a minute, let alone be married to her?), and Glenda Jackson is quaintly dowdy but amazingly we are told this ordinary lower middle-class woman has a romantic history with our rich, shell-shocked hero.  In a nutshell, the story wasn't believable, and the script seemed to lack subtlety.  The sets, costumes, filming, and cast should have resulted in something fantastic, like a Merchant/Ivory film, but it didn't come off well, and the stilted dialog and uncomfortable acting were the kiss-off.  It's strange how so many terrific components would not add up.",1313884800,3,804,5.022556390977444

8085614,4,B000BDH6GC,"What a treat to discover this relatively unknown film starring the great Alan Bates, Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie, and a remarkable Ann Margaret, in one of her more subtle roles. The period ""between-the-wars"" is ripe for great story-telling, especially when adopted from novels. The adjustment of the ""Return of the Soldier"" is carried off well by Alan Bates. There is the unspoken feeling that things will end as they do in the film. The bittersweet sadness of regret and acceptance finally advance in such a way that it is felt more than stated. This is the quality that makes a film good in my opinion. The score by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett is excellent, and adds to the overall emotional feel of the film. Unfortunately, a full OST soundtrack CD was never made. The good news is that there is a compilation CD that has 8 tracks from the film. That CD is ""Love from a Stranger: Four British Film Scores"". It is reported that this little film did not do well at the box office in 1982, (due to a ""let-down"" ending) and hence fell into obscurity, but don't let that sway you. If you like English period pieces, this one is good enough for 'Masterpiece Theatre'.",1229904000,6,1166,4.610576923076923
8085615,4,B000BDH6GC,"Directed by Alan Bridges, this exquisite yet disturbing 1982 film which was not released in the USA until February, 1985, is a reasonably faithful adaptation (the screenplay is by Hugh Whitemore) of Dame Rebecca West's 1918 novel of the same name. This, West's first novel, has been adapted for the stage, too, by John van Druten, ten years after its first publication. West is known for a variety of other prose works (including critical studies of Henry James and D.H. Lawrence) and, of course, for her liaison and subsequent ten year long (1913-23) partnership with H.G. Wells, following the latter's partial disclosure of his libertine sexual views in his work `Marriage', 1912.

As far as the cast of the film is concerned, the hugely successful triumvirate of Alan Bates, Julie Christie and composer, Richard Rodney Bennett (yes, all key factors in John Schlesinger's 1967 remarkable adaptation of Thomas Hardy's `Far from the Madding Crowd') return here; fans of Bennett will be enthralled by the brooding, spell-binding soundtrack ferrying many of this composer's atmospheric hallmarks. This score conspires perfectly with the subtle, understated cinematography and with the poignant silences, which result from Bridges' admirably discrete direction of the film.

Each member of the cast is somewhere between competent and excellent; they all handle the delicate nature of their characterisation - and of the plot - rather well. It is in no way an action film; it explores the daunting filial, social and emotional implications of mentally paralysing brain damage inflicted by the most bloody and unjustifiable of conflicts; World War I. Emotional, class, and ethical issues become interwoven in an `inextricable whirl' of tensions, conflicts and values. The film will `speak' in different ways to different individuals, dependent, this reviewer suspects, upon each viewer's personal disposition and `conditioning'.

Alan Bates plays the aristocratic army officer, Chris, who has his memory `frozen' at a certain stage of his past through suffering a form of shellshock in the trenches, meaning that he no longer is able to either recall or even recognise his wife, Kitty, Julie Christie, but does vividly remember a previous fiance, Glenda Jackson, now a married teacher living humbly yet, apparently, also contentedly. The cast includes Ann-Margret, Frank Finlay and Jeremy Kemp.

Probably not a film to be watched whilst enduring a `night of the soul' experience, or the like, but a film which I can specifically recommend as a sensitive adaptation of a hugely challenging novel, well ahead of its time in 1918 and one which now, perhaps just as much as then, begs us to assess the real, tangible, and life-throttling cost of a `war with no reason'.
