1993447,4,B0001EFRWG,"""Pardon Us"" gets a bad rap from several critics and historians who consider the film incredibly padded. In actuality, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's first feature-length comedy holds up among their better efforts while retaining the hilarious spirit of the Hal Roach two-reelers. A 1931 prison spoof, ""Pardon Us"" benefits from its increased budget (the penitentiary sets are impressive), a fine supporting cast and some charming musical numbers  particularly Ollie's rendition of ""Lazy Moon."" The scene where Stan and Ollie maintain a cell-bound conversation in complete darkness has a bleak quality reminiscent of Samuel Beckett. As the thuggish ""Tiger,"" Walter Hall remains the quintessential L&H heavy. Though it's great to have the pre-release version, this DVD should have included the final theatrical cut.",1244332800,2,812,5.6016260162601625
1993448,3,B0001EFRWG,"L&H's Pardon Us was originally conceived as a typical 2 reel 20 minute short feature by Hal Roach studios, a spoof of MGM's The Big House.  Hal Roach had requested the use of MGM's prison set - MGM was the distributing agent for all of Hal Roach's product in 1931, back when MGM owned and operated all of their own Loews theaters - but for whatever reason, MGM refused.  Hal Roach, being the type A and stubborn personality that he was decided to build his own prison set, yet to recoup the costs of the massive set he needed to expand Pardon Us into a full length feature, which commanded a higher premium from MGM.

And therein lies the main problem with Pardon Us - it plays like a 20 minute episode with WAY too much padding in order to expand it to 64 minutes - 7 reels.  To compound the problem, this DVD does not come with individual chapters - the whole movie is one big chapter, so the viewer doesn't have the option of breaking the movie up into smaller portions for better digestion.  L&H's humor can get old after about 20 minutes, so to watch the whole 64 minute movie in one sitting can be tedious and tiresome.

L&H had the same problem with their second full length feature Pack Up Your Troubles (1932), but by their third, Sons of the Desert (1933), they seem to have gotten the formula right.

The print itself used in the DVD has NOT been digitized nor remastered, but is still a relatively clean print for a 77 year old film.  I don't suppose that there would be enough of a market for this DVD to support the costs involved with full restoration.  But as a L&H fan, I'll take what I can get.

In interviews, Stan Laurel often stated that the pacing of their sound era comedy films were deliberately slow to accomodate laughing audiences without drowning out dialogue in large movie theaters - the only medium their films were shown in during the late 1920s - mid 30s.  Stan also stated that he would have loved to have re-edited the L&H films for television to shorten the long dead pauses and lengthy reaction shots between dialogue and/or physical stunts (Stanley Laurel died in 1965, so he had viewed their work often on TV before his death).  Furthermore, Stan regreted that L&H ever made any full length features to begin with.  He acknowledged that L&H's humor works best in 20 minute short features.  I tend to agree.

L&H comedy is not like the faster pace of Columbia's The 3 Stooges - it's slow, deliberate, avoided cheap one liners, and has that warm Hal Roach charm.  Also, I really enjoy the background music from Leroy Shields and Marvin Hatley that were used in most of Hal Roach's product - more commonly known as ""Little Rascals music"" by today's audiences unfamiliar with other Hal Roach releases.

For the price of this DVD (worth about 4 gallons of gasoline) it's a good value for L&H fans.  For those unfamiliar with L&H product, it may be interesting and, in some spots, funny viewing.  Not the LOL type of humor, but a warm savoring with a few chuckles thrown in.",1202774400,,3007,4.48440366972477
1993449,4,B0001EFRWG,"It's kinda pointless to review Laurel and Hardy, except to say that this is the full 64 minutes of this feature, instead of the shortened version we used to get in the bad old days.

So, I'll review the disc. This is made by a small company, so it is on a DVD-R, but it is the only way you can get this movie on a DVD made for North America! (Foreign DVDs play at the wrong speed.) The film print they used is a good one, and it's a nice transfer to digital. Plus, the sound is full and rich. No need to shy away just because it's a small company that made it! This is worth it.",1202256000,,578,3.857142857142857
1993450,3,B0001EFRWG,"The majority of American Laurel & Hardy fans have first seen this feature in a grainy copy of a 55-minute American release that Blackhawk sold for years. When first released, the Hal Roach Studios was releasing alternate editions of their comedies to the foreign markets, usually in longer versions, with the stars themselves speaking the translated dialogue. Historians have found evidence of at least four or five variants of ""Pardon Us,"" including an extended version of ""Pardon Us"" that is the content of this DVD release. This appears to be the British release version with the American titles retained (in Britain this was ""Gaol Birds"").

In terms of structure, longer is not necessarily better. The movie is still what Laurel called a ""3-story building on a 1-story foundation."" It seems like three short subjects strung together with an arbitrary climax tossed into the final 10 minutes to wrap things up. However, many scenes in this release are longer, particularly the middle sequence on the cotton farm. The added minutes help the individual scenes, relieving the choppiness that has always seemed characteristic of this feature. And while the cotton farm scene slows the feature to a halt, the singing of the Etude Ethiopian Chorus, coupled with Stan & Ollie's song and dance routines, are a pleasant diversion, in spite of the dated imagery.

The overall pictoral quality on this release is about a 1000% improvement over the film prints I grew up with, but apart from the overall quality of the feature, for which I'm grateful, this disk is very lean. There are no chapter stops, no chapters of publicity material, no chapters of alternate scenes, some of which still exist. It would have been instructive to have the leaner American release on this or a second disk for sake of comparison. But like too many other American releases of Laurel & Hardy (and Little Rascals) comedies, we're getting the bare bones and little else.

But for the Laurel & Hardy fan, this movie is essential viewing. I hope it sells well enough to give the copyright owners incentive to be more ambitious with future releases.",1193443200,14,2118,4.96056338028169
1993451,5,B0001EFRWG,"Laurel & Hardy's first starring feature film ranks as one of their best. The boys have always fared best on stories with minimal plotting. No banal romantic subplots or musical numbers to intrude here; just pure Laurel & Hardy.
And the story idea is brilliant: Where else could Stan & Ollie create the most trouble? Why, in jail, of course! The running gag with Stan's loose tooth giving everyone the rasberry is a hoot. And the part with Stan & Ollie hiding away on a cotton farm (complete with ""black face"" disguises) after escaping prison is utterly charming. Not only is it presented with no painful Negro stereotypes (unlike those embarrassingly on display in the Marx Brothers' ""Day At The Races""), but it showcases Babe's beautiful singing voice, so natural & pleasant (with some eccentric dancing from Stan, too).
The DVD format has no extras--not even the usual scene selection menu--but no matter; this is a movie you can watch again & again. It's another stellar example of Stan & Ollie's memorable, disastrous encounters with public authorities...and another example of why they were such a great comedy team.",1183852800,4,1121,4.968085106382978
1993452,4,B0001EFRWG,"While the video and audio quality is very good, understand this is not a DVD but a DVD-R.  Most DVD players can play DVD-R. There are no extras on this disk and, like all other DVD-R's, there are no scene selections either. What you do get is vintage L & H (their first sound feature) and that makes the purchase worth it.",1142640000,11,322,4.193548387096774
1993453,4,B0001EFRWG,"This was the boys' first feature-length film, and it does show.  This film starts out really great, as the boys are arrested for being beer barons after Stan makes the mistake of selling some of their home-brewed beer to a police officer.  Stan also has a tooth that is bothering him, constantly buzzing when he speaks, which leads to a lot of understandable trouble throughout the film.  (Later on he's supposed to get it pulled, but in a scene that's a remake of their 1928 silent short 'Leave 'Em Laughing,' it's Ollie who ends up in the dentist's chair instead.)  One of their cell-mates turns out to be the feared Tiger, played by the great character actor Walter Long.  They're terrified to share a cell with him at first, but he instantly takes a liking to Stan because of the problems with his tooth.  Also appearing in prison is their long-time foil James Finlayson, who is the prison teacher in this movie.

Much of the film concerns their constant attempts to break out of prison, most of which fail.  However, at one memorable point they do manage to escape for awhile.  Stan is actually the one who has the idea for this one.  They don blackface and hide out at a cotton farm down the road from the prison.  Most sensitive modern people will be offended by anyone in blackface, although as hard as this may be to understand today, blackface wasn't always necessarily meant or presented in a racist way, the same way that the old vaudeville staple of dialect comedy wasn't always necessarily meant as a way of poking fun at other cultures.  Here we clearly see that they are only putting on blackface to escape recapture, and they blend in very well on this farm, singing, dancing, and picking cotton along with everyone else.  We know the boys don't have a mean vindictive bone in their bodies (and in real life they were very against racism and never understood racial prejudice).  This part of the film showcases their innocence; it's not as though they're hamming it up and ""acting"" Black, or doing anything the least untoward towards their new friends.  This part of the movie even allows Ollie to showcase his lovely singing voice.  However, this escape is short-lived, as the boys are discovered in this ruse when the prison warden drives up and has car trouble, during which time Stan's tooth gives him away.  They are promptly taken back to prison, where they inadvertently foil the Tiger's planned escape and are commended for their actions.  However, things don't stay rosy for them for long, since once again the tooth causes trouble!

Since this was their first feature, it can't be expected to be perfect.  At times it feels like a series of two-reelers that were strung together to make up the allotted time for a feature.  It's also not as tight on plot and structure as most of their features would later become.  However, even though it's no 'Chump at Oxford' or 'Way Out West,' it's not one of their worst or weakest films either.",1136764800,3,2961,4.664739884393064
8011124,5,B0001EFRWG,"Great condition and a quality box.  Watched the Pardon Us dvd (Laurel and Hardy), no flaws.  Thanks",1515110400,,99,4.764705882352941
8011125,3,B0001EFRWG,"In times presumably less civilized and more savage than our own, opposing armies about to be joined in battle would find ways to communicate with each other the night before the bloodshed, and exchange simple amenities:  Coffee beans, maybe, or sugar, tobacco, or bread.

Had this been done on a grander scalebetween generals, say, or kingsthis simple common decency couldve been called collusion, or consorting with the enemy, or even treason.  But on the forward lines, among the men who were about to spill their blood for reasons they often didn't even understand, it was just a way to pass the time and make life a little bit less miserable for a couple of hours.

I remembered this historical footnote the other night while I was watching the movie Pardon Us on an all-night TV station during a Laurel and Hardy festival they were running.  And while watching one particular scene in Pardon Us, I think I got a clue to the reason for the universal appeal and continuing popularity of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.

The comedy pairing of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy has achieved an iconic status in popular culture.  Like their contemporaries both real and imaginedCharlie Chaplin, King Kong, the Marxes, Frankenstein, and possibly Scarlett and RhettStan and Ollie inhabit the rarefied air otherwise occupied by heroes of folklore, while other comedy teams of that era, like Clark and McCullough, Wheeler and Woolsey, Olsen and Johnson, the Wieres, the Ritzes, and the female combination of Todd, Pitts, and Kelly, are mostly forgotten today, except by the most dogged, determined and devoted of movie fans.

Pardon Us was originally planned as another typical Laurel and Hardy two-reeler from the Hal Roach comedy factory, not to be particularly distinguished in quality from The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case, which preceded it, or Another Fine Mess, which followed it.  Originally entitled The Rap, Pardon Us was supposed to exploitlike their 1927 silent short The Second Hundred Yearsthe comic possibilities of Stan and Ollie in a prison.

Hal Roach had approached the larger MGM studios with a request to allow his production crew to film the Laurel and Hardy prison short on the sets constructed for the Wallace Beery prison drama The Big House, released on June 14, 1930.  And MGMs president, Louis B. Mayer, had magnanimously acquiesced to the request, for a price: MGM wanted, in return, to borrow the services of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as supporting players in an upcoming MGM feature, as the studio had done the previous year for The Rogue Song, a light opera fantasy piece produced by Irving Thalberg and directed by Lionel Barrymore, now considered lost.

Roach, for reasons which remain obscure, rejected the deal.  And instead of rescheduling production on The Rap and moving along to the production of another, different Laurel and Hardy short subject, Roach ordered the construction of a prison set on his own lot, at an expense such that the only way to recoup his investment would be to expand The Rap beyond its two-reel origin and film instead the first official Laurel and Hardy feature film.

While MGMs The Rogue Song had been filmed as a featurein the more expensive two-strip Technicolor process, no lessit had been a film vehicle showcasing MGMs investment in opera singer Lawrence Tibbott, and a moderately successful one at that, but not a film starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as the leading characters.

Certainly The Rogue Song was not an official Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy film, or one which relied on any creative participation from the comedians beyond their actual physical appearance and their personalities.  It is for that reason that Pardon Us is considered to be the first official Laurel and Hardy feature film.

Stan Laurel, for one, was sensitive to the notion of Laurel and Hardy abandoning even temporarily their short-subject origins for the expanded feature-length comedy format. Correctly or incorrectly, Laurel felt that it might be too much to ask for audiences in general and fans in particular to follow along for an hour or more of their nonsense.  As Laurel stated unpretentiously so many times during his later years while listening to plaudits and accolades extolling the comedy teams contributions to the art of motion picture comedy, I mean, we were just two-reel comics.  That wasn't art.

But producing The Rapsoon renamed Pardon Usas a feature would allow Roach to charge a higher licensing rate from film distribution companies, both across the country and around the world.  The popularity of Laurel and Hardy was international; since the advent of talking pictures, Stan and Ollie had been routinely filming alternate foreign language versions of many of their pictures, for release in Mexico and Canada, and throughout Europe

For Pardon Us, Laurel and Hardy stalwart JamesJimmyFinlayson was cast in his usual showcase role as the boys comic foil, displaying his distinctive and masterful double take and fade away, which Stan always got a kick out of.  Finlayson in this film played a schoolteacher performing social reform duties inside the prison.  Prolific, bald-pated character actor Walter Long landed a plum role as The Tiger, a hardened prison inmate whom at first antagonizes, and then befriends, Stan and Ollie.

Long, who strongly resembled popular character actor Lon Chaneyits easy to imagine Chaney, who died of throat cancer simultaneous to the Laurel and Hardy production, playing the Tiger role in Pardon Ushad himself appeared earlier that same year as Miles Archer, the ill-fated partner to Ricardo Cortez detective Sam Spade, in the original Warner Bros. film version of Dashiell Hammetts The Maltese Falcon, also known as Dangerous Female, co-starring Bebe Daniels and Dudley Digges (the doomed actress Thelma Todd, an occasional Laurel and Hardy co-star and a gifted comedienne in her own right, played Archers wife in the film).

Pardon Us began production during the middle summer of 1930, with James Parrottthe troubled, alcoholic brother of actor/director Charles Parrott, also a star of Hal Roach comedies under the name Charlie Chaseas the credited director and H.M. Walker credited as the dialogue writer.  It is likely, however, that Stan Laurels creative participation in the production extended beyond his credited acting, and into both writing and directing.  The production of Pardon Us continued through the summer of 1930, after which the picture was edited to a sleek 65 minutes and completed for an August 15, 1931 release.

In Pardon Us, Stan and Ollie are arrested and sent to prison for accidentally selling a cop a bottle of beer; this was during Prohibition, remember, as well as the Great Depression.  And eventually Laurel and Hardy escape their inadvertent incarceration by joining a group of sharecroppersAfrican-Americanspicking cotton in the fields surrounding the prison.

This scene is usually overlooked or dismissed in critical pieces detailing the career and films of Laurel and Hardy, but might be worth another brief glance, if only to examine the reasons for the enduring popularity of Stan and Ollie among people of all generations, nationalities, religions, and races, even for those among us who were born long after the deaths of the legendary comics.

During the scene, the African-American sharecroppers are portrayed in the stereotypical manner popular in American films of the 1930s:  Happy, simple folk, going about their duties with little thought, singing spiritual songs, contented with their lot, and smiling at each other a great deal.

Laurel and Hardy join the African-American sharecroppers and walk away from the prison by disguising themselves as African-American sharecroppers:  Donning worn bib overalls and straw hats and, courtesy of a conveniently-located mud patch, accidentally darkening their faces and hands.  But they in no way alter their screen personae: Laurel and Hardy are still Stan and Ollie, Fat and Skinny, Dumb and Dumber.

The comedians resist the temptation to condescend to racial stereotype or patronize their temporary new companions by intentionally attempting to imitate their actions or mannerisms.  And it takes a moment to sink in, but the denouement of the scenario is a whopper:

By not altering their customary mannerisms, Stan and Ollie fit right in with their new companions, in the process erasing the divisions of racial stereotypes, obliging the audience to look past the buffooneryaudiences in general were well aware that Laurel and Hardy were actors playing rolesand forcing the viewer to see both the white people and the black people depicted in the scene not as two racially-distinctive groups but as people.  Period.

And the scene continues:  After walking away from the prison in the company of the African-American sharecroppers, Laurel and Hardy are shown later that night, still darkened, still in the company of the Africans, sitting in front of a communal house and enjoying the evening:  Listening to the sounds, basking in the warmth of the night and the harmony of the music being performed on the porch. Stan and Ollie clearly are having the time of their lives, content with their easy camaraderie with their new friends, and they are in turn accepted among those new friends with warmth, and with no questions asked.

Ollie spontaneously joins in with the music by singing the early twentieth-century ballad Lazy Moon with his beautiful, and somewhat unexpected, tenor voice (Hardy had originally been a juvenile singer in minstrel shows and in vaudeville).  A quartet of sharecroppers contributes harmonic vocal accompaniment to Hardys lovely solo.  The easygoing performance of the musical number is surprising to the point of being literally delightful.  Later in the song, and just as spontaneously, Stanley stands up from his seat on the porch steps to contribute a ridiculous and absurd but still delicatelyelegantlygraceful soft-shoe dance.  Who knew?

Anyone whos seen Gone With the Wind knows how African-Americans were portrayed in Hollywood during the 1930s.  And the scenes with Laurel and Hardy in the company of the African-Americans in Pardon Uswhich was made eight years before Gone With the Windcould certainly be viewed as jaw-droppingly insensitive, politically incorrect, and flat out bizarre.  D.W. Griffiths The Birth of a Nation is still viewed with controversy, suspicion, and hostilityand rightfully soat this present time, nearly a full century after its original release, in 1915.

But theres nothing ugly about the scene in Pardon Us.  Its as innocent and lovely as the pastoral blind hermit scene in James Whales 1935 Bride of Frankenstein, but more relevant, I think, to both the 1930s and the present day.  Its as if Ollie and Stanley walk right up to an enormous chasm, look across it, realize the gulf is not so big after all, and smile it across to see if the people on the other side can see what they see:  That what separates us is not as unbridgeable as weve been led to believe.  The scene is innocent instead of ugly because Stan and Ollie are too childlike to be furtive.  They are not mocking their black companions; they are trying desperately hard to fit in.

I am quite satisfied with my job as a comedian, Stan Laurel would claim repeatedly over the years whenever asked by journalists or writers about his artistic ambitions and aspirations. Laurel doggedly insisted on remaining in his public lifeand his private life toopolitically unaffiliated and culturally neutral during times of swift changes, social upheavals, and reforms both politically- and racially-motivated.

Laurels more successful friend, former stage colleague and roommate, fellow Englishman and comic, and later--during the Laurel and Hardy comedy teams stint with United Artists--erstwhile employer Charlie Chaplin polarized America by wearing his political opinions and affiliations upon his sleeve as a nave badge of honor, and ultimately was hounded from his adopted American homeland and into European exile because of it.

In contrast, Stan Laurel was able to eventually retire with his customary grace and aplomb into a new role as a sort-of elder statesman of film comedy.  Laurel remained listed until the end of his life in the Santa Monica telephone directory, and his modest home remained open to friends the world over.  From the new, temporary kings of film, stage, and television comedyJerry Lewis tried for years to lure Laurel back to the movies, as a consultant to Lewis slapstick brand of humorto the most loyal and ardent of his fans, the children, the  world beat a path to Stanleys door, and that door always remained open.  While the more critically-acclaimed Chaplin grew to be hated and vilified in his lifetime, the populist Laurel remained loved by the entire world.

But Stan was also very much the child of his father. Laurels biographers tell us that while Stanley was apathetic at best toward that father for his treatment of his family domestically, he admired and tried to emulate him professionallyas a music hall showman, if not as an entrepreneurand idolized him for his social consciousness and his real concern for the less-fortunate people, particularly the children, in the repressed British coal-mining communities where he later opened and operated theatres.

Arthur Jefferson, Stans fatherLaurels real name was Stanley Jefferson; the name Stan Jefferson contains thirteen letters, and Stan was superstitiouswas noted for supplying shoes and socks to disadvantaged children and arranging special matinee performances for audiences who wouldnt otherwise be able to attend theatrical presentations. Jefferson also distributed luxuries such as packages of tobacco, sugar and tea to the adult patrons as they arrived.  His son watched and observed with genuine pride in his fathers decency.  As such, the adult Stanley was unlikely to attempt to elicit a laugh at the expense of social, or racial, repression.

Oliver Hardys social consciousnesses, and the reasons for them, are somewhat less obscure but no less compelling:  Self-described until his dying day as a proud son of the South, Oliver Hardyor Babe, as he was known to just about everyone who ever knew himleft his Georgia homeland in 1915 shortly after the brutal lynching there of businessman and factory owner Leo Frank.

Frank had been convicted on dubious evidence of the rape and murder of a young female employee, Mary Phagan, and sentenced to death. Georgia governor John Slaton, persuaded of at least a reasonable doubt in the matter of Franks guilt, commuted Franks sentence to life imprisonment, but a lynch mob attacked the prison farm where Frank was serving his sentence, kidnapped him, and hanged him from a tree.

Leo Frank had been a prominent member of the Atlanta Jewish community, and his murder is still considered to be among the most significant anti-Semitic events in American history.  Franks Atlanta trial had been national news and Oliver Hardy, at the time twenty-three years old and a resident of Atlanta, had surely been aware of it:  During that trial, Hardy had married his sweetheart, Madelyn Saloshin, a young Jewish woman, and Franks lynching death had taken place in the woods outside Milledgeville, Babe Hardys hometown.

Postcards depicting Leo Franks hangingwhich, along with the success of Griffiths The Birth of a Nation led to the national revival of the Ku Klux Klansold for years throughout Georgia and the American south, as did pieces of commemorative rope.  After the lynching, Babe Hardy and his wife Madelyn left Georgia forever.  Hardy never returned home.  He was not a racist or a bigot, and he was ashamed of his countrymen.

But for whatever the reason or reasons, the pastoral scenes depicting Laurel and Hardy in the company of the African-Americans in Pardon Us work beautifully:  For a few moments, everyones joined together, black and white, and they're making the best of what they have.  Their motives might differ after a fashion, but they're all joined together temporarily with the feeling of simple accomplishment in having gotten themselves through another miserable, rotten day with the company of their friends, old and new, and they all are still enjoying that company of friends well into the night.

The best of the Laurel and Hardy comediesand Pardon Us is usually not listed as one of themare about social injustice:  Stan and Ollie endure the slights, the petty hostilities, and the casual unfairnesses of mankind, and they always come back with smiles on their faces and a renewed sense of trust in the essential goodness of society as a whole; they are the eternal optimists in times of bitter pessimism, then and now, and now as then.

And if the African-Americans are portrayed in Pardon Us as simpletons and menial-laborers, they seem to be knowing and observant of the fact, while Laurel and Hardy are portrayed as nothing:  They just simply are childish fools and imbeciles, inferiors to people who know that theythemselvesare being treated as inferiors.  Pardon the grammar, but theres just no other way to express this as forcefully:  Nobody doesnt feel that way sometimes.

The African-American sharecroppers in Pardon Us are happy to be at peace that night among their families and friends, but Stan and Ollie are just happy to be anywhere they're not being picked on and hounded and kicked at and persecuted.  You get the real sense that theyll stay there forever if they're permitted to.  And if pickin cottons what it takes to get along in a world full of smart, or rich, or mean, or successful, or more intelligent, people, theyll start pickin cotton.  Happily.

While Laurel and Hardy mightve relied occasionally on a corny gag or a stale setup, there never was a low blow or a cheap joke:  Had the African-Americans in Pardon Us been simply and solely the basis for a quick, throwaway gag, the scene wouldve ended with the actual, physical escape from the prison, and wouldve left a bitter aftertaste. Genuine human affection continued the scene onto the porch steps.  And by association, it was that same sense of genuine human affection for mankind and the human comedy which carried Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy into the pantheon of folklore, where they reside to this day.

Tomorrow is still ahead, and it might be full of grief, and meannessprobably will bebut for an hour or so in Pardon Us everybodys friendly and happy, and they're all sharing their happiness with their friends and their loved ones.

Can there be anything better than that?

Afterword:  In a triumph of cinematic irony, fifteen years prior to the production of Pardon Us, co-star Walter Long had appeared, in blackface makeup, as Gus, the savage and uncivilized African-American villain who attempts to rape Mae Marshs virginal Flora Cameron in Griffiths landmark 1915 film The Birth of a Nation.  As an honorable alternative to forced interracial sexual congress at the hands of the freed slave, Flora leaps from a cliff to her death, setting into motion the series of events which lead to the eventual reemergence of reason and order at the hands of the masked and hooded saviors from the Ku Klux Klan.  Griffith's picture with its reprehensible depiction of African-Americans and veneration of the Ku Klux Klan remains a flashpoint of controversy to this day, more than a century after its original release.

The murder of Mary Phagan and the resulting Leo Frank trial are depicted in the 1937 film They Wont Forget, directed by Mervyn LeRoy.  The film is noted for being the famous sweater girl role which catapulted actress Lana Turner, in the Phagan role, to stardom.  The case was also the basis for the 1988 made-for-television movie The Murder of Mary Phagan, starring Jack Lemmon as Georgia governor John Slaton and Peter Gallagher as Leo Frank.  In 1998, the case was adapted by writer/musician Jason Robert Brown into a short-lived but Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Parade, which is still revived periodically.

As noted in the text of the article, during the early days of talking films, some of the higher-profile pictures were produced either simultaneously or back-to-back for French- or Spanish-speaking audiences overseas.  Frequently the same stars appeared in all versions of the film, but often there were exceptions.  In the French-language version of Pardon Us, entitled Sous les Verrous, the Walter Long role--""Le Tigre""--was performed by an ominous and glowering Boris Karloff, still a few months away from his breakthrough role in James Whale's Frankenstein.",1503792000,,20593,5.13750748951468

8011130,4,B0001EFRWG,Like another reviewer I'll take what I can get. Picture quality is very good on this dvd considering the movie's age. But why are there at least no chapter stops? Also I wonder are we getting the full uncut movie on this disc? I don't think so. The beginning of the movie raises this question immediately. Stan & Ollie are seen outside the malt & hops shop. They're discussing how many ingredients to buy & how much beer they can make with the cash they have. Stan says they can't drink that much but Ollie says they'll sell the rest. The next scene shows the boys in prison uniforms about to face the warden. Ollie is mad at Stan for selling a bottle of beer to a cop! Was a scene of Stan selling beer to a cop filmed & then cut? Obviously so! I have a number of Laurel & Hardy books. A few of them suggest some other scenes being cut as well. On the plus side the gags with Stan's bad tooth are very funny. The escape scene with Stan & Ollie in blackface is great too & handled nicely. Overall a very enjoyable film. Hope we get a few extras next time. For now I'll enjoy this copy again & again. Hope you do too.,1295740800,,1115,4.095890410958904
8011131,4,B0001EFRWG,"Pardon us was Stan & Ollie's 1st feature that was all their own. They run in to Walter Long [one of their best nemesis.]in prison. They ended up there due to Stan trying to sell home made beer during prohibition to a police officer who Stan thought was a street car conductor. Stan also has a loose tooth that makes a rasberry sound when he talks. They are an unlikely pair to be in the big house and they escape but not for long,if you are a Laurel & Hardy fan you love to add this to your collection",1280275200,,501,4.070707070707071

8011133,5,B0001EFRWG,"I bought this video basically for the beautiful rendition of ""Lazy Moon"" done by Oliver Hardy. This was Stan and Ollie's first full length film done around 1930. It does have an actual plot and many of the duo's gags but there is a deeper and darker historic value here. The scenes of ""Darkies"" and ""Pickaninnies"" in the cotton fields are terribly racist and show the lasting effects of the Civil War even 60 years after. It also shows the ignorance, even if excused by innocence, of filmmakers of the time. I can't blame Laurel and Hardy for their films and actions were accepted, applauded, and enjoyed by the filmgoing public. I've shown some scenes to my students who are appropriately appauled, thank goodness! Of course, it brings the question of ""Why?"" and it may lead to a question of what form Racism takes today.",1262044800,,822,4.675862068965517
