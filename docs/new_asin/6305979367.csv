It made me feel that it is my duty to inform the public of how atrocious it is. The acting of Daryl Hannah was pathetically dramatic. She gave the impression of a combination of helplessness and wanting to seduce everything that she was confronted with. Acting was dry. I felt bad for Clea DuVall. I pictured her thinking, ""Why am I doing this horrible movie."" The script was random and fake. Scenes that had absolutely no relevance appeared out of nowhere. There was some nice cinematography, but that doesn't make the film worth watching. Don't waste your time!",978912000,3,665,4.5966386554621845
1109997,5,6305979367,"WILDFLOWERS, a film by Melissa Painter, shown Sunday evening 7 August 2000 at the Wine Country Film Festival in Sonoma, California, made me feel like  living life more fully.
WILDFLOWERS is the story of a 17 year old child  of the 60s (she was raised first on a commune in Olema, then by her dad on  a Sausalito houseboat) who in 1985 befriends an expressive, artistic older  woman: one she sees as being everything she would want to be; one whom she  gradually suspects is the long-lost mother she grew up without. Clea DuVall  plays Cally, Daryl Hannah plays Sabine. The director/screenwriter drew on  her own experience - she was born in 1968 too - as well as interviews and  research. Filmed in Marin and North Beach.",965606400,8,721,4.622047244094488
1109998,4,6305979367,"Cali is a 17 year old girl that lives on a house boat with her hippie father, she searching for her mother who left soon after she was born. She  discovers that subeam the towns most ecentric person is her mother. Along  the way to finding this discovery she deals with her friends trying to  discourage her from finding her mother, and her need to live on her own. I  really liked this movie its vey artistic, and remnsent of hippies living on  communes. This is a movie to see on a rainy day. The setting is so gorgeus  you'll want to pick up and move.",965520000,10,554,4.179245283018868

1110020,2,6305979367,"Wildflowers is about 17-year-old Cally's search for her past.  She was raised on a commune by hippies in the 1960's (the movie is set in 1985), and now she lives with her father.  She's been told little about her mother, except that she had to leave Cally and her father because she got in trouble for her political activities.  Cally becomes convinced that the woman she meets in San Francisco (Daryl Hannah) is her mother, and she tries to become friends with the woman.  As she learns more about the woman and her father, she also begins to understand herself better.  The story is simple and straight forward, and the style and acting are extremely low-key. Although the movie is not great by any standards, it is fairly likeable.  Look fast for a quick appearance by Blue's Traveller.  Overall, a very average small-budget film.",1021334400,4,833,4.743055555555555
1110021,5,6305979367,This movie is one of the few done about the Counterculture of the 60's that gives an accurate feeling both of some of the people of that era nearly 20 years later and of the era itself. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand something of the 60's.,1018224000,4,262,4.26
1110022,3,6305979367,"Daryl Hannah and Clea Duvall were beautifully cast in a good intentioned story...but the script was lacking and predictable.
The shots were dreamily executed...so I'm giving it 3 stars. If Eric Roberts weren't in it and I had to think a little more, I'd have given it 4.5 stars. Eric Roberts TRUELY gives me the creeps!
Buy this used...or don't buy it at all.",1015027200,,359,4.625
1110023,2,6305979367,"I just saw this movie last night and was captivated enough to stay up until midnight on a weekday.  It was visually beautiful, so much so that it's almost a fantasy.  People live on boats, have gorgeous furniture and willowy, gauzy clothing, hang out in coffee shops, read poems in an eclectic bookstore and don't seem to have real jobs, responsibilities or school.  Clea DuVall is excellent but as a 17 year-old you would think her dad might be more worried when she stays out all night and doesn't come home for days.  No one else mentioned that Eric Roberts (who is gorgeous and about 20+yrs. older than her) has an intimate encounter w/her - did this bother anyone else but me?  This is one of those movies you get lost in because it's so wonderfully unrealistic and you dream about life being that carefree and beautiful...then the dog barks, the phone rings, your kids start fighting, etc.  Why can't we all sleep on the ocean beach, hike in beautiful deserted pastures in CA, sleep with gorgeous older men, have a fascinating hip mom to get drunk with?  It kind of left me unsatisfied with my existence, but that's another story...",1013644800,10,1138,4.6318407960199
1110024,2,6305979367,"i was excited to see this movie because i'm a fan of clea duvall. her performances in girl, interrupted and but i'm a cheerleader were wonderful. but this movie lacked something. or maybe some things would be more accurate. it seemed like a predictable storyline was taken and then a bunch of random odds and ends were thrown in to ""complicate"" the story and give it meaning. however, these scenes and pieces of information merely served as useless and annoying deviations from an already dull movie. the cinematograpy was good, but it didn't make up for the movie's shortcomings.",1009929600,,580,4.8686868686868685
1110025,4,6305979367,"This story tells the friendship between 2 women - one young tomboy-ish girl and an older beautiful woman.  The story leads to very predictable places, but Clea DuVall and Darryl Hannah are each absolutely stunning.  A fan (more of an obsessor) of Clea DuVall, I HAD to have this film - and it is FAR better than the Astronaut's Wife or Little Witches - but not nearly as good as Girl, Interrupted or But I'm a Cheerleader.
I'd only recommend this to people who want to watch acting, and don't need a very interesting story.",1003968000,,523,4.494736842105263
1110026,2,6305979367,"This film gave me the feeling that it could have been both good and interesting if it had beendone by someone with a pulse.  The acting talent is there and the story seemed like it could have been interesting, but this film is slow and boring.  Each scene seems to go on endlessly.  Each plot point is unendingly belabored.  There are numerous inexplicable scenes which only serve to muddle up the story line further.  By the time the film moves from one plot point to another you've nearly forgotten what came before.  This film left me scratching my head trying to figure out what happened.  Completely forgettable.  Forget it.",1001980800,,629,4.706422018348624
1110027,4,6305979367,"Okay, this movie was slow, even boring at times, and the sex scenes were kind of pathetic, but if you are into cinematography, believe me, ""Wildflowers"" would have won an Oscar for it. If you are a Daryl Hannah fan, don't worry, she's prettier than ever. And if you are curious about Clea DuVall, well, she's proven all her potentials for stardom in this movie. So, 2 stars go to the Bay Area beauties, 1 to Daryl and 1 to Clea.",991353600,3,428,4.296296296296297
1110028,1,6305979367,"I went out and bought this video based on reviews I'd read here and was overwhelmingly disappointed. I painfully sat through this entire movie waiting, hoping, praying for something interesting to happen, but unfortunately, IT NEVER DID. It started out slow and pretty much dragged on at the same pace thoughout. The characters were boring and devoid of any real substance. The interaction between Clea DuVall(Cally) who by the way was great in ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" and Daryl Hannah(Sabine), was confusing as to what the real attraction was between them, so instead you got a lot of mindless dialogue. I love Daryl Hannah and I thought Eric Roberts was superb in ""Its My Party"" but not even they could do justice to this very bad movie.  Since I can't get my money back, if anyone's looking for a used VHS copy, I seem to have one available!!",990662400,5,845,4.70945945945946
7899502,4,6305979367,This was an intriguing movie. It was sensual without being sexual. I liked the characters. The curiosity among the main character and the adult female artist was fascinating. I didn't figure out the ending. I didn't expect it. Well done,1481328000,,236,4.925

7899506,5,6305979367,"One of my absolute favorites.  My favorite role by Daryl Hannah.  I never tire of it.  I watch it at least once a year.  Beautiful scenery and a great story of a young woman finding herself.  Its the story of a 17 year old named Cally who grew up in a commune in Olema California in the late 60s raised by her father and an assortment of earth mother hippies left behind after alot went down and her mother took off without a trace.  Cally runs into a blonde woman at a Blues Traveler show named Sabine with blonde wavy hair, the one thing she remembers of her mother.  He becomes enamored by her and is determined to form some relationship with her believing her to be her long lost mother.  Shes looking for a connection to herself that she doesn't necessarily see with her father who's a sweet man who doesn't know how to reach out to her.
Wildflowers is not a fast paced movie and if your don't like indie films or need the instant gratification found in polished hollywood big budget films, you probably won't like it.  In one scene you can tell when Sabine and Cally are talking that in some manner split and the shades of blue and shadow changes and for some reason I love that.
The film also has a sad note because Callys friend Graham is played by the late Richard Hillman who died when he was 34.",1458432000,,1306,4.276422764227642

7899510,3,6305979367,A strange but beautiful chic flick that goes back to the turbulence of the 60's and looks as how our actions changed our children...and how they continue to be affected. Callie is immediately fascinated with Sabine when she moves to town to aid a dying friend. She abandons her friends and father to immerse herself in Sabine's life to learn more about the woman she thinks is her mother. It is not great acting and more slowly but the scenes are beautiful and artistic. The film reminds you that your family is where you find them.,1411516800,,532,4.552083333333333
7899511,3,6305979367,"Not sure what to say about this one. I love Clea Duvall, Love Daryl Hannah. This film was whimsical and made me want to live in San Francisco to sleep on the beach everyday and live on a houseboat. It was just too unbelievable, even for 1985. How do people pay bills? No one seemed to have a job more than babysitting and painting. I enjoyed the creativity and breathtaking cinematography with lovely scenes that painted the life of a meandering artist, but the film script could've found it's direction earlier than it did and not drag one through endless scenes that made no sense whatsoever. I felt for Callie, the main character, but it seems she was more mature in the beginning of the film, than at the end where she throws herself into the arms of an older (creepy) man and throws a tantrum in front of the family she babysits for when her father shows up unannounced. Sabine was almost magical, but severely bipolar and unpredictable. She also cried a lot and was so skittish, I hardly believed she wouldn't really just disappear before the end of the film. Somehow, she seemed so unreliable, it became unbelievable.  I really liked the concept and scenery,  but the way it was done  was too choppy and left me feeling empty and somehow felt unfinished.",1385251200,,1261,4.595555555555555
