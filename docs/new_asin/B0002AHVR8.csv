This video would be a lot better if it had more videos of wild animals present in a circus as well as more animal puppet scenes, something most toddlers really enjoy.",1150934400,,281,4.73469387755102
8025179,5,B0002AHVR8,"Once again I am thrilled with the video. So far, all three in the series are on my 2 and a half year olds request list. He loves them and so do I. Its been over a year since we got the first video of the series and I can honestly say, unlike other videos they have yet to start collecting dust! They just don't loss their luster. They are fun, bright, happy, and most importantly educational. All I can say is, please keep them coming! Thank You Baby Road Trip!!",1089590400,,462,4.087912087912088
