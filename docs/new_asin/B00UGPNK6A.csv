7037563,5,B00UGPNK6A,"I have purchased every Adam 12 season available, with season 4 being the latest. I am looking forward to future seasons, and will purchase them when they become available. This is a very good police series with a great cast.",1269043200,,224,4.625
7037564,5,B00UGPNK6A,"This show is a gem.  I've enjoyed every season, including season 1, although the quality before Shout took over production left something to be desired.  The chemistry between the two leads is very believable and while it did come out of Jack Webb's factory (just the facts) you really feel like you know what makes Malloy and Reed tick.  It's like finding a wonderful time capsule that spotlights late '60s/early '70s Los Angeles.  I remember loving this show as a kid so when it came out on DVD I've waited for each release.  If you're a fan of classic TV you will not be disappointed.  There are also quite a few guest appearances by faces you will no doubt recognize.  Keep 'em coming!",1268611200,6,689,4.5528455284552845
7037565,5,B00UGPNK6A,"Shout factory has done a fantastic job in their releases of Seasons 2 and 3 of Adam 12 (Universal did season 1).  The picture quality is crisp, sharp, clear and with excellent color - no fading or worn picture.  The audio is clear.  Packaging consists of a nice outer box with two slim plastic holders containing 2 DVD's each.  The DVD's are one sided.  There have been some nice additional features that Shout has put together for the releases.

This is one of my favorite police dramas of all time.  It gives a nice glimpse into the police work of the very late 60's and the first half of the 70's).  This season marks a newer looking police car for Reed and Maloy (not a big deal - just an observation).  They switch from a 1968/69 Plymouth Belvedere to a 1971 Plymouth Satellite.  The final three seasons (seasons 5-7) saw a third car, an AMC Matador.  As always, expect high moral values and integrity from these police officers (something that marked each of Jack Webb's biggest hits - Dragnet, Adam-12 and Emergency!).

A great show to watch as a family.",1266278400,23,1061,4.526315789473684

7037680,5,B00UGPNK6A,"Adam-12 may be seen as the quintessential cop show of the late 1960's and early 1970's. The series follows the every day interactions  of Offers Pete Maloy (Martin Milner) Jim Reed (Kent McCord) as the patrol the streets on Los Angles.

  Season four is midway through the series run as Adam-12 was in production for seven seasons (from 1968 through 1975). This season is my favorite in that it marks the first and only time in the series that the Plymouth Satellite is used for the main patrol car.",1431129600,,499,4.573033707865169

7037739,5,B00UGPNK6A,"Watching these as an adult is like watching them for the first time.  The subjects are real and the cast is great.  I remember my dad, a former policeman, talked about how this show portrayed the roles accurately.  They didn't sugar coat the issues but they are not the graphic dipictions of the police shows today.  Just a day in the life of a patrolman.  Martin Mulner and Kent McCord were great... great chemistry.  I bought all seasons.  Even thought the last show was almost forty years ago, I still cried at the end.",1389744000,4,522,4.48936170212766
7037740,4,B00UGPNK6A,"Los Angeles, 1972. A simpler time relative to todays high-tech police dramas, but with material just as compelling storywise. The cases are real and the criminals every bit as desperate, slick and ruthless.

Los Angeles police Officer Pete Malloy (Martin Milner) and his hot shot rookie partner, Los Angeles police Officer Jim Reed (Kent McCord) patrol the mean streets of L.A. running into all sorts of crime . . . from anti-Semitic criminals to assassins to hallucinating drunks: they see it all.

ADAM-12 was also a spin-off of the popular police detective drama DRAGNET (both created by the legendary Jack Webb whom is best known as DRAGNET's Sgt. Joe Friday), this police drama ran for 7 years on NBC from 1968 to 1975. Get ready to roll out in the name of protection and service for this 1973-74 Season of the action-packed police drama ADAM-12.

Best-selling author and prolific television producer Stephen J. Cannell (THE A-TEAM, 21 JUMP STREET) joined the series this season as head writer and story editor.

These episodes of ADAM-12 are also complete & uncut & commercial-free without all those deleted scenes you'd get on Cozi-TV, ME-TV, Antenna TV, TV Land, and Nickelodeon.

BTW, Warner Bros. Will be releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1268,4.962264150943396

7037767,4,B00UGPNK6A,"This is among my favorite police drama series.  While other reviewers have mention the clear bright picture as good as when it airs on TV I find it interesting that despite the plain gray dingy walls of the police station how much brighter the halls and work areas Pete Malloy and Jim Reed work in compare to how low light the modern police drama police stations like Law and Order or CSI  give off.

One of the things I like about the series is their is very few night watch episodes and the majority of the ones that exist you can still see the actor well on the screen.  This episode in this season has such police cases that are especially good. Episodes from a sniper attack on Jim,a civilian who likes playing cop a little too much, extortion of all kinds, drag racers and working under cover. It also introduce the start of new police programs and show how police work have changed from years past.

The fact Universal Studios were still going Adam 12 in 1970s its a shame the studio could never of had L.A. famous detective Columbo make a guess appears like how Jim Reed  guest stared on Dragnet or how the cast of Emergency would later guest star in season 5.",1353456000,,1168,4.3842592592592595

7037770,5,B00UGPNK6A,"I watched seasons 4-7 via Netflix and I think S-4 it is my favorite mainly due to the awesome 1971 Plymouth Satellite they drive.
It looks great and sounds even better !
McCord and Milner do another great job as Reed & Malloy and have some fantastic episodes.
I am just waiting on the price to come down to around $20.00 before I purchase it on DVD.
Don't understand how Netflix has seasons 6 and 7 on DVD but we cannot purchase them yet !?",1291161600,,440,4.188235294117647

Reed and Malloy are out on patrol again, encountering all sorts of nefarious evil doers and weirdos.
Creepy Gary Crosby appears in several episodes as the obnoxious Officer Wells.
This set comes in a box with 2 plastic holders containing 2 single-sided DVDs each.
The video and audio quality is excellent.
SHOUT! is doing a great job with its releases of this great cop series.",1276732800,5,440,4.802631578947368
7037785,4,B00UGPNK6A,I found Season 4 to be my least favorite of the 4 available seasons on DVD. At least two of the scenarios would have actually been handled by the detective bureau and not uniform patrol officers. This is still the all time best police fact-based drama to ever be on television. The use of General Motors products as bad guy vehicles 90+ percent of the time is a bit much. Newer style 1971 Chrysler products as patrol vehicles and a new opening scene is refreshing. Malloy has been promoted to Officer 3 starting in scene one. He deserves the new pay grade. All in all it is a must to have in a seven season collection.,1276128000,2,618,4.336206896551724
7037786,5,B00UGPNK6A,"I was hoping to get this one and I was glad to see that I wasn't disappointed. Watching this is actually a trip to the past, to see some of the things as they were at the time. It's amazing to see just how things have changed, but the action though is still good and it still holds interest the way it did when it first came on the scene. I look forward to the next season.",1273708800,,373,3.857142857142857

7037788,5,B00UGPNK6A,"""this is an all-time favorite ""police drama"", especially among fans who(like myself) watched this show as a kid, & we saw the men in blue, as we would like them to be.today's ""cop shows"" are major disapointments; these shows didn't have 12 or 13 sub-plots, just 30 mins. of dramatic entertainment at it's best!""",1271289600,9,311,4.777777777777778

7037790,5,B00UGPNK6A,My daughter and I love Adam-12.  I watched it as a child and now she loves the show.  We have the first four seasons which are all great.  I had purchased a so-called complete series DVD set but that turned out to be a bunch of over the air recordings which had bad sound and some commericials.  This is the real deal.  Original TV quality.  Just wish they'd release the other seasons for us to buy.,1269820800,,399,4.184210526315789
