4594230,5,B005775M40,"I just finished watching Good Neighbors, I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a really good and entertaining suspense drama, that is mostly Character driven.
the story follows three main characters that live in the same apartment complex, each living their own lives, and getting to know each other as friendly neighbors. At the same time, their seems to be a serial killer in the same area, which creates tention among those characters.
Sure the movie has a slow pace to it, but it really keeps your attention and never feels boring, I personally enjoyed it, and thought that the best thing about this movie are the characters, whom each had thier own twisted personalities, own agendas and different lives though living in the same complex.
the film displays and demonstrates humans and their behaviors, how much self centered we can be. all characters were smart, but selfish and had secrets hidden despite acting as good neighbors. brilliant human nature display here.
the director managed to capture and create a dark suspensful atmosphere, relying on the cold snowy and depressing Canadian winter, and at the same time, offered some relief with some funny moments and some what lovable and mysterious characters.
overall, it was a dark suspensful drama, with interesting characters played very well with some talented actors, keeps you guessing and intrigued as events unfold.
I highly recommend this. 4.5 stars.
the ending however, might leave much to be desired.",1320710400,2,1480,5.094650205761317
4594231,5,B005775M40,"I rented this movie over the internet not certain how good it would be. I didn't read any reviews on it, so I went in cold. Wow, was I suprised. Strong characters, tight plot, no funny camera tricks, no red herrings, no gratuitous frights... just a straight up cat and mouse murder mystery that is absorbing, ironic with a few moments of laughter in it. I have to say, there hasn't been one like this in many years.
I believe going in on this one blind made the difference because if I had read anything about it I may have been mislead. If you like murder mysteries this one is for you. I'm not going to give away the plot, that's already been done in other reviews. I will just say this is a fresh look and twist on the cat and mouse murder mystery that is worth seeing. Thoroughly enjoyable! Highly recommended.",1320451200,13,814,4.326797385620915
4594232,4,B005775M40,"GOOD NEIGHBORS is an original noirish-style thriller focusing on a quartet of neighbors in a Montreal apartment complex.  We meet Louise (Emily Hampshire), a waitress in a Chinese restaurant with a strong attachment to her two cats; Spencer (Scott Speedman), a wheelchair-bound cynic who likes tropical fish; Victor (Jay Baruchel), the nerdy newcomer who develops an attachment to Louise; and Valerie, the foul-mouthed lady who hates Louise's cats and complains about everything.
A serial rapist/killer is terrorizing the city and how these characters figure in the mix forms the core of the movie's narrative.  To reveal more would spoil the film's clever plot twists.  The movie has a slow pace but holds your attention as it reaches its unexected climax.  The performances are uniformly very good and there's a sinister eeriness that accentuates the mood of the film.  GOOD NEIGHBORS is a refreshing change of pace in an ofen tired genre.",1320105600,,941,5.2052980132450335
4594233,4,B005775M40,kept me interested through to the end.  Loved how your perspective about each character changes as the movie progressed. The ending was a bit frustrating.,1317859200,3,154,5.16
4594234,4,B005775M40,"A unique bit of suspenseful storytelling with a touch of black cat comedy in which I don't recall having seen this plot before and for that reason and for the realistic portrayals by the actors I give a nearly perfect score. The exception is not because of any horrific scenes, of which they were all implied, but for the lack of an alternate ending amongst which I would have preferred one particular ending.

So, here is my thought on ending the movie. Since semen was on the cat hating (actually hating everything and one) person's body the police should have, but didn't (in their customary dumb ass movie portrayal) collect and compare amongst all the victims. Having done so they would have found two killers and not one. That would have left only the latest killer to pursue her cat loving ways. Thus, one killer down, one innocent (but has a character that is better for it) in jail, and one free to create a sequel.",1317772800,,924,4.566265060240964
4594235,3,B005775M40,"The movie starts out slow. In fact I was ready to turn it off a few times and watch ""Flying Nun"" reruns. But it is just attempting to establish character, at least the character we normally see without secrets. The ""action"" takes place in an apartment building with 3 English speaking people living in French Canada. Louise (Emily Hampshire) lives alone with 2 cats with which she has bonded. The rest of her neighbors loathe her cats. She works at a local Chinese restaurant within walking distance.

Spencer (Scott Speedman) is a large blond confined to a wheel chair. We later find out he was married and his wife died in the same wreak that confined him to said chair. He is considered a hunk by the older women in the building and they suspect that he and Louise would one day get together. He loves fish (live or cooked). He has anger management issues which sometimes slip out. While he is in a wheel chair, his legs are normal as there appears to be no reason for him to be in the wheel chair.

Victor (Jay Baruchel) is the new guy in the building. He is a bit spastic and is irritating with his constant chatter. He develops a love for Emily which is not returned.

There is a serial killer in the city and Louise is obsessed with the thought as her friend at the cafe was a recent victim. The victim had a date that night with a large blond guy named ""Roland."" A large guy named ""Roland"" is also conducting the investigation. The French Canadian woman who lives in the building is shown in a bad light and provides some inner conflict.

As events unfolded and made the characters more interesting and improbable, I found myself still waiting for things to happen. Magnolia generally does the feel good Indie films with a fitting lame acoustical sound track. In this film they were clueless about a decent sound track, something that would have added to the film. I would not call this a ""noir"" film or a ""thriller"" as does the DVD hype. It is an indie with typical quirky characters, a movie heavy on building characters and light on action. Might make for a rental if you really love Indie films and cats.

F-bomb, sex, nudity. The rating claims ""strong violence and graphic nudity"" which are perhaps over statements. There is one violent scene without a close up and one weird nude scene with Emily Hampshire in the dark.",1317513600,3,2333,4.505910165484633

4594237,4,B005775M40,"I hesitated to spend the $3.99 after reading the one and only other review of this movie but am glad I threw caution to the wind and maybe my money. Good Neighbors is a really entertaining movie.  It's a bit off-beat and quirky but great characters, well acted and very interesting. I thought the dialogue was fun and the relationship between the three main characters engrossing. Give this movie a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1317168000,17,433,4.773333333333333
4594238,3,B005775M40,"""A woman your age should always be concerned for her safety, it's a
nasty world."" Victor (Baruchel) has just moved to Montreal in the
middle of a killing spree by a serial killer. He meets his new
neighbors Louise and Spencer (Speedman) and does his best to become
friends with them. Soon secrets are revealed. I will start by saying
that I did enjoy this movie. The big problem with it is that it was
very flat all the way through. Never got bad enough to stop watching
and trying to figure out the killer made you want to keep watching till
the end. The movie never really got to an exciting point where you are
totally engrossed in it. I can't really say anything bad about this
because I did like it, but I can't say anything good about it because
it was slow and drawn out with very little action. Overall, not a bad
movie so worth a watch. Not a good movie so don't rush to watch it
though. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think so.

4594239,1,B005775M40,"Good neighbors is insultingly predictable, with stilted dialogue and bizarre-o bad acting. I watched forty-five minutes, and when what I'd been predicting happened, I went online to read reviews. Another reviewer mentioned that the film becomes sickening to watch. Considering the serial rapist murderer plot, and the exorbitant amount of time spent showing the main character's love of her cats, there were enough ingredients for gruesome visuals, which I am extremely unfond of.  There was no point continuing on with an increasingly klutzy film, with nary a thrill to be found - just the unearned dread of something nasty. The question this movie poses is, ""Who can you trust?"" A thriller could have been made around the query without resorting to the old hat, crime TV stand-by: brutal violence against women. Don't waste your time on this brain numbing mess.",1313539200,4,863,5.164285714285715

4594263,2,B005775M40,"I won't lie; the main reason I watched this is because I'm a little obsessed with Scott Speedman. So I gave it an extra star because he's in it. So we're up to two. This was ok as something to half pay attention to while I worked on an art project, but that's it. My boyfriend was unfortunately roped into watching it with me and his rating would be about 1 star (because he does watch a lot of really bad zombie movies so he's got to give this at least some credit.) The storyline kind of had some potential, I was really hoping it would go somewhere cool but they spent way more time building up the weirdness of the characters and maybe 5 minutes of effort into the point of the plot. I felt like whoever wrote it just threw together an ending after getting overly involved in describing just how odd cat-loving Canadians can be. Then they threw in a suspicious and lonely nerd, a hot dude in a wheelchair (or is he..yeah the previews go ahead and give you that answer) who seems to really like fish, for some reason that's never explained, creates a little love triangle (but let's be serious, clearly this chick is way more into cats romantically than humans) some predictable murders, and calls it a day. However, if you're looking for something to use in an argument over whether or not cat people are genuinely some of the strangest people that exist, this is your movie.

Who doesn't love a good murder mystery, and this one held your interest from beginning to end. Each of the three main characters have their own little quirks and secrets, which are revealed as they are endlessly thrown together. The plot centers around a serial killer still on the loose and how it effects our  little group of players.  I'm proud to say I figured out the killer early in the movie, and you probably will too.

I'd like to say it's because the character has a lot of depth, but I'm pretty sure it's because playing ""guess what strange thing Louise is going to do next"" is the only thing driving the movie.  Seriously: take her away and pretty much all that's left is a couple of fish feeding and cat scenes.  I guess they're supposed to symbolize a sort of cat-catches-fish game.  Anyway, a movie called ""Good Neighbours"" kind of implies that the neighbors will actually be a crucial and interesting part of the plot.  One of the neighbors was a serial killer and they actually managed to make the reveal boring by making it so obvious beforehand.  If I could unwatch it I would: Proceed with caution.",1398643200,5,1078,4.826086956521739
4594308,5,B005775M40,"Louise (Emily Hampshire- COSMOPOLIS) lives in an apartment building in Montreal w/ her two cats. She lives above her disabled neighbor, Spencer. One day, a new tenant named Victor (Jay Baruchel- also COSMOPOLIS) moves in. The three have an awkward relationship, since Spencer seems a bit jealous and very tense. Meanwhile, a vicious serial killer is raping and murdering young women in the neighborhood. This fact is made painfully clear when one of Louise's coworkers becomes a victim. Back at the apartment building, Louise's cats are found dead, Victor falls in love w/ Louise, Louise falls in love w/ Victor's cat, a dark secret is revealed, and a diabolical plot is devised. GOOD NEIGHBORS is a semi-comedic, quirky thriller w/ some very interesting twists, and a few rather gruesome turns.

4594320,5,B005775M40,"I just watched this for the second time, about four months after I saw it originally; my original impressions were confirmed. This is a brilliant little film in my estimation: it manipulates all of our expectations about who these characters are and what ""normal"" is. Indeed, ""normal"" doesn't really fit in anywhere, with a sexual serial killer on the loose, a goofy but well-intentioned new neighbor and a heroine who will shock your socks off.

Spencer is charming, smooth and outrageously handsome, but there is something incredibly menacing in his smile and his playful cruelty from the start. (The scene where he ""romances"" Louise's co-worker from the Chinese restaurant is blood-curdling.) Victor, a nerdy and sweet newcomer to the apartment building, is clumsily gallant and lives in  his delusional desire; Louise is quirky yet deadpan and afectless except when it comes to loving felines, but cold-blooded and willing to go a long, long way to get what she wants. And then there's the awful and hilarious alcoholic neighbor who hates all people and cats and who spouts obscenities non-stop, two cops tracking the serial killer, and two kindly middle-aged women who haven't got a clue about what's going on.

The normal and the abnormal are so seamlessly woven together in this movie that I was somewhat left with my jaw dropping: I really loved the way it creates a hero and a heroine while at the same time it tends to blur the line between what makes a sexually sadistic serial killer different from...everyone else... It's a very funny, chilling, creepy movie; I loved its intelligence.",1382140800,3,1598,5.0

4594322,4,B005775M40,"For people who may be picking up this film because they enjoyed ""The Trotsky"" -- be warned! Although the story also takes place in Montreal, and writer/director Jacob Tierney is working with some of the same actors, this story is much darker and its view of human nature is a lot less upbeat -- Jay Baruchel and Emily Hampshire are playing very different characters this time around. Let's face it ... the resident cats are the nicest creatures you encounter in the main setting, a run-down apartment building in the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grce, or NDG. As in his previous work, Tierney's unapologetic about the Canadian setting, and doesn't try to pass it off as some generic US city. There are numerous references to the English-French cultural conflicts, in the months during and after the Quebec referendum in 1995. The dreary cold winter helps accentuate the isolation that the building's occupants are experiencing. On the surface, the story would appear to be about the friendships that new arrival Victor (Jay Baruchel) makes when he moves in. But the key characters are all flawed in some way -- hostile, delusional, passive-aggressive -- and inevitably the tense situation deteriorates. I don't want to give away too much, but people who are really turned off by onscreen violence, to the point of having nightmares if things get too graphic, may want to skip the last half of the film. Aside from that, it's a fascinating character study about the interactions of a group of troubled people. Some of them seem to be textbook examples of what psychologists like Robert Hare have been trying to warn us about. There is some comedy, but it's appropriately dark and disturbed. There's an extended nude scene, but given what leads up to it, people may find it more ominous than titillating. Really, by the end of the film I was just grateful that I don't live in that building!",1361836800,,1891,4.894080996884735
4594323,1,B005775M40,"On several movie site I visit, there had been a buzz about an independent Canadian murder mystery film, that was supposed to be quite a thriller with big twist at the end. It sounded like the perfect movie for me and I couldn't wait to see it! Good Neighbors is about an apartment building in Canada that is getting a new tenant named Victor (Jay Baruchel). Victor immediately sees that something isn't right about the new place and soon learns that everyone is on edge because of a serial killer on the loose. A serial killer that I was able to identify ten minutes into the movie. How in the world can anyone, much less a movie fan, call this a thriller with a twist in the end? The killer was obvious from the very beginning and I'm willing to bet the average fourth grader would agree. As for the notion that this is a thriller? Come on, a thriller is supposed to have you on the edge of your seat, not falling asleep in it! The story was slow, sloppy, and predictable, but what about the acting. I generally like Jay Baruchel, but he is a mess in this film. Baruchel is way out of his element here and would probably do best sticking to Apatow comedies. The only bright spot in the film is Emily Hampshire, she's been around a while, but has never been in anything big. Hampshire was terrific and is really the only interesting character in this film. Good Neighbors is a huge disappointment and anyone who tells you otherwise can't be as big a movie fan as they proclaim to be. I can deal with slow moving, I can live with some boring parts here and there, but a painfully predictable story with very below average performances is a recipe for disaster.",1361491200,3,1659,4.3896103896103895

Although one of the other ""one star"" reviewers suggested the movie was not clear as to who the serial killer was, I thought is was all too obvious. If you find yourself after 20-30 minutes ""into"" the movie wondering whether you should keep watching, go with your gut & turn ""it"" off.",1356652800,2,525,4.515789473684211

However, if you stick it out, they pull out an impressive twist and the movie actually becomes good.

I have no idea why it's listed in the 'comedy' category.  Drama, thriller...yes and yes.  But there was nothing comedic about it unless you just have a twisted sense of humor and get a kick out of the ending.

Set in Quebec during the holidays, and while a vote is taking place on whether or not they should secede from Canada, a few residents of an apartment building are nervous over the fact a serial killer is on the loose in their neighborhood. Scott Speedman as Spencer is in a wheelchair due to a car accident. Jay Baruchel as Victor, is an elementary school teacher just back from China and new to the building. Emily Hampshire as Loise waits tables at the local Chinese restaurant and owns two way cool cats. Their lives intersect in a quirky way as they grapple with the varying things going on around them.

This is a darkly funny movie. It's laced with good characters. The two cats have an enormous amount of personality and the story turns in some unexpected ways. I was fairly certain on the killer's identity but that turns out not to be as important as the way things play out. You find out who he is pretty early on in the third act so there is nearly another half hour for other things to happen. Speedman is good. He walks a fine line between being glib and being just plain nasty. I liked Emily Hamshire in ""Snow Cake"" and she's equally good here. Her relationship with her cats really adds quirk to the story. Jay Barushel might be playing the schlub card a bit too strongly but he's still good.

All 3 main characters are weird on the surface.  Louise (Hampshire) has an unusual affection for cats.  Very unusual.  Victor is the newest tenant and is one of those guys who just try too hard to be friends.  He also has eyes for Louise.  Spencer (Speedman) is in a wheelchair, but is a bit too friendly to be real.

All are tormented by a nutty (even by their standards) French speaking, cat hating neighbor who's on the verge of a breakdown.
