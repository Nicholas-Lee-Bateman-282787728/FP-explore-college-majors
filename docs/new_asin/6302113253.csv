425435,4,6302113253,"Good , but not the best story by Willie. The product shipped well and quickly. MY  ""Willie"" Favorites are Honeysuckle Rose, and The Red headed Stranger.

425436,1,6302113253,"This is not a western as I thought based on the cover picture, but in the mode of the old McCloud TV drama series, I thought it might have some redeeming value as light entertainment. Sadly mistaken. This is a pitiful and failing attempt to capitalize on the (Chuck Norris) Texas rangers get their man no matter what. Poorly written, acted, directed, and edited. Cliche after cliche in one predictable scene after another. I labored through most of the film with the help of 2X fast forward ability, especially the lurid ""sex scene"" and promptly discarded the entire package into thrash recycling.
Other than the above, I really liked the title.",1262995200,,645,4.81981981981982
425437,4,6302113253,"Just a fun, good time western.  Good action and plenty of plot twists.  It is very much like a episode of Walker, Texas Ranger, but much better acting and action (no martial arts though).  Kris Kristofferson is good in his role and believable as a texas ranger who is investigating a murder in order to clear a friend's name.  Joan Severance is the FBI agent who helps Kris with the case and she does a nice job.  As always she is very easy on the eyes and nice to watch (Kris must have enjoyed  the love making scene with her, who wouldn't).  Willie Nelson's character is what really makes the movie; he is a wisecracking con-man who loves to gamble and enjoys playing jokes on other folks.  This role seems like a natural fit for Willie:  that lovable cowboy outlaw image he cultivated in the 70's and early 80's.  Definitely recommend this movie for a fun evening of tv watching!",1197417600,20,882,4.45625
425438,5,6302113253,"This is one of the best sequels to ever come about. Viewing it together with the first, A Pair of Aces is best...gives you the back ground and story line....full of Willie's wonderful brand of humor and Kris Kristofferson as the Cop who's come to bring in Willie the Gambler....it's just awesome!",1061424000,6,296,4.711538461538462
