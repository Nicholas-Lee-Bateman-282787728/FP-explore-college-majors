7771240,5,B01GWEBFRO,"Well, the one I ended up with was the CANADIAN DVD set, and it DOES have the 4 movies, PLUS the series!  I was very happy to actually end of with a complete collection!  The picture on my set matches the picture on this listing (until it gets changed possibly in the future by Amazon...)

  If you want the FULL set, I suggest you make sure you buy it from one of the sellers in CANADA, to be better able to get the edition you really want.",1393286400,42,440,4.011494252873563
7771241,4,B01GWEBFRO,"I missed this series when it was on TV.
Cyberpunk sci fi has since become popular
so this series almost seems steampunk as
we have mobile telephone addiction in a large US population
at the moment. Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn
making people somewhat crazy about how many connections they have?
What  seems to be happening is the future is catching up with us faster
than sci fi thought it would? Gaming on tablet computers
has taken off in a very interactive way as well?
There are so far no laws against Tek use...
Maybe there should be?",1388707200,,540,4.56701030927835
7771242,4,B01GWEBFRO,"The advancement of civilization, the prevalence of computers in daily life, and the age old corruption in the hearts of men and women is present in this series. Drugs, political corruption, evil, greed, murder, etc, are taken to the next level when rebels, criminals, and society clash. One former cop, Greg Evigan, goes to prison for crossing the line is now is searching for his wife and son who are now involved in hight society. His wife is actually married to a man who helped put him in prison. The stories are written by William Shatner (Star Trek) and prove he's more than just a pretty face and an actor. I can highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys SciFi and futuristic views of civilization both good and bad. I wonder if society is really as stupid as these kinds of stories suggest. We learn nothing from our mistakes, make bigger ones in the future, and seem to be determined to destroy our planet and us with it.",1364860800,23,939,4.562130177514793
7771243,4,B01GWEBFRO,Have wanted this hard to find series for a long time. Nice to finally have it on DVD to add to my collection of other obscure titles like Max Headroom and Painkiller Jane which are also set in the near future.,1363564800,3,209,4.121951219512195

7771274,2,B01GWEBFRO,"I would give the series only 1 star, but I cannot say I hate the series (implied by 1 star); I had some fun moments (very short) with the series for which I would have a hard time to classify it... not SF, not crime, not comedy, not who knows what.
Acting: should be much much better
Story lines: flat
Conversation: dull (predictable)
Characters: not worth mentioning",1448409600,,367,4.492537313432836

7771276,5,B01GWEBFRO,I really liked watching this because it has the first four movies that explain who Jake Cardigan is and why is so against technology of any kind.  I had bought TekWar The Complete First Season but it only has the eighteen episodes not the movies.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction or anything to do with the future.  Also William Shatner stars in this series and he is also the one who wrote the TekWar novels which this is based on.,1445040000,5,459,4.376470588235295

7771278,5,B01GWEBFRO,"I remember watching this when it was first on and thought it was good (ok, maybe a little cheesy).  I still think its good but I really wish there were more episodes and a good conclusion.  In searching Wikipedia, I found that there are 9 tek novels. I havn't read any of them but I think I will try to find them to see how they compare to this show.  The episodes are very well done and for the price its a good value. If your a fan of Shatner or just good sci-fi I would highly recommend this set.",1440892800,3,499,3.97

7771280,4,B01GWEBFRO,"Overlooked but good sci fi.  Greg Evigan is impossible not to like.  Shatners style of writing is sparse and direct.  The TV show is also straightforward.  Its fun.  Just enjoy it and don't try to make too much out of it, although its deeper than it first appears.  You also need to realize how old it is.  It came up with some concepts first.",1438214400,,343,4.265625
7771281,5,B01GWEBFRO,"Great memorable sci-fi show from the 90's by William Shatner. This is my 2nd set which arrived in perfect condition compared to the first set which came with damaged box and cd holders, but was replaced by amazon. Interesting to see familiar actors that were also in Earth: Final Conflict.",1435708800,,289,4.8
7771282,4,B01GWEBFRO,"The series is good Sci-Fi. Good production values and writing, for the most part. My biggest complaint is the absence of closed captioning. For those of us with less than perfect hearing this is a big negative. I have noticed that series produced in Canada or Australia don't seem to have the closed captioning (i.e.. Andromeda, Relic Hunter, TekWar, etc.) more often than those produced in the US. Something to watch out for. 5 stars because I like the series less 1 star because of closed captioning.",1435276800,2,502,4.781609195402299
7771283,4,B01GWEBFRO,I forgot how hokey the CGI in the early 90s was. It does remind me of my youth though.,1433548800,,86,3.5789473684210527

7771286,5,B01GWEBFRO,"Loved this series when it was on TV and holds up well now.  The 4 x 3 format is a little distracting but that's how it was back then.  I've been a big fan of the books and the series, although not as good as the books, was very entertaining.",1429920000,,241,3.8

7771290,3,B01GWEBFRO,"There is a lot to like with the series.  I love the stories and the overall premise of the show.

I hate cheap, slapped-together, dvd productions.  Where's the closed captioning?  Where's the episode guide?

Seriously, is it really too much to ask for companies to produce a quality product rather than just copying a couple of VHS cassettes to DVD and dumping them on the market in hopes of making a quick buck?",1426464000,4,412,4.589041095890411

7771320,4,B01GWEBFRO,"William Shatner really told a future tale with this series. I enjoyed the peak into the future technology and how it would impact human relations. Technology in daily life takes away a lot of the emotional conflicts that humans have today. But it doesn't rid us of the greedy, dictatorial, and just plain evil people.

I think Shatner wanted viewers to do some reflection after each episode, much like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone",1417219200,,429,4.876712328767123

7771333,5,B01GWEBFRO,"I bought the 7 disc box set which contains 22 episodes, the box set is called the ""The Complete Series"" I really enjoyed it, I had never seen these episodes before, William Shatner appears in 4 of the 7 disc's, it shows what the future might be like in 2045, the show has a lot of action and the special effects were not bad considering these shows were made 20 years ago, I highly recommend it for Sci Fi and William Shatner fans, I would like to mention that the rest of the cast were also very good, there was good chemistry between the characters, its a shame that this series only lasted 22 episodes.",1409097600,16,605,4.269565217391304
7771334,5,B01GWEBFRO,Still one of the best series out there. I watched this years ago and envisioned today.,1407974400,,86,4.4375
7771335,3,B01GWEBFRO,"Tekwar was an ""ok"" scifi series from the 1990s. I missed watching it on air due to airtime changes and conflicts.

After watching the complete series recently due to curiosity alone, I can say that nothing much was missed.  It isn't bad - like many other scifi shows from the same time, but it isn't a good as SAAB either.  If you are like me and curiousity mandates you watch this, I understand, however, if you miss it, don't feel bad.",1405123200,,437,4.37037037037037
7771336,3,B01GWEBFRO,"I LOVE cheesy sci fi. However, I have to admit. I'm having trouble getting through the first few episodes. I will persevere in the hopes that the story, acting and special effects get better. However, I'm not optimistic at this time that it will get any better. This is truly painful to watch.",1405036800,,293,4.547169811320755
7771337,4,B01GWEBFRO,"This set includes the 4 tv movies that preceeded the show which did not last long. The show was part of the package called the Action Pack way back during the 90's when syndication would have new shows.
This show is based on a series of books written by William Shatner. It is  surprisingly good entertainment. Greg Evrigan does a credible job as the lead actor. The sets and situations are well done. The price at under $15 is perfect for the fans and newcomers to invest in the show and enjoy the sc fi series.",1404086400,11,512,4.333333333333333
7771338,5,B01GWEBFRO,The first 2 hour special is very good. The other 2 hour specials seem to drag on and on. But the second season shows are 47 minutes long. They are faster paced and hold my attention. If you liked the books or remember seeing the show when it originally aired then purchase the collection. It's a great value.,1401494400,5,308,4.327586206896552

7771342,5,B01GWEBFRO,I love this series and I was grateful to be able to find it and enjoy it after searching a long while for it. I would recommend this series for anyone who is into futuristic shows as there are some great tekkie special affects and good chemistry between the actors/actresses. It is one to keep and re watch whenever you want,1393977600,,324,4.327868852459017
8764140,2,B01GWEBFRO,"This transfer of the series was improperly captured from Betamax tapes, and as a result, suffers from dot crawl and other heinous artifacts. It was also encoded as 100% hard NTSC, which worsened those artifacts; a competent encoder would have used soft telecine wherever possible. A few other shows, like Robocop and the first few seasons of South Park, suffer similar issues.

All four movies were included in the set that I got, but there is apparently a version of this set that doesn't include the movies; be careful which one you buy.  The packaging is decent and none of the discs were defective. The show itself isn't bad. For me, the real highlight is not William Shatner, but Lexa Doig in her first major TV role as ""Cowgirl"". Her scenes often rely on the Hollywood trope of depicting hacking as a video game rather than typing arcane jibberish into a command prompt like ""~$ sudo apt-get update"", and her attempt at a Midwestern drawl is hilariously bad; her acting had definitely improved by the time she starred in Andromeda and Jason X.",1535846400,,1049,4.726775956284153

8764142,1,B01GWEBFRO,"I was very excited to get this collection. Since it is impossible to actually watch, I can only speak to disc quality!

The music score is about 5 times louder than the audio track which makes it impossible to hear dialog. If captioning was included, perhaps I could have muddled through on mute. Without that, even after trying desperately to watch 2 episodes I have no idea what is going on. I tried to turn it way up to hear dialog,  but I only have an angry family and a headache for my trouble.

My copy was a gift and the return/exchange time had passed. I strongly recommend checking the audio track as soon as you receive your copy since apparently some people could actually hear the words. Maybe you will be one if the lucky ones if you do purchase Tekwars.",1524096000,,767,4.387323943661972
