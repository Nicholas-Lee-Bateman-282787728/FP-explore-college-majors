8195730,3,B000QCU9HG,"Although I never received the one I ordered on line, I was promptly reimbursed my money.  I did see this movie on TV back in the summer and it was okay but not anything special as far as the plot.  Best part of the movie was that much of it was filmed in the area I live in and it was fun seeing familiar places in a movie.",1386460800,,323,3.735294117647059
