1409669,5,B000059YRM,"I have seven children -- 11 years old and younger.  I've seen a lot of children's videos (my oldest was very interested in Winnie the Pooh, and we have them all).  Lately, my four-year-old and some of my other children have been watching Digimon, Pokemon, etc..  Somehow we became aware of ""Bob the Builder"" stuff (vidoes, books, etc.).  They have been GREAT!!!  My children, now, watch Bob the Builder videos; they are MUCH BETTER than most of all the other options out there.  They teach a lot of good values and manners, cooperation with others, and helping others.  I heartedly give them Five Stars!",1012867200,3,603,4.740384615384615
1409670,2,B000059YRM,This video highlights fears that my toddler never had before watching it.  I would not buy this video again.  Each machine is afraid of the dark or heights or storms and induces anxiety in small children.,1011139200,2,204,4.638888888888889
1409671,1,B000059YRM,"i was really excited about bob the builder - i think it's a great premise! but when i watched it, i was appalled! bob follows *no* safety procedures whatsoever! this may not be a problem for city parents who want to teach their kids about the construction they see going on around them, but for rural kids, like mine, this is a very dangerous example. if my children ever behaved around our tools, tractors, and farm equipment the way that bob acts around his equipment, they'd lose body parts or risk their lives. i'm so glad i watched this before i allowed my children to see it (or in this case, didn't allow them to see it)!!",1010966400,,629,4.384615384615385
1409672,1,B000059YRM,"My grandson loved, ""Can we fix it"" so I purchased ""To the Rescue"".  Geez, who the heck needs phobic heavy equipment.  The moaning drives me crazy and confuses my 3 year old grandson.  I'm afraid to buy another Bob the builder.",1007424000,2,226,4.463414634146342
1409673,4,B000059YRM,"And my 2 year old son just eats it up, over and over. I don't know where or how he first discovered Bob, but since he did, his life resolves around him and his friends, spud, lofty, scoop, and the rest. The movie has a odd claymation type animation, but seems to work well with the material. The messages are good and honest. I like the fact that fear is shown as something that we all deal with and we each have different fears and strengths.",1002931200,2,443,4.162790697674419
1409674,5,B000059YRM,"Bob the Builder videos are great! I bought these for my 4 year old son, and I am hooked on them too! I can't wait for new ones to come out! I only let my son watch education movies that teach cooperation, manners, etc. I can't stand movies like Rugrats that have rude, obnoxious children that disobey their parents, etc. Bob the Builder is a winner!",998179200,5,349,4.303030303030303
1409675,5,B000059YRM,"I have seen the british version of this (its been out over a year) We have a 2 year old boy who just loves Bob Scoop muck and dissy, glad to see this has finally made it to the US.  For british parents in the US be warned its all been dubbed to american accents so its not the same old Bob we know and love If you have a 2 year old buy it  its the best",986688000,13,352,3.5

7934327,4,B000059YRM,"I and our kids enjoyed ""To The Rescue"".  In our opinion, these earlier Bob the Builder videos were better than some of them that were released not long after when a different person was used to do Bob's voice.  Actually, if memory serves me correctly, I think another character or two had different people doing their voice as well and weren't as good (in our opinion) as the original people.

Bob the Builder never seemed to be as fun or catchy as Barney for those of us that enjoy music and singing, but then again it was a totally different type of show.  Bob the Builder was certainly a clean and cute show teaching important lessons.

As a side note, the VHS case itself was a nice yellow plastic that opened up.  A nice change from the standard cardboard.",1464307200,,761,4.438848920863309

7934329,2,B000059YRM,"The price of this DVD was definitely not the issue, but the description was. It was described as ""in great condition"", and it should have been ""good"" at the very best. The DVD did work, but it was very, very scratched.",1313625600,,218,4.341463414634147
7934330,3,B000059YRM,"Like all the other Bob the Builder videos ""it's ok"" is about as nice a thing you can say.  There's nothing much memorable about any of the stories.  And the characters can get grating after a while.  If I was forced to find one good thing about it I'd have to say that the clay-mation is good.  That's about all.",1112054400,,312,4.15
7934331,4,B000059YRM,"This is my two year olds first Bob the Builder.  He has generally only wanted to watch a Baby Mozart and nothing else, but the first time he watched it, he was hooked.  He would sit there and nothing could distract him.

He really enjoys the opening song of Bob the Builder, but he does get a little bored toward the end of the show.  With that said, the first 20 minutes are gold for him as he really enjoys it.

This is not too bad for us adults either except for Lofty who is always whiny and tough to listen to, but it is a nice little show.  He would give the show 2 thumbs up!  We will be trying some additional Bob the Builder dvds.",1100476800,,639,3.984251968503937
7934332,3,B000059YRM,"I bought this set for my 1 yr old. He loves the Celebrate With Bob dvd. But I have had to put away the Rescue dvd. It is about Muck being scared of the dark. Believe it my son is scared of this and is now scared of the dark. I hope when he is older and understands more I will be able to play this again and he will not be scared.
Be careful and observe your child, if they get scared take it away the first time they watch it. So that they do get scared of the dark.",1087948800,,467,3.633663366336634
7934333,1,B000059YRM,"My 2-year-old loves Bob the Builder, and I would recommend other B-t-B shows, but NOT THIS ONE!  It deals with the fears that the various machines have in a very negative way.  Instead of overcoming and triumphing over their fears, they wallow in them and are consumed by them.  Lofty, for example is afraid of heights.  When Bob gets stuck on a tall scaffolding, Lofty is too afraid to lift the ladder to him, and leaves his friend stranded for several hours.  Although Wendy does eventually manage to talk him through the process of lifting the ladder, Lofty does not learn to be any braver in the process.  A similar situation happens when Muck is working in a tunnel when most of the lights go out--she is terrified of the dark, and is too afraid to move or come out of the tunnel even with help.  Again, she eventually manages to come out of the tunnel, but has no growth or triumph from the experience.  I let my son watch this DVD twice, after which he ran into a dark hallway, shut the door, and started saying, ""it's not that dark!  It's not that dark!""  He has never been afraid of the dark, and I don't want him to learn to be from this DVD.  We won't be watching this particular video again.",1082419200,6,1203,4.349775784753363
7934334,2,B000059YRM,"This particular video features Lofty and Muck more than any other characters from the show. Nearly all of the episodes deal with one or another phobia (Lofty's fear of heights and general tentativeness, Muck's fear of the dark...and mice...and sounds at night). Both characters are shown whining on and on and on about their fears. It's truly annoying. Shows that deal with phobias can potentially help a toddler get over those fears, but this video simply reinforces them without showing characters that have overcome their fears. Each new episode starts with the same rediculous amount of fear and trepidation. Can we fix it? ""Uh, I think so....""
Other features I dislike are scenes of Spud the scarecrow taunting Lofty about his fears, and Bob exhibiting poor judgement about safety.
My husband and I think Lofty should be fired. Please rent this before buying. Let's not encourage them to make any more copies of it.",1059436800,3,920,4.98051948051948
7934335,3,B000059YRM,"I'm a big Bob the Builder fan, looking forward to new episodes almost as much as my two-year-old. (I should probably be embarrassed to admit this!) But this video is not one of my favorites. The stories seem to focus almost exclusively on the various fears of Lofty and Muck, and consequently there's more than the usual amount of whining and crises of confidence. Several of the characters are seen telling ""white lies"" which they are never called to rectify. Also, there's very little of Travis (my son's favorite) and Farmer Pickles, and in Spud's one appearance he transcends mischievous to become downright mean.
It's still good. The usual Bob attention to quality is intact, and there are good messages to be gleaned. But on the whole it's a somewhat negative experience for children. You'd do much better with ""Pets in a Pickle"" or ""Can We Fix It?""",1048723200,3,855,4.783783783783784
