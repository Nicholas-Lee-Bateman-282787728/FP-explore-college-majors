He might have recorded better sessions in years past, but this one and the additional ""Basic theory DVD by Happy Traum are not worth the money the spent to record it.",1386979200,,271,4.787234042553192

8376203,5,B002ON115Y,"Here is a DVD set that I have been waiting for:  Music Theory for the guitarist!

It is presented by an experienced professional teacher, Happy Traum.  Please see my other reviews of Homespun and Happy Traum's teaching.

This is another in a long series of guitar instruction via DVD.  Like the others, it does not disappoint.

The material is Music Theory, and Traum makes no miscalculation of his audience.  His teaching is clear, concise, segment by segment, and is for the beginner, as well as the intermediate.  The material is presented in a very structured manner, as he builds his foundation slowly.

The teaching is second to none.

As an intermediate guitarist, I was approached by someone who suggested a course on Music Theory to help expand my understanding of the fretboard; and music in general.  This is my answer.

A 2 DVD set, each approximately 80 minutes, broken into segments, will provide months of ""private lessons"".  The instructor moves slowly and methodically, yet his enthusiasm and crisp mind lay challenges for the student as the teaching progresses.

In terms of video production, it is excellent.  Specifically, there are certain things that make the teaching rewarding:

1.  Background.  With the presentation, the instructor is light hearted yet serious, the background color is black; no distractions.  This is useful especially when much time will be spent learning the material.  His voice is melodic and his demeanor like a wise professor.  No silly costumes, or 'rock star' silly hats, which only draw attention away from the material presented.

2.  Close ups.  Homespun has perfected its camera work.  Not only are there the expected close ups, but the camera moves even without close ups.  This is a high quality production that keeps the eye moving.  Why is this important?  Ever watch a video clip with one camera?  It is unnatural and tedious on the eye. This production uses several cameras and it allows for the eye's concentration to ""break"" at appropriate moments.  It is a subtle thing, but quite noticable when absent.

As to the material itself, I believe that beginning guitarists would do well to digest the material early on, and will find that the foundation set will yield fruit later.  I do think, however, that Advanced players cannot help but benefit from not simply reviewing the material, but making sound their own foundations in music understanding.
From chord framing to scales to many tips on practice and improving, this series is something that no guitarist should be without.  Taking the mystery out of the fretboard, it is a solid foundational teaching.

I do wish chapter headlines had breaks in the DVD, but that is incidental.

I recommend using taking each section, one at a time, and taking notes, as well as practicing with a guitar in hand.

Both DVDs taken together represent an entire course in Introduction to Music Theory.  The instructor's sheer love of guitar radiates, and his gifted style of teaching means much benefit to the student.

I cannot recommend this set more highly.  ***** Star Teaching. See EZ Fingerpicking, Blues, Brownie McGhee, and Traum's excellent Christmas DVD.",1253491200,8,3165,5.02504816955684
