1000609,1,6305262268,"I lived in New Orleans for four years, was very active in the local music scene, and even got married there before moving to NYC.  This movie is awful.  I spent the first hour laughing at the movies characitures, stereotypes, and falsehoods - then fast forwarding through the second half (which drags due to a really bad script).  Anyone who thinks that this film is at all representative of New Orleans culture has notlived in New Orleans.  This film doesn't even work as camp.  A decent film about New Orleans has yet to be made in my opinion, although I understand that Louis Malle's Pretty Baby is quite good.
The film is really sexist too - I can think of a dozen films much sexier than The Big Easy...",997833600,2,707,4.449612403100775
1000610,4,6305262268,"A good cop, who has allowed his principles to be compromised once too often, has it catch up with him amid allegations of internal corruption and what appears to be an impending war between the criminal elements of New Orleans, in ""The Big Easy,"" directed by Jim McBride.  Dennis Quaid stars as Remy McSwain, an eleven year veteran of the New Orleans Police Department, who from the day he joined the force learned that the ""perks"" that went along with the job were all just a natural, acceptable part of the way things are done in the city they call The Big Easy.  It's just the way it is; and all is well until Assistant District Attorney, Anne Osborne (Ellen Barkin), shows up one day, and becomes inordinately concerned with a recent ""wise guy"" murder Remy is investigating.  And it isn't long before things start to get a bit sticky for Remy and a few others who suddenly find themselves caught with their fingers in the cookie jar.  But there are indications that something is going down at the precinct that is somewhat more serious than the penny-ante graft apparently being enjoyed by a number of New Orleans' finest, and Osborne's job is to get to the bottom of it.  Remy, however, doesn't buy the idea that there are ""dirty"" cops amongst his own, and quickly puts some moves on Anne to find out what she thinks she knows.  And it starts him off along a path which, before it's over, he may wish he hadn't opted to tread.

 From the opening credits, as McBride takes you aloft and opens up his camera for a thrilling shot of the bayous and countryside rushing by below (backed by the blood stirring zydeco music that drives the entire film), he saturates the story with an atmosphere that brings New Orleans to life.  And the vibrant sights and sounds of the city (including the engaging Creole dialects), are so richly textured that the city itself becomes as much an integral part of the story as many of the characters.  As Remy would say in greeting, with his best prepossessing grin in place, ""Where you at, chere?""

 And though the story itself is nothing especially original, the lively presentation and the mood McBride sets, as well as some unique characterizations and that special sense of time and place he captures, make it all seem fresh and new.  The zydeco music, alone, is a treat and-- like the city-- is something of a character in itself.

 Quaid fairly oozes Southern charm as the irrepressible Remy, a guy secure with his world and sure of his place in it.  He's obstinate and self-assured, but without being pretentious, which makes it easy to like him.  The natural fluidity of his distinct mannerisms and speech give his performance a ring of authenticity that makes Remy very real and entirely believable-- which, of course, adds credibility to the story.  The character is a good fit for Quaid, and he definitely makes the most of it.

 Barkin does a good job, as well, as Anne, employing her trademark crooked smile to great effect, and she has a genuine chemistry with Quaid that works well for the story.  She brings a decided definition to her character, making Anne a woman who is strong without being overconfident, and not immune to vulnerability; it's her very humanness, in fact, that make her so accessible.  It's a well rounded performance that allows you to see beneath the facade of the professional cop doing her job, to the very real person within.  Barkin plays it all very well, and lets you know that there's more to Anne than meets the eye.

 Notable in supporting roles are Grace Zabriskie, as Remy's mother, and Charles Ludlam as Lamar Parmentel.  Their performances are great examples of the value of a good character actor, and the significant impact they can have on a film.  Far too often they go unnoticed and unappreciated.

 The supporting cast includes Ned Beatty (Jack), John Goodman (Andre), Lisa Jane Persky (McCabe), Ebbe Roe Smith (Ed), Tom O'Brien (Bobby), Marc Lawrence (Vinnie the Cannon) and Solomon Burke (Daddy Mention).  Like a good bowl of spicy gumbo, ""The Big Easy"" packs a wallop and will give you a good helping of satisfying entertainment, well worth the two bucks or so you plunk down for it.  And by the time it's over, you'll be calling people ""chere"" and fighting the urge to strap a washboard to your chest.  So, hey-- where you at?  It's the magic of the movies, chere.",989712000,40,4359,4.671035386631717
1000611,4,6305262268,"Don't get me wrong.  I really love this movie and I watch it over and over.  But that doesn't change the fact that it's silly and unlikely.
The accents are silly, the locations are gratuitous.  To believe any part of  ""The Big Easy"" is to believe that everyone in New Orleans is  Cajun, there's always a parade going on somewhere and someone could  actually jog in midsummer without dying of heat and humidity.
 Once past  that, however, the leads are charming, the writing is snappy and the  scenery is...well, New Orleans.  What more do you need?",958262400,,548,4.614583333333333
1000612,5,6305262268,"Have I already told you that Ellen Barkin is my all-time favorite actress ? No ? O.K. It's done now. One of her most brilliant role was her part in THE BIG EASY directed by Jim McBride. She plays a New Orleans district  attorney investigating corruption among city cops.
How will she be able  to persuade those cops that accepting 50 $ from a bar tender is as illegal  than dealing drugs. Specially when these cops do a pretty good job by  keeping the city clean. It's merely an affair of morale. The problem is  that these cops consider their little paychecks as perfectly normal. And  they don't feel guilty at all. Hard job for Ellen.
The cajun atmosphere  is perfectly described by Jim McBride who is a master, since BREATHLESS, in  the treatment of the colours. The ending of the movie is a masterpiece,  McBride transforming an orange and yellow explosion in a sumptuous black  and white image as pure as the justice and the morale.
THE BIG EASY is  one of the best films noir of the eighties and his arrival on DVD was the  most agreeable surprise of the beginning of 1999.
A DVD for El.. Nope !  for me.",956793600,,1111,4.413793103448276
1000613,4,6305262268,"This is a terrifically original crime caper. Dennis Quaid gives his best performance as a corrupt but well-meaning cop. The underrated and extremely talented Ellen Barkin is also dynamite as the uptight DA assistant. The  chemistry by Quaid and Barkin can light the screen on fire and they create  on of the most attractive couples in movies. The plot is good, but it is  the romance and comedy that leave the impact. Hilarious at times, great  Cajun soundtrack. Good supporting cast with Ned Beatty and John Goodman as  stand-outs. A Very good time. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",956448000,2,594,4.673076923076923
1000614,5,6305262268,"The Big Easy is one of my favorite movies. It has a rich mix of savvy, original characters, including New Orleans itself.  This is Ellen Barkin's best performance as the inhibited DA Anne Osborn being drawn out by the  mildly corrupt detective played by Dennis Quaid. Chemistry, snappy dialog,  good tunes, whimsical romancing: who could ask for more?
The DVD is not  technically exceptional or even particularly good, which is a shame but not  crippling in a character driven story.",927417600,7,483,4.9875
1000615,3,6305262268,Liked the story and the acting was good. Video quality was of couse perfect with DVD but the normally expected surround sound effects and stereo just didn't hold up.

1000805,5,6305262268,Anne Osborn never stood a chance against detective Remy McSwain...way too Cajun/charming & sexy...that's what makes it such fun.  While there's a defiant ol' boys police/actual deadly drama going on...a carnal love story takes prescience.  Inhale the Cajun food & music...I was quite taken maybe 'cause my granddaddy was Cajun.

1000963,3,6305262268,Enjoyed watching Dennis Quaid and him being a detective.  Ellen Bark?? is good in this movie and not quite as seductive as in one she played w/Al Pacino as a sexy woman he gets involved with.  John Goodman has a short part in this.  Filmed in New Orleans and enjoyed the parts of the city.  Depicts how the high office people in WA are deceitful and not to be trusted.,1472947200,,368,4.214285714285714

1000965,3,6305262268,"3 1/2 stars -- I saw this about 25 years ago and enjoyed it.  Seeing it again, I still enjoyed it, but it seemed a bit broader, a bit more stereotyped or tending to cartoonish than I remembered, but still fun.  Dennis Quaid is better than Tom Cruise in what I think of as a quintessential early Cruise role -- cocky young man, who thinks he's God's gift to women, is willing to cut corners in his job, and yet still think that he's ""one of the good guys.""  Well, when the job is as a policemen or detective, those little corners can find you compromised when you least need to be, and that's what Remy McSwain (Quaid) has to learn the hard way.  It IS the Big Easy -- New Orleans -- but if the NOPD is corrupt, as DA Anne Osborne (Ellen Barkin) has reason to think it is, then relaxin' and cutting a few corners can quickly become a serious matter.  Remy puts the moves on Anne, partly to plume up his ego and perhaps too to lower her investigative defenses, and there are a couple of scenes that will steam up your bifocals, but she sticks to her guns, and in pretty short order, Remy finds himself in court.  In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I won't reveal how he gets out of several bad situations and figures out, with Anne, that what seems to be murderous drug war -- for corpses are showing up all over the place -- isn't all that it seems to be.  One could argue, I think, that the procedural matters are handled a bit perfunctorily, by the director, and a good deal of weight is given to music-saturated Cajun atmosphere -- but I like that just fine.  Quaid and Barkin are appealing, Ned Beatty and a younger John Goodman figure in the mix.  Real-life DA Jim Garrison cameos as a judge, and the credits roll at the end to ""Jolie Blon.""  Nice stuff, but not stellar.",1471737600,,1778,4.2648809523809526

1001466,1,6305262268,"The 80s were pretty much known for handing us a slew of steamy cop movies.  It was a decade that was heavy handed with heavy breathing and tried to find a way to utilize sweat to its advantage.  The soap operatic overtones in so many of the more memorable 80s films is hard to ignore or escape, and in some respects it made those aspects work.

But not every respect.

Not this respect.

I kind of love that everyone else seems to love this movie.  Im dumbfounded as to why, but maybe my irritation over it truly does stem from the fact that I cant for a single moment buy that horrid accent Dennis Quaid dons here.  I mean, I wanted to.  I wanted to love this, as Ive always been a fan of Quaid in general, but this was just a bore to watch.  The screenplay is decent at best, with the climax being a rather preposterous but such is the way with many of these types of films.  I just expected to be entranced by the trashy nature of this beast, and it wasn't there for me.  It was less steamy and more sleepy, and thats a problem.

And Quaids accent is atrocious, comical and a disgrace.",1405382400,,1088,4.15311004784689

The story moves forward at a steady pace, the first viewing, presents plot twists that are not telegraphed, a nice change from the spoon fed stories, so common where writers seem to think viewers aren't capable of following plots without obviousness. Ned Beatty, another actor I admire, also stars in this movie. The ambience is light-hearted despite the intensity of passion, and murder, the story is comprised of. The flavor of Cajun influence and the musical atmosphere of New Orleans, leaves you wanting more, but compliments the movie perfectly. I enjoy watching this movie over and over. Amazon delivered this movie with their consistent level of exceptional quality & service. If you enjoy this movie I recommend ""Undercover Blues"" with Dennis Quaid & Kathleen Turner.

1001805,3,6305262268,"I love this film!  I loved it when I first saw it years ago and used to have it on video, until video players disappeared.  Since then, I've been trying to find a DVD that has the proper, full version of the film.

The full version includes a two-minute scene at the end of the film, one that nicely finishes off the story.  It isn't exactly a spoiler to say it is the scene in the hospital after the explosion where Remy proposes (sort of!) to Anne.  It make sense and has a much better flow than the current abrupt version of explosion-straight-to-credits.

I've no idea why this scene has been cut and am baffled by all attempts to censor Dennis Quaid's butt in a hospital gown.  I really want those two minutes back!

Most DVDs on sale now are 100 minutes long and are the cut version.  This retailer listed the DVD at 102 minutes run time, which got me excited; those extra two minutes suggested the film was the complete version.  I was so disappointed when the DVD arrived, marked clearly on the cover as 100 minutes run time.  Yep, the scene was missing.  Given that so many people are flagging the missing scene and keen to find DVDs that include it, it seems somewhat disingenuous to make such a 'mistake'.

If it wasn't for that bit of misinformation, I would not have bothered with buying a DVD from the US, with all the Region 1/Region 2 hassle it involves (I'm in the UK).  Now I am stuck with a mis-sold product that isn't worth the palaver of mailing back to the US.  Not a happy bunny (ggrrr!)",1369526400,7,1510,4.3428571428571425

1001807,3,6305262268,"I was extremely disappointed to see that once again this was not the full movie version of The Big Easy! I know the hospital scene at the end is a bit risque but it ends the movie beautifully and leads into the whole wedding dance.

For those of you who have never seen that scene here's a quick overview: Dennis Quaid is in a hospital bed having had a large splinter removed from his bottom and is typing his resignation. Ellen Barkin walks in greeted by an open hospital gown (you can imagine the glee on her face) and leans over him to see what he is doing. She grabs the resignation and convinces him that he's one of the good guys.

While there's a bit of role reversal (payback) in the bottom caressing ""Don't do that"", ""What, this...or this..."" - the scene is really worth having in the movie.

There is no reason for a movie to be cut like this...on a DVD we expect to see the FULL movie version, or at least the deleted scenes.

Quaid's wild, bad-boy cop role clashes with Barkin's straight arrow by-the-book district attorney although they do manage a few steamy bedroom scenes that certainly look real enough. A local drug war drawn along racial lines is another angle in the film which eventually puts Quaid and Barkin on the same team and from there the movie pretty much evolves into a buddy-cop type urban vehicle. The leads play off each other very well and Barkin's trademark crooked smile is nice to see even if the plot is a bit trite.",1288483200,,732,5.0578512396694215

1001989,4,6305262268,"Both Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin were considered one film away from major stardom when THE BIG EASY opened in 1987.  Although it received reasonably good reviews and was a popular ticket at the box office, it wasn't enough, and to this day both Quaid and Barkin remain ""working actors"" rather than ""stars.""  Although they might disagree, this may actually be a good thing: the result has been a series of interesting roles in interesting films as opposed to more formula work.

Not to say that THE BIG EASY isn't formula: a plot about police corruption; an exotic background re New Orleans; and, of course, the combination of Quaid and Barkin, both of whom were considered sexually hot stuff in the late 1980s and who do indeed live up to the billing in at least one scorching scene and who smoulder nicely in every other.  But in truth, THE BIG EASY is too formula for its own good.  Although the plot is convoluted, it is also predictable and entirely implausible, most particular where the relationship between Quaid and Barkin are concerned--and New Orleans has never been successfully captured by the movies and THE BIG EASY is no exception.  You get a glimpse of what the city is like, or rather was like in pre-Katrina days, but only a glimpse, nothing more.

There are also two major problems with the film.  Perhaps the most distracting is Dennis Quaid's Cajun accent.  Part of the problem is in the script: even true Cajuns don't run around saying ""chere"" with every other breath, much less ""where you at"" every five seconds.  The phrase ""The Big Easy"" is also over-used in the script--and is a tourist term.  Locals are more likely to refer to New Orleans as ""The Cresent City.""  Whatever the case, Quaid's Cajun accent is not so much an approximation as it is an approximation of an approximation.  He does nail it toward the end of the film, but by that time we're pretty much over it.  The other big problem is the plot, which runs in fits and starts, back tracks, and pauses to have Barkin prosecute lover Quaid for corruption in the middle of it all.

All of this said, THE BIG EASY is an entertaining film.  Quaid's accent aside, he delievers a fine performance; so too does Barkin, and the supporting cast is very strong.  The direction is competent and the production values are solid.  As long as you don't expect too much from it, and recognize it as pure popcorn, it you'll enjoy it.  Recommended.

GFT, Amazon Reviewer",1277078400,,2443,4.65034965034965
1001990,4,6305262268,"Sometimes a movie is a little too close to the truth, although it is not recognized as such until later. That is the case with the plot of ""The Big Easy"" a story line that deals with `isolated' police corruption in the Big Easy, New Orleans. Thus, there is plenty of murder, mayhem, and the rest as a big time drug deal by rogue cops gets busted up by the good cops. Not, howe,ver without some anguish and moral qualms along the way. Well, I told you that it was a fairy tale, didn't I? Today's charges of police corruption in the headlines, on any given day, from out of New Orleans since well before Hurricane Katrina puts this story line in the shade. Well in the shade.

Okay, that is on the political level. Now to the real action. The love interest that drives the film, of course. You know the boy meets girl thing. Here ""go along to get along' New Orleans cop, Dennis Quaid (Remy), meets avenging ""angel"" prosecuting attorney, Ellen Barkin (Anne), and after a few, actually very few, preliminaries, they are an item. Oh, did I tell you that Quaid is a good old boy Cajun (or part Cajun, anyway) to add color to this thing. And to take advantage of the New Orleans motif, natch. You are watching this one for the chemistry between Quaid and Barkin, mainly. And, maybe, the sound track that includes some material by various Neville Brothers combinations.

When it comes to murder he's definitely on the right side and is irritated to find his latest investigation being followed by Anne Osborne from the D.A.'s office. Out of work they hit it off pretty quickly, making it difficult for Anne to handle when his more questionable activities come to light and she has to prosecute him. In turn McSwain starts to suspect that he's investigating something more than mob slayings. Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin have phenomenal chemistry in this movie as Remy McSwain and Anne Osborne.

The two stars are fantastic:  Dennis Quaid, is perfect as New Orleans police Lieutenant Remy McSwain, and Ellen Barkin is Anne Osborn, a beautiful but somewhat clumsy Louisiana District Attorney sent to investigate police corruption.

In the opening scenes, a hood's murder starts a gangland drug war.  Smart and sexy Detective Remy McSwain is out to find who is behind it.  Ann Osborn, a district attorney from northern Louisiana shows up in his office the next day. She has been sent to investigate New Orleans Police Corruption.  Remy wants to do his job the usual way, sort of off-beat and over the line.  Anne is there to be a stickler on ethics.  They are opposites in personality yet the chemistry between them is there.

As they work together through a mass of inter-twisted threads of evidence, family secrets and white lies they realize that higher ups in the Police Department are part of the crime.  Together they solve the crime and discover the dark secret of what is going on.

1002076,5,6305262268,"A mystery set in New Orleans -- with Cajun music, sexy love scenes, and a great cast. This movie manages to be fun and suspenseful at the same time.

Remy McSwain is a New Orleans police lieutenant (played with a grin by Dennis Quaid), and Ann Osbourne is a district attorney. She's come to New Orleans to investigate police corruption. He takes her out on the town, and when he scores a free meal at a restaurant, she berates him for taking advantage of police ""perks"". McSwain says perks are part of the job, and he refuses to believe the police are corrupt. ""You investigate cops for a living? We're the good guys, Ann!"" Despite their differences, he flirts outrageously with her, and soon they're romantically involved.

In the meantime, a gruesome series of murders are piling up in New Orleans. Two witnesses claim to have seen an unmarked police car leaving the scene of a homicide. At first McSwain doesn't believe the police could be suspects, no matter what Ann says. He thinks the murders are part of a gang war. Yet as the violence escalates, he realizes there might be killers in his squad.

Dennis Quaid has terrific chemistry with Ellen Barkin (who plays the district attorney). The movie evokes New Orleans, it works as a romance, and it works as a thriller, too.",1251849600,,1279,4.650442477876106

1002145,2,6305262268,"Four years ago, I acquired THREE separate DVDs of this movie as birthday presents.  The respective givers 1.) realized that my birthday was coming up 2.) realized I was about to move to New Orleans and 3.) were at the $6 bin outside the electronics section of Wal-Mart while making realizations #1 and #2.  Despite the multiple copies, I have only been able to watch this movie twice.  The first time, my mother felt necessary to point out during the sex scene that ""you know, honey, in real life, they're exactly your father and I's age.""  The resultant mental scarring from that kept me from re-watching this until yesterday.

I'm one of what Hitchcock disparagingly called the ""plausibles,"" the movie-watchers who can't get caught up in the action and emotion of the story when there are holes in the plot.  (To which I'd reply, fix the damn plot holes, Alfred.) But, I'll start off with what's going right in this movie.

1.  The casting is pitch-perfect.

2.  The general premise is pretty good.

3.  The soundtrack (with the exception of a song Dennis Quaid wrote for it, the type of power-ballad which would be of great aid to bulimics) is fantastic.

4.  It makes good use of the on-location filming in New Orleans.

Now, for what isn't going so good.

1.  Someone should have told Dennis Quaid just to talk like Dennis Quaid.  The Yat accent is a combination of Southern, French, and Brooklyn, and if you can't nail it, don't attempt it.  You'll sound retarded.

2.  The movie assumes that the New Orleans District Attorney's office is less incompetent and corrupt than the NOPD.  This is not true.  Pretty much anyone who gets elected here gets indicted sooner or later.

3.  When you have the ""comic relief"" cops impound a boat for no reason in the first scene, it ain't much of a surprise when it's later revealed that said boat is full of cocaine and the cops are on the take.

4.  You never see Ellen Barkin drive a car in this movie, yet she can show up anywhere in the city (including the other side of the Mississippi River) at any time of the day or night at a moment's notice.  Then, she always either gets a taxi or gets a ride back home with Dennis Quaid.  This is only possible if she a.) leaves her car behind for no good reason or b.) teleports.  There isn't fast or reliable public transit in NOLA.  Also, taxis don't just show up when you call them.  Trust me.  I know.

5.  Dennis Quaid gets called out of a hot date to investigate ""a triple murder in Storyville.""  This movie was made in 1987.  Storyville was torn down to make way for the Iberville Housing Projects in 1937.

6.  Inconsistency and/or inappropriateness in underwear.  This is one of my pet peeves in movie sex scenes.  Most American women wear bras under their shirts as a matter of course whether or not they have anything to put in said bras.  They certainly wear them under white shirts.  They certainly wear them when it is raining.  Ellen Barkin can fill out a bra, her character in this movie is certainly not the type to go to work braless, she is wearing a white shirt, it is raining outside...and in the sex scene she is still wearing the shirt, but no bra.  It is not feasible to remove a bra while keeping a long-sleeve, button-down shirt on.  Again, trust me.  I know.

Also, she gets driven home by Dennis Quaid at one point because she's ill after viewing a bloody crime scene.  She's fully dressed and trying not to puke out the window of his car.  Then, the movie cuts to her vomiting into his toilet wearing nothing but her bra, underwear, and unbuttoned shirt.  So...she's about to hurl, but takes off half her clothes first?  That just doesn't happen in the real world.

7.  Come on.  Everybody with half a brain knows Ned Beatty's character's not what he seems.  Otherwise, plotwise, he's a completely superfluous character and it doesn't matter that he's about to marry Dennis Quaid's mother.

But, all in all, it's a charming and mildly entertaining movie.",1189814400,5,3973,4.5403111739745405

1002243,5,6305262268,"This colorful and fast moving film from director Jim McBride about an only slightly corrupt cop in the ""Big Easy"" and the pretty Assistant District Attorney sent to investigate the department is filled with cajun spice and atmosphere. The lines between right and wrong are blurred like a rainy windshield in this lightning paced and very sexy cop film.

Dennis Quaid gives a terrific performance as Remy McSwain, a second generation cop who sold out early on in his career, accepting it as the norm but not letting it hinder him from doing his job. When the prim but sexy Ellen Barkin arrives on the scene in the form of D.A. Anne Osborne, he attempts to wine and dine his way out of trouble as the bodies start piling up in an apparent drug war.

The charged encounters between Remy and the shy Anne blend seamlessly with some very brutal crime scenes and a lot of New Orleans' music to propel this film at a breezy and very enjoyable pace. When Remy's own corruption is exposed, their relationship becomes more complicated when he tampers with evidence and gets off. But her comment to him that he is no longer one of the 'good guys' causes him to take a serious look at himself. When cops are discovered to be behind all the recent drug trouble, the answers will hit far too close to home.

A very unique cop thriller that manages to maintain a light and breezy ambiance throughout, this is one of the most memorable films of its kind. Its spicy flavor goes down easy and makes you crave more.

Dennis Quaid is a good cop walking the fine line between integrity and corruption - playing at the edges. Too cute by half. His winning, seductive, boyish smile and easy charm make him a perfect foil for the career minded, straight-laced Assistant District Attorney (Ellen Barkin).

But the truth is elusive in New orleans. Things aren't always what they seem and somewhere along the line, choices will be made. Big choices. In the Big Easy. Someone's likely to pay the price. A Big Price.

The film starts out light and breezy but quickly turns dark and sinister when the plot thickens and danger strikes too close to home.

The leads are engaging and winning. The plot is predictable but engaging. And the mood is dark, like New Orleans herself, at night, in the rain, spattering on the greasy sidewalk...",1116892800,,1045,4.693989071038251
1002246,5,6305262268,"A true classic and a definite original for its time. Starring such movie icons as Dennis Quaid, Ellen Barkin, and Ned Beaty, this is the type of movie anyone could enjoy.

The Big Easy follows the life of easy-going Lieutenant Remy McSwaine (Quaid) of the New Orleans police department homicide division as he investigates what appears to be an impending gang war starting with a series of murders on some of the most ruthless gangsters in New Orleans. However, straight-laced Assistant District Attorney Ann Osborn (Barkin) sees things differently as she inserts herself into the investigation, looking at police corruption being the cause. But when they put aside their differences they feel a growing attraction to one another, one that allows them to put aside their differences a few times.

Despite their growing relationship, Ann doesn't ease up on trying to uncover the truth about the murders. Remy feels the same way, but he can't see why a cop would do all this. However, his idea of police corruption is different from how the District Attorney and Internal Affairs see it as they catch him accepting a bribe. What makes it harder for Remy is that he knows it's illegal, but he and many others on such a take consider it a side benefit to being a cop. But it's this incident that damages his relationship with Ann almost permanently and it takes many revelations on the murders to bring them back together again.

This movie is very detailed in portraying the deeds of the New Orleans Police Department that corrupted it for so long. It also works to make Remy and Ann's relationship believable. The mix of a cop with poor judgment and a coy lawyer creates great sparks and it comes off realistic.  Both Quaid and Barkin have excellent chemistry and definitely display the best of their acting ability. Barkin works well to show Ann struggling with her feelings. You can see she really cares about Remy but his hand in the corruption weighs heavily upon her mind. And Quaid falls almost naturally into Remy's role, shining his bright smile and showing how much he cares for Ann and for his family as well.

This is a definite must for fans of crime drama, but it's like a mix of genres. It's the type of movie for everyone. Don't bother renting it, it's better bought.",1116720000,,2280,4.732997481108312

Parts are fairly predictable, but on the whole it's not a bad movie.",1112054400,,388,4.47887323943662
1002248,1,6305262268,"Let me begin by saying that it took me three times to finish this film.  I am a strong believer that if a film takes three days to finish, or you find yourself constantly glancing at your watch, then the film has lost you. You are not interested in the movie any longer, all you want is for the film to end.  Quick and simple, you have better things to do today.

To begin, I couldn't stand Quaid's accent.  I realize that we are deep into the world of Louisiana, but it almost felt forced from Quaid.  It felt as if he had been practicing all night, only to forget most of it in the morning and continue to ""try"" to do his best.  Second, the chemistry between Barkin and Quaid seems forced as well.  Neither one of them seem to be in love, it just seems like it is more a convenience relationship then a full fledged love affair.  I have trouble believing that a couple is going to be happy together after just spending an evening together at a bar OR that a love could form when you are trying to convict the man on corruption charges.  I felt that some sort of ethics question should have been brought up, but it wasn't.

The secondary characters in this film made no sense either. I didn't care, or know, who Bob, Dick, or Jane were in the background of this film. I did notice John Goodman playing a small part ... but he has done better.  I felt that with this film, the director had swayed from the overall point of the film.  Jim McBride tried to bring a story of romance with the backdrop of crime in the unlikely of places.  What was actually created was a ""gumbo"" style of film.  Tons of different elements combined in the same bowl, only to create some sense of spice and uneven texture.

I think something was missing when they were trying to establish a sense of family bond between all the major characters, but I still didn't realize that Ned Beatty was trying to marry Quaid's mother. In the middle of the film that hit me hard ... too hard.  I felt at times that this film was similar to watching a very cheap, and un-mutant like version of X-Men. I could see Quaid doing Gambit, but it would have been sloppy and poor.  Perhaps I was hoping that somewhere in the middle of this film Quiad would turn into Gambit and perhaps ... just perhaps ... throw some of those explosive cards at everyone around him.  Chaos could have been better created than this film.

Finally, I would like to end on a note of science. If you are in a big gun battle at the very end, the climax is about to come (as horrible as that just sounded), and the last of the bad guys is about to get their come-uppins please DO NOT ever shoot at bags of cocaine. Do you know why? Because they will explode upon impact of any bullets.  Did you know that?  I would have to say that that is the only history I learned, or was willing to learn, during this film.

ps... also if the title of your film is The Big Easy try not to allow your main character to use it in every line that he has. It will not, nor has it ever, worked in cinema.

I have viewed this movie and will continue to do so, it's just that sort of a good time. I absolutely adore New Orleans, and you get some good scenery and even better cajun music (though where is Doug Kershaw??? I ask!), with excellent supporting performances from John Goodman and Ned Beatty.
Dennis plays Remy McSwain, a police Lieutenant that loves the Big Easy and takes everything in laid back stride, until problems arise. There is a supposed drug war going on, he thinks he has all the answers until Burkin's ADA Anne Osbourne starts asking questions of her own. Their attraction is instantaneous, sexy and fun, as she knows she cannot fall for the man she is investigating, but she cannot seem to stop herself.
Uncle Souse tells Barkin's character at once point ""put your purdy face in the car, cher.""....well, put your purdy face in front of the telly and enjoy a trip down to Dr. John's way.
Please note that is Jim Garrison playing Jim Garrison!! For those who do not recall the name, see Oliver Stone's JFK.
Mature audiences as there is one sexy, steaming love scene between the leads (which they said they had trouble doing since they were friends in real life - well, it sure does not show!!!)
Look out for the gator, baby!!!",1046217600,64,1863,4.580838323353293

  The story is kind of hokey, and the acting is a little subpar, but being a fan of the city of New Orleans... I couldn't help but be anamored of the way they use the city and the fantastic coordination of the soundtrack... enhancing the overall feeling of things.
  Dennis Quaid has been better, but he's fun to watch, as a young detective who comes face-to-face with the true meaning of graft and corruption.
  I like the overall feeling of the film.  I love the town and the state of Louisiana... how every day seems like a party and the simplicity of the hours.
  Maybe the film wasn't great... but it is a great reminder of the days I spent in Louisiana last year and how much I want to go back!!!

1002318,5,6305262268,"For a fifteen year old film, this movie is almost as fresh and sizzling as it was in the year of its release.  (The only pass thing I saw in the film was the use of the occasional typewriter rather than a computer...but it was back in 1987, so it's easy to overlook that!)
Dennis Quaid is perfectly cast as Remy McSwain, ...  Quaid manages to make the change from charming rogue to conflicted cop who wants to do right seamless.  This is probably because Quaid easily infuses the character with hard to resist likeability, even when you know he has done wrong.  In watching Quaid, it's apparent that the role of Remy fit him to a T...and he had a lot of fun bringing him to life.
Adding to Quaid's dead on characterization is Ellen Barkin as Anne Osborne.  Anne is as uptight as Remy is laid back...but both balance each other out, and bring new facets to the other.  ...
The above characters are really what the movie is about.  Because, though the backdrop of the movie is about corruption and murder, the true entertainment comes from watching the electric chemistry between Quaid and Barkin.  ...
Besides Barkin and Quaid, a stellar supporting cast includes Lisa Jane Persky as Det. McCabe, Ned Beatty (as Remy's father-figure/captain, Grace Zabriskie as Mrs. McSwain - Remy's mother, and a great performance by John Goodman as Andr, a fellow cop.
The final ingredient is the music.  With a nice selection of a cajun-flavored slant in the soundtrack, the ""true"" star of the film, New Orleans, is adequately highlighted and its charm done justice, not to mention a great song by Aaron Neville tossed in for all that romantic tension.  :)
All in all, this movie deserved much more success than it had.  It's a wonderful way to pass the time if you just want some romance...or to experience the magic of New Orleans.",1031443200,8,1817,4.629283489096573
1002319,5,6305262268,"You don't have to be cajun to enjoy this really fine piece of movie making and acting. I don't know how I have ever missed this film before, anyway the fact it was made in '87 adds a litlle real nostalgia! Further, it was nice to see it on DVD. There's great local New Orleans atmosphere and great chemistry between the principle actors. It's got pace and even though the plot is a little fudged it didn't matter since I got the drift. I have jogged along those same levees as Ellen Barkin jogs in the movie (she plays the beautiful D.A.) If you are at a loss when renting, and heavens knows the pickings of current releases is way slim, grab this movie - on DVD. In fact, I shall probably add it to my collection.",1012780800,,714,4.218978102189781
1002320,5,6305262268,"Dennis Quaid is Remy McSwain, a New Orleans police detective with good intentions and bad habits. Along with most of his coworkers, Remy has been on the take ""in little bitty ways"" since his first day on the job. He's a good cop from a family of cops, but Remy just considers free meals and extra cash for overlooking minor violations to be the perks of a thankless and dangerous job. New Assistant D.A. Anne Osborne is going to change all that. As Remy investigates a string of murders that look every bit like a mob war, Anne investigates Remy and the rest of the police force. It's her belief that the police may be behind the apparently motiveless killings. As the two find themselves working together on the case, Anne finds Remy's cocky, Cajun charm more and more irresistible, and she eventually succumbs to his romantic advances. Things seem to be going quite well for them, until Remy gets caught on camera taking a bribe. Even though Remy gets off, thanks to a problem with the video evidence, it will take some work to restore his budding relationship with Anne. Fortunately, their passion for seeing the suspicious murders solved and the cops that are responsible, if any, brought to justice is just the thing to bring them back together.

""The Big Easy"" is a 1980s classic that eventually found its way onto my list of favorite films some ten years or so ago. Now, I'm not one for pure cop films or shows. They're just not interesting enough for me most of the time. However, ""The Big Easy"" is not just another cop film. In truth, it's a love story that just happens to be set to a cop film background. Still, that alone isn't very appealing to me either. What makes this film work, in addition to the fantastic cast, is the setting itself, New Orleans, The Big Easy. Watch any good film set in New Orleans and you'll notice a unique flavor that, if the flavor appeals to you, will keep your interest throughout. The accents, the music, the visuals, but mostly the music, are simply wonderful! There's no shortage of great music in ""The Big Easy,"" and even Dennis Quaid chimes in with a song! Yes, the real stars of ""The Big Easy"" are the music and the city of New Orleans itself, but one can't discount Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin, or their steamy onscreen romance! Both do a fantastic job as Remy and Anne, and, of course, without them there would be no movie! Ned Beatty, John Goodman, and Gailard Sartain are also among the brilliant cast of this unique film that spawned a USA Network TV series several years later! So, don't hesitate to pick this one up! It's a must see, whether you decide you love it or not, and don't be put off by the cover. Yes, there's a love scene or two, but the DVD art is a bit misleading. It's not the Cinemax After Dark film it is made out to be by the cover image. This is just a great movie, simple as that! The DVD is widescreen and offers the humorously dated theatrical trailer, plus cast bios. A must for the DVD collection of any true film lover!",1007424000,,3003,4.450090744101633

Young Dennis Quaid in good performance. Female protagonist Ellen Barkin in a discrete way. Female role remembers Madonna. With Madonna and Quaid the picture could be better.
