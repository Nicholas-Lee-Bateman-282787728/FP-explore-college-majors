8316733,5,B001KZN2OA,"Two very good films for Renee Zellweger  fans (and others too !).  I'm not a fan of musicals (can't remember the last one I watched), but ""Chicago"" is quite different and quite good, winner of Best Motion Picture Award from both the Oscars and Golden  Globes.  Acting outstanding : Oscar to Catherine Zeta-Jones for Best Supporting Actress, nominations to three others, including Zellweger for Best Leading Actress.  Golden Globe winners included Zellweger for Best Leading Actress in a comedy or musical, and Richard Gere for Best Actor;  nominations  to three others, including Zeta-Jones for Best Supporting Actress. An actress/actor's film about ""Murderess Row""  in 1920's Chicago.
""A Price Above Rubies"" is a gem of a story about the risks and rewards of  seeking personal freedom vs. living the  expected norm. Zellweger lives the conforming life of a young woman in a Jewish community, but finds neither  happiness nor fulfillment there, so she explores beyond the societal boundaries that hold her tightly.  Well done drama all-around.

Getting two great movies (new in box) for the rock bottom price of one is a nice find any day, = another good deal  from Amazon!",1449878400,2,1173,5.0732984293193715
