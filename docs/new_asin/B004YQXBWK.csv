8448749,5,B004YQXBWK,"Since this title looked suspiciously familiar, I did a little research and found that this is a re-issue of the excellent ""La Guerre d' Algerie,"" by directors Yves Courriere and Phillippe Monnier. It was released in France in March 1972 and later released to English speaking viewers in 1975. It has been re-released a few more times since and I recall watching portions of this excellent documentary on a PBS channel in the late 1980s. The original was 4 hours and 40 minutes long, but this version is divided into four sets, each with three DVDs ranging between 104 and 150 minutes of viewing time. As I recall, it provides not only a history of the conflict, but its origins, and shows contemporary news footage of the conflict as well as interviews from the various participants, journalists who covered this conflict, and political advisors of the time from the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) to the office of French President De Gaulle.

The documentary was originally released only 10 years after the end of the war when the conflict was still fresh on the minds of both the French and the Algerians as well as other participants. According to the IMBd, ""cobblestones were thrown at the faade of the Saint-Sverin Cinema as a screening of ""La guerre d'Algrie"" took place in Paris on 22nd October 1971"". The war still has a bitter impact on both countries to this day. It was not until 1999 that the Algerian War was allowed to be taught in French public schools.

This whole tragedy might possibly had been averted as late as only five years before the war had France recognized the Algerians as French citizens and bestowed all the rights of citizenship. However, many French politicians feared that French culture would be deluded and become Moslem oriented, and would result in a shift of political power. They were supported by the Pied Noir, the French citizens of Algeria, for whom the status quo gave them political and economical advantage over the native Algerians. The end result was tragic.

An observation I may want to add is that we Americans view this sad episode as just another hopeless colonial war. However, for the French, Algeria was France and was considered another department of Metropolitan France no different than one of the 50 States of our Union. Therefore, a majority of the French people viewed it as a war no different as if Texas or California decided it wanted to secede from the U.S. and become independent. The French tried to convince NATO to enter the war claiming that Metropolitan France was being attacked by an insurgency supported by an external threat - Nasser's Egypt and the Soviets. The Eisenhower Administration refused to buy that line of thinking and voted against it. This added just another reason for resentment and mistrust by the soon to be elected President Charles de Gaulle and would have significant ramifications on American-French relations within the decade following the war.",1410566400,,2954,4.904
8448750,5,B004YQXBWK,"This is the first part of a great documentary series on France's war in Algeria. The documentary was done years ago for British television. Its exceptional in terms of the historical work done, the obscurity of much of the history to the english speaking world and the natural drama of the story itself.

The first part for obvious reasons has to cover the most ground. It covers the developement of French Algeria from the early days in the 1800s through world war II and up to the beginning of the insurgency. Much of the coverage is rather thin, but despite the gaps its all still well done.",1396224000,3,594,4.5514018691588785
8448751,5,B004YQXBWK,"I have been reading and collecting books about the Algerian War for over thirty years.  Other than Hollywood's ""Lost Command"" and Pontocorvo's ""Battle of Algiers"", I have never seen film images of the Algerian conflict.  This three volume DVD series on the Algerian War was produced in Great Britain in the mid-1080's.  In tone, the series reminds me of the classic ""World at War"" series.  The Algerian War combines original film footage and the recollections of the war's participants.  It is powerful to see men and women in their late middle age and senior years describing disturbing events that took place in their youth.  This is a great documentary series that shows the war from both the French and Algerian point of view.  Highly recommended!",1377734400,2,751,4.96
