8055575,5,B00083H8WW,"Having already purchased Doo Wop 50, 51 & Rock, Rhythm & Doo Wop I thought I had the complete concerts.  Not so.  I was a little upset that there were performances missing from these disks. Having said that, the disk itself is a must for lovers of this music.  The quality and sound are excellent.  A must-have for any collector.",1339718400,,329,4.433333333333334
8055576,4,B00083H8WW,"A little hit and miss, but mostly excellent.  Hank Ballard, Little Richard, the Tokens, and the Dells stand out as simply terrific.  If you have the series, this is a must.",1256169600,3,172,4.516129032258065
