5256986,4,B00945ID2E,"This is an interesting film for a few reasons. It stars Yvonne De Carlo in this English language version. I believe there is a verison in Italian as well. The film is based on the biblical character Mary Magdalene, played by De Carlo. However, it adds in fictionalized accounts. One interesting note is that this film marks a rare on-screen appearance by Yvonne De Caro's husand Robert (Bob) Morgan. Usually a stuntman behind the scenes, Morgan has a small acting role here and even one short scene with De Carlo. Enjoyable!",1372723200,6,524,4.769230769230769

8535579,2,B00945ID2E,"Very poor print. Sometimes quite out of focus. Possibly the movie to watch when you have had one too many. Then it might come into focus. A ""B"" movie of biblical proportions that doesn't really hold your interest.",1459209600,,213,4.631578947368421
8535580,1,B00945ID2E,"The cover art is for an entirely different movie made in 1956 and starring Gianna Maria Canale.  This film also has the title ""The Sword and the Cross, and is AKA ""Slave of Carthage.""  The IMDB has an entry with this problem, which doubtless adds to the confusion.",1444262400,,264,4.479166666666667
8535581,3,B00945ID2E,"It's always nice to see lovely Yvonne de Carlo but my reason for purchasing this movie is the wonderful Rossana Podesta who I've been in love with since ""Helen of Troy. I naturally enjoyed it, but unless you're into sword and sandals I can't honestly recommend it. By the way, the poster used to illustrate this movie is for another film entirely.",1439251200,,347,4.612903225806452

8535583,3,B00945ID2E,"This movie is not that bad. The story was changed about Mary Magdelan , and they  made Barabbas  into a central figure in her life.  The movie despite all of the twists and turns in the plot has a good cast of Peplum Film regulars. Yvonne De Carlo's dance sequence is very good. Production values are pretty decent, but there is a widescreen version of this rare film. I wish that Amazon would get a hold of it, because their version  they show leaves much to be desired.",1433721600,2,471,4.318181818181818
