Good for some mindless entertainment. Not a lot of thought went into the plot so don't worry about having to look for some underlying story line. Not to be a spoiler, but there is none.

bad and apparently the producers did not have the resources to even hire extras to cover up the bad acting.

Not super bad for a low budget film. It looks a lot like the SCA or another fantasy group played in it. The actors aren't super good but not super bad either.

6427384,1,B00KH6JMD8,"A very low budget movie in which the makers did things such as use an obviously very small number of people to try to make crowds.  The ""crowd"" scene at King Arthur's funeral is a cross between laughable and pitiful.  Of course according to the Arthur cannons, Arthur had no funeral.  This movie uses names such as Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin, Morgan le Fay, etc. the way old westerns used Jessie James, Wyatt Earp, Buffalo Bill, etc.  That is there is little relationship to actual history or legend.  All of this could have been forgivable if the movie was entertaining.  Alas it is not.",1466294400,3,597,4.6923076923076925
6427385,4,B00KH6JMD8,"Ok, so it's a pretty low budge fastest flick that is pendant best enjoyed when you're not in the mood for something that requires a lot of thought. The acting is mostly horrible, and the story really didn't make much sense, but it's a not-to-deep fantasy that asks you to only look at the primary colors. Arthurian enthusiasts will probably find it angering, but for those looking for a relaxing fantasy with very general themes it's not too bad. The woman playing Morgan le fey has an interesting accent and really tries to be someone, as a result, her interplay with a very limp Merlin is entirely one sided. It's a bit like if someone's parents decided to pretend to be Guinevere and Lancelot and somehow got funding for a movie. For stars because it's exactly what it tries to be.",1466208000,3,784,4.567375886524823

Galahad and the last of the remaining knights must go out and find Lancelot, who's been in exile... and then must return to defend Camelot...
