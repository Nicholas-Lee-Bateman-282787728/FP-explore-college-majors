8188886,4,B000P4X21K,"Another little gem of a disc from the source of ""Thunderbean"" - who must  now be established as an important area for collectors, like me, to gain access to rare vintage theatrical cartoons - like Volume 2 of their Cultoons  series ""Rare,Lost and Strange Cartoons"" for instance,  13 B&W./Colour Films with a running time of 108 minutes - with extras! . These particular cartoons focus on animated advertisements and educational films from 1929 - 1951 with great effect and clarity.  The DVD Disc in question does come in DVD-R format, but plays well.  Recommended. Ronald Alexander-Mace (London)",1244937600,6,595,5.092783505154639
8188887,5,B000P4X21K,"Thunderbean returns to the vaults and delivers another installment of Cultoons!  This time, we learn a little something with Volume 2: Animated Education.  From animation that shows how sound works, a cartoon that shows the benefits of drinking milk, shorts on safety and race relations plus many many more, this collection is entertaining and insightful.

The restoration work is great and shows that a lot of patience and love went into this DVD.

Great job Thunderbean!!!!",1184457600,10,475,5.2105263157894735
8188888,5,B000P4X21K,"If you're a cartoon buff who craves unseen rarities this collection is for you!

The shorts included span a period of time from the dawn of the sound era up through the impressionistic 'fifties.  Education, Commerce and Entertainment collide to provide a very satisfying viewing experience.  The bonus ""commentary jams"" from some of the most respected names in animation archaelogy make for a fun listen, as well.

Well, done, Thunderbean.  Thanks for caring.  Thanks for sharing!

I am looking forward to Volume Three...",1176249600,12,521,5.204819277108434
