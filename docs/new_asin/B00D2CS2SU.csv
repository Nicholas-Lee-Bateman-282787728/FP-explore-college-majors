8588510,1,B00D2CS2SU,AWFUL!!! Save your money and your time!,1525392000,,39,4.714285714285714
8588511,5,B00D2CS2SU,"I found the print to be well within acceptable quality and not nearly as bad as other reviews made it out to be. The same is true of the soundtrack and the subtitles; neither were so poor as to warrant an ""unwatchable"" comment. I know that I second guessed my purchase of this several times before finally buying, based solely upon the warnings in the reviews I read. I'm happy to report that the criticism is unfounded; or at the very least, greatly exaggerated.

The film itself is rather short, but packs a lot into the time. The footage used of earlier films is eerie, needing to be seen to be fully appreciated. And the consultants interviewed kept things lively and on topic. If this topic interests you, buy this without concern. It will be a welcome and worthwhile addition to your documentary shelf.",1518739200,,808,4.611111111111111
8588512,1,B00D2CS2SU,"not even worth a 1 star rating, so boring. I saw an hour animated version of Dante's Inferno that was leaps and bounds more entertaining",1408147200,,136,4.48
8588513,2,B00D2CS2SU,"There is some great content here, but the sound is so badly edited and produced as to render it virtually unwatchable at times.

The film consists of descriptions of the various chapters of the Inferno, with readings, opinions and lectures from a number of professors, fans and actors. Most of these commentators are interesting people and they raise interesting perspectives on the work. This commentary is presented sometimes as talking heads and sometimes as pure audio accompanied by various black-and-white artwork. Overall the visual direction is sound, and the general feel is somewhat like attending a lecture on the piece by an interesting professor.

Unfortunately, the production is plagued by some very serious technical issuesparticularly in the audio. There is frequent digital clipping throughout the film, and the speakers are often difficult or impossible to understand as a result. Throughout the entire discussion of the second level of Hell, there's an extremely loud and grating wind noise that makes all the dialog completely inaudible. It's not just hard to hear: it's literally impossible to understand the speakers in much of this section. (However, the sound effect is so annoying that you'd probably want to mute your speakers even if you could hear through it.)

In another mistake, the editor frequently overlays a person's name right on top of the subtitles of that person's speech, meaning that you can't read the text that explains what he or she is saying.

For a film that consists primarily of listening to people speak, it's clearly quite frustrating when you can't understand them for stretches of time. I believe most viewers will be frustrated by this, so I can't recommend the film. However, if you're academically minded, interested in the topic and the idea of a series of readings and miniature lectures sounds attractive, I won't recommend *against* watching this.

I wanted to really like this. There's some four and five-star content hidden behind its technical flaws. It's a shame that these problems have injured it so much. If the audio was remixed with a bit more skill and care, it would easily rate four stars. As it stands, I can't go above 2 stars: it was just too frustrating to not be able to tell what the people were saying.",1406419200,4,2282,5.042440318302387
8588514,5,B00D2CS2SU,All the speakers were excellent but Joyce is always incredible. Joyce has a fantastic amount if knowledge on Mythology and is a leader in the Campbell movement. She adds class whenever she speaks.,1392595200,,196,4.96969696969697
8588515,1,B00D2CS2SU,Sound is completely horrible. Avoid this one. It is a very amateur production with limited scholarly value. Find another Dante doc . Preferably one not made by Hollywood junkie evangelicals.,1389830400,,190,5.366666666666666
8588516,5,B00D2CS2SU,"I very much enjoyed this film.  It takes the viewer on a gruesome but compelling journey through Dante's levels of hell.  Through graphic imagery, frightening vintage film, engaging music, and clear explanations and interpretations the film leads you easily through the epic of Dante.

This is a good length for this film - not too long, not too short.",1388188800,,352,4.932203389830509
8588517,5,B00D2CS2SU,"This is a really well organized and concise documentary on Dante's Inferno. The only documentary I know about on Dante's Inferno. I was amazed at how incredible Dore Illustrations look on the screen and how well they were used to follow the narrator and speakers throughout the film. Hollywood legend, Jeff Conaway did a great narration and sounds like it was the right choice for the off camera voice. This later version even has clips of the first Italian feature film ""L'Inferno"" (1911), which look restored and fascinating. If you are a Dante lover or need help in understanding the poem, don't think twice and buy this DVD. If you never read The Divine Comedy, this film will open your eyes as to why Dante Alighieri is considered the best Italian poet of all time. Gotta see it!!!

Here is another great film (animation) by the same director based on Dante's Inferno:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dante-s-Hell-Animated/dp/B00CROA55M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dante's Hell Animated</a>",1375228800,,1037,5.6050955414012735
8588518,5,B00D2CS2SU,"Boris Acosta's film is a concise and frightening look at Dante's vision of hell, as interpreted by famous actors and academics from both Italy and the US. Wonderfully illustrated and filmed, a must-see for those new to Dante and scholars alike.",1269129600,9,244,4.975609756097561
