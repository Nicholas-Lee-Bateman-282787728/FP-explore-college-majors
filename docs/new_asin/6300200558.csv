A five star episode so ignore previous reviews that say otherwise.",1382659200,,325,4.927272727272728
7805307,2,6300200558,"This has to be the weakest of the Prisoner episodes, a show I loved.
SHOW BACKGROUND: A man (Patrick Mcgoohan) we've never met resigns from an unidentified ministry (described in a montage that ran over the opening credits; from his history, it's clear his history has been a stormy one). Before he can escape, and never having explained his reasons for leaving, he is kidnapped and whisked off to a strange prison - the village.  Seemingly idyllic, The Village is actually a prison - lined by invisible borders patrolled by a mysterious baloonlike creature.  The Village's colorful setting don't conceal a crushing totalitarian state designed to wear down the resolve of its inmates and force them to submit to its authority.  Nobody has names - only numbers, and nothing distinguishes the guards from the prisoners.  Presiding over the village is the mysterious and never seen ""Number One"".  Instead, our hero - labled as No. 6 - must deal with the second in command (no. 2 of course).  No. 6, despite being the hero, is also an enigma - his real name is never revealed.  We don't know what agency he worked for, though it becomes clear that it involved espionage (speculation that No. 6 is actually John Drake, the hero of the ""Secret Agent"" series, and that ""The Prisoner"" is actually a sequel to that older show, remain subjects for the cult followers of each show; though we may never know for certain, it's generally accepted that both shows are spy thrillers sharing a very anti-Bond darkness).  We ofcourse know why he's left - numbed to death by the bureaucracy of the job (""I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, briefed, de-briefed or numbered!!""), but his former superiors suspect that he's gone to the other side.  Number 2 has two jobs specific to Number 6 - get him to both explain why he resigned and also to conform to the mindless existence of The Village.  Because No. 6 manages to outwit his captors on a regular basis (narrowly though), the position of No. 2 is rotating.
In this outer, the newest No. 2 decides on a frontal attack.  ""You must be hammer or anvil"", No. 2 tells our hero immediately.  Being No. 2, he also gets to choose which of the roles he'll play ""I will hammer you!"".  Unfortunately, the direct approach is the poor one (The No. 2 played by Leo Mckern of ""Rumpole"" fame was far more sucessful using more subtle techniques).  Had he boned-up on Orwell, No. 2 would have remembered that, despite the beating it takes, the Anvil actually wins the battle because it can withstand more punishment than the hammer can inflict - a point No. 6 proves when he goes on his counterattack.  Avoiding direct confrontation, No. 6 begins acting oddly, appearing to listen for secret messages in newly arrived records, appearing to send out some of his own - appearing to have contact with the outside world and likely with No. 2's superiors.
This was a weak episode because it lacks that quality of the best episodes to keep us guessing until the end.  In great episodes like ""Chimes of Big Ben"" or ""Checkmate"" we're on edge wondering where No. 6 went wrong (because he had to) - wondering which prisoner is really the guard who betrayed him, or what last minute error by No. 2 would disable their plans.  Instead, the No. 2 here is immediately put on the defensive, and its downhill from then on.  Instead, get those other episodes, especially the climactic ""Fallout"".",1046563200,,3395,4.6964586846543
