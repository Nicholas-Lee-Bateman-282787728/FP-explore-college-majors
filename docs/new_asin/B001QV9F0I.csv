8336514,5,B001QV9F0I,"I loved watching the movie. In the beginning I had a small problem with sound, so instead of watching the DVD on a regular DVD player, I watched it on X-box player. It's a very interesting movie, I liked it! Evgeniy Leonov, who played the main hero Oreshnikov (the photographer) - is one of the greatest actors of Soviet era. He played in famous movies, like ""Gentlemen of Fortune"", ""Mimino""(small episode) or ""Kind-Dza-Dza"", etc. This movie is good to watch with the family. Too pity, there's no English subtitles, only Russian soundtrack.",1274054400,,540,4.880434782608695
