6016448,5,B00FOLGVRQ,I really enjoyed this movie. Woman takes her daughter in order to flee an abusive husband. She is successful in hiding from him for 10 years until her husband stumbles across info and tracks them down. Action is fast paced and well acted. Sean Patrick Flanery is great as the new fianc who had no clue that the woman he loves has a dark past.,1389916800,,342,4.276923076923077

8617432,1,B00FOLGVRQ,"We had low expectations  for this movie but thought it might be worthwhile because we like the Palm Springs locale.  It wasn't worth our time.  As others have stated, the basic plot has been overworked already.  Far worse, the ""good guys"" kept doing things that no thinking person would really do, and the twists, especially the ending, were incredibly ridiculous.",1420416000,,364,5.016666666666667
8617433,5,B00FOLGVRQ,It came right on time and I'm glad to have it,1417737600,,45,3.1818181818181817
8617434,2,B00FOLGVRQ,"The movie was more like a B movie,
and I just did not know that would have been the case.
Was not worth the time I took to view it...",1402876800,,133,3.466666666666667
8617435,4,B00FOLGVRQ,Nobody thought about lynn at all in the film.  She did not deserve what happened to her.  Selfish bitch could not take her one right away.,1393632000,,138,4.269230769230769
8617436,3,B00FOLGVRQ,"I purchased this movie hoping it would be a different twist on a  repeatedly done theme. NOT.... same story of mother and daughter leaving abusive relationship,  being stalked by abuser, and yes...you can fill in the rest. It even lacks the suspense and "" hold your breathe"" scenes that the majority of these type of movies have. So if you want to see a drama, maybe worth the investment, but if you are looking for a suspensful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing, don't buy.",1393632000,,502,4.5054945054945055
