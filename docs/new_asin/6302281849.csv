448801,5,6302281849,"Saying a Welles film is a masterpiece is pretty silly at this point. It is encouraging that people in the US are waking up to the fact that the dominant view of Welles (one hit wonder who then produced a string of forgettable garbage) is ABSURD!! I believe that this movie is more revolutionary than Kane. The emergence of artifice, combined with the dark comedic undertone is the beginning of a process that ultimately led to Godard, Pasolini, and Oshima (read: and everyone else of interest to lesser degrees).
Welles apparently read Brecht's article about Chinese theatre and the Alienation Effect right before filming this and the results are staggering. The whole concept of the drama is turned inside out: rather than submit the work to be considered by the audience, the film turns the viewer's attention instead to the concept of reality and reveals it to be a threadbare patchwork production put on by hucksters and charlatans who vie for the right to determine how events will be interpreted. The climactic scene in the court room brings it all to a head as Bannister cross examines himself and then Michael's fate (for murder) ends up hinging on a kiss (seduction=damnation). The story about Cohn offering to pay anyone who could explain the plot is perfect: the whole point of this movie is that the plot is a construct that was used to sucker the protagonist and he was so busy being seduced, he didn't notice that it was absurd. From here you can draw a direct line to 'Kiss Me Deadly', one of the last great statements in this genre (along w/'Touch of Evil').
Welles was not only one of the great artists of the century, his works contain limitless philosophical depth.",973036800,20,1684,4.750853242320819
448802,4,6302281849,"This is a good movie ( not Welles' best ) The DVD picuture quality is excellent.  Inspite of trimming of 60 minutes, the movie is easy to follow.

448804,5,6302281849,"Even though the story can be confusing, (probably due to Harry Cohn's meddling--Welles was quite a showman and storyteller but not a popular man in Hollywood), this film easily earns five stars for its unforgettable  style.",958953600,2,223,5.194444444444445
448805,5,6302281849,"The first time the scheming heart-of-ice blonde Rita Hayworth kisses the Irish in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound adventurer Orson Welles in this excellent b&w masterpiece, she chooses an aquarium to do it,watched by  barracudas, sharks and an evil Moray eel.  At this stage of the proceedings  the viewer is pretty well convinced Mr Welles has a better chance among the  fish than among the people. But there's more.  As the lovers kiss,a class  of giggling school girls spots them who are promptly shepherded away by a  vigilant elderly female school teacher. A moment later the schoolteacher's  colleague, another elderly female, takes a peek, screeching as she is  dragged off "" I wanta see I WANTA SEE!"" These furies pursue Mr  Welles into his trial and provide crucial evidence that he was indeed  kissing the Mrs Everett Sloane. Mr Sloane, a rich and brilliant criminal  lawyer, not only acts as defence for Mr Welles, but also stands as a  witness for the prosecution. He then cross examines himself! . Yes.  You're right, dear viewer, this is an absurd and topsy turvy world we are  observing. Deep focus, wierd angles, shadows, super-close ups,  idiosyncratic dialogue with mad people operating in a corrupt and absurd  universe, make this a vivid and rich cinematic experience. Never in  cinematic history has the word ""lover"" been spat,as it is  frequently by Mr Everett Sloane, when addressing his wife Ms Hayworth, with  so much poison as it is here, in this film. Nothing is what it seems, with  references to cinema history, including German Expressionism, and this film  is a must see.  Good fun too, especially the mad Glenn Anders.",957052800,8,1645,5.033457249070632
448806,3,6302281849,"As with ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" some six years previous, director Welles ran into some difficulties with the studio regarding the original cut of the movie, which they said was too long.  In those days  there were frequently double or triple bills with two or three movies  shown, and theater owners were hesitant to show movies that were longer  than an hour and a half.  The cut Welles submitted to the studio was about  100 minutes long, where the released version runs at 87 minutes.  Details  are scarce as to the nature of the cut scenes.  Perhaps it would have added  more character development--my problem with the film was too much suspense  and not enough character--I disliked ""The Stranger"" because it  had too much character and not enough suspense--something like ""Touch  of Evil"" or ""Macbeth"" has a nice balance...  I would aggree  that this is not one of Welles' best, however a bad Orson Welles movie is  generally around the artistic level of midgrade Hitchcock and better than  five movies made by any other filmmaker before 1969.  Now stop reading and  go buy this thing now: the Hall of Mirrors Scene at the end is more than  worth the purchase price.  The original cut may have been better.  We'll  never know.  According to rumor on Internet, the cut footage was burned in  1948 due to pressure from Hearst.",952560000,7,1334,4.770925110132159

The dialogue is clever, amusing, and powerful. The themes of the film are well carried from beginning to end. The end, oh my goodness the end. Everyone has seen it imitated, whether they realize it or not. It has a remarkable twist that still leaves you hypothesizing about what was happening throughout the plot. Hayworth is incomparable to any actress of the era. Wells plays a strong and cynical character, while his narration tells you that he's foolish.

Probably, given numerous moments of terrifically wry comedy amid the lurid melodrama.  As an Orson Welles creation, it's the cinematography that absolutely dazzles.  Pay more  attention to the cinematography & editing than the plot (and Orson's ridiculous Irish accent); also hear the incredible soundtrack...the musical interplay is woven at levels of wildly artistic jigsaw genius; and the exotic noir atmospheres & moods are very impressive...even the sense of actors being ""too close"" to the camera with their wet mouths & sweaty faces...trigger gut reactions of gleeful revulsion from viewers.  The chaotic climaxes that complete the film are exhilarating, even psychedelic (courtroom & amusement park).  For many years I avoided sitting through this film, but now that I gave it a chance...I would place it at the very pinnacle of Orson Welles productions.",1463356800,,1011,5.401273885350318

449062,4,6302281849,"Of course, LfS is amazing. Of course. To call it a great ""film noir"" is really not as accurate statement as it is to call it a great Orson Welles film. Great noir? How about ""Out of the Past"" or ""Laura""? But here is my problem with LfS. It starts out a bit kooky -- perhaps the print I was watching also had issues in the first reel -- and then settles in during the boat ride, and then gets pretty vanilla Noir once it hits San Fran. The plot, most of the writing and of course the acting (and direction) are vintage Welles, and therefore remarkable. But I found myself constantly thinking about ""lesser"" films that were probably greater Noirs: ""Double Indemnity"", and even one of my faves: ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"". The latter is I think a better tale (story) because of the great James M Cain source material. As great a director and actor as Welles was, he was not a great writer, at least not as great as the greatest screenwriters in Hollywood history.

The private lives of the two stars at the time of filming of the The Lady from Shanghai (1947) are much more intriguing than the plot line of this so-so noir.  The film felt very theater-like oriented, and the accent of Michael O'Hara is terribly annoying...borderline--retarded.  The only positive aspects that I found were: Hayworth's sex-appeal and the final scene in the fun-house. Not many people know--- but, Orson was married to Hayworth at the time of filming.  Two years later, however Hayworth gave birth to daughter, whom she had with a Syrian prince.  The two stars also died 2 years apart from each other...Orson in 1985 and Hayworth in 1987.

In any case I just caught it again at our local art house theatre and wow, does it hold up well. It just seems to get better over the years, and for me, Ive not had that much trouble following the much commented upon convoluted story. Glenn Anders more or less steals the show as Grisby, but all the performances are strong. One of the things I like about Lady is that Welles takes the dark noir universe and pretty much turns it on its head, at least visually. Here the most arresting scenes are outside in the bright sun, especially those in Acapulco. He even had Rita Hayworth change her hair color from deep red to blonde, then made her cut it short for good measure, apparently to the horror of Columbia studio boss Harry Cohn. Look fast for Errol Flynn in a cameo.

Baffling murders, fascinating plot twists and remarkable camera work all contribute to this spellbinding, time-honoured film noir written, directed by and starring Orson Welles. Hired to work on a yacht belonging to the disabled husband of femme fatale Rita Hayworth, Welles plays an innocent man drawn into a dangerous web of intrigue and murder.

The subject of great controversy and scandal upon its initial release, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI shocked 1948 audiences by presenting Rita Hayworth with her flaming red hair cut short and dyed  champagne blonde. Fifty years later, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is considered vintage Orson Welles, especially with his famous hall of mirrors climax hailed as one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Based on the novel If I Die Before I Wake.

FILM FACT: Other scenes were filmed in Acapulco. The yacht Zaca, on which many scenes take place, was owned by actor Errol Flynn, who skippered the yacht in between takes and can also be seen in the background in one scene at a cantina in Acapulco.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI [1948] is an imaginative, complicated, unsettling film noir who-dun-it thriller, with fascinating visuals and tilting compositions, luminous and brilliant camerawork by Charles Lawton, Jr., and numerous sub-plots and confounding plot twists. Although the tale of betrayal, lust, greed and murder was filmed in late 1946 and finished in early 1947, it wasn't released until late in 1948 and it failed both at the box-office and as a critical success and sadly there were no Academy Award nominations, which Orson Welles, was badly let down.

Irish sailor Michael O'Hara [Orson Wells] saves a beautiful woman from a robbery in Central Park; she turns out to be Elsa Bannister [Rita Hayworth], wife of the famed defence lawyer Arthur Bannister [Everett Sloane] who offers Michael O'Hara a job on his yacht, which is sailing from New York to San Francisco. During the voyage Michael O'Hara finds himself attracted to Elsa Bannister; at the same time, he becomes enmeshed in a Byzantine web of intrigue between Elsa Bannister, Arthur Bannister, and Arthur's partner George Grisby [Glenn Anders]. During a stop in Acapulco, George Grisby asks Michael O'Hara to pretend to murder him once they reach San Francisco so that he can collect his share of the insurance and run away to create a new life for himself. Michael O'Hara agrees, only to discover that he has been framed for a real murder; the only way out now is to allow none other than Arthur Bannister himself to defend his case in court.

The novel from which the film was adapted, was in fact entitled If I Die Before I Wake; in addition to that title, other working titles for the film included Black Irish and Take This Woman. William Castle, who later found fame as the producer/director of gimmicky horror films such as House on Haunted Hill [1959], The Tingler [1959] and Thirteen Ghosts [1960], already owned the rights to the book. He consequently acted as an associate producer and may have contributed to the script. Woody Allen paid homage to the famous Hall of Mirrors scene in his film Manhattan Murder Mystery [1993].

Orson Welles' rough cut of the film ran approximately 155 minutes. When it tested poorly with preview audiences, the editor Viola Lawrence, at the request of the studio, cut out over an hour of footage, bringing the film to its current length of 87 minutes. The Chinese opera sequence and the funhouse sequence were originally much more elaborate set-pieces; Welles was particularly proud of the latter and has insisted that it would have been, if anything, more memorable than the climactic shootout in the hall of mirrors. Only a few stills remain to suggest what the funhouse sequence in its entirety might have looked like. However, even more than the cuts Welles objected to the musical score, which consists largely of quotations from the song ""Please Don't Kiss Me"" which Rita Hayworth sings on the yacht.

Jump cuts in the editing, the almost Brechtian distancing effect of the stylised performances, the doubling of the film frame in the Chinese theatre scene, the deep focus that disorients by giving far backgrounds equal weight with extreme close-ups, the use of optical devices ranging from water tumblers to windshields, especially in the film's most famous set pieces, aquarium glass and multiple mirrors, all of these serve to forefront the experience of watching cinema and to push the envelope of what is expected and permissible on screen.

Whether you like the film or not, you must admit the final scenes are truly brilliant. Not only was it technically impossible Hall of Mirrors scene, where we all say however did he do it is beyond me, but also the suspenseful Chinese theatre segment, the surreal and nightmarish funhouse, and the final scene between Elsa Bannister and Michael O'Hara, in which he performs one of the most coldest and unpunished actions during the Hays code years. And the films immortal final line, Maybe I'll live so long that I'll forget her. Maybe I'll die trying.

Had this film been left in its original form, Im certain it would be Orson Welless masterpiece (hopefully someday, somehow, the lost footage will pop up, or at least the score will be replaced with the intended one). Whereas Citizen Kane manages to be visually beautiful yet still leaves one cold, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI possesses a soul, however a tragic, grotesque one. If a film can feel like an epic in only 88 minutes, imagine what the experience would have been like had it been in 150 minutes. We are never given many answers, like just what did Arthur Bannister have on Elsa Bannister, how was Elsa Bannister connected to the Chinese mafia, etc., but the mystery still keeps this film alive. However, even in its somewhat mutilated form The Lady from Shanghai remains a well-acted and stylish example of the film noir. Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders in particular stand out and the film is distinguished by its striking deep-focus and chiaroscuro cinematography and a number of offbeat touches that only a director like Orson Welles could have dreamed up.

Given Orson Welles's reputation as an embattled genius and the fact that much of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is superb, this is a film you really want to like. And one might, were Orson Welles's performance not so wretched and were the plot not as hard to navigate. All sorts of reasons have been put forward for the film's failure ranging from interference on the behalf of Harry Cohn to indifference on the part of Orson Welles. Whoever is responsible, the fact remains that this is a great film, but sadly let down by the studios 100% interference.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Powerhouse Films has given us a 4K restoration and re-mastered for Blu-ray in a stunning 1080p encoded image, the 1.37:1 aspect ratio transfer is a true thing of beauty. Not a scratch, spot, or speck of dust remains, and yet the film doesnt look overly processed at all retaining amazing sharpness and the grey scale is very rich with deep blacks and crisp whites that is a pleasure to watch just for the sheer beauty of the photography by Charles Lawton Jr., and the shadow detail is terrific, and the contrast has been applied extremely very well, but this Blu-ray edition is definitely of top quality reference all the way. The only slight visual anomaly is when we have the shoot out in the Hall of Mirrors, here you get to view a strange aspect ratio, where the whole scene has a small black border top and bottom of the screen and was wondering why Orson Welles wanted it to be viewed this way.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Powerhouse Films has given us a really special 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio sound mix that offers the sound design of its era presented without any aural artefacts. Quite a bit of the dialogue was obviously looped, so there is that arid quality that comes with extensive looping of entire scenes, but the dialogue is certainly clearly presented, but I found at times it was out of sync and very off putting and has been mixed with surety with the sound effects, but it is helped along with the interesting Heinz Roemhelds composers background music.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

4K restoration from the original negative.

Original 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio.

New and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing.

Audio Commentary with filmmaker and Orson Welles expert Peter Bogdanovich: Here we are introduced to the director Peter Bogdanovich who talks glowingly about the Orson Welles film and is totally wonderfully throughout the whole audio commentary in conjunction with the film that is packed with loads fascinating anecdotes about Orson Welles the director, who spent a lot of time with Orson Welles when compiling his book on the director. Peter Bogdanovich at the start of the film that he first met Orson Welles at the end of 1968, because Peter had written a monograph about Orson Welles for the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, New York in 1961, and sent it off to Orson Welles while he was living in Europe at the time. But out of the blue when Orson Welles happen to be in New York at the time telephoned Peter and informed him he was longing to meet him, which Peter informed Orson he was really keen to meet him as well, as he was a massive fan of all his work, so there and then Orson made an appointment to meet him the next day and Peter informs us that it was the best three hours he had ever experienced. In that meeting Orson informs him about his two films he is very proud of and those were The Stranger and The Lady From Shanghai, despite all the logistic problems he encountered and at the time of the release of The Lady From Shanghai, whenever people met Orson they would avoid talking about the film as much as possible, but when Orson went to Europe they heaped massive praise on all his films he has produced. Orson also talks about another actress that was supposed to appear as the leading lady in the film The Lady From Shanghai, but because it was a Harry Cohen film he insisted that Rita Hayworth would be the leading lady as Rita was under contract with Columbia Pictures. Orson Welles also told Peter that the final scene in the Hall of Mirrors was supposed to be completely silent, apart from the crashing of the mirrors with the gun shootout, but Harry Cohen insisted that the theme music had to be heard in the background and also throughout the film, which really annoyed Orson Welles and also comments about the first scenes in Central Park and felt that it was his worst acting scenes and was totally embarrassed when viewed at the films preview. Orson informed Peter about the very long memo sent to Harry Cohen that he did not want the continuous theme music played throughout the film and what specific sounds he wanted to be heard in the film and of course Harry Cohen completely ignored Orson Welles instructions. At a certain point of the film Peter talks about certain scenes in the film where the actors are in hammocks, where Peter feels this is a very chilling part in the film where they talk about sharks, which relates to evil people, and feels it is one of the best scenes in the film. By the way if you listen to this audio commentary, listen out for the most hilarious anecdote about Harry Cohen on previewing a film with Fritz Lang and informs him that the film is 16 minutes too long and Fritz Lang asks Harry Cohen how does he know this and what you hear will make you laugh out loud. We find out that the film composer Bernard Herrmann was first used by Orson Welles long before Alfred Hitchcock used him, especially in his Mercury Radio programmes and especially on two of Orson Welles famous films, and Orson wished he had been able to use Bernard Herrmann on the film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. Peter talks about the meeting he had with Orson Welles and how he influenced Peter in directing films and was also a great privilege to meet the great and awe inspiring director/actor Orson Welles. Also at the time of the meeting of Orson Welles there was quite an age gap, where Peter was 20 year of age and Orson was 50 years of age, but despite this Peter always felt that Orson had a very young outlook, but unfortunately health wise Orson Welles was not in the best of health and sadly at the age of 70 he passed away, and at the time of the meeting Orson predicted that when he is dead people will start to appreciate him so much more and of course his prediction has come to fruition, especially as a director of some of the most famous films ever released, especially in America from 1985 onwards. Peter also talks about the two directors that Orson Welles really admired and they were Jean Renoir and John Ford, and Orson especially loved the author P.J. Wodehouse and read to Peter some passages out of one of one his favourite books. When we get to the sequence in the Hall of Mirrors it is here that Peter points out the different framed apertures and we find out why Orson decided to have this part of the film in these different aspect ratios, and Peter was also very curious how Orson was able to film the actors in the mirrors without the camera not being viewed in the film. As we come to the end of the film, Peter comments that he feels Orson Welles is a towering genius and one that has inspired other people to go out there and make films also. So ends a really fascinating audio commentary, especially hearing so many interesting anecdotes about Orson Welles and there was sadly a lot more information from Peter that he revealed information on Orson Welles that I was not able include in this write up. I also found Peter Bogdanovich a really interesting person to listen to especially talking about his favourite and genius director Orson Welles who is up there as one of his best and true personal friend and if you want to find out totally fascinating information about the true genius that is Orson Welles, then this audio commentary will reveal all you want to know about this totally fascinating person Orson Welles, who I would of loved to have met and I can definitely assure you that this audio commentary definitely gets my five star rating and definitely not one to miss.

Special Feature: Simon Callow on THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI [2017] [1080] [1.78:1] [21:20] Here we have a brand new filmed appreciation piece by the acclaimed actor and Orson Welles scholar Simon Callow, who is totally passionate about the director and we hear some totally fascinating insight into all aspects about the director and his film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. We are informed by Simon Callow that at the time of Orson Welles personal film in 1947, he was going through a very rough patch in his overall career, but at the same time a previous director pulled out of directing the film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, so Orson Welles was brought in to rescue the project. At one point Orson felt he would like to try is hand into making a stage musical in collaboration with Cole Porter on Around The World In 80 days, but it all ended up in a total disaster, and it was an almighty flop and Orson owed vast amounts of money to the IRS. But out of the blue Harry Cohen of Columbia Pictures invited Orson Welles to direct the 1947 film, especially as it starred Rita Hayworth of the main leading lady, and the film was taken from the pulp fiction novel entitled If I Die Before I Wake by Sherwood King. Because Orson Welles wanted to film in certain locations it made Orson Welles and the crew very ill, all because of lots of logistic problems, but on top of all that the other woes for Orson Welles and the money problems were caused by the interference of the executives in not allowing Orson Welles to make the film how he had envisaged, but despite this, the end of the film in the Hall of Mirrors and that is definitely why Orson Welles is classed as a genius in pulling off such a dramatic end to the film. Simon Callow also points out that in his opinion Orson Welles is a total genius, but was always outwitted by much less intelligent people, and the director Mike Nichols also commented about the genius of Orson Welles, that the people who run the film studios are dumb. But as we come to the this very special feature, Simon Callow sums up that when you are a genius like Orson Welles, that at times he also felt like a genius, but when working in films you need people around you to support you, but unfortunately Orson Welles was a bit of a rebel and a loner who felt he did not need any help and all in all, in reality the studio executives were all in the end totally against Orson with his handling of the film, which unfortunately was his big downfall, which is a crying shame, as if he had been give 100% control, as well being given 100% support by the studio executives, I am sure Orson Welles would of produced another masterpiece as he envisaged, like the majority of his films that if Orson Welles had not had any interference by the studio executives would of produced even more true film masterpieces. Now despite this Simon Callow special is rather short, it certainly packs in a lot of information and is definitely well worth viewing and definitely gets a five star rating.

Special Feature: An Interview with Rita Hayworth [1970] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:01] Here we have a very rare archival black-and-white interview with the actress Rita Hayworth for the French TV programme entitled Pour le cin&eacute;ma. In this 1970 interview, the actress Rita Hayworth, who looks really good for her age, talks about her involvement with the French film The Road to Salina [1970] (French: La Route de Salina) and (Italian: Quando il sole scotta) and  amazingly Rita Hayworth speaks sometimes in French and also talks about her collaboration with Orson Welles in the film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and also informs us how the actress really enjoyed working on that film and was also encourage to do some directing of Orson Welles and told him off for over acting in a particular scene. Despite being such a very short interview, it was really interesting to watch. Unfortunately there is no English Subtitles, only French Subtitles, and also I had to really crank the sound up. This interview was originally broadcast on the 5th April, 1970 and produced by the Official National de Radiodiffusion T&eacute;l&eacute;vision Franaise 1972. Material supplied by INA [institut national de l'audiovisuel].

Special Feature: A Discussion with Peter Bogdanovich [2000] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:00] Here we have the renowned filmmaker and author talks about Orson Welles and his film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. This is a highly entertaining interview that has director Peter Bogdanovich sitting down to discuss Orson Welles cult film classic THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, which he describes the film as a hell of a picture and also with this interview we get loads of clips from the 1947 film, as well as Peter extolling the virtue of Orson Welles and how he feels he is a genius. Peter Bogdanovich was a close personal friend of Orson Welles so he is certainly one of the top people to discuss the legends work. The director shares all sorts of stories dealing with the history of the film including how it wasn't even on Orson Welles radar until his Broadway play of Around the World in 80 Days which was a total flop and also ran out of money and on top of all that Orson ran up massive amount of debts in the process and in the end studio executives tried to thwart Orson Welles career, as they thought he was an upstart, but along came Sam Spiegel in 1945 and helped to broker a deal to get Orson of a Black List and hired him to direct the film The Stranger, which to everyones surprise was a massive box office hit. But out of the blue Harry Cohn contacted Orson Welles and offered up this film for $50,000 to direct the film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. The production was full of problems including Orson Welles not wanting his then wife Rita Hayworth to be in the film and then her sickness pushed the film back for a month. Peter Bogdanovich also goes through all of the main actors and how they got their parts and especially the actor Everett Sloane who plays Arthur Bannister, who originally was one of the Mercury Players Theatre that was an independent repertory theatre company founded in New York City and Peter asked Orson Welles why was this lawyer had to be a cripple, and Orson felt that because Everett Sloane was a radio actor and did not move very well and he thought it would give the actor a much more interesting physical character. But unfortunately the film itself was totally jinxed, as a couple of the crew members died, lots of people got sick and especially Rita Hayworth, so again unfortunately Orson Welles got behind with the schedule, especially having to shut down production for one month. Peter talks about the scenes in the Hall of Mirrors and the symbolism it represented, which speaks for itself, in that it was very dynamic visually in especially being a totally theatrical thriller visual experience. But Peter also talks about the original cut of the film that was nearly 2 hours 30 minutes long and of course we are only able to view the shortened version that the studio executives totally ruined, which had roughly 60 minutes edited out, which really devastated Orson Welles, because the studio heads brought in a female film editor to edit the film that the studio executives approved of, because at the original longer film preview, the audiences did not like the film one bit. In America, the film got very bad reviews, also at the time no one wanted to talk to Orson Welles about the film, but there was one person in America who was a massive fan of the film and he was Truman Capote [Novelist] who could recite great swaths from the film line by line, but it was here in Europe that the film was a massive box office and cult success, and especially all of the other Orson Welles films. People always asked Orson why he would shoot certain scenes his way, and Orson would always reply that is the way he envisage a scene and also felt it was a much better way to shoot a scene, and Peter felt Orson was ahead of his time, but it also meant that he would always be in trouble, which blighted most of his career. So ends another interesting insight into the life and times of the genius that was Orson Welles and his constant battle he had with his 1947 film. Finally, the director talks about the various post-production problems including a couple of disastrous previews where the studio finally edited an hour out of the film and not following Orson Welles instructions. The director admits that we'll never know how great (or bad) the original version was but he talks about what he feels does work here. Best of all is that he can share a few stories that Orson Welles told him about the film and it's quite clear that he wasn't too thrilled with the end result. Fans of Orson Welles will certainly want to watch the film, especially after watching this interview with Peter Bogdanovich and even more so with the great informative stories and Peter Bogdanovich also gives you a few new thoughts about some of the material towards the film. But to sum up this Peter Bogdnaovich special feature, it was a really interesting to hear the directors views on this film and especially on Orson Welles and well worth viewing.

Special Feature: Joe Dante Trailer Commentary [2013] [480i] [1.78:1 / 1.33:1] [2:27] Here we have a short critical appreciation of the classic film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. Here also we are introduced to the director Joe Dante and does an audio commentary over the Theatrical Trailer being shown and also talks about the history of behind why Orson Welles wanted to make this film and the intrigue behind-the-scenes of the studio executives trying to frustrate Orson Welles in making this film. But as we come to this audio commentary, Joe Dante hopes that one day hopefully the original negative that ended up on the cutting room floor will be found, but also realises we will never be so lucky to find the missing scenes.

Theatrical Trailer [1947] [1080p] [1.37:1] [1:50] Here we have the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and is certainly a good presentation.

Special Feature: Image Gallery [2017] [1080p] Here we get to view extensive on-set and Original Promotional Material images. To view all 60 stunning spectacular black-and-white and colour images, you have to press the right hand skip function button on your remote control.

BONUS: Limited edition exclusive printed 40 page booklet with a new essay entitled A BRIGHT, GUILTY WORLD: MAGIC AND MADNESS IN THE LADY FROM SHAGHAI by critic Samm Deighan who is the Associate Editor of the online DiaboliqueMagazine and also hosts the Daughters of Darkness podcast. Samm Deighan is also the editor of Satanic Pandemonium, and has contributed to Fangoria, Paracinema, and Satanic Panic: Pop-Cultural Paranoia in the 1980s, among others, and Samm Deighan is currently writing a book on World War II and all aspect of the cult cinema. It also has an article entitled MUTINY ON THE ZACA by William Castles memoir entitled STEP RIGHT UP! . . . IM GONNA SCARE THE PANTS OFF AMERICA about the details of his involvement in making of the film THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI as an associate producer. We also get included a nine-page memo from 1947, presented here in full, detailing Orson Welles unhappiness with changes made to his initial, temporary score to Harry Cohn. We also get an article entitled ABOUT THE RESTORATION about the in-depth use of the SONY 2012 4K restoration of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI film as its source and the people involved with the process that includes comments by Grover Crisp, David Bernstein and Larry Chernoff. Finally, as an added bonus we get to some wonderful black-and-white images from the film.

Finally, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is true film genre classic, but like so many of Orson Welles films, that current evaluation doesnt save it from the studio executives tampering with the film at the time, especially where Columbia Picture executives butchered the picture from 155 minutes to its current 87 minutes and ignored nearly all of Orson Welles editorial suggestions. Still despite not being allowed to see the amazing longer version, especially on par like his other film projects like The Magnificent Ambersons [1942], Othello [1952], or Touch of Evil [1958], is how much brilliance manages to shine through, despite the annoying artistic interference, budgetary constraints, or the comparably immaterial box office failure. There is, and still is, no question about the genius of auteur Orson Welles. The film is sometimes very difficult to understand and sometimes very perplexing, whereas the longer version would have revealed the true genius of Orson Welles masterful directorial touches, still despite the shorter length film, sure makes it well worth the effort, but hopefully in time the negatives of the longer film version will finally be released. Highly Recommended!

449159,5,6302281849,"It's no surprise that ""Citizen Kane"" is Orson Welles' masterpiece. Now meet another, albeit lesser-known from the boy wonder, the wunderkind whose egos was just as gigantic as his talent. It was this conflict of narcissism and talent that would prove to be his undoing, producing numerous incomplete projects, baseless frictions within the studio system and his depressing (but inevitable) exile in Europe, but it also led to some of the most fascinating and rewarding movies ever made. One of those movies was ""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1947), the gripping film noir classic that gained as much attention for its stunning visuals as it did for Rita Hayworth's shocking new hair, courtesy of Welles.

It's irrelevant to talk about the story: Orson Welles plays Michael, the ""innocent"" but actually ""stupid"" sap who finds himself in a deadly web of murder, mystery and deceit, involving disabled man Arthur Bannister (played by Everett Sloane in his greatest performance), his wife (or ""lover"") Elsa (Rita Hayworth) and their bodyguard George (a deliciously hammy Glenn Anders). The seemingly simple plot is just an excuse for Welles to showcase his playful use of inventive camerawork, startling shadows, labyrinthine plot twists and striking set pieces, all culminating in the unforgettable shootout at a mirror hall, an appropriate place for a final showdown in a movie filled with double crosses, facade alliances and confused (and confusing) motivations. For many fans, it doesn't get more film noir than this; ""Shanghai"" was so deceptive in its tone and storytelling that it was greatly rumored that Harry Cohn offered a ransom on anyone who could explain the plot. But this is no infuriating art flick; it is a constantly engaging, mesmerizing thriller that rewards you upon multiple viewings.

Now onto the Blu-Ray. When one talks about Blu-Ray, three words are guaranteed to insert disdain into the hearts of movie fans: Mill Creek Entertainment. When it was announced that Mill Creek would distribute ""Lady from Shanghai"", there were grave concerns from the film community due to the company's dubious reputation of delivering hackneyed presentations of movies (particularly sets that include multiple films in one disc), especially when TCM had delivered a Blu-Ray disc of their own that actually included supplements. And indeed, putting on the Blu-Ray and watching its bare-bones menu (there are only the ""play movie"" and subtitles options; there are no supplements, not even a chapter selection) made me fear the worst.

But such fears proved unfounded. If there's one word to describe Mill Creek's Blu-Ray presentation of ""the Lady from Shanghai"", it is STUNNING. The print is pristine (there are no scratches, artifacts or technical flaws), the grain is intact, details are more noticeable than before and the brightness is well balanced.. For all its virtues, there were complaints that the TCM transfer had an overabundance of darkness. Despite using that same transfer, however, the brightness here is more accurate and presentable, finally giving Charles Lawson's cinematography the clarity missing from previous versions. The audio track itself is also very good and solid.

Best of all, it costs under $10, which is a good deal especially since most Orson Welles movies (even ones without supplements and with gravely inferior picture and audio qualities) cost $15 and sometimes even triple the price.

Despite the prevalent lack of bonus features, if you want to watch ""the Lady from Shanghai"" in the best possible presentation yet, you can't go wrong with the Mill Creek version, especially with great picture quality and a nice price tag to go with it. If you have a Blu-Ray and you've never seen ""Shanghai"" before, don't hesitate to buy.",1427414400,15,3761,5.230514096185738

Orson Welles sensational film noir THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (87 mins., 1947) has already been released on Blu-Ray through Turner Classic Movies website as a TCM Vault Collection exclusive  yet that release was marred by two distinct issues. The first problem came with TCMs initial pressing, where the VC-1 transfer suffered from a low-bit rate and lossy audio. TCM eventually corrected the problem by pressing a second, different version of the disc, this time with a more detailed, higher-bit rate AVC encode and Dolby TrueHD lossless audio  but with a different and even larger shortcoming. This time, the transfer was too dark, obscuring what should have been plainly visible details in the image.

The good news is that Mill Creek has come to the rescue and issued their own Blu-Ray, sourced from the same 4K Sony restoration that TCMs second pressing originated from  but with corrected brightness levels. Now, details that shouldve been in clear view in that TCM release are visible yet again, while the crisp B&W cinematography of Charles Lawson is highly detailed with a natural grain structure intact. Extras aren't included (the TCM release sported a Peter Bogdanovich commentary and a few other supplements), but for under $10 in most outlets, this is an easy recommendation for an essential genre film.",1426118400,15,1357,5.15

Orson Welles did a great job delivering both as Director and Actor ESPECIALLY blending talents in this movie of passion, theatrically romantic, a spot of pure charisma, jealousies and murderous plots that blew your mind away especially the house of mirrors scene.

449244,4,6302281849,"(Original February 23, 2014 review) Assuming you're here to hear about the Blu Ray/DVD combo released by the TCM Vault Collection, I'll keep a review of the actual film brief.

I don't love The Lady From Shanghai. I don't hate it either. It is more or less a movie I admire for its direction and visual style than for its ability to connect with an audience. Considering how hard it is for one to relate to an idiot in a movie and how non-idiotic many of us have known Orson Welles to have been, it is very hard to follow his idiotic Irish rogue as he makes blatant mistake after blatant mistake and somehow never comes to the realization that he's getting used by pretty much everyone he comes across, despite obvious manipulations on the parts of the antagonists. With that in mind, though, The Lady From Shanghai remains one hell of a treat for the eyes, featuring some of the most iconic Noir cinematography of the entire classic Noir period (1940-1958) and of Cinema as a whole. I'd recommend seeing it to anyone, given how many different people form many different opinions on it, most especially if you are a fan of Orson Welles the director (I for one really love Touch of Evil and The Trial).

That said, onto the Blu Ray release. Well, contrary to the (at the time of this posting) only other review of the film on here, I thought the movie looked absolutely fantastic. It appears to have been given a proper restoration (reportedly from a 4K scan), as Blacks are deep, Whites don't flare, Gray's are diverse and well modulated, Close ups fare well, and it doesn't have that waxy look of too much Digital Noise Reduction (DNR). It's sharp and retains just the right amount of grain for a film of this vintage. The Audio sounded just okay, not as good as, say, a Criterion release, but not awful either. I wish the special features were more comprehensive, but they suffice.

My one gripe with this edition is over whether or not it was more financially viable to release the Blu Ray like this. As I said above, the film is an iconic representation of Film Noir, so all this quiet, limited edition release does is screw with the many fans of the film, particularly given its lackluster Special Features. I didn't even know the film had been released on Blu Ray until I saw some late reviews for its release, by which point the film already jumped up to nearly $30 when I bought it. Now, it is out of print and hovering around $45+, which I expect will be a price that'll only rise over time. With all the money they poured into giving it a 4K scan and release, you'd think it'd be smarter on Sony's part to have given it a release the size of say, Kino Lorber or Criterion. Sadly, this is not the case.

However, if you (can afford to) get the film in this edition, I can't say you'd be really displeased. I'm not, and for what it's worth, I think it is a fine addition to my growing Home Video collection of Blu Rays.

(January 15, 2015) EDIT: Things have changed a bit since I typed up this review around a year ago. Through the Turner Classic Movies Shop on their website, the Blu Ray/DVD combo of the film can now be purchased at a set price of around $25, and in March, there will be a single disc Blu Ray release from Mill Creek. Great news. Maybe the price'll come down here on Amazon, maybe it won't, so I'd recommend considering all your options before making a purchase.

However, as Carcosa mentioned in the comments accompanying this review, the version of The Lady From Shanghai for sale on TCM's website is one with a different transfer than the one I reviewed here. The way to tell the difference between editions with the new transfer and the old is that the old transfer has its discs in a DVD case whereas the new transfer has them in a Blu Ray case. I can't personally tell you if the new version is a better transfer or not as I haven't seen it. From what I've read, the reactions to it are largely mixed in a comparison to the older one. Some reviews have stated that they consider it better than this one, apparently because of a higher bitrate and an associated lack of compression issues, whereas others have said it doesn't look as good because of the image is apparently darker to the point of making some things hard to see. Either way, it is apparently still a pretty solid transfer as far as video goes. I haven't heard anything about differences in audio quality or of more special features on the new release and there isn't much information on whether the upcoming March 2015 single-disc release uses the new transfer or the old or a different transfer (although it'll most likely be the newer one).

Regardless of whether one video transfer is better, with this classic film seeing something other than a limited edition release, I can say with a certainty that on the whole these new developments are mostly a good thing.",1393113600,64,4864,4.464566929133858

449296,5,6302281849,"This movie was not well received in America (nobody should be the director, producer and main actor in the picture some complained) until many years later though the Europeans loved it. Tale centers around a romantic Irish bloke (Orson Welles) who meets a pretty blonde (Rita Hayworth with a new look for the movie)  in NYC, flirts with her, finds out she's married to a powerful man (played by Everett Sloane) and then takes a job from that wealthy man strangely drawn to said blonde. All along the mentally troubled blonde (who draws parallels to Hayworth in real life) continues to flirt with him and promise that there will be more than flirting further down the road. So he goes along with it and serves as a hand on the yacht of said powerful man and they traverse part of the globe going through the Panama Canal to San Francisco. But, as this is a film noir things are not always what they seem and our Irish laddie boy is in for a surprise.

Glenn Anders was picked out to play an edgy creepy sort of character (George Grisby) who kept worrying about the bomb being dropped on his head. There is a precipitous feel to some of the scenes and ominous backgrounds are common as are the themes of the false promise of escape (compare the opening scene with the mugging in Central Park for starters) and humans preying on one another physically, sexually and mentally. The surreal finale in the Hall of Mirrors has become popular with critics as the years have passed. Interestingly enough, the finale was supposed to be some 20 minutes but was edited down to three minutes by Welles' boss. An hour of the entire film was cut out and no one has been able to find it. Welles felt the musical score was too obvious and therefore lacking in the subtlety he desired but his power was limited as he had recently been released from the unspoken blacklist. Rita did this picture to bring herself closer to her husband (Orson Welles) but they ended up divorcing before the film was even released. Years later on his death bed Welles would claim Hayworth was the love of his life and some say the last line in the film was Welles' adieu to Hayworth. Sloane didn't have the right walk for a big time trail attorney (most of his experience was as a radio actor) so he was made into a walking cripple. The yacht belonged to Errol Flynn and in one shot said actor can be seen in the background around the cantina in Acapulco. Welles hated attorneys and the court scene has a satirical setup which drew some complaints.

Based on a novel IF I DIE BEFORE I AWAKE by Sherwood King. It cost about $2M to make but made a bit under $1.5M at the Box Office and probably partly as a result Welles left the country to make movies elsewhere and it wasn't until eleven years later that he came back to make films in American again. That film was TOUCH OF EVIL which suffered through heavy editing and second billing much to the irritation of Welles.

George Grisby: You just killed him for the fun of it, eh? Michael O'Hara: He was a Franco spy. There was a war on at the time. George Grisby: Then it wasn't murder, I suppose. Tell me, would you do it again? Would you mind killing another man? Michael O'Hara: I'd kill another Franco spy.
George Grisby: I was on a pro-Franco committee during the Spanish War. Would you kill me if I gave you the chance?... I may give you the chance.  /// Bannister: Take Bessie here.

449297,2,6302281849,"I didn't know anything about THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. It was the title and the cast that caught my attention. I'm a fan of film noir. I also know Orson Welles is considered a genious and Rita Hayworth was one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the big screen. Welles and Hayworth were married at the time so I wondered what chemistry they would have on screen.
I know there were several possible titles for the film, and THe LADY FROM SHANGHAI was not the best choice. Although Rita Hayworth's character Elsa Bannister had lived in Shanghai in the past, it really had no connection to the story. Beautiful Rita Hayworth is not even recognizable with her short blond hair. I kept thinking I was watching Lana Turner.
Film noir is a specific genre where there is never a heartwarming story about decent people working out misunderstandings and finding happiness in the end. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI took theri dark story even further. Everyone in this film is suspect. Everyone also seems to be beyond redemption. Rita Hayworth lights up the screen with her beauty but her new looks also give her a more severe and unwelcoming look.
Orson Welles plays his Michael O'Hara with a think Irish accent. O'Hara has a violent past that includes wartime ""murder."" Elsa Bannister has a very seedy past that is never fully explained nor do we ever find out how she ended up married to letcherous Arthur Bannister. This wealthy lawyer has never lost a case. He is seriously handicapped so Elsa is as much his nurse as his wife. Enter George Grisby, played by Everett Sloane, as Bannister's slimey, sweaty law partner and you can imagine where this all heads.
Michael saves Elsa from muggers in Central Park and the next day, Arthur wants to hire Michael as a seaman on his yacht. Arthur, Elsa and George are planning a cruise to San Francisco via the Panama Canal.
Here is a bit of a deviation from the usual film noir story as there is a lot of filming on location in places like Acapulco and on the yacht. There are a lot of day time scenes.
George is an odd, eccentric and annoying character who is always covered in sweat. George offers to pay Michael to help George ""disappear"" by faking his own murder. No one can be trusted so it's hard to imagine Michael would fall for this scheme. The slow-moving film picks up speed ad the plot is hatched and nothing goes as planned.
THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is not a pleasant film to watch. It gets praise as a Welles masterpiece but I found it to be scattered. The backgrounds of the characters are never clear. All we know is that only disaster can come out of these people being thrown in together.",1330300800,5,2635,4.549473684210526

449320,2,6302281849,"""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1948) was directed by Orson Welles and stars Welles and his estranged wife, Rita Hayworth along with Everett Sloane. The film is based on a 1938 novel by Sherwood King called ""If I Die Before I Wake.""

There isn't much new that can be said about Welles. He created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time - ""Citizen Kane"" ( 1941). But somewhere along the line, early on, he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. By 1946, when this film was made, Welles was already in trouble and exhibiting many of the problems that would unhinge his career. Though his brilliance would always shine through even the shabbiest of projects he undertook, it became harder and harder to find.

Rita Hayworth appeared in more than 60 films. At first she stressed her Latin background and her skills as a dancer. After several forgettable films she made her mark in Howard Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939) and then went on to more acclaim in ""The Strawberry Blonde"" (1941) with Jimmy Cagney and ""Blood and Sand"" (1941) with Tyrone Power.  She was a major cover girl in WW2, married Welles in 1943, then married Prince Aly Kahn in 1949. She is best remembered for her role as ""Sadie Thompson"" (1953). Hayworth plays the wife of Everett Sloane. AFI rated her character as the 14th worst villain in film history.

Everett Sloane appeared in more than 100 films and TV programs and was part of the Orson Welles stock company. In fact his film debut was in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) as Mr. Bernstein and he appeared in several Welles films like ""Journey into Fear"" (1943) and ""Lady from Shanghai"" (1948). He transitioned to TV in the early 50s.

Sloane plays a disabled attorney. Variety said he ""gives a credible interpretation..."" which was one of the few positive comments Variety made.

The film also features Ted De Corsia, Erskine Sanford, and Gus Schilling.

- This was the film debut of Ted De Corsia who went on to play in more than 100 films and TV shows, often as a villain in films like ""Naked City"" (1948) and ""The Killing"" (1956).

- Erskine Sanford was a member of Welles' troupe and appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), ""The Stranger"" (1946), and ""Macbeth"" (1948). He plays the judge at Welles' trial.

- Gus Schilling appeared in 5 films with Welles (""Citizen Kane"", ""The Magnificent Ambersons"", ""Macbeth"" and ""Touch of Evil"") and was also a favorite of Nicholas Ray (e.g., ""On Dangerous Ground"", ""Rebel without a Cause""). He usually plays the comic relief, which was assisted by his background in burlesque. Gus plays Welles' friend.

""Lady"" is an early film noir, although at the time, film noir had not yet been identified as a genre. Film noir  includes plot elements such as double (and preferably triple) crosses, a femme fatale, a cast of sleazy albeit interesting characters, murder, and a doomed protagonist. Structural elements include low key lighting, unbalanced compositions, lots of rain and/or night shots. Film noir is usually B picture quality, but can feature A quality stars (e.g., Barbara Stanwyck in `Double Indemnity"", Lana Turner in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", Ava Gardner in ""The Killers""). ""Lady"" was not Welles' only film noir - ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and ""The Stranger"" (1946) are also considered film noir.

Harry Cohn, Columbia's President, remarked - ""I'll give $1000 to anyone who can explain it to me."" Variety said it was ""okay box office"" but ""entertainment suffered from the striving for effect that features Orson Welles' production, direction and scripting.""

Husband and wife, on and off screen, argued throughout the filming, and Hayworth became ill and the costs ran more than $500,000 over budget. Nonetheless, just before his death, Welles referred to her as ""one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived.""

The film opened to poor box office and critical comment. It was the last time Welles would make a Hollywood film for 10 years. The original ran 155 minutes but the studio cut it to 87.

Welles was interested in betrayal, especially male betrayal. We see this in ""Citizen Kane"" (Kane vs. Leland), in ""Macbeth"" (Macbeth vs. MacDuff), ""Othello"" (Iago vs. Othello), ""Touch of Evil"" (Quinlan vs. Menzies), etc. and we see it clearly here too.

The main problem with this film is the acting. It's terrible. Welles gives his worst performance ever, and his attempt at an Irish accent is laughable. At times he is incoherent, and at other times he sounds like Barry Fitzgerald, who was only slightly coherent. At other times he drops the accent all together. As if that weren't problem enough, Welles sleep walks through the film, and his scenes with Hayworth lack any chemistry at all. It's hard to believe they were lovers. They don't even seem interested in each other.

The terrible acting isn't helped by the cheap sets and the stock footage that is used so often as backdrop. Nor is the melodramatic music particularly helpful, when it is set against the awful acting.

Then there are the plot flaws. Welles has a clearly established alibi for where he was when Grisby is killed, and he has the $2K cash to prove his story. In addition, the note he signed is so absurd that it can't possibly be used against him in the trial. Then there's the escape, based on his having swallowed a few pills and his instant collapse. Just plain silly.

Then there's the army of Chinese who apparently are heavily involved in this all along. Where did that come from?

Then there's the court room scene in which Welles plays with the crowd in a way reminiscent of the chorus in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"". While it was brilliant in that film, it is annoying and out of place in a film noir.

Some critics will argue that the closing sequence in the mirrored hall of magic makes up for all the rest of the problems with the film. Perhaps. Supporters of Welles will argue that there are many bravura scenes - e.g.,  the opening, the cigarette ballet on the boat, the agreement made along the walls, the expressionistic camera work in the mad house - and this is very true. But there are also many poor compositions and the excess use of glamour shots of Hayworth surely don't belong in film noir. Welles fans will argue that the plot flaws are the fault of the studio cutting so much footage, but while that's probably true in some cases (e.g., the sudden omnipresence of Chinese conspirators) it's probably not true in others (e.g., Welles' alibi).

If anything, ""Lady from Shanghai"" shows us (once again) that in general Welles was a great artist, but a poor filmmaker. Sometimes his great artistry lasted long enough to encapsulated an entire film, but usually it didn't, leaving us with memorable bits and pieces, but an unsatisfying whole.",1273276800,7,7000,4.810158201498751
449321,4,6302281849,"Regardless of the fact that some of his films can be disjointed, confusing and aggravating (although, you can hand some of the blame to the studios for that), there is no denying that fact that Orson Welles was a genius and most likely the greatest director of all time.  `The Lady From Shanghai' suffers from it's lack of cohesion and a sense of aggravating confusion, but when all is said and done it is still a very compelling and rapturous film noir.

Feeling like a Hitchcock inspired take on a Tennessee Williams play, `The Lady From Shanghai' has enough going for it to balance out the inconsistencies working against it.

The film tells the story of an Irish sailor named Michael O'Hara who winds up seduced by a married woman named Elsa.  Elsa's husband Arthur is a lawyer, an oddly sinister one, who offers Michael a job manning his yacht.  Michael is suspicious, but he reluctantly takes the job.  Once on board he meets the obnoxious George, Arthur's business partner, and is offered an odd proposition.  George wants Michael to kill him, and in return he will make sure Michael receives $5,000.

Yes, as many have pointed out, the films plot (especially towards the end) gets jumbled and confusing and aggravating, but Welles has a powerful way of smoothing out our concerns.  We forgive the film's plot holes because Welles leaves us spellbound with his precise way of cutting each scene effortlessly.

We are never let off edge.

When sitting back to analyze the film, it becomes apparent that Welles was rooting out his own feelings of loneliness and self examination.  The cast of characters are obviously missing something pertinent to their happiness.  There is a scene where Michael encounters Arthur, George and Elsa simply tearing one another to shreds with hurtful words and it becomes apparent to Michael that they are masking something internal with their careless words.  The film carries a stunning tone, one of misery and abandonment, that helps to establish the films central focus.

Even though one may have trouble connecting the film's overall plot, one has no trouble finding the films moral heart.

The acting, for me, is hit and miss.  Both Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles are spectacular.  Hayworth is the epitome of seductive here, layering her character with enough internal longing and faux contentment to make her a soft and vulnerable seductress.  Welles understands his characters dark dimensions, and he plays to them effortlessly.  For me, Everett Sloane is a little too inconsistent.  Some scenes work in his favor, but others have him feeling a tad overdone.  I found Glenn Anders to be ridiculous and almost laughable at times.  It is easily the worst performance in the film, which is sad because his character has one of the biggest arcs and a steady performance would have aided in the films core.

In the end I give this a solid B, and I totally recommend it.  It is an engrossing noir that brings a lot to the table.  Sure, it is not Welles' best offering, and it may leave you scratching your head a bit in the end, but overall it is still worth your attention and your meditation.",1271030400,,3133,4.809345794392524
449322,5,6302281849,"The review of A. Guidici just a couple before mine serves as a sad encapsulation of all of the garbage and misrepresentations thrown at Orson Welles over the years before AND after his death. The scope of his life's work is only now beginning to truly sink in. To say he did nothing worthy after Kane is to dismiss not just this film but The Magnificent Ambersons, which could have been better than Kane if RKO had lived up to their agreement and allowed him to finish its editing, and later masterpieces like F For Fake and Chimes at Midnight- and everything in between. Poor or unfinished? Give me a break. All of his films are worthy of mention alongside Citizen Kane. Do yourselves a favor and don't settle for the usual lazy, middlebrow entertainment journalism. The true story of his career is still coming to the light of day; read Orson Welles at Work, Discovering Orson Welles, This Is Orson Welles, Orson Welles: The Stories of His Life and other more fair-minded material, rather than the vindictive -and sex-obsessed- writings of people like David Thomson. Nothing is worse than a 'biographer' complaining about a supposed lazy, undisciplined artist who gets more accomplished in a single day than they will in an entire lifetime. Most directors don't stay up all night painting their own sets, only to be harangued for a lack of focus or fear of completion! And btw Guidici complains that Lady from Shanghai loses comprehensibility of dialogue even tho the studio cut out an hour, as if losing an hour of material is going to CLEAR UP plot! This is exactly the wrongheaded thinking that prompted many studios to take Orson's films away from him and have someone else edit them in an effort to make things more logical. This always has the opposite effect, as anyone with the most rudimentary understanding of filmmaking knows. I can only be grateful to him for continuing and getting as many films completed as possible, no matter the odds. Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Stranger, Lady From Shanghai, MacBeth, Othello, Mr Arkadin, Touch of Evil, The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and F for Fake, among others...",1264032000,6,2135,4.820163487738419
449323,5,6302281849,"Orson Welles has done it again.  For $50,000 and a promise to Columbia to direct a book with a different title, he was able to save the costumes for his ""Around the World in 80 Days"" theater performance as well as give us another butchered masterpiece.  Being a relative ""newbie"" to Welles, one always argues that ""Citizen Kane"" remains his magnum opus, but after watching ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (a stronger, more genuine film) and now, ""The Lady from Shanghai"", the argument seems a bit too one-sided.  Welles is a powerful director, a decent actor, and a detailed storyteller; one doesn't need to argue that all day.  Yet, it is impressive that he is known only as a one-film man, when everything else watched has continued to get stronger and stronger.  ""Magnificent Ambersons"" proved that he could tackle the family drama as well as a social commentary on the wealthy, and with ""Shanghai"" he proves that he can transform a movie star from pin-up girl to sadistic lover.  Part noir, part travelogue, part confusion, ""Shanghai"" was an experience all within itself.  Harry Cohen, head of Columbia, has stated that if anyone could tell him what this film was about, he would pay $1000.  That speaks volumes about the ability that Welles had to construct an intelligent, gripping noir.  ""Shanghai"" is about love, it is about revenge, is about mirrors, and it is about the law - all brought together in a way only Orson Welles could do it.

Originally two and a half hours, the version viewed was under 90-minutes, meaning quite a bit of Welles vision was lost in the editing room.  One even hears stories that his original score was cut and replaced with cartoon music and constant repetition of the theme song.  It would be hard to imagine what Welles' original vision would have produced, but even with his missing elements - ""Shanghai"" proves thought-provoking, entertaining, and downright diabolical.  It begins with two actors, Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles, together in a park, learning that even the most beautiful women come with baggage and history.  From the very bizarre car park sequence, we soon get the impression that this isn't going to be your normal film.  Welles pulls you in with the unknown, and unique characters.  His portrayal of Michael O'Hara is possibly the weakest element to this film, as his accent fades in and out of existence with each scene.  Welles is good as an actor, but adding the Irish element to his voice diminished the ability to truly believe who he was meant to be.  On the other hand, Rita Hayworth was phenomenal.  Her transformation in this film could be likened to a modern day Theron's ""Monster"" or Swank's ""Boys Don't Cry"", shedding her long red hair for a short platinum look.  She was not only impressive physically, but as mysterious as noir women come.  From the opening scene, she is always someone she is not - and when Glenn Anders looks at her from his binoculars several scenes later - it is as if Welles is saying, we all need to be watching her.  Up until the final moments, we don't know where her loyalties remain, and that speaks value of both the director and the actor.

With Hayworth giving her best, Welles taking strides behind the camera (not quite in front of), the other one to watch is Everett Sloane, who plays the handicapped Arthur Bannister.  Welles gives Sloane this meaty character who drinks, worries, plans, and is the best lawyer in town - yet has this crippling physical attribute which creates this darker, more diabolical character.  Sloane was my favorite character in this film, because, like Hayworth, we were never quite sure what his next play was, or who he was doing this all for.  With ""Shanghai"" Welles has crafted this amazing noir that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, impressively shot, and delivers an ending that remains a cult favorite - attempted to be recreated time and time again, but always lacks that panache only Welles could film.

VIDEO:  The film was impressive.  It takes you from a park, to the open sea (look for Errol Flynn), to a native island, back to San Francisco.  The images are sharp to coincide with the power of Welles choice of actors and ability to carry a scene.  The only downfall, this was originally filmed (like most Welles) around 2+ hours, and the version I watched was under 90 minutes.  What did we miss?  How amazing could this film have been?

VISUAL:  Stunning black and white imagery.  Welles is not afraid to give us the long shot or the intense close up.  In hot places, everyone was sweating.  Was it due to the heat, or their knowledge of what was to come?
SOUND:  Gunshots were loud, the courtroom scene was intense, and the waves were present.  Even though his original score wasn't used, it worked.  With his stark visuals, the sound only collaborates with Welles.  He may not have liked it, but for this edited version, it worked.

EXTRAS:  Surprisingly, not bare boned.  There is an introduction by Peter Bogdanovich which gives us quite a bit of detail on this film, but he uses the same material again for his audio commentary.  I liked what Bogdanovich had to say, but when he just starts reading from his book instead of giving us insight on the scene, it gets a bit dull to hear.  The visuals and him rambling on saying ""he said, then I said"", just didn't pan out.  Good, but not great.  We wrap up with a couple of trailers and language options.  Overall, pretty well rounded.

This is a character driven film, and despite my flimsy nature on Welles the actor, the other background characters have enough heart to carry what he lacks.  The power of Hayworth, Sloane, and Anders alone is worth watching.  Who are these guys?  How did they choose O'Hara?  Why be so elaborate?  The twist and turns continue to come, and ""Shanghai"" has that repeatable feel that your DVD player will love.  I cannot wait to rewatch this film and see what was missed.  There had to be more clues, something in the background that the virgin eye would miss.  This was noir at, well, maybe its best looking, but well represented.

Thank you Mr. Welles for continuing to impress me with each passing film.

449324,3,6302281849,"I thought that a film starring Orson Wells and Rita Hayworth would have to be enjoyable.  The first half was good and from there on the plot got so convuluted that I couldn't follow it and eventually lost interest.  It's still interesting to see the great Orson Welles--he is a fascinating actor.  And Rita Hayworth was one of the most gorgeous and glamourous actresses of her time, if not all time.  Still one needs a little more to make a good film.  Many folks are so impressed by Welles' reputation that they are prepared to like anything he did.  And if you weren't sure, then there's an extra where Peter Bogdonavich tells you how great it was!

For me, it failed to hold my interest to the end.  If the plot had been cleaned up a bit, I might have stuck with it.

One interesting thing to me was that, although the Hayworth character was named ""Elsa"", the Welles' character preferrd to call her ""Rosalie.""  This reminded me of ""Rosebud"" in Citizen Kane. Perhpas Welles had some secret fondness/obsession with roses...?",1255737600,5,1025,4.613259668508287
449325,1,6302281849,"Far too many of Welles's later films are called masterpieces now. Back when I was a young MFA candidate, there were scores of articles written about how Welles had declined after Kane. Then he died. Suddenly all those wretched pictures became masterpieces.

The camera work in this film is striking at times. But as a story, this film is incomprehensible and impossible to follow. As is the case so often after Kane, Welles is so impressed with himself that he dazzles us with irrelevance; even after they cut almost an hour out of this, much of the dialogue is puzzling. It doesn't help the story. And the film is dramatically uneven: Loud and forceful must be balanced with soft and neutral or the entirety is just noise. This film, like almost all the post-Kane films, is mostly just pointless roaring. Welles's Irish brogue is equally unconvincing, but that isn't the worst thing in this film.

Welles's screen writing is almost always subpar. He was never capable of writing something that advanced from scene to scene logically and with the proper pacing. This film, like The Trial and Touch of Evil (ugh!) has long scenes with lots of bewildering dialogue that doesn't inform us or work to the advantage of the storytelling. His later movies fail largely due to this flaw: the storytelling is downright bad. (Citizen Kane disguises this shortcoming to some degree because the story is told in flashbacks).

Another reason Citizen Kane worked was because Welles was willing to work with other people and let them contribute. This film is a good example of how Welles tried to do everything, and he didn't do everything nearly well enough, and the film falls apart. Another big reason why Welles never made another good film after Kane is because he was a royal pain in the neck to work with. He was abusive, critical, overbearing, and generally just enormously difficult as well. It's a miracle he was hired so often as an actor, it really is.

We all - myself included - want Orson Welles to have been a great director. We want all of his later work to be as good as Kane. We want to think of him in later years as the jolly, bearded sage of American cinema. But we're deluding ourselves - the work badly fails, and he is found wanting. After Kane, Welles continually tried to get back to who he once was, and couldn't. He eventually alienated so many people that he became a carnival sideshow, doing all manner of tawdry commercials he could do to finance his later films. All of which, regrettably, are either poor or unfinished.

Good Art has to work; it has to hold together, and has to accomplish what it attempts. Welles's later work does none of that - it fails miserably. Watching The Trial and Touch of Evil and this film and calling them good pictures is the equivalent of contemplating your navel I'm afraid... As one film professor said to me once, Welles's later films are ""all over the place.""

Welles was bold, had courage, was a maverick, and believed to his death that he put forth a unique and skillful vision. But all that isn't enough, the art still has to work. You can have all those qualities and never again make another picture worth a damn.",1253232000,17,3173,4.647058823529412
449326,4,6302281849,"""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1948) flaunts its cinematic iconoclasm from beginning to end. Defying Hollywood tradition, director-star Orson Welles creates a nightmarish charade. Since Orson's Irish sailor remains as unconvincing as Rita Hayworth's femme fatale, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" can be viewed as a distorted, fun-house parody of classic film noir. Modern-day critics who bemoan the  confused plotting and bizarre motivations never acknowledge the stream-of-consciousness framework established by Welles' tongue-in-cheek narration. There is a method to this chaos. Marked by abrupt shifts in tone and locale, the film becomes a never-ending series of jolts  culminating in the legendary ""hall of mirrors"" shootout. Despite studio interference, the wildly uneven ""Lady from Shanghai"" is delirious Wellesian bravura with an undercurrent of paranoia and despair.",1247356800,2,863,6.065573770491803

449328,3,6302281849,"I am always looking for a good San Francisco story (I watch and review San Francisco detective/noir movies), so was curious about The Lady from Shanghai. Yes, it has beautiful views of post-WWII San Francisco and even better views of Rita Hayworth, but the story itself is unsatisfying, maybe because so much of it ended up on the cutting-room floor but also perhaps because it's hard to understand the how the protagonist, Michael O'Hara, could be such a moron. Rita Hayworth could probably convince most straight men to do crazy things, but to agree to help someone fake his own death? When the alleged purpose of this fakery is so that the dead guy can collect his own life insurance? Shouldn't even the most hormone-distracted guy have seen that there might be more to this story and smelled a rat?

Still, the setup of a shark tank of nefarious characters is excellent. The unfaithful wife, the rich and brilliant but also old and crippled husband, and the resentful but dependent business partner are all beautifully drawn and sharply observed. Secrecy and duplicity are built into the characters, which serves the atmosphere of the film very well. All of this, however, raises expectations for some sort of clever dnouement (a fancy way of saying ""tying up the loose ends and providing a satisfactory resolution"") that just does not happen. Were this movie being made today, one might suspect that The Lady from Shanghai: The Sequel was being readied for a 2010 Memorial Day weekend release.",1229385600,3,1498,4.897637795275591
449349,4,6302281849,"A bit of a different take: Could the vindictiveness between Welles and Studio head Harry Cohn have ultimately saved this film and turned it into a out-of-sync classic?
It truly is a bizarre film.  Both in the script/dialogue and in the strange outdoor/indoor filming--all combined in the same moments of the film.  Cutaways that seem oddly out of place et cetera.
Cohn may have turned this twisted noir of a movie inadvertently into a classic.  Uncut, it may have been one big bore fest with Welles obsessing over Hayworth.  The plot, what there is of one, is opaque to the point of invisibility; only rapping things up at the end, and you accepting the rap up.
One has to wonder what the two versions would have been like if the cut footage had been saved and restored.  Unfortunately, unless some camera man has that missing footage in a sealed container in his garage, we shall never know.
In the end, I think this horribly bizarre classic has gone down as another Wellesian visionary classic.  He may have Cohn, and his malice towards Welles, to thank for saving what may have been ""The My Marriage To Rita Story"".
Only one regret: I wish they had saved the entire ending in the funhouse.  Welles worked personally on the sets--painstakingly painting them by hand; and even cut, the funhouse sequence is a piece of film brilliance.  It leaves you wanting the whole vision.  But then again: it leaves you wanting more; so maybe Cohn did Welles an unwitting favour even in this.
But still . . .
You have to be an Orson Welles viewer to enjoy this out of kilter, queerly shot film.
The funhouse ending sequence is without a doubt a statement of the whole film and how it ended up: Shards on the floor with bodies strewn all over the place with their gasping words trying to clue you in as to what you just watched! :)
If not an aficianado of Welles strange career in cinema, just pass.  You shall find it somewhat tedious.

449350,4,6302281849,"Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles, with a very soft Irish brogue), an out of work seaman, has a brief encounter in Central Park with Elsa `Rosalie' Bannister (Rita Hayworth, with short blonde hair!).  Later that evening they meet again when O'Hara rescues her from a mugging in progress.  In gratitude, her crippled husband, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) seeks out O'Hara and offers him a job as a crew member on their luxury yacht  on a voyage from New York to their home in San Francisco.  Against his better judgment, O'Hara allows himself to be talked into taking the job.  Also against his better judgment, he finds he cannot resist Rosalie's advances.

When the yacht stops in the West Indies to take on supplies, the party is joined by Bannister's law partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders).  Grisby and Bannister prove to be a garrulous and very creepy pair.  Their exaggerated and unattractive mannerisms as well as their choice of conversational topics are, to say the least, unwholesome.  Bannister hints there is something in Rosalie's past that enabled him to blackmail her into marriage.  He also implies that he doesn't mind if his beautiful wife is having an affair with O'Hara because he can satisfy her in ways that Bannister cannot.  Bannister is twisted in mind as well as body.

On a layover in Acapulco, Grisby approaches O'Hara with an offer of $5000 to kill him.  At first Michael thinks he is planning to commit suicide.  He talks it over with Rosalie and they conclude that Grisby is just insane.  When the yacht finally reaches its destination, Michael asks Rosalie to run away with him.  She is reluctant to do so because she doesn't want a life of hardship and poverty.  Michael tells her that $5000 will give them a good start in their new life and goes off to find Grisby.

Grisby doesn't really want Michael to kill him.  He wants to fake his own death so he can collect on insurance and live the good life on some tropical island.  In order to prove to the insurance company that he is dead, he needs a signed confession from Michael that he accidentally shot Grisby and dumped the body in the bay.  Without an actual body, Michael can't be convicted.  It's a win / win.  Unfortunately, something goes dreadfully wrong.  Michael arrives at Grisby's office, with a smoking gun in his hand and a signed confession in his pocket, just as Grisby's corpse is being wheeled out on a stretcher.  Will Michael be convicted of the crime?  Will he be able to discover the real killer?  What will happen between Michael, Rosalie and Bannister?  From here out, the pace of the film becomes a roller coaster of suspense and action.  Welles planned an elaborate tour de force chase and confrontation scene in an amusement park fun house, but the studio cut and destroyed most of the footage.  What remains is a very famous scene involving a shootout in a hall of mirrors.

The studio hack job makes it very difficult follow the plot and almost impossible to understand the particulars of how the insurance scam is actually supposed to work.  There still exists a nine page memo from Welles to studio head, Harry Cohen, describing how the film should be scored; the film as it exists today follows none of the guidelines.  Sequences that Welles wanted to cut out entirely were revamped during the studio's editing process.  The genius of Orson Welles was such that even with massive studio interference in rewrite, editing and music, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" can still be considered one of the great films noir.

The DVD has a very nicely cleaned up black and white film quality.  The audio is clear and sharp, though Welles' Irish accent can be a bit soft and inaudible at times.  Soundtracks are available in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai.  The special features include an optional commentary track by Peter Bogdanovich, in which he quotes from many conversations he had with Welles about this movie; a featurette ""Conversation with Peter Bogdanovich"";  printed biography and filmography `talent files' for Welles and Hayworth; vintage advertising and original theatrical trailers for ""The Lady from Shanghai"" and several other classic films.

449351,4,6302281849,"Recently I reviewed Rita Hayworth's classic femme fatale performance in Gilda in this space after some delay from the time of watching, on doctor's advice, until such time as my blood pressure when down enough to safety do the film justice. At the end of that review I nevertheless had to cut it short because I could definitely feel that old pressure rising again. But I am okay now and can review a later Hayworth femme fatale effort, The Lady From Shanghia. Old Rita still has them (and me) jumping through hoops but I am not worrying about my blood pressure on this one.

Let me repeat some of that previous Gilda review to make sure that we are all on the same page here:

""....But enough of introductory justification, let us get to the heart of the matter- a film review of 1940s ""hot"" (you can see where I am going with this already) film star Rita Hayworth in her most famous film, the film noir classic, Gilda, and the men, the legions of men in the film and in the audience, including this writer, whom she had (or could have had in my case) jumping through hoops (and much more).

Now the last time that devilishly sweet-smiling, buttery-voiced, long-legged, big-haired, been around the block and is still standing, femme fatale Rita's name came up for this writer was when her photograph, just her big blow-up photo nothing more, was used to cover (literally) actor Tim Robbins' escape route in the film, The Shawshank Redemption. Of course, that flash got me to thinking about the film Gilda and there you have it. So naturally I had to see the thing, again. I have had to wait until now though to write this little commentary until my doctor said that I my blood pressure went down a little.""

And seeing Gilda of course let to this review.  Know that the points made in the quoted  commentary still stands here, except that she, Rita that is, is a blonde femme fatale this time. And not all femme fatales are born equal. Some like Gilda are capable of good and some like the lady from Shanghai here are not.

Here are the high points of the plot quickly. Down and out seaman ""Black Irish"" O' Hara (Orson Welles) hits New York looking for... something. And he finds it without much trouble, although in the end it will be nothing but trouble. Enter Elsa (Rita Hayworth) who just happens to be slumming on a horse and buggy ride in Central Park and who, as fate would have it, a not uncommon fate at least in Central Park, is waylaid by some hooligans. Black Irish comes to the rescue and is immediately smitten. Black Irish, please, please she is poison, even I can tell that. But, no, old Blackie is bound and determined to pursue this deadly course, also a not uncommon occurrence when one is smitten.

Of course problem number one is that said Elsa is married, married to a great criminal lawyer, Arthur Bannister (played by  Everett Sloane)  with some serious physical disabilities and a perverse mental make-up that has old Elsa fed up. Problem number two is that Elsa and said hubby are going on a long sea voyage via the Panama Canal to their home port `Frisco on their yacht. Hey, Blackie, you're a sailor why don't you come along as a crew member. Okay Blackie, second chance, please, please don't do it. Damn, he signs on. From there you know he is a goner.

Why? Well, up front old Arthur has a partner, Grisby, who is also under Elsa's spell, at least enough to try to assist her in getting rid of the old goat by any means necessary.  I don't have to draw you a diagram on that proposition. The rest of the plot centers on making Blackie the fall guy for the murder of old Arthur. But as such things do, the best laid plans of mice and men sometimes go awry. Old Grisby winds up dead, Blackie winds up framed for murder and, naturally, Arthur feels duty-bound to defend him. Of course such a defense has a double-edge as Blackie will soon enough find out. And will find out soon enough as well that not all femme fatales are on the level when the heat is turned up. Love will only take you so far though, and then justice, rough justice anyway has to come into play. Still, if you ask Blackie in the sober light of day whether he would do it again, hell, you know the answer.  Black Irish is just another of old Rita's hoopsters. Stand in line brother.

Okay, now for the finale. How does this film, this great director Orson Welles' film, compare with Gilda? Well...let's say I'm partial to redheads, if I have a choice. And I am partial to ""good"" femme fatales with a little heart, as well. Especially if they can dance, strum a guitar, sing (okay, lip synch) and give that look (you know that look, right?) like old Rita did in Gilda. But, I am a man of the ocean so maybe, just maybe, I would sign on for that cruise. Hey, I never said I wasn't just another Rita hoopster. But this time my blood pressure is okay at the end,

***********

The twists and turns of the plot are not the only thing that is interesting here. Orson Welles not only acted in the film but wrote the screenplay and produced it. His touch shows in the startling black and white close ups of the characters, especially the husband (played by Everett Sloane) and his law partner, as they go through their paces. At the end the classic hall of mirrors confrontation between Hayworth and Sloan is pure  Welles. Welles may have had his ups and downs as actor, writer, director and producer but this effort holds up pretty well after 60 years.",1196380800,,5443,4.4324324324324325
449352,4,6302281849,"It feels like watching a preview of a great classic film noir. All the scenes are great, superb camera angles, beautiful vistas of natural sets, terrific lines all thru the movie. Everything is great; the cast, Rita is shockingly beautiful, as beautiful as Garbo was in ""Queen Christina""... it's got everything, I tell you. But the problem is it's just a preview: only 90 minutes when the original thing was 2 and a half hours. You can see through its surface, how void the whole story is.

By the end one doesn't know who killed whom, why, or what was it all about. But Rita, Oh my! She was gorgeous. If only Welles (The Black Irish) didn't play the role of a fool, and she didn't play the unbelievable character she played it would have been different (or was it really different in its original idea? We will never know).",1190678400,,824,4.493333333333333
449353,3,6302281849,"After all, you do not go to an Orson Welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy-ever-after star...

You go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings, lighted and scored imaginatively, photographed bravely, and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place...

As usual, as well as directing, Welles wrote the script and he also played the hero - a young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil, but still retained his clear-eyed trust in the goodness of others... Unfortunately for him, he reposed this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future... She was married without love, to an impotent, crippled advocate, acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane...

There is a youthful romanticism underlying it all, and this quality came into exuberant play in ""The Lady from Shanghai."" Before the inevitable happened, Welles escaped - to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of the post-war cinema ...

Welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere... His camera seemed almost to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web...",1167782400,4,1602,4.9664179104477615
449354,4,6302281849,"I must confess at the outset that I am an Orson Welles fan.  This is not to say that I am unaware of or wish to minimize his faults.  What I mean is that, for me, his work possesses a set of characteristics, not all of them completely definable even yet, which are nonetheless rich and compelling. Furthermore, I maintain that enough (all?) of this ""Welles aesthetic fingerprint survives the tribulation, sometimes extreme, to which his work was all too often subjected at the hands of others, to render even his lesser efforts very worthy of serious attention rewarded by enjoyment.

""The Lady from Shanghai"" illustrates the above very clearly. Welles made the film at a very serious juncture in her career.  His ""boy wonder"" reputation was fading rapidly. His political views were becomming less popular as the country began to move toward the right.  His radio work had begun to dry up. His finances were a shambles. In desperation, he turned to Harry Cohn, a man he had contemptuously attacked, to support his latest project. He meant ""The Lady from Shanghai"" to restore his reputation as a viable filmmaker, proof that he could make a film that would be ""aminstream"" enough to pay off at the box office, and yet not represent artistic capitulation to commercial Hollywood. It was also to be a both a starring vehicle and a ""stretch"" performance for his then-wife, Rita Hayworth.

Unfortunately, the film proved typical of most of Welles work in one significant way: it was taken out of his hands in post-production, and as a result, was, when released, by no means the film Welles had in mind.

I inssist, however, that it does manage to succeed to a great extent as an intelligent, originally handled thriller. Welles's genius for visual elements -- location, lighting, camera angles, etc, retain their fascination and beauty. A certain viewpoint still pervades the handling of plot and character -- satiric, bitter, increasingly surreal. And, I maintain, Rita Hayworth does ""stretch"" as an actress, creating, with, admittedly, a lot of help from her husband and his camera, a memorable femme fatale. The high quality of her performance is uniform with the rest of the cast, such as the very fine Everett Sloane.

The is a film not only for fans of Welles, such as myself, but for anyone who enjoys an intelligent film noir,",1163030400,3,2330,4.851385390428211
449355,5,6302281849,"The Lady from Shanghi's reputation is secure as a classic of film noir but then this genre is notoriously disrespected probably because many film noirs are based on dime novels and sound like it; in order to appreciate a film noir, therefore, you have to be able to enjoy the kitschy quality of snappy dime-novel dialogue. But kitsch alone is not what makes (some) film noirs great. What really sets film noir apart from other genres is its striking, even elegant, visual style which often contrasts sharply with its stark subject matter. Film noir has a way of glamourzing corruption, and giving corruption a unique aesthetic allure all its own. Film noir probably owes something to the German Expressionist film masters (Murnau, Lang, Von Stroheim) and the Hollywood grotesques of the 20's and 30's but it absorbs and evolves these influences into a highly refined style of its own. Orson Welles is the undisputed master of the high noir style. All of his films after Magnificent Ambersons mobilize film noir methods and techniques and so Welles' reputation rises and falls with that genre that he did not create but that he perfected.

Film noir came of age during WWII and like many film noirs Lady from Shanghai is about anxieties over race, class, sexuality, and identity and, in this particular noir film, negotiating racial, social, cultural and sexual difference in an increasingly globalized world. The film takes place in several international (Acapulco) and exotic (Chinatown) settings and these strange locales allow Welles to examine how his characters respond to a diverse array of atmospheres and social/cultural settings. Welles himself plays the central character in the film, Michael O'Hara, and to do so he affects an Irish accent (another international touch) that, some critics argue, is supposed to sound false/inauthentic. O'Hara has a way of talking that sounds a bit too self-consciously literary; and though he affects a working class worldliness his yarns sound like they come straight out of Conrad (O'Hara echoes many of Conrad's colonial concerns) and Hemingway (O'Hara echoes Hemingway's anti-Franco sentiments) and so we suspect that this character has spent more time reading and writing stories than in actually working. Whether we believe Michael's Irish brogue is authentic or not we know that he is fond of creating fictions and this casts suspicions on his identity as well as on his version of events that we hear on the voiceover. Furthermore, we can see that his obsession with literature has given him a taste for the romantic and the typically masculine posturing of his favorite literary heroes and instead of making him worldly wise this just makes him all the more gullible when a pretty lady and the promise of a new adventure come along.

Elsa (played by Welles' then-wife Rita Hayworth)identifies Michael as an easy mark the first time they meet. Unlike Michael Elsa actually is worldly and we can tell she's seen and experienced a lot and that she knows a lot about the world (not just read a lot about it) and she sees through Michael's pseudo-brogue and bravura right away and knows exactly how to exploit his romantic tendencies. She sums him up and plays him from the first moment they exchange knowing glances (hers much more knowing than his). Michael prides himself on his independence and his integrity but he just can't help falling for Elsa's pretend innocence and helplessness--its just too good to resist-- and he can't help wanting to come charging to her rescue even though there are signs everywhere that indicate that Elsa is in no need of rescuing. At first Michael resists her job offer but she is a woman who always gets her way and soon Michael is one of her employee/servants just like all of the other men in the film. Michael just can't tear himself away from Elsa's dangerously seductive & corruptive charms that he willingly and perhaps willfully misinterprets as innocence and helplessness only because that version of her makes him feel better about his own true motives. Michael has been hired on as an extra hand on Elsa's husband's yacht and as soon as he steps foot on deck everyone else aboard sizes him up and begins figuring how they can use him to further their own plots. Elsa's husband Bannister is a famous lawyer and both he and his partner Grisby are, like Michael, under Elsa's spell and trying to plot their way out of captivity. As the yacht pulls out of harbor we see the word ""Circe"" written in bold letters on the yacht's hull.

Elsa's past is a secret only hinted at (all we know is that she was born on an island somewhere in the east & spent some time in Shanghai). She looks like the penultimate American blonde but she is not from America and her cultural reference points are decidely eastern in contrast to Michael's western points of reference; to Michael she represents the unknown and perhaps the unkowable, and this is part of her allure and also what makes her so dangerous. ""Elsa"" is the prototypical femme fatale and the conventions of the film noir genre tell us that things will not end well for anyone that gets too close but she's just too enticing. The most famous scene of the film has Elsa in a sleek black bathing suit diving off some perilous rocks as if she were accustomed to such danger and as if danger was her natural element. But then she lays down to sunbathe on the rocks and from the relative safety of the boat Michael looking on, anxiously aware of how dangerous she is, can allow himself the comforting illusion that she is vulnerable and that she needs saving and that only he can save her not only from all the other male predators on board, but save her from her own eastern imbued fatalistism.

Elsa is so beautiful that she has all of the men in the film believing exactly what she wants them to believe and all of them believing that they've actually got a chance with her. And the men all slowly lose their head around her. Some of the men talk down to her but still they do what she says and she has all of them plotting against each other while lighting her cigarettes. The film has been criticized for having an impossibly tangled plot but I think the point of the film is that you are never supposed to be certain or not whether Elsa is merely defending herself against the men who want to control her or if Elsa has been in control of all of them (just like she has been in control of Michael) from the start. Even at the end we still want to believe that Elsa is a victim of something, perhaps something from her past that she just can't escape, but since we don't know what her past was we have no ultimate insight into what has been driving her all along nor for that matter do we have any insight into what originary crime or sin has been driving the men all along; all we know is that the sexes and the races and the classes are at odds. Elsa remains an unknown all the way through and Michael once ensnared must realize that he too is an unknown because under her influence he has been forced to act against what he perceived to be his own true nature.

The Lady from Shanghai offers some of the most stunning visuals of any film noir I know of. The Acapulco scenes are especially exciting as the danger and unpredictability of a foreign woman is made especially inviting and exciting in a foreign land. In this film Welles offers the ultimate noir vision of anxiously uncertain men and women attracted to each other but also repelled by what they find themselves attracted to and what they find themselves doing in the name of desire. Its a film noir and that means that the film follows certain recognizable conventions but it does more than simply follow those conventions, it pushes those conventions as far as they have been pushed and explores the nature of those conventions in a more thorough way than any noir before or, arguably, since. By the end of the film the characters have become lost in their own plots and no longer know who they are and this is conveyed brilliantly with Welles use of masks & mirrors in the celebrated and luridly twisted funhouse scene which feels a bit like the famous Dali sequence in Hitchcock's Spellbound but is even more disorienting & disconcerting (Spellbound was released in 1945 so it is possible, even likely, that Welles had seen it and that it influenced his own film that was made in 1946 and released in 1948). [In the extra featurette that follows the film we learn that Welles himself painted much of the funhouse props and set.]

There are a lot of bad noirs out there and these give the genre a bad name but the few good ones are among the best films ever made. Welles' reputation would be greater if film noir were better understood and appreciated not as a genre that is as cheap as the dime novels that inspired it but a genre where cinema explores its own methods and techniques.  The great directors from Lang & Von Stroheim to Welles & Hitchcock to Godard & Chabrol and the other new wave auteurs have all been attracted to noir for this reason.

A brilliant film. After this film (which was a commerical flop) Welles didn't work in America for ten years and when he did return to America he made Touch of Evil (another brilliant noir film). Touch of Evil also failed to generate revenue and effectively ended Welles career as a mainstream director even though he continued to make independently financed small pictures like Othello, Macbeth, The Trial & Chimes at Midnight.",1159315200,11,9487,4.673249551166966
449356,4,6302281849,"UPDATED FOR BLU-RAY RELEASE (6/23/14)

TCM has reissued ""The Lady from Shanghai"" as a blu-ray/DVD combo pack. The first issue on blu-ray used a single layer blu-ray disc and a fairly low bit rate for the transfer resulted in digital noise and other visual artifacts. TCM has quietly gone back to remaster the film putting it on a dual layered blu-ray at a higher bit rate. The result is a better blu-ray than the original release in early 2014.

The restored edition of the film for blu-ray looks quite nice and is an improved over the original standard DVD released by Columbia early in the decade.

One way to distinguish the two is that, some early editions of the blu-ray/DVD combo were released in a standard DVD case. The revised edition comes in a clear blu-ray sized case similiar to what Criterion uses to release their blu-rays. If you purchased the earlier edition, you may want to reach out to see if TCM will exchange the disc (there have been mixed results from this method with some folks evidently able to get it while others have been told no).

ORIGINAL DVD REVIEW (2006):

""The Lady from Shanghai"" crackles with Welles' energy and intelligence in spite of the tampering done during post-production by Columbia with the film. Welles ended up working his advesary Harry Cohn the head of Columbia on this unusual, imaginatively photographed (by the late great Rudolph Mate)noir thriller. This ""Lady"" is memorable if for nothing else than the amazing fun house scene at the conclusion of the movie.

Michael O'Hara (Welles)is immediately smitten with Rosalie (Rita Hayworth)the wife of the super wealthy Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane in a terrific performance). He ends up employed by Bannister on his yacht putting him close to his wife and making sparks fly with the amoral Rosalie. Money seduces Michael into participating in a faked murder of Bannister's law firm partner Grisby (a great performance by Glenn Anders)which turns from fantasy to reality and making Michael the primary suspect.

Welles' film is full of brilliant visuals, witty dialogue and lovely location work (particularly the sequences set in 1948 San Francisco). The last sequence in the funhouse full of mirrors is brilliant realized. Like Hitchcock Welles' liked to take genre conventions and turn them on their head with inventive, intelligent plots and visual sequences. Where the film goes wrong is in post-production. With the exception of ""Citizen Kane"" Welles ended up abandoning his babies or had them taken away from him and messed with by studio heads. ""The Lady from Shanghai"" is not an exception. Welles uses extremely close ups to make us feel as uncomfortable as Michael does about his employers and the situation he finds himself in when he realizes he's been duped.

From the insistence that Welles go back and shoot glamor shot close ups of his soon to be ex-wife Rita Hayworth to meddling in the editing room and the misbegotten musical score (a pity Welles didn't have Bernard Herrmann working on this film)enforced on the film ""The Lady from Shanghai"" ended up being compromised. A pity that Columbia hasn't tried to dig up the cut footage (if it exists) along with the temp score (they could recreate that based on Welles' notes)that Welles used to help ""guide"" Heinz Roemheld (who totally ignored Welles' notes and the temp soundtrack) It still manages to a classic Welles film despite all the interference. Roemheld's forte was scores more like the one he composed for ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" and he was totally out of his element here.

Columbia includes a fascinating commentary track by Peter Bogdanovich and vintage advertising to compliment this release. I just wish that Columbia had gone the route of Warner with ""Citizen Kane"" but the extras are pretty good overall. I'd highly recommend this now if Warner would get around to releasing ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" on DVD I'd be a happy camper...",1158278400,2,3917,4.977064220183486

449358,5,6302281849,"Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders.

The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, ""George Grisby,"" is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. Sloane isn't far behind in the ""strange"" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says.

Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints.

This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.",1152576000,3,1343,4.473469387755102
449398,5,6302281849,"The more one reviews the Welles' oeuvre, the more painful it becomes to watch his eternal attempts to disguise himself. This may seem a rather obvious observation, given the intrinsically autobiographical nature of Welles' art, but the boy genius was always cognizant of this confessional, which makes it all the more difficult and compelling. It seems that, for every film made after ""Citizen Kane"", the urge to dissemble becomes more pronounced, more helpless in its transparency and failure.  From a desperate Irish accent in ""The Lady from Shanghai"" to the patently false beard of ""Mr. Arkadin"" all the way to the volumes of onerous padding that bloat his Captain Quinlan in ""Touch of Evil"", Welles has created the ultimate gallery of character refractions in cinema.  The character of Michael O'Hara in ""Shanghai"", however, holds a special uniqueness in its reliance on and combination of youth, attractiveness, vigor, restlessness, sexual yearning, and finally, shrugging resignation and pessimism.  This was 1948, Welles was 33 years-old, five years wed to the stunning Rita Hayworth, two and one-half years estranged from her, still pseudo-blacklisted after ""Kane"", just returning from a much-publicized theater flop (""Around the World""), and like always, ready and confident in his ability to deliver something that no one had ever seen before.

Welles was able to accomplish this ambition with relative frequency because of his complete fascination with film and complete understanding of it as a transformative medium. There are moments of rapture and ""pure cinema"" in ""The Lady from Shanghai"" to rival ""Kane"".  Where else can something as ineffably sensual as the camera's flight over Hayworth's unrequited cigarette ballad on Bannister's yacht, or as ephemeral as the procession of barcos and torches to the bass thump of ""Baia"" in Acapulco be found on celluloid? Welles always bemoaned the brevity of the film post-studio cutting, but in truth, these moments possess just the perfect duration, and this essentially being a film about love interrupted, thwarted, and finally imploding, I suspect that Welles' pacing of most of the scenes in the movie was not entirely different.

Interruption and all its cosmic ramifications seem to be a primal force and theme in ""The Lady from Shanghai"".  Many of the most indelible moments erupt or are born out of seemingly nowhere. The wordless scene in which a gloriously clad Hayworth sprints desperately through the deteriorating arches of an Acapulco street against the strains of a Mexican band lasts nearly half-a-minute and emanates almost inexplicably from the narrative.  A man coughs ceaselessly in a courtroom, oversized marine life intrude on the central love scene, and finally, in the most conspicuous eruption, the three central characters are arbitrarily led into a hall of mirrors, where they proceed to blow the entire place apart. In short, whether the interruption is obstructive or cathartic, it throws the equilibrium off balance, and that may be why this film is so emotionally turbulent, why the playing of Welles and Hayworth at times resembles the rupturing of two adjacent membranes against one another, unable to touch without bruising themselves. The accepted interpretation of the film as a comment on the two's marriage, as a confession of the boy genius' inability to mantain a relationship with a mature, robust woman should therefore not imply that the experience of making or watching such a film is a fluid or healing one. Not even the fluidity of the film making, blithely inconsiderate of conventional and ""coherent"" narrative form, should suggest that. Both the allure and difficulty of the Welles canon is its destructive tumultuous self-romance and destructiveness, and ""Lady from Shanghai"" is no exception.",1150934400,15,3800,5.321666666666666
449399,4,6302281849,"What was once considered Orson Welles' most notorious failure is now regarded as a classic by movie buffs.  THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, the story of a man driven to obsession and murder by a beautiful blonde temptress, is filled with striking imagery and amazing performances.  Based on a novel by Sherwood King, the story focuses on world-weary crewman Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) who literally stumbles across the path of beautiful Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth), and almost on the spot he's invited to join the crew of her yacht, about to set sail on an international cruise, that soon dissolves into murder and mayhem.  The plot plays like classic film noir, with many twists and turns.  The film is highlighted by the famous `Hall of Mirrors' finale where Welles demonstrates the whole idea of the unknown enemy.

Rita Hayworth is sensational in one of her best roles.  It is a very famous story that she was personally recommended for the picture by her then-husband Orson Welles, but studio heads regarded the project as a B-picture and thus not worthy of one of their biggest box office stars.  Welles hacked off Hayworth's trademark red tresses and bleached it platinum blonde, in an effort to emphasize the fact that this was indeed a different movie, but it was also a different Hayworth, one the audience had never seen before.  THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI was a bitter disappointment for writer/director/star Orson Welles, who felt he was sabotaged by a studio who did not trust his vision.  The film was significantly edited by Columbia shortly after it's completion but was kept on the shelf for several months before it was finally released, to mostly scathing reviews.

The DVD contains audio commentary from well-known Welles fan and director Peter Bogdanovich, a featurette with Bogdanovich, the original trailer and vintage advertising gallery.",1142380800,20,1857,5.059016393442623

And in a very similar circumstance suffered by Susan in Touch of Evil, he will a wake in an amusement park to lead us to the famous sequence in the hall of mirrors. Fantasy, evasion and elusiveness three fundamental elements of the cinema will intersect in this phantasmagoric picture that so many films has inspired. The same Welles confessed in a famous interview in 1966: ""I believe, thinking about my films, that they are based not so much on pursuit as on a search. If we are looking for something, the labyrinth is the most favorable location for the search. I do not know why, but my films are all for the most part a physical search: a visual obsession.""

In this delirious movie converge basically all the elements present in the Shakesperian Tragedy, the unerring fatalism of the Noir Film and the absolute domain of the lens as a loyal and fervent mute storyteller through the visual imagery and the sordid environment where nothing seems worthy to trust. Welles explores the low depths of the unconscious through the gradual personality demolition and unavoidable deconstruction of the characters alienating the viewer to unbearable level. That' s exactly the cathartic device, to beat the soul through the catastrophe, without any possible handle.",1127779200,3,1774,4.8903654485049834
449401,4,6302281849,"This review is for the 2000 DVD release by Columbia.

The movie 'Lady from Shanghai' starts off knee-deep in cinematic chaos as Orson Welles portrays an Irish sailor named Mike O'Hara who walks up to a horse drawn buggy in New York with a lone female passenger who we later find out is named Elsa 'Rosalie' Bannister (Rita Hayworth).  O'Hara, in an unconvincing Irish accent, offers this beautiful blonde his last cigarette and even though Elsa doesn't smoke, she graciously accepts it.  Moments later O'Hara picks up Elsa's purse he found on the street and then sees her being chased in a park by three thugs.  In a poorly choreographed fight in fast film motion, O'Hara rescues Elsa from these street ruffians and somehow manages to borrow the horse and carriage and return her to her car.  As they approach her car, O'Hara admits being jailed in various parts of the world including Spain for killing a man (why he still isn't in jail for that serious of a crime isn't explained) and then talks about another murder in America where the primary suspect was acquitted due to having the best living defense attorney in the world.  By astronomical odds, it just so happens that this famous attorney is Elsa's husband and she offers him a job on her husband's yacht and admits that she intentionally dropped her purse on  the street so that Mike would find it.  O'Hara declines the job offer, but a short, unattractive and physically debilitated Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) tracks him down the following day and convinces Mike to work on his yacht and he finally agrees.

Inspite of these arguably trivial flaws, the movie goes into a lengthy, but by far the strongest segment of the film with examples of superb role development with the main characters on this New York to San Francisco sailing trip.  As Mike and Elsa begin a romantic tryst on the sailing excursion, Arthur's law partner George Grisby (Glenn Anders) joins the voyage in a surprise visit leaving Mike and Elsa uncertain if he discovered their secret relationship.  But as time goes on during the journey, the film reveals Arthur as a ruthless, wealthy man who inspite of his physical limitations, belittles everyone around him since he believes they can either be bought with his wealth or ruined by his legal power in the courts.  He also reveals a sense of awareness that he might be killed and also publicly talks to his wife in a habitually condescending way.  His law partner George appears to be paranoid and a seemingly self-loathing man who, like Arthur, has a disgraceful habit of getting very drunk and dreadfully obnoxious at social gatherings.  Mike has finally witnessed enough of Arthur's and George's despicable behavior, and metaphorically compares them to a school of sharks he once witnessed attacking and eating each other until the sea was black with their blood.  Near the end of the trip, George proposes a bizarre request to Mike.  He wants Mike to kill him.  But we later we find out that George wants Mike to appear to kill him, but not kill him at all.  This sets up the remainder of the film where several murders are committed and Mike appears to be a patsy for a complicated murder scheme.

The next segment of the movie deals with a sensational and cinematically ""over the top"" court trial and then builds up to a suspenseful and action-packed ending.  As in the opening segment of the film, the end of the film has some flaws too, but uses some very creative artistry in a room full of mirrors for an incredibly  memorable climax.  Overall, the film is still very entertaining and the characters were unique and interesting, but when the film is finally over, there's a disappointing sense that this Orson Welles film lacks the distinct greatest of his previous and some of this future films.  I watched this movie a second time to be sure that I didn't overlook some underlying stroke of genius, but no startling revelations were found the second time around.  By watching the DVD Bonus Featurette, it's revealed that this movie was initially approximately 150 minutes long, but was later reduced to 87 minutes after some disappointing preview screenings.  One has to wonder how much of the deleted material weakened perhaps what's left of a skeletal remains of a film.  Rita Hayworth never looked better in her short, blonde hair and certainly help make this movie very viewable.

The B&W picture quality of this movie was disappointing.  It's relatively sharp and the graininess varies, but it's clearly unrestored and could have used some minor cleaning up throughout the entire film.  Some tiny specs of film deterioration can be observed continuously throughout the entire movie.  Another Columbia release I watched recently, 'Gilda' was also of similar poor quality, which I find inexcusable for a major studio.  There are several bonus extras to this film including a short Featurette along with real-time commentary by Peter Bogdanovich, plus production notes, trailers and talent files.

449403,5,6302281849,"Orson Welles displays once again his cinematic genius in his intriguing film noir thriller ""The Lady from Shanghai"".  In a flick full of plot twists Welles plays Irish brogued seaman Michael O'Hara who has a chance encounter with the alluring Rita Hayworth.  Hayworth playing Elsa Bannister is the trophy wife of a wealthy, clever but physically challenged attorney Arthur Bannister played terrifically by Everett Sloane.  Hayworth minus her trademark red tresses in favor of a short blonde hairdo was unquestionably one of the most gorgeous women to have ever graced the silver screen.  She also proves to be a pretty fair actress in her role as a femme fatale in this flick.

Welles is coaxed by Hayworth into working as a mate on her husbands yacht which will cruise through the Panama Canal from the east to west coast.  While on board Welles falls for Hayworth.

While cruising they pick up Bannister's law partner the obnoxious George Grisby played nicely by Glenn Anders.  Anders entices Welles with a plot to fake his own death so that he might disappear.  Welles stands to make $5000, with which he hopes to run away with Hayworth.

All is not as it seems, as Welles is duped in a plot hatched by the law partners but with several unexpected twists.

Welles' worthy screen play is enhanced by some good acting performances and first rate camera work.  The final scene shot in the mirror maze in an abandoned funhouse was a superb surrealistic delight.",1121990400,,1460,4.819277108433735
449404,3,6302281849,"Orson Welles directed ""Lady from Shanghai"" and stars as Michael O'Hara, a mysterious down-on-his-luck sailor.  As the film opens, O'Hara meets the beautiful Rosalie Bannister (Rita Hayworth) by rescuing her some street thugs; however, little is as it seems, and O'Hara finds himself quickly drawn into Rosalie's life.  Turns out that Rosalie is actually married to a powerful lawyer, Arthur Bannister.  Soon O'Hara, against his better judgment, is working on the couple's yacht and everything gets more and more complicated.

""Lady from Shanghai"" is one of Hayworth's most famous starring roles, and it's easy to see why - she looks amazing and is quite good.  However, the film is disappointing.  In particular, the plot is unnecessarily convoluted: the focus seems to be on fancy camera work.  The close-ups and numerous pans certainly create an atmospheric film.  After revolutionizing movie directing six years earlier with ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles was obviously won't to continue his flashy directing here.  However, the elements don't mesh well, at the expense of character and plot development.  Film noir is always a risky proposition because of the labyrinthine plots, but one cannot rely on atmosphere alone.  Also, the film veers toward haminess at times, particularly Welles' thick Irish brogue.  The movie is, however, undeniably fascinating.  The hall of mirrors sequence is especially fun, although it's been emulated many times since.

The backstory is also typical of a Welles film.  Despite being known for her long red hair, Welles had Hayworth cut her get her hair cut short and dyed platinum blonde.  The studio understandably had a fit: just one more of Welles' career battles with producers.  In this case, however, Welles did not deliver an incontestable classic with the mettle of a ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Magnificent Ambersons.""  Instead, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" is an atmospheric but somewhat bizarre film noir that stops well short of greatness; nevertheless the film is a must-see for a number of reasons.",1118448000,6,2029,5.2875
449405,4,6302281849,"There's no question that ""The Lady From Shanghai"" boasts the most visually stunning final 10 or 12 minutes in the history of cinema.

The scene in the fun house, culminating in the famous hall of mirrors sequence just can't be topped, either in its imagination or its execution.  There's nothing quite like it anywhere else.

Getting there, however, is where the controversey about this film ignites.

As other reviewers have noted, the plot has more holes than a slab of swiss cheese and requires a rather serious suspension of disbelief for the viewer to go along for the ride.  Once that decision has been made, the journey is chock-full of some of Welles' most subtle touches, as well as some of his most confusing and infuriating.  A good example of the former is O'Hara's (Welles) hike up the mountain outside Rio with Grisby.

Play close attention to the people going up and down the mountain in the background and how they comment on the improbable tale that Grisby is spinning.  It's one of those sly, subtle touches that's so typical of Welles at his finest.  Also, look for Errol Flynn's walk-on in the scene outside the cantina.  Who else would cast Errol Flynn as an extra?

On the other hand, there's Rita Hayworth's song while lying flat on her back on the deck of the Bannister yacht.  The scene is as unnecessary as it is implausible, and was probably there at the studio's insistence.  But, given that the whole film was Hayworth's gift to ex-husband Welles - rather than the other way around, as Orson tells it - you never know exactly whose idea it was.

""The Lady From Shanghai"" is, in the final analysis, a good example of the prodigal, rather than the prodigious, nature of Welles' genius.  While the moments of genius are so amazing that I would recommend this film to anyone, its flaws are many and confounding.

Still, you have to see it for those last 12 minutes!",1115683200,3,1890,4.647590361445783
449406,4,6302281849,"Several films in the history of cinema either become timeless or fade away in time.  Lady from Shanghai is one of these timeless contributions to film history, but it is not ageless due to its story.  The true ambitiousness of the film is the cinematography and the mise-en-scene, which reaches its pinnacle at the end of the film in the fun house where Orson Welles uses his magical touch in order to elevate the story into timelessness.  Welles' artistry in cinema has later been studied and used repeatedly in order to enhance the cinematic experience of a mass of films.  This is what makes Lady of Shanghai a masterpiece, as it can withstand the test of time.

The film opens with a narration by Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles), a seaman with something of a dubious past, where he introduces how he got into the mess that he is about to enter.  One night in a park O'Hara is taking a night stroll as he encounters a beautiful woman, Rosalie (Rita Hayworth), that is riding in a coach.  Infatuated O'Hara approaches her and offers her a cigarette, which she accepts even though she does not smoke.  Shortly after Rosalie has left, three strangers attack her.  Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, O'Hara discovers Rosalie's situation and comes to her rescue.  This is the foundation for a treacherous tale of murder, deceit, and greed.

The Lady from Shanghai has several elements that make it a good film.  The cinematography, mise-en-scene, and the script offer moments of Welles' brilliance.  The first two have already been mentioned, but the script has portions of delicate planning as well as creative metaphors. One of the metaphors used is another reason why the film is considered a masterpiece.  O'Hara gives Rosalie, her husband Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), and George Grisby (Glenn Anders) descriptive analogies to their behavior in regards to a shark he once caught on a hook while fishing where the shark is attacked by other sharks around that began to eat each other in a frenzy.

Orson Welles, who then was married to Rita Heyworth, the films female protagonist, brings real emotional tension between them.  This could probably be true tension, as the two got divorced the following year.  Nonetheless, Welles and Heyworth offer the audience great performances as the independent O'Hara and the stunning Mrs. Bannister.

Lady of Shanghai does not measure up with Welles' previous masterpieces Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) as these two stories offer deeper and more developed insights into humanity.  The film studio might be to blame for why Lady of Shanghai did not reach the same level as his two earlier films, as they cut down Welles' original 155-minute version to 86 minutes.  Nonetheless, Welles got out some of his socioeconomic messages in the film, but they might feel somewhat interrupted as his full vision never was released.  The climatic ending in the fun house was also severely truncated by the studio where Welles displays a marvelous way of depicting the true nature of each character through the use of mirrors. Ultimately, Lady from Shanghai offers a good cinematic experience; however, having the knowledge of the massacre on the artistry in the film brings to light the film's possibilities.",1106179200,17,3267,5.00184842883549
449407,4,6302281849,"Had Orson Welles been making this movie up as he shot along it could hardly be more confusing.  That may well have been what he did and the story doesn't make a lick of sense.  Still, the bizarre characters, staging and editing have a mesmerizing quality to them that keeps ""Lady"" enjoyable if your tastes run to the unusual in movies.  An Irish seaman is taken on as yacht skipper for a rich San Francisco lawyer, then set up for a murder rap.  Welles pays a tribute to Rita Hayworth in his last lines, admitting that he was unlikely ever to get over her; she and Everett Sloane are particularly memorable.",1100044800,4,607,4.441441441441442
449418,3,6302281849,"I'm such a fan of Pookles that I barely remembered that this is a sliced and diced studio edit that decimates the real tone and objective (or is that subjective?) of the film. I just love listening to him rebel against everything and everyone. The mellowdrama is quite grating in some scenes, but overall, it works as a romantic thriller. The story behind how the movie came to pass is typical Orson. Where most people would write scripts and spend a liftime being rejected, he just makes it as a favour for Sam Goldwyn, who gave him thousands of dollars to get his costumes out of hock in time for the opening of Welles' stage adaptation of 'Around the world in 80 days!'

The scene on the Yaught (which belonged to Erroll Flynn), between Banister(Everett Sloane) and Ohara(Welles) is predictable but obvious Welles Genius.

Banister: Tell me Michael, are you independently wealthy?

Ohara: I'm independent...

B:Of money?

O: I've always found it very sanitary to be broke.

Another great scene is when Banister cross examines himself!

The mirror hall at the end is a very farcical, wellsian caper, and the aquarium is downright spooky.

The story of Welles and Hayworth's rocky marrige is well documented, and there are a few allusions to what was and what should never be. Her hair looks great short and blonde. A real pre cursor to Monroe.",1099353600,4,1345,4.767241379310345
449419,5,6302281849,"Welles has so much imagination whether he's shooting a scene in an aquarium, a hall of mirrors, or on a beach he always has the ability to effect you like no other director.

449420,5,6302281849,"No, not Welles' best film.  It couldn't be, since ""The Lady From Shanghai"" was actually a chance for Welles to get back in good with the studio system, a.k.a. the money picture that gets made when they won't let you be an artist.  (Too, he saw it as a chance to rebuild the waning relationship he shared with then-wife Rita Hayworth.)  However, the problem with Welles is that he excels so much at filmmaking that his worst still runs circles around most other directors' best.  At 90 minutes long, this is basically an annotated version of the 2 1/2-hour cut Welles had submitted for release prints.  Once again (reiterating Welles' career-long battles with his producers) unapproved editors were cut lose on it.  But it's still one of the most gleefully dizzy and fun time machines I've come across.  The colorful black-and-white cinematography comes off as disjointed due to the editing.  But it's a blessing in disguise.  Film noir dictates that shadows rule, both literally and figuratively.  The darkness pulls the strings, and ""The Lady..."" lives up to that.  It becomes a whirlwind journey that lands Mike O'Hara between South America and San Francisco's Chinatown, not to mention rendering him (and us) helpless under Hayworth's mesmerizing crooning on the deck of a boat.  Yes, and the infamous, unparalleled ""showdown"" in a funhouse hall-of-mirrors, bringing the thematics of the genre to life as reflections and each spouse's altar ego are shattered into shards one by one.  But I also harbor a cheap fascination with the world as it existed long before I was previed to it.  '40s and '50s noir have the ability to instantly transplant viewers to forty or fifty years before whatever is presently happening outside their window.  By no means the deepest picture released under the Welles filmography, ""The Lady From Shanghai"" remains a joyous, unabashed rollercoaster through the seediness of negative human nature.  Capital escapism.",1088726400,5,1946,5.091482649842272
449421,5,6302281849,"Stupidity--not innocence, not heroism, not any virtue at all--is the major theme of *The Lady from Shanghai*.  Therefore, to some viewers this film will appear to be a stupid movie.  That's unfortunate, but that's Orson Welles.
Everybody--EVERYBODY--is stupid in *Lady*!  The Welles character, Michael O'Hara, admits he is stupid right off the bat.  Elsa, played by Rita Hayworth, seems to be the cleverest of them all until the end...when she and her husband Arthur Bannister die together in the Crazy House, her husband gasping at her, ""For a clever girl you make a lot of mistakes.""  Arthur, ""the world's greatest lawyer"", obviously has brains and knows what's going on through the whole story, but he's so grotesque (practically crawling through his scenes like a daddy longlegs spider) that his intellect is self-defeating: he's just one of the sharks that Welles describes in the beach scene, ravenously devouring himself.  And the Grisby character...take one look at this guy and it's hard to believe *Lady* was made in 1946. Grisby's right out of David Lynch, or more like it, David Cronenberg!  The judge, the folks in the courtroom...all STUPID and distorted, just like the images in the funhouse mirrors!
Portraying American people in that unflattering light was just not ""on"" in the early postwar period.  No wonder Orson Welles was being watched by the FBI during those years.  Even today, many filmgoers expect movies to give them at least one or two heroic characters that they can identify with.  Sorry, friends, *Lady* jumps right into your face and right into your space (like the scene with O'Hara and Grisby overlooking the ocean) and blurts drunkenly, ""Yer STOO-pid too, FELLAH!""
But why on earth is Orson Welles telling us we're all stupid?  That's made very clear.  We are blissfully living out our grubby little lives on the brink of self-destruction.  ""Do you believe the world is gonna end?"" asks Grisby of O'Hara in that ocean overlook scene.  That's the question Welles tells us we should be asking ourselves.  But just as O'Hara was too stupid to ask himself a few simple questions, like ""how can Grisby collect the insurance money if he's declared legally dead?"", we don't ask ourselves the important questions that overshadow our silly little existences.
A lot of people won't like it.  They sure didn't when *Lady* was released in '48.
But I love it!  *Lady* was ""postmodern"" before postmodern was cool (before anybody knew what postmodern was)!  It is deliciously self-referential: the scene in the Shanghai Low Chinese theater, with the strange Oriental play being performed onstage, instantly reminds one of all the strange characters and goings-on in the ""real"" story, the movie itself.  But the movie itself is not real either, of course--it too is a play that reflects the bizarre world of human events, OUR world, the world of the moviegoer who seeks meaning in film and theater.  House of mirrors!  Movies of the '40's were just NOT self-referential, they really tried to create an alternative world that the audience could escape from its troubles into.  Almost all movies then, and still most today, do not hold up a mirror to the audience.  But *Lady* does.  And still today many people aren't going to like what they see.  ""It's a bright guilty world,"" sayeth Welles/O'Hara.
The close-ups of Rita Hayworth singing ""Please Don't Kiss Me"" establish her as THE most beautiful woman to have ever graced the silver screen.  Sorry Marilyn, Lana, Bette, and you too Nicole.  ""Rita Hayworth gave good face"" indeed.  I'd have paid the price of the whole DVD just to have those few seconds of film.  But there's so much more in *Lady* that's worth watching than the lady.
Peter Bogdanovich's interview and commentary is pretty good, though as a Welles/Hayworth fan there was a good deal of stuff I already knew.  But some stuff I didn't know, so I appreciated Peter's contribution.

449422,4,6302281849,"An often bewildering parody of film noir in particular and Hollywood conventions in general, Columbia relegated ""The Lady from Shanghai"" to B-movie status due to objections over Orson Welles' manipulation of soon-to-be-ex-wife Rita Hayworth into a ruthless femme fatale.  However, Hayworth's metamorphosis is the most superficial of the caricatures that populate the film, among them Everett Sloane (Bernstein from ""Citizen Kane"") as a leering, corrupt, crippled lawyer, and show-stealing Glenn Anders as the giddily inscrutable Grisby, whose machinations drive what passes for a plot.  Amidst this gallery, Welles' own sublimely ridiculous presence, as a hopelessly idealistic sailor with a phony ""Black Irish"" accent, becomes the most obvious tip-off that the proceedings are anything but serious fare.  Once the comic tone is established, the film lurches forward with manic energy, throwing plausibility to the wind as it careens toward the climax in the expressionistic Crazy House and its Hall of Mirrors.  The flattering close-ups of Hayworth (inserted by the studio to ""save"" the picture) clash marvelously with Welles' vertiginous camera angles, adding to the film's discontinuity and enhancing its satirical nature.

Unfortunately, during his tenure, Welles generally ticked off the ruling class and as a result, all of his masterpieces suffered at the hands of lesser men, determined to ruin Welle's screen legacies by chopping them up.  Such is the case with ""The Lady from Shanghai"", a convoluted thriller about a guy who meets a woman who may want to have her husband killed or may not and sets up another guy to frame Welles for....oh, hell!  Trust me, it's a real mind twister and just like ""The Big Sleep"" the ending makes no sense. Columbia executives took Welles' masterpiece apart after he had already departed for greener pastures and what remains is a 98 min. movie that really makes no sense. Having said that, the film left a lasting impression on me and a favorable one.
Welles genius lays in his camera work, his ability to create mood and an unsettling atmosphere that can rival any film noir of his day or the present.  Rita Hayworth, who by this time was ending her marriage to Welles, is the lady in question, her hair cut short and dyed blonde - both of which infuriated Columbia studio boss, Harry Cohen who put Hayworth on suspension shortly thereafter.
Columbia Home Video has done a remarkably fine job on the transfer of this movie.  Contrast level is superb.  Clarity is remarkable, even to the most minute detail in costume and set design.  The moody film noir atmosphere is well represented.  The audio, though mono, is also exceptionally well represented. No extras, save a brief little featurette and some stills.  This is not a jam packed DVD but one that will definitely impress nevertheless.

However, after watching it again for a second and third time, I am of a different opinion.  This film CAN be followed, but not in the conventional way.  While the film's twists and turns and double-crosses make little sense story wise, thematically everything falls into place.  My appreciation for this film has grown over the years.
Orson Welles plays Michael O'Hara, an Irish drifter and Spanish Civil War veteran who's troubles begin when he falls for an alluring woman by the name of Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth).  Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a crippled, sinister old man who happens to be the world's greatest lawyer.  Bannister hires Michael to go on a cruise through the Caribbean with him and his neurotic partner George Grisby.
...This entertaining film noir doesn't make a lot of sense story wise.  People double-cross each other for no apparent reason.  There are many twists and turns that are virtually impossible to follow.  Even the title is somewhat misleading, as the film has little to do with Shanghai, apart from the fact that the title character was born there.  Like that other film noir classic, ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Lady from Shanghai"" is more about style than substance.  One must listen to some of the characters' quotes to make sense of what is going on.
They are as follows:
""It is difficult for love to last long, therefore one who loves passionately, is cured of love in the end.""
""He who follows his nature, follows his original nature in the end.""
There's also a memorable speech that Michael gives about some sharks he once saw and what became of them.

Sure, a lot of it is implausible and weird--but if you can willingly suspend your disbelief you are in for a rich noir ride. The writing is superb, the locations are exotic and evocative, and this baby is dark and cynical to its core! Rita Hayworth proves herself an excellent actress--to balance all of the flesh Welles so lovingly displays of his soon ex-to-be. Why Welles had to saddle himself with the accent is truly beyond me, and I felt it didn't work that well--although it didn't ruin the picture. All the supporting players are evil and sweaty, especially Everett Sloan as the crippled cuckold. I think that crippling is the central metaphor in the film, but more so emotional crippling. All of these people are just twisted and broken inside, and they can't even begin to understand love, loyalty, and compassion. Visually this is portrayed by the funhouse mirror scene, an obvious reference to their narcissism and inability to connect to others as they really are. Well, enough psychobabble. The DVD has some nice extras and we learn a lot about the history and making of the film. Bogdanovitch does a commentary that is rich in many ways, but has two central problems: it is not linked to what is happening on the screen, and it becomes very repetitive at a certain point. This is a gripe I have with a lot of commentary tracks--someone turns on a mic and the subject blabs on without really talking directly about the great stuff happening RIGHT NOW in the movie. The best tracks are very focused on the film, and they integrate all of their information into it.

449471,5,6302281849,"The most tragic aspect of Orson Welles' career is the accepted wisdom that he only made three good films. In fact he made 13 films in a 40 year career (a tragically small number in itself) and ten of them were arguably masterpieces. That's a track record that bears comparison with anyone.
The Lady from Shanghai is a classic example of a misunderstood Welles masterpiece. The studio didn't understand the plot and the film got buried; in addition it was put forward that Welles intended revenge on his ex-wife Rita Hayworth by casting her as the bad girl (in fact Welles only interest was in making a great film and Hayworth's astonishing performance merely consecrates his success).
Welles fully understood the attractions, both of film noir themes (jealousy, greed, paranoia) and the mandatory visuals that go with the genre. The great cinematographer Stanley Cortez once said of Welles that he understood lighting better than anyone in the Cinema. Many scenes stand out as examples of Welles' brilliant visual invention - the lovers meeting at the aquarium and the final ""hall of mirrors"" shootout are just two outstanding set pieces amongst a miasma of unsettling camera angles, close-ups and deep, overbearing shadows. Welles' unique talent was in reinventing himself with every film, so whilst there are familiar Wellesian hallmarks in Shanghai (overlapping dialogue, deep focus etc) it is still a work of stunning visual originality, albeit shot in 16mm.
What the french call ""mise en scene"" (literally ""composition"") was everything to Welles, so the plot (an innocent man is drawn into a web of intrigue by a woman) was less important, save to the extent that it enabled Welles to delve into the emotional dynamics of the characters. For example, the fracturing relationship between Welles' (the actor) and Hayworth's characters is dealt with in an uncommonly sophisticated manner for what is essentially a femme-fatale/innocent-chump storyline.
So buy this and marvel at the work of Cinema's only natural (and greatest ever) inventor. And while you're at it, see The Trial, Othello, Chimes at Midnight, F for Fake, Macbeth and The Stranger as well.",1012780800,104,2158,5.150997150997151

Directed by Orson Welles
Writing Credits:  Sherwood King(Novel)  Orson Welles (Screenplay)
Cast: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth
 The movie opens with the stunning image of Rita Hayworth; it is this moment that captures her beauty and essence in a single camera shot.  Then the rest of the movie is a deconstruction of that beauty until the very ending scene.  This film has its good points and its bad points, to be sure.  I found the overlaying dialogue to be cumbersome at times, and rather simple and base.  This movie certainly accomplishes more visually than it does through dialogue.

 A good example of this is the classic ""hall of mirrors"" scene that brings the film to a dramatic conclusion.  The film work and originality was mesmerizing: and it has been copied in several films since then.  But the wonder of this scene is in part to the symbolism that it employs, although not as subtley as I would have liked.  The ending sentiments-that deception can be likened to sharks who, in a feeding frenzy, tear each other to pieces-is one worth pondering.  It certainly speaks to us about human failing and I believe this is purposeful.  These mirrors can be the images that we project of ourselves to the outside world: the many personalities that we pretend to be.  But who are we really?  It seems that when we try to pin each other down, we don't know them anymore than we know ourselves:
  ""Are you pointing that gun at me ... I'm pointing at you.""
This line (as spoken by Hayworth's husband) captures the essence of the scene and the greater theme at hand.  I believe in many ways that this is a reflection of Welle's own personal life.  It seems that his marriage with Hayworth was already failing at this point, thus explaining a few finer points.  Welles has Hayworth dye her hair platinum blonde (instead of her natural red hue that she is famous for).  As mentioned, the opening scene of her beauty is a false one that is constantly challenged at every turn-leading to her final destruction.  This film illicits the emotions and feelings of a man dealing with reality; reality of life and the truth about people.
 In summary, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" is definitely worth seeing if one enjoys classic films and Orson Welles.  Watch, in particular, for Welles' exploration of what is real and what isn't-you won't be sure until the final conclusion.",1006992000,8,2392,4.731234866828087
449473,4,6302281849,"The difficulty the viewer faces in interpreting this film may be the first sign of its complexity. Simplicity and complication are of the same essence in this film. As we listen to the tales of cross-purpose concocted by Hayworth in the sequence taking place in the San Francisco aquarium, the close-ups of her icey beauty are offset by lurid projections of monstrous fish of collassal stature. A segment less famous but of no less important than that of the ""Hall of Mirrors"" that crowns the plot, the uncanny illuminations and chiaroscuro reveals Welle's style at his best: the female is both a menacing figure of deceit but also an agent of sardonic hilarity, of metaphysical farce that even Hitchcock or Renoir could not attain in their frontal close-ups of spellbinding women. The glass that separates the bizarre creatures from the two lovers is what will splatter and crash at the final meeting of the three protagonists in the ""crazy house"", where prismatic multiplication of the images of the characters foregrounds the two spouses shooting their phantom images to bits. A carnival of destruction ensues, mirrors blasted until the bullets finally reach the two figures. A cinematic potlatch, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI celebrates and consumes its madness!",1006214400,2,1260,5.121359223300971
449474,4,6302281849,"Orson Welles' ""The Lady from Shanghai"" to me, starts out a bit slow, but once it gets started there's nothing else like it. Welles stars as Michael O'Hara, a man that has fallen for another man's wife. But when that woman is Rita Hayworth, can you blame him? Welles based his screenplay on the novel ""If I Die Before I Wake Up"" by Sherwood King, I have never read this book (I usually read French and Russian literature) but Welles gives this movie a creepy, dark, mysterious mood, that makes great noir films what they are. Arthur Bannister played by Everett Sloane is one of the most famous lawyers around, mostly because he's a crook. And his wife Elsa (Hayworth) wants her husband to try and influence Michael to come along with them. You see the day before Michael saved Elsa's life while she was being attack in a park. For his reward he gets to work on their boat. After some debate Michael agrees. But is that a mistake? Soon Michael is accused of a murder he never commited. And wants to leave with Elsa. While Arthur tries to defend him as his lawyer. Right when everything seems as if Michael will go down, a small glimmer a hope arises.
 ""The Lady from Shanghai"" proves Welles was a great director, and that ""Citizen Kane"" was not a fluke. There is good timing between Welles and Hayworth, I believe they were married when this was made. And the ending is a classic, in the fun house. Who can forget those two famous lines: ""I'm pointing at you, lover!"" & ""Killing you is killing myself,but,you know,I'm pretty tired of both of us."" ""Shanghai"" will prove to be a treat for those who love noir films. It ranks among the best!",1003017600,4,1636,4.471571906354515
449475,5,6302281849,"I have to be Welles biggest fan!! Some people get confused about his films from the opening of the credits. Welles' flicks are always confusing, pervers, dramatic, often uncontrolled fits of dramatic power. Lady From Shanghai is one the best film noir's ever! The story is built around Welles as Michael O'Hara a dim witted sea man caught in the troubled marriage of Hayworth and Sloane. The film takes so many plot turns and twist that at key elements the camera takes dramatic drops and angle changes to keep the viewer off balance and unstable and it works! As the flick progreses Welles' character fallls for Hayworth and trys to win her love through a plot to help hayworth's husband business partner kill himself. But the plan is not all out in the opoen and the proposition laid in front of him by Sloanes partner played by a creepy and enchanting Glenn Anders is such a plot shifter you may fall off the couch in disbelief! Rather it's Hayworth trying to escape her husbands spys on a moon lit walk or the infamous hall of mirrors climax with glass, bullets, and screams or the courtroom chaos of Welles escape the visual style is pulse pounding! The flick is a pleasure from start to end the script is delicious and witty too - the beach scene where Welles' explains human nature through a shark analogy is awe inspiring. the camp fire giving his natural glowing eyes and cherub face a heightened intensity! The film is perfect in evry sense of the word! This is the best film that Hayworth ACTED in. She uses her looks and a newly found gravel to her voice that just resonates. The original running time was close to 3 hours but as it stands now with all the noir in play and visual treats abundant you will wonder how this film escaped your viewing for such a long period of time!",990662400,5,1791,4.513846153846154
449476,5,6302281849,"Another must-have in your DVD collection, Orson Welles's THE LADY FROM SHANGHA is presented by Columbia Pictures in a superb copy with a commentary of well-known critic and director Peter Bogdanovich. Four trailers, the filmographies (highlights...) of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth and a featurette presenting an interview with Peter Bogdanovich complete the program of this DVD.
THE LADY FROM SHANGHA is not entirely the movie Orson Welles wanted to present to the audience, Columbia's boss Harry Cohn having sent back the movie to the editing room after the first screening. However, the genius of Orson Welles is still there with a certain number of anthology scenes that are part of Movie History now. Personally, I have always felt a little uneasy with the character played by Glenn Anders, the mad lawyer who proposes Orson Welles the strangest deal of all. The scene in Acapulco between an hysterical Anders and a naive Welles is a sheer moment of genius.
According to Peter Bogdanovich, Orson Welles, in front of those who wondered why he had to present in his movies so strange and flamboyant takes, was always surprised because for him these ""strange"" scenes reflected the way he saw things, they were natural to him. We are not used anymore to such personalities able to create a coherent personal artistic world, we have to swallow so many anonymous movies each year that a film like THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI cannot but act as a healthy bomb for our polluted brain cells.

449477,5,6302281849,"In my teens, Welles was just a fat guy with a deep voice, until my father recommended I see ""The Lady From Shanghai"" at the cinema. It was the first film I saw which truly opened my eyes to the camera's eye. After RKO gave Welles the sack, & Hearst's Hollywood sympathisers all but ruined his reputation, Orson made ""The Stranger""--on time & within budget to renew studio bosses' faith in him. I believe this is why Harry Cohn gave him another go at Hollywood. Cohn bit hook line & sinker. Welles then cast his wife, the beautiful Rita Hayworth & gave her her first role as the villian. He made a radical, spellbinding film for 1948,of which audiences missed the point & criticised the plot. This ""unusual"" masterpiece shut Welles out of Hollywood for a good few years to come~(The beginning of his lifelong struggle to make films)~. All because he remained true to himself & his art. The ""mirrors-scene"" at the end is one of the most unforgettable scenes in cinema history ~(it's been copied many times)~. This alone was worth Orson's struggle,in my view. A must see to believe. Can't give anymore away, if you haven't seen it. If you like Welles, you're gonna love this movie. A classic, worth every penny for the DVD. Give it a go.",973728000,5,1234,4.563063063063063
7823654,5,6302281849,"I'm 100% born and bred Irish, and Orson Welles' cod-Irish accent in this one makes me beam from ear to ear everytime I hear it. But then I'm a massive Orson Welles fan, and this is one of his films that I'll never tire watching, even though it's been too long since my last viewing.

If studio head Harry Cohn couldn't make sense of the plot well then that's good enough for me, and you'll have no worries about spoilers, to be sure, to be sure (and that's the last cod-Irish you'll have to suffer through in this review, and that's a promise, to be... :) ).

In outline, though, its about Orson's Irish seaman-adventurer being invited on a working cruise by celebrity lawyer (Everett Sloane), in gratitude for Orson rescuing Sloane's wife, the lovely Rita, from a mugging in night-time Central Park. Accompanying them on the cruise are a couple of shady types, who're not as they seem, who later end up dead. Orson is framed and arrested and tried for the murder of the second of them (Glenn Anders) but he manages to escape following a courtroom melee, after faking a suicide attempt. Like another great California-set crime movie Masterpiece, we end up, appropriately enough, in Chinatown, where murderer, if not convincing motive, is revealed, following a shootout in a fairground Hall of Mirrors.

I particularly loved: Orson's over-the-top performance and accent; platinum blonde short-haired Rita (although the tossed-hair over-the-shoulder shot of redhead 'Gilda' Rita is one of my all-time fave screen moments); Everett Sloane's performance; Everett Sloane's attention-demanding limp; the courtroom scene's crowd shots/expressions/dialogue; Rita speaking Chinese, familiarly, to the Chinese characters (I'd like to think it was similar gibberish as for the 'black Mass' in Ulmer's delightful 'The Black Cat'); Glenn Anders performance; the  wonderfully human judge; the cinematography, particularly the 'grotesque' close-ups, (which I think might have inspired Roman Polanski in films such as 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Tenant'), and the various court building 'no smoking' signs, blissfully ignored (the latter, perhaps an apt metaphor for its maverick break-all-the-rules director)

I don't know: Touch of Evil has long been my fave Orson (and I love all three versions), and Chimes At Midnight is a contender, with maybe 'Othello' and then 'Mr. Arkadin' next after 'Shanghai'. This one is just fun, fun, fun; a rare case of a filmmaker indulging himself, or showing off, to the ultimate benefit of his audience.

I've still got that smile on my face!
10/10
ps, for such a small country there's a large variety of Irish accents, so we're usually able to narrow a native's origin down to his native county, and I'm pretty good at it; Orson's accent is from nowhere I've ever been!",1521072000,,2790,5.1208791208791204
