8198269,5,B000R17RS0,"3x3 Eyes is one of my favorite anime series. The story is engaging and the pacing is superb. I enjoy the characters and the evolution of the primary protagonists throughout the series. If you like old-school animation, you'll love the gritty art style and fluid movement of this series - no recycled or looping animations either!

The DVD transfer is less than perfect, with full-frame blending in some places, and one scene that somehow got overexposed. However, I don't feel this issues are significant enough to subtract a star - the blending is barely noticable when watching, and the overexposure is again only one scene. The image clarity isn't up to modern standards, but that's expected of an older series, and doesn't bother me in the slightest.",1347062400,2,754,4.937007874015748
