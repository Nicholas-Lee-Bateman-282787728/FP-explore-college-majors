Most disconcerting to me was its attitude towards women. At some points they might very well have just come out and said ""get back in the kitchen and make me a sammich! And make some babies too while you're at it, biatch!"" It was also somewhat... well I don't want to say ""anti-environment"" so much as apathetic towards the issue.""

It was ridiculous and I don't recommend it unless you want to waste your time, money, and any braincells you didn't already fry just looking at the stupid box art.",1267747200,9,737,4.849206349206349
3512287,5,B001CGD1P2,"This is an outstanding DVD about the population decline of the world and it's consequences - current and future - stemming from the growing unwillingness of people to have children.
  The film is chocked full of graphs, stats, and great quotes, and has a cool extra of being able to view one by one each graph shown in the film.
  People have become increasingly selfish and are having less children, by choice, to have more time to indulge themselves in their self-centered pursuits. The media and entertainment industries glamorize the idea of putting off things like getting married and starting a family, which at one time would've been considered part of growing up. But the chickens may be coming home to roost sooner than we thought. As the baby boomers pass into retirement age, a shrinking young work force will not be able to support them, causing people strapped for money to have even less children, and so making the problem worse.
  This story is one you'll never hear the media talk about, because unlike the myth of global warming, people returning to nuclear family structures and having more children does nothing to further their religion of humanism. After decades of hearing about the dangerous ""population explosion"" and ""global crowding"", finally another liberal myth is killed by facts and truth. They can bury global warming right next to them.",1261785600,13,1369,4.956331877729258

3512289,5,B001CGD1P2,"I highly recommend this documentary.  As the demographers interviewed mention, there is little quibble over the numbers.  Current birth rates are below the replacement levels in 70 countries now.  There is a great need for awareness of the truth on this issue.  Countries like Russia and Latvia are facing extinction, and it is on the forefront of their political minds.  However, in the US we are still blissfully unaware of our coming troubles.  As Adam Smith said, population growth leads to economic prosperity.  Population decline leads to depression.

As a side note, the demographers interviewed are not coming from a faith-based perspective in many cases.  Several mentioned that they are members of secular progressive organizations or have a Darwin/Malthus based approach to understanding human behavior.  This is why the fact that people are not reproducing is so surprising in light of the evolutionary theory that all life forms are driven to reproduce themselves to the limit of their resources.

The sequel to this documentary, Population Bomb, has also just been released.  I hope Amazon carries it as well.",1248998400,22,1123,5.247191011235955
3512290,1,B001CGD1P2,"The premise of this film is that people in the ""developed"" world are not having enough kids to replace themselves, and the population will both age and shrink.  Budgets will be strained, the economy will collapse, and we will all be royally f***ed as a result.  We may even go the way of the Romans as a worst case scenario.  Scared yet?

If so, relax.  Save your worrying for the real crises heading our way; this is the LEAST of our problems, if it even is a problem.  First of all, this movie is a huge denial of the world's overpopulation problem.  The UN predicts that, if the world's total fertility rate drops to 1.85 children per woman (replacement is about 2.1 for developed countries, 2.4 otherwise) as predicted, the world's population will peak at around 9 billion, then gently decline afterward.  But if the fertility rate stays as is, at 2.6, we will keep growing, and surpass 12 billion by 2050, and even reach the trillions by 2300.  Obviously, such growth is ridiculously unsustainable, and even the current size of 6.7 billion is well above the world's carrying capacity according to several scientists.  Cornell scientist Dr. David Pimentel (the anti-ethanol guy) and others argue that the world's carrying capacity can handle at most 2-3 billion in the long term at a fairly decent standard of living, or 1 billion if everyone lived like us wasteful Americans.  The optimum size for the USA is 150-200 million, like it was in 1950.  Peak oil, global warming, deforestation, soil erosion, pollution, food shortages, disease--you name it, overpopulation will make it WORSE.  And every cause will become a lost cause with runaway population growth.

So why are the makers of this film panicking about declining population?  Well, the fertility rates dropped below replacement a few decades ago in all developed countries, and stayed there for most of them.  EU average is 1.5, Japan is 1.2, Russia is 1.4, Canada is 1.6, Australia is 1.8.  So those countries will likely shrink, and more quickly in the lowest fertility countries.  For example if the fertility rate stayed at 1.8, the population will, after slowing down and peaking, drop at a rate of about 10% each generation.  At 1.5, it would be a 25% drop, at 1.0 it would be about 50%, and so on.

But America is 2.1, right at replacement, despite falling to 1.7-1.8 in the 1970s, and due to massive immigration we will keep growing from the current 308 million to 450 million by 2050.  We will both age and grow.  And while most of the Third World has had declining fertility, it is still well above replacement.  In fact, Africa still has fertility rates of 5+ in several countries.  And that is part of the reason (not the only reason of course) they are stuck in the vicious cycle of severe poverty.

The reasons the film gives for people having fewer kids are all the usual suspects.  People are less likely to get married and more likely to have sex outside of marriage.  Throw modern, effective birth control and legalized abortion into the mix, and you have a society that is not very conducive to people having the kind of huge families of the past.  In other words, the decline of the patriarchal nuclear family is the cause.

I also can't help but notice the slight racial tinge to the fears--since only the developed world will decline in population, one must wonder if the real fear is that the we are not having the ""right kind"" of babies?  After all, the rest of the world will be growing for the foreseeable future.

People in several countries are panicking and governments are actually paying people to have kids.  The fear is that pension systems (like Social Security) will fail and healthcare systems will be strained, and the economy will decline. These first two fears are true but greatly exaggerated and the latter point is unfounded, and completely overlooks the benefits of moderate population decline.  Russia, Japan, and Germany both grew economically and shrank demographically at the same time in the early and mid 2000s, until they joined the rest of the world in recession.  While the potential for GDP growth will be reduced by a shrinking population, GDP can still grow if productivity per worker (caused by technological growth) continues at its current rate. Efficiency may even increase with a smaller population.  And even if GDP declines, GDP per capita (more important) will most likely increase, as long as the population shrinks faster than the economy.  Pyramid scheme pensions (that's what they really are) can be reformed, and so can healthcare.  Taxes need not rise as much as predicted to pay for the old folks, if at all. Infrastructure, roads, parks, schools, hospitals, police, fire departments--remember that all these things cost more the bigger a population is. Even population aging has some benefits--reduced crime, reduced violence, fewer crazy radicals.

The ecological benefits of a shrinking population cannot be overstated.  And it is GOOD that the developed world will shrink in population first and fastest, since they have the greatest impact due to their gargantuan consumption patterns (too bad America is not shrinking as well).  This is progress, people!  Yes, per capita consumption needs to go down as well, If we cut our consumption in half, but allow the population to double, we've made zero progress despite a reduced standard of living.  The film cannot even acknowledge this; rather they say make the specious claim that strained budgets due to fewer taxpayers and more old folks (which are not mutually exclusive groups mind you) will make it harder for governments to pay for environmental programs.  Hey, an ecotax (carbon tax or green tax shift) can kill BOTH birds with one stone, so there. OK, but hasn't the number of households increased faster than the population due to the decline of the patriarchal nuclear family as the film claims, leading to worse environmental impact?  Ah, but the same trend leads to fewer people, and the number of households will eventually peak and decline as well even in the extreme case of every household having only one person, so in the long run the net effect is impact REDUCTION, not worsening.  The film claims the most eco-friendly family is the patriarchal nuclear family.  Not true.  I suppose a household size of say, 100, like the Iroquois had, would be even better.  And they were anything but nuclear families!

And what if the economy did stop growing?  Would that really be the end of the world?  We NEED to end out addiction to growth for the sake of growth. We cannot keep growing forever, even economically.  Resources are finite.  Growth once used to be a means to an end, now it has become an end in itself.  And with a stable or declining population, economic growth will no longer be necessary, and we could have a steady-state economy with no inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment, and reduced resouce consumption.

Another reason to take a chill pill when watching the film.  Many low-fertilty countries are gradually rebounding from their sub-replacement nadirs--New Zealand is now at replacement at 2.1, and several European countries are now just slightly above replacement.  One theory is that up to a certain point, increasing gender equality reduces fertility, but beyond that point actually increases it. That makes sense that when women become as rich as or richer than men, having kids becomes less of a burden.  Most of the countries with increasing fertility are in northern Europe, with the greatest gender equality overall.  While the countries stuck with fertility rates below 1.5 (Spain, Italy, Greece, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong) tend to have more traditional gender roles despite modernization.  And America is....well, exceptional.

Listen, I got news for you--had the kind of familism of the 1950s persisted to this day, with a fertility rate around 4 or so, there would be DOUBLE the number of Gen X and Millennials.  The world would be MUCH more crowded, and peak oil probably would have occurred in 1990 or earlier.  The earth would be a lot hotter as well, and even more species would have gone extinct.  It looks like the grass is always greener on the other side.

So if you watch it, make it a double feature with Soylent Green.  But take it all with a grain of salt, and save your worrying for the real crises--overpopulation, global warming, environmental degradation.",1239408000,27,8449,4.904225352112676

3512292,5,B001CGD1P2,"DVD: Demographic Winter

 The premise of this documentary is that population in the civilized world is in decline. Population is expanding because were getting older (not dying) not because of births. This of course is going to bite us on our rear end. Why? Here are some points the documentary to illustrate this:

1. Japans economy fell as their population aged. The older people retired and didn't spend as much. Consumer spending drives an economy.

2. Europe is having serious population depletion right now. There are countries giving out subsidies to encourage people to breed. It's a huge problem.

3. Russia's population is declining by 700,000 a year and they too are encouraging people to breed.

4. The least populated areas of the world are the ones that are some of the least environmentally friendly.

5. The world economy will be drastically impacted by western population decline. Where China and other countries will be impacted at first they will have the population to recover. We won't.

6. The baby boomers are going to retire soon. Then you will have more people collecting benefits like social security and medicare then supporting it (a reverse pyramid). This will crush our economy... So you can look forward to: 1. Increase of age limits to retire, 2. increase taxes on those still working, 3. a decrease in benefits...

7. One of the biggest problems is the destruction of the family. Our children are being raised in broken homes. I can't begin to do this part of the movie justice. You really have to see it to appreciate it. In the end this is about the world we are leaving our children. Many movements (environmental, exc.) have stated increasing population as one of the evils of the world (and against their movement). This documentary (if looked at honestly) will challenge many of these assumptions and force them to come up with a more honest platform. It's not that some of these issues are not real; it's just that the resources are being misused to blame things that are in truth NOT THE PROBLEM... Without young people new technology won't be made, new ideas won't be as plentifull. These are serious issues one should take a look at. Please watch this documentary. You may not agree with them but it will challenge some of your beliefs.

Lastly, do watch all the way through the ending credits. There's a little something at the end.",1231372800,50,2376,4.815724815724816

8287613,5,B001CGD1P2,"I looked forward to this video which supported my concerns for the ill process of calculations created around the 2050 population count, which is tainted by a lack of calculating declining demographics, which are occuring in almost every culture and nation. It is about time something was offered that covered the other side of the story. I would not have as much trouble with the videos they show in school that scare the kids into never wanting children if they turned around and showed this video helping kids understand what has begun to happen because people have stopped having kids, but that wouldn't fit the political agenda and it would derail too many indoctrinated belief systems so it will never happen.",1335571200,9,715,4.917355371900826
8287614,4,B001CGD1P2,"This 58 minute video is about the worldwide decline of the human family.  It is a documentary that uses interviews from a variety of economists, demographers, sociologists, psychologists and political figures.  They all agree that there are some rather chilling dangers facing society and the world's economies based on the fact that most countries in the world are failing to reproduce at a replacement rate.  They account for the result by pointing to decades of abortion, homosexuality, feminism, high rates of divorce, people living together outside of marriage and bad government policy.  And, interestingly, they didn't interview Christians for this documentary.",1309996800,6,668,5.584158415841584
8287615,1,B001CGD1P2,"Anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of exponential mathematical functions and common sense would understand that this ""documentary"" has but a miniscule basis in fact. Although economic growth has been dependent on population growth thus far, this is clearly not a sustainable model, not for individuals, not for the environment, and certainly not for any country. If the filmmakers are worried about the economy, I would direct them to countries such as India, which has less than a third of the US' land area, but well over three times its population.

The enduring racism that was present in Demographic Winter is also present here. What they are really seeking is an increase in the Caucasian population (hardly surprising given the ethnicity of the largely vapid and hollow talking heads in this ""documentary""). Will they change their tune when the inevitable population crash happens?

In this and its prequel, Demographic Winter, the wingnuts and pundits decry governmental coercion to reduce ballooning populations. What they fail to realise (or more likely, simply refuse to see) is that we do not really have a choice, as a species. Either we reduce the population of our own accord, or nature will do it for us, through famine. I know which method I would prefer to see occur.

The film is chock full of lies and propaganda, mostly concerning Charles Darwin, evolution, Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger. They assert that responsible family planning will doom us all. As one might expect, they consistently ignore and downplay the suffering caused by large families and unfit parents. Anyone ever read Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)? Roe vs Wade was the single greatest contributor to a precipitous decline in crime rates in the late 80s and early-to-mid 90s.

I'm glad they did not mention the mendacious and specious ""argument"" about being about to fit the world's population in the state of Texas. That's not the issue here. That's not what environmentally responsible individuals are arguing. We simply cannot sustain the current world population ad infinitum; something must give. Either we find a way to stop breeding like rabbits, or we run out of food. I shouldn't have to mention the obvious consequences of famine, war and cannibalism that will inevitably result if we take the former route. I suggest we castrate the entirety of the Quiverfuls and the Duggar Swarm at once.

The filmmakers and misinformed talking heads attempt to disprove Malthus' hypothesis about growing populations and growing food supplies. What they ignored (or blatantly refused) to mention is how technology played the most important role in feeding the world. And even still, millions are dying every year from inadequate nutrition. These people clearly are not interested in presenting fair, balanced and accurate scientific research.

Reducing the population will increase the average share of resources that each individual human (and animal) will have available to use, and will therefore benefit all of us. It really is that simple. We must stop being ""fruitful"" or we will go extinct.",1304121600,2,3141,5.1976284584980235

I think if an institution or educator wanted to give students the opportunity to hear a different side of the debate, this would be a great resource.  Another place for information along the same lines is overpopulationisamyth.com and their parent company Population Research Institute.

8287618,3,B001CGD1P2,"I just finished watching this DVD and will be watching the sequel tomorrow night. I think I am a fairly astute viewer and I could not detect any glaring errors, so will take at face value the bones of the argument as presented by the demographers who are featured in the film. From what I can discover in 20 minutes of Googleing, the numbers are more or less accurate. There will be less young people in the future in developed countries and there will be more seniors, and this disparity will have effects on the economy and the direction of the species. Japan and Spain and Latvia are showing us what we in North America can expect in the coming few years and it doesn't tend to foster optimism.

Where I take some issue is with the interpretation of the data and the idea that seems to shine through the careful control exercised by the film maker, namely that free thinking urban westerners will ultimately succumb to the masses of religion-loving rural folk who are out-breeding the eggheads.

Things are never that simple. It may be counter-evolutionary that the brightest and most powerful are having few children while poor single-parent families are having large numbers of children, but predicting what that will mean in the long run is highly problematic because there are so many factors in this fluid ""wired"" world where innovation and change benefit from massive inter-connectivity and synergistic collaboration. Take for example TED or Avaaz or any other web energized social change agency. There is no way to know if robots, algae farms, or the failure of antibiotics will completely alter the destiny of human kind.

But back to the problem with this film. A good documentary should give both sides of an issue, present a panel of experts with a varied of views and the logic behind each argument. No attempt is made in this film to present any alternative interpretations, the viewer is left wondering if, miracle of miracle,just possibly, for the first time in history, an academic department is unanimous in their conclusions, across institutions and countries. ""Demographers of the world unite and predict the decline of the human race unless we return to family values and religion."" Really?

So at this point, I have to say I am having trouble trusting the conclusions reached by the film makers. I feel disappointed that such films fall so short of journalistic ideals, and sad that I don't have better options out there to watch.

I think this issue of loss of trust and frustration at our inability to get to the real truth of a matter, is much more scary than the decline in birth rates. My only hope is that the second part presents a more balanced perspective. If not, then I will have to consider this a piece of propaganda.",1291334400,11,2754,4.765199161425577
