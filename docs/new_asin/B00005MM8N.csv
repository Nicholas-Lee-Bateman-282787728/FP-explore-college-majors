1627085,3,B00005MM8N,"Barney's Let's Go to the Zoo was filled with many fun songs for the little ones.  My daughter did not enjoy this video as much as many of the others because only Barney, Baby Bop and B.J. were shown.  The gang was not there and this aspect of the video was very disappointing.  I feel when the kids are included in the video it becomes more entertaining.  The setting of the video was in a zoo and all of the animals were real and I liked this aspect of the video.  It lets a child get an understanding of the set up of a zoo, and it would be great to show any child before taking them to a zoo for the first time.  Overall, I would think about chosing another video for your child's collection if you only want to include one Barney video.",1008201600,3,740,4.068965517241379
1627086,5,B00005MM8N,"This tape is excellent! It took my baby several viewing to like it, but once she did, she really liked it! Barney, B.J. and Baby Bop go to the zoo and see many animals like Elephants, Lions, Tigers, Parrots, Tortises, Kangaroos, Hippos, Merkats and Bears. The songs are very good! Half are new and half are the same ones. I particarly like the Elephant and Tiger songs a lot. My baby loves The Wiggles and only one other Barney video, Sing And Dance With Barney. After several viewing of this tape she fell in love with it. Now she giggles at B.J. and Baby Bops anitics, as well as the puppet squirel guy. It is bright and colorful and fun to watch. Just like being at the zoo right along with them!
A very good tape and a must have for a active child who won't sit still for most tapes on the market!",1003276800,20,801,4.207792207792208
1627087,5,B00005MM8N,"My 16 month old granddaughter loves Barney but the only Barney video she would watch was ""Sing and Dance with Barney"".  We bought other Barney videos that she wouldn't give the time of day to.  When we bought ""Let's Go to the Zoo"", we figured she wouldn't watch it either but we wanted to give it a try since she loves animals.  She absolutely loves it and we watch it many, many times a day.  You get to see so many different animals close up.  I know all the words to all the songs.  There is just something about Barney, Baby Bob and BJ with all of those wonderful animals. If you are not able to get to the Fort Worth Zoo, you can see it all on video.  Simply magnificant and highly recommended.  I think I'll buy another in the event she wears this one out.",1002585600,15,762,4.136054421768708

1627156,1,B00005MM8N,"I bought this for my 19 month old Grandson. His Mom grew up on Barney and I wanted to introduce her son to the wonder of Barney. I was expecting a regular episode (or collection of episodes) of the Barney program on TV. It did not have any of the classic Barney songs I remember from the show. There was no group of kids like I remembered. It was just Barney, BJ and Baby Bop walking around a zoo. Worst of all there are way too many previews of other videos at the beginning and no way to skip them!! The best part of this DVD was the preview of Barney Songs from the park. My Grandson actually enjoyed that so I guess I will try purchasing that one. I love Barney and especially voiced by Bob West so I will try another video. Also my DVD skipped so I'm sending it back.",1474675200,,772,4.052287581699346

The only type of shows she will actually pay attention to are Barney and any shows containing animals, so this one is a win win! Its funny too that my niece is also obsessed with Barney and won't watch anything else, she is a couple months older than my daughter. I highly reccomend these shows to any young toddlers or children, as they are also very informative, educational, as well as teaches them to use their imaginations, which I think is extremely important this day and age with the take over of technology. Its fun for the little ones because it has lots of singing and dancing as well as colorful scenes and the topics are always fun for them. This one especially being a trip to the zoo. Barney is also great for teaching them how to share, have manners and many other important things all children need to learn. We LOVE Barney in our home.",1461888000,,958,4.543352601156069

All I can convey is that my twin 2 year olds cannot get enough of this video- It is their favorite Barney by far and has been the biggest hit in our collection- so much for Elmo. They dance to to the many songs, shout the names of the animals and chant ""Barney Zoo!"" whenever i get close to the DVD player. Nuff said.",1350864000,,436,4.329268292682927

They love Barney's lively chatter, friends and songs and this DVD does not disappoint in that area. I would have given this DVD five stars for that.  However, to get to the actual Barney story, every time you start the DVD you have to go through the previews.  It drives the kids (and me) crazy.  I tend to avoid this DVD for that reason.  We have to go through all the Hit Entertainment groups--Kipper, the Wiggles (which scares one of my sons  because he for some reason does not like the Wiggles and asks for them to be turned off), Angelina, and more Barney etc.--over and over.  I actually like some of these other groups but I did not buy the DVD to watch a preview of them every time.  The other Barney DVDs we have list options to see the previews, which we enjoy at an appropriate time.  If this Barney DVD were based on story, I would give 5 stars.  But laid out the way it is, I give 3 stars (maybe even less).  Sorry Barney.",1253491200,,1023,4.168367346938775
1627826,5,B00005MM8N,"In this video, Barney, BJ and Baby Bop spend a day at the Zoo where Scooter McNutty and Ms. Kepler (the science teacher from school) join them.  Typical Barney fun ensues with jokes and songs and lots of animal pals.

Some of the animals featured:
Flamingos, meerkats, giraffes, tortoise, tigers, lions, porcupines, chimps, apes, monkeys and gorillas, hippos, parrots, zebras, warthog, elephants, barn owl,  bear, kangaroo, koala, among others I might have missed :)

The real strength of this video is that there are lots of opportunities for kids to learn about animals.  Among other things Barney discusses how different animals prefer different environments: food and activities, for example.  Hippos, he points out, like the water and kids learn that hippos' noses are high on their heads to allow them to stay mostly submerged while they breathe.

The photography is very good and the music catchy.  A great Barney addition!!!

My kids got this one from Grandma around the time my youngest was born.  Although the other Barney DVDs that have found there way into our house have been quietly re-routed to other places, I find this one much less irritating than the other Barney episodes that have been borrowed from the library.  Since the video wasn't designed for parents, it's best recommendation is that after more than two years, my kids still watch it at least once every few weeks (about as often as I offer it).

There's some information on the animals, including some views that only very lucky zoo-goers ever get to see.  Other than that, there's lots of the singing and dancing characteristic of Barney.  It's a hit with my kids.",1133049600,6,831,4.543624161073826

1627863,5,B00005MM8N,"My 2- and 4-year-old girls love this show!!  Barney, BJ, Baby Bop, and a stowaway, Scooter, take a trip to the fabulous Fort Worth Zoo.  As they sing and dance their way around the zoo, they see many different animals and learn a little bit about each one.  Interspersed throughout the video are short animal spotlights by BJ.  Also, as the gang visits each exhibit, they ask viewers things like, ""Can you hop like a kangaroo?""  ""Can you roar like a lion?"" and it shows children doing the things Barney asks them to do.  Songs such as ""What'll We See At the Zoo?"", ""Jungle Adventure,"" ""Elephant,"" ""Everybody Needs A Nap,"" and a song about snacking on fruits and vegetables are included.  This video is interactive and fun, and the short facts given about the animals are very easy to understand (did you know a koala has two thumbs on each hand for climbing?!).  It doesn't go into great detail about each animal, but it is a great introduction to help the child want to learn more.  I also like seeing all the families spending a fun day at the zoo together.  To top it off, the filming and graphics are top-notch!  I highly recommend this video for all zoo-lovers and zoo-lovers-to-be!",1050451200,7,1187,4.578199052132701

The songs are very catchy, and I often find myself singing along or them playing in my head during the day!  They are simple but instructive songs such as ""Everybody Needs A Nap"", ""Have A Snack"", ""Growing"" and the wonderful song and dance intro ""Lets Go to the Zoo"".  The choreography is perfect.  Even though this is for kids, Barney, BJ and Baby Bop's tour of the zoo and their description of each animal is very interesting as well as adorable.
