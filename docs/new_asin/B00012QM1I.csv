8005647,5,B00012QM1I,This is the best Yoga compilation I've ever seen.,1440460800,,49,4.555555555555555
8005648,4,B00012QM1I,"I have always liked this 2 disc series and have recommended it to many of my therapy clients. I like the segments, and it is easy to create a full-class routine by using bits and pieces from the menu of different styles and levels. I like the instructors and the setting. I think that it is better than several other yoga DVD's I have previewed.",1241395200,,345,4.323076923076923
8005649,2,B00012QM1I,"This 2-disc DVD set is great for those beginning a yoga regime into their lives. Great way to introduce the viewer into strength through posture, balance, and stretching. Though, cues for poses are miscued (calling child's pose ""frog"" etc) if you are learning these cues and go to an actual yoga studio, you will be completely lost. Luckily I came to these DVD's with some previous experience, so I was able to recognize these issues. The 2nd DVD is the more advanced of the 2, with a ""yoga dance"" at the end that is more like aerobics and fun to do- but no instruction is involved, its more of a ""just do it"" kind of thing.
All in all, best for beginners who can integrate this series with studio work.",1218844800,,703,4.415384615384616
8005650,3,B00012QM1I,"I got this DVD set for about $9 at a school book sale, and it's really a great addition to my yoga and pilates video library.  I'm not a hardcore yoga fan, but I like using the exercises to stretch and relax, and improve my flexibility.  I lead a busy life, and the segments on this DVD are a really good, quick way to put yoga into my daily schedule.  I know that there are elements that are missing (mostly breathing and meditation exercises), but I find the pacing of what is offered to be at my level.",1215388800,,505,4.13265306122449
8005651,3,B00012QM1I,"I just purchased this 2 dvd set because of the incredibly low price (school book sale).  I am somewhat of an intermediate practitioner and find that the cues are sometimes not accurate, the names of the poses aren't often correct, the video quality is so-so, and as one of the other reviewers wrote, there are many choppy sequences which results in the lack of a full ""class"" of yoga postures. A series of yoga poses should ALWAYS include breathing at the beginning and end, as well as an ending relaxation. The dance section is fun though, and if you already know your body and how to properly do these poses, it can be a decent supplement to your other dvds and classes.",1147910400,2,672,4.508196721311475
8005652,3,B00012QM1I,This DVD was chopped up into segments that didn't give you the length of the programs. If you decide to do a few of each section then you would have to stop the program and forward to the next. I would have preferred a Hatha yoga workout with relaxation and meditation at the end. The relaxation tends to be skipped on most dvd's as the do not feature the body scan which is the most important part of the relaxation exercise. I like a dvd that flows like a class..with a beginning and a definate end.,1131408000,2,501,4.229166666666667
8005653,4,B00012QM1I,"This DVD had everything I was looking for: an introduction to some of the basic yoga postures (such as the tree and downward dog), as well as a great stretching workout for the whole body. The wonderful British accents of the instructors are terrific for relaxation--another big plus. Although the editing is a little sloppy (it's obvious that some segments were spliced in from other videos), it can be overlooked in light of the overall package. This two-disc DVD is probably not for the hardcore yoga enthusiast, but perfect for the newbie. Because it provides such a wonderful balance to my cardio and weight-training regimen--and because it feels so darned good--I actually look forward to popping it in the DVD player.",1129766400,4,724,4.991735537190083
