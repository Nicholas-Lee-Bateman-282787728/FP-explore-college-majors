7934776,1,B00005A085,This is a mini CD and won't play in a computer. I would have gladly paid more as the actual video is excellent for teaching children about the families of the orchestra.,1490659200,,169,4.3125
7934777,2,B00005A085,This was advertised as a DVD. In fact it is a mini DVD and should be advertised as such.,1434672000,,88,3.6842105263157894

7934780,1,B00005A085,"This is a mini-disc and does not work in many computers. You need to have a device that loads with a tray. Most computers these days do not have that any longer. I bought this because it was advertised as a DVD. I was hoping to replace my old VHS. I don't want to use the TV in my room, I wanted to use my computer as the player. Most new technologies do not use a tray any more. THIS SHOULD BE STATED IN THE LISTING.",1306281600,,417,3.86046511627907
7934781,1,B00005A085,"Mini-dvds do not work in all computers--you should advertise that this is mini-dvd format, not full-size dvd!",1191456000,,109,5.470588235294118
7934782,5,B00005A085,"i think the dude is funny.  it's good idea to compare music making with cooking.  my 1 yr old loves it, although she may not really understand the content.",1144454400,,155,4.310344827586207
7934783,3,B00005A085,"As a music teacher, I liked this video because it ties in elements that students already understand, with the concept of putting instruments together in families and in the orchestra.  It's not the best video I have ever seen, but my 2nd graders enjoyed it.",1142985600,3,257,4.711111111111111
7934784,2,B00005A085,"This video would have been fine, as it was actually quite informative, if it wasn't for the goofy and irritating narrator.  The surfer language and ""Bill and Ted"" impression got old really fast.  And I am not sure what the cake baking stuff had to do with musical instruments.  It is because of him that I will NOT be purchasing the other videos.
I showed it to my music classes and every child thought the narration was stupid.  They did learn key things about instrument families etc. but found the narrator a turn off.",1063238400,,521,4.51063829787234
7934785,1,B00005A085,"I had hoped for a basic introduction to musical instruments for my two children (ages 8 & 10), but they and I both thought the video was practically worthless.  P.J., the chef/main character is too silly (much like the main characters in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) and wastes far too much time trying to be funny.  There is very little on the instruments themselves.  In fact, you are not given much of an opportunity to even hear what they sound like.  The major families of instruments were introduced, but the information was overshadowed by P.J.'s efforts to be funny.  My family did not find him the least bit amusing and we decided to send this tape right off to the consignment shop.",994291200,15,697,4.634146341463414
