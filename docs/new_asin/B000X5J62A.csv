8226930,2,B000X5J62A,"This is a great drama, but the subtitles suck grapefruit.  The first six or so episodes were almost tolerable, but I had to watch the rest on Dramafever because the translations were so crazy and poorly written that I couldn't tell what was going on.  It was very frustrating.",1361577600,,276,4.612244897959184
