8232000,3,B000YDKAK8,"""Sea Raiders"" was the last serial released by Universal in 1941, in 12 chapters with the Dead End Kids, resembling their serial of the previous year, ""Junior G-Men.""  Directed by Ford Beebe and John Rawlins, this time the gang is a bunch of ""wharf rats"" led by Billy Adams (Billy  Halop) with Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell and Bernard Punsly as Toby Nelson, Bilge and Butch.  The plot involves the sinking of ships bound for Europe with war munitions, and the boys, in their running battle with harbor cop Brack Warren (William Hall), encounter the Raider's agents, who steal a torpedo boat designed for the government by Billy's older brother Tom (John McGuire).  Suspected of the crime, the boys have to recover the boat, unmask the Sea Raider, and eventually deal with the real brains behind the operation.

After ""Riders of Death Valley,"" Universal's ""million dollar"" serial, it would appear that their next effort, ""Sea Raiders"" had to make do on the small amount left in their budget.  It is pre-war propaganda, with a plot something like Republic's ""King of the Royal Mounted"" and a comparison of the two clearly shows why Republic's serials were superior.  But ""Sea Raiders"" is not without interest, and the antics of the Dead End Kids are a little more spirited than in their previous serial.  Unfortunatley the low budget shows, the special effects about as bad as they got at Universal, with a model torpedo boat passing through large doors in the hull of a ""fishing barge"" which presumably remains afloat through suspension of disbelief.  The same scratchy stock footage of a ship being blown up is seen at the ends of the first and fourth chapters, and a couple cliffhangers are recycled from earlier serials.  But at least there is a plot, and if padded out in the later chapters it is more compelling than those of Universal's other serials from 1941.  The musical score has been ridiculed in a few reviews, and the Rossini overtures don't really work well as the bombs approach the doomed ships, but Mendelssohn's ""Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage"" overture has the right atmosphere, if the mix with Universal's usual ""stock music"" is sometimes a little jarring.

As for the cast, Reed Hadley, as ""foreign"" agent Carl Tonjes isn't very convincing; a better villain is Stanley Blystone as Captain Olaf Nelson, Toby Nelson's no-good uncle and operator of the mysteriously still-floating barge.  There are two female characters, Aggie Nelson (Mary Field), Toby's sister, and Leah Carlton (Marcia Ralston), girlfriend of Tom Adams and daughter of the financial backer of Tom's torpedo boat, Elliott Carlton (Edward Keane).  The cast is fairly large, and includes some familiar faces from ""B"" movies and serials, including Ernie Adams, John Merton, Richard Alexander, James Blaine, Jack Mulhall, Duke York, House Peters, Jr. and Forrest Taylor.

Alpha's edition is in two volumes, ALP 4309D and 4310D, or both as 9545D.  As is all too common with Universal's serials, existing copies seem to be mostly mediocre 16mm reduction prints made for television.  A mix of source prints was used with both Universal and Serials Incorporated copyrights on the main titles, the ones from Universal having motion in the background picture.  But the opening from Chapter Two, with MPPDA certificate number 7302, was spliced onto some of the later chapters, possibly to replace missing or damaged film.  Some patching was also done to include many of the original ""next week"" notices, a worthwhile effort since this is the only place where the chapter titles are shown.  Three of the chapters have these recreated by Serials Incorporated, without the graphics and punctuation of the originals.  None of this was done by Alpha; the same video source shows up in VCI's old VHS edition, and was probably a pre-existing ""public domain"" video master.  But the image is only a little unsharp, there isn't a lot of video noise and the framing is adequate.  Unfortunatley the gray scale leaves a lot to be desired.  Highlights don't wash out very often, but details get lost in the darker scenes.  The sound quality and volume level vary, and while not free of distortion and noise it isn't bad; the dialogue can usually be understood, and frequency range and balance are fairly decent.

As noted, VCI's old VHS edition, #1736 appears to be from the same video master, with the same splices and even a few video glitches, but the image isn't quite as sharp, at least on the copy I have, which also has some vertical jumps as if the head-switch point got confused with the vertical sync pulse during one of the transfers, a problem not seen on Alpha's DVD.

The serial was also released in four parts on VHS 'way back in the 1980's by United American Video, though I've only seen one of the tapes.  These were usually dubbed at EP speed, without Hi-Fi sound, and the chapters tend to lack the ""next week"" titles.  While the image isn't as sharp as VCI's, the gray scale is a little better.

The serial will be of interest to fans of the Dead End Kids, and to those who want to see what Universal's serials were like just prior to the War.  While far from Universal's best, the plot moves along, and doesn't seem too redundant when watched with some time between chapters.  Alpha's DVD isn't much improvement over the VHS versions, but while the print is murky it has no spectacular faults, it is fairly cheap, and was relased back when they didn't put their logo on-screen during the credits.",1369526400,6,5473,4.851612903225806
