8169321,5,B000MGUZGG,"Bought this as a gift for my mom. She says it brought back lots of memories of her teen years. She remembers watching it in a theater in Havana, Cuba. She loved it.

As for me. Movie is kinda cheesy but if you like old romances and julio Iglesias it probably doesn't get much better than this.",1225584000,,293,4.140350877192983
8169322,5,B000MGUZGG,"I love this movie ! This movie is from the 1960's..  very old.. i wish they would digitize it ! if you like European movies than you should get this movie ,I am from Galicia-Spain living in Canada so its one of the reasons  i bought this movie and i am also a  fan of Julio Iglesias . This movie is very Nostalgic and i got a good feeling watching it ! it brings you back to a time capsule an era of the 1960's thats gone forever .  ps. long live Julio Iglesias ! God gave him a voice like an angel !",1210723200,2,500,3.7788461538461537
8169323,3,B000MGUZGG,"En verdad es una bonita, dramatica, romantica y tierna historia que hubiera haber sido digitalizada y masterizada,por haber salido en DVD. desafortunadamente no fue asi, y no podia verse bien en una television de alta definicion. tuve que verla en una television convencional, con sonido mono y tratando de enfocar colores y matizes para lograr un mejor colorido.

Espero que en el futuro todas estas peliculas,buenas puedan mejorarse con la nueva tecnologia y asi puedan verse como nuevas.",1177804800,4,490,5.282051282051282
8169324,5,B000MGUZGG,"Great movie because of the music that made Julio famous. After being a socket player and a terrible accident that put him on a wheel chair with no hope on recovery, we can see in the movie his gradual recuperation, his life changing from an sportman to a singer, a love story, the music from ""Yo canto"" CD that includes songs like ""La vida sigue igual"", ""Chiquilla"", ""Tenia una guitarra"", ""Yo canto"", etc.

A collectible for Julio's fans. One of the greatest romantic singers in the all world. No question about it.",1177200000,5,515,4.5978260869565215
