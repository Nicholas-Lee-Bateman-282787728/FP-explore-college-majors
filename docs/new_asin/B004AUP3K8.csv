8420981,5,B004AUP3K8,This is a classic.  Highly recommended and gripping,1454544000,,51,5.375
8420982,3,B004AUP3K8,"I like Jean Reno, and I liked the trailer to this movie, but I didn't really like the movie.  It's not the movie though, it's me.

I'm used to watching Jean Reno in Luc Besson movies.  Those movies are a little weird and quirky.  This movie was not weird or quirky.  It's more of a serious movie about violent gangster revenge.  It's similarity to The Professional is casual at best.

But it is a solid movie with a believable plot, believable acting, believable special effects, etc.",1448841600,,484,4.558139534883721

8420984,3,B004AUP3K8,"I love Jean Reno, but this movie for me was to dark to follow well. By dark I mean the picture itself was on the dark side (some the scenes that should have been daylight looked to be nighttime.",1421712000,,194,4.0
8420985,3,B004AUP3K8,"Maybe nothing beats The Professional, certainly not this. Jean Reno is an amazing actor and the film has moments, but some of the stuff is just plain silly and the director expects way too much suspension of disbelief. Way too often 22 Bullets is disjointed. I don't know, just might have to go back and re-watch The Professional for the fourth time...if I want to see a great action flick and the best from Luc Besson and the great Jean Reno, action star like no other.",1398297600,,470,4.476744186046512
8420986,5,B004AUP3K8,"only drawback is in French and subtitles

8420987,5,B004AUP3K8,This is one great movie i didn't even mind the subtitals like a french godfather. So enjoy well worth it.even my wife liked it and my 18 year old.,1352073600,2,146,4.068965517241379
8420988,5,B004AUP3K8,Im just a sucker for Jean Reno I guess but this movie is excellent & so worth it too! Jean Reno is GREAT as usual-he can make an ok movie worth watching! The only down fall of this movie is spoken in french but at least theres english subtitles to go with it! This movie is along the line of (Leon)The Professional-also with Jean Reno! If you loved the Professional than youll love this movie!,1331596800,7,393,4.253333333333333
