8258570,4,B0015HZA5M,"not a fabulous movie, but good.  the plot is quite convoluted, and this doesn't really allow any character development beyond revealing the wheels turning inside the story.  i'm didn't catch all of the details, because some things didn't make sense, but a good movie",1515542400,,266,5.0227272727272725
8258571,3,B0015HZA5M,I like that the picture was 16:9. I like the story. This was a very big mystery. This movie deviates from what I usually watch. That is good; I will let Amazon Prime make recommendations that bring me into a strange realm.,1507161600,,222,4.309523809523809
8258572,2,B0015HZA5M,Quite bad acting... And it is just a reenactment of an old time classic from Oscar Wilde. Pretty disappointing !,1504569600,2,112,4.65

8258574,2,B0015HZA5M,It's not the story that's bad. It's not the dialogue that's bad. It's the acting! These actors are ALL so bad that that there was not one authentic believable scene in the whole film. My advice is to just skip it.,1502496000,3,213,4.219512195121951

8258577,5,B0015HZA5M,"I found Just Business to be a very interesting film. I liked the plot, it was not convoluted or slow moving. The acting was very good. Of course,I consider Gina Gershon the best looking and by far the most talented actress out there. Gina couldn""t give a bad performance if she tried. Gina ""lights up"" every film  she makes. I recommend ""Just Business"".",1324080000,3,353,4.603174603174603

In modern times( starting in New York) he has been sixty years the behind the scenes king.
There are flashbacks to WW II and New York with a Chinese crime lord.
A old time professional burglar comes out of retirement to do the 'David' Gray house.
What he doesn't realize is that Gray is desperate to get his painting back,and willing to do what it takes to get it back: kidnapping and
torture included.
The movie seems to be a very clever blending of old and new
without seems to do major harm to either?
Tattoos and the occult enter into it...and a wicked twist.",1215129600,9,948,5.7304964539007095
