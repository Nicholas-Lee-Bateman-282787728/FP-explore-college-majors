7607644,4,B01AP0ASCO,Love the films of Whit Stillman and it's nice to have his first three films available on blu-ray each with extras on the discs. I'm going to confine this review to the box set itself and not review each movie. If you already own the other films on blu-ray there is nothing new in this set. The only thing you'll be missing is the box holding the three cases. For the price of all three movies the box set is better than buying each one individually. As of this writing it's like buying two discs and getting the third free.,1462320000,13,523,4.24

8747968,5,B01AP0ASCO,The first thing that should be said about Mr. Stillman is that he is very f###ing funny. I mean laugh out loud funny. The dialogue sparkles from beginning to end in each of the three pictures. Disco!,1486252800,,199,4.405405405405405
8747969,5,B01AP0ASCO,Waited a long time to upgrade from my laserdiscs. Whit Stillman's trio are easy to get lost inside if you have a free night. I want to join the Sally Fowler Rat Pack. The Chris Eigeman ought to get more credit for his character work in all three films. He's an indie icon from these three films. bonus feature of Whit on Charlie Rose puts his life in context.,1483747200,2,359,4.217391304347826

8747974,5,B01AP0ASCO,"Whit Stillman is one of the under-seen directors of the indie scene, whose footprint can be seen in directors even today, and Criterion here provide a great primer for the director, providing the first three director's films all in one package. Though some of the special features are lacking on a few of the discs, overall its a great experience, with fantastic video and audio quality. For those who have never seen Stillman's work, this is a great, somewhat inexpensive way to explore his oeuvre. For Stillman fans, this is great tribute to the director, and the best way to see his work (outside of seeing on the big screen).",1464566400,8,629,4.7272727272727275
