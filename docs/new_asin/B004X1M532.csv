4490994,5,B004X1M532,"I gave this show a chance because of Victoria Justice and the show creator, Dan Schneider. Actually this show is really good it reminds me of the old Nickelodeon. ""Victorious"" and ""True Jackson, VP"" are the only good live-action shows on Nickelodeon right now. I prefer the old Nickelodeon but specially the 90's Nickelodeon. The negative thing is that it's not in widescreen it's in non-anamorphic widescreen full frame. One positive thing is that you get a Digital Copy code so you can see all 10 episode wherever you are. Has 2 music videos and 2 short clips, wished it had more long bonus features. Nickelodeon really needs to release Complete Season Box Sets/Widescreen for their shows and needs to stop releasing Volume Sets/non-anamorphic widescreen full frame. Anyways great show.",1310256000,,788,5.069230769230769
4490995,5,B004X1M532,"I bought this DVD because I love the show. While I have enjoyed the DVD, I am very confused as to why they put the episodes completely out of order. The first three episodes are in order, but then it jumps to the middle of the season, then back towards the beginning of the season, and that's on disc one. On disc two, it starts towards the beginning of the season, but again out of order, then it jumps to the next to last episode of the season, then back to the middle of the season. Why was it put together this way? If Nick is going to release these TV shows on DVD, they should put all of the episodes in order because it is very confusing to the viewers and fans. Here is the complete list of season one episodes in order, even though they haven't released Volume Two yet.

1. Pilot (Special Extended Version)
2. The Bird Scene
3. Stage Fighting
4. The Birthweek Song
5. Jade Dumps Beck
6. Tori The Zombie
7. Robarazzi
8. Survival Of The Hottest (Title changed from Stuck In An RV)
9. Wi-Fi In The Sky
10. Beck's Big Break
11. The Great Ping-Pong Scam
12. Cat's New Boyfriend
13. Freak The Freak Out (TV Movie)
14. Rex Dies
15. The Diddly-Bops
16. Wok Star
17. The Wood
18. A Film By Dale Squires
19. Sleepover At Sikowitz's

I wish they would re-release it in the correct order and in Widescreen version.",1310169600,29,1311,4.219123505976095

4491003,5,B004X1M532,"Victorious sadly ended way before it ever should have. Almost always hilarious stories, the antics of every one of the characters (including Sikowitz)  kept me impatiently waiting for the following week's episode. Loved this show, those gorgeous girls, the coolest guys, and an amazingly strange- but oh so cool- teacher. The series is forever on my constant rotation list to keep the depression of its termination without warning at bay...",1453766400,3,440,5.285714285714286

4491037,4,B004X1M532,"This show is great. There's now doubt about that. Probably the best show on tv for it's demographic. The problem here is the contents of the DVD. The episodes aren't in real widescreen and the episodes are out of order as everyone said. Normally I wouldn't complain about the way the episodes are listed because I don't catch the show on tv when the new ones air. I catch the reruns, so it's basically the same thing. But the presentation comes off as a 'best of' for the show because of the random nature of the episode selection. Also, the bonus videos of 'meet Tori Vega/the cast' clock in at less that a minuite long each. So not bonus material. At least it could have had some interviews or blooper reels. The only goods thing on the DVD are the music videos and digital copies of the episodes. The digital copies are the only reason why I'm giving this 4-stars. Otherwise it would get three.

Edit: after a quick wiki search, I found out that the episodes are in order. They are based on the production number and not the airdate number. That means that the episodes were probably aired out of order.",1310428800,13,1106,4.448275862068965
