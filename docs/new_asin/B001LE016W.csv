3682841,5,B001LE016W,"Everything made by Theme Park Review is amazing!  RAW Volume 2 is an amazing pair of DVDs(one of wooden coasters and one for steel).  The POV shots give you that great feeling of sitting in the front of the coaster.  The quality of the video is superb as well.  After watching RAW 1 and 2, I can not wait for the spring when the parks open up.  Until then, at least I have the DVDs to give me my thrill fix.  I also recommend the Expedition videos that TPR sells.",1230854400,,463,4.088888888888889
3682842,5,B001LE016W,"Anybody looking for a Roller Coaster movie and buy something other than Theme Park Reviews ""Roller Coaster in the Raw #1 or #2 are making a big mistake. These are the best, bar none POV coaster films you will find. This is as close to actually riding on each ride as you can get. You get the stats and location of each coaster, watch them from many great view points, then take the ride. That simple! That perfect! You will be so happy with this purchase.
 Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review also gives fantastic personal customer service. Check out their web site. We won't get tired of watching Roller Coasters in the Raw #2 while waiting for #3.",1230595200,5,645,4.420168067226891
3682843,5,B001LE016W,"Next best thing to being there, this video, along with Vol. 1, bring coasters from around the world to your living room.  You hear the clank of the lift chain, the roar of the wheels, the screams, the wind whistling past your head.  You begin to ""feel"" the rides.  As you watch, you find yourself leaning right,then left with every turn.  I have never experienced videos like ""Roller Coasters in the Raw"" except in expensive simulators.  Great quality without the annoying commentary found on many cable documentaries.  Just all the fun.  If you can't travel around the globe to enjoy these mechanical wonders, BUY THESE VIDEOS!  If you've ridden these coasters and want to remember the fun and excitement, BUY THESE VIDEOS!  The best bang for the buck on the net.",1230508800,,764,4.770992366412214
3682844,5,B001LE016W,This really is a perfect DVD for anyone who is into roller coasters or theme parks.  You get to see amazing and professional footage of coasters both popular and obscure done in a way no other TV series or DVD has been able to match.  The funny thing is that even my non coaster loving friends find these DVDs interesting and have asked to watch them.  I think this would also be perfect for any physics students or teachers to help give a practical view of what happens when you ride a coaster.,1228089600,4,495,4.301075268817204
3682845,5,B001LE016W,"Robb Alvey does an excellent job with this DVD. All footage is great quality and professionally filmed. It has lots of good off-ride footage, and of course, amazing POV footage without any interruptions. My favorite thing about this coaster DVD is that it is unlike other coaster DVDs in that it has a great variety of coasters. Many of these I would have never seen any footage of or heard of without this DVD (i.e. Eagle Fortress). If you enjoy watching coasters or learning about some crazy unique coasters around the world, I highly recommend this DVD.",1228089600,3,556,4.742268041237113
3682846,5,B001LE016W,"Robb Alvey is back with another installment of the Rollercoasters In The RAW series. If you're like me...and you love coasters, but hate watching all those cheesy specials on Discovery and Travel Channel, then you will absolutely love this DVD. This is the closest you can get to riding some of the best and most unique coasters from around the world.  All the POVs are shot professionally and the experience is very realistic. Again if you even remotely like coasters, you must buy this DVD!!!",1227484800,9,494,4.811764705882353
3682847,5,B001LE016W,"I must say that I am really becoming a fan of the Roller Coasters in the RAW series. It was great to see wooden and steel coasters that I have ridden awhile back and they bring back memories. These POV's really bring out what it could feel like being on a coaster. Sure, a video almost never does a roller coaster justice for an overall ride experience but I think after seeing some the costers featured in RAW 2 it definitely made me think of traveling places to ride some of these rides. RAW 2 is just as entertaining and exciting as the first installment, Roller Coasters in the RAW. If you haven't already, I highly recommend buying both of these DVD's for some great high quality point-of-view footage from various roller coasters around the world.

I can't wait for the next installment of the RAW series",1227484800,,810,4.510204081632653
3682848,5,B001LE016W,"While my title may not be entirely true, I can guarantee that Theme Park Review's 'Roller Coasters in the Raw! Volume 2' is the closest thing you will get to in regards to experiecining the coaster without actually riding it. It is released at the perfect time as most parks are closed, and adrenaline junkies like myself need some more excitement. This DVD is the cure to the adrenaline craving. I have been on many of the coasters featured on this DVD, and it really does properly portray the riding experience. The best part is that all of the POV videos are front row, professionally recorded, and feature no annoying narration. It is a straight through POV with no cut away shots to give the best 'riding' experience. Plenty more is included such as reverse POVs, facts, off ride shots, and rider reactions. It is a great DVD for coaster enthusiasts and non coaster enthusiasts alike!",1227398400,2,889,4.705128205128205
3682849,5,B001LE016W,"I simply love these Roller Coasters: In the Raw DVDs that Robb Alvey puts out.  It features a wide assortment of complete onride/POV's of many roller coasters from around the world.  The footage is very smooth and professional.  It is also a good way to experience what some of these coasters are like, especially if you happen to be too scared to ride them.",1227312000,,358,4.5625

8317839,5,B001LE016W,The closest you can get to riding the coasters for real. Nice steady full POVs of each coaster and lots of off ride shots to give you a feel for what it looks like and how its laid out. Nice wide variety of different styles of coasters both nearby and in places you might never get to. Definitely a must have for any coaster enthusiast.,1394496000,,336,4.184615384615385

8317842,5,B001LE016W,"Ever dreamed of riding the famous Olympia Looping during Oktoberfest in Munich?  Or, perhaps, the classic Coney Island Cyclone in Brooklyn?  Maybe you'd like to check out the awesome Kawasemi in Japan, but simply don't have the scratch to make the trip?

8317843,5,B001LE016W,I enjoyed this one as much as the first.  I'm hooked on these things and now buy a new volume for my niece each year.,1342051200,,117,3.68
8317844,5,B001LE016W,Do not even think about it.. buy this AWESOME DVD!  The collection of coaster footage on this DVD is unmatched and looks AWESOME on your HD TV!  I was so happy to find so many unique coasters that you just can't find footage of online.  This one really hits it out of the park and is a must have for any collection!!!,1341878400,,317,4.080645161290323
8317845,5,B001LE016W,"Theme Park Review's ""Roller Coasters In The Raw"" series are essential for any roller coaster fan. They include extensive video footage without any distracting music or annoying hosts that other roller coaster DVDs have. There is coverage of more European coasters than ever before. The footage is shot exeptionally well. If you are an enthusiast or just someone who enjoys roller coasters, these DVDs surpass expectation and will bring you loads of entertainment.",1244764800,,463,5.3561643835616435
8317846,5,B001LE016W,"Thank you Theme Park Review for putting out quality videos! ""No silly music, no annoying commentaries, JUST ROLLERCOASTER FOOTAGE!"" There was no false advertising on the cover box. My favorites are the videos of Boulder Dash and Eagle Fortress - Those rides looks SICK!",1242086400,,269,5.136363636363637
8317847,5,B001LE016W,"""Coasters In The Raw!"" Vol. 1 & 2 are a highly recommended set of DVD-Rs from ThemeParkReview.com. If you are going to buy them, do so from their website for $10 a piece. They also have a fantastic 12 volume ""Coaster Expedition"" series showcasing all of the parks around the world that the C.E. groups have visited over the years. Concerning the ""Raw"" series, which now has a 3rd set available covering ""roller coasters that have been closed, demolished or re-located"". As with the first two sets, the third is also separated into ""woodies"" and ""steelies"", with 25 POVs for the first and 31 for steelies. This is way more than on the initials sets of the series, which only have 15 rides per type on disc, plus a bonus. In each series, a ride starts with data about it, then multiple views of the coaster in action from around or above it. Then you ride it from beginning to end seated in the front car. After that, you are treated to more multiple angles of the ride in action, sometimes from the rear car looking backwards or up the side. Rob Alvey and his crew always do a spectacular job on their footage, so you will not be disappointed. No other series of DVDs covers them as perfectly as ""Coasters In The Raw!"", as well as the ""Coaster Expedition"" series. But, as mentioned, get them from ThemParkReview.com. The purchase goes toward more C.E. trips and future DVDs, especially more ""Raw!"" discs.",1241913600,,1403,4.571428571428571
