5848648,5,B0009UC1VM,"So happy this little 'coming of age' gem finally made it to DVD. I was worried initially, that the image quality was going to be poor, but the many positive reviews on Amazon convinced me to take the plunge. The transfer looks great, and this 1983 indie film looks better now than I've ever seen it before. Like many other fans of this movie, I was first introduced to this film via it's many airings on cable TV, starting back in the mid 80's. I enjoyed it then, but now I love the movie. It's a simple story about a complicated time of life. The film is a window to the past, which captures the look of people then, the sights and sounds, and a style and pace of film making that's not seen these days.

Sarah Boyd's portrayal of Lonnie is wonderful, beautiful to watch. She captured something so precious, yet subtle and intangible, that it nearly defies any meaningful description. It's the mystery of girls. As far as I know, this is the only film she ever made as an actor, though I know she continues in the business as an editor. I really love her in this, and I dearly wish she would have continued to act, but then the fact that she didn't, makes this movie even more unique and precious.",1308700800,5,1198,4.3244444444444445
5848649,4,B0009UC1VM,"I remember watching this movie as a young teenager and thinking I wanted to live in the city; live where Lonny lived but be fun and crazy like Rainbow Harvest's character. Growing up in Long Island I wasn't that detached from the city, we'd visit family in Washington Heights, uptown and I vividly remember the city streets where I played with cousins. This movie reminds me so much of those days!! I cant believe I found it!!! It's going in my library for sure!!",1299542400,,463,4.523809523809524
5848650,5,B0009UC1VM,"I remember seeing this movie long ago and I loved it just as much as the last time I saw it. Having a daughter myself now, it's a great way to introduce subjects such as peer pressure, sex, etc..

It's a coming of age movie about a sheltered upper middle class preteen girl that meets a street smart lower class teenage girl who's had it rough in life. Their freindship is like night and day and extremely emotional because of their very different home lives. Over the span of one summer, they both discover the true meaning of friendship.",1170374400,9,539,4.444444444444445

5848677,2,B0009UC1VM,very dry and boring. subject is predictable and the only good part is watching a very young Allysa Millano as the younger sister stealing scenes.,1407196800,,145,4.84
5848678,5,B0009UC1VM,"As someone who loves the 80's and nearly grew up in them, (I was 5 when this movie came out), Old Enough has the exact perfect mixture of plot, acting, and scenery to make it an 80's favorite. My sister and I watched this again and again. We were fascinated by both worlds, Lonnie's somewhat disconnected high-brow family, and Karen's trashier yet more loving household. If you love the 80's like me this will not disappoint. It's also great to see all the branding of the various companies we all liked back then.",1389657600,9,514,4.537634408602151

5848680,4,B0009UC1VM,"The movie itself is not a great film, & there are parts that just seem confused & bizarre.  But it's not a bad movie either & there is definately some entertainment in it",1313193600,,170,4.151515151515151

8596652,5,B0009UC1VM,"In New York City, wealthy 12-year-old Lonnie (Sarah Boyd) meets working-class, streetwise 14-year-old Karen (Rainbow Harvest) and becomes close friends with her, despite their very different backgrounds.  Lonnie lives in a luxurious townhouse, complete with a maid, whereas Karen's building encompasses multiple, basic apartments.  Karen's visits to Lonnie's house introduce her to a calmer way of life; on the other hand, Lonnie's visits to Karen's area expose her to a world that is more down to earth...and where shouting, abuse, as well as sex, are commonplace.

A unique coming-of-age story, Old Enough will transport you back to New York City in the early 1980s, when kids still went outside to play, rode bicycles without helmets, and played stickball in the street.  Those of us ""old enough"" will relive an era before the Internet, iPhones, etc., when curious children befriended one another simply by joining in outdoor activities, coming over for dinner, and sleeping over one another's house.

In addition to nostalgia, there is also plenty of realism.  Lonnie and Karen's onscreen friendship was brilliantly portrayed and truly felt genuine.  Despite its ups and downs, to include the friction created when Lonnie becomes attracted to Karen's brother Johnny (Neill Barry), their friendship endures in the end, with Lonnie literally slapping reality into Karen, and Karen growing up, realizing her mistake, and befriending Lonnie once again.

Old Enough also stars Danny Aiello as Karen and Johnny's intimidating father and features a very young Alyssa Milano as Lonnie's cute little sister.  This DVD includes an interview with actress Roxanne Hart, who portrayed sensual upstairs-neighbor Carla.  Fans are sure to enjoy the actress's fond memories of working on the film.",1463356800,2,1784,5.431159420289855
8596653,4,B0009UC1VM,"If you were a teenager in the mid eighties, then you will, likely, appreciate the authenticity of this film. It's that nostalgic decade accuracy that makes this a cult period piece. Definitely a walk down memory lane for those of us who grew up in New York.",1462320000,,257,4.48936170212766

8596656,4,B0009UC1VM,"I like slice of life movies and when I first watched ""Old Enough"" over 10 years ago I was intrigued by it. Now after watching it again it didn't have the same effect on me, but I enjoyed it. The class conflict and coming of age themes are interesting and it's interesting to see NYC street life in 1983. The young cast is good, but I thought the best one is ALYSA MILANO (her very first movie) already showing her talent and making a great child actor.",1437436800,,452,4.206896551724138
8596657,5,B0009UC1VM,"I don't know if it's a ""great"" movie but I do know it is one that I watched several times when I was a little girl back in Mexico!
and one that I remembered. They used to show this movie a lot. It has stuck on me ever since, the music, the girl, the ambiance of the 80's.
It took me YEARS to remember the name of this memorable movie. I think it's nostalgic plot is the one that made me remember it for so long, that and that I never understood the meaning back then, probably because I was so little (but I knew there was one) .... Interesting to read that others found it for the same reason.",1437004800,,594,3.9583333333333335
