8395419,3,B003E7EKOI,"I'm not quite sure why this show is being made onto two different discs because I didn't think it was really that long at all. I did however enjoy it for the most part. It's your typical ""inside edition"" on Scientology though. Ex member all claim abuse from Scientology leader David Miscavige while those in the Church all deny the claims. If you are looking for something which discusses Scientology doctrine or beliefs this may not be what your looking for. This DVD pretty much just goes back and forth between Scientology members and ex members regarding accusations against the Church leader. My advice would be to save your money and see if you can find it on Youtube because once you watch it once I can't imagine why you would ever wanna re-watch it.",1391212800,2,758,4.622222222222222
8395420,3,B003E7EKOI,"""Inside Scientology"" is an ABC Nightline report on Scientology, presented by well-known reporter Martin Bashir. The Church of Scientology, a controversial new religious movement often regarded by critics as a cult, has recruited an impressive amount of celebrities to its ranks. Tom Cruise and John Travolta are the most notable. Bashir's report focus on the celebrity factor, especially Cruise's relationship with current Scientology leader David Miscavige. The broadcast also contains Bashir's classical interview (or non-interview) with Scientology spokesperson Tommy Davis, during which Davis stages a walk out when confronted by pointed questions about ""Xenu and the volcanoes"". Not the most interesting anti-Scientology report, perhaps, but still worth watching if you want to be up-to-date on the scandals surrounding this particular group.",1366675200,2,847,6.008264462809917
