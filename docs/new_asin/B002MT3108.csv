It was kind of cool that nine college students made some music, in 1973, and we only find about it now in this fascinating documentary, which apparently was filmed by one of the members of the band....in 1973.  Recently, kids from the same college found the long lost music and film, and restored it and released it.

Now the spoiler....

Apparently, this didn't happen, it's only a movie. The  whole thing is a ""what if"" movie, and frankly, the movie would be lot more powerful if had been true.

Good work by the singers and actors in the movie, who basically did the same thing that their fictional 1973 counterparts did, and came up with a band and music in a matter of weeks out of nothing.",1307577600,,718,4.5271317829457365
8374034,5,B002MT3108,"Novem is a documentary about a band and their music from 1973. The band died suddenly and tragicly after a week recording their music. The film is 16mm footage from their studio time and playing around as well. It is also the story of a modern day student who finds their material and tries to bring it to the masses.
  The music in this film is amazing. It is not restricted to one genre and has amazing melodies and lyrics. In addition seeing the band hash out these songs is spectacular. The film also has an Almost Famous feel to it as a band ""out of time.""
  The modern story is fascinating. Jordan, the college student who buys the masters and 16mm, goes to trouble to find out who and what they were.
  There is a secret to this film that I won't reveal. I don't think it changes its power in any way. After I saw the film, I'm now buying the movie and CD.",1267747200,,863,4.168674698795181
