972960,3,6305090637,"That's the line on the front of the ""Evil Ed"" box here in Belgium.  The cover displays a drawn man, whose head is cut in 2 by an axe.  Although the movie has it's gory moments, people who dislike gore: no scene in the movie is as gory as it's cover (which is a shame-i'll explain).
Although i read in most of the interviews that the film is a kind of tribute to ""Evil Dead"", director Sam Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell, i think also of the movie ""Braindead"" (or ""Dead Alive"", as it is called in America).  ""Braindead"" is the unbeatable combination of extreme gore, injected with brilliant humor.  I don't know if the version of ""Braindead"" is cut in America, but if you ever see the uncut version, you have seen horror at its goriest... and funniest.
The problem with ""Evil Ed"" is that the movie never dares to cross the line which ""Braindead"" leapt over.  The opening sequence is just pure genius (the first, quite demented, editor blows off his own head with a handgrenade while his cool, emotionless boss watches and tells he's fired!), but then the creators pull back and seem to be happy to offer little gore, combined with a more satirical kind of humor.  And that just doesn't work quite as it should be.  The director tried to put the humor in the English dubbing and the idiotic acting.  It appears also that the worst gore is in the movies which Ed cuts out.  This all points (for me) that even their 'uncut' version of the movie is still a film which seems 'cut'.  And that's a shame, because the final sequence of the film shows the genius of the first sequence.
To say it short: opening and ending great, the middle a little boring.  To be quite honest: since ""Braindead"", many so-called gory movies seem like child's play to me.  But even people who have seen less of this kind, will notice that this movie just could have been better.
If you look at the whole film, though, and you are not too demanding, it's quite amusing to watch how Ed becomes more stressed and demented by all the gore he has to cut out.
If nothing else is in your video store, you can rend this.  But if you want to see a ""top class"" example, get ""Braindead""",983664000,3,2146,4.375314861460957

The movie features some of the elite of swedish  actors on orders to make the movie exactly as it is. The dubbing is made on  purpose, don't think anything else!

However, this Americanized version, bastardizes everything that makes this movie so cool........ The end scene is one of  the best gore scenes ever produced and even in this, the uncut DVD, it is  cut. The irony here is this issue is addressed in the movie (cutting),  where ""EVIL ED"" himself is cutting a part in a movie so bad, that  its actually a comedic moment.

973064,3,6305090637,"In 1994 Sid was doing the usual weekend happy times when an interesting film appeared at our local video stores horror section. It looked so awful that we were just drawn to it, much thanks to our recent screening of Death Ring in which our eyes were opened to the goodness of b. The film was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>&nbsp;and we were told by the young video attendant ""I don't know where this came from. I don't even think I can rent this out."" Luckily we got it and were blown away by the ultra poor quality which we just seemed to love. It's very rare to find such a piece of garbage that enjoyable which is why were thrown for a loop with Evil Ed. Years back Sid's cousin saw this and said it was simply the worst thing he'd ever seen, and this stuck with us all these years. Somehow we were able to have a watch and discovered this one's right on par with the 94 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>.

This one opens up with a crazed film editor blowing up his own head by putting a grenade in his mouth. The scene is one of the most ridiculous things we've ever seen, but in the right way where you can't help but crack up. So it moves forward with a man Edward who takes the job of the newly deceased film editor. He's being forced to watch a film series called ""Loose Limbs"" which is said to be filled with tons of gore, nudity, and lots of sexy time. The more he watches the more he begins to unravel seeing strange visions of creatures in turn making him loose his mind. Once off the deep end he begins killing his co-workers and anyone that shows up at his house or in the nut house.

Evil Ed turned out to be an extremely enjoyable flick in the worst way possible. In no way will you enjoy this if you go into it with any expectations higher then bottom of the barrel low. It really is just awful in every sense but will be enjoyed by a very particular viewer. You really have to be like us and be able to find beauty in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grim/dp/B0002T7YKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grim</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uncle-Sam/dp/6305107068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uncle Sam</a>&nbsp;and many other poor choices. The acting is horrendous, the gore is so over the top, and the killings are just hilarious forcing you to laugh on a constant basis. For us Evil Ed was worth three stars under no controlled substances what so ever. If you laced the evening up with a little something it may have been a five star event, if that is even humanly possible. Guess it's just another disastrous gem from the old age of 90's horror.",1256256000,9,3037,5.432203389830509

The gore is dialed up to slapstick level and there are great gags galore. It has an Anti-Censorship message, but it never is preachy or takes itself seriously except for it's love of the horror genre which shines at its core. The only negative would be some uneven pacing but as a whole the movie is definitely worth a watch to diehard horror fans. In short it's an irreverant film, but never loses reverence for the horror genre.",1503446400,,645,4.6173913043478265
7883953,4,6305090637,"Back in the age of video, when VHS was the method of weekend movie viewing, the mom and pop stores competed with major chains by offering some off the beaten track movies. These were mostly made for video features but on occasion there were movies that hadnt fared all that well at the box office but seemed to do major business on tape. Most of these were horror films and in fact a number of directors making major movies today cut their teeth on these films. Those stores were packed with box art that caught the eye and helped to develop a cult following for a number of films. EVIL ED was one such movie.

The plot isn't overly developed. Money hungry film executive Sam Campbell has his hands on series of slasher films called the LOOSE LIMBS series. The problem is overexposure to the films leads to homicidal tendencies. His last editor locked himself up and eventually had to be killed to get his hands back on the print. In an effort to have them toned down enough to pass censorship inspection Sam transfers mild mannered Ed Swenson to his department, Splatter & Gore, to edit the films.

Ed is sent to a home Sam has set up just for this project with the first film in hand. The more Ed watches the weirder things get. He begins hallucinating, seeing a tiny demon running around the house. With each successive film Ed watches his darker side emerges, a violent psychopathic side that comes out when people stop by and interrupt his project. The question is will he edit the film as instructed? Will it eventually drive him completely mad? And will his homicidal tendencies erupt on an unsuspecting town, including his wife and daughter?

While it sounds simple, and in a way it is, the film puts on display all of those things that helped it develop the cult following that it has. The box art may have garnered the interest of gore hounds but not all movies with great cover art delivered. EVIL ED delivers on all levels. The story holds your interest and the gore level is about a 9 on a 10 scale, something gore hounds reveled in at the time and still do.

Heres the kicker. The movie may have been released on VHS but it happened about the time that video stores were beginning to die out. This may be part of the reason that fans were scouring to find it for such a long time, rarity. Made in Sweden while there was still a censorship board at the time it was intended to make fun of that board. The film makers were ridiculed by the board at the time. It seems theyve had the last laugh as the film has now been given a superb treatment by Arrow Video and found its way to blu-ray.

The release of this film by Arrow was greeted with glee by the horror community. Message boards and Facebook posts were agog that they now had a chance to own this film in the best way possible. Honestly Arrow Video has provided this film with so many goodies and in such great shape that it makes you wonder why major studios don't offer as good a product on mainstream titles as they do on theirs.

First off there are two versions of the film included here. Then we get to the extras. Wow. Included is a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys, a collectors booklet with writing by film critic James Oliver, the world premiere of the newly-extended version of the feature, the Keep Em Heads Rolling making of documentary, a featurette on the creation of the Special Edition cut, deleted scenes, bloopers, teasers and trailers, a still gallery and Lost in Brainland a never before seen extended 3 hour version of the making of documentary. Yes, a 3 hour making of which means its nearly twice as long as the movie itself!

Lets face it, this is not Oscar material here folks. It is plain and simple a gore filled horror film for fans of both horror and gore. It is a tribute to the movies that came from the eighties and lined the shelves of video stores everywhere. It is a poke in the eye at censors both in content and commentary in the story. For fans it will be something to sit with friends and have a good laugh over. For non-fans it will be a horror film that will test their limits. And, as always, it is more proof that Arrow Video is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to releasing films not quite mainstream but with the effort put behind it as if it were CITIZEN KANE. Kudos once more to them and their quest to be a favorite with fans.",1502323200,,4390,4.385749385749386

7883955,5,6305090637,"Evil Ed is that horror film that Ive always been meaning to watch ever since seeing the poster of a Steven Weber lookalike going crazy. It always sat at the back of my horror mind, teasing me to seek it out and watch it, yet I never did. Having said that, you can only guess at how delighted I was when Arrow Video announced their May lineup and what do you know, Evil Ed is coming to Blu-ray! Finally, I exclaimed! I can now watch this movie.

Well, I finally did watch the movie, and even though the film is poorly acted, the love that the creators have for horror films is very much evident on the screen. Each scene is littered with nods to other horror films (honestly, better horror films) and the special effects are fantastic for a film that was shot for an estimated $29,000 (unconfirmed). I cant stress enough that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously, not in the least bit. You also have to forgive the flicks jumbled mess of a story as well. If you can get past all that, youll realise you're in for a pretty fun treat.

REVIEW

The story for Evil Ed goes a bit like this. Edward is a tasked with editing the violent series Loose Limbs for distribution in markets where gore, nudity and violence are prohibited. Edward has to sit through countless hours of extreme footage, which eventually drives him insane. He starts to imagine monsters coming after him, or creatures living in his fridge telling him off. Eventually, Edward images that a creature tells him to cleanse the world of bad people and he starts with the people close to him.

Thats the gist of Evil Ed. There is more to it than that, as the film has a tendency to change things up each act. Viewers will probably find this weird story telling jilted, as the film has several moments where it could end, yet keeps going. Its pretty easy to tell that the movie was shot over five years, as it feels like there are three or four ideas in this film wanting to be told.

Nevertheless, the mishmash of story ideas gives the makers a chance to really cram in some crazy horror, gore and bits of comedy, giving a big middle finger to Swedens pre-1996 policy of censoring anything that had scenes of sex or violence. Evil Ed is one film that should not be taken seriously, or else youll never get past the terrible acting and dialogue.

The Arrow Video Blu-ray for Evil Ed includes the extended cut of the film, along with the shorter original cut. I watched the extended cut myself and went through the other cut to see the differences, and besides a couple of scenes, one that extends the fight scene near the third act, the two cuts are relatively the same. Whichever version you watch, youll be the getting the same film. Each cut has been cleaned up rather nicely, and even though the film is really low budget, the HD upgrade helps make the film look the best it ever has. The same goes for the stereo and 5.1 audio options. That menu music really pumps through your speakers nicely.

Given the history of the films trouble making, the special features are packed full of interviews and an extensive three-hour making-of. They dive into the issues that came up, and you can tell that the people behind the film really loved what they were doing. Of course, youll need to love the movie yourself to want to go through everything, as youll be hours. There are deleted scenes, a few hidden easter egg features on the first disc, a fun introduction, that crazy long making-of on the third disc and even more! Seriously, this Limited Edition is freaking packed full of goodies.

VERDICT

I really enjoyed Evil Ed, terrible acting and disjointed storytelling and all. The film is a love letter to horror fans, in which they provide you with ample amounts of gore, amazing special effects and some nudity to please the horny crowd (proud member right here). If you enjoy your horror loaded with cheese, youll get a huge kick out of Evil Ed, and the Arrow Blu-ray Limited Edition is going to keep your ass glued to your couch for hours.",1498089600,2,4011,4.476060191518468

7883957,5,6305090637,"I have to say, Im pleasantly surprised by EVIL ED.  Ive heard people talk about the film for two decades now, and a lot of what was said was negative.  But I was always curious about it, and I definitely wanted to give it a look.  Thanks to Arrow and MVD, I got the opportunity to do so in HD, and I found the film an absolute joy to experience.  As the synopsis mentions below, if you're a fan of THE EVIL DEAD, RE-ANIMATOR, or DEAD ALIVE, then youll certainly want to give EVIL ED a shot!

I like the discreet homages to classic horror movies that are sprinkled throughout this film.  For example, the title, EVIL ED, is a slight play on words from THE EVIL DEAD.  Also, Eds boss is named Sam Campbell, an indistinct reference to Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell from the DEAD trilogy.  Not to mention the NUMEROUS movie posters strewn throughout various scenes.  These direct and indirect tributes are one of the many joys youll experience with EVIL ED.

EVIL ED is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The HD transfer is very tight, and the picture quality is excellent.  I got to experience every blood splatter and hacked limb in glorious high definition.  Likewise, the sound quality is great as well.

The acting in EVIL ED is very good, with Johan Rudebeck portraying the titular character.  Surprisingly, Rudebeck only has a couple of credits on his IMDB page, with this role being the first; he is a great actor, and Im surprised we have not seen more of him.  The rest of the cast is great as well, however nobody really stands out like Rudebeck.

The special effects are superb, and theres plenty of gore to go around.  I am very impressed with the life-like quality the carnage has, and gore-hounds should be pleased with the amount of it.  Also, the creature effects are pretty slick; the grotesque Gremlin-like beastie is only in a couple of shots, but it looks great (perfect for a horror comedy).

The storyline in EVIL ED is intriguing and laughable at the same time.  It is a big part of what makes the film so much fun.  Watching Eds decent into madnessjust from watching LOOSE LIMBS movies (the fictional SAW-like series he is editing) is at time humorous and humbling.  Director Anders Jacobsson made the movie to take a shot at censor boards, and he definitely gets his point across.  The result is a vastly entertaining jaunt into humor and gore.

EVIL ED is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Its off-the-wall and campy in some aspects, but its 100 percent fun.  Part social commentary, part horror, and part downright comedy, this is one of those films youll watch more than once, so be prepared!  It is available now.",1496620800,10,2654,4.530526315789474
