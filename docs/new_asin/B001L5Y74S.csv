3723363,5,B001L5Y74S,"I saw this movie at a local screening and thought it was hilarious!  I see a lot of comedies and usually they give me a few laugh-out-loud moments that I pretty much forget about.  This movie however had moments that I would think about months later and still crack up at the thought of it!  It's definately a movie I could enjoy multiple viewings of.  Never before have I seen the topic of aliens and probing done this funny!  James Vallo was great in the lead role and the appearances by Robert Z'Dar, Butch Patrick, and Larry Thomas were very funny!  Definately check it out!",1228521600,3,578,4.457142857142857
3723364,1,B001L5Y74S,Awful.  Not even campy.  I ff most of it.,1432944000,,41,3.4444444444444446
3723365,4,B001L5Y74S,"Comedy plus science fiction, a great combo. I don't normally watch comedies, but had I skipped this video I would have missed out on the best laugh I've had in a while. I can see myself watching this again.",1432512000,,206,4.3076923076923075

3723368,3,B001L5Y74S,Not horrible but not real good either. It is done in a documentary sort of style so the movie frequently more less stops and goes into a interview like state with the various characters. Not what I was expecting.,1427328000,,212,4.461538461538462
3723369,2,B001L5Y74S,About 1/2 way through I realized that this would probably appeal to teenage boys more than it would to me.,1425945600,,106,4.35
3723370,1,B001L5Y74S,Not the movie I ordered. But it was really bad.,1424736000,,47,3.8
3723371,2,B001L5Y74S,"I can't believe that nobody mentioned Larry Thomas, the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. Does a cool cameo reprise of his claim to fame lines @ 1:08:55. Come on guys, r u all less than 10 years old?",1413676800,,190,4.162162162162162

3723373,1,B001L5Y74S,"I like campy sci-fi... but ""Spaced Out"" isn't campy. It's just plain awful. The acting is stiff and awkward. The writing is stilted. I just couldn't find anything to like here. Even Butch Patrick (Eddie from ""The Munsters"") was a disappointment. I lasted something less than 15 minutes, then had to switch it off. Low-budget doesn't have to mean bad, but this film is a complete waste of time.",1407715200,2,393,4.7101449275362315

3723375,3,B001L5Y74S,"Weird, but somewhat enjoyable.",1406851200,,30,6.75
3723376,3,B001L5Y74S,"I really can't figure out why so many people hate this movie.
Sure, it's low-budget, the acting is about what you expect from low-budget, and much of the humor is based on anal probing, but all in all it was a fairly entertaining show. It even had a few moments where I laughed out loud.

This will never be in the list of great movies, but if you don't mind the adolescent jokes, it's fun to watch.",1404432000,2,399,4.181818181818182
3723377,3,B001L5Y74S,"This would have worked better with better directing, but the plot was very good and believable. It could have been a little more ""Sinister""",1402617600,,139,4.833333333333333
3723378,5,B001L5Y74S,"The characters were great.  The acting first rate.
The story was intricate & it moved forward with a good rhythm.
If you lived in that era..you'll remember the times.
If you were born much later, it's a good idea of what society norms were like.",1399939200,,245,4.444444444444445
3723379,2,B001L5Y74S,"Video quality wasn't the best, acting was sub par. If they paid more than 500 to make this, they spent too much.",1399248000,2,112,4.136363636363637
3723380,1,B001L5Y74S,"Don't waste your time!
The only redeeming value, if you can call it that, is that it reveals how poorly this movie is made in the opening scene. That was enough for me, I stopped it right there!",1399075200,,194,4.131578947368421
3723381,1,B001L5Y74S,Poor.  I won't watch this a second time. I usually watch movies many times. It was a poorly done spoof on anal probing.,1396656000,3,119,4.173913043478261
3723382,1,B001L5Y74S,"A man returns to Earth after having been abducted by aliens, and relentlessly probed for two years. He is haunted by the extraterrestrial proctologists, who threaten to re-abduct him -for further probing- unless he agrees to tell no one about his experience. The aliens also want him to be their spy among the humans. They are tracking him through an implant in his left posterior region. He spends most of his time running into one annoying person after another. SPACED OUT would have made a tolerable short film of 20-30 minutes. At 1 hour 40 minutes it's a chore to get through! Though some jokes are (sort of) funny, much of it is dead air. Good luck wading through this tar-pit! Whew! Co-stars an almost unrecognizable Butch ""Eddie Munster"" Patrick, Fred Williamson, and the unmistakable Robert Z'Dar (MANIAC COP 1-3) as an armed robber...",1392508800,8,844,4.868055555555555
3723383,1,B001L5Y74S,I could s*** a better movie than this.  The turd would be a more likeable character than any in this movie.,1388016000,,107,4.095238095238095
3723384,4,B001L5Y74S,"Truly absurd in an anal sort of way .
Actually has some witty moments lacking in similar borderline amateur movies .",1385251200,5,116,4.571428571428571
3723385,1,B001L5Y74S,"Words really fail me to describe how poor this sci-fi (?) movie is. Although , I admit I didn't watch it all, it's because I could only stand 30 min. of it.",1380240000,,156,3.90625
3723386,1,B001L5Y74S,"I was looking for something to just give my mind a rest. Nothing serious, just relaxation. This started out okay but by the middle, the filth and grossness forced me to shut it off. Sometimes, I like mindless humor, but this was too far out for anyone.",1376524800,13,252,4.382978723404255
3723387,1,B001L5Y74S,This movie is not worth the effort it takes to click on it.  It's that bad.  Oh man.  Just don't.,1371427200,3,97,3.75

3723392,1,B001L5Y74S,"I could go to Best Buy right now, spend $200 on a digital recorder, come home make some puppets out of some old stanky socks, and film a conversation between the two socks that I make up as I go along.....and it would be better than this dog turd of a movie.  Seriously.  Better plot, better acting, better production value.

The only demographic that could possibly find entertainment in this is young, on drugs and not alone.  That's right, if you are under the age of 22, stoned on some kind of illegal substance and you're hanging out with a big group of friends, you all might have an enjoyable time razzing on the movie.

Unfortunately for me I was alone and sober when I decided to see why 2 people had given this crapper 5 stars.",1357862400,10,737,4.350364963503649
3723393,5,B001L5Y74S,"I was surprised at all the cactus references in this movie, which just added to the hilarity of the overall plot and the twist ending with the cactus.  The song in the credit about the cactus steamroller really wrapped up the movie.  I can't wait for the sequel!",1234483200,5,262,4.4375
8327896,3,B001L5Y74S,"The Name is Right On the Money. What is hard to believe, is the endless parade of less than movie star quality, yet still somehow watchable characters in a production that really works at presenting a not ready for prime time movie. At some point the more than obvious  pokes at comedy wear you down and somehow you find the value in this project. Quite the spoof It  not only lampoons the genre of rock bottom budget movie making It Pokes fun at everything. If you have to have Hollywood style production don't waste your time.
