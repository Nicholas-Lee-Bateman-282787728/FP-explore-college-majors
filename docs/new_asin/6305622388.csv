7893061,2,6305622388,"I was not expecting exceptional production for this DVD since most of what is out there for Nusrat is of the same calibre: Home movie type filming, amateur type post-production. But the most annoying thing about this DVD is the fact that about half-way into the program (DVD 2), the audio gets out of sync with video and then it becomes close to impossible to continue watching. My 2 star rate is for the song selection, general ambiance and DVD 1.",1178409600,4,448,4.54320987654321
7893062,4,6305622388,"Those of us who appreciate quawali for its spirituality, for what it is and for what it stands for, don't need MTV-style footage of its most ""vocal"" proponent in a thousand years.  Just the raw, unedited footage of Nusrateh Fateh Ali Khan is enough to inspire...",1044576000,3,262,4.695652173913044
7893063,3,6305622388,"Well, this concert was certainly not recorded with the purpose of a DVD release in mind. So the DVD lacks quality, in the areas of stage lighting, camera angles and sound quality.
But, given the lack of the great musician's live recordings, its a must have for all Nusrat fans. You can see very well the artist and his greatness as he displays ""the voice from Heaven"" and his talents in mesmerizing the audience.",1032048000,4,412,4.581081081081081
7893064,4,6305622388,"This video's audio quality is brillant, of course because it is a DVD.  The video quality is good, but the way it was filmed is not that  professional.  I say this because only about 2 different angles were used,  and the filming is not done on a professional camera.  It seems as if it  was done on a Home camera of some sort.  The quality is still great, and  this video is still a great collector to have, but don't expect 10  different camera angles.",941500800,9,454,4.247058823529412
