317278,3,6301218159,"Skeleton Coast is your run of the mill adventure film set in a foreign country with revolutionaries. Of course there's the money and intrigue and double crosses. You've seen it all before. Highlight is, of course, Ernest Borgnine, who always brings something special to his roles.",1347408000,,280,5.108695652173913
317279,4,6301218159,"Despite the fact that the main premise of the film is a rip off of the 1983 movie ""Uncommon Valor"" (starring Ernie's 'Poseidon' sparring partner Gene Hackman), this film lacks it's portentious nature and concentrates on non stop action,some great battle scenes (despite what was obviously a limited budget) and a group of veteran actors, knowing full well that this isn't exactly ""Shakespere In Love"", having fun with their roles: most notably Ernest Borgnine, who gives it everything he's got.

In fact,the ones who will enjoy this movie the most will be fans of the 60s TV sitcom ""McHale's Navy""--or 'mercenary army' in this case. Substituting for Joe Flynn (Capt. Binghampton) is Robert Vaughn playing a German colonel, forever frustrated by the rumors of the approaching army's invasion of the prison fortress and the political prisoners contained within:his constant berating of his assistant Schroeder reminds one of Bob Hastings' Lt. Carpenter in similar circumstances. Also the mercenaries themselves -- Leon Issac Kennedy plays 'Chuck'....at times one expects Tim Conway to stumble out of a doorway, followed by the inevitable explosion, a religious expert knife thrower, an elder statesman soldier, an explosives expert, a beautiful blonde who can handle herself in a fight and a ninja named Toshiro (no,no sign of 'Fuji') Led by the Colonel, with the help of a local rebel army, they invade the fortress to rescue the Colonel's CIA operative son--and pick up anything else that catches their fancy.

A great performance by Ernest Borgnine as the Colonel, in typical 'McHale' wiseguy fashion; his scene of him disguised as a Cuban sergeant and his ordering around of Vaughan's men and later when confronted by an army of angry soldiers is hilarious, reminding one of his 'Cousin Guiseppe' twin role on 'McHale'. His scenes with the Angolan rebel leader played by Simon Sabella are beautifully performed and are unlike scenes normally found in action pictures. Also on hand is Herbert Lom as a slightly shifty informer and Oliver Reed as the head of the country's diamond security (The scene when he launches a rocket attack on Borgnine and co.-""Fire! Fire! Kill the bastards!""- is a highlight--obviously he was looking forward to heading off to the pub when this shot was completed!)

All in all, a pleasant feel good action picture--and most heartily recommended for all ""McHale's Navy"" and Ernest Borgnine fans.",1109721600,6,2423,5.1603053435114505

The All Star Cast is true. Unfortunately they were all stars many years ago. There's the knife guy, the Asian karate/nunchuck guy, the Black guy, the hot chick and the 80s mullet wearing macho dude.

I was informed by the digital customer support representatives that they could not view the product to determine if it had audio or not, that had to be done by their development team. I may be missing something here, but it would seem to me that this would be a natural obligation of the customer support folks. They simply do not have a means of doing this!

I was informed that their development people would eventually look at it, and I would be notified when it was corrected. In the meantime, it is still on the website for rental and purchase download! There is apparently no quality control at Amazon for their digital products. This is ridiculous!

I have rented/purchased and downloaded other products which are just fine when played on my desktop. The problem lies with the digital product in this and three other cases which I will be documenting. Hopefully, this will provide the apparently necessary catharsis to Amazon to fix its digital download problems!

The film was great way back when in the theaters and I would really like to watch it again. Maybe Amazon will eventually fix it and I will be able to do so.",1364515200,,1243,4.636363636363637
7810063,4,6301218159,"This was not a candidate for an Oscar. I saw the negative reviews and wondered how a movie could be so bad with actors Ernest Borgnine, Herbert Lom, Robert Vaughn and Oliver Reed in the cast. So I bought it and took an easy chair and kept an open mind. The music ranged between interesting to annoying, the action -- and there was a lot of it -- seemed to alternate between good to preposterous -- as did the script and plot. Things could have been better.  This 1987 movie was a product of its time. Although the day of the drive-in, open air, in your car movie theater was winding down, you could still go and see two or three movies like this in an evening.  And many Americans did.  It was the end of an era.  Similarly, this was the end of an era for the four previously well-known and lauded actors in this film.  Skeleton Coast was a B grade movie of that time. So why do I give it 4 stars? It is perhaps the only movie loosely based on Joseph Savimbi's heroic struggle against dictatorship in Angola and against the communist ""Cuban Brigade"" in Africa.  I was in the military at the time and Savimbi was one of my two foreign heroes. I also had crossed the Sahara and Congo regions a few years previously as a civilian at the bush level and have a thing for the Africa as a great, if troubled, continent. So perhaps my higher rating is purely personal. I also like it when I feel good when a movie ends. Borgnine's relationship with the Savimbi-like African leader is warm and respectful and reciprocated (this war was still going on when the movie came out).  The ""good mercenaries"" became friends and the obligatory blonde in shorts broke through any stereotype by fighting well. I liked the ""good guys"" in it.",1518825600,,1720,4.3730407523510975
