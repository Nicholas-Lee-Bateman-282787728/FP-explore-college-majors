3063507,4,B00118SUIE,"I am writing this review as I watch the movie. One thing that needs to be made clear is this product is ""manufactured on demand"" using DVD-R recordable media. So make sure your DVD player plays DVD-R media before you buy it. Many DVD-R movies are low quality, however as far as this movie goes, this DVD of the movie is in excellent shape and seems to be an unedited version coming in at 85 minutes long. IT IS ALSO IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT. I replaced a VHS copy of this movie that had seen its better days (and had the title ""Castle of the Walking Dead"" in standard 1.33 screen), so I am glad I bought it. Desert Island Classics used an excellent source for this movie, there are no dropouts or other imperfections. There are no extras on this DVD - but that is OK with me, as long as I have a good copy of this movie.",1433376000,9,816,4.138364779874214

3063510,4,B00118SUIE,"Finally a decent DVD version of one of my favorite Euro-Horror films is cause for rejoicing. TORTURE CHAMBER (not the original title which is THE SNAKE PIT AND THE PENDULUM) is a German made film from 1967 by Krimi specialist Harald Reinl. It has outstanding camerawork and some outrageous set pieces. Think of Poe's PIT AND THE PENDULUM reimagined as a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm or as a story by E.T.A. Hoffmann. The movie opens with a remarkable tracking shot that follows Christopher Lee  as he is led down a series of corridors on his way to be executed. He is to be quartered and this sequence is well staged in the historic town of Rothenburg. Move forward 35 years when two descendants of the people responsible for his death (Lex Barker and Karin Dor) are summoned to a castle where they are summarily imprisoned and tortured as a resurrected Lee and his servant (Karl Lange) need Dor's blood to attain immortality. Several images linger in the mind from the forest of limbs to the Hieronymous Bosch room. The wall of skulls and the flesh eating vultures are another nice touch that you don't run across every day. Totally surreal to say the least. The one drawback, as noted in other reviews, is the soundtrack which uses German muzak for the carriage scenes. Mildly annoying but that helps to date the film and is not without its own peculiar charm.

The second film on the DVD, DEATH SMILES ON A MURDERER, was made in 1973 and shows the changes that had taken place in this genre in just a few years. While still a period piece, it incorporates elements from the Italian Giallo films which had come to prominence. More graphic violence is shown and nudity and sex scenes are added to spice up the proceedings. Once again we have a film in which Klaus Kinski's voice is dubbed along with the others (none of them very well) and we get a chance to see what happened to Swedish actress Ewa Aulin after her one brief stab at fame in CANDY. As a period piece DEATH SMILES looks seriously modern which is not to my taste but there's no denying the film's effectiveness. Hats off to Legend House for giving us the twin bill which enables us to enjoy and compare and pick our favorite. Despite what I have read in some of the other reviews, I found the picture quality on this disc to be outstanding. Both films are presented in widescreen format and feature recreated titles which is not surprising when you consider how often this drive-in fare was served up under several different guises. In fact there is an amusing short piece EURO TRASH MANIA which tells us all about it. The DVD even comes with commentary for the two films (they were done in someone's home and you can hear an ice cream truck in the background).",1253836800,15,2731,4.537525354969574

3063513,4,B00118SUIE,"I am not going to review this because I have not seen it yet -- I'll say upfront that the reason I gave it 4 stars is because Amazon does not let you post a review unless you rate it -- 4 stars is what I gave this company's last release. But this DVD is still a good week and a half away from release. If not more, as I hear through the retailer grapevine it may be a week late. Which makes me wonder what the hell this guy Nyland ""Squonkmatic"" is talking about? How could he have even seen it? His review is dated early February! Legend House, to my knowledge, operates out of L.A. and this guy hails from back East. Plus note, his review is an overly personal and pissed-off attack on the company like he has an axe to grind. Legend House puts out alot of stuff that is in public domain, as do companies like BCI, Alpha Video, VCI and Retromedia, to name only a few. DVDs are not bootlegs if they are DVDs of movies in the public domain. And these two movies are most assuredly in the public domain. Note the numerous other DVD releases of DR.SADISM. DEATH SMILES likewise saw many different incarnations from different VHS companies (as well as several different theatrical releases from low budget theatrical distributors in the '70s & '80s), though to my knowledge it has yet to show up in America on DVD -- probably because there are no decent elements around. Legend House has put out alot of fun stuff and don't deserve the bad rap. Word going around at places like the Grindhouse shows at the New Beverly and Cinefamily theaters in Los Angeles is that there is bad blood between a company called Code Red and Legend House because Legend House put their public domain DVD out of BARN OF THE NAKED DEAD before Code Red got their public domain version out. Waannhh!!! Baby wants its bottle!! Talk about a tempest in a teapot. I do not know any of the Legend House crowd other than to nod to them if I see them out at the movies. But this kind of obvious competitor bashing makes me mad. Hey, Amazon! Wake up! How does this S. Nyland guy's review fit into your ""review guidelines"", especially when he (or she) obviously hasn't even seen the DVD yet! The date they posted their review should have been a dead giveaway. When this is finally available I'll review it again -- but based on actually WATCHING it. I may give it 1 star or I may give it 5 stars, but at least I will have SEEN it first before passing judgement. One thing I will say for it right now though, if this is good visual quality I'll be happy. These are two of my favorite Euro Gothic horror pix and it is a brilliant idea to put them together on a double feature. So far, so good.",1205539200,43,2654,4.278330019880715

3063524,3,B00118SUIE,"Spiffy scenery; really neat old German villages and horse-drawn carriages along some nice period costumes and great cleavage sported by Karin Dor.  Other than that, it's a 1967 German B movie horror flick with B-grade production values, acting, and plot.  It's earlier Christopher Lee film.  He is still developing his acting skill, and it shows.  It has a nod to Edgar Allen Poe's short story ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" but the plot is really entirely different; this is a fantasy horror story about a resurrected madman seeking eternal life.

Reading other reviews, I'm not sure that we're all talking about the same film.  This is a 1967 German film originally entitled Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel, ""The Snake Pit and the Pendulum"" (which would be a great title for a film about the current state of politics in the USA in 2016, but isn't).  As one might expect, the salacious cover image for the video release doesn't have a whole lot to do with the content of the film, though there are references to how 35 years before, Count Regula murdered a dozen virgins in his torture chamber.  Look up ""The Blood Demon"" in the Wikipedia if you want spoilers.",1456790400,5,1160,4.736318407960199
3063525,2,B00118SUIE,Great come on for a not so good movie.  Really did not give the kind of movie the written information said it would be. Christopher Lee plays the kind of character that he normally plays (the bad guy).,1455062400,,201,4.2894736842105265

It's all about a fakeass Dracula... The antagonist name is Count Regula who comes back from the dead and needs blood for eternal life...

3063533,5,B00118SUIE,"THE TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR. SADISM (aka: CASTLE OF THE WALKING DEAD, BLOOD OF THE VIRGINS, TORTURE ROOM, etc.) opens w/ the sentencing of the despicable Count Regula (Christopher Lee- HORROR HOTEL) to death by quartering. Before departing this world, the Count curses his captors. Thirty five years later, Roger von Marienberg (Lex Barker), the son of Regula's prosecutor, receives an invitation to visit the castle Andomai. Said invitation has apparently come from Count Regula himself! Obviously, Roger simply must head straight for the castle. Along the way, he saves a beautiful Baroness (Karin Dor- ASSIGNMENT TERROR) and her maidservant from a band of brigands. Hideous, supernatural horror soon follows when the Baroness is abducted by a strange man. Filled w/ dreary atmosphere and fog-filled, eerie sets and scenery -the best of which is the ""forest of dead bodies"", TTCODS moves along at a drunken snail's pace. Still, the mysterious build-up is quite effective. Once at the castle, Roger finally meets his host, discovering his terrible secret. The castle itself is awesome indeed, packed w/ labyrinthine passages, hallways, and tunnels. Regula is also impressive. His resurrection ceremony is memorable. Lee is at his malevolent best in this role, making full use of his towering frame and thundering voice! His appearance is certainly worth the wait. Loosely based on Poe's PIT AND THE PENDULUM.

This is a 1967 German film originally entitled Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel, ""The Snake Pit and the Pendulum"" (which would be a great title for a film about the current state of politics in the USA in 2016, but isn't).  As one might expect, the salacious cover image for the video release doesn't have a whole lot to do with the content of the film, though there are references to how 35 years before, Count Regula murdered a dozen virgins in his torture chamber.  Look up ""The Blood Demon"" in the Wikipedia if you want spoilers.",1456790400,5,1160,4.736318407960199
3298022,2,B00118SUIE,Great come on for a not so good movie.  Really did not give the kind of movie the written information said it would be. Christopher Lee plays the kind of character that he normally plays (the bad guy).,1455062400,,201,4.2894736842105265

3298026,4,B00118SUIE,"I pictured a bunch of dudes who got some cameras and some acid then thought let's make a movie. There are plenty of WTF scenes, early in the movie a man stares at a woman and her clothes disappear. The butler is totally creepy and for no particular reason is whipping some woman who is covered in fake blood. Then the ending makes you think you should have a hangover from watching.",1453248000,4,382,4.319444444444445
3298027,1,B00118SUIE,This is truly torture for anyone watching it.  It is more like a cartoon than a movie.  I kept expecting Scooby and Shaggy to pop in.  I watched it for Christopher Lee.  If he has been in a worse movie I have not seen it.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  It didn't.....,1452816000,3,275,3.909090909090909
3298028,2,B00118SUIE,"Wow, can't believe I watched the whole movie. This is one of those movies that's so bad it's comical and cannot be taken seriously. For a movie that's called ""Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism"" besides the fact there is no one named Dr. Sadism in the movie, is there is no torture in the movie period. It's all about a fakeass Dracula... The antagonist name is Count Regula who comes back from the dead and needs blood for eternal life... (-_-)  I gave it 2 stars just for the backgrounds and sets even though some dummies were painfully obvious.",1452297600,,542,4.474747474747475
3298029,2,B00118SUIE,A very young-looking Christopher Lee isn't on screen all that much.  A great deal of the movie is an interminable carriage ride to the Count's ruined castle.  Nothing to write home about.,1448064000,,187,4.8125
3298030,5,B00118SUIE,"THE TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR. SADISM (aka: CASTLE OF THE WALKING DEAD, BLOOD OF THE VIRGINS, TORTURE ROOM, etc.) opens w/ the sentencing of the despicable Count Regula (Christopher Lee- HORROR HOTEL) to death by quartering. Before departing this world, the Count curses his captors. Thirty five years later, Roger von Marienberg (Lex Barker), the son of Regula's prosecutor, receives an invitation to visit the castle Andomai. Said invitation has apparently come from Count Regula himself! Obviously, Roger simply must head straight for the castle. Along the way, he saves a beautiful Baroness (Karin Dor- ASSIGNMENT TERROR) and her maidservant from a band of brigands. Hideous, supernatural horror soon follows when the Baroness is abducted by a strange man. Filled w/ dreary atmosphere and fog-filled, eerie sets and scenery -the best of which is the ""forest of dead bodies"", TTCODS moves along at a drunken snail's pace. Still, the mysterious build-up is quite effective. Once at the castle, Roger finally meets his host, discovering his terrible secret. The castle itself is awesome indeed, packed w/ labyrinthine passages, hallways, and tunnels. Regula is also impressive. His resurrection ceremony is memorable. Lee is at his malevolent best in this role, making full use of his towering frame and thundering voice! His appearance is certainly worth the wait. Loosely based on Poe's PIT AND THE PENDULUM. Highly recommended for connoisseurs of the macabre...",1447632000,2,1461,5.356521739130435

8241088,3,B00118SUIE,"Good enough movie for its type, but subtract one star for what is possibly the single most inappropriate soundtrack of all time. OK, we have a kind of Gothic horror flick in some sort of 18th or early 19th century time frame. Christopher Lee (not used nearly enough) is the sadistic baddie and Lex Barker (looking more like a city slicker cowboy than a German nobleman) is the stoic hero. The sets, especially in the castle, are fun. The story is fine in that unbelievable horror kind of way-- bad guy back from the dead hunting down the last remaining families of those who brought him to justice in the past. Throw in a rogue, a couple servant types, a fraidy cat driver, and it's kind of fun. But then you get a soundtrack that's like a Blake Edwards Pink Panther jazz track from the 70's-- really bizarre. I mean, to the point that it actually distracts and detracts. So I have to take away a full star for it.",1505692800,,914,4.382352941176471
8241089,3,B00118SUIE,"Watchable enough, with some decent beer and lowish expectations. Good atmosphere and scenery. Quite a few stretches of credibility and questionable scenes, but also some nice touches of imagination here and there, and a pace and duration that won't put you to sleep. If you're a Christopher Lee completist, this one probably won't be anywhere near the top of your list of favorites, and he's pretty much slumming here, but there are definitely far worse movies you could waste your time on. Scratch this one off and call it good, if you must. Enough said.",1502236800,,555,4.852631578947369
