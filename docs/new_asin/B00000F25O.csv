1200622,4,B00000F25O,"ANZACS is the original ""Band of Brothers."" Five episodes each about 90 minutes long, cover a group of Australian volunteers enlisting in 1914 and fighting till the Armistice in 1918. These men become part of A Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 1st Australian Division. They fight in Gallipoli and then move to the western front to participate in all the major British offensives. Although there is some social and political drama the focus is on thier experience in the war. The uniforms and equipement are mostly spot on. The combat scenes a pretty good for a 1985 TV series. But the quality of the series is exactly that. It looks like you are watching it on your TV in 1985. Aside from this negative comment (hence only four stars), I would recomment this series for any military history buff, and any Australian, for that matter.",1244073600,5,846,4.801369863013699
1200623,5,B00000F25O,"THIS IS A GREAT TELEVISION MINI SERIES THAT FOLLOWS AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS FROM PRE WW1 THROUGH OUT THE MAIN BATTLES FOUGHT BY AUSTRALIANS AT GALLIPOLI AND FRANCE TO THE ARMISTICE AND POST WW1. I PERSONALLY USE THIS SERIES AS A LEARNING TOOL FOR ARMY CADETS AND HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY LESSONS, THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SERIOUS COLLECTOR.",1229990400,,334,4.775862068965517
1200624,3,B00000F25O,"First off, the American VHS release, listed here, has been dramatically edited from it's original six plus hours to down around two.  This is very unfortunate.  While the cut down version in itself is not a bad movie, the uncut series is nothing short of outstanding. The acting and  production values are top notch ( Paul Hogan is fantastic, as are Andrew Clarke and Jon Blake ). World War 1 buffs will be very pleased at the dedication to authenticity in the series.  In fact to me the series is almost on par with Spielberg's Band of Brothers.  At any rate, while I can only give the American VHS release 3 stars due to it's editing, the uncut mini-series is definately a 5 star in my book. The uncut 3 disc DVD ( Region 4 ) is often available on EBAY.  While it cannot be watched on an American DVD player, it can be viewed on a laptop or PC with a DVD drive.",1195171200,10,863,4.2317073170731705
1200625,3,B00000F25O,"This is an interesting chronicle of the ANZACs, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.
This made-for-Aussie-TV production is aimed squarely at the Australian audience, who still revere the memory of the ANZACs, the troops who suffered horrendous losses at Gallipoli in WWI. The heroism of the ANZACs became legendary. In fact, they fought so bravely and with such determination that the Turkish enemy erected a monument to them.
While it is true that the film (culled from a five-part mini-series), is not riveting entertainment compared to something like ""Centennial"" or ""War and Rememberance"", it does outline the feelings, views, and politics of the day faced by the ANZAC forces.
The Australian and New Zealand viewpoints of the Great War are rarely on display, and here we have all of the various sentiments played out before us. The overall feeling (still is tangible today), is that the incompetence and arrogance of British officers, under whom the ANZAC force operated, were directly responsible for the waste of lives in pointless charges against the heavily-entrenched Turkish forces.
The mini-series is positively anti-colonial in regards to the portrayal of the British as uncaring, and more interested in saving British lives than that of the Aussies or New Zealanders.
Paul Hogan will most likely be the only familliar face for American viewers. I would recommend the Mel Gibson film ""Gallipoli"" for those looking for a familliar cast and a relatively big budget look. That film also has more weight to it, and is more stylized.
While ""ANZACs"" does come off as a bit like ""light drama"", or perhaps almost a glorified soap opera, if someone is interested in the topic of WWI, and the Australian and New Zealand participation in particular, the mini-series is worth a viewing. For scholars studying the events in this theater of the war, ""ANZACs"" is a must see to examine both the attitudes of the day, and at the time the mini-series was made.",1017619200,26,1961,5.036923076923077

7906409,5,B00000F25O,"This series almost rivals Band of Brothers and Lost Battalion in quality.  It follows a platoon of ANZCS through WW1 starting in 1914 just as the war starts.  The first 2 episodes are excellent.  Subsequent episodes are of lesser quality as some extraneous events are thrown in (love stories, bars, almost excessive pseudo-comic relief by Paul Hogan) ; however overall it is a worthwhile presentation of WW1 with appropriate equipment (including a good, working mock up of a Mark V tank).  Overall, you will be entertained and not be disappointed by this series.",1389657600,2,562,5.010752688172043
