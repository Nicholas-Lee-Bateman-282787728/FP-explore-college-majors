5974049,5,B00FB6FT4U,"Lots of arguing on you-tube about whether these girls are heavy-metal or pop music. WHO CARES!  These girls and the management producing them are Entertaining with a capital E! Hard rockin' music with the three cutest Japanese girls singing and dancing up a storm. Even given the high price, I'm glad I bought this DVD;bought the CD too. Love it.",1411257600,6,346,4.766666666666667
5974050,5,B00FB6FT4U,"I am giving this blu-ray five solidified star ratings for several reasons that will assist the real american consumers into finding it as a valuable collection that represents the new age of metal in the history of music. This blu-ray has merged three phenomenal concert film footage into one total package. Suzuka Nakamoto leads the listener vocally into a rhythmic journey that uniquely varies individually in each song, from fuzzy pop to fierce deathmetal riffs and back again. The amplified energy resonating from Moa Kikuchi and Yui Mizuno twists and turns into a battle of neverending fight for audience attention as they perfectly hone their scream/dance choreography into the seamingless sea of spectating fanatics. Blessed are the ones who decide to share this BABYMETAL collection to the friends and family members who have openminded thought processing patterns, for they enlighten the curious.",1407715200,6,905,5.380281690140845
5974051,5,B00FB6FT4U,"This is amazing! I love everything about Babymetal. To you people who have no idea what you're talking about with the ""lip syncing"" crap. First of all they do not lip sync. They only did it with one song when they did Head Bangya!! the pop version without the band. You need to open up your ears and pay attention. No one lip syncs anymore Unless it's Britney Spears or for a live tv show.",1407628800,3,389,4.2
5974052,5,B00FB6FT4U,"I mean they rock, literally. As in this is rock music. It's like dusting off something I haven't heard since the 90's and then putting it in gothic-Lolita. It rocks as much as it is hot! How long has it been since anyone who wasn't 90 years old and was covered in tattoos, or body hair rocked out hard core. 30 years? 40 years? Never? In any case if you aren't already immersed in Japanese culture you're probably going to pull your hair out when you here them combine j-pop with stunningly good heavy metal, but, then again, they aren't trying to get someone like you to like them. This is for people who can watch Anime, and then get in the car and turn on Metalica, and not feel like they betrayed America.. For you, this is the best of both worlds. It's metal with a heart, and no one had to hire a Michael Kaman (S&M) to give it a soul.",1400889600,8,841,4.1656441717791415
5974053,4,B00FB6FT4U,"These chicks are part of a well orchestrated machine that is so bizarre that its catchy.  Like other posters have noted a lot of the stuff is lip synced but dang the marketing behind this is just doing magic.  This group really should be shared with your friends if you get this DVD.and introduce them to the newest bizarre musical craze in Japan and on YouTube.  The price is fairly steep due to the ""apparently"" extravagant sums on staging, costuming, music, and promo, just be glad you aren't buying one of the $500.00 DVD sets.",1396224000,2,531,4.568421052631579
5974054,5,B00FB6FT4U,"Ok everyone, two words  BABY METAL  These three teens singing Japanese Pop, metal, and their dancing, and they are gorgeous in a way that is hard to believe.  Ok, so, it's Neil young, Beach Boys, then Baby Metal.  Sorry Moby, Pink Floyd, Beatles, Dido, etc.  When you hear their hit I want choco you'll see why their first DVD sells for $90 today on Amazon.  And their 3 DVD/CD combo is going for over $400.  Serious.  No way am I paying $400+.  Especially since I already just paid the $90+.",1395187200,4,492,4.377777777777778
5974055,4,B00FB6FT4U,"So what we have here is actually three entire live concerts that took place between 2012 and 2013, labelled I, D, and Z.

First up is ""I."" If I wanted to introduce Babymetal to someone, this would be pretty much the ideal way to do it. It starts off with the standard ""BABYMETAL DEATH"" and continues through most of their older songs backed by the skeleton (fake) band. The audio mix is very close to the recorded versions, and while I doubt that Suzuka is singing live, it's probably the most convincingly ""live"" of all three concerts. The real treat, though is the encore, where the real band comes on stage for ""HEADBANGER"" and ""Ijime, Dame, Zettai."" Either they've got me completely fooled, or the vocals are live (and awesome!), and these songs completely seal the deal. Now that they seem to have a stable live band, hopefully going forward the goal is to eliminate or cut down on the pre-recorded stuff because SU-METAL is easily up to the task and the live band sounds a million times better than the same thing you could listen to at home.

Next is ""D,"" which has the dubious honor of being the most off-beat, but also weakest show of the bunch. I don't mean to keep harping on this, but I'd rather have completely awful live vocals than canned recordings. Especially when your lead singer is obviously up to the task. And boy, is this one canned. Even the lip-synching is fairly awful. No live band this time, but we do get a handful of songs that I've never heard anywhere else. I'm not sure if they're covers, or what, but as this is also labelled as ""Christmas Festival"" it seems like it might be some ""festive"" songs that I'm unfamiliar with, Babymetal-ed up. And they're not bad! The weirdest thing here is an odd, electronic version of ""HEADBANGER!""... which they then play again in the encore, but this time it's the normal version. For extra fun, add ""every time MOA-METAL makes eye contact with the camera"" to your drinking game.

""Z"" is the most recent of the three, but it's not too different from ""I,"" all told. Of note is the sound mix, which is noticeably more aggressive sounding than the other shows. Even the pre-recorded songs have a bit more life in them, which is a nice touch. The vocals are again almost certainly pre-recorded, but even they have a more ""live"" sound to them. Like ""I,"" this one has an encore with the live band which completely blows away the rest of the show. This time, it's ""HEADBANGER!"" ""BABYMETAL DEATH,"" and ""Ijime, Dame, Zettai,"" the latter of which was also used to open the show... yeah I don't know either. I'd kind of like to see the reaction to another band opening and closing their sets with the same song.

So about the price. This thing isn't going to come cheap, from anywhere. I think the lowest I've seen it was around like 60 bones which is pretty ridiculous. But for a band with about 12 songs in total, you get a surprising amount of content here. 2 excellent shows, and one pretty good one. The video and sound quality is top notch (although for the pre-recorded parts, you'd have no excuse for it not to be). If you're not in the position to be able to see them in person, it's not a terrible substitute, all told, and definitely cheaper than a plane ticket to Japan.",1392336000,25,3240,4.505102040816326
5974056,5,B00FB6FT4U,"Anyway...this is not 3 separate discs -- It's one disc with 3 live performances on it. The majority of it is pre-recorded with live vocals, then there is newer material with a full live band (Which is the best part.) If you're really into Babymetal, this is great. Suzuka is awesome, her voice is amazing. Also...some songs appear here that can't be found on any of Babymetal's previous releases, due to them being covers and what not.",1391644800,7,435,4.662337662337662
5974057,3,B00FB6FT4U,"Some of BabyMetal's early Concerts. yeah some Lip Sync and The Skeletons Dont Really Play the Music. Not like  Sadaku(The Ring) Men They Play Guitars,Bass & Drums. Still I Really liked IT. so Im So LOOKING forward For Future Performances Like They did in Inazuma Rock Fest.",1390867200,5,273,4.808510638297872
8613996,5,B00FB6FT4U,"At first, I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy this Bluray because BABYMETAL was more backing-track Idols than the live band powerhouse that they are today. But it was worth it for the photo book that came with it (which was a pleasant surprise). Plus Legend D and Legend Z concerts had some pretty memorable moments (e.g. YUIMETAL fulfilling her Karen's Girls dream and SU-METAL being quite sassy at the end of Legend Z).",1524009600,,417,4.726027397260274

8613998,5,B00FB6FT4U,"I liked how they, Babymetal started. They are great for being Japanese. They way that the school that helped them get into the music industry is very fascinating to me. The girls were trained from a young age to sing and that helped them to develop their talent to what it is today. That needs to been here in the US. Train kids to sing and act is a good thing not just let them just wing it by themselves. So overall good movies and I hope that they keep up the great work that they do. I will continue to watch their progress as they go.",1490313600,,539,4.046728971962617
8613999,5,B00FB6FT4U,I was amazed at how these young performers put on such an amazing show. I was not put of by them singing to backing tapes with the pretend skeletan band. I just enjoyed the performance. I can't get enough babymetal.,1482019200,,215,4.4
8614000,4,B00FB6FT4U,"Essential BABYMETAL. Shows the developmental days of the BABYMETAL of today. Some phenomenal cover tracks are only found here, and overall an interesting look at early BM.",1466294400,,171,5.37037037037037
8614001,5,B00FB6FT4U,"Okay so lets start here:
Legend ""I"" is a very early show. I would say 80% of the vocals are dubbed and the band is obviously fake. (But of you are a Babymetal fan, you already knew this) with an appearance by the Kami band for the last few songs. overall this is a pretty good show and is, in itself, a solid show for an early preformance.

Legend ""D"" is the second show and is again, dubbed and has the skeleton band. Like the last show it is deffinately worth watching but unfortunately, no Kami band this time around.

Legend ""Z"" is by far the best of the shows and again has the Kami band at the end. This show seems to have the least dubbed singing and the most energy out of all 3.

Bottom line, if you can afford this rare item, grab it while you can. It is deffinately worth the heafty price.",1466208000,,800,4.082802547770701

8614003,5,B00FB6FT4U,"An look at three early Babymetal concerts when they were still deciding on numbers and the backing band. Fascinating to see the evolution. I wouldn't recommend this as your first Babymetal Blu-Ray (see Live at Budokan: Red Night), but it's a must have for fans.",1455580800,3,261,4.822222222222222
