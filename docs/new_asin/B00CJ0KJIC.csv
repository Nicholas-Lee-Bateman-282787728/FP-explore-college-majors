8582307,5,B00CJ0KJIC,"Wonderful film about the California Sea Otter and beautiful scenery of the California coast! Great way to learn about these amazing creatures, their struggle to survive and the fascinating rescue and release work the Monterey Bay Aquarium is doing through their SORAC (Sea Otter Research and Conservation) Program.  ""Otter 501"" really was #501!  I enjoyed watching her go from a stranded baby to learning everything she needs to know from a surrogate otter mom before her release to the wild.  Otter 501 Facebook just announced she had a pup of her own! What a success story!  If you love to watch otters, this is the film for you!",1366848000,5,631,4.814814814814815
