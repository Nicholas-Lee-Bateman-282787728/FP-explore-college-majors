8618792,5,B00FVXXC1A,"This DVD is a wonderful presentation of Mr. Hoar's style.  He paints different subjects and explains his thinking about his use of color. Mr. Hoar uses few brushes and a limited palette in his work.  This is not a ""how-to"" DVD for beginners but is quite useful if you want to try to loosen-up in your painting.  I admit to owning all his DVD's and look forward to the next.",1473552000,,373,4.3
