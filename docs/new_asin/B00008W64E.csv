1862899,5,B00008W64E,"This movie will make you take back the words ""too bad they don't make them like that anymore.""
If you've never heard of Patrick O'Brian's novels about Captain Jack Aubrey, a British naval captain of the Napoleonic era, and his ship's surgeon and friend Stephen Maturin, it will matter not one whit; Peter Weir has managed to make one of the most exciting movies of the year and surely one of the greatest ""adventure"" movies you'll ever see.  Aubrey's ship the ""HMS Surprise"" chases the enemy (French) ship Acheron around Cape Horn into the Pacific in hopes of capturing her.  Battles, chases, storms, strategy, tragic losses, medical miracles, and more battles ensue.  Although the movie is well over 2 hours long, there is not one soft spot in the narrative, it is a thrill from end to end.
Fans of the Aubrey/Maturin novels may have had a bit of the same anxiety as fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings:  what if the moviemakers wreck our beloved books?  Never fear; all positive expectations have been exceeded.  The crowd, the noise, the old scared able seamen and the boy midshipmen, the turbulence and fear, and the thrill of the novels are perfectly conveyed.
As Jack Aubrey, beefy, aggressive, Russell Crowe will surely never find a part for which he is better suited. Aubrey is an intuitive and brilliant captain.  Paul Bettany's Stephen Maturin is the perfect counterpoint:  thin and reserved, his caution serves as a natural restraint on Aubrey's recklessness.  Maturin is so disciplined a character that at one point he performs abdominal surgery on himSELF.
Some parents may feel it is a bit gory and glorifying for pre-teens, but for everyone else who loves adventure, this is the year's best ticket. (And now go read the books - you'll love them too!)",1068768000,6,1765,4.817880794701987
1862900,5,B00008W64E,"I strongly suspect that those of us who have read the entire Aubrey-Maturin series are going to think more highly of ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" than those landlubbers who have not worked their way through the two sea faring yarns written by Patrick O'Brian.  That is because Peter Weir has effectively translated the original novel to the screen.  By ""original novel"" I mean ""The Far Side of the World,"" because that is clearly the basis for this film and not the first volume in the series, ""Master and Commander.""  By ""effectively translated"" I fully take into account that the conflict is now between Jack Aubrey's H.M.S. Surprise and a French frigate during the Napoleonic War rather than with an American vessel during the War of 1812, that the entire subplot regarding Stephen Maturin's spy mission has been omitted, and that Stephen is suddenly a lot taller than Jack.  The attention here is to the spirit of the novels rather than the letter.  Given what Hollywood has so often done to beloved literary works, we are way ahead of the game with what we can only hope is the first in a series of films with these characters (at least until we get to my favorite scene in the series, when Jack is pilloried in ""The Reverse of the Medal"").
The story of ""The Far Side of the World"" essentially begins after the start and ends before the ending, which is not unusual in a Patrick O'Brian novel.  The Surprise is off of Brazil and we are privy to Aubrey's orders, which are to engage the French privateer Acheron and prevent the enemy vessel from sailing around Cape Horn and start raiding British whalers in the Pacific.  The only problem is that the French ship is not only bigger and faster but has more guns that shoot farther, while the volleys from Surprise bounce off the Acheron's sides.  The mismatch is proven in an initial engagement that is almost a complete disaster.  Discretion might demand the Surprise limp back to England for repairs, but ""Lucky"" Jack has his orders.  Jack insists it is the call of duty while Stephen dares to suggest it might be pride, but the result is the same.
The result is that ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is a chase film that runs over two hours (forget about looking at your watch and watch the movie).  The pursuer and the pursued change at critical times in the film, and there are uncomfortable lulls when sailors and surgeons can take deep breaths, all the while keeping an eye on the horizon to spot enemy sails.  But ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey will bide his time to prove the maximum about lucky being the residue of hard work, such as gunnery practice, and inspiration provided by his particular friend and a young midshipman.  My only serious complaint about the film has to do with the rampant jump cuts during the climactic battle, but still there are a couple of things you have never seen in a film about a naval engagement that are rather impressive when you realize that fact.
Still, those of us who have read the O'Brian novels have the weather gage in this encounter, because the names of Killick, Padeen, Bonden, and Pullings all mean something to us and the richness of the supporting cast enhances the film even for the uninitiated.  Crowe effortlessly embodies Aubrey, and if O'Brian had lived to see this film he would not have regretted that this film was not made in in the previous century when his ideal choice for the role, Charlton Heston, could have essayed the role.  The choice of Paul Bettany will be the one that will trouble the purists, but it seems clear that Weir and co-writer John Collee wanted their Maturin to be more of a match for Aubrey.  To this end he is no longer oblivious of what is happening on the ship and apparently gets from ship to shore and back again without falling into the ocean.  Towards this same end there is a moment when readers of the novels expect Jack to dive into the ocean to save another able bodied seaman, but the film wants to make a very different point.  It might not be gospel, but it rings true in the moment, which is the greatest testament this film could pay to O'Brian and his readers.",1068768000,7,4149,4.561238223418574
1862901,5,B00008W64E,"As a Patrick O'Brian fan for nearly ten years, I had some doubts about a movie whose title combined the titles of two of the Aubrey-Maturin series.
My doubts have been laid to rest.  This movie is not simply an adaptation of one book; it is a beautifully filmed overview of the first half of the series, written to have a straightforward plot accessable to someone not already conversant with O'Brian.  I think anyone with an interest in age-of-sail fiction will appreciate seeing ship handling on the big screen.
It is not perfect -- I noticed that, for example, there seemed to be no lookouts at the masthead, and Captain Aubrey's chest was bared more often than would be seemly.  But it is the best movie of Napoleonic-era naval fiction that I have seen.",1068768000,40,757,4.634328358208955
1862902,5,B00008W64E,"Just Terrific!  This film by Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) reminded me of why I love 'the movies'... something I was beginning to forget.  The action is the by far the best representation of naval warfare I've ever seen - blowing ""Pirates of the Carribean"" squarely out of the water.  Still, the naval battles don't overshadow the human story.  I've never read any of O'Brian's novels, but I've heard his historic accuracy is astonishing and Director Weir has done him justice.
Particulary moving is the bravery shown by the ship's many Midshipmen (boys who were being trained to become future officers), who could not have been older than 13, yet still had to deal with life & death struggle.
I was blown away by how moving and exciting this film was.  It will be interesting to see if this years' mega-movie (Return of the King) can measure up to Master and Commander.",1068768000,,872,4.7105263157894735
1862903,5,B00008W64E,"MASTER AND COMMANDER is one of those Hollywood, old-style swashbuckling epics produced just for the fun (and expected profit) of it. It's without any touchy-feely social agenda, tiresome political correctness, or warm and fuzzy lessons of the ""I'm ok; you're ok"" ilk. I loved it!
Russell Crowe is Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, commanding His Britannic Majesty's fighting ship, the 28-gun Surprise. It's 1805, England is at war (again!) with the French, and Aubrey is ordered to  the waters off Brazil to take out a marauding French privateer, the Acheron. Within the first 20 minutes, the Surprise is ambushed in the fog by the Acheron, and barely escapes. We never find out why Jack is called ""Lucky"", but we do learn that he's a generally victorious commander. So, it's not unexpected that he takes this defeat badly, and spends the rest of the film stalking the much larger (40+ guns) and more modern French vessel.
The focus of M&C is on Aubrey and his friendship with the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who's the only one aboard with the license to tell the Captain when he's lost perspective. And, one of the film's most interesting aspects is its depiction of the at-sea, combat surgery of the time. It's not a visit to your friendly HMO.
Perhaps the most intriguing character, beyond Aubrey, is that of Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), a boy of perhaps 10 or 11 years, who loses an arm in the first engagement with the Acheron. Viewers may be surprised to learn that such youngsters served in the Royal Navy during that period. You grew into a man in short order. The performance by young Pirkis may merit an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
Accustomed as we are to fast police chases on the evening news, it's revealing to see the nature of ocean pursuits in the days of sail. It sometimes took many, many hours for one ship to overtake another to the point of being within firing range. And, when it does, all hell breaks loose. In the low-ceilinged gun deck, the seaman must dodge recoiling cannons, while managing not to slip on the blood-slick, pitching deck nor concuss his head on the overhead.
It must be noted that there are no significant female roles in M&C. At one point, 4 working girls appear in a skiff beside a re-victualing Surprise, but they're gone without speaking after merely seconds of screen time. This is all about Guys bonding, playing sailor, going without baths, and swinging sharp blades.
Near the end of the film, Captain Jack exhorts his men to do their duty ""for England"" and ""the prize"". While the last is, in context, the Acheron, Twentieth Century Fox may see it as the Best Picture Oscar. A reasonable bet is that MASTER AND COMMANDER will take it by storm, with Crowe garnering Best Actor.

1862960,5,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" adapts material from several of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series of novels set during the Napoleonic Wars. In doing so, writers Peter Weir & John Collee and director Peter Weir craft a story that's accessible for those who haven't read the book while including plenty of nice references for O'Brian fans. Russell Crowe as Capt. Jack Aubrey, Paul Bettany as Dr. Stephen Maturin, and James D'Arcy as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings are great as their respective characters with others admirably adding to the ensemble cast.
20th Century Fox released this film in 2003 and, fifteen years later, appears unlikely to adapt any of the other 19 novels. This is sadly unfortunate as the film has the right blend of action, comedy, and drama amid a faithfully reproduced historical setting. O'Brian was a stickler for historical details and this film captures that spirit. Most movies would avoid using real ships in favor of CGI, but this films real things whenever possible, which adds to the overall quality. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a treat and check it out.",1518480000,2,1110,4.9411764705882355
1862961,5,B00008W64E,"I got this Blu-ray to replace the DVD my brother-in-law can't find to give back to me. About the only thing that bothers me is their nautical semantics. Half the time someone yells ""starboard"" (right side of the boat), they really mean ""port"" or left side of the boat. I guess the writers thought the former descriptive sounded better. Otherwise it's a great adventure.

The other thing I didn't like was redeeming the digital HD file. Some of these movie companies let you redeem it through iTunes which permits you to actually download a copy of the movie to play in places where you don't have broadband. Master and Commander isn't one of those movies, instead pushing you to Movies Anywhere which makes you redeem it off their server to stream in real time. Movies Anywhere advertises it works with iTunes but only to the extent you upload your DRM file so they know which movies you already own, and then allowing you to watch their copy off their server.",1518393600,,960,4.647058823529412

All of the film type attributes and acting attributes of this movie have already been outlined by the previous posters, but I will take a different ""tack""  ( no pun intended ), and point out that for model ship builders, this is  an almost overwhelmingly realistic look at the ships of this period.

It is almost as if someone shrunk you and put  you right inside one of your models:  it is all there: every rope, mast, spar, etc and more....I don't know exactly what ship they used to film most of the scenes, but it must have been a fully restored model of this period type.

Right now , I am currently working on a very large version of the HMS Victory, which of course, was Admiral Nelson's flagship, who is highly looked up to and praised in this movie, although he does not appear in the movie.  As someone who puts a lot of research and effort into the rigging of the ship, I can tell you that the producers of this movie definitely did their homework, and it is just astonishing how true to the period all of it is.

since seeing in the cinema when it was doing the rounds...have to say, the film is even better than i remember it
to be...certainly glad i finally took the cellophane cover off and watched it again after all these years.
The high-seas adventure is adapted from a series of three novels Patrick O'Brian Aubrey telling of Jack Aubrey's
naval career. (He'd seved under Admiral Nelson as a young officer)
In 1805 during the Napoleonic-Wars Captain Jack Aubrey played by Russell Crowe is ordered to pursue, sink or
capture the French privateer war-ship 'Acheron' a vessel that hugely outgunned and out-manned the British war-
ship 'H.M.S Surprise' ...it was also a lot faster.
After an encounter leaves 'Surprise' badly damaged, the ship, in fog, is towed away from danger by rowing-boats
by it's crew.
The 'Surprise' is no match for the French war-ship, yet, the determined Captain orders it's repair with the intent of
continuing the pursuit regardless of cost, knowing that if the 'Acheron' is allowed to plunder the British Whaling-Ships
the balance of power in the war could turn in 'Napoleon's' favour.
The pursuit will take them around the treacherous waters of Cape Horn into the wide expanses of the Pacific Ocean,
upon reaching the 'Galapagos Islands' where the Captain believes the 'Acheron' will hit-out from he promises ships
Doctor and close friend 'Stephen Maturin' (Paul Bettany) who has interest in rare plant and creature form the Islands
are renowned for, time to investigate.
However they pick-up survivors of a Whaling-Ship sunk by the French Ship, realising it to be close 'Captain Aubrey'
orders an immediate resumption of the pursuit, obviously his friend is disappointed not to have been given the chance
to study the unusual life on the Islands.
However fate will take a turn when the Doctor is accidentally shot, and needs to have firm ground to remove the bullet
before his health fails....after operating on himself and given the fact he was taken back to the Galapagos by his friend
to save his life, the opportunity to investigate the Island once he regains strength turns in the Doctors favour.
However, the investigation is short-lived as the French Vessel is spotted anchored on the other side of  the Island, duty
comes first, the Captain now has to determined how to outwit the French-Ships captain and turn the tide in his favour
despite the odds.
Many a friend and ships companion will fall before the task and duty is done.
With a superb cast, the feel of life during those tough times sailing the Oceans and facing the enemy in battle, the film truly
is well worth a re-visit or indeed a first viewing.

The portrayal of a Napoleonic War era British frigate and its crew in action is excellent as is the cinematography. It falls short of 5 stars only because the characters, other than Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) are thinly developed.

Nitpicks: The title is taken from the first novel in the series, which would make an outstanding stand-alone movie by itself, while the story is taken from the tenth novel in the series, ""Far Side of the World"". Bits and pieces of the story and dialogue are taken from several other novels in the series.

Darwin- the Galapagos Islands- life in 1803- are depicted and so it's quite educational; my 16 year old grandson loved this movie.  Nothing- anyone can not watch.

1863200,4,B00008W64E,"Four SWASHBUCKLING Stars! ""Master and Commander-The Far Side of the World"" is a seafaring movie about the British ship ""HMS Surprise"" which is surprised itself in 1805 by a ""mystery ship"" in the Atlantic around Brazil. Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Abrey wants desperately to find it and sink or take it. A crewman luckily sees the ship and identifies it so Abrey knows what he is facing. Will he follow his orders or not? The movie's title ""Master and Commander"" seems much overblown since the movie is only concerned with two ships, not flotillas of them. Nonetheless, the movie appears to be very realistic. With great cinematography, especially the opening shot where a seaman goes through various sections of the ship with only a lantern, the battles also appear to be realistic from on board and shot from out at sea. This is a very well done movie within the scope of its subject matter. Russell Crowe as Lucky Jack is fabulous. Also starring Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Chris Larkin, Max Pirkis, Jack Randall, Robert Pugh, Ian Mercer, and Thierry Segall. Directed by Peter Weir. Very Definitely Recommended.

1863206,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander holds a special place in my memory. Having seen it multiple times in theaters alone, I can safely say that its only real glaring flaw is the timing of its release. It was nominated for 10 Academy awards and lost the bulk of them to The Return of the King. While I do love LotR, I still firmly believe this movie could have claimed best picture had it not been forced to compete with Jackson's masterpiece. Why, however is where it gets interesting.

Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, it follows the story of the captain and crew of the HMS Surprise, a frigate in the royal navy tasked with hunting down a powerful French Privateer Acheron, intent on carrying the war into the Pacific. However the French ship turns out to be much larger and more advanced than the Surprise and the Surprise and her crew find themselves in a lopsided battle against a superior ship and a seemingly impossible task of taking her. Still, Captain Jack Aubrey of the Surprise will stop at nothing to complete the mission.

Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is the atmosphere. It simply oozes it. This is one of the few films that can literally take you to another place and time. It feels less like you're watching a film and more like you're watching what some time travelers recorded on a trip back to 1805. It also holds the record for the most realistic depiction of Napoleonic Wars era naval warfare. The battles are brutal slug matches and the hand combat is just as savage. The first 20 minutes of the film have sequences a step below Saving Private Ryan. If the opening sequence doesn't grab you then this film just isn't for you.",1466899200,9,1661,4.551839464882943

1863303,5,B00008W64E,"This is one of the best movies ever made. Perhaps the best period. It shows a fine epic of naval warfare that is well worth the watch.
There are few things bad to say about it. The special effects are splendid and well crafted. The plot is great and the characters are sympathetic. It is a sophisticated movie-one which will not patronize over you with a lowest common denominator appeal. On the contrary it exercises the mind as well as stirring the heart  with discussions of nautical technology, sailor folklore, music both classical and folk, and even a smattering of philosophy. But it also has as much action as any movie, without the action being stupid or cartoonish.

 It has no sex(except a couple bawdy jokes). There is little swearing. The violence is as much as needed but it is not sadism porn, nor does it deceive anyone into thinking that violence is not real. It needs none of those things. It reminds people that war is not a game, but not by superfluous gore, but by showing tragedy. It does not ""glorify war""; it glorifies heroism. It needs none of these crude attractions and is to fine a movie to stoop to them.

It is a very good movie for young people, for it shows friendship, honor, leadership, and a masculinity that need not be barbaric to be manly. And it shows boys growing up in an adult setting and looking for men to emulate. A boy can identify with one of the young midshipmen and be improved rather then degraded. Yet it will appeal to his natural emotions by showing how to harness them rather then repressing them or giving in to them.  If he desires a role model and desires to imagine himself a hero this will go far toward showing those things in a healthy way.  And if it strains the mind a bit it strains it no more then needs to be strained. It is an intelligent movie but not an overrefined one and it is a great display of the kind of tale that has always stirred humanity when done well. As I said it shows tragedy but tragedy is not the dominant theme. Heroism is.

It is also realistic. The hardships of life at sea and the horrors of Napoleonic warfare are shown well. Combat scenes look just real enough to strike home. Splinters fly when shot hits the ship, and hand-to-hand fighting bears little resemblance to Errol Flynn.  And there are few historical errors and those can be tolerated.

All in all it is a terrific movie and should be watched. And watched again.",1462233600,65,2417,4.450226244343892

1863307,5,B00008W64E,"It is unfortunate that the producers of this film did not believe in this first film to bring out the second. Master and Commander was brilliant;ly researched, with some of the best age of sail scenes ever filmed, accurate to a fault. Sea battles in the time of Napolean were not for the faint hearted, as the engaged men-of-war were mere yards from each other blasting full broadsides to devastating effect on both hulls and the men inside them. Life onboard was rough and spartan, weeks- or month-long periods of abject boredom with brief interludes of pure terror when action finally took place against an enemy. Russell Crowe takes to his role as Commanding Officer of Her Majesty's Royal Navy man of war with an intensity and stature totally in keeping with the times, and the actors portraying the officers and men under him each have a personality which makes them memorable individuals.

""Master and Commander"" is the best naval war action movie of the Napoleonic War over the global ocean.

But the action isn't everything we get to see in the film. We get to see and admire the pride and professionalism from the Captain Jack AUBREY's seamanship along with the passion of Dr. Stephen MATURIN, not only as a doctor, but as a naturalist before the time of Charles DARWIN and his ""Origin of Species."" Meanwhile, we also get to see and sympathize the sailors' harsh life on board.

The characters' names were made up by the writer Patrick O'BRIAN, but so many of these people really existed in our history. The history wasn't only built by Emperor Napoleon BONAPARTE or Admiral Horatio NELSON, but by all these people who did their job in their place.

The movie helps us understand how our modern world was built when we see these voyagers challenge to sail deep into the <<far side of the world>> naming their new world in their old language and perspective, so that we now live in the very world these very people created.

The movie describes all these very well in precise detail with each individual's point of view. It's fascinating!",1461110400,,1345,4.682203389830509

1863458,5,B00008W64E,"BRILLIANT! I was very favourably surprised by this film. It is one of the best movies ever made about war on seas in the age of sail. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

May 1805, Napoleonic Wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe, remarkable!) of HMS ""Surprise"" is ordered to pursue the French privateer ""Acheron"", and ""sink, burn, or take her as a prize."" We enter in the story at full speed, as both ships meet in the first minute. It turns out that ""Acheron"", far from being a simple privateer, is in fact a heavy frigate. It is also revealed that she managed to enter the southern Atlantic without being noticed because Napoleon purchased her from Americans  sailing from USA with her French crew she easily avoided British patrols, focused on French coasts

American built ""Acheron"" is brand new and her design represents the nec plus ultra in naval construction (her hull is stronger, her battery more powerful and yet she is faster than HMS ""Surprise""), which makes her a formidable adversary for the smaller and especially older British light frigate. Shocked by the first encounter, Aubrey nevertheless decides to carry his mission, as this mighty French vessel can inflict terrible damage to British commercial shipping and whaling fleet. If necessary, HMS ""Surprise"" will follow ""Acheron"" to infinity  and beyond And then the film really begins.

The story of this long and dramatic sea chase makes for a great movie, masterfully directed by experienced veteran Peter Weir. The budget was generous (150 million dollars) and we can see the result on the screen. The scenario is strong and keeps surprising us - we cannot guess how it will all end We get to know the men serving on HMS ""Surprise"" and start to care about them, which makes the film even more interesting.

I must admit with shame that I never read any books about Jack Aubrey adventures, therefore I am unable to make any comparisons between the film and the novels. It is however worth mentioning that in the book, the action took place during Second Independence War (1812-1814) and Jack Aubrey's antagonist was an American vessel, USS ""Norfolk"". Peter Weir preferred however to replace her with a French frigate, in order to not antagonize US viewers change 

I was quite impressed by Peter Weir portrayal of life and warfare on sea in the great age of sail. They are shown I believe rather faithfully, with all their cruelty but also with all their rough and grim beauty. HMS ""Surprise crew lives a tough life, full of back breaking labour, with danger omnipresent, death lurking from every corner  with the added ""bonus"" of ferocious discipline, atrocious food and poor sleeping arrangements. Nevertheless, people who live, serve, fight and die on HMS ""Surprise"" are shown like a band of brothers from ""Henry V"". They are of course all submitted to the all-powerful master and commander but with Jack Aubrey being a good leader, this is actually a more or less willing arrangement (even if some people were probably pressed into the service). A more politically correct director could easily show the HMS ""Surpirse"" as a floating hell populated by slaves and ruled by a barbarian tyrant  but I believe Peter Weir's vision is closer to reality. Life on sail ships in Napoleonic Wars was a very, very tough thing, but it was not even remotely as bad as before the great mutinies of Spithead and Nore in 1797. Also, ever since the terrible mutiny on HMS ""Hermione"" in the same year, the worst abuses by commanding officers were frowned upon and as result leadership quality improved. Officers still had of course to be very tough and in this film it is shown very well, that those who were not tough enough and/or failed to maintain distance between them and simple sailors fared poorly  very poorly indeed

There is a little bit of ""Moby Dick"" in this film, as the relentless pursuit of Great Bad French Frigate by Jack Aubrey starts to turn at one moment into a quasi-achabian obsession. However HMS ""Surprise"" is not the ""Pequod"" and Aubrey's actions are actually logical  he IS after all under imperious direct orders to catch ""Acheron"" and ""sink, burn or take her as a prize"". This is also a very masculine film, with some anonymous women appearing only in one short glimpse  on another hand it shows a very beautiful friendship, between Jack Aubrey and ship's surgeon, doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, excellent). All this, together with some very tough action scenes, makes ""Master and Commander"" into a movie mostly for guys I think.

I could certainly say a lot more about this film, but I will stop here, to avoid more spoilers. I was impressed by ""Master and commander"" and I completely cannot understand why it didn't fare better at box office. I would be delighted to see a sequel (after all there twenty books in the Aubrey-Maturin series) but sadly I don't think it will ever happen I rented this film, but I think I will buy it one day, because it is worth not only to see more than once but also to be kept on the shelf.

1863477,1,B00008W64E,"I don't understand why people consider this movie of high quality, or why it was rated highly on Rotten Tomatoes and iMDB.  Beyond excellent cinematography, there are no plaudits to hand out.  No character development beyond banal intercourse leading in circles and certainly any subordinate relationships among characters aside from the Captain and Doctor are not fleshed out to any substantial degree.  A ship chases a ship...any allegory there is pretty blunt but fairly nonexistent even a vaguely esoteric way.  No metaphors to speak of in any real way either, and Russel Crowe's Captain Jack is just plain boring.  There is nothing special about him save a reputation for being lucky, and apparently knowing captain stuff that I imagine most captains would know.  He gets fooled 2/3 times, for goodness sake.  For God and Country is essentially the driving force of the movie - again, no more than a ship chasing a ship - and there's no substantial examination aside from Paul Bettany's Doctor as to why this pursuit may be selfishly motivated by Crowe.  This lack of onscreen reflection leads to it being a non-issue, which actually would have been interesting in a larger debate.  No one, so sailor questions what is happening.  The battle scenes are tame and not impressive nor exciting - Pirates of the Caribbean did those much better, amazingly - and the Galapagos scenes are overlong and ineffective due to their blatant attempt at establishing some counterbalance to life at sea.  The obvious references to Darwin within the characters (the boy who is sort of nameless and the Doctor) don't amount to anything and really don't add anything to the film.  The captured animals are released and the good Doc has just the boy's drawings left.  Pretty much the movie in a nutshell...we see something and but we actually have no more than a rendering of anything real.  The entire film I waited for the point or at least some fun and excitement, and it never came.  It was a beautifully shot movie about nothing that I can't describe more accurately than very boring.  Well acted by Crowe in a limited character, Bettany was a bit annoying, I think Perigrine Took was in there, but what a colossal waste of money in an obviously expensive effort.  Like Last of the Mohicans (an exceedingly better film), perhaps the French perspective would have been more interesting.  In Master and Commander, frankly anything would have been an improvement.  A movie about next to nothing, with no character development, with boring scenes throughout and tame-to-banal battles, complete with underdeveloped supporting actors and an anticlimactic ending that was obvious from the start - all this makes for a waste of two hours.  Pretty disappointing.  From me to you, skip it and watch a rerun of oh, how about a blank TV screen?  Any movement you see in the reflection is more excitement than Master and Commander could muster.",1450828800,2,2920,4.940573770491803

It is a rollicking good tale, beautifully filmed, acted, gives you the feeling that you're there on the ship and living like British sailors (and the ship's doctor who is a naturalist as well) did back in the early 19th Century.

The captain (Russell Crowe) is following a French warship that's raising havoc with British shipping in the south Atlantic and the Pacific.  He won't give up and won't turn back until he sinks it or takes her as a prize.

Someone said it was outstanding script, actors, and a director; however, I think there is something else. It could be the wish to want to be there at that time. Since my ancestors did board a ship, it makes me have more questions than answers. I did feel watching it that I was there, then to come to the sudden realization that I am and was not. I feel like I get to know the lowly ship hands, as if I could, in a way impossible, otherwise. So far I am nearing the second book in the series. There really was a hierarchical structure between the captain, the shipmates, and the officers. It was very different than anything else. They were loyal to the king and England. When I come out of this, I feel like it would be nice to be there in the ongoing time. I have always wanted to have the experience for years and years. There were many things I would say to Captain Jack Aubrey had I been there. I must say at the end I was sad to see so many lost and the captain to be gone.

1863661,5,B00008W64E,"There is something about a well-done film that is often taken for granted. You sit in your seat and allow the film to take you away and for approximately 2 hours, you are taken to another world, to a group of people you don't know, to places you have never been, and into situations you could scarcely imagine. And for these two hours, you are enveloped in this world, forgetting for a moment that you are not really there, only experiencing illusory images on a screen. Good movies do this to you. But it all depends upon an outstanding script, convincing actors, realistic sets, and superb direction. If any of these pieces are weak, the cinematic experience is compromised. Luckily, Master and Commander has all of the elements in spades. Instead of watching a movie, you feel you have boarded a military naval vessel at the very beginning of the 19th century. Your ship is loyal to England. And your commander is Jack Aubrey, played with stunning realism by Russell Crowe.

Based on the novel by Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander begins right in the middle of the action. It is as if the viewer suddenly woke up on a late 18th-century naval vessel amidst the conflict between Britain and Napoleon Bonaparte. You see the workings of the crew, their tasks, and their relationships. You see the hierarchical structure, from lowly ship hand to the officers and the captain. And, most stunningly of all, you experience being out on the wide open seas just south of the Caribbean islands along the eastern coast of South America.

You mostly get to know the HMS Surprise's captain, Jack Aubrey (Crowe), and his struggles between his duty to and orders from the Crown of England and his love and responsibility for his crew. He must manage these interests while trying to capture the fastest ship known to the world in service to Napoleon Bonaparte. And of course, he can't allow the French to defeat him in combat, and he can't lose his ship at the hands of the French, other foes, or the destructive power of the sea. Aubrey is like the juggler at the circus, his hands juggling his men and orders, while his ship is balanced on his nose.

The film begins in 1805 with the HMS Surprise and its crew sprinting down the coast of South America. They are in hot pursuit of the French's prize possession, the Acheron, which can out-gun and outrun the English ship. Fighting erupts, momentarily crippling the Surprise. The officers suggest finding a port, but Aubrey does not want to lose sight of his prey. The story becomes episodic as it chronicles the conflict between these two titan vessels. Softening the stern objective sensibility of Aubrey is a naturalist-doctor, Stephen Maturin, who serves as both the ship's surgeon and an enlightenment-style scientist who wants to study biology off the coast of the Galapagos Islands. But not even science can stand in the way of war and military conflict. Or might it be his ally?

As usual, Crowe's performance is outstanding as he finds that subtle area where he is a compassionate and yet hard-nosed commander with a touch of wit and humor. Maybe slightly ideal, but we tend to run with it. Peter Weir's direction is masterful in the sense that he purposefully avoids drawing attention to itself. His goal is to give you this story without breaking new ground in cinematic technique which could distract from the unfolding of the epic drama. He wants to tell you a story on the high seas, not comment on the skill of ""directing"". And that is the mark of a truly great director.

The relationship between the script, the actors, the setting and the director appears seamless. The action and the drama both coincide in such a way as to be believable without it getting too sentimental. Everything is seen from point of view of the ship mates, which keeps the viewer honed in on a particular point of view which appears to be by design. The story wants the viewer to take on the hopes and dreams, the prejudices, the hates and the fears of the crew. Whether or not it is moral or immoral to play war with the French is not the point. Rather, the filmmakers want you to understand the conflict from the English perspective. This is the kind of film-making that succeeds upon just about every conceivable level. I think Crowe makes an excellent Captain Aubrey, and would like him to recapitulate the role and make further O'Brian stories. A high-mark of pure cinematic entertainment.",1432684800,2,4427,4.721862871927555

Every time I put this movie ""on"", I do so thinking, ""Meh, another night with Russell Crowe"" - heck, I've seen this movie five or six times. One starts to think, ""There is no possible way this movie will still be good."" Die hard fans of the book series will weigh in on both sides; however, the movie is good enough that even series fans will say something like, ""Just as I imagined it!"" in reviewing ""Master and Commander"". Here's my take: every time - without exaggeration - I am blown away by this (fictional) story of friendship during the Napoleonic wars amidst such an iconic setting for the era. The cinematography, the research (thanks to the author of the series), and the acting lend to a truly moving action film - one that is indeed at times hard to watch.

1863693,5,B00008W64E,"The defining characteristic that sets ""Master and Commander"" apart as one of the best films of its kind is authenticity. Viewers are transported completely into a world aboard a British frigate, HMS Surprise, during the Napoleonic wars in the age of sail. Enthusiasts of historical naval fiction will warm to the detail in everything from weevil-ridden biscuits to wardroom banter about the weather gage.

The story, adapted from the novels of Patrick O'Brian, is essentially a cat-and-mouse adventure on the high seas involving HMS Surprise and her illusive French adversary, Acheron. It's the sort of film in which, thankfully, the action supports the story and not the other way round. Plentiful battle scenes, with ""broadsides"" and boarding parties, are balanced against a sensitive humanity in the friendship between the audacious and resourceful Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and the ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), a compassionate scientist.

Peter Weir's experienced directing brings out interesting questions on the nature of duty, the importance of scientific inquiry and the value of human life while never allowing the film to wallow in sentimentality or moral philosophy. It is a balanced approach which allows for believable character development from a fine screenplay. Weir's singular ability to create atmosphere is also exhibited to good effect here, whether it be an eerie creaking of timbers as the ""Jonah"" walks the deck at night or the emergence of a ghostly enemy vessel from a fog bank.

Other highlights are the classical music which includes the beautifully poignant Tallis Fantasia by Ralph Vaughan Williams and spectacular footage of the Galapagos Islands, the first time the Ecuadorean authorities had allowed them to be photographed for a feature film.

While it will be of particular interest to those familiar with the works of O'Brian, Alexander Kent and C.S. Forrester there is something for most tastes in this production except perhaps fans of the romantic love affair. It should not disappoint.",1427673600,,2060,5.388198757763975

My only regret is that they played with the story so much, trying to compact several novels into one that they lost something of the essence. As long as I'm being ""picky"", the casting was a problem. Jack Aubrey is supposed to be very tall and broad, weighing about 240 pounds. Stephen Maturin is supposed to about average height for the time give or take an inch either way. Also, slightly built. Paul Bettany is larger than Russell Crowe. Despite having the character bent or sitting much of the time, it's obvious and distracting.

1863730,1,B00008W64E,"I love the book series, so I'm probably already biased against the film...

I think Russell Crowe was a terrible casting job for the main character.  Not only is Jack described repeatedly as Very Blond (Goldilocks is his nickname) and Russell far Too Dark headed, but he's also Regularly described as Noticeably Overweight...  I would love to have seen John Goodman (or similar) play Jack, as he's also meant to be a powerful and larger-than-life man...  Crowe plays him not only too subdued, but also a bit too 'clever' in a day to day sense...  Jack is meant to be a bit of a bumbler socially, and has a love of puns a bit beyond that of a wry man, but he is a genius seaman and naval tactician...  the two are Meant to play off of each other...  a jolly man, something of a bull in a china shop, but a firm and fast decision maker in his trade...  like a man who has learned his craft from boyhood, but somehow missed the social upbringing to be witty and clever among the city society folk...

Stephen Maturin, the series' other main character, is also sadly miscast...  'the doctor' as he is called, is regularly referenced as being a man that looks indeterminately Old and wizened...  he is foreign in nature to the English crew and is distinctly withdrawn into his science and naturalizing to the point of being impractical and distinctly absent minded...  he is described as unattractive and even nearly ugly in the sense that he does not care for his appearance, gets far too much sun, and wears old threadbare clothes all the time...  Again, Hollywood decided to replace him with someone distinctly too young and 'pretty'...  they even fail to have him wear his somewhat ridiculous worn out powdered wig all of the time...  and his rapport with Jack is distinctly lacking in the film...  he regularly makes naval faux pas and puts his foot in his mouth in the novels, and none of that is successfully presented.  By failing to represent his dottiness and clumsy social skills, he just comes off as a snobbish jerk, to my mind.

Add to that the overall youth of the crew, admittedly historically younger, but simply cast far too 'pretty' for the lifestyle as it is presented in the most excellent novels.  Endless sun, salt, surf, poor diet, rum, and hard labor at ropes all night long would make for a crew more along the lines of your usual 'pirate' standard...  not necessarily crippled, but distinctly 'weathered'...

Inaccurate as that was, I found the overall Acting and countenance of the crew not only silly, but a bit Insulting in the film...  The books make it quite clear that the life is hard, and storms and battles are rough, but the men of that time were very much Hardened to it and would Not cringe and cry in fear as they are portrayed in the film...  the Surprise (Not the first ship of the books) was, in fact, manned with a Seasoned crew of Experienced man-of-war's men...  they did Not get Seasick, or get weepy during a storm...  they knew the hardships of the sea, and were stoical and strong...  Any member of the captains crew so quick to give up, claim total destruction, and failure in all endeavors would have been kicked to the curb, or never made to rise as far as they are seen to be...  to watch the actors winge and whimper is just silly...  (somebody slap that man!)

Which, to make things all the worse, brings us to the complete shambles that is the story itself.  Among a series of 21 most excellent novels, there are countless battles, and the first book itself is full of events worthy of a film, but it seems that the writers put the first half dozen novels in a blender and poured out a chopped up mess of quips and quotes with complete disregard to the Reality that the books are so well known for, and do so well.  Oh, let's put in the cheap jokes, but disregard the plot line, history, and every single story as presented...
Even the title is a mishmash of more than one book title!

As a final failure, the film is full of pathetic attempts at the proper accents and slang terms of the seamen.  A language known the world over which itself has spawned linguistic subsections all over the globe, the complete lack of ability to capture that very distinct reality just made even the dialogue impossible to abide.

This film seems to have come and gone without much ado...  and I think we can safely say they will not be picking it up again anytime soon...  this is sad because the books are among the best writing of its sort ever made, but with the complete failure of this adaptation, I am sad to say I would rather see it wither and die.",1424217600,5,4593,4.478365384615385

1863738,5,B00008W64E,"Have to say I am an avid sail boat sailor and had a career in the U. S. Navy Submarine Force as Navigator.  Therefore, Ive a prejudice in favor of this film.

I am also an avid movie fan.  The actors portray their characters in a truthful, revealing manner that makes it possible to believe in them and care about them.  The story is compels you into the world of an 1805 British Naval fighting ship of the line and encourages you to suspend any notion of disbelief such that, you go along with exuberance and join some of the best drama and action that a cast and story can tell.

An excellent story as told by an excellent cast.

The other disc about the making of the movie is recommended to be seen first especially if you've little knowledge about what it takes to crew and sail a sailing ship of the line of the 1800s.  Then, there are rewards of background understanding as you watch this excellent cast show you an excellent story.

My opinion is, the opening has held me a willing prisoner ever since my first viewing, therefore, I highly recommend this movie.  Enjoy.",1423526400,3,1077,4.398989898989899
1863739,2,B00008W64E,"The main problem I had was the absence of good characters with whom I could form an emotional attachment. For example, I had no clue who the man washed overboard (Warley) was. Similarly, I wanted to feel something for the officer who committed suicide (The Jonah), but never was given enough to sympathize with. As the main character, Russell Crowe was supposed to carry this film, but delivered a one-dimensional portrayal.

As a result, the movie comes off emotionally flat with far too much time spent on battle and storm scenes.

By contrast, I recommend Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951) starring Gregory Peck or Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982).",1423267200,,654,4.9363636363636365

1863745,4,B00008W64E,"This movie won an Oscar for cinematography but what caught my attention was the astounding sound quality. During the opening battle with the Acheron, cannon balls rumble and buzz and rip like the whole damned sea battle is happening right in your own living room. I'll agree with other people in that the period detail is also meticulously recreated. Everything looks and sounds great.

Russell Crowe succeeds in his role as Jack Aubrey. You'll be reminded of his performance in Gladiator, but his acting here is no repeat. Besides, he's good at playing charismatic military leaders.

The movie is a little disappointing because all the ads and press made it out to be an exciting, action-filled ocean adventure movie. It is not. Director Peter Weir's recreation of period detail slows the pace of the movie because he takes extra time to show all the preparation that goes into an old-fashioned sea battle. If you've seen other Peter Weir movies, you'll know that he likes to ponder philosophical themes and this movie is no exception. There is a lengthy stop in the Galapagos Islands and some talk about evolution that obviously meant something to Weir, but I'm not sure what it has to do with the rest of the movie.

Setting artistic considerations aside, I definitely recommend this Blu-ray disc on the grounds of technical merit. Visual and sound quality are excellent, visual effects awesome, and performances from all actors are excellent. You won't find many edge-of-your-seat thrills here, but you will find astonishment and awe at just what Hollywood and your home theatre system can do.",1421539200,,1597,4.996240601503759

1863762,5,B00008W64E,"I am dissapointed to find so many 4 star reviews from people who clearly loved this movie, and particularly from those to whom this visual and audio masterpiece has granted an eyewitness account (unmatched in my estimation) of life aboard His Majesty's ships during the Napoleonic Era - the last days of truly great seamanship, according to one Horatio Hornblower.

This movie, as others have noted, does not strictly follow any one book, but contains elements of a few books from the Patrick O'brien series. While I understand the motives of some taking a star or two away from this movie due to the variance between it and the books, I think it is preferable, and more reasonable to rate the movie as a story in itself.

As such, I cannot but grant this movie 5 stars (4.8). There are several elements found herein which are the core of great story telling. Within its two and a half hours, the directors and screenwriters manage to cast considerable light on the characters, many of whom you will become quite fond. The visuals are immersive yet smooth (unlike many of the battle scenes from Gladiator or Band of Brother's - where a constantly shaky camera and 1-2 second shot perspectives require less orchestration and finesse).

The story is one of duty. There is some dynamism to the main character, but not so much to think him irresolute concerning the cause of Britain against the Tyrant Napoleon (who happily makes no appearance in this movie). There is no emotional roller coaster. There aren't a multitude of surprises; but rather a traditional mode of context, rising action, climax, and resolution, with only the smallest question mark at the end and and only a handful of twists. The point is not to keep you uncertain of each moment, as many thrillers tend towards, but rather keep you fixed at the coming climax, i.e. ""What shall be the outcome of the grand scheme?""

The accouterments are first class. I can't imagine the casting could have been better. The acting is superb. The soundtrack is unmatched by any film in history to my knowledge.

If you allow yourself to watch this all the way through with no interruptions, you're certain to be entranced from start to finish. The narrative of Master and Commander allows me a first hand look into a world I very much enjoy visiting and revisiting.",1419897600,,2317,4.753731343283582

1863767,4,B00008W64E,"A rousing sea story of combat between the French and English in the Napoleonic Era. I must admit that I exhausted most of my attention span for the genre,as for Westerns, when every second movie made was one or the other. Nonetheless, I found this one entertaining, enlivened by some excellent battle scenes and a superior look at life in His Majesty's Navy in the last decades of dominance by the sailing ship. The acting was impeccable and the familiar scenes benefited from that fact and a good script.
As an American, of course, I was somewhat torn as to whom I should root for, after all, in the time period covered by the film, one war with the British was only 20 years behind us and a fresh war in which our Capital was burned loomed immediately before us. During that same era, we owed the French for invaluable material and political support in our most parlous days in the 18th Century and, later, for selling us ""Louisiana"",  which transferred to us ownership of Land which was to be of seminal importance to the stature of the United States. (Of no interest to anyone, I am sure, is the fact that I settled the dilemma by retaining a neutral stance during the battles.)

The opening scene is a masterpiece of film artistry. The night crew run by some very junior officers runs across the French ship in a fog bank. The battle that comes on is a fine depiction of the horror of war at that time (not that war has gotten any less horrible). The sea takes its toll as well as they chase the French ship around South America.

I enjoyed it both times as it is beautifully filmed and historically accurate for the most part (the cannons used are bigger than they would have been - things like that for dramatic effect).  I have not read the book so cannot make a comparison.  I have visited the HMS SURPRISE, the ship used in the film.  That visit really brought out more details of the film for me.

He is Lucky Jack from his battle skills, to navigating tactically to crossing the horn.  He reminds me of the Gregory Peck depiction of Hornblower.
I liked everything about this movie from the story line, the underdog British ship mismatched against a superior French foe, the crew characterizations, the drunken dinners while the ship is swaying, the surprise ending and the wonderful 18th century violin and cello music.

I strongly suggest that if you wish to know what Mr O'Brien's books are lie, read them. I think the casting was good,as was the screenplay. As a professional costumer, I always pay particular attention to costuming and props, and in tis film I can find nothing to complain about. I recommend this film without hesitation. The only thing that disappointed me was the the movie didn't actually complete the Story, it ends with an English prize crew aboard the French Frigate, and Aubrey learning that the enemy Captain, who he thought was dead, had tricked him and is actually among the prisoners aboard the captured Frigate. The movie cries out for a sequel, which has not been forthcoming. But this wonderful movie really brings the period of 'Wooden ships and iron men' to life.",1404691200,,973,4.695906432748538

The Movie:
This movie is actually surprisingly good. It's one of those box office flops that you never saw in the theaters, but that didn't deserve to be a flop. Excellent CGI for the time, excellent visuals and outstanding audio.

I bought the blu-ray instead of streaming it for one major reason - and that is the audio. This movie is known for its awesome surround sound effects and  I wanted the loss-less audio (which the streaming version does not include). Despite the amazon listing not saying it, this movie does have DTS-HD Master Audio. The surround sound is amazing, the cannon fire has deep bass, the wood splintering and flying behind you. When you are below deck you can hear people above decking walking around on your surround speakers, and waves crashing.  If you want to show off your surround sound this is a great movie to do that!

One thing that was disappointing (hence the -1 star) to me was the blu-ray quality. There were several scenes where you could see it was grainy, as if the movie was just up-converted to 1080p. I noticed that there was another Blu-Ray release in 2011 (this one was from 2008), I wonder if the 2011 release fixed these issues.",1398124800,,1237,4.63013698630137

attacked by a modern French ship and nearly done in but Captain Jack
refuses to give in.  They are out gunned, and out numbered but he's
determined no matter the cost in lives.  There is some opposition from
mostly the ships doctor, also a friend of Jack.  It's packed full of special
effects and lots of action but we found the accents very hard to understand at
least 50 percent of the time.  We were sure we missed important dialogue so
for that reason we give it 4 stars.  Perhaps closed captioning might work

Seriously this is a great action film that shows what life was like aboard an English ""man of war"" in the late 1700's and early 1800's and how brutal ship to ship combat was.  If I had any complaints it would be that it needed more ""broadsides"" combat (although it was based on the novel and such combat may have been limited in the story itself) and the deleted scenes should have been blended into the movie to make an extended version (director's cut).

For the lossless audio quality alone you shoudl pick this one up. no joke the audio is 10/10, if your system can support lossless and you have quality speakers/sub get ready b/c it flawless, this entire soundtrack from the cannons exploding to the suttle creaks on the ship floorboards was all done digitally, nothing was recorded live so as you can imagine its perfect. directionally seamless around the sound stage from front to back speakers its an audio delight. the battle scenes will have you looking all around the room and grining with each cannon fire!

Well, it tells a good human story. You see the characters through their relationships with each other. It's great action. The ships tossing about during a storm is pretty gripping as is the cannon fire blowing holes into the ship's mast and side. The history is disturbing. Seeing young boys at sea and in positions of low level power makes you feel both horrified and lots of admiration. So, it's a movie that makes you feel something. The plot is simple. The commander of the Surprise is tasked with bringing down the Acheron. That's it. The game is on!

The cast was well chosen. Everyone looks 100% authentic and sincere. It's well acted and written. I recommend it for those who like a story that doesn't have sex, lots of explosions, and violence (there is some blood and guts, but it is appropriate and not gratuitous).",1391731200,,985,4.472222222222222

Unfortunately, too often the movie adaptation of a novel and your imagination's images are so discrepant that the whole experience is spoiled.  Fortunately, that's not the case with this movie.  Although not a strict adaptation of the novel of the same name -- it pulls from several of the books in the series -- the movie stays true to O'Brian's world.  So a fan of Aubrey and Maturin can watch ""Master and Commander"" and experience the same thrill that comes from reading the books, enhanced by the incredible re-creation of the ships and their crew from the era of sails and super-powers.",1391385600,,711,4.795081967213115

One thing i remember in particular is the excellent 5-track sound track.  If you deploy your side and rear speakers, you will be immersed in the ships sonic landscape.  The background sound of lines stretching in their blocks and the creaking of timbers as pitch and roll shifts contributes to a strong illusion of ""being there.""

It has the necessary war violence of the Napoleonic naval battles and the men and boys who comprise the officers and men of a ship of the line.  The brutalities of war: shot, sword, and decisions exist amidst crisis, and  there is a wholesomeness to this, not withstanding the political issues of the day, but rather, it offers the lan and spiritedness of camaraderie that is often missing in many movies.  It is a good answer to the emasculated Hollywood with its banal pornography of violence or the opposite genre of neutered metrosexuals.  It is just a good to have a movie about honor.

Here, he plays ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, a warship on the trail of the Archeron, a French raider in Napoleon's navy heading down the South American coast. Just as James Cameron used state-of-the-art movie technology to transport his audience inside the fabled and ill-fated luxury liner Titanic, so too does Weir - and using the same studio facilities in Baja California that Cameron used - to portray life in the Royal British Navy of the period. Sparing no details, he provides the most vivid depiction yet of the sea battles of those days, and as harrowing as some of the sequences are, you may feel the same as the young seaman whom Aubrey employs to play a desperate and dangerous trick on the Archeron.

I like the Pirates of the Caribbean series but it is on a different level than Master and Commander. I thought the special effects were amazing but not overdone so much they looked stupid. I live near the Flagship Niagara and enjoyed watching this movie and then going on a real tall ship. I cannot imagine how bad life on board these ships were. I felt the movie got my attention fast and did not let go until the end credits rolled. I said it in another movie review but I'll repeat it here: I only purchase movies from Amazon that I've seen before and know I will enjoy watching it several more times.

1864013,5,B00008W64E,"This film is based on the tenth novel of author Patrick O'Brian's so-called Aubrey-Maturin series of historical novels about naval warfare during the Napoleonic war (there were a total of 20 such novels all together). I have an interest in military history and have read volumes 1 through 18 of that series of novels by O'Brian. Of all the war movies that I have seen, this one is perhaps my favorite. Not only does the screenplay do justice to O'Brian's novel, the acting, casting, cinematography, and special effects are first rate (Russell Crowe was especially well cast as Captain Jack Aubrey). In the novels, the sensitive relationship between Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is well presented. But because this film did not do well at the box office, no future film adaptations of O'Brian's novels are likely to be forthcoming, and so the relationship between O'Brian and Maturin will not be further developed in future film versions of O'Brian's story. (In addition to being a naturalist and an outstanding trauma surgeon, Maturin is also a highly effective intelligence operative [ie, a spy] -- a fact that is only briefly alluded to in this film.)  Nor will Jack's bittersweet relationship with his wife, Sophia, be developed. The fact that none of these relationships and none of these dimensions of Jack's and Stephen's characters will be developed further in future film versions of O'Brian's story is regrettable.

1864024,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is a marvelous film. It is extremely beautiful and in its slavish attention to the detail of life on an early nineteenth century British Navy vessel it is one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen.

The film tells the story of Captain Aubrey and his crew aboard the H.M.S. Surprise as they attempt to track and destroy an enemy vessel, the superior French boat the Archeron.

It is epic, but also intensely personal. For the entirety of the film we see only the events from the viewpoint of the members of the Surprise's crew. Director Peter Weir essentially enlists the audience in Britain's Navy for the two hour runtime. We are there with them for every moment, and like them, we cannot leave. The film feels almost documentary-like both for its intimate approach and for the amount of detail in day to day workings on the ship.

There isn't any character development to speak of, but none is needed. We are seeing a ""slice of life"" so we don't need to see Aubrey overcome his near-compulsive oath to duty, nor any other such character revelations.

The story is simple, but this movie is written more like a theatrical play where the spotlight is fully on the actors and their characters rather than piling melodramatic events to create an epic.

Being confined to just one boat, and with not much more story than a long game of cat and mouse, however, can leave the film feeling slow at times. There were also a few scenes where the jump between scenes was rather awkward, making me feel like I missed something between the two, exactly like when you watch a movie edited for time on television.

For an epic that doesn't try to blow it all out on spectacle and intense moments, but stays very realistic throughout and delivers very human characters, look no further than Master and Commander.",1380412800,,1827,4.640866873065016

1864033,5,B00008W64E,"It is hard to believe this film has been around for a decade, and indeed it gets better every time I watch it.

For me, it is not only that Patrick O'Brien is a great author, the director of the film, Peter Weir, has done a masterful job of presentation and the actors used in this film are all excellent, and especially Russell Crowe.

Being an amateur historian with a great interest in British history of this period, this film is a treasure.  For those viewers not familiar with the naval terms of that time, some of this will go over their heads, but a little patient research will take the viewer into a world of long ago, when wooden ships sailed the seas, and the British navy was the ruler of the same.

The beginning of the film shows the British frigate ""Surprise"" sailing at night.  The caption states, "" HMS Surprise, 28 guns  197 souls N. coast Brazil.""  With this simple summary, you realize that these are not just mere sailors, they are souls, bound together on a wooden ship of 28 guns. As in the beginning as throughout the movie, you see a realistic interpretation of what life on an English man-of-war was like at the beginning of the 19th century.

Through the character of Captain Jack Aubry, you learn the respect that he has for his crew and their well-being, and at the same time his resolute courage in carrying out the orders given to him.  Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor, plays an important role in this movie as a dedicated doctor, but lacking the stubbornness if you will of Aubry and the resulting tensions that arise from this, to be resolved at a later time in the Galapagos Islands (30 years before Charles Darwin's journey there).

Every attention is given to detail.  The viewer will understand the movie better if familiar with terms used at that time (hard a larboard... the taffrail, the weather gauge, and many more.

The biggest surprise of the movie thus far for me is that the sequel has not shown up because the ending of the story allows for another adventure to take place.  Well, Hollywood will take care of that in due time.

Of some importance is the fact that you can watch this movie as a family.  There is very little profanity, and no nudity, but there is violence.  You see men killed and it was most interesting to watch the effect of cannonballs on wood.  One of the leading causes of death was flying splinters during an engagement.  With that said, Aubry makes it clear to one of the midshipmen during combat to stand tall on the quarterdeck.  Officers could not show fear to their men, and indeed, Lord Nelson himself was felled by the bullet of a French sniper during the battle of Trafalgar while standing tall on the quarterdeck of the Victory.

I admit I am an Anglophile, a student of naval history as well as British history, so this movie was right up my alley.

1864053,4,B00008W64E,"Taken from the Aubrey-Maturin tales of author Patrick O'Brian, this film focuses on the Captain and crew of the H.M.S. Surprise, based on the captured (and renamed) french corvette of the same name.

Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the film does an excellent job of portraying naval life and strategy of the early 19th Century, including the harsh conditions and to a degree the brutal discipline that typified the Royal Navy of that period.  Crowe plays the dashing Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, loved and admired by his crew for his compassion, daring, and bravery and is counterbalanced by his close friend and ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany.  It is their friendship, and their ensuing personal conversations throughout many scenes in the film that provide most of the depth and internal struggles of these main characters as moving subplots to what is mostly a military drama.

Focusing on the cat and mouse sea chase between the much larger and heavily armed/armored French Frigate Acheron, and the smaller lighter H.M.S. Surprise, the film also sheds light on a world before Darwin, when most of the known world had yet to be explored, and when navigation was done by sextant rather than GPS.

As perhaps the only modern naval drama of the contemporary period, the film spares no opportunity to shed light on this age of tall wooden ships.  The brutality of naval warfare, and the crudeness of shipboard medical care is on full display and one cannot help but be both impressed and awed by the character and courage of the men who sailed in this period.

The transfers are of excellent quality, and the bonus features - which include a pop-up map feature to indicate where the current action is taking place, are enjoyable but not distracting.  In fact I felt that this edition has the proper balance of special features and price as to not feel bloated with worthless add-ons to make for a very good value.

Though Crowe's star has faded somewhat in recent years, this Blu Ray captures the actor at his peak even though his performance  is comparably subdued.  Crowe is alternately dark and severe, then light and raucous, and again boyishly mischievous - all the qualities one would expect to emanate naturally from a Royal Naval Captain, and some of his best moments on screen are when he says nothing at all and we see that drama playing out behind his eyes.  The scene where he makes eye contact with an indigenous woman while requisitioning is one fine example.

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, five stars being reserved for truly timeless and classic films worthy of such superlative rankings.  However, movie goers who are searching for gripping story lines with brilliants acting and cinematography will not be disappointed and will see their money well spent investing in this edition.",1372550400,,2830,4.86875

1864055,4,B00008W64E,"Whether we like it or not, we all have our own ""Master and Commander.""  If you're a philosopher, you probably believe that it is nature.  If you're religious, it's probably divinity.  And if you are in military service, it's probably the government.  If you're Stephen Maturin -- the surgeon and naturalist on board the ship, played very well by Paul Bettany -- you probably feel that your ""Master and Commander"" is the first in that list.  If you're Jack Aubrey -- the captain on board the ship, and played even better by Russell Crowe -- you probably feel obligation to the last two.

I got a real feeling for the Theory of Evolution here, especially since the crew makes a trip to the Galapagos Islands.  I'm not sure if this film is set before Charles Darwin came up with his ""On the Origin of Species,"" but no matter.  I'm sure that people way before him were thinking about some of these same things, and Mr. Maturin seems to fit that bill.  He wants to know why some birds on the island have insufficient wings for flight; why some insects look like sticks; why all of the species there have changed to fit their environment.  He's thinking about the ""natural order of things,"" or perhaps ""the survival of the fittest"" already, perhaps even before Mr. Darwin.

But Captain Aubrey is thinking about the same themes, but from a different perspective.  To him, the survival of the fittest involves humans in combat.  After all, humans are animals, and if only the strong survive amongst non-human animals, why should the same not apply with humans as well?  We evolve too, perhaps more in intelligence than anything else.  (I'm not sure modern-day man is all that intelligent, but I digress.)

Mr. Crowe reminds me of Captain Kirk here a bit from ""Star Trek,"" although Mr. Crowe's character isn't chasing women across the galaxy, but is rather chasing another ship across the ocean.  And Mr. Crowe uses his intelligence at least once to gain advantage over another, just like Captain Kirk would always seem to do.  And this happens around about the time that our two main characters seem to finally start truly understanding and respecting each other; after all, before that, each has his own priorities, and each has his own ""master and commander,"" and those ""masters and commanders"" seem to be mutually exclusive.

But with Mr. Crowe, it would be only the natural order of things for him to give a fine performance in a fine movie.  He just never seems to devolve as an actor to me.",1372204800,,2488,4.675862068965517

Along the way he has to deal with an old ship that needs repair, a diverse crew, an unlucky junior officer, and his surly friend Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor. Captain Aubry must catch his enemy before he can capture the valuable British whaling fleet.

This movie is very enjoyable. It gives a pretty good look into the life of the British navy during the Napoleonic Wars. For the plot Director Peter Weir borrowed freely from a number of the Aubrey/Maturin stories by Patrick O'Brian. The characters make the show. Russell Crowe captures the serious side of Jack Aubrey, though more time should have been given to Aubrey's more amusing side. The Jack Aubrey of the novels is a lot more fun loving than the Aubrey we see in the film. Even so Crowe gives us a character that, like his crew, we can both love and respect. Paul Bettany is wonderful as Stephen Maturin. Maturin is a learned man and a physician who has taken to adventuring as the ship's doctor. He is Jack's friend and confidant.

It is accurate down to the flying wood splinters, one of which spears the captain in the neck during an early battle.  Russell Crowe is wonderful as are the other actors.  I have watched it many times and I never get tired of seeing it again and again.",1361059200,,342,4.3125
1864102,5,B00008W64E,"First off, this is perhaps one of the best movies of 2003 if not the last decade. It's difficult to imagine why it received a luke-warm reception at the box office, but then again so many great movies often don't do as well as they should. Russel Crowe's other notable period piece, Gladiator, achieved phenomenal success with a fraction of the historical detail and depth of dialogue that this film has to offer. I can't think of another film that does this great of a job paying tribute to English naval commanders of that era.

While I'm not intimately familiar with British naval history, I get the impression from this film that the warship commanders of the day were cunning tacticians, charismatic leaders, and fearless explorers in their own right. If that is true, then I believe that their story needs to be told in a theatrical format that is both visually stunning and intellectually captivating. This film did just that. Prior to watching this, my last recollection of a memorable film set in this context was ""The Bounty"" with Anthony Hopkins and Liam Neeson. It was a terrific film, but had more of a documentary-themed storyline as opposed to action-oriented fiction.

One of the more interesting aspects is the unique chemistry that plays out between the lead characters Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe, and Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany. Capt. Aubrey is the ship's commander, an officer of the British Royal Navy. Dr. Maturin has the official duty of being the ship's surgeon, but has a broader, more informal role as a naturalist / scientist. Throughout the film, we see occasional glimpses into their personalities as they interact with one another. They have very distinct, contrasting perspectives that at times can be a source of conflict between them. Aubrey, being the ship's commander, has the final say in all matters, but his rank does not preclude his respect and consideration for his good friend and occasional advisor, Dr. Maturin.

To put it plainly, their character development is a twist on the relationship between Star Trek's Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock. As is obvious, Kirk is the Star Trek counterpart to Aubrey. The starship Enterprise's science officer, Spock, is a role similar to that of scientist/naturalist Dr. Maturin. However, the similarities end there. The persona portrayed by Bettany as Dr. Maturin contradicts the boring, unfeeling, calculating scientist stereotype -- a stereotype perpetuated by the almost satirically ""logical"" Mr. Spock. The scientific nature of Mr. Spock is in fact presented as a flaw of character that limits his ""human-ness"" to the point of his being socially inept.

What we see from Dr. Maturin is a psychological 180. Not only is he human, but he is what some would call a ""humanist."" He is opposed to disciplinary floggings, taking the side of the offending sailor in one scene. He makes allusions to his disdain for tyrannical establishments, accusing Aubrey of ""abusing power"" at one point. He is both compassionate and conscientious. Not only does he mentor the midshipman Mr. Blakely in the ways of science, but while exploring the Galapagos he has the sense of mind to release his coveted live specimens instead of leaving them needlessly imprisoned in cages. His passion for observing nature stems from his appreciation for nature itself, not just from a desire to achieve fame through new discoveries. He provides Aubrey with powerful insight into the intricacies of human nature. This happens when Aubrey expresses his befuddlement over the zealousness of the enemy captain, to which Maturin replies, ""He fights like you, Jack.""

His ability to tune out the daily militarized routine of the HMS Surprise by reinventing himself as a naturalist is an attribute that indirectly expands the breadth of their mission. But, as Aubrey put it, ""We do not have time for your damned hobbies, sir!"" It's clear that Maturin's approach to leadership is not befitting an officer in his majesty's navy -- nor is he one. In fact his interpretaton of serving king and country runs counter to that creed on a fundamental level, and that is one more reason why he is an antithesis of the Mr. Spock stereotype.",1360800000,,4200,4.994285714285715

Its storyline is a more unified whole to me now, and every time I watch it I find myself even more enthralled.

1864153,5,B00008W64E,"Final recommendation first: This is a good movie. Possibly the best of the Napoleonic period, navy movies -ever (full stop, no further qualifications)

Now for the review:

Once upon a time His Majesty's Royal Navy had the following officer ranks: Midshipman, usually a child or very young boy whose main job was to learn the seafaring craft. His battle station would normally be amidships, where he would best be able to repeat the orders of the Captain.
Lieutenant - a Midshipman who has passed his examination or by heroic action been advanced to permanent rank. A lieutenant was generally considered to be able to perform any duties normally assigned to a Naval Officer.
Captain, or Post Captain. Once you made ""Post"" you were deemed fitted to command a ship, note that in this case the term `Ship' means more than a big boat. As in a ship rigged or ship or the line.
Once you made Post, all you had to do was live long enough and you could expect to make the final rank: Admiral. As an Admiral, you could be expected to command fleets or similar major shore commands.

A Lieutenant, placed in command of a smaller ship, such as a small frigate, would be a Lieutenant (Commanding). He would have over-all charge of the ship and final responsibility as regards to her mission and general state of readiness. The ships master or Sailing Master was the person charged with the navigation and general sailing of the ship. Where the Admiralty felt that the Lieutenant (Commanding) was an accomplished sailor, he would be titled as Master and Commander.

With that as background, we have ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, Master and Commander of his favorite ship - HMS Surprise (variously a 5th rate or 6th rate frigate rating 28 guns) wherein, many years before he had first served as midshipman. Indeed, the HMS Surprise still caries his initials carved into the top of the mainmast where he had been ""masted"" as punishment.

Serving along side of Lieutenant (Master and Commander) Aubry is best friend and ships surgeon, Stephen Maturin.  The Ship's mission is to hunt down and destroy the American built, French ship the Acheron (44 guns and at least a 3rd rate ship). The French ship is larger, faster and almost magically better informed about the Surprise. None of these facts would have mattered to the British Admiralty. The Admiralty would have gladly broken Lucky Jack and left him beached, with no paying commission as they all knew that HM's frigates never lost in single ship actions.

Unfortunately the Acheron would open the movie by dealing a hugely destructive and unanswered broadside to the surprised, Surprise.  The Acheron would then sail off to the far side of the world: Around the Horn and into the Pacific. The Surprise would be left to make and, mend before, acting in excess of her orders begin the hard, life threatening trek in the wake of the Acheron. Meantime there would remain the problem of how the little Surprise would succeed her next meeting.

So much for the plot

The Aubrey Maturin books by Patrick O' Brian are among the true classics of Naval Literature. I have read them all at least twice, heard them on CD or tape at least as many times, and will likely do the same again. I fully agree with those would compare his style to Jane Austin's with the important difference that O'Brian has things happen and does not need the extra 200 pages to get to them.

Jack Aubry and Horatio Hornblower would have enjoyed each others company. O'Brian's writing  however is a far more nuanced and complex than Forester's.

Master and Command the Movie, is a mash up of several of the early Aubrey, Maturin novels. This may offend the true literary loyalist, for me it was not a problem. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Lucky Jack. This is the same performance he gives in Gladiator and Robin Hood, never mind it works here. Paul Bettany, could have been born to play Steven Maturin. He is physically, mentally and otherwise the right foil and true friend to Crowe's Aubrey.

The only real complaint I have ever had about this movie is that it so completely captures the seagoing aspects of the O'Brian Novels that there is no need for a sequel. Of late I am going to pin my hopes on the fact that this movie only scratches the surface of the many faces of Dr. Maturin, Physician, Naturalist and not portrayed here, Spy! Further, Lucky Jack is a man of many problems dealing with life ashore. Between a few love affairs too many, bad political and financial judgments there is much left in the literary series that could be made into more Aubrey/Maturin movies.

Movie makers are you listening?",1345420800,3,4621,4.701732673267327
1864154,5,B00008W64E,"As a former naval officer I remember sitting through a showing of the movie ""Twelve O'Clock High"" in our leadership classes.  The movie was used to demonstrate contrasting leadership styles. ""Master and Commander,"" if it had been available all those decades ago, would have been an excellent movie to demonstrate the the calm, calculating thought, often accentuated with a smile, that is required in a leader when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  Russel Crowe's Jack Aubrey demonstrates that trait beautifully.

Leadership aside though, the movie's attention to seafaring detail is phenomenal.  Although I was part of the modern Navy, the DTS soundtrack of the movie captures the constant intrusions of sounds at sea; all the squeaks, clanks, snores, footsteps, splashes, wisps and howls of the wind are an ever present character in the film.  Of particular note was the use of the ""chipset,"" a simple device that used knotted line to accurately give the ship's speed in ""knots.""  Also, though easy to miss, there is a scene while the ship is attempting to ""round the Horn"" at the tip of South America, where it shows a sailor using the ""head,"" the nautical term for the toilet on the ship.  If you look carefully as the camera pans from the front to the back of the ship, you'll see a sailor with his pants around his ankles sitting on a holed plank off the front or ""head"" of the ship.  For obvious reasons the head was placed as far as possible from the captain's quarters, the area at the far aft (back) of the ship.

Finally, the acting in the movie is exceptional, the battle scenes chaotic, and the cannonball shots impressive. You almost want to duck as the cannonshots approach and tear through the ship.  Whether you buy the DTS encoded DVD or Blu-ray, the battle scenes will impressively exercise your home theater system.",1344902400,3,1848,4.856687898089172

1864169,5,B00008W64E,"When movie magic is at its best, the viewer is immersed in the story, and believes everything portrayed on the screen.  Case in point:  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, Peter Weir's epic depiction of life at sea in the early 19th Century.  Here we find gritty authenticity where absolutely nothing is spared, from the suffocating stench of below decks, to the mirth and mayhem of the ship's officers dining together, to the brutality of hand-to-hand combat as one ship overtakes another.  It's all as believable as it is spellbinding, as we follow HMS 'Surprise' as it plays a cat-and-mouse game across two oceans with a vastly superior French frigate.

Russell Crowe is the headliner playing Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, a most approachable commander with a winning disposition paired with astonishing resolution; Captain Aubrey is going to take the French ship, dire consequences or no.  This often puts him at odds with the ship's surgeon and Jack's personal friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany); Maturin serves as a sort of barometer for the crew, and is allowed to be upfront and frank with the captain.  These exchanges create remarkable tension, as both men have unwavering mutual respect.  Meanwhile we're privy to the ongoing adventures of the 'Surprise' as it sails the Atlantic, rounds the Cape of South America, and heads into the immense waters of the Pacific; from battle to meatball surgery to topsails to camaraderie to rigid discipline to the sailors' infatuation with superstition.  The cast playing the crew is stellar, including Billy Boyd (who will always be known to me as Pippin).  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is an engrossing and enchanting tale, enthusiastically recommended for all movie buffs.

Let me state that I am a long time movie fan, have a large select library of movies and books, and feel the movie industry is letting us down generally. NOT HERE. Master and Commander is, I feel, Peter Weir's best effort and holds its own against Gregory Peck's Moby Dick as a historically accurate portrayal of the rigors of 1805 Naval life and battles. No detail is overlooked in superstition, man overboard, loss of life and limb,discipline by flogging, and the range of education/lack thereof within the crew. The acting is wonderful and the second disc fascinating showing how they did it all making the film. You feel the ship move, smell the smoke in battle, and feel the sea air as they climb the rigging. WOW.
  I was happily surprised by the use of classical music and the wonderful score done by Iva Davies,Christopher Gordon, and Richard Tognetti, Australian composers. This score is a true character in this movie used during the montages of daily shipboard duties, evading attack into the fogbank,beating to quarters,battles, and burial procedures. Wonderful treatment and SO important!
The relationship between the two main male characters, the captain(Russell Crowe)and the ship's Doctor (Paul Bettany) is elevated by the fact they play stringed instuments well together and share that as a much needed outlet in the hardships,boredom, and terror of their life at sea. The final scene of Captain and Doctor playing a memorable piece as the ship turns about..WONDERFUL!

1864173,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander

Russell Crowe is Captain Jack Aubrey, who's been commissioned to capture or kill The Acheron, a French frigate that may take Napoleon's war to the Pacific.  The thing is, Capt. Jack is obsessed.

We have various relationships occurring on board; we get to know the men as they fight against weather and against becalmed conditions and as well shrapnel from well-placed cannon fire from the Acheron.

What makes the movie great is how the captain has to decide between his duty,  his ship and the men aboard, even if it means some have to die in order for the ship to be saved.  He does not take these lightly and it adds to the drama and suspense.  A man is caught on a mast as it crashes into the ocean.  Because of the storm conditions, the ship is anchored.  He has to cut the mast free but that will mean the death of the survivor in the water.  Tough decision.

This movie is fairly realistic - an arm cut off from a 12 year old boy is especially hard to watch.  The doctor is a scientist as well and has a good relationship with the captain, though this is strained when the captain decides to break his promise to the doctor to explore the Galapagos Islands in favor of the chase for the frigate.

If it were not for the year 1805 or the trappings of the time, I could easily see this story as a Star Trek episode, chasing the enemy despite everything for God and country.

Favorite scenes include the realistic battles between frigate and the HMS Surprise, a chat about Lord Nelson and his demand for salt, and the clever French in how they disguise their captain which I thought was simply hilarious.  There's a lot of medical procedures too that are at times hard to watch!

Bottom Line:  Russell Crowe makes a stern, calm yet determined sea captain - this is a must-see film.  It's visceral, the mood of the period is flawlessly captured, and you find yourself rooting for the British!  This film is based on the books by Patrick O'Brien.  Recommended.

1864178,4,B00008W64E,"I will grant that the video quality on blu-ray could be better, and should be better. However, what continues to bother me about this and other book-to-film translations is how O'Brian fans are nerd raging about how Weir doesn't capture this or that, or how characters are poorly cast. Here's what anyone viewing the movie should know:

1. Face it, folks: books cannot be completely captured in their complexity or splendor in a 2 hour film, and that's about all the time you get to hook the audience, and then proceed to tell a story from its very start to completion. Wrap your mind around that, and you will not make the mistake of judging a movie by its book ever again!

2. Books are a different medium. They rely on imagination entirely. You can't reasonably expect for any visualization of one person's interpretation to match up or even come close to your fantasy of how the book should look in visual form. That's just a fair assessment, folks. Lighten up. That goes for who should've been cast in your opinion, as well as what the scenery should've looked like.

3. Finally, the movie as a stand alone work is excellent. Forget what the books are about, or who the characters are in the books. I haven't read them, and have been inspired to pick up the collection because of this. It's a joy to take in, and it will make you want more, which I think is a mark of success for a book-to-film translation. It is not a bunch of action sequences with gore or explosions like you would get out of a summer blockbuster like Pirates of the Caribbean. It's thoughtfully and tastefully done, and thoroughly enjoyable for those reasons.

Bottom line is this is one to own. I'm not sure if the blu-ray special edition is worth the extra money, but you should own this movie. That alone is enough to know.",1316736000,2,1802,4.5184049079754605

1864184,5,B00008W64E,"Although other reviewers have pointed out that the film is based on Patrick O'Brian's ""canon"" of 20 books which constitute, in their entirety, a 7,000 page novel, complaints that 'Master and Commander' doesn't tell the story of any one of the books are misplaced, in my opinion. In fact, the film cherry-picks the highlights of certain themes that run through most of the 20 novels, and does it very well. The personality conflicts that give life and substance to the friendship of the two principal characters -Captain Jack Aubrey and physician/naturalist Stephen Maturin, are revealed, but not overdone. The depiction of the early 19th century British Navy as a square-fisted, hard-drinking band of brothers brought together by shared hardship and mortal danger is vividly displayed in a way not often found in cinematic nautical adventure stories.

Perhaps this is a narrow viewpoint, but in my opinion the visual effects of HMS Surprise seal this film as one of the greats in its genre. This is not a model in a millpond, but a genuine working square-rigged ship: the Rose, renamed Surprise for the film. The scenic shots of the ship under way are breathtaking. So often in sailing films we see sails flapping in the breeze so as to make it seem ""real"" in Hollywood's misguided opinion. In 'Master and Commander' every sail is drawing, luffs quivering, lines taut... in other words, it seems real because it is real. The depiction of the almost unimaginably crowded and Spartan conditions, taken as quite normal by the men of those times, are wonderfully brought to life.

The music is delightful, based as it is on a significant element of the story. Aubrey and Maturin are in fact fairly accomplished musicians on the violin and cello respectively, and that shared delight is a strong part of the glue that holds them together. Use of period music (Bach, Corelli) for violin and cello as background for well chosen scenes is inspired. The ship and the music flow together, giving both a visual and aural sense of the times.

Crowe was an excellent choice for the Aubrey character. He seems to understand that while Aubrey isn't given to excessive displays of emotion (except laughing while drunk at table, or in the midst of battle), he is not immune to them. Crowe resists the temptation to overplay Aubrey's subdued emotional reactions in order to ""give them life"", and instead gives us the man imagined by the novelist: naturally inclined to a jovial nature, extroverted, often kind, but quite steely when it came to his ship and his duty. Crowe captures the man splendidly.

The Maturin character is sometimes cited as miscast, but in my view the only miscasting lies in his appearance; the Maturin of the novels is frequently described as ""ill-looking"". Given the Hollywood obsession with good looks, it must be hard to cast for ""ugly"" and still get excellent acting skills, the field being so limited. And having Maturin reasonably good looking doesn't really detract from the story, except for the purist. He is otherwise true to character in the film.

It would be easy for a devoted follower (of which I am one) of Patrick O'Brian's canon to concentrate on the mixed plot inconsistencies and thus mutter through the movie. But that would be at the cost of missing out on a truly outstanding look at a colorful and exciting time, and the kinds of men who made those times history.

'Master and Commander -the Far Side of the World' will be an excellent addition to your library. I bought and received it only a month ago, but have already watched it three times. It's not that one expects anything ""new"" with the re-viewing. Rather, it's like Yo Yo Ma playing Bach's 'Prelude' (which is in the film)... it never gets old and is always a delight.",1310947200,3,3759,4.829192546583851
1864185,4,B00008W64E,"The year was 1805 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars.  France and England were in a seemingly relentless life and death struggle for control of the seas.  In those days the oceans were where the major battles were fought.  Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has drawn an especially difficult assignment.  As Commander of the British man-of-war ""Surprise"" he has been ordered to pursue the bigger, faster and highly elusive French privateer ""Acheron"" and ""burn, sink or take her a prize.""  Furthermore, unbeknownst to his crew Aubrey has been ordered to chase the ""Acheron"" all the way to Brazil and beyond if necessary.  ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World"" is director Peter Weir's unforgettable account of this high stakes game of cat and mouse.  This is not the kind of film that I ordinarily enjoy very much but much to my surprise it worked for me on a great many levels.

As the film opens we find the ""Surprise"" under attack by the ""Acheron"".  In the course of this battle royale the ""Surprise"" is severely damaged and its rudder disabled.  Although I am not usually a big fan of special effects I thought that they were used quite effectively in this film.  I definitely got the sense of what it must be like to be a participant in such a battle  It was painfully realistic I thought.  Meanwhile, in retaliation ""Surprise"" manages to score several direct hits on the French boat.  Unfortunately the cannon balls were unable to penetrate the hull of this newly designed ship.  If it were not for the fact that the ""Surprise"" was able to manuever itself into a foggy patch this ongoing battle would have been over right then and there.  Much to the chagrin of his crew Captain Aubrey vows to track down and capture or destroy his nemesis ""no matter the cost"".  Many of the men complain that this is a suicide mission and want no part of it.  We follow the crew of the ""Surprise"" as it pursues the ""Acheron"" down the east coast of South America.  One of the things that is most striking about this crew is that many of the sailors appear to be just teenagers.  In fact there are a few young boys on the ship who seem to be only 12 or 13 years old!  I simply cannot imagine being placed in these kind of circumstances at such a tender age.

Along the way we meet other members of the crew.  Paul Bettany does a workmanlike job in his portrayal of Dr. Stephen Maturin the ship surgeon.  Maturin is a close personal friend of Captain Aubrey and is not afraid to tell the boss when he is convinced that he is making the wrong decision.  We also catch a glimpse of how the officers and crew spend their down time.  We discover that Captain Aubrey enjoys playing of all things the violin!  My wife especially enjoyed the work of James D'Arcy as First Lt. Thomas Pullings and Edward Woodall as Second Lt. William Mowett.  She is a big fan of Charles Dickens and noted that these colorful charactors could have been created by Dickens himself!  One of the most poignant scenes in ""Master and Commander"" is when Captain Aubrey has to make a split-second decision to cut loose a young sailor who went overboard while trying to repair a sail.  It seems that the mast snapped and fell over dumping the young man into the sea with it.  Tragically, the weight of the mast threatened to capsize the entire boat and so the decision was made to cut the mast loose to save the crew.  It was a heartbreaking moment to say the least.  Oh, the burdons of command!

The pursuit of the ""Acheron"" continued right around Cape Horn at the bottom of South America and right on into the Pacific.  Before the final climactic battle the ''Surprise"" stops at the Galapagos Islands.  While there we catch a glimpse of some of the exotic birds and mammals that are indigenous to this island.  For just a brief moment you get the feeling that you are watching some kind of sci-fi flick. Dr. Maturin has been waiting all his life to see specimens like this but duty calls and the Captain orders the ship onward and outward in pursuit of its real prize.  Before long the pivotal final battle will take place.

I was quite surprised to learn that ""Master and Commander""  The Far Side of the World"" is one of the most expensive movies ever made. This film was nominated for an impressive total of 10 Academy Awards including ""Best Picture"" and came away with two awards.  I thought that the photography throughout this film was magnificent.  Meanwhile, I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredible music score much of which was written and perfomed by the noted Australian violinist Richard Tognetti (no relation).  In fact,  Mr. Tognetti acually coached Russell Crowe on how to play the violin in preparation for this film.  One final word.  ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World"" is a great family movie.  Just be prepared for a couple of scenes that feature some very necessary but gruesome medical procedures performed by Dr. Maturin.  The good doctor even assists in surgery on himself!  As the President might say this could be used as one of those ""teachable moments"" to explain to your kids about the horrors of war.  ""Master and Commander""  turns out to be a film that greatly exceeded my expectations. This is not usually the kind of film I go for.  Highly recommended!",1310342400,,5302,4.560381355932203
1864186,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a period piece with modern execution. From the standpoint of the story and cast, Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey is the ultimate star of Master and Commander. He conveys an authenticity and charisma that few actors currently possess, which allows him to pull off the Aubrey role so authoritatively.  Richard King was brought on board by director Peter Weir as ""sound designer"". His passion and technical expertise in audio engineering make the film a powerhouse cinematic experience, transporting viewers from their seats to a place onboard the British Navy ship, Surprise, off the coast of South America almost 200 years ago. More than any other aspect of the film, the realism and immersive quality of the audio puts the audience in the middle of the action. King won the Academy Award of Merit for Best Sound Editing for his work on Master and Commander. It was very well deserved, and the DTS-HD MA encode on the BD fully pays off King's fantastic sonic achievement.

The audio is the real spark that ignites Master and Commander, bringing life to the action. This was apparent even in the DVD version, but the Blu-ray goes beyond the excellent sound quality of the earlier release. Listen to the battle scene at the beginning of the film when cannons fire, the projectiles rip through the air and slam into the hull of the Surprise, splintering the wood, sending men and debris flying. Modern audio design involves a blend of sounds created in innovative ways. For example, the sound of a fist hitting someone's face is often created by recording a head of lettuce thrown onto a hard surface. Another excellent scene for evaluating the audio is as the Surprise chases the Acheron around Cape Horn. Here, the audio conveys the howling winds, torrential rain, creaking planks of the ship and the crashing waves. Rarely if ever have Blu-ray fans been treated to an audio mix with this combination of resolution and immersion. Even during quieter scenes, the audio quality is uncanny in its realism. Sonic cues like the sounds of water and footsteps lend good presence to the DTS HD MA track. The rich midrange during the Bach viola and cello pieces, as well as voices and gunshots have a strength and palpability rarely heard in home theater mixes.

Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World was one of the most commercially underappreciated movies of 2003, hands down. Thankfully, Fox didn't deliver a half-hearted DVD release...in fact, the overall quality of this 2-disc set really took me by surprise. Sporting a fantastic technical presentation, the high production values of Master and Commander really shine through, making this as close to reference quality as I've seen yet.

It does a fantastic job of capturing the feel of a nineteenth-century naval ship (the dangers of the sea, the rigid social structure of Victorian English culture, sailors' superstition) and well develops the characters within this setting. The film explores several themes (such as duty, friendship, and courage) in compelling and thoughtful ways, avoiding cliche in favor of more complex undertakings.

1864199,5,B00008W64E,"`Master and Commander', for me at least, is one of those films that surprises you by how good it turns out to be. I wasn't expecting to be gripped and captivated as much as I was. This is set during the Napoleonic wars and follows an English ship as it is chased and as it chases a French warship of superior size and strength. This basic premise may seem rather staid, but this has so much tension, as the cat and mouse game is played out, that the just over two hour duration goes by in the blink of an eye.

This conjures up the tensions, fears and excitements of life on the high seas and offers a fascinating look at life onboard one of these ships, from the captains table to the men on deck. You will enjoy the rough camaraderie and carousing amongst the crew, as well as the superstitions and cabin fever long stretches at sea engenders.

This film is shot very well and you are quickly pitched into the cramped and close quarters of life onboard. You see how the men live and fight and the hierarchy onboard as well. All the accents are `most frightfully British' and whilst it seemed mildly annoying at the start, it very quickly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Crow acts surprisingly well in this film and you can feel his charisma and drive as a captain throughout.

1864203,5,B00008W64E,"Bottom Line: In the final analysis, as the credit rolled I felt cheated; I wanted more or this suburb movie about naval action in the 19th century.

Master and Commander opens with the following caption: April 1805 Napoleon is master of Europe. Only the British Fleet stands before him. Oceans are now battlefields.

Directed by Peter Weir with screenplay by Weir and John Collee, Master and Commander is based on two novels by Patrick O'Brian, part of a twenty-book series of Royal Navy Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey's adventures spanning the later 18th - early 19th centuries.

This particular installment followed Captain Aubrey, superbly portrayed by Russell Crowe as he captains the 24 gun 6th Rate frigate HMS Surprise.  Aubrey's orders are to intercept French 4th Rate 44-gun Frigate Acheron currently en-route to the Pacific Ocean with the intention of making war in those waters off the coast of Brazil.  Aubrey is to either sink, burn, or take the French warship as a prize.

In the first five minutes of the movie however the larger, faster, more heavily armed Acheron draws first blood, when materializing out of a fog bank she delivers a devastating broadside to the HMS Surprise, damaging the ships bowstrip, mainmast, and rudder, severely crippling the ship.  If it weren't for the same prevailing fog, the quick thinking of Aubrey and able rowers, the HMS Surprise would have surely been lost and well, the movie ended.

Against all opposition Aubrey decides not to sail home for a refit of his shattered vessel, but to effect repairs at sea in a quite little inlet off the Brazilian coast.  Repairs completed the game of cat-and-mouse is taken up again as the HMS Surprise chases the Acheron around Cape Horn into the Great South Sea (Pacific), where she looses her mizzen topmast and a well liked seaman.

The chase final ends at the Galapagos Islands (of all places) where British whalers are currently plying their trade, creating the perfect backdrop for the Acheron  to do her worst, and for the climatic battle scene to take place.

My Thoughts

As it unwinds, mostly onboard the HMS Surprise, the plot evolves into an extended game of cat-and-mouse: encounters with the aptly named Acheron as the ""phantom ship"" are in juxtaposition with prolonged glimpses into life onboard a 19th century Royal Navy Frigate.  We are treated to little interaction with the French crew, save through spyglass.  Most of the human interplay is reserved for Aubrey and his mixed crew of seasoned naval veterans, conscripts involuntarily impressed into service, young midshipmen, and powderboy's who are far too young to see battle.

Weir's concentration on the HMS Surprise and her crew brings home a realism seldom seen in Hollywood productions; indeed the battle scenes between the HMS Surprise and the Acheron  seem cursory to the telling of the lives of men too harshly lived.  And Weir's passion for detail is evident in every frame as he brings to life O'Brian's rich historical details -- the sailors' routine, the pettiness and superstitions, the grim realities of 19th-century navies, the realistic battle scenes, the blood, and horror, and heroism, the honor and devotion to duty and country, are all portrayed in a stark often macabre reality.

The cast is rich, varied, and too numerous to list in narrative, but the relationship between Aubrey and his old friend, and ships doctor, Stephen Maturin, portrayed by Paul Bettany is well worth exploring and receives the most attention throughout the movie.  Maturim is Aubrey's alter ego, his rational voice, and his musical partner.  It is through their music that we are treated to the two men's attempt to bring civility to an otherwise uncivilized pursuit.

But Maturin is Aubrey's intellectual equal (Aubrey's military mind and almost mindless devotion to duty is offset by Maturin's humanity, conscience and scientific curiosity).  They are both endowed with a similar sense of honor, and know each other well enough--although we are not told from where their relationship sprang--to playfully, and oft-times earnestly challenge their respective positions, though Aubrey has to obvious upper hand; as captain the final word is his.  Their friendship was made warm and believable by their obvious onscreen chemistry; the closeness they shared while locked in a battle of wills made me wish for the same kind of uncompromising male friendship in my life.  Watching their verbal spars in the officer's mess and their infrequent musical duets together (Aubrey play the violin and Maturin plays the Cello) was for me clearly one of Master and Commander's greatest pleasures.

Though through necessity there is ""nautical"" speech peppered throughout Master and Commander, it is only used to lend realism to the story, and contemporary speech is used otherwise. The use of contemporary chatter is designed to keep the less nautical engaged in the movie drawing them deeper into the action, allowing them to care, and enveloping the story in a cloak of humanity as the HMS Surprise pursues the Acheron  across two oceans.

In the final analysis, as the credit rolled I felt cheated; I wanted more; the movie ended just as the Aubrey and Maturin were once again engaged in play, and the ship was clearing the decks for action, once more in pursuit of the Acheron after Aubrey learns a prickly bit of information. This is testimony to the movies draw, it has everything one would expect from a high-seas adventure movie set in the 19th century--exhilarating battles, menacing weather conditions, honor, bravery, devotion to duty, treachery, superstition, God, and a wonderfully cast of characters that brings life onboard the HMS Surprise to a point where you can virtually taste and smell the salt laden sea spray on your lips and feel the fresh sea air on your skin.",1290211200,3,5824,5.057471264367816

1864206,5,B00008W64E,"There are not many movies that actually enhance the reading of a good book, much less books, but Master and Commander does exactly that.

Patrick O'Brian's Aubery-Maturin series is the kind of literature that sucks you in and won't let go.  While telling the story of a charismatic British Naval sea captain and his ships surgeon, O'Brian recreated the whole world of the 19th century British seaman.  But as wonderful as those books are with thier nautical language and exciting stories, you can't imagine what you don't know.

In this wonderful movie Peter Weir brings the world of Aubery-Maturin to life.  You see it all--the farm animals, the men covering the ropes, the Marines in their red coats actually seated on deck.  You see the ocean and the fragility of the ship HMS Surprise.  You see the midshipmen, children by our standards, with men's responsibilities, risking their lives.

This is a movie to watch, and watch again.  I loved every minute of it, and see something new every time I see it.  Its a long movie and yet, I can't help wishing it were longer.  I don't know if Weir ever considered making a sequel.  I know I would love to see one.",1285027200,,1159,4.655172413793103

1864209,5,B00008W64E,"This movie really reflects navel life at sea. The way it was filmed and acted was so real life and believable. The words that were filled with sea tanged royal marine life, felt as if you were beside the men manning the deck, paving the way for a battle upon the high waves of the ocean, near some mysterious tropical island or remote tossing about like a toy on a world of water. The movie fills the screen with two excellent actors, one is Russell Crowe and the other his name forgotten, yet his skill in the performing arts shines. The movie reflects the camaraderie of the men and their well founded esteem for the capitan and the doctor. There are men of all ages, the youngest being pre-teen. They all are excited to be serving the crown, fighting against the French fleet. The movie is about the cat and mouse pursuit between the Surprise manned by the Brits and the Avature bespoken by the French. Russells ship or Captain Jack's ship is not as well made as the stronger faster rival. The movie shows the chase and their strategies in finally meeting and fighting for the prize. The images in the film are so beautiful with color and the desire to be in that moment. A sumpetious feast of symbolic brilliance. The crashing waves filled with dark mystery. The bounty floating below the wooden rails, ships brimming with perfumed fruit and lovely native men and women selling their wares. I loved the scene where the men share their dinner, young and old with anectadotes of their travels and meetings with important others. The crystal and the silver, the meals prepared by the grouchy cook. The nautical equipment was visually attractive to look at and creating imaginings of yourself in that experience. The music and the friendship displayed by Stephen the doctor and the captain. Their respect for one another, tested by the lessons of life. I especially liked the expeditions journied by the doctor learning about faraway lands and animals that had not been logged in books. His drawings and his discoveries plus his knowledge at doctoring patients, crusty with salt and young with beads of sweat. The sweltering heat when the sails sat still as did the ship upon the smoothed over wrinkles of the deep blue. The grand adventures that came from their voyages, like the Gallpagos Islands fed my yearnings for faraway places. Bon voyage.",1282867200,,2347,4.74083129584352

The acting by Russell Crowe and several other characters was great and I would imagine would be realistic for a ship crew during that time period.  At a little over 2 hours, the film seemed to breeze along smoothly and was enjoyable the whole time.

The basic plot is an English ship trying to capture or sink a French ship during the time of Napoleon.  Without giving away the ending, I will tell you that the action was riveting and the film kept my interest.

Watch and enjoy this ""guy's flick"" - okay, some women will enjoy it too!

This is one of my all-time favorite films, based on some of the best books I have ever read.  Unfortunately, the bluray is very grainy and not particularly sharp.  Frankly, it doesn't look much better than the DVD, which I purchased when it came out a few years ago.  Pity, because you couldn't ask for a film that better captures the essence of the Aubrey-Maturin books.  I see there are more than 600 reviews of this film, the overwhelmingly majority of which are very positive, so I don't think I can add anything new.",1272758400,8,617,4.572727272727272
1864216,3,B00008W64E,"MASTER AND COMMANDER (2003) works best in its depiction of the relationship between a beloved ship's captain (Russell Crowe) and his crew. A dinner scene is particularly engaging, as are the cultured moments of violin and cello duets. Manueverings off the coast of South America between frigate HMS Surprise and the more formidible French vessel the Acheron are also most interesting.

This film is a letdown however in the all-important boarding and hand-to-hand battle sequence. Shot with the shakiest of handheld cameras, it's absolutely impossible to follow what's going on, practically until the skirmish's outcome is decided. If the intention here was to baffle the viewer, this film's creators succeeded in my case. Yet, being served home movie quality smeary action after eagerly anticipating a thrilling swashbuckler of cutlass, dirk and bludgeon is just very unsatisfying to this sea adventure fan.

1864218,5,B00008W64E,"My husband and I were both enthralled by Master and Commander from beginning to end. I had forgotten all about it and did not remember whether it had good reviews upon release, but I picked it up at the video store to rent on a whim. We both enjoy English history, sailing and Russell Crowe so I thought it would be worth $4 to give it a look. What a perfect movie night we had.

The film is visually breathtaking. The attention to every detail of costume and set design is remarkable. You really do feel as though you were on an early 19th century war ship, creaky, leaky and rum-soaked in the bowels but erudite and elegant in the captain's quarters. Unlike many special effects extravaganzas and costume dramas, this is not a poor-to-mediocre film in a fancy package. The script is witty, the character development is effective, the pacing brisk, and the acting from Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany and the supporting cast reliably excellent. It is fascinating to watch how the ship works. It's really a microcosm of British society at the beginning of its great 19th century imperial expansion (albeit without women), with its class distinctions and power structures. Crowe's character, the ship's captain, represents pragmatic, confident leadership and the conviction that Britain knows what should be done and shall make sure it gets done. Paul Bettany's character, the ship's physician, represents the intellectual curiosity that led to the industrial revolution and the theory of evolution. The battle scenes are engrossing, and with a few exceptions, I don't really care for war movies.

Although it's rated PG-13 and some scenes are probably too intense for young children (especially the scene where a child sailor has his arm amputated without benefit of anesthesia), I really did not see anything objectionable for any age group.

The movie is an excellent adventure on the high seas but could have been epic. The movie picks up in the middle of the ocean with a preface of the ship's orders. From there they're suddenly attacked by a superior enemy. When the ship and crew are badly injured, Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he pursues a dangerous chase across oceans, to capture his enemy.  The movie's acting and historical accuracy are it's strongest points. Crowe and Bettany are a joy to watch play off each other. The action and cinematography are amazing as well. It could easily get 5 stars but it just feels like there was more story to tell. This movie belongs in any collector's library.

NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and fantastic audio make this a blu-ray winner. The movie is shot mostly in dark and fog so it is tough to say this is a DEMO DISC, but those who know will see how beautiful it is.

1864233,2,B00008W64E,"I've really tried to like this movie.  In watching it on blu-ray after watching it on DVD, I can truly say that the blu-ray quality is really quite good, with a few poor shots from the original film intact, and the sound is great.  I have several major problems with the movie, all of which I think seriously detract from its quality.  First, the story line really drags on, and the relationship between the French and British combatants is not really developed to the extent that it deserves, as the movie focuses more on the personal relationship of the commander (R. Crowe) and the ship's doctor/naturalist.  There are a lot of minor side plots going on, like suicidal depression, and an inordinate number of surgeries.  The time scale of the pursuit around Cape Horn, like most events in this film, is lost on the viewer.  After a while, the consistently upbeat attitude of the commander is almost maniacal!  Then there is the ununatural but substantial natural history- an unusually large part of this film, as the ship's doctor is portrayed in a Darwinesque fashion, in the Galapagos.  The first strange episode involves the identification of meal worm (Tenebrionidae) larvae as ""weevils,"" part of a pun by the commander, but clearly demonstrating the ineptness of his naturalist friend.  This gets worse on the Galapagos, particularly where impossible telescopic views of remote animals are depicted, and the naturalist releases a captured lot of common green iguanas (Iguana iguana), a species that does not occur in the Galapagos Islands.  At least in Gladiator Ridley Scott (whose work I greatly respect) used a European Robin.  Imagine your reaction if he used an American Robin in a Roman battle scene!  Terrence Mallick, in The Thin Red Line, and in The New World, has also focused on natural history, but takes care to accurately depict the local flora and fauna (more than anyone).  Given the emphasis on Natural History in this film, and its obvious cost, care should definitely have been taken in this area.  It's either sloppy movie-making, or distain for natural history.",1260576000,,2090,4.968390804597701

1864235,5,B00008W64E,"One of those movies that has grown (a significant amount I should say) on me over time, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is probably, in my personal opinion, the greatest swashbuckling sea adventure film ever filmed.  Now, when I walked out of the theater the first time I saw this I didn't feel that way.

I was supper hyped about seeing this (you think I worship Peter Sarsgaard, you should see the shrine I have in my bedroom dedicated to thy Holy Crowe) and so I was there opening night with all this built up enthusiasm and wound up nearly falling asleep and completely giving into my friends constant griping and concluded that this was a dud of a film.  Problem was, I already promised my father that I would see it with him the next day and so I braced myself for boredom (although I do enjoying watching Crowe do anything).  Get this; there in the middle of the day I watched this film through new eyes.

I absolutely loved it.

Now I was already going to buy the film regardless of my feelings (like I said, WORSHIP) but now I had a new outlook and was highly anticipating the DVD release.  While the film is glorious (I've seen it nearly twenty times and am strongly considering watching it this evening...the wife is away for the weekend which always turns into an excuse for me to eat pizza, drink beer and watch every Russell Crowe movie I own...which is all of them) I have to give a major shout-out to the extras here, because this DVD is packed with them and they are all amazing.  This should be noteworthy coming from me, because if you follow my reviews then you know that I never discuss extras because to me the review is all about the content of the film, not the DVD, but these are just too good to ignore.  I don't generally watch the extras but I've seen these a few times and find them thoroughly engaging.

Back to the film.

I think my issue with the film upon first viewing was that I was expecting something totally different.  I was under the impression that the last fifteen minutes here (briskly paced, non-stop action) was the entire film.  It is not.  It is the last fifteen minutes.  Now, as we all know, I love slow brooding character studies; but not at midnight (yes, I went to the midnight showing).  That was a huge mistake, although had it been a high speed adrenaline rush I don't think it would have been.

So, like I said, the biggest issue was that I was expecting something else entirely.

Upon subsequent viewings (many, as you can tell), I've come to appreciate this film as so much more than just your average high seas tale.  There is a beautiful honesty about its portrayal of sea life that makes me quiver in appreciation, but there is also a genuine sense of comradeship that really becomes the basis for the film in my opinion.  The chemistry between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is utterly fantastic and it really makes this a simmering beauty of a film.  There is a natural elegance with the way Crowe portrays Jack Aubrey's feelings towards his crew, and the awkwardness with which he tells a joke (much like a grandfather at a dinner party, unsure of others reactions but sure in his own `need' to tell it) is completely endearing.  Just witness the way he allows his character to seep into his delivery, making every word seem so natural and almost expected (""Name a shrub after me; something prickly and hard to eradicate."")  Matching him every step of the way is Bettany who completely soaks his character Stephen in a rich loyalty and constant admiration.  Even when Jack displeases Stephen you can tell he is only displeased because he knows in his heart that Jack can do better.  He believes in him that strongly.  Both performances are utterly stunning and completely deserving of any and all praise.

The fact that both were snubbed of Oscar nominations is disgusting, especially when those hammy `Mystic River' men took home the gold.

Peter Weir is in top form here, creating such an authentic look at naval life.  I love the way that the creaks from the wood on the boat can be heard in every frame.  There is not a single false note here.  It's remarkable to tell you the truth; totally and completely remarkable.

So, knowing what you are in for will surely heighten your appreciation for this modern masterpiece.  It is the best of a genre and more than that, the best in the world that is cinema.  It fleshes out not just the two men who form the focus of the film, but it fleshes out the world that is sea life; the ship itself becoming a major player in this film.",1257465600,3,4560,4.480629539951574
1864236,4,B00008W64E,I found this film to be extremely well-done. Naval combat during the Napoleonic Wars was an extremely unpleasant and bloody business and this movie addresses this aspect. There was a lot of drama form the interaction of the crew and the circumstances in which they are placed. And the acting is excellent.

1864237,5,B00008W64E,"Excellent Napoleonic seafaring tale recounting the lone pursuit by HMS Surprise of the French warship Acheron set in 1805 in the South Atlantic and Pacific. The acting performances are top level throughout whether we're talking about Russell Crowe's Captain Aubrey of the Surprise or any of the other shipboard mates and midshipmen. The movie provides close-up and brutal battle action featuring 18-inch guns and on-board swashbuckling scuffles that take the fight right into your 5.1 surround home theater room.

Highlights of this atmospheric film include the opening battle with the Acheron, sailing through a dangerous storm at Cape Horn with enormous waves thrusting at the ship, an all too brief visit by the ship's naturalist to the Galapagos to check out the animal life, musical duet by Crowe and ship's surgeon Paul Bettany, and the final encounter and victory over the Acheron.

In between we get a realistic look at daily shipboard life and the usual protocol and conflicts between midshipmen and the crew and the captain. While impatient viewers may lust for more intense action here, these scenes do everything to make the story all the more realistic. This is the kind of film that becomes even more appreciated on repeated viewings.

The Blu-ray production is mostly first-rate including ship detail, uniforms, facial features, and even the texture of paper on written letters and seacharts. It did seem like some initial terrain scenes in the Galapogos were far less than 1080 lines.

Special Features. Fox previews are here where they belong. The Map feature allows you to press Enter anytime to display a map in the lower corner which indicates the current position of the HMS Surprise.

Deleted scenes - Many of these should have been left in the release: A guy getting his tooth pulled the old-fashioned way is quite humorous as is that of the lad getting tattoed with the basic ink and needle method. Scenes of the Surprise cruising in the open ocean and especially those on the Galapagos where the scene with the tortoses is expanded and the blue-footed booby is examined. These scenes may have added another 15 minutes but would have been worthwhile (future Director's release of course). The deleted scenes are only DVD quality.",1255910400,7,2253,5.045698924731183
1864238,4,B00008W64E,"I was unclear with what was the purpose of this story. What was Captain Jack trying to do? The movie flirts with a Captain Ahab theme. Is Captain Jack obsessed with a  formidable foe? Has he rejected reason for the pursuit for French ship Acheron, his Moby Dick? There are allusions to the albatross and the curse of Jonah. Another neglected theme was the relationship that developed between Lucky Jack and Dr. Stephen Maturin. The doctor has scientific ambitions that would have permitted him to beat Charles Darwin to the punch. However, each time he is promised an opportunity to explore the Galapagos, Captain Jack pulls out to pursue his military duties. The relationship briefly presents the case that our wars have prevented us from progressing as a culture. That could have been cool, but then changes direction. In the end, the cohesive theme is that Captain Jack is a superhero mariner who can do no wrong. Even during his brief displays of obsession, the crew seems to collectively roll their eyes in a knowing manner. Even when overmatched, he cannot lose. And what is the deal with the doctor and captain playing their violin and cello sideways like guitars at the end? Is this Hollywood's effort at revisionist history to bestow rock'n'roll star status to century old heroes?

Audio take full advantage of uncompressed codec very much like HBO's bluray version of Band of Brothers, there is full range of imaging that takes the viewers into the movie, rather than a distant observer: gun salvos fly from left to right, FRONT to BACK, tools and objects ring with clang of old metal alloys or wood.  One minor quip is the dialog channel is weak and needs equalization, as its often drowned out by sound effects.

The BD transfer has the flatness of movie film but details are far sharper and clearer, so many of the background elements have more detail given the higher quality of BD.  However, the BD version is far less a revolution in clarity, the DVD is still quite good.

While I know nothing of the book vs movie version, the Napoleon era nautical style and medicine I know something of.  History buffs will revel at the detailed accuracy of much of the movie, making it worth watching multiple times: small details as the knots used, the way sails are deployed, faint mumblings in the background of nautical commands as the ship in put in order, the surgical equipment and style, the dialog old English, are all period accurate with ne'er a fault, IMHO.

The deleted scenes are a shame, as its inclusion as a director's cut would have added more to the characters than the theatrical release, and are well worth viewing.  Alas, its DVD quality but marvelously done.",1253750400,11,1585,4.592198581560283

1864242,5,B00008W64E,"Okay this is one of the best sailing naval fiction movies out there. If there is a sequel hopefully with Russell Crowe, a strong Lady Lead would help the story, my circle of friends includes Katie Sackhoff whom I've met briefly at a busstop. Keira Knightly who rocks in nautical fiction in both senses of the meaning. Ashley Olsen has received a positive review from ben Kingsley lately whom would rock as Q in a bond movie. Mary Kate Olsen interests me as a strong Lady Lead for the next Aubrey adventure, Natalie Portman takes serious dramatic roles however she would excel in this part. I havre been trying to talk Pretty Brittany Ashton Holmes into returning to the big screen, Also Julia AR Morgan with the voice of an angel in front of a London Knights hockey Game of over 8000 would be great for the soundtrack or a Brent Butterworth mix of sea shanties as my friend is proficient at sampling on computer for the soundtrack. I played the Admiral in Hms Pinafore with a real sword from India, I also played Major Metcalfe in Agatha Christies the Mousetrap, and the play in 2009 with Yang Gao Zedong my Mom called Where were you the story of the Sermon on the Mount.

We get a fish eye view as she weighs anchor. We listen to her groans, creaks,sighs - literally a breathing thing.

1864246,5,B00008W64E,"I thought this is a movie for people who like action and also have an interest in observing effective, and ineffective leadership qualities in action.

On the effective side, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), the captain of HMS Suprise,  shows the qualities of an effective leader in this movie -- respect for his men, the ability to administer discipline, kindness, intelligence, as well as the ability to think about all sides of an issue before taking action.  He demonstrates how to inspire others to give their all in pursuit of a worthy cause, and shows the effective use of humor to relate to others, without becoming too familiar.

On the ineffective side, you see Hollum, one of Aubrey's midshipman, whose personal qualities and decisions make him an ineffective leader, disliked by the men, and garnering negative reviews from his captain.

The action is great -- and the Captain's ploys, deceptions and battle plans to outsmart the captain of another ship are phenomenal and intelligent.  Out gunned by a newer enemy ship, with twice the men, more guns, and a hull that can't be penetrated, Aubrey comes up with a plan that exploits his own capabilities and capitalizes on the few weaknesses of his opponent.  The battle scene is great, as is the friendship and conflict between Aubrey and the ship's Doctor.

I wish they'd made a sequel to this one -- or even a series.  I'd be a loyal fan....",1243468800,,1400,4.824267782426778

You get to know the sailors, their friendships, quirks, etc.  The young kids on board the ship was something different than most high seas films and made the movie better for it, was interesting to see. The ship fights are great and really exciting. Cool movie if the high seas on film are your thing.

The Blu-Ray: Picture quality is nothing to brag about but it is solid and many steps above the DVD. Dark scenes show grain. Other than that is does a decent job. Should have been a gorgeous movie on blu-ray though. A good 7/10 for PQ. The sound however is awesome!!! 10/10 easy.  The surrounds are active and kicking throughout the entire movie.  All the creaks of wood, gusts of wind, drops of rain, surround your room and pull you onto the ship.  Just watch the first 15 minutes of the film and you'll hear how great this soundtrack is.

I have gone through 2 discs from Amazon some months ago, a disc a while leter from Best Buys and now with my latest order received last week, I still find the same problem in the exact same place on the disc.  I'm torn in terms of keeping the disc and turnign the volume down every time I play it or returning it once again.  Anyone else experience the same problem.  In terms of Blu Ray, I have been pleased with most discs I have purchased or rented, but I have to tell you, this re-occuring problem with DTS Master HD audio has occured on other discs.

1864251,5,B00008W64E,"What a magnificent adventure story, pure and simple.

It's unusual in that there are only two action scenes over the 2 hour, 19-minute film, one near the beginning and one near the end. They don't go on that long, either. For a modern-day film, that's very unusual.

However, that doesn't translate to infer this is too talky or boring. The film will keep your interest all the way. However, for any ladies out there looking for a bit romance in this tale, it isn't there. In that respect, unless you want to ogle at Russell Crowe, this a man's film with an all-male cast.

This movie is a great demo on how to make an adventure film fascinating without blood and guts and explosions every two minutes. It's an heroic tale, right down a little boy who shows us what guts are all about. One tip for those having trouble with some of the accents or naval terminology: put on the English subtitles. You'll be glad you did.

This movie won the Academy Award for both cinematography and sound and both honors were well-deserved. The creaking of the ship coming out of all the surround speakers is awesome, just in itself. I was so pumped to see this on Blu-Ray, but the transfer wasn't much better than the regular DVD, so save your money on that one.",1237334400,,1246,4.475770925110132

1864253,3,B00008W64E,"I agree with critic Richard Leveson:  Russell Crowe does a fine job as Jack Aubrey in ""Master and Commander,"" but Paul Bettany was miscast as the brilliant, quixotic, secretive, murderous Steven Maturin.  Strange as it may seem, I believe ideal casting for the role would have been...Billy Crystal.  Only those intimate with the novels may agree with that seemingly offbeat choice, but those who are, will, and the supremely versatile Crystal could have pulled it off.
Also missing, of necessity given the plotting of the film, is the other--with Steven--most interesting character in the series:  Diana Villiers.  Dragging her, and perforce Jack's wife Sophie, into the film would change it fundamentally so having Villiers aboard is a wish beyond reality.
Given those caveats, and from one who has read the entire Aubrey/Maturian series four times and written a book about it, I still applaud the movie as a good, exciting yarn, well told.

It is about a smaller British warships' attempt to elude and eventually capture a much larger warship of Napolean's Navy.

Some of his movie roles are too tame for him, especially without the rugged appearance he has with the facial hair. Master & Commander is a great movie, especially for those who love the adventures on the sea.  I will view it over and over again, as I have Gladiators--because of Crowe.",1233360000,,552,4.5
1864256,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is bloody superb. This is a historically authentic picture (not to be mistaken for actual events and people but bits and pieces of real history sown together) takes us aboard Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) British war ship the ""HMS Surprise"". You can almost feel the sting of the frigid air and smell the salt water in this truly immersive exploit into the Napoleonic war between France and Britain. The Surprise and her crew are set in 1805 and have direct orders to hunt the French warship ""Acheron"" on the South American coast.  This is one of those rare epic movies with literally no flaws despite its grand nature. Peter Weir directs this saga of British life on the high seas and holds his cast to nothing short of impeccable acting. The battles scenes are gripping full of cannon ball explosions sending shards of wood into there victims along with fierce sword fighting. This movie is triumphant at demonstrating how difficult it was to be aboard a sea fairing ship whether an British officer or deck-hand. It conveyed well the highs and lows of moral and how punishment was swift and firm. Best of all Crowe demonstrates how a captains judgment is a tight rope leading to victory or defeat. Although only winning two Oscars this movie was nominated for ten including best picture and director only losing the other eight categories to Lord of the Rings the Return of the King (Hobbit Billy Boyd is among the cast of M&C).

Acting (Impeccable): Some of the cast members are quite young but even they deliver strong believable performances. Max Pirkis (who also gives a strong performance as the young Gaius Octavian in the hit HBO show Rome) character is young Midshipman William Blakeney which he plays with depth beyond his years. Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, who is also terrific) role demonstrates effectively how crude medical attention was but how without it many more souls would die. Bettany and Crowe relationship as captain and doctor plus friends adds many more layers to this already deep story. This leviathan of a movie has scene after a scene of deep heartfelt acting that never missed a beat or felt out of place.

Score (Brilliant): The music is a variety of selected baroque and classical pieces some of which are played by the highly noted Yo-Yo Ma. This score hits the nail on the head throughout the whole sea faring adventure. The music does an eloquent job of setting the tone of each scene enhancing the overall mode whether hopeful or depressed. It's one of my all time favorite scores.

Wardrobe/effects (Realistic): The outfits are varied and printed out to the exact detail from the British officers, able shipman, Royal Marines to the French navel outfits of the time. The ship looks spectacular whether in calm or rough seas. The cannon exchange from ship to ship is exhilarating due to the high quality effects maintained in this picture. Be warned there will be blood (no pun intended) in the battle scenes not a movie for younger viewers.

Last take (solid purchase): This is a must see for all lovers of Patrick O'Brian books (this story was taken from several of his books), Horatio Hornblower, Russel Crowe, or lovers of an epic British driven Navel adventure. No female cast or campy love story thrown into this movie but there also wasn't any need for one when keeping to historical accuracy. Did I mention must see?",1233273600,2,3406,4.815384615384615
1864257,4,B00008W64E,"As an example of the ""action film"" genre, this is superb.  However, it does not go very much past that.  The two naval battle scenes between the tall ships in the time of Napoleon and the Regency are certainly realistic, frighteningly so.  If this has ever been done better on film, I'm unaware of it.

The sailing ships look right, complicated and untidy.  The stunts are perfect, dangerous.  The acting is okay so far as the script allows.  But somehow I wanted to know more about the motivation, especially of the English captain, played by Russell Crowe.  He is dogged in his pursuit of the French enemy, exceeding his orders by pursuing the foe vessel around Cape Horn and far up the west coast of South America.  The action starts in medias res, so we did not get to see the beginning of the voyage--or know how long the crew had been together--or what their motives were.  In short, I think the filmaker needed to move a bit closer inside the men.

This is worth seeing for the action and special effects, the same reason the last Titanic film was worth a look.  I suppose the mayhem is enough for many.  I sometimes wish it were for me.",1232755200,,1144,4.4423076923076925

While the acting by all the major characters was fantastic; and the cinematography that so beautifully captured that time in history; the surround sound recording of the creaks and groans of an old ship, the sound of swords clashing, the bang of canons along with such realistic sounds of a storm at sea; all contributed to making this film a rare work of art.

Intense color contrasts and crushing, almost overwhelming sound makes this one of the best adventure films you'll ever see.  While the majority of the story follows the ""Far Side of the World"" book, it also is interspliced with scenes that are found in earlier series books.  This doesn't interfere with the screenplay, but only enhances the opportunity to get to know the characters better.  One can only hope that another movie based on these books is being considered.  The casting is superb and contains an eye for detail that the screenwriter caught perfectly.

Set in the early 19th Century during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) and the crew of the British warship HMS Surprise embark on a mission to intercept and destroy the French privateer Acheron. After narrowly escaping their first encounter with heavy damages and casualties, Captain Aubrey continues the pursuit of his powerful adversary into the Pacific Ocean. Directed by Peter Weir (Witness & The Truman Show), ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is an outstanding well-crafted epic movie that successfully combines great storytelling and strong human drama. The visual effects are terrific. The climatic sea battle sequence is thrilling and very entertaining. Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany deliver great performances. ""Master and Commander"" was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.

The Blu-Ray release of ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" misses its mark. The 2003 war drama is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is certainly a noticeable improvement over the DVD but unfortunately it isn't a solid choice to show off your High-Def television.

1864267,4,B00008W64E,"MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD stars Russell Crowe as Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, master and commander of the 'HMS Surprise,' on war patrol during the first worldwide war of the Napoleonic era (1805). Crowe is perfectly cast as Aubrey, an intelligent, erudite captain who can both inspire and lead his men with fairness and firmness, only occasionally resorting to the knout.

MASTER AND COMMANDER is gorgeously done, the ships are authentically recreated, and the atmosphere of the film never thins. For anyone familiar with the history of seafaring conditions in those days, the film is somewhat sparse in showing us the true underside of life before the mast on board a late eighteenth century/early 19th century British man-o'-war: A stinking, dirty, dark, dank, impossibly cramped and crowded space most often painted red to hide the bloodstains from work wounds, war wounds, and fights. Compared to the reality, the 'Surprise' might as well be the 'Mauretania,' but beyond this lapse, the film is an honest portrayal. Sailors, be they professional, military, or recreational, will love it.

Some reviewers have derided this film as being ""boring."" It is not. However, a drawback of making accurate films about the Age of Sail is that a jack tar's life in those years was defined by backbreaking, repetitive daily labor altogether adding up to long stretches of ennui, punctuated by short, incredibly violent and bloody exchanges with the enemy. To be an honest portrayal, a film cannot find its way around this central fact.

Captain Aubrey and his crew and ship, including his friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a surgeon and naturalist, are attacked by the French battle ship 'Acheron.' After being trounced, Captain Aubrey becomes as obsessed as Melville's Ahab with hunting down the adversary, and takes his vessel around Cape Horn, into the Southern Ocean, the Pacific, and to the Galapagos Islands to meet battle.

While at the Galapagos, Maturin discovers dozens of new species of life and formulates a theory regarding the origin of these species, but the demands of the service call the 'Surprise' away before he can collect specimens or coalesce his ideas, leaving it to Darwin to do so not many years later.

As the film closes, the 'Surprise' continues on her war patrol, leaving the door open for a sequel.

1864270,5,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir is amazing. Utterly and absolutely amazing.

In the first 2 or 3 minutes of the movie, the only sound is the ocean. No music. No dialogue. Nothing loud. Simply the gentle susurration of the water. And yet, such an amazing amount of information is conveyed in that short period of time.

The opening volley - in the quite literal sense - was shocking. Completely shocking in its violence, its comprehensiveness. Even watching it tonight, for the n-th time, I am jolted from the mild, placid tension to a breathtaking, gut-clenching cringe from the screen. Yes, a feat of CGI; but the actual choice of imagery is the wonder.

People can drone on about the `accuracy' or `authenticity' of the visual presentation (sure, I can be one of them). But the more amazing feat is the astonishing amount of the story which is told without words. Either in a simple visual manner, such as the initial minutes of the film, or as a miscellaneous background, a subliminal presentation, such as the dinner with the captain in the middle of the film where he announces the Galapagos Is. as their destination. It isn't the dialogue here, but the simple manner in which the dinner occurs, with singing and drinking and drinking with everyone having a crewman behind his chair, with the absolute absence of any women (there are 2 on screen for about 30 seconds while they're picking up stuff in Brazil).

It is the manner in which Weir frames the dialogue, with images and motion, and music which make the film so powerful.

I've read all of O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin novels, and several of his others. (Did you know he wrote Bedknobs and Broomsticks??) When I realized ""Far Side of the World"" was being made into a movie, I swore in delight. I then swore in frustration. If I decide to see an adapted screenplay, I avoid reading the book, if possible. It lets me take the film on its own merits. I was only on no. 8; Far Side of the World is no. 10. I had to put off reading the rest of the novels for a year and a half. Argh!

Quite a bit is missing; several bits are from other novels in the series. E.g., Ensign Hollum jumps ship with the gunner's wife, whom he's gotten pregnant (she's not in the book). Dr. Maturin does name some huge tortoise after Capt. Aubrey, but it's a few novels earlier when they're somewhere in the Indian Ocean.  Bits & pieces from other parts are in the movie, obviously taking the entire opus as the field from which to pick the best phrases or images.

With the whole concept of framing the story, the entire story is on ship, with a brief respite on the Galapagos Is. There is no world outside of the crew. And yet, with such a small, enclosed space, it is presented as just that, a world within itself. This will assuredly remain one of my favorite movies of all time. The judgment of which is whether or not I'll buy the next-generation of video medium (blue-ray HD DVD whatever).

The extra disc of ""extras"" is amusing and informative.  It's quite long, giving you an opportunity to spend another couple of hours watching it.  It's a pleasant addition to understanding how the movie was made, especially with Wier's discussion.

1864272,4,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander"" manages to compress two marvelous novels into one marvelous film. Captain ""Jack"" Aubrey (Russell Crowe in a marvelous performance) and the crew of the Surprise pursue a French warship in Atlantic waters. Out gunned and out classed by a heavier, faster ship, Aubrey is determined to take down the French raider before it takes down another of Her Majesty's Ships. This pursuit will cost his crew, his ship but must be done to keep the waters safe for other vessels.

The most important question is whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray because of improved picture quality. While ""Master and Commander"" does look better than the standard DVD and many scenes look truly exceptional, the film looks a bit uneven overall. Could the transfer have been better? Absolutely but owning this on Blu-ray comes down to how much you love/like this film. I suspect that the same original HD master was used for this a couple of years back. It looks extremely good but not as brilliant as I had hoped.

Sharp direction by Weir, a masterfully adapted script by Weir and John Colee makes this harrowing sea adventure a worthwhile trip. Weir adds a powerful cinematic flair with the sharp camera work of Russell Boyd. Unlike a lot of previous adventures at sea, the fluid camera work adds to the sense of menace and danger that Aubry and his crew feel.

The extras are similar to the original single disc DVD which is a bit disappointing especially considering how much Fox is charging for their Blu Ray discs (particularly compared to Warner). All the extras are in high definition which is good news. We get deleted scenes, a historical and geographical trivia track, a pop up map showing you where the H.M.S. Surprise is at any given moment, the theatrical trailer and the ability to search and save your favorite scenes.

There's no commentary track nor are there any featurettes on the making of the film. Considering this IS a Blu-Ray disc, I'd expect the featurettes from the deluxe DVD edition of the film if nothing else but, sadly, we don't get it. I suspect we'll see a Blu-Ray double dip shortly.

I can recommend the movie on Blu-ray simply because it has a superb looking transfer with nice detail and without the over use of digital clean up (a problem for ""Patton"" which is one of the worst looking Blu-Ray's I've seen--not because of the image itself but because of the overuse of digital tools to clean up the film creating waxy looking skin textures, loss of general detail and adding an unnecessary digital ""look"" to the film to eliminate film grain).",1215820800,6,2600,4.743362831858407
1864273,5,B00008W64E,"Why there has been no sequel to this film baffles me.  It is an almost perfect depiction of life at sea during the Napoleanic Wars, and better yet, a multifaceted study of the human condition.  The acting and action is superb, the plot unerring, and if you love GREAT surround sound, it is as good as it gets.  I just wish they would continue the series.  If they can make 3 Spiderman films, why won't they continue this far more interesting vein?",1215561600,,447,4.414634146341464
1864274,5,B00008W64E,"This movie is hands down one of the best of the last decade.

I'm not one to rate movies, but far too many people are too quick to judge this film. I, like many, went into this movie expecting a swashbuckling thriller, only to find a much more thoughtful piece. The pacing is measured, but perfect for the story - one which is more about 19th century sailing and the bonds of friendship than swords and cannons. Like other movies by Weir, including Gallipoli (I believe this movie to be far superior to that more widely hailed film), it is hard to place this in a single category.

That's not to say there is no action. The movie has quite possibly the most visceral and entertaining ship-to-ship combat scene I have ever seen. This caps a movie that is incredibly detailed and beautiful to watch. Everything from the wardrobe to the knots is near perfect in representing this period, creating an understanding of the place and times that is truly unique. The inherent beauty of 19th century sailing, the dramatic landscape of the Galapagos and the incredible cinematography make for a truly awe-inspiring movie. Add to all this the incredible sound effects and the absolutely perfect score (just go buy the soundtrack, performed by Yo-Yo Ma), and you have a complete viewing experience.

Yet all of this would be for naught if not for the incredible acting of this movie. Crowe and Bettany give succinct and underplayed performances, making their characters truly live. Similar kudos go to all involved, from the recognizable Billy Boyd to a number of relatively unknown actors who make even the smallest roles perfect (witness the character of the young Mr. Blakely or the grizzled, gregarious sailing master).

Historically accurate (this coming from a trained historian), beautiful to the senses and well acted, this movie has become one of my all-time favorites. Admittedly, having mixed reactions after first viewing because of its admittedly slow storyline and accurate recreation of shipboard life, I now watch this movie at least once a month. Just buy the darn thing.

**Just a word on the extras: they are good, but they really didn't blow me away. In regards to how the film was made, they are impressive, but there isn't much on the history or even on the author. It's really a shame, since this movie deserved so much more.

The picture quality is pretty good as well,I'll have to agree and disagree with other reviewers here. Yes Fox most recent blu's have had pretty bad picture quality(AVP2,Hitman,Predator)even Independence Day was a disapointment but having said that there is nothing wrong with the picture with Master and Commander,at times its as good as anything out. I think it has to do alot with the color the film was shot and the general fim source whenever it doesn't look its best. As I look at it right now a scene in the ship within the first 30min.were the two young shipmates bring a model of the enemy ship to the captain I though wow thats as good as anything I got on Blu. Yes the special features are bare but there are two pretty cool things. First there is a map you can look at anytime in the film to see the ship's position relative to the world and second and really good fact track that runs during the film.

1864284,4,B00008W64E,"From the opening cannon battle's visceral sound design you know you're in for a treat with this dts-HD Master Audio presentation from Fox. For several years now we've had high resolution digital audio for our music, but only over the last two years has it finally hit the video market. Master and Commander on DVD was a disc I was impressed with for the quality of the 768Mbps dts track, but good Lord the improvement of this Blu-ray track is seven-fold. I continue to be impressed by the sound quality on Fox's discs, including Independence Day, I, Robot, The Day After Tomorrow, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and now Master and Commander. This is what home theatre is about! All speakers are in use here and the directionality is spot on. I truly believe I have cannons beside my sofa, powerful, heavy cannons. Not for the faint of heart is this one at reference level volumes.

Where picture quality is concerned there are one or two scenes that I did find to be not eye-popping, but these are few and far between. On the DVD release of Master and Commander there are many scenes in the ship under-deck that are a mess, with mpeg-noise all over the place, a shortcoming of DVD's bandwidth. On the Blu-ray Disc you'll find no such errors. The level of detail watching this movie on a 1080p plasma is incredible and there are no complaints whatsoever of the day scenes. Although this will not compare when stood beside the sheen of I, Robot, one of the most incredible pictures I've experienced so far on Blu-ray, it definitely is a huge improvement over its DVD counterpart.

Fox have made very little effort here with the extras, but have included D-Box functionality for those with a bit more money to spend on their theatre seating. That is not something I can afford so I can't comment on it, but D-Box tracks are starting to catch the attention of the other studios and you will see Disney or Sony Blu-ray's coming soon with D-Box tracks. If you want to go more into the history of the time there are numerous special features on the DVD, but with the movie already running 137 minutes this is one reviewer that has yet to ever pop in that second disc, ever. Missing out on porting over the DVD extras is something a lot of reviewers, amateur and professional, gripe about. I do not care for extras if they are in standard definition. I have all three of the Lord of the Rings Platinum Edition 4-DVD sets, I bought them because of the 6.1 dts:es tracks and the extended footage. That amounts to 6 DVD's that have never been released from their plastic teeth. I will likely watch some of them when the inevitable Blu-ray Disc versions come out if they are in 1080p, but otherwise I just don't have the time to watch that much extra footage about each movie I buy. Master and Commander is a pretty incredible movie with excellent performances all round and the subject matter is interesting, but when the movie's over, turn out the lights.

I dock Fox 1-star for not including the extras for those that have never bought the original DVD, but this release for the sheer improvement of audio and picture quality and being able to enjoy this on a large screen that even the best up-converter for DVD's cries beside, gets 4-stars.

For those wishing to wait for the ""inevitable"" double dip, consider renting this title from your local Blockbuster or Netflix, you'll not be disappointed.

 And we come away thinking that this was not an easy life.

The mix of action and human drama is very entertaining. Thrilling battle scenes, yes, but the movie is not about this ship chasing that ship. Its about the relationships of the men. Because on a ship what did they have?, they had other people. The relationship most explored is the one between the captain and the doctor. They are friends, yes, but have different views on some things.

 The acting is fantastic. Crowe is charismatic, and its fun to watch him shift from strong leader to jolly captain. This captain cares about his men and Crowe can show it with just a look in his eyes. Bettany and Pirkis are wonderful too.

1864295,4,B00008W64E,"While most movies depicting the rigors of war and battle these days focus on either the glory of heroism or the gore of wounds inflicted, MASTER AND COMMANDER focuses instead on a more realistic aspect. That is to say it combines both of these depictions of war, never truly making one or the other seem the way it was. And I believe that that is what it would actually boil down to; a combination of the physical and emotional scars of war as well as the admiration of men of courage.

The story takes place in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is in command of the H.M.S. Surprise with instructions to ferret out the Acheron, a French ship that has been wreaking havoc off the coast of South America. With a hardy crew and a combination of battle scarred and fresh faced officers, they set out to do the task they were assigned.

But rather than wait till half way through the film to have these two adversaries confront one another, the film nearly opens with a full blown sea battle. But this one is unlike most offered in films from the past. The glowing heroics of jumping from ship to ship, the always missing cannonballs, the smiling faces are replaced with a more realistic atmosphere.

The Surprise is caught off guard and pelted with cannon fire, ripping the ship apart. The battle is not so much fought using guns and swords as it is using tactics and maneuvering. A combination of these two (as well as the fog bank from which the Acheron was able to launch its attack) and the ship and crew are saved. Broken but not yet destroyed, Aubrey and his crew set out to find the Acheron while making repairs as they go.

With this adrenaline rush completed for the viewer, we are now offered a glimpse into the real life that was found at sea. The daily routine of making sure the ship was taken care of, the talking between the ships crew that eventually leads to the death of one of the officers, the camaraderie of the crew who would follow their captain to hell and back and yet would never consider sharing more than a cursory glance at the officers. These were two separate classes brought together for a common cause, but that never made them friends.

And yet when a kind word or situation presents itself, it is offered. The deeds and misdeeds of those on board bring about a closeness between this group and they rise to the task before them.

Not only does this story present itself (more in visual deed than in word), the observations of the ship's doctor, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) towards his friend and commander are seen. The pair shares an interest in classical musicianship and an interest in the crew. But while Aubrey feels the need for battle and to rid the seas of his countries enemy, Maturin takes the more intellectual approach, voicing his opinion that rest is needed, that time should be taken rather than pursue the Acheron. Some might see this as a metaphor for the recent battles in Congress over the war in Iraq. That could be said. But I saw this more as the question that all men ask before launching into war. And the answers are never simple nor easily made.

There is an underlying complexity to the character of Aubrey that Crowe brings forth. While he longs to face his enemy and to win, he also cares deeply for his ship and for its crew. His desire to win may cause him to make a wrong decision now and then, but deep down he would never put his men in the face of danger if he were not convinced he could save them.

A final face off is inevitable but to reveal who wins would not only be a tremendous spoiler but would take away the effect it has on the viewer. Suffice to say that the movie truly never quite has an ending. But in a good way, not a ""here we go again"" one.

The movie depicts the life of a sailor in these times in more realistic fashion than any movie I've seen before. While we are usually given old sea faring gents, this one shows us a combination of men who have no where else to go mingling with young lads who long for adventure. The range of ages was exactly that in those days.

While a single hole in a ship meant a fast sinking vessel in most movies, this one shows that repairs could be and were made. The ships were not that easy to down. But it also allows us to see the damage caused by the cannonballs that slammed hard into the ship, inflicting more human damage than they could to the ship.

While a sobering look at sea warfare, the movie also has its lighter moments. It also offers a testament to the human spirit as well. But most importantly it offers us something sorely lacking in today's world, something that has bothered me tremendously. It offers us a hero. A steadfast man capable of making mistakes but owning up to them and then rallying his troops to face off against a common enemy. The world lacks heroes these days. Perhaps we will only find them in film. But at least a new generation will have the chance to have that hero.",1205539200,3,4971,4.392391304347826
1864296,5,B00008W64E,"P.O'Brian had his breakthrough as a writer of high literature in an unusual genre for his level of sophistication in the 90s, when he was about 80 years old. Hollywood bought movie rights then, but it took another decade before this movie came out.
For me, it was my first encounter with a phenomenon that has given me many hours of pleasure since. I had known of Aubrey and Maturin since a while, but never read any of the books, nor any of POB's other books (interesting novels and biografies, and excellent short stories). After watching the movie, I picked up the first volume of the series and was hooked instantly. Great stuff.

A faithful adaptation by Weir, the movie accurately captures the essence of all of O'Brian's books.  O'Brian's masterpiece is more about human relationships, with a sprinkling of action and not the other way around.

While some may find the movie ""slow"" or ""boring"" it is because this is not really a so called war picture.  For those anticipating a high budget action film like Pirates of the Caribbean, it is certainly not at all like that.  Rather, this film focuses on the customs, language, history and culture of the time and involves a clever cat and mouse game between Crowes's Jack Aubrey and a French Frigate Captain.

For those who may consider passing up this film because of a lack of action, the film opens with a brief but extremely intense battle scene that shows the horrors of early 19th century naval warfare.  The film also has a dramatic ending and features many intense moments that will leave the viewer eager for more.

Peter Weir, director of 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, disrupts this trend with his skillful use of Crowe as the captain of a British warship in 1805, during the first war with Napoleon.  A French privateer ship called the Acheron is to be stopped by the British warship HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain Jack ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey.  The two ships chase each other all over the Southern Atlantic Ocean and in doing so, provide an excellent look at what life was like aboard a 19th century warship.  The harsh realities of the day-to-day grind, the fierce seas, the constant danger of attack, and the political struggles involving the ship's leadership - all make important contributions to this adventure story, which keeps the audience on the edges of their seats during its entire 138 minute runtime.

The director's efforts to reproduce the realistic environment in which a sailor of the British fleet would find himself during the early 1800s are evident from the sheer volume of detail that is included in this picture.  Production designer William Sandell, and set decorator Robert Gould successfully manage to recreate the 19th century British style of decoration down to the smallest possible details.  The attempt to portray the events realistically does not end there as Weir has the actors covered in grime, grease, sweat, and filth, in contrast to the traditional Hollywood attempts at glossing over the grittier elements of film settings.

The audience is able, through this movie, to experience the same awe and wonderment as those of the period must have experienced upon discovering all of the treasures in the New World.

The film is about as realistic in setting as one could make it. There are a few inconsistencies in the sailing, but only noticeable to an experienced sailor - they don't take away from the film anyway.

The film catches the right balance between focusing on the crew and its adventures and daily life, versus the Napoleonic Wars. In otherwords, no need to be a student of that period to understand or appreciate the movie.
There is no romance, which has probably hurt the film in terms of broad popularity; perhaps in the same sense of the movie ""Tora Tora Tora !"" from the 70s. It was one of the best war films ever made (subjective, I know:). Point is, both are 'limited' by lack of romance in their plots. The two share excellent settings and historical research.

I will point out that M&C distinctively shows the antecedents of 'modern' military leadership: the Capt must balance his personal ambitions with care for the crew, he must coach the young midshipmen (Hollom, Blakeney, Callamy, etc), and use a persuasion to get the sailing master and more experienced Officers and crew to follow him in dire situations. This sort of shows the development of ""leadership principles"" as used today.

This is the backdrop of Master and Commander who fights for England with his brave crew and stout ship against France on the far side of the world.

Russell Crowe heads a first rate cast that replays a genre that hasn't been seen since Gregory Peck played the title role of ""Horatio Hornblower."" From a consistent script and story, one gets the impression of what life was like on the high seas during this time and how quickly, silently, and deadly mortal danger could arise. There was no sonar or radar save those in one's sight, hearing and judgment. And the fog could be one's enemy as much as it could be a friend.

Besides the acting, the music lent perfectly to the story, and one can recognize Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 played by Yo Yo Ma. My favorite was Boccherini's La Musica Notturna Della providing the background for captain's order to beat to ""General Quarters.""

You remember those old 'tales on the high seas' brought to you on the silver screen way back in the day? Of course you don't, that was much too long ago, but thank goodness for TCM! I'm talking about movies like ""Captain Blood"". Now there was a good one, a classic sea faring adventure if there ever was one. Long before the days of Captain Jack and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" hollywood used to really know how to give us a swashbuckling adventure. Those days have, for a short time, returned.

When you've watched ""Master and Commander"" you feel like you've really been there in a story told of about 120 years ago, when the French and the English we're at war, in the times of Napolean. While the foot soldier held his ground in Europe, on the far side of the world there we're battleships and Man of war's battling it out for supremacy of the seas. That's what this movie is about, just a small glimpse of the little wooden world of planks, rigging and cannon held together by Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey of His Majesty's Royal Navy.

Peter Weir directs this beautifully crafted work, a historical adventure of what war of the time was really like. Not just a mundane historical account you understand, this adventure explores the lives of the men on board, their stories, friendships, struggles of course, and their encounters with the French Man of war, The Acheron. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) has orders to sink, burn or take the Acheron a prize. In doing this he leads his crew into the unexplored waters around the southern tip of South America to the unknown Islands of the Galapagos. A really beautiful backdrop to this story. The acting is superb with Russel Crowe giving one of his top performances along side Paul Bettany as supporting actor among others. The scenery is teriffic, costumes spectacular and the web of all the little sub-stories is immaculate. Its really a joy to watch and one of my favorite movies of all time. There are just not enough movies like this around, and to be so well made makes it a true find, well not really a find since it garnered 10 nominations for Academy Awards back in 2003. The art direction is particularly good as it did manage to take home an Oscar for Cinematography that year. The music is one of the best film scores I've heard in ages, and I like how they weaved the two main players, Russel Crowe and Paul Bettany's, scenes playing the violin and bass into the actual music score (even though the playing is not actually from the two, I think the sound editors did a fine job matching it).

If I could give this film 6 stars I would. It's just that well made! So much detail could be written about this movie, but that would just be teribbly monotanous, so I'll simply say watch this movie!",1185494400,2,2955,4.507462686567164

IN A NUTSHELL: DELIVERED A SENSE OF SUSTAINED EXPECTATION FROM BEGINNING TO END

It is delightful for see an action adventure feature film that so precisely brings us to a world far away from our times and places. We see and feel a lot here and this film is in no hurry to rush to the climax as one is very likely to be hooked after the first scene.

WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT:

'MASTER AND COMMANDER: The Far Side of the World', Directed by Peter Weir is a film based on two novels of the same names, set in the Napoleanic War by author Patrick O'Brian. Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.

From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy. The ship, the sea, the men and the suspense of the unknown are thick throughout the opening scene which effectively sets the tone for the entire film.

Fabulous View from the Crowe's Nest

I avoided ""Master and Commander"" for awhile, unwilling to face disappointment. The movie looked cool, and with the ever-admirable Russell Crowe at the helm, seemingly a sure winner. But what if it was terrible?

I finally faced my fear and found to my delight that ""Master and Commander"" is a wonderfully rich and varied experience that was well worth the wait. The film's action is fairly straightforward. An English man-o-war, the ""Surprise,"" must intercept the much swifter and stronger French ""Acheron"" before it reaches the Pacific and spreads Napoleon's empire into that hemisphere. But to this basic period chase story is added a fast-paced plot, a wonderful cast, superb effects, excellent performances and more twists than a cat-o-nine. Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, a brave and audacious pilot who has spent much of his life aboard the Surprise. The boat is well past its prime, but Audrey knows how to squeeze every ounce of speed out of her. Paul Bettany shines, or rather glowers as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is a cynic, an old friend of Aubrey's and the ship's talented surgeon, whose land-bound habits and moral code make him a perfect foil for Crowe. When the two aren't fighting each other, they are playing classical strings pieces in the Captain's cabin.

""Master and Commander"" masterfully mixes disparate are elements - the sailors' superstitions and their Christian piety when burying at sea; their fighting prowess alongside their tenderness toward their sick comrades; their love of grog along their dogged will to work. The film includes a number of scenes and characters that could easily have descended into clich: the amputation; the noble-yet-caring captain; the encounter with native women. But smart writing and a focus on the mission keep both the Surprise's crew and the film's plot focused. Special applause goes to Max Pirkis as a doughty young midshipman. Sharp-eyed viewers will also note Billy Boyd (filmed in the midst of his role as Pippin in ""The Lord of the Rings"") as a rambunctious coxswain.

M&C is quick-footed and thrilling, with battle scenes that are breathtakingly brutal. The effects of cannon shot on a ship's hull have never been so convincingly rendered. The camaraderie among the crew is heartwarming and sincere. The plot line is far from predictable. And finally, a movie that does not insult a viewer's intelligence! The film's final shot tells us, without needing to show us, what happens as the credits are rolling. Terrific, terrific, terrific!

1864321,4,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is the magnificent movie dramatization of the characters of Patrick O'Brian's Naval novels.

Set in the Napoleonic Wars, the storyline is built around the pursuit by British Royal Navy Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey and his ship, HMS Surprise, of the French warship ""Acheron"".  The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.

Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.

The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.  The sequences at sea, whether rounding the Horn in horrendous weather or boarding an enemy vessel, are thrilling and well-executed.

1864324,5,B00008W64E,"Is the ""modest"" British warship, the ""Surprise"", hunting a far more powerful French frigate? or is Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew the prey?

Based on the novels (which I have not read), this movie version is a superbly made story for the screen. I feel like I'm one of those people who loved Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies, but never read Tolkien's books! Apparently, fans of the M&C novels are emotionally divided over this film version, just like fans of TLOTR books are over the movies. But I have to join those who feel that Master and Commander (the movie) must be an excellent adaptation of books to film.

The single feature, I have to admit, which made me buy this DVD, is the inclusion in the film score of Ralph Vaughan Williams's, ""Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis"", used twice in the film when the pathos of death is invoked. It brings me close to tears whenever I listen to the entire tone poem; and heard during emotionally wrenching moments in M&C, it did bring me to tears. So, ""Gotta have it!""

I especially enjoyed the ""ship captain and his doctor friend"" relationship: so familiar to Star Trek (the OS) fans. It seems like a perenial pairing of opposite personality types. And Russell Crowe's captain to Paul Bettany's doctor are the central character dynamic that powers this story. They both admire each other, have a gulf-wide difference in what motivates their careers (which is at odds: the captain feels the doctor's scientific interests are mere ""hobbies""); and share a penchant for chamber music (which some members of the crew endure with muted agony).

1864326,5,B00008W64E,"Were it not for Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, this film would have - should have - won the Academy Award for Best Picture.  While O'Brien fans may quibble about how closely the details align with the novels, this is an outstanding picture in nearly every respect.  From Crowe (as Captain Jack Aubrey) on down, the acting is superb, believable, and effecting.  In the title role, Crowe manifests - in both demonstrative action and subtle coaching - the attributes of leadership, rich in this film.  Costumes, editing and cinematography are outstanding.  Uniforms, equipment, weapons, food (yes, including weevils) take you to His Britannic Majesty's navy of the early 19th Century.

The story line is a good balance of edge-of-the-seat action to quieter, reflective moments examining superstition, duty, conscience and character.  The scene as HMS Surprise ""rounds the Horn"" is harrowing, leaving the viewer to wonder, How did men in such ships sail the world?  Doctor and naturalist Stephan Maturin (played by Paul Bettany) contrasts the dutiful Jack Aubrey with conscience and not an insignificant biological insight that inspires Aubrey and HMS Surprise to its final victory.

I saw this movie in the theater three times, on each occasion glimpsing something more, something different.  In addition to the film itself, the Collector's Edition includes a fine documentary on the 19th Century Royal Navy and other ""extras"".  The movie Captain Horatio Hornblower (1952; Gregory Peck) and the 8-part AE Series, both based on C.S. Forester's novels, are superb in their own way.

Master and Commander is a CLASSIC look at life aboard a ship-of-war at the dawnings of the 19th century Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe is superb in his role as Capt Jack Aubrey.  But I would think that 13-year old Max Pirkis as Midshipman Lord Blakeney, came neigh close to stealing the entire show!  He is marvelous and for his feat of rendering an endearing and sensitive portrayal of the courageous one-armed Boy-Officer, this movie rates 5-stars. Pirkis is fabulous!  Oh yes, do not forget to CRY when his best boyhood friend, Midshipman Calamy is killed in battle.  It is a VERY sad scene which will haunt the viewer for a long time.

I purchased the DVD and each subsequent viewing has demonstrated that the creators of the film brought a true and loving adaptation of the books to the screen.  It's wonderfully directed and acted, and the screenplay does justice to the vernacular of the period.  The cinematography is incredible, the battle and sailing sequences being as realistic as can be imagined. The gore is restrained, much being inferred rather than easy in your face approach usually taken these days. The soundtrack is exceptional, and the violin\cello duets utilized to illustrate the camaraderie between Aubrey and Maturin demonstrate the keen interest in culture and knowledge that are such an important aspect of these two characters.

1864333,5,B00008W64E,"Russell Crowe (Capt. Jack Aubrey) stars in this classic sea epic about naval warfare during the Napoleonic wars.  The year is 1805 and Napoleon's armies are set to invade England.  The world's oceans have now become battlefields as well.  The French frigate Acheron has been sent to the South Atlantic Ocean to journey around South America and into the Pacific Ocean to raid English whaling vessels.

Capt. Aubrey's vessel, the HMS Surprise, stands in the Acheron's way.  After a battle off of the Brazillian coast in which the Surprise suffered considerable damage, the French ship made good its escape.  Faster than its English counterpart, it is able to increase the distance between itself and the slower British ship.

During the course of the movie, the viewer gets to experience sailing, sea tactics, and life in general aboard a sailing ship.  Young officers who were in fact pre-teenage children were routinely placed aboard these vessels to learn the art of seamanship from the more experienced crewmembers.  Capt. Aubrey lends in his navigational talents to the training.  Battles are ferocious and often deadly, and young and old alike are the unfortunate casualties.  The overcrowding, poor food, and mental stress of being cramped on a ship for months on end is accurately portrayed, as well.  However, the men are sustained by the thrill of the chase and moments of courage, especially by Capt. Aubrey.

Tough choices are made as well, such as when one of the crewmembers is swept overboard, but Capt. Aubrey is forced to make the agonizing decision to leave him behind rather than risk his ship and crew.

Starring along with Crowe is Paul Bettany, who plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  He provides a kind of antithesis to Capt. Aubrey's sense of duty.  The pair play music together, eat together, and get drunk together, and there is a true sense of trust and friendship among them.  While chasing the Acheron, the Surprise stops in the Galapagos islands, where Dr. Maturin discovers many different species of animals, but Capt. Aubrey informs the doctor that the Surprise must resume the pursuit of the Acheron.  This decision drives a wedge between the Captain and the doctor.

Upon sighting the Acheron, Capt. Aubrey comes up with a plan to disguise his ship as a whaling vessel in the hopes of drawing the bigger and heavier-armed Acheron closer.  The plan works, and a teriffic sea battle ensues.  Will the Acheron win, or will Aubrey's Surprise pull of a ""surprise"" of its own?

This is an excellent movie.  The action is non-stop, and Russell Crowe does a magnificent job as the charismatic Capt. Aubrey.  Life aboard a sailing ship in the early 1800s is accurately shown, and the sea battles are truly exhilarating.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Fans of great sea action and adventure will surely enjoy this great movie.",1163635200,,2876,4.9519832985386225

1864335,5,B00008W64E,"I had admired Master and Commander as a fine film when I saw it in the theater.  We rented the standard widescreen DVD of the set, and fell further in love with it, and tended to leave it on when one of the cable channels was rebroadcasting it.  So I wound up buying a copy of the super-genius deluxe edition.

It's a 2-disc set.  The first disc is identical to the standard edition release.  Interestingly there's no director's commentary -- leaving Weir as one of the few filmmakers who wants to have the film speak for itself.

The second disc is chock full of behind-the-scenes features, much of which concentrates on the phenomenal levels of effort that were required to synthesize much of the footage in the movie.  The CGI team worked with a life-sized recreation of a 19th century tall ship, a ""bigature"" (very large miniature) in a tank, footage taken as a Captain Cook recreation sailed around Cape Horn, and a batch of other stuff.  Weir started off committed to trying to make the thing look and feel as realistic as possible, and it becomes clear from the featurettes on model shots, CGI work and sound design that there isn't a thing on the screen that Weir didn't want to be there.  His group's fanatical attention to detail reminds me of the behind the scenes work of Akira Kurosawa's team at its very finest.  And each reviewing of the movie brings out more levels of detail (even as the illusion has been broken -- no, that's not really a guy being left behind in a storm at Cape Horn, though I was fooled in the theater), including the interesting characterization of Lord Blakeney as the sort of ""fighting naturalist"" that he mentions in the film -- part man-of-action as Aubrey is, part contemplative man-of-science as Maturin is.  Too bad there are no plans for a sequel; I for one would love to see how Blakeney turns out.

For devotees of the film, filmmaking and Peter Weir, this is more than worth the money and an essential part of our library.",1163116800,10,1971,4.568181818181818

1864338,5,B00008W64E,"Given the number of excellent movies that have been made about sailing ships and the breadth of coverage of those movies, at first you might wonder how yet another movie is going to add anything to the genre. If you have seen this movie you need no answer to that question. This story is as compelling as ""Moby Dick,"" and the captain of H.M.S. Surprise is just as driven as Captain Ahab, though generally not mad as was Ahab.

The story at first appears to be a classic story of a strategic sea chase between two captains. However, it cannot be, for the pursuer and the pursued frequently change position, and the English pursuer is the weaker of the two opponents. In order to have any chance against an enemy with longer range guns, more speed, and a nearly impenetrable hull, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) will need luck, bravery, and a superb strategy. Fortunately all three will eventually work in his favor, at least sufficiently to make a grand finish to this movie.

Three things set this movie apart from its predecessors.

First, the detail in this movie is incredibly good. The research into the conditions about a sailing ship of this era was apparently quite extensive as the details in the operation of the ship were numerous. Details regarding the relationships between the officers and crew also appeared quite authentic, recalling from my dim past the book ""Two Years Before the Mast."" While it would be easy to dismiss the attention to detail, that very detail makes much of this movie a delight to watch.

Secondly, the two captains were every bit as crafty as any two captains have ever been portrayed. We only see the results of the French captain's efforts, but we see the result of those efforts on Captain Aubrey, and we realize that Captain Aubrey has met someone with a talent that is at least equal to his own. We have seen similar scenarios in movies such as ""The Enemy Below"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" and yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar, is sufficiently different that you will find the course of the movie and the ending to be different.

Third, the special effects benefit from decades of development of computer generated imagery. In the movies of days gone by the special effects would rely heavily on miniature ships floating about in a big pool. In this movie the special effects are so good that, just as in ""Jurassic Park,"" you never know when you are looking at a ship and when you are looking at computer graphics. While there are places where you can guess computer images were used, try not to focus on that aspect too much because it can distract you from the story.

Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Captain Aubrey, well supported by a similarly excellent cast. ""Master and Commander"" received ten nominations for Academy Awards in 2003, and in any other year would likely have won many more awards than the two it won, but ""The Return of the King"" overshadowed this superb historical fiction. It is gratifying to see such quality in film making. This movie is well worth five stars and then some.

Enjoy!",1158537600,,3114,4.671532846715328
1864339,5,B00008W64E,"This is a fantastic movie about the HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey, stalking the French vessell Acheron to the ""far side of the world"" during the Napoleanic era.  The filem is intricately detailed, and while I am no sailor, most of the details strike true.  I do know that the British Navy by the time of this story absolutely revered Lord Nelson, and that reverance is played out in this movie when several younger offciers ask the Captain for impressions of Nelson during one of his two meeting with the Admiral.  The cannons have names, the bells number the hours of the shipboard day.  A knotted rope line is played out to measure the ship's speed in knots.  A sounding is taken to read the depth of the sea, and sextant lessons are given to measure true noon.  In fact the level of detail is overwhelming, but the story is just as good.

The Acheron is the superior ship, and at first it seems the Captain is also superior.  He surprises the Surprise twice, once coming out of the fog at the beginning of the movie and once by hiding in an inlet and letting the Surprise chase on by.
Captain Aubry only barely manages to escape into the fog the first time, and into the night the second.

But in the end, Captain Aubrey wins out, but not before the ship and crew has made many sacrifices.

Russell Crowe's performance as Captain Jack Aubry is spectacular.  I was also immensley impressed with Max Pirkis's portrayal of young Mr. Blakeny.  The photography and camera work were absolutely first rate, as well as the tremendous attention to detail.

1864342,5,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander,"" set in the Napoleanic era and based on the books by Patrick O'Brian, is probably one of the best films--of its genre--that I have seen in years. I was sorry that it missed out at Oscar Time, as I consider it superior to ""The Lord of the Rings."" (Although I'm a dedicated fan of the ""Rings"" trilogy, this is simply a better movie.) The script is fairly good, Weir's direction is excellent, and the cast is superb. The phone-throwing bad boy, Russell Crowe, may be a hellion offscreen, but he is a wonderful actor, who conveys the spirit and essence of Captain Jack Aubrey with verve and sensitivity. Paul Bettany, another brilliant and versatile actor, portrays the scholar/humanist/ship's physician Stephen Maturin, who is also Aubrey's best mate.

Aubrey's frigate, the HMS Surprise, has been ordered to locate, and if possible, take as a prize, the Acheron, a French ship of greater size and strength. The film opens with a brief but violent skirmish between the two vessels, an encounter that leaves Aubrey with a desire for revenge, as well as the need to fulfill his mission. In the days and months that follow, ""Lucky Jack"" is forced to deal with the repairs to his damaged ship, grisly medical issues, disciplinary problems among the crewmen, a deadly storm, a suicide, and an accidental injury to Dr. Maturin--which occurs just at the moment that the elusive Acheron appears to be within reach. A rousing and realistic battle scene follows, as Aubrey uses trickery to face down the massive, more heavily armed French ship.

""Master and Commander"" captures the atmosphere of life aboard ship, and the claustrophobic environment below decks, as no other film has done, with the exception of ""Das Boot."" Some viewers complained about the ""choppy"" quality of the final fight scene's cinematography, but this ""choppiness"" serves a purpose. You actually feel as though you are standing on deck with the ship rolling beneath you, surrounded by the haphazard chaos of battle. Throughout the film Weir's use of music, as in nearly all of his movies, contributes to the emotional draw of the imagery. Excerpts from works by Boccherini, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and other composers, as well as folk tunes, are used to good effect.

In addition to remarkable performances by Crowe and Bettany, we see excellent work by virtually the entire crew. Particularly memorable are Max Pirkis as the very youthful midshipman Lord Blakeney, Lee Ingleby as the sadly insecure midshipman Hollom, James D'Arcy as Lieutenant Pullings, Robert Pugh as Mr. Allen, the sailing master, and Max Benitz as another brave young midshipman. An element of comic relief is provided from time to time by David Threlfall, as Aubrey's dour-faced steward, and Richard McCabe, as the surgeon's mate. Billy Boyd, of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame, makes an appearance as Bonden, the coxswain. Scenes between Bettany and an angel-faced young Max Pirkis are particularly appealing, as the doctor/naturalist imparts his enthusiasm for scientific discovery to an intelligent and willing pupil.

DVD extras include an entertaining documentary, ""The Hundred Days,"" and an ""HBO First Look,"" as well as other tidbits and a few deleted scenes.",1154390400,4,3228,5.09640831758034

1864344,5,B00008W64E,"In a film world were there seems to be a great deal of lacking high sea/historical maritime adventure, ""Master and Commander"" is highly welcomed.  I was lucky enough to sail on the schooner Appledore IV during the tall ships festival 2003.  During this experience I developed a huge passion for maritime history.  My dream is to someday sail aboard a 19th or 18th century man o war.  Who knows maybe one day?  Later that year ""Master and Commander was released in the theater and I was burning with anticipation.  I was not let down at all.  This movie had it all, action, drama, intrigue, pain, fear, excitement, and true friendship.  All these aspects would have been found on an English Man O War during the Napoleonic Wars.

The film was purely fiction, based on Patrick O Brian's books, but as far as presenting what life was like on a warship for the English crown during 1805 it was dead on.  The uniforms, the language, and sailing techniques were nearly perfect.  Although the film is a fictional story it is presented historically enough that it could have easily happen.  Granted Hollywood added a little flare, but that's to be expected.

I was getting a little tired of the classic pirate movie and was wanting more from Hollywood in the maritime department.  Do not get me wrong I think the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a fantastic time.  Moreover, I do have ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" to thank for bringing back maritime adventure.  If it weren't for that particular film ""Master and Commander"" would not have had nearly the draw it did.  But with that being said, I was very enthused to see a nautical film with a lot more history than fantasy.

With all that has to be said about Russell Crowe, one cannot deny that he is an amazing actor.  He really envelops himself in every character he plays.  He actually made himself learn how to play the fiddle so it would be more authentic during the scenes he had to play.  Crowe was extremely believable as Captain Jack Aubery, although he was a bit more laid back than most British Captains of the early 19th century.  He would have been defiantly a captain I would have wanted to crew under.  I must also admit I have never read any of Patrick O Brian's books, something really need to do. So I cannot compare the two.  But for a film that represents life in the British navy during 1805 it did fantastic job.  I yearn for more films like this.  Who knows maybe one day I'll get that film about Lord Admiral Nelson I have always wanted to see.  Huzzah!",1153612800,2,2525,4.516556291390729
1864345,5,B00008W64E,"I'm completely and totally besotted with this film. Those who say this is a man's film are completely off their rocker.  At its foundation, this is a very emotional film, essentially a series of love stories. Love of the ship, love of the ocean, fellowship of men, love of danger and adventure.

At the center is the relationship between the men and the ship and sea.  The film does such an incredible job of bringing the ship to life on the ocean, of putting the men in the ship in such realistic ways that you are there with them, you feel the wood at your feet, the sea water on your face. You smell the blood and feel the bite of canon debris on your face and body.  You are aghast at the youth of some of the crew, the hardships.  The terrible choices that have to be made by the captain.  You are totally enaged by all the relationships that keep the ship afloat, that are the necessary foundation to the success of the Surprise.

The detail is simply amazing.  Besides the technical aspects which are unsurpassed, I was amazed by the little touches, such as the scene where Aubrey is celebrating the turn back up north with a pudding cake.  He gives a portion to Lord Blakeney who is about 12 years of age.  And during the scene, as they are eating and rejoicing, his youth is betrayed by the chocolate markings of pudding on his mouth, such subtle detail. Another is when the captain is teaching the young 'uns about how to navigate.  You see them holding the instrument, both hands are required to hold the instrument, and you fear Weir may have forgotten that Blakeny now only has one hand, but sure enough, of the two hands holding Blakeney's instrument, you see that the other hand belong's to the Captain.  The continuity on this film is amazing.

But the soul of the film is the relationship between the captain as played charismatically by Crowe and the doctor, embodied so compassionately by Bethany. And as if that weren't enough, the score is peerless with its combination of classical and original music.

Really, every element comes together to form an almost flawless film.  In a word,

1864347,5,B00008W64E,"I sort of slid into this movie sideways. After watching the Horatio Hornblower series, the Napoleonic age of sail suddenly became my top priority so I rented this, and loved it. As excellent as the Hornblower films are, Master & Commander is even better, more mature or something, more realistic. It has become my favorite movie of all time. Russell Crowe was perfect as Jack Aubrey. If you have read the books (and I have read them all) you will be pleased with the casting. For the purists, the movie takes practically nothing from the actual Patrick O'Brian books, but developed a good story nonetheless. It is too bad, because with 20+ books, they could have made an entire series - or at least a couple more. But, that aside, it is a stunning piece of work. The scene of the ship going around Cape Horn is enough to make one never want to set foot on a boat again, so realistic, magnificent.",1150070400,8,896,4.5030674846625764
1864348,4,B00008W64E,"There is an oft-quoted line from the movie: ""This ship be home... this ship is England.""  The Royal Navy had such a tradition by 1805 (the year of this film) that its ships really were little floating islands of England.  This is both good and bad - it made them formidible opponents, was morale-boosting for the crew, etc.  Of course, it also embodied the imperialistic chauvenism of the English, as well as their stratified society.  These thoughts went through my head after watching ""Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World"" because the film so convincingly models the attitudes and feel of a 19th-century man-of-war.

I have not read the source material - the Maturin-Aubrey series by Patrick O'Brien - so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film to the books.  However, as director Peter Weir points out, the plots aren't nearly so important as the relationships between the boat and its crew, between the crew-members themselves, and the books' historical authority on the Age of Sail.  Thus, this doubly-named film (""Master and Commander"" and ""The Far Side of the World"" are, in fact, two different stories) concentrates on the accuracy of costumes, rigging, and speech.  This accuracy is essential, as immerses the viewer into the film, so when the action does take place, it is all the more poignant.  The basic plot - Capt. Aubrey hunting a larger and better armed French ship around the Cape - allows for some spectacular footage.  There are the obligatory sea battles and a visit to the Gallopagoes (filmed on location in the very islands), but the best part of the film is probably the storm as the ship rounds the Cape of Good Hope.  Combining location footage, computer animation, and model work (both full and 1/6 scale), the storm is hang-on-to-your armrests convincing.  This brings up the point of the effects; they are so seamless that they are unnoticeable, and this is possibly the film with the best-ever visual effects.

So why only 4/5 stars?  Viewing this film on my system, it does move a little slow.  It works better in a movie theatre, I think, but since this is a review of the DVD, I have to deduct a star for the DVD-watching experience.  The extras on this two-disc set are interesting, but not complete.  There is ample footage of the film being made - including a 20-minute feature on the fantastic score and some deleted scenes - but there are no background featurettes on historical context, little on the anatomy/vocabulary of a square-rigged frigate, etc.  I think most people who would buy this DVD set would also be interested in this information, and not so much in information that is so similar to the extras on the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings special-edition DVD's.",1148342400,,2727,4.778251599147121
1864349,2,B00008W64E,"This movie got out of the gate rather quickly which I was very happy about.  It's important for a film to grab the viewer or at least set a few things up to spark interest.  The first 20 minutes did just that.  BUT....

... the next 1 hour plus just dragged and dragged with nothing happening of any importance and this is where the movie spun its wheels really badly.  It wasn't sure what to do with itself and just plodded along with some meaningless side-stories and situations.  I started yawning at one point just hoping that the early excitement came out again.  It barely did.  One interesting but too short battle sequence late and then it just fizzled off and was over.

Russell Crow's character was pretty cool but I wasn't rooting for the guy or anything.  Most of the other shipmen were throw aways.... noone stood out or made anything of themselves.  Too bad.

The battle scenes and camera work were solid and the sound of the cannons was awesome.  But, there was not enough action and too much dilly-dallyin' around.  Ultimately, this movie is boring and will help you sleep if you're having trouble.  The good reviews here at Amazon must be coming from large boat owners/hobbyists or ex-navy members because the general public will be squirming in their seat waiting for it to be over.

The movie is 2 hours and 18 minutes long and about a half hour of it actually has anything happening.  The rest is blah.

1864350,4,B00008W64E,"This is a historical costume actioner, and it succeeds very well in filling the screen with spectacle and excitement.  The aerial shots of the sailing ships are thrilling, and the onboard sets are just perfect.

As in any historical drama, the audience wants to see contemporary people in period garb, not authentically period people.  So, we have a scene where the lashing of a seaman causes anguish among the commanders, although back then it was accepted as necessary to discipline.

There's also a neat set of scenes in which the ship surgeon gets to play naturalist in the Galapagos Islands--a proto-Darwin.

The only disappointment is in the final battle scene.  The filmmakers opted to switch from spectacle to POV shots.  So, instead of lavishly choreographed swordplay, we get jerky, close-up jumpcuts, looking as if they were edited with a blender.

The full-screen edition of this DVD has no extras, so beware.  The film itself is worth the price, though.",1146096000,5,966,5.0251572327044025
1864351,5,B00008W64E,"The movie debut of Patrick O'Brian's amazing series of Naval Fiction was an event I regarded with a mixture of anticipation and dread.  Anticipation because the enjoyment that resulted in reading his books could be relived in a new medium on the big screen, and dread because I feared that Hollywood would do to the books what it seems to do best: butcher them.  I am pleased to say that Peter Weir's rendition of the Aubrey/Maturin novels does the books justice.  This movie is very enjoyable, to both those who have read the books, and those who have not.

Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are reunited (the pair did an excellent job in ""A Beautiful Mind""), and continue to perform very well together.  I can say that when I began rereading the series here in Baghdad to pass the time, I now see both of them in my mind's eye as I read, and it has enhanced the experience, not distracted me.  The other cast and crew do noteworthy jobs as well.

The ship used to represent the HMS Surprise was the recreated HMS Rose, a tall ship that currently sails the seas today- I believe you can visit the website somewhere on the internet.  I believe the ship deserves almost as much note as the actors, because without her the movie would have been far lacking.  I've been fortunate enough to sail in her once myself, and Weir uses the Rose to good effect in this film: the sailing scenes and battle scenes are the best I've ever watched, by far.

The story presented here is composed of a composite of conversations, and events, pulled from throughout the book series, and I believe that this was a good decision.  We can hardly expect Crowe, Bettany, and Weir to produce a 20 movie run.  However, they can take the best elements of the series and (hopefully) make a memorable movie series that is loosely based on the novels.

In this film, Aubrey and Maturin are given the mission of `taking, sinking or burning' a French frigate, the Acheron, sent to prey on the British shipping in the Pacific.  The movie takes them from the waters of the south Atlantic to the Pacific and a long naval battle that pushes their ship and the men to the limits.  The Acheron has a seemingly uncanny appreciation for what Aubrey will do, giving way to a desperate conclusion that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

This special edition DVD release contains some great special features, including the usual `making of' documentaries, cut scenes, and interviews.  It is worth the extra few dollars if you already enjoyed the movie or expect that you will.",1145664000,6,2536,4.562913907284768

Our vessel, the 28-gun HMS Surprise, gives chase despite being out-gunned, out-manned, and more lightly hulled. Even with it's clear advantages, the French frigate avoids battle whenever circumstances favor the British, instead catching the HMS Surprise off guard several times in situations even more favorable to the French. The British are able to repeatedly escape, but a final, climactic, battle is inevitable. Mixed into all this is a view of earlier military life at sea, a story of friendship and loyalty, a little humor, good music, and plenty of magnificent scenery (including the Galapagos Islands).

This is one of the best movies of it's type (sailing ships at sea). While not a good movie for young children due to the violence and bloodshed typical of war during this period, older teenagers and adults will more likely understand the context of this.

Watch it repeatedly and  the chances are good you will get some meaningful new impression. Director Peter weir has seamlessly put together many sub plots against the background of the Napoleonic Wars at sea, and a deadly competition between a French and an English warship. Viewers learn of tense and tender relationships between officers, officers and enlisted men, and between the English Captain ( Russell Crowe ) and a civian naturalist ( Paul Bettany ). None of these fascinating stories overwhelm the principle story: wartime competition. The cast is truly fine, the settings are fascinating, battle scenes are not numerous, but are convincingly and ( sometimes ) wincingly staged and photographed. In my view, this film surpasses ""Gladiator"" for story and photography. The film's gifted story telling easily wins the audience, more than would gratuitous violence.

1864358,5,B00008W64E,"Based on the wonderful books of Patrick O'Brian 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is far and away the most authentic 'Age of Sail' film that has been made to date. The Ship used to play HMS Surprise was HMS Rose a replica 28 gun Royal Navy Frigate. The uniforms are accurate. In Battle the guns leap back & fire solid iron cannon balls (not shells) that produce the clouds of splinters that in fact caused most casualties in the days of the Wooden Walls.

The Director sets out to show us a close up of life in a crowded wooden warship in the early 19th Century & he succeeds in his aim, right from a very early shot of a mass of men sleeping in swinging hammocks.

Beautiful photography, a script including a great deal taken from Patrick O'Brian novels, several exciting battle scenes, humour, a very good sound track & some good acting add up to one of the best historical war films in years.

There is so much in the film it actually is one that repays watching several times. I throughly reccommend it.",1142035200,3,1023,4.373684210526315
1864359,5,B00008W64E,"Director Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) had against him that ""Master and Commmander: The Far Side of the World"" was released the same year that the world was still processing the unfolding marvel of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Had it been otherwise, ""Master and Commander"" would have probably caught much more of the Academy's attention as the truly great film it is. In my opinion, one of the best movies ever.

For many connaiuseurs this may be the best-looking film ever made about naval warfare. It is an adaptation of many of the adventures and characters narrated by Patrick O'Brien in his series of naval novels written in the 20th century. Naval experts agree that filmmakers carefully researched ships of this particular historic period and paid extreme attention to naval details, historic settings and naval jargon.

The story is simply captivating: it is August 1805 and the Napoleonic Wars are at its best. The HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is stationed off the east coast of Brazil with the mission of stopping the French privateer Acheron. After a first engagement which ends in a near disaster for the Surprise; the French ship escapes.  Thereafter, a chase begins, with the Surprise pursuing the Acheron south through the Atlantic Ocean, around Cape Horn, and through the Pacific to the Galapagos Islands.

Underneath the main story line, lies the close and honest friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor (marvelously portrayed by Paul Bettany). If you happen to like the movie I would also very strongly recommend to buy the film's soundtrack. It is a delightful and captivating selection of pieces handpicked to match the greatness of the story. I myself cannot help but to hear in my mind the beautiful notes of Boccherini's ""La musica notturna delle strade di Madrid"" while revisiting the beautiful sea landscapes, breathtaking scenery and spectacular photography of this excellent movie.

While it does take liberties with its source material (something others have scored the movie very lowly for) and cannot be considered historically accurate, it does achieve an excellent representation of the period (circa War of 1812).
  The sets (comprised mostly of just the ships) are extremely authentic looking, as are the costumes. In addition, the script is excellent. The acting is top-notch, with Russell Crowe doing an outstanding job (much better than I thought he was capable of) and the entire supporting cast turning in admirable performances. There is not a vast amount of action here, the film tends to focus more on the drama aspect (although there ARE battle scenes). If action movies are your favorite, this one is probably not for you.

1864363,5,B00008W64E,"Up til now my favorite video Napoleonic naval ""hero"" was Horatio Hornblower, whether the Gregory Peck movie version or the Ioan Gruffyd TV version.  Role over Mr. Hornblower!  I have not read the Jack Aubrey books on which this movie is based, but I love this movie.  It has so much to commend it.  There are amazing battle sequences, a storm scene that has me checking my living room floor for overflow water, great sadness, great excitement and a host of memorable characters.  Among this host are not only the captain and the ship's doctor, but also the very young midshipman who loses an arm early on in the film, yet surmounts his disability with great dignity and pluck, the older midshipman paralyzed by his own fears, which end up costing two lives, and the ever grumbling Killick, Aubrey's servant, whose running commentary provides some comic relief.  Add to that a great score, full of classical music, and fabulous photography and special effects (especially the effects of canon fire at night and in fog) and what's not to love!

In addition to the action scenes and blood and guts, the film explores quiet moments of ship life, from the opening scenes of the sleeping crew, through scenes of the doctor and captain playing string duets to the doctor engaged in his scientific pursuits both on the ship and on the Galapagos Islands.  There is a wealth of detail about shipboard life in the Georgian navy and of the organization of its personnel.

The interpersonal conflicts and interactions are believable and memorable.  But probably the most impressive thing about the movie is the study it presents in the choices that may confront a leader in wartime.  From the light-hearted ""lesser of two weevils"" moment we are led through several episodes that illustrate the brutal truth that lies behind the joke.  In war the leader must often choose the lesser of two evils:  to sacrifice one life to save the other 196, to punish insubordination even when you don't want to do it for the sake of ship discipline, to sacrifice one's mission in order to possibly save the life of the ship's surgeon who is also your friend.  These moments are uncomfortable and even heart breaking to watch (especially when themed with the music of Vaughan Williams ""Fantasy on a theme by Thomas Tallis"") as the viewer is torn between sympathy and revulsion.

More sober analysis suggests that the Royal Navy more closely resembled Aubrey's HMS Surprise than it resembled Chruchill's distempered reminiscence.  Someone, somewhere, recently wrote that the Empire's navy was the most democratic, meritocratic, and ennobling institution of the Empire.

Rum and the lash do appear on the Surprise, but nobility (in the democratic sense) and merit prevail.  This film has a large and noble spirit;  it's an anomaly & an anachronism in an era (ours, 200 years after Trafalgar) that weighs movies by the pounds & tons of deviancy they deliver.  Master & Commander delivers mastery, inspiration, and something almost forgotten & unexpected:  good men acting like men.",1138233600,,830,5.488188976377953
1864365,5,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" depicts the adventures of the HMS Surprise, a British frigate trolling the Atlantic during the Napoleonic Wars.  The ship's captain, ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is ordered to track down and engage the French frigate, Acheron.  One foggy night, the Surprise happens upon the Acheron, with full out battle following.  The Surprise is forced to retreat, and a genuinely exciting game of cat and mouse between the two ships ensues for the rest of the film.

Clunky title notwithstanding, ""Master and Commander"" is a truly superb action film.  I have never been a fan of movies about 19th century seafaring.  The battle scenes are too often both static and confusing.  However, Peter Weir is more than up to the task here; he's always been an outstanding director, but this film is among his best work.  The chase scenes and ensuing battles are suspenseful and fully engaging.  Weir also manages to infuse a great deal of humanity - each time a member of the Surprise is killed or even injured, it's heart-breaking.  Fortunately, he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for directing, his fourth.

The Oscar nominated script is beautiful but never cloying, with wonderful acting contributing to its success.  Crowe and Bettany (as Dr. Stephen Maturin) brilliantly portray the complex relationship between their characters - close friends who respect but also challenge each other.  The film is, of course, based on two novels from the esteemed series by Patrick O'Brian.  I have not read any of the Aubrey-Maturin books, so I cannot attest to how accurate the film is.  However, clearly a viewer need not have read the books to enjoy the film.  Incidentally, I immediately purchased the first book in the series and hope to tackle it soon.

My extreme distaste is to the fact that in the book this is based on, the British actually fight (and beat) an American ship in the war of 1812 (which the poor Brits had to fight at the same time as the Napoleonic war).  What's the matter with you Americans?  Can't you stand to see a little defeat on the big screen with some great historics to go with it?  You won the damn war in the end, anyway!  In most historical films the British are portrayed as evil and tyrannical (Braveheart, The Patriot), or else just bumbling, and ultra-posh.  What a load of Hollywood Hogwash!  It's like in ""The Last Samurai"", where you just have to have some American heroe gloating over victory.

1864367,5,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander"" is a film I never tire of watching; it is a grand and glorious sea epic, with examples of courage and bravado, and a tumultuous battle sequence, as well as a film with great depth and meaning. The details of ""this little wooden world"" that is the English ship, as it chases a French man-of-war around the coast of South America in 1805, through the stormy Cape Horn, and finally landing in the Galapagos Islands, are astounding.  One gets the feeling of what it must have been like for the seamen in such close quarters for months on end. This is one of director Peter Weir's very finest works, in a career that has been replete with great stories told brilliantly on film.

Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Jack Aubrey. His charismatic and virile presence fills the screen, and he is the perfect model of a heroic 19th century sea warrior. I always admire how Crowe subtly uses his voice to fit the part, a talent that is rare in actors these days. Equally excellent is Paul Bettany as the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Bettany will be remembered from his part in ""The Beautiful Mind,"" the film that garnered Crowe an Oscar), and the interaction between these 2 extraordinary actors make for some memorable scenes. Another notable performance comes from Max Pirkis (recently seen as Octavian in the HBO series ""Rome""), as the young Midshipman Blakeney.

The cinematography by Russell Boyd is a marvel, especially the scenes in the Galapagos Islands, with its unique landscapes and strange creatures, and the soundtrack is a delight, using many lovely classical pieces, among them Bach's Cello Suite # 1, and Corelli's Concerto Grosso # 6. I recently viewed the Full Screen Edition of this film, which focuses on the expressiveness of the acting with its larger close-ups, and found it gave an added dimension to the film; I would recommend buying the Widescreen Edition, and perhaps renting the Full Screen Edition for additional viewing.

1864369,5,B00008W64E,"It seems like it's not often, these days, that a ""war movie"" can be made without its characters devolving into introspective weepiness, riddled with self-doubt and prone to questioning the point of the conflict. Either that, or the protagonist is an abominable sort of character.

Master And Commander - The Far Side Of The World has no such problems.

Being something of an enthusiast for the whole ""Age of Sail"" genre - I grew up reading my Dad's Hornblower books - I made a point of seeing M&C in the theaters when it came out in late 2003. I was prepared to be disappointed, but I need not have worried. I was hugely impressed, and as soon as the DVD was available, I snapped up a copy. It may be that a better film about war at sea has been made, but if so, I've not seen it - and I've seen most of them.

Based on the Aubrey/Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian, and taking its name from the first and tenth books in the series, the movie is a blend of elements of the entire series, rather than just one of the novels put to film. Those familiar with the novels will recognize the general plot outline as being from ""The Far Side of the World,"" with incidents and dialogue (including a fair amount of humor) taken in pieces from the full range of books and blended into a seamless whole.

Some further observations:

* The movie is rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, related images, and brief language. The language is in fact very brief. There are plenty of ""damns"" to go around, but only one very quick interjection of anything harsher; the use is apt, given the context. If someone had stolen two years of my work and burnt my ship, I'd swear, too.

* Master and Commander won two Oscars and was nominated for eight others. [Every one of those eight was won by Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.] The award for cinematography was well-deserved - this film is simply beautiful to behold.

* This is a man's film, about manliness and duty among men at war. There are no women in the featured cast. A few women appear on screen for a few seconds early on, but they are quickly passed and the film continues.

* The role of Dr. Maturin in the film is primarily that of Aubrey's conscience; unexplained in the film is that Maturin is more than Aubrey's best friend, a physician, and a naturalist - he is also an intelligence agent. The character, being a naval neophyte, also occasionally serves a useful purpose when nautical matters need to be explained for the benefit of the viewer, who might not be likely to know what the ""weather gage"" (for example) might be.

* There is a lot of violence, of course - it's war on the high seas. Blood, a bit. Lots more gritting-of-teeth than actual gore. Mostly, it's violent action without a lot of organs and limbs flying about.

* One thing I found particularly impressive was the portrayal of the midshipmen. The film does a astoundingly good job of presenting teenage boys as something other than trash-mouth self-centered whining snivelling little brats. This film should be mandatory viewing for all teenage boys.

* Max Pirkis, as the 12 or 13 year old Midshipman Lord Blakeney, is especially noteworthy. Despite suffering a grievous injury early in the film, his character soldiers on, and in the climactic battle is simply remarkable, demonstrating leadership, initiative and resolve far above the capacity of most people many years older. That Pirkis won two acting awards for his performance is entirely appropriate. That neither of those awards was an Oscar is a shame.

* The musical score is perfect. 'Nuff said.

Master and Commander is destined in years to come to be looked back at as a classic. If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you don't own it, buy it.",1135641600,9,3734,4.555223880597015
1864370,5,B00008W64E,"And fire on the uproll is just what Director Peter Weir does in this brilliant adaptation of the wonderful Aubrey/Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brien. The movie combines elements of more than one book and spins a tale of chase and combat between sailing warships that is unmatched by any other movie. The frigate ""Surprise"" (HMS Rose) is beautifully photographed and really gives the viewer a sense of what these vessels were like. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are more than able in their respective roles and the rest of the casting is excellent. Scenes of combat and daily life on the ship are well done. Costuming and period detail is quite perfect. The scenes of the Officer's meals in the Captain's cabin are very entertaining, as are those of the seaman. Scenes of the Galapagos Islands add much to the movie and help flesh out the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin. The heavy weather scenes as the Surprise rounds the Horn are very realistic and frightening to a sailor like myself. The harsh life of the Royal Navy is well depicted. The section that dealt with the burial of the dead at sea was very moving.

I have read all of the fine books in the series and am pleased that the movie captured many elements of these wonderful historical novels.

1864371,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander, The Far Side of the World, is the story of action and adventure, tough choices to be made, and a man's quest to end the threat of the high seas by any means necessary, whatever the cost may be.

Russel Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, known to his sailors and fellow ship officers as ""Lucky"" for his relative luck in the face of battle. One example would have to be a bank of fog that his ship retreats into after being ambushed by a french ship during the time of war.

The year is 1804, and France and England are at war as Napolean is conquering Europe one country after another. Only England's fleet of warships stands in Napoleans way of ruling the seas, so the tensions and battles at sea between different ships is at an all time high. Aubrey has been given the command to sink or capture a French ship named the Acheron, before it sinks any British ships.

The whole story isn't just about playing a cat and mouse game between Aubrey and the French captain. Aubrey's crew start to wonder if the French ship is some type of phantom ship after numerous sneak attacks lead them to question if there is a curse on one of the sailors, like the famous story of Jonah. Aubrey must keep control of the ship but at the same time he still needs time to keep the men happy at the same time.

There are also several other small stories in this movie, from the ship reaching the Galapagos islands and all the men looking at the strange creatures they never saw in their lives, to a storm at sea and a man being washed overboard, some great action scenes with just mother nature pounding on the ship. There's even a scene where the crew builds a floating device that reseambles a ship at nighttime to lure the french phantom ship away after yet another sneak attack.

We don't see much of the French crew during the movie, and 95% of the story takes place on the British ship. However you do see the respect Aubrey has for the French captain, and he is determined to prove he is better of the two during their chasing games back and forth as both ships manage to get behind the other during several ambush attacks.

The acting is superb, especially by Russel Crowe and the ship's doctor. The action scenes during the cannon fights and the climactic ending battle are well worth checking out. Emotional near the ending as men die for what they fought to protect, both on the French and British side.

Some behind the scenes shots of the movie and subtitles in English and Spanish. The ending of the story itself has a twist near the end, see if you can spot it before the characters in the story unveil the truth. Highly Reccomended.",1134777600,2,2669,4.399594320486815
1864372,4,B00008W64E,"There is absolutely no way that a film can capture Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin Novels. I'm not sure any video medium could, but Peter Weir came as close as anyone could. Many of the best parts of the books are included, the visual effects and the sound design are superb. The acting is also very good. Russell Crowe, while not as tall and fat as Jack Aubrey in the books brings in a creditable performance. Paul Bettany, while not as ugly, short or irascible as Stephen Maturin in the books also does well.

The Surprises were well cast and costumed - a truly 18th century looking group that made the ship under Lucky Jack's command seem like the Surprise of the books.

The things I missed the most in this film were Maturin's ""other"" activities, and it would have been interesting to see Jack ashore in contrast to Jack at sea. Two very different people.

Again, Peter Weir did a good job of making compromises to bring the books to life and on this DVD's bonus features he explains some of the thinking behind it and addresses some of the hardcore POB fans' concerns rather well.

Perhaps a long miniseries on TV in the vein of Masterpiece Theatre might be more appropriate to bring this set of books to life. Perhaps not. In any event, if you like this movie, and have not read the books, You should consider doing so.",1133222400,3,1327,4.516666666666667

At yet another moment, it seems to be a pretentious moral investigation into the balance of military vs. scientific priorities. Unfortunately, from trying to be so many things it never succeeds in fulfilling any one of them. Nor do the characters give us particularly much to care about them. The end result is a definitely underwhelming impact leaving one wondering why this film was made in the first place.",1132531200,7,582,4.660194174757281
1864375,4,B00008W64E,"Many have critiqued this movie as overly long and boring.  I would contend that that was precisely what director Peter Weir was trying to do.  Look, this movie is about a ship of war and the men on it during the height of the Napoleonic war.  The movie is book ended by two incredibly filmed battle scenes.  In between, life on a ship in the early 19th century is examined in harsh detail.  Of course, to any reader of Patrick O'Brian's novels, the highlight of the film is the relationship between Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin.  No one could have played the temperamental Aubrey better then Crowe, and no one could have played the intellectual Maturin better then Paul Bettany.  Probably the one scene that contrasts these two characters is where the ""Surprise"" reaches the Galapagos.  Here we see Maturin stare out the port side contemplating biology and nature, while Aubrey stares out the starboard side looking for any evidence of the enemy.  Aubrey is the man of action who holds onto the notion of national pride, while Maturin, always the intellectual, is indeed a man of the future.  Although they are two different personalities, they complement each other well and their friendship forms the spine of not only the movie but also the great series of books.  After watching this movie, especially in the theater, one could almost feel that they were actually on the H.M.S. Surprise for 2 hours.  Peter Weir has always directed pieces that demonstrated the terrible stress and travails of war.  There was probably a temptation by the producers to dumb down the movie and not talk about weather gauges, mizzen-masts or broadsides.  This temptation must have been great because four separate studios financed the project.  (20th Century Fox, Miramax Films, Universal Pictures, Samuel Goldwyn Films LLC).  Much credit should be given to Weir for not dumbing down the original spirit of O'Brian's work.

It is just a masterwork from beginning to end, one of those few films where, when the final credits roll, you're sitting there with your mouth open, wanting to cry because it's finished.  (Now I cry at almost every scene, happy or sad, and even when I listen to the soundtrack.)

I've followed Peter Weir since his ""The Last Wave"" days, and I think that was my main motivation originally to see this film in the theater.  Every time I see this film I notice new things. I think the most overall enjoyable part for me is the intense character development, how you feel you really know all the men, and see them changing over time.

M&C is sublime, superb, a true piece of artistry in every sense of the word.  Now, where's the danged sequel...?

Course, even Weir's ""worst"" film (Mosquito Coast) stands head and shoulders above almost every other film in the genre. Mosquito Coast only failed to rise to his usual level of masterwork because it was saddled with an unlikeable ""hero.""

I became interested in this movie mainly from some audio forums which suggested it as a good test of one's home theater system, and not only did this film fit that bill but it was actually not at all your typical brain-dead, cliche-ridden, FX-dependent Hollywood action flick at all.  Even the ending had a slight twist to it, there were remarkably very few predictable plot turns which is quite remarkable in this genre.  A minimum of cheesiness, thank God---no artificially contrived romantic or family-oriented subplot, no moronic paens to machismo or jingoism...it's pleasantly well-balanced and self-restrained.

The time of the film is 1805, when Napoleon was seeking to conquer Europe, and England had declared war.  The film is based on the historical fiction novels of the same title by Patrick O'Brian.

Russel Crowe heads an excellent cast as Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Jack Aubrey, a hard-headed, disciplined military man bent on capturing the Archeron at all costs.  Paul Bettany plays Aubrey's opposite, a gentle, intellectual doctor who is ship surgeon and naturalist.  Maturin and Aubrey are constantly butting heads, making M & C kind of a high-seas buddy pic.

The story is tightly paced and the music score is low-key.  It is music you might expect to hear watching a chess match, rather than swelling orchestral strains one expects during these types of historical pictures.  But indeed, the deadly stalking of the two ships is very much like a chess game.

I loved this exciting, old-fashioned movie.

The film is available to watch in Spanish and French dubs and subs.

The acting, set, story, action, etc. were all really good, but it just didn't do it for me. I guess it was a lack of depth and closure.. Plus the movie seemed to drone on 3/4 way through.

I would highly recommend the ""Horatio Hornblower"" series from A&E if you like this type movie. Those series will give you more to chew on.. and are historically accurate, etc.

In conclusion, I believe my mediocre feel about the movie has more to do with underdeveloped everything. The story was kinda/sorta there. The characters, while rich were not very well developed.

1) Historical accuracy - at least to a non-historian like myself.

2) Prudent and sparing use of CGI, which when it is used (i.e. in the storm scene) is done brilliantly.  The movie never looks like a cartoon.

3) The story is believable yet engaging, well-paced and never boring.

4) Superbly done fight scenes that look real (no John Woo slo-mo bull**** and no Sam Peckinpah blood fountains)

5) The characters are like real people (they get drunk, act petty, get scared sometimes, accidentally shoot shipmates in the gut when aiming at a bird, even the captain loses his cool occasionally)

6) It's great to see a Hollywood film where tho story isn't weakened by any mushy, clicheed, romantic phony-baloney

7) World-class music played by world-class musicians

8) The acting rocks

9) The whole synthesis of high-seas adventure, extreme warfare, classical music, and ecology is very appealing: a true ""Renaissance movie""

And for those thought it lacked ""emotional clout"" (ahem), if you can watch the kid cut his best friend loose and set him adrift in the frigid Magellanic Strait in order to save the ship, set to ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis,"" and not get a little misty, you are made of harder stuff than I.

I strongly recommend anyone interested in this movie give the series a try -- start with the first, read the second, and see if you're hooked.

The film is a solid adventure.  The strongest point is to provide an audiovisual insight into the brutal, merciless life at sea during the period.  That the characters, while compelling, are somewhat shallow is a necessary compromise imposed by the constraints of a 2-hour film in which much of the time is taken with action -- if you want an in-depth study of character, read the books.

One factor in the film is things move a bit quickly.  Character interactions get a bit lost in the action; with the action established, a second viewing allows more attention to be granted to the people.  Even given the simplified nature of the screenplay, it could easily have been given an extra hour.

There's a lot here to admire:

*  You get a really convincing portrayal of what life must have been like on one of those tall wooden ships:  the battle scenes, the becalmed sea, even the social status of the child lieutenants!  The movie also does a fantastic job of conveying how much of a true craft it must have been to sail such ships.

*  The (chamber-music based) soundtrack is superlative and entirely fitting.

*  I always wondered what it would look like to sail through the Straits of Magellan.  Well, here you go!  (How interesting that the filmmakers never actually went to sea at any point during the production!)

*  The subplot with the ship's surgeon trying to inspect the fauna of the Galapagos Islands is strangely compelling.  It was the only thing I came to care about during the latter half of the movie!

*  As if all this isn't enough for you, the ""weevil"" joke alone is worth the price of admission!

But, as I say, the movie stops short of being truly great, since, when you get right down to it, it doesn't seem to have anything to say about human experience.

Fans of Patrick O'Brian's have informed me that the movie is more or less an amalgam of several different O'Brian stories weaved together for the film.  Well, it shows.

April - 1805 Napoleon is Master of Europe.  Only the British Fleet stands before him.  OCEANS ARE NOW BATTLEFIELDS

HMS Surprise  28 Guns  197 Souls  N. Coast Brazil

Admiralty Orders:  To Capt. J Aubrey.  'Intercept French Privateer ACHERON en route to Pacific INTENT ON CARRYING THE WAR INTO THOSE WATERS...Sink, Burn, or take her a Prize.

So there you have the plot.  The HMS Surprise needs to take out the Acheron before it can disrupt British interests in the East Indies.  Only problem is the Acheron is about the best built ship of its time.  It out guns and is quicker than the British ship a lesson Capt Aubrey learns more than once.  Only through brilliant seamanship and clever tactics could he survive and make his ship a worthy match.

This movie really illustrates what naval life was like back in those times.  It was a rough life occupied by a wide range of people.  This movie did a great job in its prop work and dialogue.  The story was good and the action was realistic and appropriate.

Who will like this film:  Anyone looking for a movie that incorporates early 19th century naval warfare with a bit of action as well as historical insights of the time.  You will also require an IQ higher than room temperature and have an attention span to match.

Who will not like this film:  People that have the attention span of a 3 year old.  People that are not interested in history.  People that are all around not that bright.  I would recommend watching Speed or something of that nature for these folks.

It was full of incident, and every scene added to the movie's depth. It was interesting all the way, and there was plenty of excitement. In the end the captain was fooled by the enemy captain faking his identity, so it was decided to escort the French prize back to Valparaiso. There weren't any useless scenes to delete, and the ending was good.

Even though most of the movie involves one ship chasing another halfway around the world, the movie never felt slow.  Every scene offered something compelling whether it was the interactions between Aubrey and the doctor, the subplot of the Jonah who is bringing bad luck to Lucky Jack's ship, how the crew responds to the death of a popular seaman, or realizing just how young the midshipmen (junior offices) were when they first went to sea.  The fact that these young boys were expected to lead grown men in battle was simply amazing.

I also loved how the movie highlights just how rare this kind seafaring was and how awestruck the crew could be at sights such as the Galapagos Islands.  The West was on the cusp of great discoveries and visits like the Surprise's to the islands symbolizes the rapid gains that would soon be made.  The doctor's excitement and then let down about being allowed to explore the islands is one of the most poignant aspects of the movie.

And then of course there are the battle scenes.  Any kind of warfare is awful and early 19th century naval warfare was particularly brutal with body parts being blown off by cannon fire, wood splinters skewering men, and musket fire raking the decks.  The Surprise is lucky to have a real doctor....most ships were stuck with barely educated saw bones who could do more harm than good.  The movie doesn't shy away from the violence of the times or the certain brutal joy that the men seemed to take on in combat.  Truly a different era.

As I watch this movie now, I'm amazed at how much detail it manages to pick up from the novels.  The plot is actually a composite of various themes in the novels, but it is exceptional in depicting ship life and several of the characters, especially Aubrey and Killick.

I usually like 'bonus' material in general, but I must say, I've watched the bonus disk more since I got this than I have the movie.

As are the documentaries.  Most bonus material documentaries are just press material that missed being aired.  This material is truly substantive in terms of discussing the processes that Weir and his team went thru to get a coherent culling of Patrick O'Brian's magnum opus on screen.

It is of course these things, but the subtle human dramas and richly-drawn characters give the film as much power and energy as the raging oceans it is played out on.

Perhaps the best story in this Peter Weir masterpiece is that between the ship's doctor, played wonderfully by Paul Bettany, and the formidable but equally human Captain Aubrey, of course played by Russell Crowe, who just oozes with honor, courage and nobility in this role.

Chasing the French ""phantom ship"", the Acheron, from Brazil to the Galapagos Islands becomes a side story to the relationship between the doctor and commander, who come to realize that, as men, they are not as different as they outwardly appear. Captain Aubrey's steadfast commitment to duty, order and discipline closely mirrors the doctor's passionate hold on science, discovery and his strong sense of morality and reason. The two occasionally butt heads, but over the course of the film the lines separating the two men become almost indistinct.

His ship is searching for the French Acheron, a larger, more-heavily gunned warship.

It is a true picture of combat, whether in 1805 or in Iraq today. These kinds of scenes of daily life and terrible fighting give a reality to this film - a reality that overwhelms you with its attention to detail.

The French ship is larger, faster, and has more guns. Her captain manages to sneak up on the British ship twice and Crowe and his crew are lucky to survive to get a third chance at them.

The movie is a little too long and there are a couple of times when it gets off track onto things that don't really advance the story. But it does a great job of showing what is was like to serve in the navy in the early nineteenth century. The battle scenes are amazing.

Yes, Crowe is astonishing as usual and he has every bit of what it takes to COMMAND a role, and that he does here.  It wasn't until seeing it for the second time that I started to appreciate it more, you know, for what it was.  What it is is a great naval movie, not more or less about the battles and the death but about the life people led living on the ships, never seeing home.  The small sub plots which at first I felt took away from what I was waiting for actually served their purpose after watching it again.  The film is beautifully shot, and the authenticity of the set and sounds make you feel as though you are bellow deck with the crew.

1864405,5,B00008W64E,"The two words that title this movie can also outline the greatness of this film, but it would take a long review to express the complete excellence of it. I first saw this movie in a small theater, and was thoroughly captivated by it.

The movie starts out with the 28-gun HMS Surprise, Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (a spectacular Russell Crowe) commanding, sailing somewhere off the coast of northern Brazil. Jack has orders to intercept the French privateer Acheron and ""Sink, Burn, or take her a Prize,"" as the French ship is trying to take the Napoleonic wars into Pacific waters.

Close to the beginning of the film, the Acheron comes into view in heavy fog. It rakes the Surprise with heavy cannonfire numerous times, giving ship surgeon and captain's friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (an excellent Paul Bettany) numerous casualties to operate on. Jack returns fire but cannot even penetrate the ship's hull at 200 yards with the Surprise's smaller guns.

After escaping from the enemy by using the dense fog to their advantage, the Surprise is later found again by the French and pursued at length by the Acheron. ""Lucky"" Jack can think of no way to beat the 44-gun ship in open water until an up-close look at an intricate piece of nature, provided by his friend the doctor, gives him a brilliant idea.

With his ship well-disguised, Jack springs his trap in extremely close quarters with the Acheron. He unleashes a broadside and sweeping musket fire on the French privateer before leading his men over the side to board it. The battle that follows is full of suspense, great swordfighting, very well-done and realistic musketry, and other perfectly historically accurate items.

The entire movie is very historically accurate, and the immense attention to every little intricate piece of life (and death) aboard a British ship is accurate to the extreme. The period weaponry is fantastic, and the battles are very realistic and well-done. The scenes of the ships sailing in calm, storm, and battle are absolutely convincing, showing what a great job the crew did in utilizing a 20th century replica of a real British ship (the HMS Rose) along with exact replica sets, miniatures, and computer designs.

All of the roles (and the entire ship's crew) were cast with the utmost care, with not one bit of bad acting done. Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, and each and every one of the others did an excellent job in his place in the ranks of the Surprise's men. I can think of no one better for the role of captain than Crowe, who did a job that in my opinion should have won him an Oscar for best leading actor.

The soundtrack of the film is another distinguishing facet of this movie, making excellent use of percussion and stringed instruments for superb music in any of the film's diverse environments and situations.

The documentaries included in the special features of this Collector's Edition are very interesting and informative, showing how the entire cast and crew pulled off such a great film that has already become a classic.

All around, this movie is an excellent piece of film-making and not the least bit boring as some say. The intense battles, realistic sailing scenes, perfect historical accuracy, great characters, captivating story, and more make this the must-have film that is sure to become the master and commander of your DVD collection.",1118016000,5,3376,4.87783595113438
1864406,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is definately deserving of its Oscar nominations.  The story, excellent special effects, moving score, and stunning acting is what makes this movie great.

  The Story: The HMS SURPRISE, a Brig `O War, has been sent to the region around South America.  Their mission is to destroy the French ship named: The ACHERON, which is, intent on taking the war to those regions.  The story fleshes out as Capt. Jack Abrey must use every trick up his sleeve to win against the bigger, better Acheron.  The story is very good and the writers should be applauded.

  The Special Effects:  The opening scene of the Surprise and Acheron dueling it out is a testament of how great spcial effects can look.  Splinters of wood fly everywhere, and the cannons look realistic.  The scenes of the Surprize sailing are very amazing.  The ship is very detailed and looks like a real ship was used.

  The Score:  The violen music by Yo Yo MA is definately something that added to this movie.  He plays the violen better than anyone I have ever heard.  The music that is done by the orchestra is similarily excellent.  Music ranges from fast-paced battle music, to sad, quiet music.  I highly suggest buying the score along with the movie.

  The Acting:  As always, Russell Crowe, (Jack Aubrey) delivers a stunning performance as a Captain of an English Warship. Paul Bettany, (Stephen Maturin)likewise performs his roll very well as a doctor.  The other actors in this movie do a great job at their parts.

  Verdict:  Buy this movie along with the soundtrack.  It is not the least bit boring and should be added to your DVD collection.",1117843200,,1636,4.732142857142857
1864407,4,B00008W64E,"Though I didn't get all wrapped up in the story, I rented this DVD just because I like old sailing ships and all things nautical. I surfed the Web during battle scenes to get past the testosterone. (Why do men yell so much when they fight? Don't they get sore throats?)

But the cinematography is terrific, and the Galapagos scenes were a special treat. I may decide to view this again on ""mute"". Oh, but the musical score is enjoyable too, especially the string duos between Captain Aubrey and the doctor/naturalist.

I've long had intentions of reading Patrick O'Brian's books, but as I haven't done so yet, I'm unable to say if ""Master and Commander"" measures up. Nevertheless, it appears to be well-cast and well-acted. So if you like adventures at sea, you'll likely enjoy this movie; if you prefer a romantic comedy, then skip it.",1115164800,,836,4.719178082191781
1864408,4,B00008W64E,"I was worried this would just be Gladiator on the High Seas..but I was very pleased with the results.  This film is wonderful.  It's period and naval history is unequaled.  I've never seen a movie that shows so much of 19th century naval tradition and warfare.  If you are a military history buff, you will really appreciate the level of detail in this movie.  Especially if you opt for this special edition with loads of extra stuff.

If you are less on history and more on action, this movie also has plenty to offer.  You will be dazzled as Captain Aubrey and his crew aboard the HMS Surprise stick it to the Frenchies!  The violence is gritty and shocking, but relevant to the style of warfare and reality of the time.

However don't be fooled by the violence and militaristic machismo in this movie.  This movie is as smart and sophisticated as they come.  The character development between the Captain and his Doctor best-friend is as compelling as the action in the film.  And the sophistication really kicks in when there is a scene where they play a violin-cello duet (some felt this was too slow of a scene but I felt it was a great relaxiing break from all the tension).  And the story takes a much more scientific turn when the ship visits the Galapagos.  There is a recurring theme of adaptation and evolution throughout the film.

Simply put, this is the SMARTEST guy flik I've ever seen.  Its rewarding on both an action and intellectual level.  However, it is still a very masculine dominated story.  My fiance was bored to tears watching it.  There is maybe 15 seconds of a female in the entire film, and after that its all testosterone from there.  (The trailers were misleading, they showed the face of that 15 second woman to trick you into thinking there is romance in the story, when there really isnt.)

The acting by Crowe and Bettany was great.  All other production values of the film are top notch.",1114041600,6,1925,4.567251461988304
1864409,5,B00008W64E,"The premise: The British vessel ""Surprise"" chases the French vessel ""Acheron"" during the Napoleonic wars, with orders to destroy or capture the enemy ship. Problem is, the ""Surprise"" as a ship is outclassed in every way. The ""Acheron"" is faster and sturdier, with more cannons and crew. The ""Surprise"" is able to win the day through superior tactics and cunning strategies, thanks to Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe).

PROs:
+ Acting, scripting, and cinematography are all wonderful
+ Capt. Aubrey successfully deals with not only his enemy, but with dissent among his crew and critical ethical dilemmas
+ Case study in how fine leadership wins out against impossible odds

CONs:
- If you don't like war movies, you probably won't like this movie.

Bottom line: At least rent this movie, and buying it would not be a waste of $20.",1113868800,2,832,4.928571428571429
1864410,5,B00008W64E,"My husband and I adored this movie so much, we immediately went out and bought the widescreen copy. It's is going to be a classic. The acting by all was superb, Crowe is outstanding in this, and Bettany as per usual plays a superb supporting character, that of the ship's medical officer, the outspoken friend of the captain, and a scientifically curious man along the lines of Darwin (who never gets the chance to explore as much as he likes). Normally, this would be a man's movie, just as there are so-called chick films, but I enjoyed this movie just as much as my husband did...and there isn't a single 'chick' in the film.

Outstanding acting and directing. Should have won more awards than it did, but it was competing with Lord of the Rings and other great films. Funny though, Lord of the Rings will be a classic and so will this one, while the other winners from that year will be forgotten!

1864411,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is a terrific movie. Russell Crowe is perfectly cast as Cpt. Jack Aubrey, commander of the frigate H.M.S. Surprise during the Napoleonic Wars. His foil, Dr. Stephen Maturin, is played by the equally capable Paul Bettany. Both actors do a masterful job of portraying the deep, complex friendship that exists between the dyed-in-the-wool sailor Aubrey and the anarchist/Darwin wannabe Dr. Maturin. Bettany in particular does a wonderful job at exhibiting the naturalist Maturin's arrogance and intellectual snobbery that is the hallmark of so many of his 21st century descendents.

The best moments of the film are when Aubrey, more in touch with what is beyond our senses, makes Maturin eat a little humble pie.

In addition, the entire film just exudes ""the sea"". From the spectacularly staged battles to the depiction of life on board a 19th century sailing ship to the soundtrack I could practically smell the sea air coming out of my DVD player.

It is a crying shame that this film did not do better at the box office. It is an even greater shame that it was not recognized in a more formal manner by the powers that be in the movie industry. I suppose its positive depiction of piety and Christian faith on the part of Aubrey and his crew did nothing to further its cause in a Hollywood overrun by secular humanist/atheists.

I hope that Russell Crowe makes a career out of this franchise role the way Harrison Ford did with Indiana Jones.

To sum up this is a film well worth your time and money.",1113004800,2,1523,4.7320754716981135
1864412,4,B00008W64E,"I watched this movie not expecting much at all.  I though it would be like some over-produced and more bombastic ""Horatio Hornblower"" episode, but to my delight I was pleasantly surprised by a cinematic marvel of a film that uses a great cast, superb visuals and soundtrack with a decent story to provide something for everyone.  That being said I felt the movie was missing the proper exposition needed for a period piece: we find out only too late the record of Jack Aubrey, his relationship and his foibles.  This however, only provides a reason to watch the film again, or again and again.  The film focuses on Captain Aubrey's ship ""HMS Surprise"" voyage around Cape Horn in pursuit of the French ship ""Acheron"" (named for a river in hell, which I don't think is all that realistic but it sure is fun).  But beyond just this chase the film weaves a yarn about the intricate and close knit life on a British ship of the line during the Napoleonic Wars.

The film is overwhelmingly realistic as it shows the microcosm of an early 19th century ship at sea with gritty honesty.  Literally seeing the blood sweat and tears of the sailors and the pomp and circumstance of the officers it is easy to see why tension was always high and justice was brutal on the high seas.  Paul Bettany, plays his role well as the ships surgeon who has a penchant for natural science.  The part where he is shot by one of the sailors is somewhat farfetched but it makes the scenes one the Galapagos Islands all the better.  One touching scene is when the young cadet who has had his arm amputated after a battle is given A book about Lord Nelson (who also had an amputated arm). The fighting is magnificently done and the storm scenes are almost too realistic.  This is one of those films you could enjoy even with the sound off.

In the end ""Master and Commander"" is a really fun movie: it is not a life changing experience but is enjoyable and worthy of several watches.  Russel Crowe, as he often does, earns his money with his great performance.  The other actors too perform well and this movie has good attention to detail.  I recommend this movie as a great family film for older children as well as anyone with a thirst for adventure.  This is an exciting film that will certainly entertain and leave you looking for more.

1864413,5,B00008W64E,"This magnificent, swashbuckling epic takes place during the Napoleonic Wars, aboard the British frigate, HMS Surprise.  Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has orders to destroy, or take as prize, the French warship Acheron, off the coast of Brazil.  Most of the film concerns the day to day life aboard ship and we get to know the men very well.  The Captain is a warm, intelligent man who enjoys puns and playing the violin as much as he loves the sea.  There is the ship's doctor (Paul Bettany) who is the Captain's friend and confidant and  Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), one of many young boys who are learning about the sea and will one day be captains of their own ships.  The crew engage the Acheron in battle, and  the Captain asks the men to defeat the enemy for England, for home, and for the prize.

This is Russell Crowe's best role to date, and he rates a 10 on the Macho-Meter.  He is gallant, brave, handsome, and kind in a very appealing performance.  The story is told at a leisurely pace, allowing us to feel the rolling of the ship, the camaraderie of the men, the adventure of it all.  The battle scenes are exciting, but not gory.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who want heroic, sensitive characters that you care about, a literate script, and masterful direction.

Any simillarity to REAL history and what life was like on these war ships is purely coincidental. The images of life, aboard as a sailor or an officer are way way off.

1864417,5,B00008W64E,"I write this as a devoted fan of both the O'Brian novels and of great filmmaking.

Master and Commander is an extraordinary piece of work - a tribute to the vision of the director, the skill of the actors, and the brilliance of the screenwriters.

Nothing is perfect here.  There are some annoying technical errors - the Surprise sailing quickly with her sails essentially backed, for example (non-sailors won't see it, but it will rankle those who know sail).  Paul Bettany, who gives a marvelous performance as Steven Maturin, is just too damned pretty to play O'Brian's prickly surgeon/spy.  It's a concession to Hollywood, I suppose.

This may prove to be the finest performance of Russell Crowe's career.  Crowe has always impressed me with the upper end of his range, but he's never impressed me with the incredible subtlety he displays here; the level of detail in his work here is mindblowing.  He IS Jack Aubrey, who may be one of the most intriguing characters in modern literature.  Aubrey's compassion, hubris, arrogance, passion and sensitivity are positively nailed in Master and Commmander.

Now, a word on the writing.  O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin tales are too complex to be rendered on film - think Lord of the Rings, five times over.  So instead, Peter Weir chose to crystallize the  essence of the O'Brian books into one movie.  He and co-writer John Collee succeded beyond hope.  The movie takes its primary guidance from two of O'Brian's books but grabs snippets from all of them - and comes up with gold.  There are visual throwaways throughout - this is as reverential and, in its way, faithful a screenplay as I can think of, and it manages to be so despite the fact that the source material is a challenging and daunting read.

This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  Small-minded O'Brian fans may feel cheated by some of the shorthand; there are some technical and continuity errors; people who believe that movies should contain romance will feel cheated; those who look for continuous slam-bang action will get bored and if one really wanted to parse one could probably find lots of other things wrong with it - considering what passes for great movies nowadays (I confess I read a number of the one-star reviews here and just shook my head - this ain't Star Wars, folks - there's a real story here).

So be it.  Look for a thumping wonderful yarn, real emotion, an impressive presentation on the hardships of life at sea in the 19th century, great writing and above all, incredible performances from everyone in the cast.

It is much easier to sail in today's naval vessels compared to what is depicted in this film. And the film offers a gritty, harsh, realistic view of what it was like to sail for months on board an early 19th warship.

I'd rank this film up there with the Hornblower series. Capt. Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) shows his stuff as quite the renaissance man -- playing a string duet with his friend, the doctor, supervising the lashing of a wayward sailor, girding his men for the tough battle to come with a formidable French frigate, and weeping when reading over his men who died in battle.

I held my breath so often in anticipation, shed so many tears (I *sobbed* at one point), and felt so much for these characters throughout the entirety of the film, that I might as well have been acquainted with them for years.

The acting is all around, hands-down superb, and with such a fantastic cast, it makes this triumph even more complete.

This is what adaptation is all about. Weir takes all the great elements from O'Brien's fantastic novels (no less than three, by my count) and seamlessly creates a rousing story one delights in immersing himself in.

The resulting script is even and satisfying, the effects stupendous, the music gorgeous, the costumes absolutely meticulous.

From its slow opening, the film's momentum very quickly picks up. A film ultimately about friendship and loyalty (on different levels), one should prepare for excitement, surprises (since we're aboard the HMS Surprise, this is fitting!), shocks, and thrills.

The DVD extras in this edition are great. (The extra map of S. America and behind-the-scenes booklette is very nice, too)

I only wish there were a director's commentary on the feature - it would have rounded out the extras nicely. Nonetheless, this beautiful 2-disc collector's set is well worth your money!

Master and Commander (the book) was a great story.  It had a young Aubrey, showed the thrill of his promotion to commander, and had a series of fights.  It had intrigue, romance, storms, pomp and ceremony, heroism, betrayal--the lot.

So did Far Side of the World (the book).  The latter book also had espionage, intrigue, murder--lots of things on which to base a great movie.

Sad to say, the screenwriters took the two, cherry-picked the best stuff, *and based the movie on the rest*!!  Sure, the special effects are great--but the plot is stupid, the heroics ridiculous, and all the authenticity of O'Brian ruined for a few silly stunts.

In his heroes, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and O'Brian's magnificent prose, a growing and devoted crew of readers have found themselves at sea - and content.  Given the demands of this fanatical following and the extraordinary and well known difficulties of filming any production at sea, Director Peter Weir set himself no small task in bringing O'Brian's world to the silver screen.

Remarkably, Weir succeeds in no small measure.  One can tell after only a few moments scanning the extra documentaries that come with the Collector's Edition that MASTER AND COMMANDER was a work of love for Weir, his cast and his production team, and the results are plain to see on the screen: the excruciating attention to detail, the small human touches, and the willingness above all to faithfully translate what is not only a world of manners, but a world of honor and faith that may seem quaint or even jarring now to modern audiences. In Master and Commander, one is brought closer than any movie has ever managed to a true feeling of what life on board a Napoleonic era man of war must have been like.  Everything from the 1790 Encyclopedia britannica Dr. Maturin consults to the mizzen sail rigging is the real thing.  Even the soundtrack sticks to period music (mainly, Bach and Bocherini) - and not just mere period music, but music that would have been known and loved by naval officers long at sea.

Expectations are key: MASTER AND COMMANDER is a tale cobbled together from various book of the O'Brian series, with the meat of the plot of the 11th Volume, ""The Far Side of the World,"" taken for the heart of the story and yet transformed: The year is 1805 and Captain Aubrey is given orders by the British Admiralty to take his command, HMS Surprise, to hunt down and ""sink, burn or take as prize"" the French privateer Acheron (almost twice Surprise's size) before she wreaks havoc on trade in the Pacific Ocean. The movie opens, however, with the prey ambushing the predator, with Surprise crippled by a sudden (and on the screen, spectacular) and devastating surprise attack in the fog, and Aubrey's uphill struggle to repair his vessel and catch up with his quarry amidst a dispiriting run of bad luck.  O'Brian devotees may be thrown off at first by the fact that no one novel is really adapted here and the one claimed is heavily altered (in the book, the antagonist is American, which presumably would have had less appeal at the U.S. box office), and yet if they stay with the story they will be struck by how sucessful Weir is in capturing the characters of Aubrey and Maturin and their relationship, especially the tensions that arise over ship discipline between the autocratic Aubrey and the Enlightenment philosophe Maturin: ""You have come to the wrong shop for anarchy, brother,"" retorts Aubrey in an aside straight from the book.  If O'Brian fans go in expecting to see their beloved characters faithfully captured rather than a specific book, and the same devotion to the capturing the life of the period that O'Brian cultivated, they may find themselves more than content.

For more casual viewers, correct expectations are even more in order.  The trailers and the cover may lead them to expect a ferocious sea battle from beginning to end.  MASTER AND COMMANDER, however, instead captures the true nature of nautical life in the Age of Sail: Long periods of edgy boredom punctuated by horrific violence.  There are two full scale sea battles in MASTER AND COMMANDER but they are seperated by long stretches of the human dimension of nautical life and the unending struggle for survival with the sea, and it is here that Weir, like O'Brian, succeeds most.  Paul Bettany and Russell Crowe work even better together than they did in their turn in A BEAUTIFUL MIND.  For this O'Brian reader, Bettany simply *is* Dr. Maturin.  But even the casual viewer will be able appreciate the power and believability of his performance.  And if the expectation is kept on that performance, and the human drama that develops between 197 men and boys imprisoned in wooden walls deep at sea, the viewer will find himself deeply rewarded, even if the complete lack of women or any romance ensures that this is in some ways a boy's movie and, in the end, perhaps not for everyone.

A final note on the DVD: The Collector's Edition proves to be an enormous improvement on the bare-bones standard DVD, in both its packaging and the additional features.  ""The Hundred Days"" is a fascinating look at the love anbd care that went into filming MASTER AND COMANDER.  O'Brian fans will enjoy the ""In the Wake of O'Brian"" documentary - and those who have not read the books may feel the itch to pick one up.  The production featurettes are largely standard fare but of interest to those who find this sort of thing interesting.  The deleted scenes are also a nice addition, especially the scene depicting a reading of the articles of war before flogging - a gripping reminder of the less romantic side of life at sea.",1105315200,14,5611,4.753861997940268

  I can understand some of a previous reviewer's criticisms about putting the two books together, but I think it's still a great movie. And if it encourages someone to try the books, so much the better.

  What's even more remarkable is the amount of research Patrick O'Brien put into the books. He read old memoirs, captain's journals, English naval newpapers,etc. Every battle happened, maybe not to Jack Aubrey, but to someone.

But recently I caught it during a showing on HBO, on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon and watching it was like a completely different experience for me.  It's actually far less opaque than I first thought it was -- it's a carefully measured yarn -- and I'm not sure what made me enjoy more than before, if it was the comfortable home setting or the repeat viewing or the fact that its 2.40:1 aspect ratio had been pared down to 1.33 (I'm a complete purist when it comes to watching widescreen movies in letterboxed format but... I'm afraid to say that the pan-and-scanning may have scaled the movie back to a less intimidating level for me; and I did, however, immediately buy a used copy at Ballbuster and watch the movie again in its proper aspect ratio).

Whatever the reasons, I'm now a big of the movie and although earlier I'd thought Peter Weir was just doing a quick paycheck action movie, I see now how complicated a feat the movie was in terms of condensing the material and the logistics of filming large boats with a large crew in lots of different locations.  It's amazing he was able to inject so much heart and intelligence into such a complicated project.

Prior to my second viewing, I would've been in the camp that complained about the length but now I see it's actually not that long -- two hours and change.  I think the density of plot and action make it seem longer than it actually is and for people who didn't like it the first time round, I recommend they watch it a lazy, rainy day when they don't have to be anywhere and can sit back and snack and enjoy a nice long novel of a movie.  Like other long, authoritative movies -- ""The Great Escape,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Rio Bravo"" and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" -- ""Master and Commander"" is one of those movies.",1102377600,15,2088,4.419270833333333

That kept me watching for a while longer.  But hour 10, I gave up.  I realized nothing exciting was ever going to happen; and I'd grown to loathe all of the characters.  I'd also grown a beard.

While the story is staged on a British ship, the H.M.S. Surprise, it is all about the people on board.

It's a story of friendship and about the pride that nearly destroys it.  This movie speaks to the dynamics of how people interact under various conditions ranging from life and death struggles to the benign and beautiful experience that comes as the result of inquisitive discovery.

Juxtaposed here are Captain Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) and his friend and the ship's doctor Dr. Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany).  The former is a man of war and of duty while the latter seems to be on the voyage more to be near his friend and to discover new lands and new creatures than to attend to the mission at hand: intercepting and capturing the French ship, The Acheron.

As I watched these two it seemed at times that I was watching an episode of the original television classic, Star Trek, only, instead of William Shatner and DeForest Kelly in their respective roles as Captain James T. Kirk and Leonard H. "" Bones"" McCoy, Crowe and Bettany are the ones on the screen.  I half expected Bettany's character, during one of the many heated exchanges with Crowe's, to exclaim, ""Damn it Jack! Talk to these boys!""

1864447,4,B00008W64E,"It should come as no surprise that Peter Weir's 2003 film ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" would come away from the Academy Awards with two Oscars after receiving ten Oscar nominations.  Though he did not win the Oscar for Best Director (that honor went to Peter Jackson for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King""), Peter Weir has been nominated several times in the past for Best Director for the films ""The Truman Show"" (1998), ""Dead Poet's Society"" (1989) and ""Witness"" (1986). He also directed the films ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" (1982) and ""Gallipoli"" (1981), for which he won the prestigious Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Director.

""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" was based upon the 1970 novel ""Master and Commander"", written by Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000).  The novel was the first in a series of 21 novels featuring the characters Captain Jack Aubrey (of the British Royal Navy) and his friend, the surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The final incomplete novel, which was only half-written at the time of Patrick O'Brian's death, ""The Final, Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey"", was published in 2004.  Having co-written the screenplay with John Collee, Peter Weir's film adaptation of ""Master and Commander"" begins onboard the British Naval warship christened HMS Surprise off the coast of Brazil circa 1805.  The ship's captain, Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (the superb actor Russell Crowe), is under orders to find and stop a Napoleonic French naval warship, christened the Acheron, from creating havoc in the Pacific Ocean.  Unable to see well due to foggy conditions, one of the ship's minor officers, the tragic Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby), momentarily catches a glimpse of an obscured object.  Alerting the ship, Captain Aubrey scours the horizon and sees bright flashes emanating from the fog.  Telling the crew the take cover, HMS Surprise is brutally attacked by the superior gun power of the Acheron.  Escaping into the fog, Captain Jack follows a course that takes the HMS Surprise around Cape Horn at the bottom tip of South America, then on a course that takes the beleaguered ship to the Galapagos Islands.  It is there that Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who is also a naturalist, takes a keen interest in the unusual species that inhabit the islands.  A Would-be Charles Darwin, Maturin wants to explore the islands, but Captain Aubrey's main interest is the pursuit of the Acheron.  However, an unfortunate gunfire accident encourages Captain Aubrey to return to the Galapagos Islands, which works out well for both his objectives and Maturin's naturalist hobby.

With exquisite cinematography (for which the film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography), exciting naval battles, good acting and an authentic portrayal of the early nineteenth-century, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is an excellent film that is well worth watching.  However, it does a have a few flaws, with the largest being the complete lack of character development for any of the French warship's crew.  Instead, the Acheron and its crew is depicted as being essentially a buccaneer ship of bad-guys with nothing known about them or their mission.  Other memorable characters in the film include 1st Lt. Tom Pullings (James D'Arcy), 2nd Lt. William Mowett (Edward Woodall), the very young Midshipman Blakeney (Mark Pirkis), his friend Midshipman Calamy (Max Benitz) and Coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, who played the Hobbit Pippin in all three ""Lord of the Rings"" films between 2001 and 2003).  Memorable scenes include the foggy naval battle, the trip around the Cape, the arrival at the Galapagos, the accident, the surgery, the island walk and the final climactic scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2003 ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1100995200,7,3886,5.100946372239748
1864448,5,B00008W64E,"In "".L.A. Confidential"", Russell Crowe was the cop with  the dark and tragic past who found love in an unlikely place. In his Oscar-winning turn in ""Gladiator"" he showed us that man cannot live by bread and circuses alone. In ""A Beautiful Mind"", he takes the audience on a bizarre journey between genius and madness, and now, in this seafaring epic to which Peter Weir gives a surprisingly lighthanded direction, based on the novels
by Patrick O'Brian, Crowe lends his formidable stance to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey as he leads the crew of HMS Surprise in a campaign against the French ship Acheron in 1805.
 As the story commences, we view the British ship on the glistening waters off the coast of Brazil. The pre-dawn calm is shattered by the sound of the Acheron's cannonfire.
 Soon, the audience bears witness to the poignancy of lost innocence, graphic surgeries at sea, and the general claustrophobic conditions of a battleship in the early 19th century. A viewer can almost smell the stench, taste the awful food, and feel directly in the presence of both the lesser and greater of two weevils.
 The monotony is broken up with singing by the crew members, upperclassmen as well as underlings, and occassionally the elegant sound of Aubrey's violin as it mingles with the cello played by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (a role in which Crowe is reunited with  his 'Beautiful Mind' co-star, Paul Bettany)on a duet or two. As Aubrey's friend, the more analytical
Maturin provides a stablizing influence on the Captain.
 The camaraderie among the men deepens during Aubrey's dinnertime anecdotes, and outrageously bad puns as he loosens up a little while slightly inebriated.
 But the astute captain is firm and consistant in running his ship.  The film drives home the point that the young boys who served (personified by the angelic Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney) were not coddled because of their tender ages, and were made to grow up quickly in an era that had less respect for childhood.
 Viewers follow the crew through tragedies caused by natural or man-made disasters, and they also receive psychological
profiles of men who are forced to serve in such confining conditions.
 Aubrey often faces some wrenching dilemmas, but after many years at sea, never wavers in his certainty of whatever course of action he chooses. He spends a good bit of onscreen time  bestriding the deck with eyes that narrow and a perfect Cupid's bow mouth twisting into a scowl of determination during battle. A lot of the drama that cannot be expressed in words is expressed in close-ups  of Crowe's gracefully oval-shaped visage. When speaking in a jesting or slightly jesting manner, his large, deep-set  eyes-- which can never decide between emerald and opalescence--widen, and grow round as if he were daft. But he is mostly staid and stoic although we do see his delight in his work as he climbs up to and down from the highest heights of his ship to be rewarded with a more panoramic view of the ocean with upperclassman James D'Arcy at his side.
 Occassionally the men serving under him share his delight, and are relieved from months of confinement at sea when they weigh anchor in the Galapagos Islands where Dr. Maturin does his naturalist research and the crew play cricket as a respite from their duties. There is a sense of gentleness and serenity  brought on by the  beautiful Oscar winning-cinematography of the curious seals, tortoises, and other creatures as they receive a rare visit from humans. In a few brief moments the maimed Lord Blakeley has a chance to be a child as he roams about joyously in loose clothing as an assistant to the recently injured Maturin.
 Soon enough the pursuit of the Acheron is resumed. But the trip to the Galapagos results in Aubrey's gaining insight on how to lure and overtake the enemy ship. Strangely, the film's battle scenes didn't strike me as too intense, and while this film has its inevitably  dark and brooding moments, the lighter moments compliment and compensate for them quite nicely. There is a very stirring moment when Aubrey finally  views the corpse of his mortal enemy. Perhaps he feels some satisfaction...But how young and handsome his rival looks even in death. One wonders what his story was and how hard Aubrey had to try to suppress any feeling of common humanity as he accepted the French Captain's sword in surrender.
 Suppression of any such feelings may not have been too difficult when we see the high price of victory, laid out in sewn-up hammocks on the deck of the British ship...Men and boys of all ages in whom we've invested a few hour's time...The loss of sage advice of the elderly seamen, and the permanently halted ambition of the young men are dramatically emphasized as we view them lined up, pale and still, awaiting their final journey...
 But soon life aboard HMS Surprise resumes its normalcy, and when a piece of misinformation is revealed to Aubrey the merry pursuit of duty continues and as the crew go to quarters, we are left with a stringed duet to remember them by.",1100908800,10,5074,4.82258064516129

The film depicts in fine detail the colourful costumes of the period, the claustrophobic interiors of the early 19th century warships, the cruelty of the sea service, the severe discipline imposed on the crews and the primitive medical care of the unfortunates who were wounded in battle. Females are totaly abscent from this film and although this fact makes the movie a little bit dry it adds realism to the story and respects the historical truth.

The battle scenes are excellent, especially the first engagement between Jack Aubrey's ship HMS ""Surprise"" and his worthy French opponent ""Acheron"". The historical authenticity is well preserved, the music themes are very good and the scenario takes some interesting and unexpected twists. Russell Crowe is a convincing British captain although the other characters are less well developed during the film.

It is very boring, has no plot at all, a ship following another ship, ALL of the film. With a sort of ""entertaining"" battle at the beginning and a very boring and with a ""pro-war"" message at the end, which is the worst of the film.  There is a semi-battle in the middle.  There is no development of the characters, just in a superficial way. Quite impossible to be fond of a character of the film. Except, maybe, of the doctor, and not that much neither.

I am very surprised to see how many people here have reviewed well this film.  Can`t see how.  It isn`t even entertaining.  Still more surprising is that this film was made by the director Peter Weir, who directed before the good films The Truman Show and Dead Poets Society.  Really, don't waste your money and time.

If you want to see a war film, see a film called The Boat in its english title, though it is called the submarine in german, it seems to me.  It is about submarines and ships.  Or The thin red Line.  They are very good, and haven`t the pro-war message this one has.

As for the movie -- the synopsis provides the reader with a complete overview, skipping nothing. There have been some recent war movies which depict war as it is...ugly, unmerciless,a bloody hell. Doesn't one suppose that 17th century maritime ventures were rather grim? This movie doesn't reflect that. It's a romanticized version of life at sea. Life at sea in the 17th century meant LIFE at sea, impressed sailors, brutal conditions, foul bilges and water... none of which are really brought out or depicted. The battle scenes were good, lot's of splintered wood flying about and some blood, Speilburg is more graphic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the taking off into deepwater for a while. The movie shows itself to be a pretty acurate rendition of the book. The ending was neat... leaving the viewer with a thirst for the next chapter.

1864456,5,B00008W64E,"First note that I am reviewing the 2 disc set, which has lots of added features and should definitely be purchased instead of the stripped down version. The feature with director Peter Weir is especially enjoyable. The added features make the extra cost more than worth it.

In regard to the movie: you must see this if you like period pieces, especially those which are faithful to history, and action-dramas, or naval battles. If you are looking for romance or comedy, then watch something else (although at one point Crowe's character does smile at a woman, and there is one good joke).

Unlike most period films, this one is true to the historical context. Its portrayal of the harshness of life at sea, the privation and harsh discipline, the sense of duty and manhood lost to much of our culture, are authentic. My favorite line in the movie is where Crowe/Aubrey rallies his men before the final battle, and makes a point to remind them, ""this ship is England."" Given the disturbingly large number of Americans disturbed by the relatively small number of casualties we have suffered in Iraq so far, there is much we have lost.

There is one historical error. Where Aubrey says that he fought with Lord Nelson at the Nile as a young man, he gives the impression that this was many years before. But based on the starting date given at the beginning of the movie, it was only a couple of years beforehand.

For those who have read the books, the Aubrey and Maturin characters are preserved fairly well, especially Maturin. Aubrey's is altered a bit more. Both Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany do a fastastic job with their roles overall.",1099180800,4,1640,4.70383275261324
1864457,5,B00008W64E,"First, I must say I'm a fan of O'Brian's books, which have been ported to screen by Peter Weir. As such, I was both longing and dreading this movie. So often, a good book is completely denatured by the necessary shortcomings of the movie-making art, and the brute need of explosions, fast action, predictable teenager-oriented scenarios of Hollywood productions. There was so much room for all that in the books...

  But Peter Weir made an excellent job. Of course he had to simplify  the plot (the main change is that nothing is said about Dr Mathurin's activity as a spy. Also, the enemy ship nationality was changed from US to French for the sake of Yankee's patriotic feelings) to make it fit into a 2-hour movie, but he did that cleverly and keeping the same balance that make the books so enjoyable. In the books, the focus is on the interplay between the characters, and mainly between the Captain Jack Aubrey and the Royal Navy surgeon Stephen Mathurin. They are also a realistic, accurate narrative of the life on board on Napoleonic-era ships, the political situation, etc.. The action, even the plot is secondary. Often, O'Brian puts more light on the preparations of a battle than on the battle itself. All this is true in the movie as well. The same balance, the same care to the historic details. And the soundtrack is perfectly adapted to this ambiance.

  When the film was still in the movie theatres, I saw it three times. I bought the double DVD as soon as it was available. Since then, I've invited friends to see it and it always get a good success, even with people who don't know the books, aren't interested in this period or in ships.

  On the double DVD are several scenes which had been cut from the final movie. I liked them very much as they introduce more characters, more interactions and more life-on-board scenes.

  This is really a masterpiece. This is an action movie that fulfils then need for subtleties and 2nd-degree humour of a mature audience. A capital movie, and I give Peter Weir joy of it!",1099180800,3,2037,4.64066852367688

I thought that director Peter Weir captured the claustrophobia of being aboard a warship circa 1800 and the feeling of being embattled at sea.  The construction of the ships, from every creaking plank and rusting nail, is flawless.  The sound and cinematography here is superb.  As far as the story, it's slow going at first but as the film progresses and the characters become more fleshed out it picks up momentum.  As far as the performances, what can you say about Russell Crowe, probably one of the most versatile actors working today.  He can add another memorable character in Jack Aubrey, the cocksure and determined captain of the H.M.S. Surprise.  He is equalled by Paul Bettany, the ship's surgeon and naturalist, Stephen Maturon.  These two are as much confidantes as adversaries.  Whereas Aubrey obsesses over attacking a state of the art French ship, the Acheron, Maturon lobbies Aubrey about taking a more cautious approach.  One could almost draw an obvious parallel in modern pop culture(dare I say it? Kirk and McCoy).

Well, all that doesn't amount to squat if you don't have a story or characters that are interesting.  And what about a cohesive timeline?  One day they are off the coast of brazil, then next in the cape, having the same conversation!  Who was it that died overboard when poor Crowe had to cut the mast off?

1864461,5,B00008W64E,"I'll have to admit I was awed by this film.  Director Peter Weir and the producers of this masterpiece are to be commended for their audacity in creating and releasing a film of this genre in the first place-it just doesn't fit in with the formula age we now live in (just look at some of the mindless reviews this film has received here on amazon).

The fictional, though clearly fact-based story takes a snippet of a voyage of the HMS Surprise, an English warship assigned to capture or destroy the Archeron, a French vessel of superior armament and design.  From the very beginning of the film one is assaulted with the idea of just what it was like to be a crewmember on a naval sailing vessel in 1805.  Napoleon Bonaparte was at his zenith on the European Continent; the only place he was not able to dominate was the sea.

This film has a realism matched by only the best of the modern war genre; 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan' come to mind.  Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) must make decisions that literally mean life and death to his crewmen, some of whom are mere children.  Painful consequences are written all over the actor's battleworn faces.

The incredible battle sequences and the amazing navigation of Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America) are a tour de force of cinematography, CGI effects, and the simply magnificent soundtrack.  I can honestly say the DTS format on this film is among the best sound I have heard in any DVD-it is that good.

I have watched this film three times now, and am still as impressed as the first time I saw it.  There is nothing else in the sailing-era genre of naval warfare film that compares with Master and Commander.  I thus give it an unequivocal 5 stars.",1097971200,9,1732,4.533762057877814

1864463,4,B00008W64E,"An essential movie for the collection of any fan of things nautical, Peter Weir and the cast deliver an unforgettable sea-faring saga, fraught with danger, and brim full of human interest.

The sound effects are spectacular, especially with the benefit of surround sound.  My living room reverberated to the hammering of the nine and eighteen pounders, and every creak of the masts, every flap of the sail, every sour note from Captain Aubrey's violin could be clearly heard. I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.

The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.

Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship ""Acheron"", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.

The captain of the ""Acheron"" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.

A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.

1864464,4,B00008W64E,"I am beginning to believe Russell Crowe is currently the most consistent working actor in terms of starring in quality productions. Of his last nine feature-length films, four were nominated for Best Picture, with ""Master and Commander"" a likely candidate at next year's. Of those four nominations, two - ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" - went on to win the grand statuette.

Crowe's recent work is so popular it is no wonder he has been spotted sipping booze with the likes of the Weinstein brothers. In other words, moviegoers haven't seen an act such as Crowe since prime-time Jack - as in Jack Nicholson circa 1969 through 1989.

What's more is that Hollywood's leading man is despised by the cinematic powers that be. In an industry now ankle-deep in mediocrity, banking on a successful opening weekend rather than long-term commitment, studios can afford to drop a rank egg and still pocket some sort of profit. Quantity over quality is the mindset. Even though most big-name actors occasionally subscribe to this method, Crowe outwardly stands against such deceptive ploys.

To be sure, the day I witness Crowe making a cameo in some Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock chick flick is the day Marlon Brando reveals he is in fact an otherworldly humanoid.

In director Peter Weir's latest triumph, ""Master and Commander,"" Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, an Englishman so fierce that the year's other Capt. Jack - Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow - pales in comparison. In fact, if Jack Sparrow can be considered a loose caricature of Keith Richards, then Jack Aubrey is a rigid depiction of Ted Nugent.

With 197 souls under his thumb, Lucky Jack - as he is affectionately known - is the commander of the HMS Surprise and has orders to intercept the Acheron, a revolutionary French privateer headed by a man just as intelligent and gritty as Aubrey himself.

Shot to appear phantom-like in the foggy waters off the Brazilian coastline, it is the Acheron that deals the first blow after somehow gaining insight to the Surprise's position. With a mighty barrage of firepower, the Acheron handily whips the Surprise in their first encounter, but through uncanny leadership Aubrey is able to slip away behind the blanket of fog and avert total disaster.

However, as sung through the vocals of Vera Lynn, ""We'll meet again/ Don't know where/ Don't know when.""

Weir takes the opportunity to acquaint the spectator with the crew. Each on-screen construct, no matter how miniscule the role, is true to life. This sets ""Master and Commander"" apart from the ""Pearl Harbors"" and ""Wind Talkers"" of the world. Granted, ""Master and Commander"" is an action film. However, where most contemporary films of the genre resort to such lows as gushy love triangles to complement the medley of special effects, this film relies on faultless acting, a superb script and exceptional camera work.

It's ""Moby Dick"" without the whale. And captain Ahab's drugged.

It's ""Treasure Island"" without Long John Silver.

It's horrible. There's this ship following another ship. In pauses between ""turn that way, Mr..."", there are feeble attempts of characterisation, unless they're busy painting the ship. Whatever worked in the three aforementioned movies, fails miserably. The worst thing is, it's obviously there. I can buy that a great white whale is a demon from Hell, but a demon taking a form of a technically more advanced French ship? Meh.

It's surgicaly devoid of charm, humour and anything resembling amusement. A few gross scenes that are potentially captvating, but by the time you get there, you don't care. A few scenes that should be moving fail 'cause you can't quite remember whi IS that guy who just died, really...

Actors? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Then again they have nothing to do, they can't DO any better. If they cast Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery, Brad Pitt and Alan Rickman, they'd look just as bad.

Special effects and stuff? OK, that's well done. And the claustrophobics of the ship on the huge ocean is captured marvellously. Then again, after ages of chasing around, you expect at LEAST a spectacular finale. Unfortunatly, there IS none.

1864466,4,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander"" is a film of great integrity. It follows through on its promises, commits its characters to both the heroics and the sins of their natures, has the courage of its convictions and portrays nobility of spirit without maudlin sentiment. In short, it is a wonderful balancing act. The fact that it has intelligent plotting, literate dialogue, classical themes, inspired acting and is both well paced and superbly filmed only adds to its many virtues.

Intelligent restraint is in evidence throughout this film. Peter Weir shows restraint in his decision to let the story tell itself. Both Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany show restraint in their superb understated acting. Together, they are like a thinking person's Gene Rodenberry, Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy. Think of these archetypes stripped of their overacting and most egregious tendencies and you will have some idea of the qualities conveyed by the three principals in this film.

The plot and setting have been well summarized in other reviews, but those are poor reasons to view a film such as ""Master and Commander"". It is really a film about timeless qualities now hopelessly out of fashion: things like duty, honour, loyalty, friendship, mutual reliance and the questing spirit. Cynics will hate this film for its proud and unapologetic portrayal of old fashioned values. The rest of us will not only love it, but find it inspirational.

Crowe is not only being compared to Tom Hanks , but compared to the greatest actors of our time, like Tom Cruise and Sean Penn, and now he's being placed in the category of Marlon Brando and Peter O' Toole.

Those were the days when, lacking the pacifier of TV, men learned to play instruments and thought deeply about how the world worked.

I'm a big fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series of books. And when I heard the film was out upon DVD, I had to watch it.  Visually- I thought Master and Commander was stunning. In particular Russell Crowe as ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey. The crew were well portrayed, and the ships and cinematography quite simply gorgeous. My one and only disappointment was the character of Doctor Maturin (Paul Bettany). For one thing. Where's his wig? Maturin always wore a wig. Second, the character was supposed to be Irish, and quite a bit more eccentric than he is portrayed in the film. This Maturin was quite normal, and even rather dull. Hmmm... Not how I envisioned this character. The actor couldn't even muster an accent!

At any rate, the film was an excellent but shallow taste of the Aubrey/Maturin saga. If you like what you see here. Read the books.

It is the most realistic film of life aboard an English Ship of the Line (warship) that I personnaly have ever seen.  Having served in the navy for many years as an officer on submarines, I know so well what life is like away from loved ones and so many months at sea with only the men around you and work.  We didn't have the ale or rum though, hehe.  Some of them you come to hate, others you call friends, and some you come to love as a brother, just like in the movie.  And as an officer you must always maintain discipline, as depicted in the movie, much to the dislike of even Captain Jack. I know some of you reading this may not like me saying that, but in the military, that is a matter of fact.  It always will be. Many men at that time were pressed into service and of course did not like that.  They were in general disruptive, unruely and insubordinate, so harsh things were done at times.  I don't approve of it, but that was the way it was.  And in fact, when we still had a draft in this country, situations were similar for some draftees.  Most performed their duty well and were a wonderful credit to their country, family and friends.  A few though were maybe not so much a credit, as like in the movie.  At that time though, and still today in many countries as ours, men and women will rise to the call of duty for their country and do it proudly, just like Captain Jack when he told his men to prepare for the final battle.

I am sure the conditions were as depictited as in the movie because I think the author did allot of homework, and the sets for the movie were incredible.  I am a historian of sorts concerning the middle ages, but now I get a very good view of what life is like in the early nineteenth century from this movie, at least on the high seas. I have not read the books, but I think I will now, because as always, the books are so much more captivating and fullfilling in the pictures the author is trying to convey.

It is a tried and true story, one country (in this case a ship full of British~ (HMS Surprise) and another country (Napoleon's French forces), fighting over freedom. Although it is the same story, good vs. evil, you never get tired of the good guy kicking some butt. The crew of the Surprise takes a hit in the opening rounds, but comes back with a plan and some guts. Whether or not you like nautical movies, this movie, for sheer enjoyment, is worth the money for rental. Not a lot of battle scenes (only 3) or a lot of blood, gore, and guts, but an unexpected twist at the end, make it a great movie. If you want some decompression time, see this one. It will be worth it.",1091923200,,788,4.295302013422819

There is alot of dramatic things such as when the man gets knocked overboard during the well done storm sequence, the man drowning himself with a cannonball as a weight, and the 2 main characters playin music together and fighting over right and wrong.  Overall its a good war drama, with good action, performances, drama, cinematography, and visuals.  I give it a 8 out of a 10 because it needs a battle in the middle to help quicken the pace a little to make it more watchable but everything else is good entertainment.",1091750400,2,689,4.532258064516129

The plot may not be full of excitement and action, but the film has brilliant special effects and realism that will keep the audience occupied. I disagreed with the Best Picture nomination and some of the other Oscar nods.  That is the only thing I disagree with about the movie.

The books are wonderful and deserved better translation into several movies, instead of just one. Some of the, ahem, screen writing took huge liberties with the books, completely changing the fates of characters, locations, enemies and more. When I read the books, I'd find the movie bits taken from several stories and time periods. A writer's worst nightmare. Despite that, I thought Russell Crowe a wonderful Jack Aubrey, as well as the actors playing Pulling, Killick, etc. The actors playing Maturin and Bonden were miscast. Despite the hash Weir and company made of the script, I still want to watch it over and over, and keep reading the books. If you reaaally want to find out about what happened to Hollom, read the real ""The Far Side of the World"". Murder, intrigue, and tension abound...",1091664000,5,950,4.87037037037037

The story is set amidst the open ocean, in which Aubrey is frequently attacked by the French army.  The story tends to be slow at times and the characters lack development even with the films length.  What holds the movie together is its realism and accuracy to history and the period.  Russel Crowe gives a performance worthy of Oscar nods but doesn't outshine his roles in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind.  This film is a must see of 2003 and a great film for fans of films like Treasure Island and Mutiny on the Bounty.",1091491200,,651,4.483050847457627
1864482,4,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" captures the audience into a seafaring adventure set in the Napoleanic Wars with great accuracy, and strong acting.

 Russel Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey who commands the HMS Surprise to patrol the South Atlantic in search of the Acheron, an elusive French warship that is larger, faster, and has more cannon decks. Russell Crowe's bold command is often challenged by his friend and ship's surgeon played by Paul Bettany.

 The film is mostly accurate as to details on sailing vessels of the 19th century as well as the types of tasks sailors had to undertake. The film shows that sailors were not only hoisting sails on ships but that each ship had specialists on board to tend to various matters: carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, cooks, soldiers, etc. The film also accurately captures what tactics and battle conditions would have been like during that period of time. The only inaccuracy is where one ship is in pursuit of the other and the ship in front is blowing smoke: if one pays attention, one will see the smoke blowing back against the wind and towards the ship in pursuit. This presents a physical impossibility as the smoke would have to be blowing in the same direction as the wind and not against it.

 Despite some technical inaccuracies, the film is exquisite in every way. The film is has good character development and the plot is well paced; I didn't feel the time pass. The film is rated PG-13 but the violence is not so light as to make it childish. I strongly recommend seeing this movie on the big screen.",1091404800,3,1595,4.719424460431655
1864483,5,B00008W64E,"I LOVE this movie, #1 because of Russell Crowe, #2 because of the devotion to historical accuracy and #3 because of its artistic beauty. I earlier bought one companion book which displayed some features about some of the lesser characters-- the lieutenant who is a poet; Awkward Davies and his tattoo chain; Hollum playing the guitar; Maturin's assistant pulling teeth. ALL OF THIS was deleted from the final cut of the film. However, in the deleted scenes, you get several excellent glimpses of life on the ship that were CUT. And the story would make a lot more sense with them IN. I feel Peter Weir made a big mistake in cutting the ""life at sea"" scenes. If better edited, the scenes would have only enhanced the story (the Marine who shoots Maturin is shown to be rather gun happy, but not if those scenes are cut!) (Some of th deleted scenes were long but could have been edited down to the freshest and funniest spots-- bad idea Peter!) As a Crowe fan, I am sorry he cut the scene of Russel swimming without his shirt on. (UMPFH! )Well, at least you get to see it if you buy the DVD (the water DOES look like a tank but that could have been fixed, too!). Definitely worth getting if you LOVE THIS MOVIE as I did.",1091232000,2,1218,4.393805309734513

However, it is the acting, the relationships, and the subplots that make this movie soar for me. I think Crowe does a great job. There is a good supporting caste. Crowe displays well the inner turmoil over the hard decisions he has to make that affect the life of his crew. The sea is itself a character in the movie. The images of daily life on the sea are compelling as well. The battle scenes are done well. The strategies and subterfuge the opposing captains play on each other are enjoyable. The strategies are simple ones like you would use in Stratego rather than chess, but still fun. The relationship between the doctor and the captain is interesting. The behind-the-scenes options on the DVD are interesting as well. In its genre, the movie holds up well to the classics.",1090713600,2,890,4.5

 British navy life, except only for the very ""simplistic""

 captions introducing viewers to the ""era"" and Napoleon. What else could he do, though? The film has enough twists and turns to

 hold your attention, though a ""dark tale"". I enjoyed ""Russell

 Crowe's performance as ""Captain Jack Aubrey""...he actually ""becomes"" Aubrey, and if you enjoy watching Russell's

 performances in other films, this will not disappoint you.

 The cast was ""fabulous"", I actually felt like I was on board the

 ""Surprise"". The DVD has ""great sound"" which seems to surround you as you view the film, at times I could hear the ship ""creaking"" and looked around the room, not knowing where the sound was coming from. I love films about frigates,and sailing ships. I also own a copy of ""Damn the Defiant"" which starred Sir Alec Guiness, this film is ""comparable"". My only complaint was the ""end"", but I think Weir did that purposely....

They spent more time on the Galapagos islands then anywhere else looking at animal specimens that I couldn't care less about. If I wanted that I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau. I was expecting a movie about wooden naval ships, but those were more of a background scene in this movie. The character of the captain was also as shallow and see through as plastic wrap. All the other characters around him has to tell the audience how great the captain is because the captain character sure couldn't demonstrate it on his own. The political correctness was also nauseating. Make better use of your time and money by checking out something else.",1090368000,12,818,4.767605633802817
1864488,5,B00008W64E,"This film is a wonderful story taken from the novel's by Patrick O'Brian. One can think of other well-made classic maritime films such as Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando, and my other favourite, Horatio Hornblower, starring Gregory Peck. These films will always be classics, as they have withstood the test of time, as Master and Commander will most certainly do in the future.

 This high praise comes from the obvious, as this film is almost flawless in many respects, artistically, technically and its historical realism. However this unqualified praise really comes from the fact that my expectations before finally viewing the film were actually quite low. In fact, up until a few months ago, I had totally overlooked that Peter Weir was the film's director, and this man has proven himself to be one of the current greats in Hollywood. His past triumphs, such as Witness, staring Harrison Ford, in my opinion, was one of the top ten films made in the eighties. Considering my expectations were nothing to speak of, Master and Commander turned out to be a great surprise.

 For the most part this film is a story about leadership, courage, tenacity, friendship, honour and loyalty. And this is all done in the film without having to resort to unnecessary sentimentalism or platitudes. Captain Jack Aubrey is the manifestation or epitome of all these virtues and more. What an inspiring character. Russell Crowe delivered a believable performance as ""Lucky Jack"". Crowe has a tremendous amount of presence in front of the camera, which is the exact skill or gift necessary to play this particular character. If anything, most if not all the performances in this film were first rate.

 The soundtrack, too, was appropriate for the film. As a classical music admirer and listener, for once I've been prompted to purchase the recording (which doesn't happen often) as well as the DVD to add to the library. Master and Commander is an ""all-rounder"" and will be a pleasure to watch many times over. A solid five stars.",1090281600,4,2026,4.926686217008798

2. & speaking of star trek-----
russell crow _IS_ Captain James T. Kirk.
this is the most postmodern movie i have ever seen!!
here is an actor playing a captain playing an actor playing a captain!!
i think captainhood has been forever embedded in the mind of anyone young or old & privileged enough to see the _real_  & _only_ Star Trek as meaning one thing: William Shatner. watch the timing!! watch the _gestures_!! watch the way he looks at the camera. the likeness is uncanny!!
my partner watched this movie a couple of days before i did & when i said to him, ""you know who that is--"" he said he had thought the same thing.
amazing!!
dont worry, i LOVE Captain James T. Kirk. when i was a very little kid, even younger than any of the little kids in this movie, my parents & i saw him (the actor, not the captain) screaming at his girlfriend at a folk dance festival. that image is embedded in my brain as well!!
anyway.
Captain Kirk, in order to be Captain Kirk, MUST have his Spock. & here, of course, he does. but oddly his Spock is only the entre into........
3. the Monty Python element. think John Cleese, younger (much much younger), w/ a lot of freckles & a slightly skinnier jawline. think his uppercrust gestures & the way he often looks up at you (thru the camera) w/ those eyes..... right here. Mr. Spock as a naturalist-warrior-sailor-doctor who also, on the side, runs the Ministry of Silly Walks.
but thats not all!!
you also get, in this movie that was modeled on ""Star Trek transports itself into Monty Python & the Holy Grail on the High Seas"" --the old guy. you remember the Old Guy. he is embedded in yr brain too. i know he is. & it will be very very hard for you to watch a scene wherein he appears w/o thinking of eric idle, hanging on a dungeon wall & singing. every single time.
but nobody is singing ""la marseillaise"" b/c when you finally do meet those french types, they are too busy yelling things like:
""oh you english pig-dogs!!"" --you get that too!! i almost expected a bunch of fruit & a cow to come flying over the side of the boat.
& theres more-- so much more-- it makes ones brain itch trying to remember it all.....
4. &, speaking of an itchy brain, in addition to heroic self-surgery, one also gets: trepanning. woohoo!! personally, i recommend amanda fielding's video (worth looking up) as she is doing real-life, real-time self-trepanning, but this one works as a little preview. & besides, she doesnt stick a quarter into her skull.
5. &, wait, there is so much more!! poop on the poopdeck (rewind or you will miss it. my partner, who worked on lots of boats made us rewind so i wouldnt miss it)-- & LOTS & LOTS of animals. i LOVE this movie!!
but probably not in the way that peter weir intended. which is why i gave it 4 stars. it is the most postmodern movie i have ever seen. the whole thing seems plotted, directed & acted as if it were a bunch of archetypal television programs strung together or laid on top of one another (lets not forget marlon brando (rip) in ""mutiny on the bounty,"" although that might just have been inspiration for the costumes) (& do remember ""the poseiden adventure"" & undoubtedly ""titanic"" (i haven't seen it)) w/ unbelievably fabulous images of oceans, islands, ground & ships-- just gorgeous stuff from the director of ""the last wave.""

1864490,4,B00008W64E,"Set in the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteeth century, Master and Commander is based on the Patrick O'Brian's historical novels. The essence of the story is a chase starting off the coast of Brazil and ending up off the Galapogos islands, between a French ship with its clever commander and the HMS Surprise- the ship at the center of the story.
The movie itself is richly laid out in genuine props of the era, which succeeds in giving it an air of realism. Russell Crowe does a fine job as Captain 'Lucky Jack' Aubrey, a man with a history of experience and well respected by his sometimes grumbling men. The supporting cast is excellent with a list of characters that adds to the richness of life on a seafaring ship of that era.
Crowe doesn't grandstand and take over the movie allowing the story, other characters and action to speak for themselves. A lot of credit should of course go to Peter Weir for his direction and his adaption of O'Brian's novel.
Master and Commander is very reminiscent of old Hollywood epics and a quite enjoyable movie. I honestly didn't expect much and came away very satisfied and entertained.

We are introduced to Captain Aubrey and his crew, who are chasing down a French ship and constantly being thwarted. And that's it. By about halfway through the movie, one wonders when this chase will get interesting, or if it will harken back to the good old days of pirate movies, ala Errol Flynn. It does neither. The characters are so bland that the names are even hard to recall.
The movie's one redeeming quality, and why I gave it two stars instead of one, was the historical accuracy involved. We get a glimpse into the past that is neither overblown or trite. However, even a documentary needs interesting commentary.",1089504000,5,718,4.573643410852713
1864493,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander has managed to capture the essence of the Jack Aubrey series in an unbelievably realistic and entertaining movie.
The film starts out with the HMS Surprise, a small 26 gun frigate, sailing off the cost of Brazil, searching for a French Privateer heading for the Pacific to attack English Trade. It captures in the opening moments the crowding, tension, and lifestyle of the crew. When the French Ship begins to fire at the Surprise the viewer immediately knows the movie sets a new standard for realism in a sea adventure. Cannon balls wiz into the ship, realistically scattering clouds of splinters, and doing serious damage.
The movie follows the attempts of the officers and crew to repair the ship, and strike back at it's tormentor.
Anyone brought up as I was on Horatio Hornblower is going to take great pleasure in this film. While the screenplay has basically combined two of the Jack Aubrey books, and extracted events from others, the whole makes for a smoothly running complete story (which some of the books are not!)
The cinematography and special effects are very well done, and you gain a real feeling for many of the characters. It has plenty of swashbuckling battle scenes, but also brings a very human touch to Aubrey, Maturin, and the young midshipmen that may not have been possible if they tried to accent all of the personal interactions present in the book. Given the time constraints of a film I don't see how they could have emphasized Maturins' intelligence activities and still captured the depth of his naturalist feelings.
There is a lot of violence, and graphic medical sequences in the film, so it's not for the extremely squeamish, but it all fit within the plot and the decision to be as realistic as modern cinematography could make it, so it did not seem gratuitous at all.

1864494,2,B00008W64E,"I am one of those people who prefers to read the book before I watch the film.  It allows me to create my own imagery, instead of relying completely on the producer and director of the film.

Having never read a Patrick O'Brien book, I went to the bookshop only to discover that The Far Side of the World is in the middle of a 16 book series.  Undaunted, I read the first seven books before watching the film.  I was completely captivated by the description, detail, and the relationship between Stephen Marturin and Jack Aubrey.
To my utter horror, the film was a mongrelized, cobbled, disjointed retelling of a number of O'Brien's books.  As I watched the film I remembered a 10 second blurb from the fourth book followed directly by a one minute conversation from the second.  Everything chopped up.  Everything out of order.
To make matters worse the film focuses almost entirely on grand battle scenes and chases.  It does almost nothing to help people get a feeling for the conditions and relationships on a British man-o-war.
Where is the wit found in the books?  Where are the interesting reltionships?  The person who cast Stephen Marturin clearly did not read the books.  The fact that Stephen is in the intelligence business and became a ships surgeon to get around never seems to works its way into the story line.

1864500,5,B00008W64E,"Given the number of excellent movies that have been made about sailing ships, and the breadth of coverage, at first you might wonder how yet another movie is going to add anything to the genre.  If you have seen this movie you need no answer to that question.  The story is compelling as ""Moby Dick,"" and the captain of H.M.S. Surprise is just as driven as Captain Ahab, though generally not mad as was Ahab.
The story at first appears to be a classic story of a strategic sea chase between two captains.  However, it cannot be for the pursuer and the pursued frequently change position, and the English pursuer is the weaker of the two opponents.  In order to have any chance against an enemy with longer range guns, more speed, and a nearly impenetrable hull, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) will need luck, bravery, and a superb strategy.  Fortunately all three will eventually work in his favor, at least sufficiently to make a grand finish to this movie.
Three things set this movie apart from its predecessors.
First, the detail in this movie is incredibly good.  The research into the conditions about a sailing ship of this era was apparently quite extensive as the details in the operation of the ship were numerous.  Details regarding the relationships between the officers and crew also appeared quite authentic, recalling from my dim past the book ""Two Years Before the Mast,"" While it would be easy to dismiss the attention to detail, that very detail makes much of this movie a delight to watch.
Secondly, the two captains were every bit as crafty as any two captains have ever been portrayed.  We only see the results of the French captain's efforts, but we see the result of those efforts on Captain Aubrey, and we realize that Captain Aubrey has met someone with a talent that is at least equal to his own.  We have seen similar scenarios in movies such as ""The Enemy Below"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" and yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar is sufficiently different that there may be a different outcome from the previous movie.  I can tell you that the outcome of this movie is different.
Third, the special effects benefit from the decades of development of computer generated imagery.  In the movies of days gone by the special effects would rely heavily on miniature ships floating about in a big pool.  In this movie the special effects are so good that, just as in ""Jurassic Park,"" you never know when you are looking at a ship and when you are looking at computer graphics.  While there are places where you can guess computer images were used, try not to focus on that aspect too much because it can distract you from the story.
Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Captain Aubrey, well supported by a similarly excellent cast.  ""Master and Commander"" received ten nominations for Academy Awards in 2003, and in any other year would likely have won many more awards than the two it won, but ""The Return of the King"" overshadowed this superb historical fiction.  It is gratifying to see such quality in film making.  This movie is well worth five stars and then some.",1088208000,6,3147,4.673913043478261

1864502,5,B00008W64E,"There are some reviewers here who have called ""Master And Commander-The Far Side of the World"" a boring movie.  Well, if you are looking for Hollywood formulaic fare, then maybe this would be true.

But this one is different.  I did not see it in the theatres.  I bought the extended 2-dvd set based on the reputation of the movie, and the good experience I had when I bought the extended set of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

The movie is great.  Like some reviewers previously mentioned, at first, I thought there wasn't much going on, but on second and third viewings, I started to catch more of the nuances of the film and became a fan.  Russell Crowe is the new Richard Burton.  They both have what it takes to play the part of this Captain; Crowe is excellent in the part.  I have been a ""noticer""(i.e. ""One who notices"") of Paul Bettany ever since I saw him in ""A Knights Tale"".  Other cast members are placed equally well.  When you watch this movie, the story will grow on you as you notice more and more of the details.

That said, now to the issue of the 2-DVD set.  Save your money.  Buy the cheaper single DVD.

I have not been impressed with the features on the second DVD, a lot of the commentary is self-aggrandizement on the part of the Director (Weir) and he doesn't talk about what I want to hear.  He stands in a room surrounded by wonderful antiques, and then says nothing about them. But, he gives the store where he bought them a plug!  I bet they paid him for that.  There is a model of a ship on the desk like one shown in the movie.  Is it the same one?  Who knows? He doesn't say.  There are two ships in the movie, the Surprise and the Acheron.  We are told a small snippet about the Surprise having been the Rose that was purchased for the movie, but are told nothing about the Acheron.  Was it a real ship or just computer graphics?

And, this galls me the most, they re-use footage of commentary in different parts of the features.  You see the same thing over and over.  The little bits of techno junk we're given don't, in my mind, make up for glaring omissions and mental insults.

In ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" The Ted and Terry film commentary make the extra $$ for the Extended DVD very much worth it.

Not so here.

screen. When I watched Master and Commander on DVD I knew I missed out by not seeing it in a movie theatre. If not for
Return of the King it may have walked off with most of the Oscars it was nominated for. But more than that, the acting, dialogue, characterization and action are all first-rate. Russell Crowe really is a terrific actor, bringing to life the serious Captain Jack of the high seas in 2003. The other performances are also humane and realistic, especially those of the boys in the crew of the Surprise. The cat-and-mouse plot doesn't intrude on the characterizations, but creates a tension that brings out the essential qualities of each character, allowing me to identify with what it might be like to experience what they are experiencing.

1864514,5,B00008W64E,"The trailers and TV ads for this film billed it as an action movie, a sort of Braveheart on the sea, and while the film does contain two major battles, it is a very different breed of historical epic: more introspective, more character-oriented than plot-oriented, and with an eye for historical detail to match any period documentary. I can only assume that the Patrick O'Brian novels are as elegant as Weir's script, and the performances by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany remind the viewer how different the present age is from ages past. There is no historical revisionism here, no transference of late 20th century liberal thought and practices onto historical characters who would have never held them.
Crowe's Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey is more than a fierce soldier: he is human as well. He embodies the effective leader. We see, for example, his fatherly love and respect for his junior officers alongside his fierce willingness to ""grind whatever grist the mill requires"" to fulfill his duty to king and country. But it is in the poignant moments with his friend, the ship doctor Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany) that the real man comes out. Capt. Aubrey is committed enough to make many sacrifices to fulfill his mission, but respects the counsel of his non-military minded friend as well. My favorite moments of the film are when Maturin and Aubrey put aside their jobs and enjoy a round of playing the violin and cello, respectively, in Aubrey'a quarters. There is a subtle beauty to these scenes that is likely inaccessible to moviegoers who have been weaned on knee-jerk action scenes and rushed character development.
The plot itself is simple but masterful, centering on the nautical chess match waged between two determined and cunning foes: Capt. Aubrey and the nebulous French captain of the Acheron. The numerous subplots would be effective mini-films in themselves apart from the accompanying battles with the Acheron. We see in Aubrey and Maturin two very different men: one committed to warfare, the other to science, and this conflict of interests that exists throughout the film comes to a head when Aubrey must decide whether to allow Maturin to wander the Galapagos Islands studying new species or to push the Surprise on in an ill-starred attempt to capture the mighty Acheron. There is a give and take in this conflict that is the heart of the film, and I will leave it to you to witness the beauty of it.

1864518,5,B00008W64E,"The year is 1805 and the British are in war with Napoleon, who rules over France and most of Europe.  This war is not only fought on land as what separates England and Europe is the English Channel.  There is also wealth and other items that can be retrieved from different continents around the world that could help each nation in the war.  In the middle of the war the HMS Surprise, a British frigate, whose captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been ordered to seek and destroy the French ship Acheron.  The story surrounds the quest of seeking to destroy this French vessel, which becomes a great adventure where Weir involves the audience by displaying all the different layers of  crew members on the HMS Surprise.  Nonetheless, the story focuses on two characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and the ship surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).
Jack Aubrey is a resolute, yet understanding man who has served on the HMS Surprise ever since he was a early teenager.  Through years of experience Jack has learned to rely on his resourceful mind instead of taught naval strategy, which has kept the HMS Surprise afloat for many years.  Dr. Stephen Maturin is a freethinking scientist that has an infinite curiosity to learn new information or to make new discoveries.  These two men, also friends, contrast each other as they have different notions, which conflict with their interests.  There is one scene where Dr. Maturin studies the life and the complexity of life as the audience can hear Captain Aubrey's voice echoing in the background while laughing and chatting about memories of war.  This scene manage to display an analogy as it suggests the difficulty through which life is accomplished, and simultaneously, how easy one could destroy life.  This analogy serves is great example of how these two men complement each other and create an harmonious atmosphere on board a ship in war time.
Master and Commander is an engaging film on many levels as Peter Weir presents the composition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.  These themes provide much food for thought as they open many new doors.  The complexity to Weir's seafaring tale is of great depth as it portrays both a swashbuckling adventure and a philosophical dialogue, which any audience will enjoy on either a visual or cerebral level.  Lastly, the cast performs superbly and is supported by marvelous cinematography, which is blended with masterful directing.  This leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that has several lessons, which can be both interesting and educational for many generations.",1086307200,3,2668,5.029545454545454

As a movie this is very good compared to most recent attempts to portray heroism.  Crowe is perfect as Capt. Jack.
As a fan of the Patrick O'Brian books that inspired this movie I was impressed with the overall production and script of this movie.  In fact, this movie is in many ways better than the books, which were a bit overrun with an abundance of naturalistic descriptions that often slowed down the plotline to the point of boredom.
The very act of trying to translate the books to the screen seems to have neccesitated the deletion of the naturalistic elements in favor of keeping the story moving.

Russell Crowe does a fine job of portraying the captain of a British ship in search of the French enemy. His enemy is a worthy quarry and must be tracked to the ends of the Earth. Even when you think the movie is concluded you find it is not. The acting is excellent and they did a fine job of casting.

The real treat is the photography and sets. The level of detail is phenomenal. Rarely have I seen such attention to what helps to make a great seafaring movie, a great ship set. The ambiance of sea life is so well preserved you will think you are smelling the sea breeze and feel the salty spray across your face. That or you will feel cramped and smell the sweat and powder below decks as they engage the enemy.

The DVDs included in this are first quality and the picture and sound is excellent. It includes numerous extras you can find listed under the details above. All in all this movie was masterfully done.

I initially rated this four stars. I would change that to three if I could now. The reason is the more I reflected on this movie I realized I wouldn't be likely to watch it again for some time. What I mean is it does not have a great deal of replayability. The reason is that I wasn't happy with the constant chasing of only one quarry and then even at the end the chase starts all over again. You feel you have been cheated out of a victory and that leaves a hole in the story.

Peter Weir has collected all his available resources - a good story, CGI, other special effects, skilled cinematographers and set designers and a great cast and crew to put us to sea with a mighty hearty seagoin' adventure.
Crowe's ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey is intelligent and seasoned, and clearly cares about his men individually as well as the ship and crew as a whole.  In his character we get to see the weight of momentous decisions he must make - sacrificing the life of an overboard sailor to save the entire ship, as well as bringing his overgunned and outmanned HMS Surprise right up to the speedy French Acheron and letting his crew have at it, knowing that many lives on both sides will be lost.
We get to see that the Captain is not always right, and he occasionally has to accept the consequences of his wrong actions or decisions.  But we also get to see that often effective leadership means taking decisive action and implementing an imperfect plan because a team that is committed to a wrong plan will accomplish more than a crew paralyzed because leadership has come up with no plan at all.
There is no love story artificially superimposed upon this rousing good tale, and the performances are fine and memorable.

Even Russell Crowe didn't pull in this movie for me despite being a great actor. He is convincing as Captain Aubrey but instead of acting and emoting he does more posing than anything else. Maybe it's because the movie itself had absolutely no storyline to connect the viewers to the individual characters. The sea is beautiful, the Galapagos adventure amazing, the period pieces and ship detail as accurate as I could imagine, but there just is no plot. Two boats travel about a restless ocean trying to anniliate one another over political control, so what!

This movie ought to be seen on the big screen.  Somehow, my TV set did not do justice to Weirs incredible cinematography.
Having read almost all of C.F. Foresters Hornblower series, I was wondering if Weir could capture the atmosphere of a 19th century man-of-war.  I was not disappointed.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie was Weirs meticulous attention to detail. It was simply amazing.  Weir captured the nuances of 19th century naval warfare- crowded berths, the rotten food, and constant danger due to accident or war.
We can learn much about leadership from Master and Commander.  Leaders are paid to make decisions and many of those decisions are not easy to make- does Aubery rescue the drowning sailor, or risk his crew to save him? He lets the sailor drown.  Leaders just do not make decisions, they must motivate people to follow them.  As Master and Commander, Aubery motivates his crew to do the impossible, engage and defeat a much more powerful enemy.

1864531,5,B00008W64E,"This recent movie Master and Commander is a fascinating adventure story of the H.M.S. Surprise chasing the Acheron, a much larger and faster ship. I enjoy this movie because it brings you back in time to 1805 and shows the cramped life aboard a ship as well as how gruesome a sea battle was to fight. It shows the importance of hierarchy, cooperation and obedience that was needed aboard the ship to keep it going especially during battles and storms. I also enjoy this movie because of the sometimes gruesome action and battle scenes. For example, in the first battle the as canon balls hit the ship and splinters fly, a young midshipman, named Blakeney, is hit. His arm is eventually amputated because of gangrene. Then in the last battle between the Surprise and the Acheron you have canon balls, splinters and bullets fling in every direction; swords clanging and men killed all around. But in between the battles and storms, the captain and the surgeon play the violin and the cello.  Peter Weir, the director of Master and Commander, combined and adapted books #1 and #10 of Patrick O&#146;Brian&#146;s Aubrey and Maturin 20 book series. To make the fully sea worthy H.M.S Surprise he refitted a ship called The Rose*. He picked Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany to portray the characters Aubrey and Maturin. He had the characters hardly touch land to show the hard life aboard a ship during the 1800&#146;s and the gruesome battles fought at sea. With C.G.I. he brought to life the fearsome storms and battles and with the make-up, made the gruesome wounds of sea battle look real. In all, Master and Commander is a great movie.

1864532,4,B00008W64E,"MOVIE: This film is about the story of Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew on the HMS Surprise. The film takes place during the times of the Napoleonic Wars at sea. What makes this film a winner is the fact that it was able to stay incredibly historically accurate and still maintain is entertaining value. Most movies that try to be historically accurate tend to fail miserable due to them being . . . well . . . boring! Take Gods and Generals for example. Anyway, the film documents the adventures and journeys of this ship as it fights for their country and themselves. I guess what made this movie so exciting was the incredible sound and visuals. At $150 million, the movie was no cheap fare to make. Unfortunately it did horribly at the box office and was the reason that the movie was split between three different distributors (20th Century Fox, Universal, and Miramax). What really makes this film so enjoyable is the fact that it has such a fantastic ensemble cast. As you've expected, Russell Crowe is the star of the show, but without the supporting cast his performance would have gone to waste. A terrific film, one of the best of its kind, and something that you can take with you to history class and to your home theater.
VIDEO: The video of this DVD is incredible. Your HDTV will certainly get its run for the money, mine sure did. This two disc set comes in anamorphic widescreen in a 2.40:1 ratio.
AUDIO: Here you get an amazing DTS and Dolby 5.1 mix that will knock your socks off. The sound of this movie is incredible and needs mixes like these.
PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I have the two disc edition. I personally feel that the only reason why we have the choice of one disc and two disc editions is because of the poor performance at the box office. So in order to get as much money as they could, they put two discs in a fancy shmancy box and charge a lot for it. Then they give the option of a disc with absolutely nothing on it so buyers of the two disc set feel special. Honestly the extras are nothing to bananas over. It's not a great amount and they are not all that special. In this set you get trailers and tv spots, 70 minute behind the scenes documentary, how they adapted the movie from the books, moviemaking secrets, sound design featurette, cannon demonstration, 6 deleted scenes, multi angle scenes, and a split scene vignette. When someone buys something they always want it to be the better of its kind. So knowing how the human mind works, Fox released a bare bones release and a normal two disc set wrapped all pretty and slapped a big price tag for that. Naturally the consumer will buy the better set. I don't see why the consumer has to suffer just because their marketing failed during the theatrical release. The set is good though, I'm just complaining about how they released it and priced it, that's all.

1864533,4,B00008W64E,"""Master And Commander"" is a masterpiece of a film.  It shows an accurate description of Napoleonic-era nautical warfare, as well as the bonds shared between a group of men on the sea.  Russell Crowe plays Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, leader of the HMS Surprise.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's doctor/Aubrey's confidant.  The entire cast does an outstanding job.
The story begins with an attack on the Surprise by the Acheron, a French warship that Aubrey is hunting.  The rest of the film plays out with Aubrey setting out on a quest to outwit and defeat the Acheron, a ship that is armed with more guns, more men, and a captain that even Aubrey is respectful of.  Along the way, we see Aubrey's softer side, his human side, that usually isn't portrayed in a character of his magnitude and position.  We are shown the bonds of brotherhood that keep the crew together through good times and bad.  We also see how life on a warship can swiftly change from boredom to life-and-death situations, as well as discipline carried out by ranking officials.
Overall, I've yet to see a film that reveals so much action, so many emotions, and so much reality into two-and-a-half hour production.  Highly recommended.",1085443200,2,1204,4.805825242718447

1864537,5,B00008W64E,"I'm well on halfway through the ""3 score and 10"" years that a human being is allowed; an honest to goodness boomer. Therefore, I can honestly say that I have viewed thousands of movies throughout this time. Some, flip-flopping black and white versions, tinted with the greenish cast of my family's, ""never say die"" American Made Zenith. Hundreds more on the wonderful early color sets that seemed to favor enhancing the RED spectrum over the other two. Of course, I can not forget the handful I got to watch through the steamy car windows while parked at a local Drive-In, and those I saw through the smoke filled air while seated beside my older brother and younger sister stuck to the candy covered seats of graceful old theaters.
Then, in the late '70's, I can remember talk of this WONDERFUL new invention, soon to be in every American's Living-room: The BETA VCR!
""WOW! What an amazing idea."" I thought. But then snidely snapped, ""How stupid can these guys get?! Only a moron would sit and watch the SAME movie over and over! Shish.""
Well, the 'rest of the story' is, though I NEVER did buy a BETA VCR, I do own more than one DVD player, as well as multiple 4 head VHS machines. I sure do love the taste of crow. Which is, perhaps another irony, for the taste of Russell Crowe's performance (and equally that of Paul Bettany & Max Pirkis who played Midshipmen, Lord Blakeney) in ""Master and Commander"" is a dish worth consuming many times over.
Like I said, I've watched a myriad of films. Most were 'okay'. A Bunch of them were: ""P.U."" Still, after just a few, In wonderment I'd say: ""Where the heck did my breath go?!"" The latter are the ones I yearn, and wait around for. Films that really ROCK my soul. Well written, Well adapted, Well crafted, Well acted & performed- e.g.: The Master Works of the film industry. Few films, as far as I am concerned, are worthy of this status- at least in my heart.
Now in light of all this magnificent qualification, I list my top ten films, reverse order: 10th: ""Rob Roy"" w/ Mel Gibson 9th: Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", 8th: ""Schindler's List"", 7th: Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"", 6th: ""Leon, The Professional"" w/Jean Reno-UNCUT version, 5th: ""Casablanca"" w/H. Bogart, 4th: ""A Knight's Tale"" w/Paul Bettany & Heath Ledger, 3rd: Star Wars ORIGINAL Trilogy, 2nd: ""The Lord of the Rings""- (2nd at least till the extended version of Return of the King is released), 1st: All of the ""Harry Potter"" films currently released.
But, WAIT! I don't see A SINGLE THING about ""Master and Commander""! you may be thinking. Please, calm yourselves. I shall explain all. There IS no place for Master and Commander on this list.
MASTER AND COMMANDER stands alone.
This film, without a doubt, and without the slightest hesitation on my part, is THE finest film I have EVER seen. What I thought I'd brought home was just another gory, splattery, intense action adventure flick- purchased mainly to entertain the tastes of my husband (No offense, dear). It leapt beyond my expectations in the first 15 minutes, revealing itself to be was a rich, amazing view of a long ago world. A world where little boys shouldered the weight of manhood with courage and fortitude. Where friendships held through horrendous test. Where the wit, heart, love, and passion of all characters involved were intricately, and heart wrenchingly revealed. To all players involved: I stand amazed, my head reeling.
To all those thinking of buying this version I say, ""Just Do It."" One has to see this film to fully understand it's greatness... for there are not enough adjectives in any language to full describe it. BRAVO! to ALL involved in the making of this film; and please, may we have more?",1085356800,3,3704,4.726429675425039

From realistic battles scenes to graphic operations on the wounded, this movie is a roller-coaster ride of greatness.  One could almost become seasick watching Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast in this accurate example of how battles were fought on the open sea in 1805.  This movie is one of the years best, boasting a very believable screenplay and enough beautiful shots to fill up a few National Geographic magazines; the shots of Galapagos Islands were amazing.

1864547,5,B00008W64E,"-
The film, Master and Commander, based on the novels of Patrick O'Brian, speaks to the pinnacle achievements of European culture. What a great pity that the world is now suffocated by a poisoned atmosphere of jealousy and hate directed against Caucasian Europeans, such that many proud inheritors of their singular Western Culture are afraid to speak its name, or to herald its praises directly and without apology or explanation. The creators of this film have pushed at the envelope of containment that surrounds every possible celebratory depiction applauding Europeans, or the achievements of Western Culture and Christian-based societies. However, despite the courage of the director, co-screen writer, and co-producer: Peter Weir, and despite the fact that this work is bolder and more honest than other products coming from the entertainment industry, not everything here is boldly spoken. There is a great deal to be absorbed by analyzing the symbolism and the metaphoric content of this film-a great deal of the message is delivered in metaphor, and with the music.
The overall musical presentations of this film are very impressive, and the CD of the musical score is far from a disappointment. The skillfully repetitious use of percussion instruments throughout the film successfully recreates the sound of a thumping on the ship's hull: a sound that chills the heart of every sailor and alerts him to danger. The blood, the bravery, the glories of battle, as well as the continued yearning to acquire knowledge and  explore the unknown, are punctuated by the music of Mozart, Corelli, Bach, and Boccherini, each of whom is the product of a refined, highly developed  European culture, represented here by one French and one British warship on the untamed, empty sea.
Russell Crowe, as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey of H.M.S. Surprise, and Paul Bettany, as the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin-reunited after their fine performances in A Beautiful Mind-symbolize the intricate structure, the delicate balance, the intellectual and artistic achievements, and even the fragility of European civilization, as their characters perform in the great-cabin of a 19th Century warship, some of the most beautiful and sophisticated classical music ever written. Also a product of European culture is the clever, unseen captain of the French frigate Acheron, who hounds and bedevils Aubrey-on the far side of the world- as this remarkable film reveals the story of a conflict between two European empires played out on the bloody decks of two warships, in the era of Napoleon I.
The action, for the most part, takes place aboard H.M.S. Surprise, amid a plethora of subtle contrasts skillfully woven into the structure of the story.  These contrasts define the men, their race, and their culture: science vs. superstition, boldness vs. complacency order vs. disruption, leadership vs. permissiveness, intelligent adaptation vs. extinction.
The choices made by the ships company and how they act and react, in the face of these contrasts, makes a statement about who they are and what they represent.
Captain Aubrey reminds his crew to always stand tall and uphold their beliefs and their people, for wherever their small ship sails it represents England. Again and again, the cameras show a small ship in a vast expanse of ocean, floating into an uncertain future under a darkening sky. An excellent metaphor pointing to the uncertain future of White Europeans and Western Culture, which are already under relentless attack from the socialist remnants of collapsed Communism, and from ""politically correct"" historical revisionism striving to diminish or remove any reference to heroic Caucasian males, like Captain Jack Aubrey.
The original score's musical reverberations suggest a beating against the hull, rather than the sound of cannons shooting-there is no sharp ""crack"" as might be expected with the sound of gunfire. This simplicity of deep aboriginal-like drumming is a counterpoint to the sweet complexity of the classical compositions punctuating the story, which at first appears to address only the interactions of two ships. It is only upon closer analysis that the racial and cultural aspects become apparent. The real threat to England and H.M.S. Surprise is not from France, a fellow European nation, or from France's warship Acheron; the threat is from that percussive thumping on the hulls of both ships, as if something on the outside wanted to get inside-inside the warships and inside the ships-of-state represented by Surprise and Acheron.
The several all too brief glimpses into the great-cabin of Surprise, where Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin play on violin and cello respectively-while outside the endless, untamed sea stretches to infinity-are among the most moving I have seen. The most compelling is when Surprise is sailing slowly ahead, and the camera angle is from outside the great-cabin looking in through the wide-open stern windows, as though the viewer were seeing through the eyes of a skulking enemy, or the sea itself. The ship, and the heroes, and the music are warm and candle-lit inside, but the wild sea, the unknown future, and unknown dangers are watching from close behind-a powerful suggestion of man's Darwinian struggle for survival, for procreation, for adventure, and sometimes for fun.
The classical music is used as a skillful surgeon uses a scalpel, to separate the light from the dark, to define the good and the glory, to contrast hope from hopelessness, and to inspire today's sons and daughters of men like ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey and his disciplined, faithful crew to look around them and prepare to fight off, yet again, threats to their future, their culture and their people. As the sweet music fills the cabin and drifts away, the small ship sails alone on an endless sea-above all, there is the music.
If, indeed, all art aspires to the condition of music, then the miraculous melodies in this film represents the culmination of two thousand, and more, years of unequaled European cultural achievements. Listen to it! Experience it!",1085270400,6,6093,5.247179487179487

1864549,5,B00008W64E,"One reason that going to a movie theatre hasn't been killed by video is that some movies are simply spectacular on the big screen. When I watched Master and Commander on DVD I knew I missed out by not seeing it in a movie theatre. If not for Return of the King it may have walked off with most of the Oscars it was nominated for. But more than that, the acting, dialogue, characterization and action are all first-rate. Russell Crowe really is a terrific actor, bringing to life the serious Captain Jack of the high seas in 2003. The other performances are also humane and realistic, especially those of the boys in the crew of the Surprise. The cat-and-mouse plot doesn't intrude on the characterizations, but creates a tension that brings out the essential qualities of each character, allowing me to identify with what it might be like to experience what they are experiencing. Master and Commander tells its story in an intelligent, thoughtful manner without compromising the excitement, terror and tension of naval warfare.",1085097600,,1028,4.846590909090909
1864550,4,B00008W64E,"There is no knowing what great theme Peter Weir is going to take it into his head to make a film about next. It is a long way from ""The Cars that ate Paris"" to ""Master and Commander"" - or maybe not. Like most Australians, who have to travel to the far side of the world themselves if they want to get home, Weir is probably fascinated with isolation, with the journeys undertaken into the unknown by people like Captain Cook, and with the complex little communities that existed on crowded ships where men lived and died side-by-side under a strict authoritarian hierachy. In this film, this strange hierachy is underscored by the plucky little midshipman, upperclass to his bones, bawling at seamen four times his age.
Having read some of the Jack Aubrey books, this film is a great distillation of them. The Stephen Maturin character is probably the better for being portrayed as a humanist rather than as a vaguely paranoid Irishman with a complicated background. The opening scene is one not to be missed, with the creeping tension broken by crashing salvos of cannon fire. It leaves you well pleased not to have been involved.
There is no bang crash ending to the film in contrast to what most of us may be used to; rather it proceeds as a series of vignettes, knitted together by their pursuit of a French privateer. Even when you think it is all over, it is apparent that time rolls on, ships sail on and their job is still not over. It sticks in the mind, for all that and is well worth the popcorn.",1085097600,7,1507,4.5036496350364965
1864551,5,B00008W64E,"I approached this movie assuming I would enjoy simply because Russell Crowe is the title star of the film, but the film is much better than I anticipated.  As Captain Jack Aubrey, Crowe plays the Commanding officer of the British vessel the HMS Surprise.  Severely damaged by a new and more militarily advanced French warship, Aubrey must choose whether to abandon his mission and repair his ship, or do the best he can and seek revenge.  As expected, Crowe's performance was excellent.  He plays the role of an early 19th century naval Captain extremely well.  A second standout performance was delivered by Paul Bettany who played the ship's doctor;  He was definitely the character I sympathized with the most and Bettany should be lauded for his performace.
The strength of this movie resides in it's intense realism.  From the setting, to the manner in which life onboard a 19th century vessel is portrayed, to the carnage and gruesomeness of the battles, this film did a remarkable job of recreating an authentic atmosphere to make the viewer believe he or she is actually watching 19th century naval history.  There is one scene near the beginning of the film which shows a young child having his arm amputated after an encounter with the French.  One can only imagine that what is depicted on the screen was as bad if not worse in real life.  This film is truly an enjoyable viewing experience and one any history enthusiast or fan of dramatic adventure films should see.",1085097600,3,1479,4.810276679841897
1864552,4,B00008W64E,"Director Peter Weir delved deeply into the relationship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew as they embark on a cat and mouse game to capture or destroy the highly advanced French enemy frigate, Acheron. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Capt Jack Aubrey was finely tuned to create a brilliant tactician with wit, humor and intense leadership qualities with much humanity.  He was able to laugh with his men yet instill the highest standards of discipline and expected protocol to be followed to the tee.  The ship's doctor, a naturist and healer, does not understand the military mindset and understands even less the fine line between friendship and duty.  It's through their banter we come to understand the leadership-style and character of Capt Jack Aubrey.
The great plus of this movie resides in the extensive detail that is put into recreating a late 17th century era from both a Naval and Darwinian viewpoint.  Orders, protocol, uniforms, salutes, meals, canons and even choice language is very well depicted in this movie.  The actors make it seem as if their whole lives had been on that ship.  You really felt like you were part of that crew. Equally realistic is the doctor's fascination with the creatures of the Galapagos Islands, calling the animals by their scientific name and keeping a detailed diary of drawings.
The director definitely wanted to highlight the emerging presence of modern science and how it could be challenging to centuries of tradition and values.  This is clearly paralleled in the doctor's and Capt Aubrey's distinct philosophies. But Weir is clever enough to resolve this by showing the two can co-exist and prove quite a powerful, if not necessary, combination.
If you're expecting a movie with a lot of barking orders, swashbuckling and canon-fire in scene after scene, just all out action, then you could be mistaking this for Pirates of the Carribean or even Gladiator. This is very much a serious drama with engaging action sequences built into it, not the other way around. So it can be slightly off-putting, if not a bit boring.
Nonetheless a worthwhile and insightful film.  I highly recommended.",1084924800,2,2146,5.025352112676057

Furthermore, the man who was selling the popcorn was a racist, and his relentless taunts will remain in my mind for the rest of my life.

1864554,5,B00008W64E,"20th Century Fox really went to town on this full-rigged edition of Peter Weir's ultimate old man movie ""Master and Commander: The Far side of the World.""  From stern to stern, they've packed these two discs with worthwhile features in addition to a superb transfer of the movie itself.  Two documentaries, each in anamorphic widescreen video, are particularly good:  one is a basic but very seaworthy behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film and the other is Skipper Peter Weir's perspective on how he approached the adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels.  Worth a few more crowns than the stripped-down version, eh, mate?
Why is this the ultimate old man movie?  If ya have to ask, ""Master and Commander"" may be better off settin' sail without ya!  With pitched ship-to-ship battles, death-defying swordplay, vicious squalls, and nary a female character in sight (save for the briefest of moments; better not blink), this is the perfect entertainment for the saltiest of sea dogs.

1864555,3,B00008W64E,"Master & Commander is a fun movie to watch and marvel at all the detail and special effects, but in the end it doesn't offer enough to make it a memorable movie.
While set in the French Revolution and involving an English and French ship chasing each other, the movie is not about action.  The focus of the movie is life aboard a ship and the interaction of all the people on the boat.  This is the strength of the movie.
The crew (all men) live in miserable conditions with primitive means for eating and medical care.  You'll be amazed at the misery these people endured and thought as normal.  Since the movie is about life on the about, there better be some strong characters to carry the story.
Russell Crowe does a good job as captian Jack Aubrey, although at times he seems to be just doing the normal things a captain would do (citing scriptures a crewman's funeral).  Aubrey seems to only be close to the officers and is good friends with the doctor.  To me the doctor on the ship is the best character, suffering an injury, and showing compassion for the crew and common sense when needed.
The climactic action scene is exciting yet at the same time its hard to tell who is who and the scene ends in what seems like too short of time for what was actually accomplished.
In the end, I enjoyed this movie in spite of the fact I found it hard to enjoy or empathize with any of the characters.  And thus the story of the life aboard a British navy vessel was enjoyable for the detail, but not for the characters involved.",1084752000,,1527,4.355633802816901

1864558,5,B00008W64E,"Imagine a movie that lasts more than two hours and during that time only shows the confrontation of two ships near the coast of South America. Sounds like a very boring premise, right? Wrong! Director Peter Weir has done an outstanding job in creating an exciting atmosphere and hooking the viewer throughout the duration of the film.
It is April 1805 and Napoleon has only one last barrier to cross in order to rule over Europe: the British Fleet. Lucky Jack (Russell Crowe) is the captain of the Surprise, an English ship sailing in the north coast of Brazil, when the Acheron, a French ship that outclasses them in speed and weaponry, attacks them. The Surprise, which was surprised by the Acheron, was saved by miracle of the fog, were they lost themselves preventing their doom. Now Lucky Jack has to decide whether to return home for repairs and reinforcements, or go after the aggressor and try to defeat this dangerous enemy. Obviously, Jack chooses the latter path, even against the advice of some of his nearest officers in rank.
One of the aspects that make this movie extremely interesting is that it reveals the way of living aboard a battle ship in the beginning of the nineteenth century. For example, the audience gets to see the relationship forged between these men and the rules of honor that determine their conduct. Among these rules, we can observe that the value of friendship is paramount.
This production of epic magnitude delivers what it promises: action, glorious settings, impeccable performances and a nail biting chase between to ships that become archrivals. In some aspects, the relationship between Lucky Jack and the Acheron reminds me of the one between Captain Ahab and Moby Dick. Finally, if you ever watched the America's Cup and rejoiced in the strategy that it entails, you will find yourself pleased with the amount of strategy involved in this battle too.",1084665600,5,1898,4.89751552795031
1864559,4,B00008W64E,"Master And Commander shares with Crowe's earlier movie Gladiator something rare in contemporary filmmaking.  Both films actually tell us a story about people and worlds unfamiliar to us.  Too often in ""historical"" films although the dress and settings are in the past the characters display attitudes, beliefs and conflicts that reflect more modern concerns.  What we often get are contemporary ""morality plays"" acted out in costume dramas in either a past age or in outer space.  These have their value but often fail as storytelling.
Master And Commander is a tale of a world (Napoleonic seafaring warfare) in which the characters hold to values and loyalties we do not immediately grasp.  Crowe as Aubrey drives this story according to the imperatives of command.  To succeed in a mission against a superior opponent with whom he is horribly mismatched, Crowe must summon courage, determination, and shrewdness to avoid defeat several times to finally triumph.  The ship's surgeon (Paul Bettany) serves as Aubrey's best friend and sometime conscience questioning Aubrey several times whether he is pursuing his quest against the French warship out of a sense of loyalty and duty or because his pride.  Is Aubrey preserving his self-respect at the expense of the crew's welfare?
The truth is (as in all of us) Aubrey's motives are mixed.  While he does act out of a need to do his duty as England herself is threatened with invasion, Aubrey also does not want to be bested by a French captain.  Still, while his motives may be tainted, Aubrey is not dissuaded from the fight.  Yet any suspicions that the ship's surgeon himself was counseling out of weakness and lack of courage are dispelled in the events to follow.
This is no simple tale of triumph.  The harshness of sea life and the absolute ruthless measures used to maintain order under primitive conditions are not slighted.  The good men are inhumanely sacrificed to save the ship.  Those who fail to do their duty are mercilessly whipped to uphold authority.  Battle at sea is show not so much as gallant rivalry as the savage butchery it was.  Finally, the heavy loss of life of seaman and officer alike in combat shows that success and doing one's duty are quite costly.
It is a certain kind of courage to do something difficult.  It takes a different kind of courage to meet a challenge when there is a real possibility and likelihood one will lose.  Would we have thought it worth the sacrifice and pain to capture just one ship from all the oceans of the world?  Could we have driven others under our responsibility to suffer so much for any goal?  Maybe not.  But Master And Commander shows us men who did and a world we have largely forgotten.  This is an excellent movie that you will watch several times and catch something new each time.  Can we have another film to follow this one?  I hope so.",1084492800,5,2867,4.780487804878049

The brilliant plot is adapted from Patrick O'Brian's two novels written in the 1800's about war hero Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Crowe.  No other actor could have played him better.  He proves that he continually evolves as an actor through every film.  His tremendous talents are rare in modern-day entertainment.  Director Peter Weir leads the cast and crew to creating this masterpiece.  All of the realisms and hardtimes are greatly expressed in this film.  Such tremendous film quality offers audiences a great, unforgettable experience.  The action scenes are intense, keeping the battles raging and the ocean storms like a roller coaster.  Yet, the emotional aspect never dies.  During moments of peace and rest, the expressed struggles keep the emotional tides to the fullest, namely depression and fear.
The elaborate background settings add the entertainment pleasure.  The Oscar winning sound editing and cinematography wonderfully add intensity to the action scenes and desplict the characters' surroundings fuller.  The costume design are accurate to the actual styles of 1805.  The visual effects greatly desplict the realities of the times.  They make audiences feel like they're living that year.
""Master And Commander"" is a great film that will keep audiences watching closely to every scene.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.",1084406400,4,1534,5.38655462184874
1864562,5,B00008W64E,Okay so I'm not big on action movies but I am big fan of great movies and this is definitely one. Master & Commander is not only visually stunning it is a movie that is true to the era in which it is set.,1084406400,,204,3.659090909090909
1864563,4,B00008W64E,"This movie is the most authentic presentation of the age of ""wooden ships and iron men"" ever to grace the silver screen.  There is simply no doubt about that.  The viewer is literally transported and immersed into the brutal and harsh service of the Royal Navy during the era of the Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe perfectly portrays Captain Jack Aubrey (""lucky Jack"") of the Patrick O'Brian novels.  The acting, sets, everything, simply crackle with authenticity.  The attention to detail in this film is astounding.
The storyline is not bad either, although in my opinion it moves a bit slowly.  But the relatively slow pace of the storyline is for a purpose, to draw the viewer into the subtle nuances that the film is trying to convey--that this was a hard age, the Royal Navy of the times was a brutal and merciless service which brooked no disobedience and yet was not lacking in humanity.  Russell Crowe portrays a Captain Aubrey who is both harsh and humane in an age of hardship and adventure.
I deprived this film of the fifth star because I did feel that the storyline could have been made to move at a brisker pace without sacrificing the nuances that the film accomplishes so well.  Others may disagree, and I can understand that.  It may be that with repeated viewings I too will decide that this is a five-star film.  In any case, it is an excellent film, featuring excellent performances, authenticity, and an interesting storyline.",1084406400,3,1448,4.779116465863454

As even many detractors have mentioned, it is a quite realistic look at the Royal Navy of the early 1800's, as well as being beautifully filmed (it earned the Oscar it received for cinematography).  The lead actors did a more than credible job, as did many of the ship's crew.  The point made about the middle of the movie being a bit slow is taken, but to me it was still interesting (I guess I have a longer attention span than 10 minutes).  I deduct 1 star for the lack of extras of any kind on the 1 disc edition, but I will be purchasing the 2 disc edition nonetheless.",1084320000,2,720,4.151079136690647
1864577,5,B00008W64E,"I agree with the other 5 star reviews of this film here on Amazon.com that this film IS highly entertaining... for those seeking action and ALSO for those who love a good story with lots of character study... and in those areas, this film will not disappoint... but I am also have a great passion for the recreation of history, in spirit if not in literal terms... and this film is right ""on target"". It is a work of art consistant with history from the first frame (sensitively designed title text), to the the finale.
I was fortunate to be able to visit the HMS SURPRISE (actually built in 1970 as a replica of a 1750s British warship called the ROSE) used in this film. It is currently docked in San Diego harbour and open to the public. I saw it prior purchasing the DVD. I stood on the actual deck and examined the recreated planking, rigging and details on board, and even up close, it is like stepping back in history... it looks so carefully outfitted. Below deck is a display of the film's costumes, musical instruments and props used in the film behind glass showcased walls, and they are remarkable. The costumes are authentic down to the delicate hand sewn details, the brass with perfect patina, and the china and silver table service looks museum quality... most of it recreated just for this film.
It was no surprise that with such attention to detail, the film has such an authentic look on screen, but what ultimately won my praise for this film was the respect for the ""correctness"" in manners, gesture and story the actors showed here.  Whether it was minutely accurate is not important, but with so many films now on DVD that simply do not care about the historic look or beauty of period film or costume (""Shanghai Knights"" and ""First Knight"" immediately come to mind) it was great to see a work on film that displayed the texture and look of past in such authentic way.  The music, much of it classical, is not all of the period, yet it still felt ""right"" for the film and adds to the sweeping vistas and first rate cinematography... which is remarkable in this filim.
I loved the story, I also thought the characters were wonderfully developed. Crowe is marvelous... and his character showed the intensity, power, determination, loyalty, that a captain would have had... and yet also the sensitive nature and a bit of humor that would have kept his crews loyalty through horrendous times. His portrayal is on a par with his performance in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Gladiator"".
There were many reasons to love this film... overall it is a real adventure. Bravo!!",1084320000,2,2583,4.649890590809628

1864580,4,B00008W64E,"If you've ever seen any of the Horation Hornblower productions on the BBC, then I think this movie will be a letdown for you.  Russell Crowe, while an enjoyable personality overall, comes off as a tad too nice and understanding in this role, while the books about this time (CS Forrester's Hornblower included) portray their Captains more along the lines of booming-voiced autocrats in charge of every aspect of activity in the domain they take SO personally, the ship.  Russell Crowe never seems to boom.  He smiles and winks, and you start to wonder why the murderers and vermin the British Navy pressed into sea duty don't just push him over and sail to Tahiti (oh, sorry - another story)... that is until a crew member disses a midshipman suspected of being a Jonah and Crowe nails the offender to the mast.  And although the movie plays fast and loose with some aspects of sea life from the times, midshipmen very often were young boys whose wealthy parents sent to sea to make men out of them.  It's hard to get used to the 11-year-old barking orders to men 3 or 4 times his age.
Anyway, I have all of the HH movies and have read Forrester, AND enjoyed this movie.  Crowe is handsome, the strategy isn't given away to you, and I was disappointed when it ended.
No ""Making Of..."" included on the disk, which I was disappointed about.",1084233600,5,1338,4.554166666666666
1864581,2,B00008W64E,"I have been an avid reader of the Aubrey-Maturin series. O'Brian was a purist and developed intense, believable characters. This film, unfortunately disappoints. The inane mis-casting of Russell Crowe, with his innapropriate Aussie drawl, is the biggest flaw. He in now way portrays the original character, either in stature or speech. The same can be said for Maturin, who is the ""raison d'etre"" for most of the missions undertaken by H.M.S. Surprise. If one wishes to see the fullness of this crime, read the series. I was soooo dismayed to see this in the theaters. The entire emphasis seems to be on the visual aspects of this work, which standing on their own are creditable, although lacking in many ways to show the immensity of the seafarer's world in Aubrey's time. I can only pray, that like ""Mutiny on The Bounty"", this great epoch will be revisited by artists with clearer intellect and vision. Sorry, but I can not recommend this juvenile epic in any regard.",1084233600,6,971,4.855421686746988

Although I am no Naval Historian, I have seen other peroid pieces (Horatio Hornblower Series, etc...), and they were better in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining, but it lacked more action. The final battle scene could have used a little more work also. I understand that close quarter battle needs to look confining, but from a viewer standpoint, it would have been more enjoyable if you could have seen more of the fight. Not quite the epic masterpiece that a lot of people say that it is, but it was entertaining.",1084147200,2,580,4.696078431372549
1864583,5,B00008W64E,"In the beginning, we are lead around and through a beautiful 18th century wooden ship and are sure we must smell the sea and the wet wood and the mold that must lurk somewhere between. The serenity is broken by fear, then a comforting command decision, and then the source of the fear is proven true but quickly handled by our master and commander. We surely know we, and the ship, are in good hands.
Movies aren't made like this anymore. Peter Weir has given us a very refreshing gift of another world, where a leader can lead without shame and fear of reprocussion. The ship is his world, to make of it as he chooses. And he is a good leader. And we are not ashamed of him, or his beliefs in duty, and truth . . . attributes which are scorned by many in our cynical world today.
I love this movie. It is beautiful. It is a picture of good leadership, combined with humor and gentleness, and Russell Crowe brings it together in a wonderful way.",1084147200,4,945,4.284916201117318

1864597,3,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander"" is a beautifully photographed epic with characters worth our sympathy and an epic story that doesn't rely too heavily on plot manipulation. It's an old-fashioned, exciting, smart movie.
Russell Crowe turns in another great performance, up there with his work in ""LA Confidential"" and ""The Insider"" (I didn't care for his Maximus in ""Gladiator""). As Capt. Jack Aubrey, Crowe exudes authority and often explodes with unexpected wit (I love the joke about the lesser of two evils). He is more than enough reason to see this movie.
Paul Bettany is also terrific as Dr. Stephen Maturin, Aubrey's more intellectual friend/advisor. Why both of these guys failed to pick up at least an Oscar nomination is beyond me.
The movie is enjoyable, well written and tautly directed. Why doesn't it rate higher than 3 stars? Because, in the end, it feels a little too Hollywood, a little too formula, a little too ""safe."" This isn't exactly the edgiest of movies, and I have no argument with ""The Return of the King's"" Best Picture win.

1864599,5,B00008W64E,"This is one of those big movies that I would've dearly loved to have made it to the theaters to see but never found the time which is a bit of a personal disappointment as this film, I'm sure, would've been even that much better on the silver screen.  While this great film has it's glorious battle scenes, it is a film based not so much in big action sequences but more in the intelligent dialogue and narrative.  Few films have so aptly displayed what a harsh life sailors of this particular era lived as well as this film does.  Youthful dreams of such a life may have been deftly squashed for many by seeing the harsh realities displayed in this film.  Simply put, this film is well paced with an apt balance between intense battle scenes and almost an almost poetic script.
For many years now, Russell Crowe has displayed exceptional performances in several movies, showing that he has a wide range of acting abilities and this film is no exception to that as he brings Captain Jack Aubrey to life.  Paul Bettany's performance in this film is quite exceptional as well.  I believe the only other film I've seen him in was another Russell Crowe film in ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Clearly his future performances are to be looked forward to.  Another notable cast member is Billy Boyd, most well known for his role in ""The Lord of the Rings"" as Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took.  Although his role in this film is minor, he does stand out.
Director Peter Weir has had a long and storied career directing in Hollywood with such notable films as ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""Witness.""  This film will certainly go down in the history books as one of his best.
The Premise:
The fate of the British Empire seemingly rests on the shoulders of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as he commands a British Naval warship that is suddenly attacked by a much larger French warship that he's been given the mission to capture or destroy.  After his first fateful encounter with the behemoth he must repair his ship and embarks on a trip spanning two oceans to capture or destroy the French ship or die in the trying...
What follows from there is, as stated above, an extremely well made film that in its dialogue rings to a subtle but poignant tune and its action carries the weight of a big hitter.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}

1864600,5,B00008W64E,"The capitan -played by Russel Crowe- displays the admirable ethics of naval warfare. It starts out when anoter frigate (a huge ship that surpasses the 'Surpise') surprise attacks Crowe's ship. Unlike other movies, this movie doesnt just focus on the revenge. It also unveils the life of a sailor, and shows the hardships that they had to go through.
I really like the story this movie put up. While trying to find the ship and take it over, the crew is met with horrible and gleeful situations. This movie does a marvolus job in describing the world they live in, such as thier expeditions to find new species and thier zeal to explore more lands, also thier doctors and medicine (only other gory part besides the battles) becaue they don't have the medicine that we do today. This movie did an amazing job showing battle ethics, and I think is a masterpiece of it.
What I didn't like personally, was the dry parts, like nothing but talk for a long time but those parts were far in between.
All in all this movie is a masterpiece, all credited to the acting and towards Bruchemier's brillant mind. So 5 stars",1083974400,2,1108,4.57286432160804

Not only is this a great movie, but it is a fantastic DVD.  One thing you really notice is the outstanding picture and audio transfer that made it to this disc.  Even on my small 30"" TV it felt like I was watching this in the theater again.  If you have a DTS capable DVD player, you'll really appreciate the Bruckheimer soundtrack.

The extras on this DVD are where it really stands out.  This thing is packed to the brim with extras.  And I'm talking about quality extras, not a bunch of ""music video"" or ""upcoming trailers"" fluff to fill up the disc.  The extras are all entertaining, and fairly lengthy.  The shortest one on here is the HBO First Look, which is still 25 minutes long.  I almost enjoyed watching the extras as much as the film.",1083715200,8,1335,5.225352112676056

1864605,5,B00008W64E,"If you're like me and like your action films smart, well written, well acted and with plenty of action; then this is the DVD for you. Chances are if you are thinking of buying this DVD right now you already know this is a great movie, but just in case you're not sure, let me tell you why this is one of those movies that definitely belongs in your collection.
The acting, from Russell Crowe (The captain of the HMS Surprise) to Paul Bettany (The ships doctor), down to the most minor character is top notch, and leaves you believing that you are looking through a window in time rather than just watching a Hollywood movie. This film is a historical journey that knocks you back into 18th century naval warfare, and at times with a vengeance. If you happen to own a home theater system (and if you don't you should get one, they're reasonably priced now) you'll be amazed with the sound quality in this film. The action scenes are filled with roaring cannons blasting man and ship into smithereens, ferocious storms at sea where you can almost feel the wind and rain slashing at your face, and fierce pistol/sword fights that fill your senses with the smell of smoke and blood. Like I said at the beginning, if you like action, you've come to the right movie. But read on, it's not all just blood and guts.
What writer/director Peter Weir really does quite masterfully however, is bring you down from all this chaos and conflict with quiet, human, and sometimes humorous scenes that give the viewer an insight into what life on a warship must have been really like in those times. For me, this peek into the world of Captain and Able Seaman alike, is what really sets this movie apart from the ordinary action film. The relationships are well developed and acted to the point where you actually care about the lives of the characters, even the minor ones. The conversations and interactions between the characters on the ship, are believable and interesting, drawing you deep into the story like the novels they are based on. It's this masterful blend of war and peace that makes this movie so commanding (;)). For more than just financial reasons, long ago I decided I was only going to buy the very best movies. The ones that could stand watching over and over again, the ones that could stand the test of time. This is one of those movies.",1083715200,5,2343,4.5545023696682465

1864627,3,B00008W64E,"A big-budget entry into the Napoleonic era so well trodden by Horatio Hornblower, ""Master and Commander"" falls far short of the hype surrounding its release. While the fantastic historicity of the sets and the salty mood is well done and then maintained throughout, the plot is never given the chance to develop: the viewer is simply thrown into the chase of the French frigate by the HMS Surprise with only a few words typed onscreen to explain what follows for two hours.
Additionally, as many reviewers have already noted, a subplot involving the naturalistic interests of the captain's doctor friend stole precious screen time from the rest of the deserving cast.
Finally, and most annoyingly, there is an almost complete lack of a proper end to this 2 hour and ten minute feature. Rather than simply ending the film five minutes earlier, the screenwriters inexplicably decided to create a fascinating plot twist...and then leave it dangling!!! I sat in horror whispering to myself, ""They wouldn't...they couldn't..."" They did. Without revealing too much, it is not the open-ended finale many initial features end with to allude to a sequel. Instead, the cliffhanger plot twist is never resolved, and the so-called ""ending"" falls flat on its face, prompting me to take the time to reveal this embarrassing failure by means of this review.
This is not a bad film. It is simply not as good as either it should have been or as it was reported to have been. For all the millions spent on detail and effects, and for all the star-power of Crowe, Ioan Gruffudd and the producers of A & E's Hornblower series outdo this seafaring tale by a wide margin.",1083628800,2,1649,4.851063829787234

One version is just the movie and it costs just the same as any other DVD (might as well just wait for it to come on cable). The other version (the collectors addition) contains all the extra's that you would find on any other DVD movie only they are expecting you to pay twice as much for something you would normaly get for the regular price of a dvd.

Now this one isn't a creative mental movie like Crowe's earlier part was in A Beautiful Mind, and it lacked the action in Gladiator. Those aspects gave the other movies the acclaim that they received. This one however leaves fighting as a tie-in to all the events going on in their busy personal lives, raise sail here, swab deck there.

I have been on many tours of HMS Victory in Portsmouth and a lot of detail is historically correct ( for example removing the partition walls from the captains cabin when going into action).

1864632,4,B00008W64E,"This film was really a good effort to compress the contents of several Patrick O'Brian novels into a feature length motion picture. The title is also somewhat misleading , since NONE of the events of ""Master and Commander"" are actually portrayed in the film , and the plot heavily relies on ""Far Side of the World"" for most of the story line.
Russell Crowe really becomes Jack Aubrey , and Paul Bettany portrays a fairly true part of the character Steven Maturin.
Unfortunately for the viewing audience , much of Doctor Maturin's role in the novellae is not revealed , that of the Admiralty intelligence officer.
I thought that the portrayal of life aboard a Royal Navy ""Man O'War"" was truly outstanding , and the portrayal of the young midshipmen extermely accurate.
What I really liked about the film:
(1) Excellent scenes of the ship under full sail.
(2) Russell Crowe's portrayal of ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey.
(3) Realistic battle scenes , not for the faint of heart.
What I disliked about the film:
(1) Not enough background on the past history of the major characters.
(2) Story line was abriged too much.
(3) The ending was a little weak , and left LOTS of room for a sequel.
Overall , this is a magnificent story of the sea and the iron men who sailed the wooden ships. It could have related to the Napoleonic wars a bit better. Patrick O'Brian has lots of other good action novels that would possibly make a sequel (or sequels) that would be even better than this film.
A really strong 4 stars , and I highly recommend it. The ""bare bones"" version is a better buy , but the 2 disk set is OK , too.",1083542400,2,1600,4.482876712328767
1864633,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander, the latest Russell Crowe feature, is a story confined to one boat (and a couple of island shots).  You don't even see the enemy...and that's the beauty of the movie.  Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are such great actors and they can carry a film like this, with no sign of the enemy.  After seeing this movie, I find it amazing that sea battles actually had any survivors.  The action is intense and the sound is simply amazing.  The DVD has both a DTS and Dolby 5.1 tracks, and they are some of the best sound mixes out there.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1083542400,2,579,4.364485981308412
1864644,5,B00008W64E,"It was wonderful watching a movie with well-drawn characters that have personalities and humanity with foibles, strengths, fears, and a sense of time and place in history.  I enjoyed the ""quiet"" scenes where we are able to get to know the men of the Surprise.  The friendship between Aubrey (Crowe) and Dr. Mautrin (Bettany) is a glue for the whole movie.  The state of their friendship is a barometer for the state of affairs for the mission of the ship.  Being a musician, I loved the scenes of them passing time making music (and the raucous music of the crew as well).
Max Pirkus plays the 13-year-old Lord Blakeney with amazing skill.  His maturity reminds us of the time when children were not condescended to as creatures of little capacity and less responsibility as they are today.  Some may find such adult expectations of such a young person abhorrent, but given the life expectancy of the times to 13 was to be about a third of your lifespan.  They had to mature early and Lord Blakeney is a wonderful character with emotional strength, courage, and intellect beyond most adults.
There are two major battle scenes and a storm scene off the southern tip of South America that provide the action scenes of the movie.  They are wonderfully done and are quite rousing.  The scenes of surgery on the ship are filmed in a way that is not visually grisly, but so emotionally intense that you will want to look away because of what you might see, but don't.
I think it is always wonderful to capture a past time and place accurately.  While I am not a historian and I am sure that those historians who pay close attention to this period will find things to complain about, I did like the details they captured about the living conditions of a crew aboard such a confined space.  I don't know if all the details are right, but it was fun to watch a movie with details that added to the understanding of the plot rather than making one roll one's eyes at the implausibility of it all.
A great adventure bordering on an epic that is populated with people you would like to get to know and few you would treasure as friends.",1083542400,7,2124,4.51958224543081
1864645,4,B00008W64E,"I've just finished watching the widescreen DVD of Master And Commander: The Far Side of the World and am beginning to realize that, like most if not all film adaptations, this movie serves as merely an overture to the books upon which it is based.  Throughout the movie I found myself wanting more development, to know more about the characters and the time period, and more action.  Of course, this film has plenty of action to offer, waging war on the high seas and Perfect Storm-esque scenes.  However, there is something lacking in this movie that gives me the feeling that it is simply a one-dimensional preview of what the O'Brian novels are about.  That said, I am very eager to read the novels as soon as I get the chance, but if this film were to stand alone, I would have to say that it's a tease.
Now, the reasons why I gave this film four stars.  The cast is very impressive.  Down to every member of the HMS Surprise's crew, I was continously impressed by the authenticity the cast provided to this period piece.  I was skeptical about Russell Crowe, not expecting much more than the usual soft-spoken, stoic hero.  He fit very well into the role of Captain Jack Aubrey, who was mercurial enough to allow Russell Crowe room to exert himself a little bit.  His interaction with Paul Bettany, who charmingly portrayed the ship's Dr. Stephen Maturin, was so intriguing to the point that I did not understand why such emphasis was placed upon Russell Crowe's character and not Paul Bettany's--the two are at the center of this movie.  Only after I did a little bit of research on the books did I realize that O'Brian's story is based on the adventures of these two characters.
Unlike many films set in very particular time periods, this movie did a wonderful job at achieving that authenticity, not just by the cast, but through costumes, the excellent score, exquisite language of the script, special effects and, of course, the sailing ships.
This film left me with the very distinct cry of ""I want more!"" that can be both irritating and exciting.  I am not sure whether or not there is another film in the works, but it would be ridiculous to leave the ending open as it is.  However, I also was left with a strong curiosity for the books which, I would imagine, is what the filmmakers would like to say is the point of the movie.",1083456000,5,2342,4.55
1864646,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is my kind of movie.  The quality of production is very high, the acting is high caliber, and the fighting scenes are well-done.  It is what an action/adventure film should be.
Too many action/adventure films rely on special effects, lots of explosions, and star charisma to entertain the audience.  Unfortunately, most such films tend to feature sub-par acting, lousy script, and a loose plot.  However, Master and Commander manages to entertain the audience with superb acting performances from Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, and the young Max Pirkis.  There's a lot of action, however, not enough to overwhelm the plot of the film or the characters.
To me, this film falls in the same category(...).  It is high quality adventure.",1083456000,,779,5.046875
1864647,2,B00008W64E,"I have to include myself in the ""not impressed"" minority here, simply because any story or depth is lacking. The movie is well made, no one doubts that, and it looks incredible. There are moving scenes, and most of those involve either the little blonde haired kid (you either feel sorry for him, or think he's uber-courageous), or the doctor of the ship feeling sorry for himself because he can't study the islands. The movie tries hard to have ""depth"" by adding these side stories of the Galapagos islands rest-stop, the ""sensitive"" doctor, and the ""wow, those are little kids in the midst of battle!"" But these portions aren't explored enough to really add much flavor to story that's basically about a ship trying to engage in battle with another ship. French ship blasts English ship, English ship limps away and hides, English ship recovers, English ship searches French ship for revenge. The rest, the human story, is just garnish. It was like drinking sugar water. No nutrition here at all. However, they do try hard to add a sense of atmosphere and history. Which works. For awhile.

1864648,3,B00008W64E,"Don't get me wrong.  This is one of the best movies of the year and probably the best seafaring film in the last thirty (not counting submarine movies), but this DVD could take a cue or two from the franchise that totally beat it out last year The Lord of the Rings.  Peter Jackson knows how to treat his fans and he knows that giving us something besides the pathetic HBO first look documentary and only a FEW, albeit insightful, behind the scenes vignettes can go a long way to racking up DVD sales and creating a buzz around a film with the DVD release instead of it being some forgotten day in the middle of April (oh, did Master and Commander come out this week?  Maybe I'll pick that up sometime).
Who else is tired of DVDs proclaiming deleted scenes as such a big bonus?  Either incorporate them back into the movie or get rid of them.  It seems all the studio or Peter Weir has to do is sweep up the cutting room floor and dump all of the garbage onto a disc and we'll buy it for a few dollars more (well I did, but you don't have to).
No commentary either.  None.  LOTR has no less than four.  FOUR per movie.  This film, one of the greatest historical dramas and historically accurate portrayals of the napoleonic wars (not actual events, but methods) gives us no insight from the mind behind the movie (director and co-writer of a truly fantastic period script as far as period scripts go).  Peter Weir has to wake up.  I consider him to be among the few directors to have never had a misstep in his career (Fearless being the closest).  All he does is make perfect movies, but a little love for emerging technology couldn't hurt his fan base.  I would even have settled for a Collee or Crowe commentary.  Anything.
To sum up.  This is a five star movie, but a three star DVD.  The other version is a two star DVD, but for 5 bucks less it's probably worth it because you still get the best part - the movie.",1083456000,3,1918,4.271468144044321
1864649,3,B00008W64E,"I found it amusing that Amazon paired this with the Tom Hanks flick Cast Away for the ""Best Value"" - these movies are very similar in speed and action.  Way too much getting from point ""A"" to point ""B"", with little occurring once we arrive at point ""B.""  This is definitely a film about the journey, not the destination, ie, the fast frightening French Frigate (say that five times!)
Our intrepid Captain Crowe seems to be a bit behind the times in naval warfare and very slow on the uptake.  One gets the impression that he blunders his way through challenges. I was grateful for the 8x fast forward speed on my DVD player, as I was thankfully able to skip over a lot of the fluff.",1083456000,2,682,4.354330708661418
1864650,5,B00008W64E,"Since the plot of ""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" is easily available on this website, I will reserved my comments for the DVD. IMO it is wonderful! I am one who seeks out widescreen DVDs rather than full screen, and I found the picture and sound quality to be nearly identical to what I experienced upon first seeing the movie in the theatre. Those who found the movie ""too dark"" or had trouble understanding some of the dialogue will no doubt have the same criticism of the DVD presentation, but neither were a problem for me. The bonus material is excellent in my opinion. I particularly enjoyed the made-for-DVD documentary ""The Hundred Days,"" which takes the viewer behind the scenes of the making of the movie, and ""In The Wake of O'Brian,"" a shorter documentary where Weir answers some of the questions about the focus of the movie that bothered many devotees of the canon. There are also short documentaries that cover the battle scenes, audio effects, and the storm scene, which are of especial interest to movie buffs. There is a companion booklet that would be helpful for those not familiar with the series and/or the careers of Peter Weir and Patrick O'Brian. The small map included is a little gimicky in my opinion, but your children or grandchildren might like it! I feel that the two-disc set is well worth the few extra dollars, especially for those of us who are interested in the art and science of movie production.",1083369600,6,1455,4.665369649805448
1864651,3,B00008W64E,"M&C is not the best film you will ever see, nor is it the best marine film you will ever see, or the best war film you will ever see, but it is nautical miles ahead of the other disastrous `pirate movies' (M&C is a mix of oldskool pirate films and war on the sea genres), except for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which has set a standard that M&C can not seem to match - except on the acting/dialogue front and possibly the cinematography, however the choreography for the action sequences is not good, appears disjointed, and many elements of the story are simply left to drift ashore while we sail through a boring patch of the four seasons.
M&C is a film of many elements (Darwin, science vs war, superstitions, commanders matching wits), but sadly remains somewhat disengaging throughout the whole affair and this is a problem of not fleshing out the characters enough... or trying to cope with too many characters. In fact we learn very little, if nothing, of our heroic sailors save for the various moments in Captain Jack's (Crowe) dining quarters where he makes some philosophical statements about sailing and that is that. Emotions are derived from watching children die in the heat of battle and although at times this is gruelling to watch, you will soon get board of this theme.
Film director Peter Weir does miss the mark as many critics have pointed out. While correctly opting for lots of battle sequences, he doesn't pull everything off so well and confusion reigns in several key action moments. So when the camera is not focused on cannon shells flying through masts it is drifting between umpteen characters and ship hands who all have a line, but little more than that. Even one of our favourite hobbits (Boyd) only shows up for a few scenes. Also Crowe's role is almost eclipsed by Paul Bettany playing Dr. Stephen Maturin the Surgeon who becomes a major pivotal character and a plot device, but this is because M&C looses control of who should be at the helm at times but never really tries to be anything more than just a battle between two boats on the sea (The Brits on the `Surprise' vs Napoleon's `Acheron'). For this reason many who go to see the acting will get a little of what they wanted. Those who want to see planks splinter and riggings hurtling through the air will get their fair share of that too. However together the gel doesn't really glue and something tells this reviewer that some more character development on the pivotal roles would have a gone a long way.... even to the far side of the world. While this movie has mammoth production values (everything looks sublime and the boats awesome) a finely tuned script would not have hurt this piece one little bit.
Weir has given us a good movie that is well worth watching but does not really register as something you will remember the next day. As far as the DVD release goes, you will certainly find a lot worse and for all intensive purposes this is a family film with some moderate historical violence. I guess if you are looking for a more gung-ho ""Gladiator"" type of film you will disappointed. Like I said in the title of the review ---  A Good Sunday Afternoon Shipper... but little more than that.",1083283200,2,3200,4.604203152364273
1864652,5,B00008W64E,"Wow! What a spectacular adventure! I thought to myself after seeing this movie. Even the slow parts kept my attention. It could have been a six-hour mini-series and I still would have sat through it!
Within the short time of watching life abroad the HMS Surprise, I felt as if I was part of the crew, I knew the men so well. The studious ship surgeon, salty old seamen, insecure junior officers, and the crusty cook. Of course, none commanded the respect of the captain, ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey.
Russell Crowe demands the same respect from the audience as he did in ""Gladiator,"" as someone who leads by his presence, strength, and umimpeachable sense of duty. The viewer feels his conviction as he orders his men to pursue the French ""Acheron,"" a more powerful warship that has already crippled his ship. In a desperate race, he patches up the ship and pursues it around South America chasing it into deadly high seas contest.
Even though Aubrey comes across as a ""nice guy"" much of the time, it's clear he is ""master and commander"" and tolerates no disrespect, be it a mouthy seaman or his best friend.
While Crowe drives much of the movie, it is also fueled by an equally strong performance by Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's surgeon and naturalist. What makes him such a strong foil for Crowe is not their differences, but their similarities. Both are driven by a sense of duty, but their goals are different and conflicting. Knowing they are close friends makes their conflict all the more intense.
The sense of realism strikes true for much of the film too. You can feel the freezing winds of the Horn, experience the loneliness of a professional sailor's heart, hear the snapping lines in the gale, smell the stench of gunpowder, and feel the heat of the doldrums. I think the only thing I couldn't experience was the food, (these guys eat all the time!) which was probably a good thing. (Saused pig's head? Yeach!)",1083196800,,1920,4.666666666666667
1864653,4,B00008W64E,"I liked this movie alot, and would have given it five stars, but for the inacurate portrayal of Marine Iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.  Read the other reviews for information on the acting and action, I am writing to stand up for the lowly Iguana.
Just about every rocky shoreline in the Galapagos Islands is home to the marine iguana, the only sea-going lizard in the world. The marine iguana is an extraordinary animal which lives on land but grazes on a variety of seaweed, either on exposed rocks or by diving into the cold seawater. This habit, totally unique in iguanas, provides them with an abundant food source but can make them vulnerable to predation by sharks and other large fish.
In the movie, there are scenes reminiscent of Darwin's ""Voyage of the Beagle"", many of the characters are seen collecting what are supposed to be marine iguanas.  However, are these actual Galapagos marine iguanas?  No.  These are actually the common Green Iguanas of South America.  They are not even using costumes or makeup, just their natural green skin.  It is like they are acting on the stage.  Do these iguanas get credit at the end of the movie?  No!  Like Kermit the frog said, Its not easy being green.  Real marine iguanas are ugly dark colored brutes you would never want to meet in a dark alley, but common green iguanas are our friends.
This was a great movie, it just doesn't give proper credit to the iguanas.",1083196800,3,1422,4.652
1864654,5,B00008W64E,"what an enjoyable movie.  i came to this movie very hesitantly.  my wife was (is) an avid o'brian fan, but i could never get into the books.  she's read them all, but i struggled to even get into the first one.  when the movie came out, though, i took her to it knowing that i would be quite bored but making my wife happy (always a good thing).
instead, i was completely enthralled.  the movie captures the feel of what life must have been like on a tiny boat in the middle of a vast ocean.  the need for discipline, the importance of authority come through so well because that was what held the shipboard society together.
it was little things that really grabbed me:  the men eating on wooden plates, for example.  the unique way of saluting (but the use of either hand to salute was acceptable).  i think this movie captures the feel of that life so well.
some reviewers have griped about the relative lack of plot, and the galapagos subplot.  to me, that seems to be more an effort to keep the spirit of the books alive in the movie.  the stephen/jack relationship is very dynamic because they are friends but jack is ostensibly stephen's superior.  if jack makes exceptions for stephen, he would be violating the chain of authority that holds their ship together.  and yet, stephen's sense of honor is betrayed.  a fascinating thing to me.
so, after watching it in the theater, i did read the first book, and enjoyed it very much.  the movie helped to put the books in context and i learned how to capture the feel of what o'brian is trying to convey.
i rarely buy dvd's, but this was a wonderful exception.  you simply cannot catch everything that goes on by watching it only once.  and i've found the extras in this set to be a wonderful addition to my understanding.  i think the second book is going to be even better after watching this dvd.  i can't wait.

  Peter Weir is a wonderful story teller and transports us back to navy life in 1805 aboard the HMS Surprise off the coast of South America. The sights sounds, and action of  a navel battle of this era is captured like no other film ever has but Weir  does not allow it to eclipse the human story of friendship, honor, trust and loyalty and allows us the feel what life on board a man o war was trully like.
Russell Crowe is excellent as Captain Lucky Jack Aubrey and Paul Betteny is equal to the task as Dr Maturin. Both ahve captured essence of O'brians characters and along with and excellent supporting cast, wonderful effects and a great story, Master and Commander the Fare Side of the World is not only one of the best pictures made last year but in my opinion  the best picture of its kind ever made.

1864656,3,B00008W64E,"I came to M&C as a die-hard O'Brian fan - all 20 books, multiple audio editions, etc. - very excited to see the story on-screen, but wondering how Weir could do them justice.  In contrast to two recent favorite blockbuster-books-to-movies, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, both of which are filled with action and visual imagery, the Aubrey-Maturin books are mostly interior: Aubrey muses on the wind, weather, tide, or enemy strategy, and Maturin on the politics of Catalonia, the classification of birds, or the psychology of seamen - all with a wealth of impressively-researched detail, and in a style close to Jane Austen.  The screenwriters managed to render as much of the story in action as possible, a change really required by the medium, and to do so handsomely.
  The balance of characters, however, was a catastrophe.  The books are called ""the Aubrey-Maturin series"" because they revolve around the double-star of these two characters, whose strengths and failings interlock like yin and yang.  Maturin is, if anything, the more fully-realized, being closer to the author's own personality and voice.  In reshaping the story as a (single) star vehicle for Russell Crowe, Aubrey's more humanizing foibles were cast adrift. For example, in the book, Aubrey shares the anecdote of Nelson asking him to ""pass the salt"" with blatant hero-worship untouched by any trace of irony; in the film, he is sardonic & self-mocking, ""in on the joke"" in a way that naturally belongs to Maturin, not himself.
  The problem is compounded by the unfortunate casting of Paul Bettany as Maturin.  He is a fine actor, but far too suave, handsome, and socially poised for the role, which wants a strong personality and an actor willing to be unattractive (...).  The fact that Crowe and Bettany got along well on an earlier project may have made for smoother filming, but a clash of more-equally-sized personalities might have made a stronger movie.",1083110400,,1942,5.018691588785047

Unfortunately, the story itself is rather plodding and does /not/ do Patrick O'Brain's novel justice.  The plot is essentially a cat and mouse game between Captain Aubrey (British) and a French ship in 1805.  There are subplots-such as leadership, bonding of the crew, superstition, and the brilliant seamanship of the Captain.  The ship's doctor is a very interesting character-both caring, scientific minded, but aboard a warship.  Unfortunately, none of these aspects are ever explored in enough depth to give take the movie to the next level.  There was a lot of potential for storytelling squandered.

  That said, it is a very good, rather uncomplicatted movie. Lots of little bits on life at sea with the Royal Navy in 1805. Aside from the obvious conflict with the the French ship, & the pursuit of it, Capt. Jack has few problems. There is none of the passion of the Bounty or Capt. Ahab chasing Moby Dick.
  He has a row with his best friend & ship's surgeon/ scientist. It provides a sub-plot, that is mended later. The ship's company grumbles about a lashing, a lack of water & the ship being ""in irons"" for days. But those last two are hardly Capt. Jack's fault. At least there was plently of rum & the crew stayed loyal. Capt. Jack was consistent throughout the movie. He was decent, urbane  his crew loved & admired him & that didn't change. Plus he had some amusing stories about his two encounters with Lord Nelson, Britain's greatest super-hero of the day.

1864660,4,B00008W64E,"Russell Crowe does a solid job as the British captain ordered to hunt down a French ship. His crew includes some interesting characters, but the main focus is on how the captain handles the multitude of situations he faces. For example, at one point the captain must decide between saving one of his crew vs. endangering the rest of them in the rescue attempt. Pretty heavy stuff. I rather enjoyed this leadership aspect of the film because it forces the viewer to think through ""what would I do in that situation"".

One thing I did not like was the Darwin like sub-plot that involves the ship's doctor and his desire to explore the Galapogos islands. Some might find this interesting stuff, but I thought it was rather distracting and took away from the momentum during the second half of the film.

I am a big fan of military history, but usually prefer ground combat to naval engagements. Having said that, Master and Commander is very entertaining, and gives what I consider to be an accurate portrayal of naval warfare in the early 1800s. Most of the sailor's time is spent in mundane tasks (like daily maintenance of the vessel), with occasions of great excitement during combat engagements. The director does a great job with the fighting scenes. He captures the chaos involved that leaders faced, and the courage required of the crew to gain victory.

I recommend this film to anyone interested in how naval combat was fought during this time period. If you are a Russell Crowe fan, you will also enjoy it, although it is not his best.",1083110400,,1543,4.707407407407407

A trip of this sort is challenging enough for a sailor of today -- imagine undertaking it when you had no high-tech equipment to rely upon, but rather intelligence, strategy, a lot of hard work, and luck.

Also, stunningly, I looked and checked and for some reason I guess I assumed there'd be some sort of actor's or director's commentary for this film. NOPE! This DVD package is highly overpriced and somewhat disappointing, akin to the film which I did not see in the theaters. There are some sweeping scenes and beautiful imagery, but some of the visual concepts were ripped right off from the 1984 epic, The Bounty, starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (still, probably the greatest nautical film ever shot, in my opinion). Master and Commander has some strengths but this could be one of the most overrated films in a long time. The crew seems too happy, even after getting their butts spanked by the frogs and Lucky Jack is just too jovial for the most part. This is one of Russel Crowe's weaker efforts and he seems to be too impressed with himself on screen with this work. I'd have given this a two and a half star rating if I could have figured out how to do the half-star thing. Master and Commander is to The Bounty what U-571 is to Das Boot. Nice try, but it's just not as good as the originals they were trying to copy, although Master and Commander gives us some excellent glimpses into naval cannon warfare, clearly it's greatest accomplishment in this film.",1083024000,,1724,4.618892508143323

Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is about the most likable and mild-mannered sea-faring Captain since Captain Kangaroo; a casting mistake if ever there was one.  The ship's more level headed doctor (Paul Bettany) seems more like an early nineteenth century character dealing with tragedy on a daily basis.  The plot is terribly simple with battle after battle with buddy bonding scenes around the dinner table spliced in between.  The only original highlights are the Galapagos scenes.  However, one must give high points to Weir for his realistic battles, ships and special effects.  The sounds are inspiring and everything looks and sounds true.  In fact, the effects are the true stars of this film.  I can't say I would recommend purchasing this DVD, but a viewing on a boring Sunday afternoon would do it justice.  There are some standard trailers and the widescreen format can't be beat with any epic story.  2 stars for story and 4 stars for visuals and sound seem fair.",1082937600,7,1234,4.884615384615385
1864674,2,B00008W64E,"First of all, I will get my bias out of the way and say I haven't seen that many ""sea"" movies that I have liked.  So when I saw this one, and came to realize that it is more about the relationship of two characters, Russel Crowe (Captain) and Paul Bettany (ship's surgeon,) then I realized I just did not like it.  Now this one isn't a creative mental movie like Crowe's earlier part was in A Beautiful Mind, and it lacked the action in Gladiator.  Those aspects gave the other movies the acclaim that they received.  This one however leaves fighting as a tie-in to all the events going on in their busy personal lives, raise sail here, swab deck there.  Give it a chance; because open-minded is better than close-minded, still I felt personally disappointed by the movie more than anything.",1082937600,,791,4.503496503496503
1864675,3,B00008W64E,"As much as I enjoy a Navy war epic, and appreciate the work that went into the accuracy of this account, I have to admit I found this movie to be otherwise unremarkable.  It's a generic story about a man who is following his orders in the Navy and all the highs and pitfalls associated with his duties.  Russell Crowe is a hottie, always has been, and made the movie even easier to sit through.  I also like the interplay between the Captain and the Doctor, who basically acted as the Captain's conscience in the film.  But we've seen this film before, with other titles.  This was not in any way novel.  As much as I enjoyed it, it is what it is: overrated.",1082937600,,658,4.266129032258065
1864676,5,B00008W64E,"If you have heard negative criticism of this movie, please don't listen! Clear your mind. Go in with an open mind ready to receive a favorable impression!
Why this plea?!?! Well, I was quite depressed when my 20-something year old friends panned the movie & said it was one of the worst ever.
If you are brand new to O'Brian & his works, then it may help for you to understand a few things. O'Brian was a tireless historian & naturalist. Every battle in his books (not those in the movie, though) were battles that really happened with the 19th century British Navy. All the details of the ship build, the meals eaten, the language, the countries visited, etc. are all true to the times. And, thankfully, the movie has been very faithful to this detail.
However, I think my friends were confusing the glimpse we get at this distant culture with their modern day version of life. For instance, in the movie the captain makes a truly shameless pun which WAS said at the time...it shows you the kind of humor the sailors used to get through their tough life. However, my friends took that to be the humor of the movie itself, which is a very different thing. The humor in the script is a very subtle one based on character development & understanding.
So, that all said, I think the movie was absolutely fantastic. You have to pay attention some to see where minor characters are developed, where dialogue is important, and where subtle themes are brought through the movie (which you can do with many viewings of the DVD). But, if you do, I don't think you will be disappointed. I think Weir does a masterful job of bringing together great action scenes & fine, tender themes.
As for the cast:
- Crowe was a flawless Captain Aubrey. He really makes the movie, and everything hangs on his performance. You believe in his integrity, his care & his grit.
- Bettany was a very good match as the doctor. He showed both the strength of his personality (a good balance for Aubrey) and also his neurotic weaknesses.
- Boyd (a plug for the LOTR actor) did quite admirably in a very different role for him. Rather than act as the ignorant mischief-maker (Pippen), he is the go-to sailor. He is there at crunch-time & is fully reliable. He seems to have enjoyed this role & filled it well.
- The rest of the crew filled in their places admirably in order for you to be truly absorbed in this tale.
And, finally, perhaps one of the most riveting aspects that they captured so well was the ship's delicate constitution - not the boat but the crew. They had to bear tight quarters, extreme weather, sickness, lack of food, battles & traumatic losses - all while staying strong & preparing for the next challenge. I thought this movie did a phenomenal job in showing how the sailors and officers lived & survived emotionally in such a world. (And the sound track draws this out beautifully as well!)",1082937600,4,2882,4.5442307692307695
1864677,4,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir directs this high seas adventure with skill and a great eye; the film received an Academy Award for cinematography, and the action and effects are terrific.  Russell Crowe stars as Lucky Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is his friend and ship's surgeon as the ship battles a French phantom ship in this adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's series of books.  Some liberties are taken with the books, probably wisely; for instance, the protagonists battle the French during the Napoleonic wars rather than fighting the Americans in 1812.  Max Pirkis is excellent as a young seaman, and Billy Boyd does well in a small part as the crew fights for, and admires, their inspirational captain.  Sometimes the language is difficult to understand, so it helps to watch with the subtitles on.  There is some gore in the battle scenes and aftermath, but there is humor as well.  The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish, with optional English or Spanish subtitles.",1082937600,,966,4.895705521472393

However, the movie really took an interesting turn after the ""lesser than two weevil's"" joke.  It was a decent pun by Russell Crowe, who is the Master and Commander of the boat, which is probably some inspiration for the title.  However, the officers laughed an awful lot at the pun; in fact, excessive in my opinion.  This was okay, but the weevil joke resurfaced again later in the movie and that was really the straw that broke the camel over the back for me.  There was a long scene at the end where everyone fights and also some Francais but I felt the damage had already been done.",1082937600,,711,4.404580152671755

This is well written, well directed, well shot, well acted, well scored, humourous, action packed, thoughtful, with fantastic effects that for the most part you don't even notice are effects (perhaps more a testament to how engrossed I was than anything else).
Seeing it again on DVD I have to concede it loses some of the big screen impact but what adventure doesn't?
I could got into the plot in detail but why spoil things, you don't have long to wait for things to happen in any case. Rent / buy the movie sit down and let things take their own course. If you're at all squeamish then there are one or two points at which you may need to close your eyes, or perhaps your mind's eye as nothing is ever really too graphic it just seems that way because the director has led you to what is happening rather than presenting it in the modern 'in your face style'. If you like action it's there, if you like the majestic tall ships of old they are beautifully recreated. Russel Crowe is perfect as Captain Aubrey and wonderfully played off against Paul Bettany's ships doctor.
If you like older movies for their craft but appreciate more modern production values (particularly cgi guys who appreciate the value of keeping as many shots as possible anchored in reality by using real footage as the foundation) then this will delight you. The waves around the Horn are built upon footage shot there. Some of the sequences set on the Galapagos islands were filmed there. They had a real ship that they used at sea with a full-size recreation gimballed in the water tank and immaculately crafted large scale models all blended together seamlessly on celluloid. You've got to love it for the attention to detail if nothing else.
Watch. Be delighted. This is a keeper.
P.S. This is one of the most interesting extras disks I have seen - it really adds to your appreciation of the job done in producing this film.",1082937600,,1991,4.564245810055866
1864680,5,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is probably the best movie ever made about life aboard an early 19th Century naval vessel. There is an epic storytelling quality here that is reminiscent of  classics like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". It also has a grace and elegance not often seen in movies - epic or otherwise - these days.
Ironically, all these fine qualities may have limited its commercial appeal. The bulk is the movie is about the two main characters - Capt. Jack Aubrey [Russell Crowe] and the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin [Paul Bettany] and their relationship with each other and with the rest of the crew. There are only two major battles scenes, which, while impressive, run only a few minutes each.
Capt. Aubrey is commander of the Surprise, a rather small and outdated British vessel. The Napoleonic Wars are in full swing, and England is in danger of invasion by the French. Aubrey and crew are off the coast of Brazil, where they spot a very fast and modern French ship. Aubrey decides to pursue it, and the chase takes him all the way around the tip of South America to the Galapolos Islands off the coast of Chile. There, the final confrontation between the two vessels takes place.
Crowe and Bettany are superb as two friends whose differences make them perfect counterpoints. To those who are more into narrative than action, watching these two play off each other is the highlight of the movie.
""Master and Commander"" is marvelous entertainment and quite possibly the best big studio movie of 2003.",1082851200,,1570,4.750915750915751

There are a lot of little stories going on in the main story, which is pretty cool. There's the main story, about the rivalry of the two ships, the friendship story between the doctor and a young boy, and a few others that run on and off in the movie.
If you liked movies like Pirates of the Caribbean and Pearl Harbor, this movie is a 'must-watch'. Even if you didn't it's still worth watching. I wouldn't buy it before you have watched it, because it's one of those 'make-or-break' movies, but it's without a doubt worth a five dollar rental.",1082851200,,753,4.424460431654676

I tried twice to sit down and watch this movie but each time my mind wandered to other things. The movie simply did not grab my interest or attention in the least.
Naval battle.... get drunk and eat... naval battle... get drunk and eat... that got old real fast.
I found myself grabbing magazines to read and other things to distract me while this movie played.
The second time I turned to my wife and asked... ""Do you mind if I stop this movie ?""
Her reply.... ""Go ahead. I'm not watching it anyway. I fell asleep first time and this time I'm doing needlepoint. This film is lame and boring.""
So we never made it past about 50 minutes before just giving in to pure boredom and the mental torture of dragging thru this bloated artsy-fartsy film.
Great cinematography... great costumes.... great historical accuracy... but if I want a documentary I'll watch History Channel and actually enjoy a real history lesson.... not Hollywood's attempt at being cerebral or whatever.",1082851200,6,1152,4.624390243902439

I cant see why some people are turned off by the dialogues and the music. Crowe did another masterful job in portraying a real hero, who is able to admit mistakes. If you cant pay attention more than 5 mins this movie is not for you.",1082851200,,451,4.445783132530121
1864695,5,B00008W64E,"This is an amazing action movie set on the high seas, and I especially mean high when they are rounding cape horn.  I had watched the movie through once and felt I had missed a lot because much of the dialog seemed gibberish.  I immediately watched it a second time with closed captioning on and it helped a lot.
This movie has humor action and a certain reality of sea warfare.  Imagine a 12 year old officer, son of a lord commanding a group of low born navel sailor.  If you had a hard time imagining Luke Skywalker leading Rogue Squadron at age 16 and Princess Leia leading the rebels at age 19, how about age 12.  This was the royal navy in 1805.  A 16 year old was a third Lt. ranking high enough to join the officers mess and lead men into a battle.  And the navy men followed.
The movie is PG13 but the violence was not gory.  There is no nudity or cursing that we recall so we judge this movie to be family friendly.  More evidence that a director can make a great movie with a superior script, great acting and outstanding cinematography and special effects.  The opening battle with the sound of projectiles flying by makes you feel you are right there.. Makes you want to duck down.
Russell Crowe is incredible as the extremely bright, creative naval tactician and captian of the HMS Surprise who leads his men with a positive, confident swagger.  The men have nicknamed him Lucky Jack Aubrey.
So many things make this an outstanding movie that I must give it a, rare for me, 5 star rating.  The one annoyance of the unclear dialog, actually helps the viewer feel like they are in 1805 British times.",1082764800,,1612,4.390572390572391
1864696,4,B00008W64E,"It's not done as often as we would like to think but, here is a movie that is a perfect marriage of style and substance. This is especially hard to find in American films, foreign directors such as Federico Fellini or Akiria Kurosawa had the ability to do many times over.
 When ""Master and Commander"" was first released I didn't want to see it. It's not that I thought it was good to be a bad film, but it just simply didn't appeal to my senses. I wasn't until I noticed both of the critics for our papers here in Chicago placed the movie on their ""top ten"" lists that I decided to see it.
 ""Master and Commander"" is just a visual feast for the eyes. This is one of the few times I completely agree with the Academy. This movie deserved every nomination it received, well maybe except ""best picture"". But still, this is really an enetertaining film from beginning to end. The cinamatography, the sets, the production designs, visual effects, and the music, these are the real stars of the film. Without these things I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the movie as much as I do. All of these things come into place. They all add to the mood the film is trying to create. Almost everything here seems believeable.
 The plot in a movie like this really doesn't matter. The important thing to do is just sit back and relax. In fact I'm disappointed I didn't see this movie on the big screen. That must have been an experience.
 Russell Crowe plays Capt. Jack Audrey, a likeable captain who has the respect of his men. They soon find themselves under attack from a French ship. One that is bigger and has more men. That is a vague over view of this film. As I said the plot doesn't matter, I don't want to spend too much time discussing it.
 All of the acting is convicing. I found the relationship between Crowe and Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) to be very interesting. They are old friends and to me seem to be fighting for the other's respect. The doctor has no command on the ship but sometimes Aubrey listens to him.
 I've heard people say this is a masterpiece, one of the greatest films they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far. But, this is a good old-fashion piece of Hollywood storytelling. Director Peter Weir has really accomplished something here.
 Bottom-line: Nominated for 10 Oscar, the film almost deserved every nomination. A perfect marriage for style and substance. Wonderful to look, but it also has a story. Believeable characters and situations mixed with visual eye candy make this a must see.",1082764800,2,2518,4.520879120879121

This definitely detracted from our enjoyment to the point that we were glad when it finally ended.  The cinematography is exceptional.  The story was hard to follow (mostly because we couldn't understand the dialog).  If there had been subtitles it would have helped!

What I have gotten used to and missed here was the commentary that usually comes with DVDs.  If you want that, you have to pay for the 2CD set...:-(
Also, if you have a regular TV (30 inches or less) the letterbox effect of the wide screen version cuts out 50% of the viewing area, which ruins the special effects that made this movie so awesome in the theaters.
The Wide screen version is a good investment for the future.  If you want to see the action up close, get the regular version and if you want the commentaries and the making of the movie (which I do) buy the 2 CD set.

Peter Weir is a very good director but has little to work with as Crowe goes beyond character and tries to utter failure to not be a part of the movie but be the movie itself.
In Weir movies often the landscape becomes a character in and of itself - think for instance of Picnic at Hanging Rock. However here he loses this advantage and opportunity. I know that the Hollywood money men make decisions to formula but keeping Weir from creating the landscape character of the ship and sea is really inexcusable.

For those who have read the books, you will see all your favorite bits compiled in this movie (the 'lesser of two weavils,' etc), plus some truly stunning filming. The battle scenes are brilliant, and extremely accurate (perhaps more so than any other nautical period piece I have ever seen).  While the part of Stephen Maturin is sadly miscast (and he never gets to show off his role as a secret agent extraordinaire), Russell Crowe makes a surprisingly believable and effective Jack Aubrey.  However, this may have been a mistake as well, since the Jack Aubrey series by Patrick O'brian spans 21 novels, and Russell Crowe is nothing if not an expensive actor, I wonder if the movie people can ever afford to do any sort of a sequel of what is admittedly, a genre of limited appeal.  It may have been better to emulate the makers of 'Lord of the Rings and hire relatively unknown actors and film several films at once!

1864712,4,B00008W64E,"Do you feel you are missing films thanks to your local Cineplex, which only features the most high-profile projects, and therefore excludes independent features? Or do you ever feel that by taking a weekend or so off from the movies that you missing some great films? And then you hear you friends chatting about them, it makes the already bad situation even worse? Many can lay claim to being in that very situation, missing out on noting-worthy independent and less commercial films that eventually found their way to be acknowledged by the Motion Picture Academy at the 76th Annual Academy Awards in February 2004, while others weren't quite so lucky. Such note-worthy features that failed to receive recognition include Bad Santa, Phone Booth and The Singing Detective. This isn't to say that nominated projects such as Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and Lost in Translation aren't worthy of acknowledgment, far from it. It is to say this one thing in Hollywood has yet to change: The bigger the studio, the bigger the trophy case will be.
The story is based on the tenth novel, ""The Far Side of the World"" in the ""Master and Commander"" series by Patrick O'Brian, who wrote twenty installments of the high-seas adventure series until his death in January 2000. The feature starts off in 1806 - Napoleon has proclaimed himself emperor of France after a failed attempt on his life and from there wages a military campaign which conquers Italy, Genoa, Vienna, and most of Austria and Germany. The Third Coalition, which consisted of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Sweden, has all but been decimated by severe defeats on land, thus leaving Britain and its advanced naval sea power as the only thing standing in the way of Napoleon and total victory over Europe. One of Britain's most impressive ships is the HMS Surprise, captained by the ambitious and commanding Jack Aubrey, who travels the world with his friend Stephen Maturin, who is also the ship's doctor. Along the Eastern coast of South America, Aubrey and his crew are ambushed by the French frigate, the Acheron. Though they escape in relatively one piece, the ship is deeply weakened and there is talk of turning back home to England. Faced with the fate of his crew and his country in his hand, Jack Aubrey must show true leadership by putting everything on the line and making quick decisions, no matter the cost. The story for Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of the few films out there that embroils itself deeply in a certain time period of history but doesn't require its audience to have such extensive knowledge of events that it alienates certain demographics. Though the film doesn't demand background knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars, it certainly wouldn't hurt if you go in with at least some idea of the events that the story surrounds itself with.
Though Master & Commander contains a rather large cast, few have actually made a name for themselves that they are easily recognizable by a majority of the movie-going audience but that doesn't matter so much in that only one person requires the audience's full attention, that being Russell Crowe. Crowe, who won an Academy Award for his performance in Gladiator and was nominated for A Beautiful Mind, was certainly worthy of at least a nomination with his commanding performance as Captain Jack Aubrey, in which he combines slight humor, enduring emotions, and dignified atmosphere that envelops the audience and keeps them focused with the actions on screen. Unfortunately, despite the film itself receiving ten nominations, the academy failed to recognize Crowe's amazing performance but that is easily forgettable as long as the audiences that watch this film get their money's worth of the film, thanks mostly to Crowe's engaging Jack Aubrey. And it's not just Crowe but the character's actions within the film itself ... the fact that he darts across the deck of the ship in an attempt to be almost everywhere at once, his ability to be charming and eloquent while playing his violin while being forceful and compelling in battle, and sticking to his guns despite certain opposition and small consequences that occur because of that decision.
Overall, Leadership, patriotism, and a true sense of responsibility and duty, all of which are desperately needed amongst a certain portion of the American people today, take center stage even away from Crowe's most commanding role to date. The most astonishing thing Peter Weir and his follow filmmakers have been able to do, besides elegantly and tastefully poking fun at the French, is to create a story that is slow and lumbering at times but not so much so that it results in a boring and lusterless feature, in fact Master & Commander is quite the opposite. It successfully keeps the audience members at the edge of their seats not only for the action occurring on screen but by keeping them in utter anticipation of events yet to unfold in the film as well. A beautifully mastered musical score, created by Christopher Gordon, Iva Davies and Richard Tognetti, keeps the historical time period in the context of the occurring actions in slower portions of the film while still engaging the audience with a rousing complement to the battle sequences. But the film's most powerful quality is its message of enduring leadership and dedication to one's country despite nearly impossible odds and the cost of friendship and life appearing to be worth more then the end result. The United States faces that exact challenge today but as the Jack Aubrey discovers, there is no more important value in life then a devotion to one's country and the commanding leadership that drives not only the crew but the heart and soul of one's country as well.",1082592000,6,5790,4.915219611848825

It's a nice balance of action-packed battle scenes where the British HMS Surprise engages the French privateer, the Acheron, at sea, and character development, between Cpt Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.  I'm already a huge fan of Patrick O'Brien's Master and Commander series of books, and this movie does a good job of capturing the essence of the books - specifically, the day-to-day realities of life aboard a Nelsonian warship, and the sights, smells and sounds of life at sea.  (Thankfully, the smells are left to the imagination.)
DVD Disc 2 is also a delight.  The ""Hundred Days"" portion captures the making of Master and Commander, from designing and building a replica of the HMS Rose, to challenges in casting, cinematography, and acting.  I particularly enjoy the commentary from lesser known cast and crew on what the experience means to them.  I recommend this movie to fans of O'Brien's series as well as to newcomers looking for a comfortably paced, historically-accurate movie experience.",1082592000,,1034,5.125

The warship attacks his ship in an excellent battle in the beginning of the film. After that Crowe is determined to stop it. Pail Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, A Knights Tale) is also fantastic as the ships doctor and Crowe's bestfriend. The ship battles are excellent and entertaining but there's not really a lot of that. There's a lot more dialogue and scenes where we get to know the crew of the ship. Bettany surprisingly makes a lot of this movie his own. He has great scenes with Crowe and also touching scenes with a boy on ship who he takes under his wing and teaches about animals and nature. Some people will think there's not enough action but it's still an excellent film. When there is action it's very good, the scenery is very nice, directing great and Bettany gives what should've been an oscar nominated performance.",1082592000,3,1036,4.7292817679558015

1864717,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander-The Far Side of the World is a fantastic movie in so many ways. There are so many things that make it great and the flaws are few.
In Master and Commander we have Captian ""Lucky Jack Aubrey. He has been given orders by the British empire to take down the French privateer Acheron. After a sneak attack by the French it's up to Jack to strike back. The ship needs repair and morale is low. He will also find himself torn between duty and friendship as he tries to fulfill his commands and stay true to himself.
Russel Crowe is the man. He is easily one of the greatest actors still in the business today. He plays Jack Aubrey to perfection. Russel Crowe lives the part and becomes the character and he does that in this movie. He is simply amazing and I love watching this guy on the big screen. In almost any other year Crowe probaly would have gotten an Oscar nomination for this performance. It is that good.
Paul Bettany is great as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He displays human emotions very well. It's a great character and he plays it very well. Like Crowe his performance is good enough for an academy nomination and in almost any other year and he would have gotten one.
Peter Weir has directed a cinematic masterpiece. Not since Steven Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan has a war movie had such detail put into it. Everything looks great in the film. The sets are real and authenic. The costumes are great. All the little details are great. They used real ships and filmed this in the tank that was made for Titanic. Mad props have to be given to Weir for the dedication and work he put into the film.
The one flaw that can be said about the movie is it is slow in places. The friendship between Aubrey and the Doctor does drag in places and they did go a little far with some of the character development. We don't need to learn as much as we did with some of the side characters. They don't do really do anything to enhance the plot of the movie at all.
One problem this movie had was the success of Pirates of the Carribean. Far to many people went to this film expecting to see something like  that. Instead of a comedy you get a pretty serious war-action-drama movie. The comedic points are low and most of them are based out of irony. Far to many people expected Pirates and knocked the film because of it.
The film was nominated for 10 academy awards. The two big ones were nominatons for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director."" It won for Best Sound and Best Cinematograpy. It's a pretty big statement when a movie gets this much academy attention. It would have won more if it hadn't been for Return of the King.
This is a great film. It's slow in places but is well worth it. It's a beautiful made movie and I'm glad I own it. It's enjoyable and I recommend it to all.",1082505600,,2796,4.325714285714286

My brother actually commented that you could almost ""smell the bilge"" whilst watching this movie, and I have to more than agree in it's attention to detail, and wonderful realism. The vast spectacle of it all is let down a little however by a fairly mediocre storyline, but despite this and a marginally annoying ending (let's leave the door open for a sequel) it is thoroughly enjoyable. Certain to be one of the DVD releases of the year there are some nice extra's on the 2nd disc, this collectors edition will run you around and extra $10, but the goodies are worth it, and the standard version has no special features at all. All of the performances are strong, and the power of the movie lies not only in it's breathtaking art direction, but also in the viewer being completely pulled in to the lives and actions of the main characters. Mild violence, and some graphic war scenes probably proclude this from a mainstream family audience, but otherwise it is a true sea faring ""ripping yarn"", full of high adventure, excitement, and plenty of swashbuckling thrown in.

1864721,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander...is the visceral visual embodiment of what naval war films and stories have always strived to achieve but have never been able to do:  capture the realities of 19th century naval life and warfare.  Based on a series of novels, Master and Commander is an amalgamation of several of the novels I am told.  It is my hope that we will see more films of a similar nature in the future.
I don't know who made this film - was it the Brits, the Aussies, or the Americans, but whoever did so, paid attention to detail (or kept to the source material's detail)? The great attention to detail leads me to believe it could not have been an American made film (we're notorious for throwing any reality out the window for the sake of a climactic scene or explosion).  What do I mean?
Watch any film old Hollywood or British film that covers 19th century seafaring subject matter (Billy Budd, Captain Blood, Mutiny on the Bounty, etc.) and you'll notice quickly that there are a large number of ""older"" actors present as the mates on the ships.  Now take a look at Master and Commander... You'll notice that there are fewer than 10% of the crew who are over the age of 30.  The fact of the matter was that people, in general, just didn't live terribly long at the time.  Throw in military service at sea and you can reduce the age limit even more.
Take a look at the midshipmen...""Ridiculous!"", you say.  They're portrayed as mere boys.  That's exactly what they were.  Boys were educated at home in the basics and then sent off to apprentice under a master in whatever trade they were expected to learn, be it blacksmiths, carpenters, accounts, etc.  In the case of the young boys in this movie, they are the 19th century equivalent of ""interns"" of ""management trainees"" to the officers in charge of the ship.  Midshipmen  came from well-to-do, or upper class, families of military heritage.  The boys of such officers were expected to take up the trade.  Lower classes could not hope to become officers in the military.  I have never before seen this accurately portrayed on film before.
The film is not too unlike Moby Dick in its singular, relentless plot:  Russell Crowe, as a British captain, is charged with finding the French frigate Acheron off the coast of Brazil.  He is to stop or destroy the ship.  The movie revolves around this singular plot.  You see, Crowe's ship is much smaller, less well equipped, slower, and more vulnerable than the French ship.
This is probably not a woman's movie.  There is no love interest in this film unless you think of the men pining for their wives or girlfriends who do not appear on screen.  Then there are the brief glimpses of native girls at one of the Brazilian islands where the ship gathers supplies.
That's it.  There's no hanky panky.  There's no sex.  There's no nudity.  In fact, I could only count one curse word, and that was only because I was watching the movie with subtitles on part of the time to understand some of the quick cockney dialogue.  Now, violence, there's plenty of it.  There's blood, but really there's no guts.  It's all blood of the the red Karo syrup variety and none of the oozing or spewing wound variety.  There are no great special effects awards to be won for best dismemberments or amputations or decapitations.  Frankly, it's a visceral movie, but nothing like most of the films out there.
Yes, the dialogue is machine gun fast and said with an ear for accuracy.  This means that unless you really understand the dialogue you're going to be lost.  Now, I watch the Britcoms all the time and I was lost.  That's why I turned on the subtitles.  It helped tremendously.
The film is very emotional and nerve racking.  Frankly, I was actually a bit disappointed with the ending.  I half expected it to continue.  It seems to set itself up for a sequel. Or not.  I just don't know.  It could be that I'm just expectant of a sequel in a society that automatically provides one when a film doesn't tie up every little loose end nice and tightly.
I highly recommend this film.",1082505600,2,4065,4.576177285318559
1864722,4,B00008W64E,"Those of us who have read the entire series of Patrick O'Brien's books on the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his dear friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin during the Napoleonic wars and have soaked up the atmosphere and sense of history so unfailingly captured in those books, are going to be hard to satisfy with any film representation. So although I have great respect for Peter Weir, I did not have high hopes as I sat down to watch the movie.
The opening scenes, of a darkened sea and a silent three-masted 'Surprise', with only night watch on deck and most hands asleep below, gives as true a sense of period as any I could possibly imagine - and captivated me immediately. The attention to detail is remarkable and the handling of the crew; surely one of the most difficult aspects of making such a film; utterly masterful. You can smell the lower deck with the hammocks tight-packed with sleeping, farting, snorting bodies and livestock penned into the same quarters. The battle scenes are stunningly effective and the impact of shot and ball makes you wince in a manner that you'd not think possible in an age where we constantly see violent action and are inured to the sight of exploding flesh. That you could not follow who was who in the melees - or determine quite how the various battles between ships were unfolding - didn't matter, because that is exactly how such actions are in reality. Who knows how many died by friendly fire in the confusion of those hand-to-hand encounters? The percentage must have been sizable, as it is even today.
Russel Crowe's performance as the utterly resolute and masterful sailor, 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, is truly brilliant. His English accent falters little and he gives the role all the subtlety required of a character whose own subtlety is not immediately evident. Aubrey is a commander who is intensely sensitive to the mood of his crew - knows all their names - and treats them with a rare humanity for the early 19th century Royal Navy. We know he acquired this sense, in part, because as a young midshipman, he was once demoted to the rank of common sailor; and in this experience, came to understand them as few officers could.
The disappointment, for me, was in the lack of development of Dr. Maturin's character. In the books, Maturin (played here by Paul Bettany) is in a sense the main character and much of what happens is seen through his eyes. He is an immensely complex man, deeply learned, and with a quaint 18th century manner of speech which contains much Irish mannerism. ""You are to consider"" he will say, or ""I am persuaded that ..."". His turn-out for formal dining occasions is the subject of much affectionate amusement among the crew (for they take pride in him as 'their' learned physician, who cares deeply for his patients) - and vexation for his Commander; for he may appear at dinner in a heavily blood-stained jacket, unwashed for several days, or with his wig awry. He is also evidently a man whose apparent age ""might have been anything between twenty and sixty"" and he is small and ""ill-looking"". He and Jack are total opposites and it is the interplay between the two characters; the great affection they hold for one another, that is the spirit of the books. So I say that I was disappointed that Stephen was not better cast and his character was not more defined. I can however also say that those scenes where the two of them make music together do succeed, by the nature of the music chosen, in coming close to the spirit of the book. I should also emphasize that we cannot blame Paul Bettany for this; the problem lies in the casting and in character development (Paul Bettany looks too young and well-kempt for the part and is given little chance to 'be' Stephen).
So on the visual level this is a brilliant film and Crowe is most convincing in his role. Weir has performed a labour of love and has soaked himself in the period and the genre.
People who read the books, and say that they cannot get past the vast amount of technical detail, will find no relief in the film. O'Brien was uncompromising in his use of nautical terminology and indeed of period language - readers have to take the responsibility to inform themselves in order to appreciate the book and now, to some degree, viewers of this film have the same responsibility.",1082505600,219,4323,4.64490861618799

1864724,5,B00008W64E,"The creaking of a bow overhead and the thundering of cannons all around you, the senses are bombarded in a DVD which arrived this week.
Fox Home Entertainment's transfer of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is so vividly presented in both audio and video quality that the studio undoubtedly wanted viewers to feel as if they had taken to sea themselves for all of its 138-minute running length.
Based on the acclaimed novels of Patrick O'Brien and his hero Royal Navy Officer Jack Aubrey the plot concerns his Ahab-like obsessive quest to track down the French Privateer Archeron across the oceans of the world.
In command of H.M.S. Surprise the British ship seems an unsuitable match for their quarry. The enemy vessel has greater firepower and is seemingly impervious to cannons fired from Aubrey's battery. It becomes clear after the first engagement between the two that Aubrey  is going to have to rely on his wits to outwit his adversary.
Down the coast of South America, around the vicious Cape Horn and north to the Galapagos Islands the Captain stays doggedly on the tail of the Archeron, narrowly missing his own destruction until the final heart pounding confrontation.
Australian director Peter Weir holds no punches in his portrayal of life aboard an early nineteenth century warship and Russell Crowe along with his ""Beautiful Mind"" co-star Paul Bettany both give sterling performances as the Captain and his best friend Ships Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Simply put ""Master and Commander"" is a triumph of movie making and arguably one of the best movies to be put out by a major studio in recent years.
Similarly the DVD holds no punches presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio in a fine transfer. Color accuracy is excellent and edge halos have been eliminated.

1864725,4,B00008W64E,"This movie is really a great but also very bleak representation of what life as a colonial era sailor must have been like. Most movies portray pirates as having fun and partying but M&C shows a much more realistic perspective where the sailors faced dangerous seas and attacks from French and barbarian ships in the Atlantic.
 Captain Jack Aubrey is the captain of his ship along with his sidekick surgeon (played by Paul Bettany) and is sailing in the South Atlantic to track down an enemy warship sent out during the Napeleonistic wars in France. A lot of very bleak and sometimes depressing parts are where some of the children are also on board the ship, at the mercy of the seas and weather, plus possible attack by French naval forces.
 The movie is really good but sometimes drags on in some places. Some of the scenes are also dull and even depressing but that's what M&C is about: The realistic portrait of the dangers and isolation of 1800s navy duty, plus bravery, loyalty, and faith. It's not ""PIrates of the Carribean"" where it's all like slapstick battles.
 ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World"" is an excellent movie and I look forwards to getting this on DVD!! You should too!!",1082246400,,1205,4.647887323943662
1864726,4,B00008W64E,"See this opening credit.  Three big powers of Hollywood --  Miramax, Universal, and 20th Century Fox -- joined forces to produce ""Master and Commander,"" a thrilling adventure tale of HMS Surprise, led by Captain Jack Aubrey, set in 1805.  He is ordered to capture (or sink) the formidable emeny ship the Acheron, without any support from other ships.
The story, based on Patric O'Brien books, is simple.  Russell Crowe's Captain is determined to chase the Acheron, whatever it takes, and in the following two hours you see the fierce battles, and very brief, quiet time of peace.  Paul Bettany is doctor of the ship, and Captain's most trusted friend, and their friendship also plays the major part of the film.
But you want to know whether the battle scenes of the film deserve your time and money.  They do.  The authentic descriptions of the fighting on the sea in the 19th century, when good use of the wind and the cannonballs decided the winner, are presented with confidence and tact.  They are not bloody as the real ones perhaps, but the danger of being there is easily felt.
My complaint is the film's occasional lull (including the literal one), in which the onward action so far, suddenly without warning, changes to a different theme.  When you think a chase between the two ships is about to start, the scene switches to a big storm.  When you think the ship is heading south, nearing the icy continent, you find the ship had already changed its course, going north.  This quick change, with episodic mode, comes probably from the way of adaptation of the original books, which are too long to be put into film.
Russell Crowe (who put on weight for the role) is always good at playing this kind of character with machismo, and that's no surprise when he is so perfect, but more astonishing is Paul Bettany, who underwent the complete transformation from his past gangster No. 1 images to a thoroughly intelligent Dr. Maturin.  You recongnize in him no ""MC Chaucer"" he did ""Knight's Tale,"" and that is amazing.
Peter Weir's direction is assured and well-paced, but to some the film's pace looks too slow at first.  He does not hurry to show the excitement of the battles or storm, and that shows his unshaken confidence in the material.  In fact, ""Master and Commander"" is a good case of ""the images tell everything,"" and to watch it is like seeing a majectic battleship gliding gracefully on the ocean.

1864729,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander tells the story of Lucky Jack Aubrey and his journey to ""The Far Side of the World"".  Based upon the books by Patrick O'Brian it is a faithful rendering of O'Brians world to film.  O'Brian found solace in creating a world of characters that exsisted in the era in which he placed them.  While he admitted that his books were not plot driven his details of life in Nelson's navy were magnificent.
This film faithfully follows O'Brians idea.  The plot is basic but it is the nuances of everyday life at sea that make it a sight to behold.  The things that these ""iron men"" had to endure would make the heartiest modern person blanche.
For anyone that has read O'Brian I strongly suggest that they don't hesitate to see this film.  In it will be all their old favorite characters.  If you have not read O'Brian (shame on you) then this is a great visual treat.
As I said, the plot is basic, chasing a French ship (changed from an American ship in the book)but the sense of friendship and intricate details of naval life move the story forward.

It ranges from great battle scenes with the tang of salt spray to human drama. The primary plot involves a cat and mouse game, set in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars, between Captain Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) ship Surprise and his enemy a French ship Acheron. (...)along for the ride we experience sailing, sea tactics, and life on board a ship of this era. The apprenticeship approach to schooling officers during the Napoleonic era placed children on board fighting vessels. We even see a brief glimpse of a lesson in navigation Captain Aubrey is giving the young midshipmen. Life in harm's way as the sea becomes a battlefield spares neither young nor old. The crowding, stale food, and mental toll that are a fact of life on vessels that are at sea for long periods of time are graphically portrayed. The mood is lightened by the exhilaration of the hunt and moments of courage, kindness, and Aubrey's penchant for terrible puns, which fans of O'Brian's books will recognize.
Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), the side kick of this famous duo, provides a counterpoint to Aubrey's sense of duty. Through him we see medicine of the period grope its way toward the future. As an amateur naturalist, Dr. Maturin visits the Galapagos Islands much as Darwin would have during his famous trip on HMS Beagle 30 years after the 1805 date of the movie. In fact, Dr. Maturin's desire to visit the Islands becomes a source of conflict between himself and the single minded Aubrey.

I wasn't sure who was winning or, for the most part, what I was looking at.  If not for this chaotic, sub-par fight sequence, the movie would have received five stars from me.  True, a fight in a dark and dank ship would not be as clear and clear to watch as two knights on horses, but the way it was filmed took me out of the world of the film while I tried to make sense of what my eyes were telling me.
The rest of the movie, however, is of the highest calibre.  Russell Crowe turns in another wonderful performance as the captain, and the rest of the cast gives a wonderful feeling of being on a real ocean-going sea vessel.

1864743,5,B00008W64E,"I'm a former Naval Officer, and I've read the complete series of books through multiple times.  This film manages to capture the flavor of the books while adding a few twists of it's own.

The movie itself is a course in naval history.  Similar period works like the ""Bounty"" opted to almost ignore the complexities involved in operating a ship.  M&C hits you with a lot of them  at the same time, but credits you with enough intelligence to follow it.

No matter what you're looking at; the uniforms, the duties people performed, the tactics, the language, the ship and its fittings, or any other item on the screen, it is both historically accurate and in keeping with the spirit of the book series.  I've heard people complain about the film's depiction of the young midshipmen who acted as junior officers on the ship.  This is how it was, and again the film pulls no punches as to how demanding and brutally unfair this type of life could be.  Others have complained about the ""cheeziness"" of some of the spontaneous singing and instrument work in the movie.  But again I give the film credit for daring to highlight what was actually done for entertainment in those days, long before CD's & TV made music a passive, solitary, spectator event.

The only ""groaner"" point in the movie for me involved a bad pun referring to some unwanted vermin in the food.  In the books, Jack is relentlessly unquick when it comes to a play on words.  Yet he'll proudly refer back to the rare incidents years earlier when he actually ""got in a good one"".  In the book series, this adds another tone to the character; but in the movie it came off as a little forced.  Most people are completely unaware of the state of food supplies on a Napoleonic warship, and the movie could have provided an earlier reference to the presence of mold, maggots, weevils, and rats on the ship; and how these extra passengers were accepted matter-of-factly by the crew.

I was a little worried about Russel Crowe when I heard he was cast.  The Aubrey character from the books is a hulking, borderline fat, scarred up giant, and I had always pictured the man who played the British officer in ""Last of the Mohicans"" whenever I read the books.  But Crowe delivers again.  Bettany is perfect as Dr. Maturin (significant portions of this character are not revealed in the movie and remain a treat for those who read the books).  The only casting choice I had a problem with was Bonden (played by one of the Hobbit guys).  If I remember correctly from the books, Bonden was a prizefighter, not at all a match for the physicality of this actor. (If I've gotten this wrong please forgive me).

One final note is that this movie should have been nominated for, and should have won, an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  To comb through 20 books looking for which bits and peices could be brought together to make a viable, watchable movie, while still remaining true to the source material is an incredible task (the movie differs significantly from the 2 novels named in the title).  This movie pulled it off beautifully.  Even minor characters are given enough screen time to establish them firmly.  From Killick worrying about the silver and muttering under his breath, to ""Awkward"" Davies, a man more useful in a fist-fight than for anything involved with sailing a ship.

If you want historically accurate, informative, exciting, complex action, involving some of the most popular, relevant, and influential characters in historical fiction, than this movie is for you.  I highly recommend it.",1081468800,10,3561,4.718446601941747
1864744,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander was a wonderful film, one of the best of the year.  It captured many of the things that make Patrick's O'Brian's books stand head and shoulder above others of the type -- the music, the natural world, the real feel of the ship. It skimps a bit on the character of Dr. Maturin, but does a very good job with Aubrey.
But ...  why, when the two-disc version of most movies -- complete with deleted scenes, making of specials, etc. -- are the standard, are they charging a premium for the two-disc version of Master and Commander (with a cheaper addition for those who just want the movie).  It's not like the Lord of the Rings films:  the special edition is not a four-disk extended edition. It's the same sort of two-disk set that we've come to expect for under $20 for most films.

The Aussie director of classics such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli,Year of Living Dangerously,Dead Poet's Society and the underrated Truman Show returns with force after five years absence (Truman being his last in '98) with a powerful film that will engage you in its clever dialog and dazzle you with its well edited action, Master and Commander: the Far Side of The World.
Based on a novel by Patrick O'Brien and a screenplay by Weir himself, it is the cat and mouse chase in the Pacific ocean during Napoleonic times, between a British ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey and a much stronger French vessel.
The success of the film in my opinion lies firmly with the screenplay, and the well written characters that perfectly reflect their time and environment. In a short time, the viewer will find him/herself totally immersed in their individual stories, and will sympathize with their condition, be saddened by their losses and cheer their successes..
I found myself transfixed at the anecdotes at the captain's dinner table about Lord Nelson, touched by the heroism of the little boy, amused by the grumpiness of the steward Killick, and bemused by the sailors superstitions.
And this is not easily achieved but shows that Weir indeed possesses a great talent for writing that equals his visual sensitivities.
The action scenes, safe to say are very well directed and (equally important edited as well). I liked the fact the French vessel remains up until the end of the film, elusive and 'ghost like', as the whole film is seen exclusively through the 'eyes' and point of view of the British ship.
The scenery is quite impressive, especially the ones filmed in the Galapagos islands.
Now the acting,
I don't if anyone could have played Aubrey's part better than Russell Crowe! He simply plays the part to perfection, and you can clearly tell that he was very much at ease in this role, while all the other actors (mainly British) give brilliant performances that complement Crowe's lead role and Weir's masterful direction, especially Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy and David Threlfall.
The world of cinema is full of good directors as well as mediocre and bad ones, but only a handful can be considered artists in the truest sense of this word, (especially these days) and Peter Weir is certainly one. You have to see Master and Commander..to know what I mean and to applaud one helluva comeback!",1081123200,,2512,4.912941176470588
1864746,3,B00008W64E,"nice movie, well shot, well acted.  some parts were cheesy, many scenes involving crowe and his dialogue made you chuckle.  and when he whipped out his violin and started playing classical, a bit over the top to portray him as a gentleman.
overall, it is worth it to watch, but not to buy.  even if this dvd is jammed packed with extras, commentaries, deleted scenes, and alternative endings i would save your $20 and buy something else.",1080864000,,437,4.64935064935065
1864747,3,B00008W64E,"....SERIOIUSLY. Take a few minutes and think about this before rejecting it as a silly intepretation. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is extremely similar to Captain Kirk in both appearance and temperment...you know the beloved-by-the-crew even though he's tough  guy, who tends to act impulsively but manages to triumph over seemingly impossible odds, over and over. Dr. Maturin (Paul Bettany) is a sort of combo of Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy -- the brilliant humanitarian and almost miraculously gifted physician PLUS natural scientist and curious-seeker whose personality is constantly being contrasted against the Captains. Add a ""salty"" crew of unremarkable sailors -- seemingly there for the sole duty of being bumped off and then quickly forgotten. Oh and let's not forget a stalwart ship with plenty of personality...
It may sound near to impossible, but keep in mind that the Aubrey-Maturin series BEGAN in 1970, after Star Trek had finished it's three year run as a TV show. There was plenty of Horatio Hornblower adapted into Star Trek, so it's probably ""turnabout as fair play"" to see a historical writer -- otherwise consumed with accurate historical detail -- who was so heavily influenced by popular culture!
While watching this film, I couldn't get this concept out of my head as the dialogue and situations just kept reminding me of Star Trek over and over again. However, I want to be perfectly fair to the movie -- it's highly enjoyable with superb special effects that make the ship and it's isolation out in the ocean very convincing. The depiction of the really tough, dirty, cramped conditions that the sailors live in is also done in an outstanding manner. Battle scenes, etc. are all superbly staged and photographed.
The weaknesses largely come from the problem of combining TWO of Patrick O'Brien's excellent seafaring books into one film. Why? Wasn't ONE enough? And then changing the historical details, such as having the enemy vessel be FRENCH (yeah, I guess we are still busy getting even with France) instead of American. I guess the filmmakers couldn't concieve of an US audience accepting an American ship being defeated by a British one! even with the historical reality that Britain ruled the seas at this time.
Crowe and Bettany turn in fine performances, even if channeling old Star Trek characters, and young actor Max Pirkis does a outstanding job as a adolescent sailor who loses and arm and becomes an important addition to the crew. Although the presence of so many very tender looking young boys brings up the ugly question of sexual abuse under this kind of isolated circumstance -- something that was a reality in the British Navy at the time -- and it's completely glossed over here. The boys are treated with real fatherliness by Captain Aubrey, which is very charming but probably totally unrealistic.
If you enjoyed the PBS series Horatio Hornblower, or really any old movie that dealt with period sailing ships and the seafaring life, this movie will appeal to you. It was by far one of the most memorable films of 2003, and I think only missed winning awards because of heavy competition from LOTR.",1080691200,5,3144,4.988571428571428

Unlike that reviewer perhaps I HAVE actually read the series, and most battles are against the French, with occasional excursions, as in ""The Ionian Mission"" against the Turks (after a long blockade of the French incidentally).
At first I was annoyed that they had changed the foe in this one from US to France, but then I realised that in some ways this book is an adaptation of elements of the entire series rather than one book. The skull operation occurs in one book, the doctor operating on himself in another, and so on. Whoever adapted this script clearly HAS read all 20 books.
Marvellous fim, and in its apparent nonlinear plot, every like O'Brien's books.

The impressive special effects and spectacular battles do not overshadow the characters and human drama.  Various crew members are presented efficiently and well acted so that we feel that they are not merely fodder to be blown up for our entertainment but living, breathing people that we hope will survive the violence-though not all of them do.

The close quarters of the film when on board make you feel a little heavy. There was not much room below decks or even above when all the men were aboard.
The interesting scenes between the commander and his men, the interplay of crew and officers and the battle scenes will draw you in if you let them.
Having toured empty tall ships, this was enlightening to see how cramped quarters they had.  The movie will take you on a journey with the crew, making decisions that seem at times to contradict what was promised just before.  But for duty and honour....

So, why the switch?  In the 20 set collection, most of the naval battles are between America and the British around 1810-1815.  The books have very little to do with France.

If you are a fan of the novels, as I am, you will likely be dissatisfied with the movie, not because it isn't a great film, which it is, but because it does a SEVERE lack of justice to the books.  And it's additionally annoying because Peter Weir got the hard stuff right, and the easy stuff wrong.  Russell Crowe was as perfect as probably possible for Jack Aubrey, but Paul Bettany was jaw-droppingly, unbelieveably wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Because of that, the script also had to be all wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Maturin is supposed to be tiny, dark, and ugly--he is half Irish and half Catalan Spanish.  He is physically uncoordinated and has a rather sour secretive disposition, with a tendency toward depression.  Because of the latter he is a drug addict.  But he is a fantastically erudite physician and polyglot, and a very successful spy for the British government.  The Patrick O'Brian books are just as much about the spying adventures of Maturin as they are about the sailing adventures of Aubrey, but because Paul Bettany could not possibly be convincing as anything more than a physician who doesn't know much about ships, half of what's good about the books had to be excised.  That is unfortunate, because the two characters have their own strengths and weaknesses and complement each other perfectly.  Read the books--they are far better.  And I guess we'll just have to wait for the BBC to do a series of movies a la Horatio Hornblower before anything like justice gets done to the books on film.",1078272000,13,1626,4.706713780918728

Directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, Master and Commander examines life aboard a British warship during the Napoleonic Wars as it encounters and is battered by a French privateer, the Acheron, and then pursues its enemy from the coast of Brazil southward around Cape Horn to The Galapagos Island until the final, inevitable and decisive encounter. The acting is first-rate, beginning with Crowe but including Paul Bettany (who previously appeared with Crowe in A Perfect Mind) as ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin, and Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney, one of several midshipmen aboard H.M.S. Surprise. Weir brilliantly juxtaposes violent battle scenes at sea with quiet, at times tender moments aboard ship. There is also a fascinating sequence during which Dr. Maturin and two youthful companions leave the ship to gather scientific specimens until unexpectedly....
The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, receiving one (Russell Boyd for cinematography). Given the competition, it probably did not deserve others but suggesting that in no way damns with faint praise. (Praises with faint damnation?) This is a delightful, stirring, and on occasion moving account of a charming and resourceful captain and his loyal crew who, when necessary, summon exceptional courage with style and grace. I was surprised to learn how self-sufficient such ships must be, especially in terms of repairing damage resulting from combat. Because all of the film is set aboard the British warship, I also realized how confining, if not claustrophobic it must have seemed at times to crew members. On occasion, I did have a problem catching some of the dialogue but that may be more indicative of my hearing ability (or loss thereof) than of the quality of the soundtrack.

1864771,5,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,"" directed by Peter Weir, tells the rousing story of HMS Surprise, an English warship sailing around South America during the Napoleonic era.  The ship's captain (played by Russell Crowe) engages in a battle of wits, wills, and firepower with a rival captain during the perilous sea trek.
This is a vivid, exciting tale of naval warfare, but it's also a satisfying and moving portrayal of a unique community: the company of a warship.  The film is full of stirring action scenes, but it is equally rich in the details of the men's everyday life: their food, shipboard entertainment, naval tradition, etc.  It's a sweaty, muscular portrait that really puts you in the midst of this fascinating world.
Weir gets superb performances from the large ensemble cast.  Crowe won my heart as the captain: he portrays a man who is tough and witty, but also humane and reasonable.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, both a loyal friend and verbal sparring partner for the captain; it's a marvelously realized relationship.  The rest of the cast rises to the high mark set by these excellent performers; Max Pirkis in particular shines as a courageous young midshipman.
There are some intense scenes of violence and combat surgery.  But this material is not gratuitous, and is handled with care by Weir, who never loses sight of his characters' humanity.  And the film is also about much more than war; it's also about exploring a distant land and seeing wondrous sights.  There are nice moments of humor to balance out the film's serious themes of military discipline, ethics and tactics.  Overall, M&C is a rousing adventure story, told with heart.

The excitement and action are tempered with an attempt to portray the horror and butchery of 19th century naval warfare in a fairly realistic manner. When solid shot hits the ship, splinters rain death and destruction on everyone nearby. No one looks clean or pretty after any of the battle scenes.
What sets this action film apart from most action pictures in recent years is it has a script! Action scenes are brief and exciting, but the real story comes from the character development and respectably written dialog. The friendship between the ship's surgeon and the captain as well as that between the surgeon and a very young officer are well developed and draw you into the story so that you do care what happens to these characters. You'll want to sing Rule Britannia when the crew goes into combat in the final battle scene of the film!
The film balances the excitement and romance of The Age of Sail nicely with its more unpleasant features, like bug-ridden biscuits, water shortages and the terrors of combat and being lost at sea, all while creating memorable characters. Tension and suspense are created in numerous ways, not just through mindless action sequences as in some films.

4+ stars - Great Big Screen Movie
4- stars - when it hits DVD
Summary:
A screen adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's fictional chronicles of the early 19th century British-French naval wars.  This film focuses on the friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey and surgeon Stephen Maturin and the evolution of their relationship as they face a superior foe.
Review:
A good naval yarn, and excellent big screen film.  Maybe not a movie you will see 3-4 times, but, certainly a movie you will see twice..... once at the theatre (highly recommended) and once (1 time) again when the DVD comes out (for the Directors' Commentary - my plan anyhow).
Good script writing, great cinematography, great acting, great sets, great props and costumes, wonderful music.
The realism of the sets including the ships, the ocean cinematography, and the cat & mouse naval conflict makes this a big screen must see.  The ship is a real replica 1800s-era British tall ship (Rose - from Rhode Island).  The big screen viewer is truly transported to another time.
Unfortunately, the action and dialog doesn't make you crave watching and dissecting the film a half dozen times like other big screen action films.  It is accurate fictional history.  But, it lacks the expected excitement, quick and brilliant dialogue or deeper spiritual essence that initiates deep thought and repeated viewing.

Regardless, ""Master & Commander: Far Side of the World"" is a must see for the big screen!",1076803200,2,1453,5.004149377593361
1864789,5,B00008W64E,"In addition to the treat of seeing Russell Crowe in any role, this movie's story of valiant fighting men in an earlier era was done superbly by Weir.  One felt as if transported to the early 19th century, and marveled at the conditions our forebearers endured with such gusto.  It's a rousing tale told by a ""master"" story-teller (Patrick O'Brian), whose books are fascinating.  Anyone who loves adventure, the sea, historical tales and Russell Crowe will love this one.",1076803200,4,470,4.924050632911392
1864790,3,B00008W64E,"I came to 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' with little expectations beyond reasonable entertainment.  I was thus surprised that this was a powerful little human drama about a vicious chase in the high seas.
What makes 'Master and Commander' successful is not the plot, which is a straightforward cat and mouse story.  Rather, it succeeds because of its gritty sense of realism and the ability to capture the feel of time and place.
While most historical movies feature ordinary, contemporary people in period dress (see 'Gangs of New York'), Master and Commander does feel like it takes place in the early 19th century.  It is little things, like Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) motivating his troops by demanding ""Do you want your children to sing 'La Marseillaise'?"", or the real excitement the characters display in discussing Nelson.
Also powerful is the film's feel for the hardships of warfare on the Sea.  Early in the film, a child loses his arm, and throughout the movie real characters suffer casual death.  At one point Jack Aubrey must choose between saving one man and saving his crew, and he allows the man to drown.  This form of realism is so rare in Hollywood films, in makes 'Master and Commander' truly unique.
The great weakness of the film is its episodic nature.  There is scarcely a plot - the hunt for the French frigate ""Acheron"" is merely a framework for the individual happenings, which include a storm, a suicide, and most infamously, a rather overlong subplot about Crowe's sidekick's (Paul Bettany) Darwin-like expedition to Galapagos Islands.
Indeed, the emergence of this subplot makes the second half of the film slow and much less interesting then the first half. Although the scenery is breathtaking, the story just fails to move, until Bettany's accidental discovery of the Acheron, which sets the stage for the climatic battle.
Director Peter Weir and his crew should be commanded for a great adaptation of Patrick O'Brien's seafaring adventure.  If there will be a sequel, I will go with high expectations.",1076803200,112,2065,4.982558139534884
1864791,4,B00008W64E,"First things first - as movies go, this is pretty good. It has an engaging storyline (Capt. Jack Aubrey of the HMS Surprise having to hunt down the French privateer Acheron during the Napoleonic wars), stunning visuals (the entire movie is shot on board the Surprise except for a few shots of the Galapagos), accurate recreation of the setting it portrays (the overcrowding, squalor, hierarchy & occasional savagery of naval life at the time is starkly visible) and contains enough human drama to provide emotional appeal (the characters of the captain and his best friend, who also happens to be the ship's doctor, are well fleshed out, as are a couple more). Fans of Patrick O'Brien's novels seem reasonably happy with the translation of his works onto the big screen, and newcomers are given enough background to be able to understand things from the get-go.
However, the movie suffers from a strange condition that is impossible to remedy. Ironically for a movie that can claim descent from high-seas swashbucklers of yesteryear, it moves at an excrutiatingly slow pace. This is a natural consequence of the remarkably high level of detail provided by the accuracy & scale of the sets and the scenes of everyday life on board the vessel, and those who really get into the mood of the movie may appreciate the slowness, but a casual watcher can get quite easily turned off by it. In contrast, the battle scenes are furiously paced, with astounding CGI work that can have you ducking in your seat. This gives the movie a very choppy feel, almost like an orator who rattles off his sentences really fast, but pauses inordinately often and for too much time between sentences.
The acting is engaging - Russel Crowe is good, Paul Bettany is excellent, and some of the younger members of the cast have delivered memorable, if short, performances. The dialogue is pithy - rather melodramatic at times, but quite effective as a reflection of that day and age. The director gives you thoughtful glimpses into some of the everyday joys, fears, hopes & superstitions of the crew of the ship - the way they react to the presence of a so-called ""Jonah"" on board, their unquestioning loyalty to their captain, their ultimate dedication to the ship & the admiration of Lord Nelson that characterised almost every sailor of the day.
O'Brian fans will undoubtedly enjoy this movie to the hilt - my suggestion is that you get the special extended edition DVD for your viewing pleasure. Casual watchers... if you're expecting a breakneck speed chase story on water, you'll be disappointed. This is a movie that has one purpose - to accurately show you life on board a naval vessel in the early 1800s, adding some action and drama along the way. Cruel as it may be to say this, the fact that it succeeds is something that most people won't appreciate too much - by the time they ACCEPT this purpose, most of the movie would have passed by with them fidgeting in their seats.",1076630400,3,2958,4.779296875
1864792,5,B00008W64E,"In a world of look-a-like movies, ""Master and Commander"" stands strongly apart from the rest. While the temptation would be for the filmmakers to take this to the nautical lows of ""A Perfect Storm"" in an action-ocean-war flick, they made it into a true character movie with remarkable moments of drama, tension, and yes, action.
The true stars of ""Master and Commander"" are Russell Crowe (Captain Aubrey) and Paul Bettany (Dr. Maturin). I've loved Bettany in everything he's done - he adds this comfortable tenor to all his films, and in this case he really balances out Crowe's stern Aubrey. We are in 1805, and the film takes place almost entirely at sea, yet never gets boring due to the great character development with Aubrey and Maturin in a classic protagonist/antagonist setup. Aubrey is obsessed with his ship and his mission, to hunt down the French ship Archeron. Its captain, however, is an even match for Aubrey and consistently outwits him.
This game of cat and mouse ensues for most of the film, but is nicely counterbalanced by Dr. Maturin, a naturalist, who discovers several new species on the Galapagos Islands using only a telescope as they flank the archipelago. This leads to his insistence that they land there so he can explore further, causing great scenes of tension between the two men.
This movie has pretty much everything, though I could see some people feeling it's a little drawn out during the parts of island exploration by Maturin. What you initially think is going to be just a little dip in the storyline quickly turns into one of the major subplots in the film. The historical aspects are excellent, including the unusual addition of all the young boys onboard the ship - a common practice in that time but rarely included in films. In fact, the performance by the lead child - I didn't catch his name - was one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Rent if you must, but this seems like one you should own.",1076544000,3,1950,4.721407624633431
1864793,5,B00008W64E,"I've never read a book by Patrick O'Brien featuring captain Lucky Jack Aubrey, so everything on ""Master and Commander"" was new to me. First of all, Peter Weir proved to be a very intelligent director, making the viewers totally at ease and making me feel I was part of Aubrey's crew. Sometimes it seemed I was on the deck of HMS Surprise.
Second, though the story is not original and really showed no surprises (no pun intended), the screenplay is very good. At first sight, a 130-minute movie that goes on pratically only aboard a ship seems dull and boring. But the scenes are always significant to the context of the film, and the screenplay provides interesting insights on the characters' personalities, not only the two main characters (Jack Aubrey and the Doctor Maturin) but minor ones as well. I think the children's and teenagers' acting was great. The battle scenes are impressive, and the quiet and sometimes funny scenes on Galapagos Islands proved to be a nice interlude.
Surprisingly, Russel Crowe is not in his acclaimed usual macho-style as in ""Gladatior"" and ""Proof of life"". He plays Jack Aubrey as a commanding but sensitive man (his musical scenes with the doctor are great - in fact the music in the movie is very good and appropriate). But the one who steals every scene he's in is the real-life Lucky (his wife is Jennifer Connelly) Paul Bettany as Dr. Stephen Maturin.
""Master and commander"" is not only a nicely-executed film, but also great entertainment as well.

1864794,5,B00008W64E,"As an educator and naval historian, I found ""Master and Commander""to be honest and thrilling history. It showed that there was nothing romantic about life at sea. The world of the average seaman was hard, dirty and dangerous. The movie also did a good job of showing the society and values of the era. Another aspect of the movie, that I felt was important to show, was the medical ""tools"" and their use. The weevils in the food also added realism to the story. Overall, I found the movie did a great job showing the various aspects of life at sea----battle, living in close quarters, religion and superstition, class society, discipline, etc. Lastly, I thought that showing the cultured side of a warrior such as Aubrey was also important. Japanese admiral Yamamoto, for example, liked to photograph flowers! We all have our many sides and facets. As far as I could tell, this movie had it all! A must see.",1076198400,5,907,4.675
1864795,4,B00008W64E,"""Master & Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" on the technical aspect is the only opponent for ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" in the awards season. The level of detail that this movie presents is fantastic: the photography allows to see even the slightest detail of the ships used in this film. The cannonballs are so real that once in a while you might feel the need of dodging them. Russell Boyd, the cinematographer of ""Master & Commander"" did a great job, specially capturing on-screen the natural beauties of the Galapagos Islands and the vastness of the sea.
However, the biggest problem in ""Master & Commander"" are the first 50 minutes of the movie. Requires patience because the rhythm it's kinda slow, so the audiences that like movies with the pace of a video-game (explosions every 5 minutes, MTV fast editing) should consider before watching this movie.
For the rest of us that enjoy the development of a plot (even if the pace is slow), the final 80 minutes of the movie are the reward: the film becomes very interesting, the action scenes are incredible, the battles are very realistic, the characters become multidimensional persons, and the plot gets better and better every minute.
On the technical aspect ""Master & Commander"" is excellent, but the performances are good. Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey is very good as usual, but Paul Bettany is outstanding in the role of Dr. Stephen Maturin, the best friend of the captain (perhaps Paul Bettany should have been nominated for best supporting actor). And a very pleasant surprise is the youngster Max Pirkis, as the charismatic Lord Blackeney, a kid that will win the sympathy of the audiences.
""Master & Commander"" is a very interesting movie, a visual and sound feast. The sound effects are astonishing, the music is great (featuring music from Beethoven and Mozart). After the opening 50 minutes, the story gets better every minute.",1076198400,3,1928,4.8810975609756095
1864796,2,B00008W64E,"The story basically is Aubrey chasing around in the southern part of the hemisphere after a French man'o'war.....that is it...
I found it (extremely)tedious and annoying.
One of the most distracting part of it was the noise.
The dialogue was often drowned in it.....
Frankly I think Weir should have spent a bit more time on character development........
If you think that this film is exciting, then you probably would love watching grass grow.......",1076112000,,451,5.108108108108108
1864797,4,B00008W64E,"Yes, that's what this movie looked like at the outset. It's 1805--Trafalgar Year! When Master and Commander Russell Crowe is at dinner with his officers, one of them musters up the courage to ask him, ""Sir have you ever met the Admiral?"" We are then treated to Crowe's reverential view of Horatio Lord Nelson. Then, after a nasty battle, a young lad has had to have his arm amputated. M&C Crowe visits the lad whilst recuperating. He is moved to see what's happened to this little tyke, and says something to the effect of, ""Well, here's something you can read in the meantime!"" and out comes a life story of Nelson. And, in case some in the audience are light on their Nelson lore, the first few pages of the book are turned to show Nelson with his empty sleeve pinned up--he's an amputee, just like Our Brave Lad. The Lad looks up at M&C Crowe and puts it to him: ""What's he like, sir?"" Yet Our Man can give no answer, but just moves away.
Well, having been prepared with these Nelsonic emblems, I thought I could predict a thing or two about this movie. The mission of the ship is to track down a French vessel in the Western Hemisphere and stop/sink her. But just a few minutes into the flick comes that sea battle mentioned above that seriously cripples M&C's ship. Everyone's for going back to refit, except--most importantly of course--M&C. He says, I've got my orders and that's it. I, TutorGal, then waited to hear him express WHY this had to be, because of all the Nelson stuff earlier. I mean, it just hung there in the air waiting to be verbalized: BECAUSE ENGLAND EXPECTS THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD DO HIS DUTY. Those are the most famous words of Lord Nelson, you see. Interestingly enough, though, not a peep about this. Now of course, one could argue that the saying comes from the Battle of Trafalgar, which hadn't happened yet in this movie, and you'd be right. But couldn't M&C have said, since he seems really into Nelson, something like, ""Every time I ever heard him, he commented on how important it was to do your duty."" Not the real famous quote, but something that would suggest that Nelson communicated how essential he found this value to the young M&C.
I also have since learned that this movie is based on a rather well-known and loved book series. This explains something which had baffled me during the movie, precisely: why was I supposed to be into the ship's doctor's scene? He and M&C are always exchanging ""meaningful glances"" which if you hadn't read these books (like me) you might interpret as ""these guys have something going on the side"". Actually, it's that they are the best of friends--soulmates but just of the same gender. But herein also must have been a disappointment for those who had come to the theatre because of having loved the books. At one point, M&C is trying to figure out how come these French guys are always able to psych out the English ship's position. Doctor replies, The French navy has their spies, as do we. Then, another of those ""glances"". What was that about? Even if you were a spy on the English ship, well, what were you going to do with this purloined information--toss it overboard in a bottle? But evidentally, the ship's doctor--in the books--is himself a spy, of all things. But since nothing else was made of this, it was a line that was just there as a table scrap to book readers.
After a while, Sea Literature 101 starts to loom on the horizon. There's some junior officer who always seems to have bad luck on his watch and others begin to grumble that he's...Jonah! Uh oh, know what you have to do with a Jonah, don't you? Then remember, M&C won't listen to reason about turning back. Doctor tried to get through to him. He seems as obsessed as if he were hunting down...a white whale! Well, metaphorically at least. And then, of all things, what starts flying around just above the deck? Did you guess it already? Did you? An...albatross! And some stupid guy gets out a gun and then...calamity!!! Which leads to the most outlandish operation scene I've ever seen in any movie, period. I don't want to spoil it entirely, but let's just say there are some things you just can't do yourself, and abdominal surgery is one of them.
Now, lest you think that this movie ought to be beached, not the case at all!! Actually, it has a lot going for it. Russell Crowe makes for a nice captain--none of that Bligh stuff on this boat. The little kid is quite scrappy and likeable, as are most of the crew. There is a sense of real exhilaration when M&C puts his boot up on the side of his ship and sails along with his ponytail in the wind. And when there's a battle scene, they go for it! So I liked this movie in spite of my scribblings above.
It's a good movie in many respects, but it just seems to be lacking something, which is I expect something from the books themselves. Hence, four not five stars.",1075939200,,4873,4.488738738738738

The film did not capture that relationship.  Nor was Maturin well cast or developed.  Russel Crowe did a creditable job of portraying one aspect of Aubrey, the competitive hunter and naval officer, though the character was a bit muted, possibly because the script did not provide for enough scope.  The principal sin:  The film tried to cover too much material in too little time.  The result was a hurried and sometimes chaotic story line, and key elements lost.",1075593600,,700,5.043478260869565

The opening action sequence was more realistic than most I have seen and the could never gain the upper hand. However, I was expecting more of an action flick than a plot filled movie that kept you interested. The previews showed it as a constant battle, but it was a struggle against nature that they showed.

1864809,3,B00008W64E,"I want to talk about ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World."" I thought would like this movie because:
a)It got so many good reviews and usually that is a sign that it is a good movie.
b)Russell Crowe usually picks good movies(Remember ""A Beautiful Mind.""
I really enjoyed how this movie made you feel that you were actually on a boat. The preformanceswere also great. Russell Crowe could be nominated for an Oscar. The problem with this movie was that it was a little dull. The movie is about two and a half hours, and I felt that some of the scenes could have been deleted from the movie. I felt the same way and I stated that in my review for ""Cold Mountain."" I also gave that three stars for the exact same reasons. Both of these movies wee good but had scenes that were useless. I also didn't feel that the plot for this movie came early enough. The storyline started pretty late in the movie. This movie also ends it as if there is defintly going to be a sequal. They probally will because it made alot of money already, and because it is based on a seris of books. There is more to the story then this.
The story is about Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany as Captain Jack and Dr. Stephan Maturin. It takes places in April of 1805 and the only thing that stands between Napoleon and the world is the British Army. Jack is ordered to take his warship and intercept the French. But the French have caught up to Jack's boat and after a brutal attack, Jack's boat escapes into the fogbank. Jack's choice to fix the boat at sea instead of going to a port does not feel right to his right hand man, friend, and doctor to the boat Stephan Maturin. As Jack continues to follow the French boat, they try to avoid more attacks, and they push the crew and the young men on the boat to their limits. But Jack becomes determined to catch the French to the point where Maturin begins to question his professional choices, and if they are the right ones or not.
I wrote a review for ""Master and Commander,"" when I first saw it a few months ago but it didn't make it to amazon. So I decided to rewrite it and try to explain more what could have made the film worked. Like I said above, the movie made you feel that you were really on a ship. But some of the scenes also were not needed. Take the scene where Maturin gets shot, and preforms the operation on himself. I liked that scene, but it didn't fit in to the story. It was a good movie, but I was very hopeful that it would be a great movie. Mixed reviews for this one. Should have waited for the video. A must-see for the home.
ENJOY!

1864810,5,B00008W64E,"This isn't quite an updating of MOBY DICK.  It lacks the metaphysical and religious elements, but just as Ahab is pursing his white whale, so does Capt. ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey pursue the French fighting ship Acheron, which is larger, better gunned, and faster than his own H.M.S. Surprise.  This is not a deep movie.  It is not, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, a morality tale.  It is simply an adventure yarn, but as such, it is one of the most satisfying I have seen in a long while.  The movie stars Russell Crowe as Aubrey, and while this isn't one of the more challenging roles he has played, he did his usual stellar job.  Paul Bettany has the second lead as Aubrey's close friend, classical music partner, and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The rest of the cast (including Billy Boyd who I saw earlier today as Pippin in RETURN OF THE KING) is uniformly excellent and makes a fine ensemble cast.  There is one other costar, and that is the ship used to portray the H.M.S. Surprise.  They really went all out in making a perfect recreation of a late 18th century frigate.  I kept thinking about the gigantic number of ropes that seemed to be required to make the ship functional.
This is a chase movie.  There is little or no preface and build up to the action.  We are immediately told that the assignment for the Surprise is to find and capture or sink the French ship the Acheron.  The rest of the film consists either the two ships engaging one another, or the Surprise chasing the Acheron.  The substance of the film beyond that consists entirely of the relations between the various members of the crew, with the exception of a trip to the Galapagos Islands, where Maturin, as a naturalist, gets to glimpse the animals that Charles Darwin would make so much of only a couple of decades later on the Beagle.  Apart from some TV documentaries, this is the only movie I can ever remember having seen that was actually shot on location in the Galapagos Islands, and it was, moreover, the only parts of the film shot on dry land.
Some serious film buffs might turn their noses up at this film, because it doesn't try to do anything but entertain, but it does that so well, that I would suggest that they think about nose jobs.",1074384000,8,2228,4.48019801980198
1864811,3,B00008W64E,"***1/2 The odd thing about ""Master and Commander"" is that its strengths and its weaknesses both seem to derive from one and the same source: its subtlety.
Based on the novels by Patrick O'Brian, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is a seafaring adventure tale more notable, perhaps, for its straight-ahead action sequences than for its finer elements of characterization and conflict.  O'Brian has certainly given writer John Collee and writer/director Peter Weir plenty to work with here, starting with an Ahab-type main character named Jack Aubrey, a British sea captain in 1805 who becomes obsessed with overtaking and attacking a much larger French man-of-war ship that defeated his vessel in battle off the coast of South America.  Aubrey, albeit a man of sensibility and compassion, often endangers the lives of his men in an effort to complete his ""mission,"" even though he is routinely challenged by cooler heads on the ship to acknowledge the fruitlessness of the endeavor and to set sail for home an honorably defeated man.
Aubrey is nowhere near as neurotic and delusional as Ahab, and that perhaps is the biggest problem with the film.  Aubrey, for all his bluster, is really not all that interesting a character.  Although we can see where the filmmakers are trying to take us, they never seem able to crack open Aubrey's mind to help us get inside and learn what really makes him tick.  One thing about Ahab is that we always knew why the stakes were so personal for him.  With Aubrey we don't really understand why he is so single-mindedly set on getting his target.  Perhaps the confrontations he has with his crewmen are just a trifle too low-keyed and underplayed to reveal very much about his character.  ""Master and Commander"" may be a more realistic yarn than ""Moby Dick"" but, in this case at least, subtlety comes with a hefty price.  An adventure film set on the high seas needs to hit more dramatic high points than ""Master and Commander"" is eventually able to muster.
Having said all that, it seems a bit perverse and paradoxical to now point out that ""Master and Commander"" also draws its greatest strength from the fact that it doesn't rely on cheap melodramatics to achieve its power.  Thanks to outstanding direction, set design and special effects, we really feel as if we are on one of those early 19th Century sailing vessels, a feeling that is enhanced even more in the battle scenes which are executed with a stunning eye for believability and detail.  And there are many moments of silent intensity particularly between Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and resident naturalist, obviously modeled on Charles Darwin (though 30 years earlier than Darwin), who can't understand why Aubrey has to go off fighting Bonaparte's forces when all Maturin wants is to be able to go traipsing all over the Galapagos Islands in search of new and fascinating faunal specimens (at least Darwin didn't have to contend with some pesky war when he was off developing his Theory of Evolution).  The subtle interplay between these two characters provides for some of the most gripping moments in the film.  Russell Crowe manages to convey both authority and compassion in his role of Aubrey, and Paul Bettany creates a compelling foil for him in Maturnin.  Aubrey is also up against the superstitious nature of his disgruntled crew who attribute much of their troubled journey to the curse laid upon them by a vindictive god (vide ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"").  The filmmakers also do an effective job exploring the internal decision-making process a person in authority often has to go through in weighing the good of the group against the good of the individual.  The fact that Aubrey isn't a raving lunatic (like Ahab) lessens the drama but heightens the verisimilitude of the piece.
""Master and Commander"" is a bit of a close call for me, but taken as a whole, its virtues ultimately outweigh its flaws.",1074038400,9,3960,4.879284649776453
1864812,5,B00008W64E,"Below decks are dim, crowded, and dirty. When water and cold air chill sailors to the bone, there is nowhere to seek warmth and comfort. The most fascinating happening on the boat, apart from the evening drinking and singing revelries, is the doctor's meticulous attempts to replace part of a man's skull with a coin. Occasionally, an enemy ship will engage in battle; then the thrills and action will be accompanied by blood and fatalities.
Welcome aboard the Surprise, a British navy ship during the Napoleonic Wars. Peter Weir (Gallipoli, The Truman Show) gives a grim and realistic picture of early 19th century battles and ship life. Russell Crowe (L.A. Confidential, The Insider) plays ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, captain of the Surprise. After attacked by a greater French ship, the Acheron, Aubrey is determined to find and defeat the ""Phantom Boat"", as it is at first dubbed. However, Aubrey's determination leads to near obsession as he peruses the Acheron (which is also following him) no matter what the odds are.
The sails on the sailing ships are grimy, but still beautiful as they billow in the breeze. The movie itself is gritty but magnificent, and the sets and costumes are all created with exquisite care. Sailors are fairly grubby, the food is unappetizing, and light is faint when lanterns are its only source. The ships themselves are gorgeous, though tiny when compared to the number of men who serve on them.
The scenery is absolutely stunning, even though most of the shots involve simply a ship or two surrounding by water, miles and miles of water. There are a few detours to the Galapagos Islands, which are filmed just as breathtakingly as the other scenes.
Acting is first rate. Crowe is excellent, of course, as the dogged and resolute Captain Jack Aubrey, popular leader of the Surprise. The surgeon, played by Paul Bettany (Dogville, A Beautiful Mind), is another interesting character. He is an intellectual who questions the accepted British hierarchy and sailor superstitions, and is enthralled by natural science. Other characters include a young boy, Max Pirkis, in his first movie role, and an indecisive midshipman, played by Lee Ingleby. Most characters are not elaborated, but they are all believable and serve for some poignant moments.
Dialogue is wonderful, literate, though it could be considered corny at times. The violence can be very grisly, especially in the aftermath of fighting, though the battles themselves are mercifully swift and blurred.
Master and Commander is supported by rousing music. Despite its gore and realism, the movie is entertaining and stirring. Highly recommended, though the queasy may cringe at scenes. Fans of sea tales and adventures of any sort should not miss this.
Minor Quibble: With the extensive attention to every detail in this movie, I wish they could have made the captain and the doctor look like they were actually playing stringed instruments. Actually, it could have been worse.",1073779200,4,2963,5.0862422997946615

Although many people think the storyboard wasn't as interesting as the lord of the rings, I still say that the great acting skills and well shot scenes make up for the plot.  Personally, I thought that the plot was unique and creative.  The media got a small taste of a different genre of cinematography.  Master and Commander, to my point of view, deserves best picture for the year 2003.  Good job Russ!",1073433600,3,556,4.51
1864814,5,B00008W64E,"If you have heard negative criticism of this movie, please don't listen!  Clear your mind.  Go in with an open mind ready to receive a favorable impression!
Why this plea?!?!  Well, I waited for months for this movie to release, and I was delighted to see it on it's opening night.  I loved the movie, and I loved it even more the 2nd time around.  (As with Return of the King, I found the movie so epic & full of action that I needed to watch it more than once to absorb the subtleties of the plot & character development.)  However, I was quite depressed when my 20-something year old friends panned the movie & said it was one of the worst ever.
If you are brand new to O'Brian & his works, then it may help for you to understand a few things.  O'Brian was a tireless historian & naturalist.  Every battle battle in his books (not those in the movie, though) were battles that really happened with the 19th century British Navy.  All the details of the ship build, the meals eaten, the language, the countries visited, etc. are all true to the times.  And, thankfully, the movie has been very faithful to this detail.
However, I think my friends were confusing the glimpse we get at this distant culture with their modern day version of life.  For instance, in the movie the captain makes a truly shameless pun which WAS said at the time...it shows you the kind of humor the sailors used to get through their tough life.  However, my friends took that to be the humor of the movie itself, which is a very different thing.  The humor in the script is a very subtle one based on character development & understanding.
So, that all said, I think the movie was absolutely fantastic.  You have to pay attention some to see where minor characters are developed, where dialogue is important, and where subtle themes are brought through the movie.  But, if you do, I don't think you will be disappointed.  I think Weir does a masterful job of bringing together great action scenes & fine, tender themes.
As for the cast:
 - Crowe was a flawless Captain Aubrey.  He really makes the movie & everything hangs on his performance.  You believe in his integrity, his care & his grit.
 - Bettany was a very good match as the doctor.  He showed both the strength of his personality (a good balance for Aubrey) and also his neurotic weaknesses.
 - Boyd (a plug for the LOTR actor) did quite admirably in a very different role for him.  Rather than act as the ignorant mischief-maker (Pippen), he is the go-to sailor.  He is there at crunch-time & is fully reliable.  He seems to have enjoyed this role & filled it well.
 - The rest of the crew filled in their places admirably in order for you to be truly absorbed in this tale.
And, finally, perhaps one of the most riveting aspects that they captured so well was the ship's delicate constitution - not the boat but the crew.  They had to bear tight quarters, extreme weather, sickness, lack of food, battles & traumatic losses  - all while staying strong & preparing for the next challenge.  I thought this movie did a phenomenal job in showing how the sailors and officers lived & survived emotionally in such a world.",1073347200,6,3158,4.481611208406305

Russell Crowe is mesmerizing as the British captain, Jack Aubrey.  Aubrey's ship doctor and friend, brilliantly played by Paul Bettany (in quite a departure from his role in ""A Beautiful Mind""), provides all sorts of dramatic tension you wouldn't expect in a typical high-seas adventure film.  But this film is not typical: beyond the basic plot of a high-stakes naval cat-and-mouse game, it is a film about duty-duty to country, to crew, to a friend, to one's self.  As Aubrey's mission unfolds, all these various duties come into conflict, and it is in how he resolves them that the true magnificence of his character is revealed.  Besides fantastic acting top to bottom, the film features a witty and thoroughly engaging screenplay, accurate set designs down to the last detail, cinematography that captures the feel of the high seas from dead calm to raging storms, charming subplots, and of course...plenty of action.",1073260800,2,1083,5.1657142857142855

What with all of the extraordinary technology director Peter Weir hurls at us, it would be difficult to subscribe a 50's feel to it. Nevertheless it has that larger than life feel to it not uncommon in some of those earlier ""epic"" works.
Crowe is a larger than life actor, and fits well into the garb of Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, Captain of HMS Surprise. His orders - to shadow and destroy the enormous French warship, the Acheron. Captain Aubrey's friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, equally well played by Paul Bettany, is a formidable advocate for compassion as Crowe is for leadership.
The Surprise steals the show, and 10 minutes after the movie begins we forget we are on the pitching deck of a 200 foot frigate in the South Atlantic.
Jolly good show. Makes movie goers want to see more period pieces and book readers read more of Patrick O'Brian. Larry Scantlebury",1073001600,4,976,4.747058823529412
1864818,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is one of the better nautical films to be released in a long time. That is partially due to the fact that there are not many films that take place at sea. It is refreshing to watch a film about naval fleets and the battles they fought on the high sea, without having to add romance or make your prototypical hero characters. Russell Crowe gives a good performance as the commander of the fleet and is very believeable in the role. His character is a man who only knows the sea and only knows victory, and it is a loss at sea that is the premise for the film as his character, Lucky Jack, pursues his enemy at all cost to win. Paul Bettany also fairs well as the doctor on the ship and explorer when Lucky Jack allows the crew to dock on land. The exploring side of this film is its most interesting aspect, as not many films have shown us characters and explorations like this. The two battle scenes are very well staged and executed, as is the rest of the cast, especially the children sailors, who have more responsibility at sea than many adults would ever have in their life. There are some boring spots in this long film, but it is worth the price to see a well done film. Peter Weir is one of the best directors around, and while the film falls short of being great, Weir's direction does not. Crowe and Bettany both put in performances worthy of Oscar talk, but not nominations. This film will have to settle for being a very good film, and that is nothing to apologize for.",1073001600,25,1502,4.310954063604241
1864819,5,B00008W64E,"The setting is aboard a British ship in 1805.  And every modern advanced filming technique as been used with perfection to bring it all to life.  It made the experience not just one of merely watching a film.  I felt I was actually on that ship  during the storms and the battles and the quiet times when there was no wind.  I got to know each of the characters and watched their complex personalities interact and develop in this small wooden world which was their life and their livelihood.
Russell Crowe is the captain of the HMS Surprise.  He rules his ship with a tough minded decisiveness that earns him respect from his men.  Off the coast of Brazil, they are suddenly attacked by a French ship.  They manage to get away but know they will be attacked again.  Russell Crowe is determined to win -- so determined in fact that it made me think of Moby Dick and Captain Ahab's quest for the great white whale.  Cast in an equally important role is Paul Bettany.  He is the ship's doctor and we get to see him perform some medical marvels for his time.  Some of these scenes made me wince, especially one scene where he amputates the arm of young Max Pirkis, a 13-year old midshipman who immediately won my heart, especially as he manages to not only continue to perform his shipboard duties with one arm, he also absorbs the doctor's true passion for biology, and draws replicas of new plants and insects that they discover during their travels.
There is more to this film that the technically masterful battles and storms.  There is also an unusually amount of intense detail of daily life on the ship as well as a great deal of character development.  The Captain and the doctor have a deep friendship, and even play duets on a violin and cello.  They are constantly engaged in philosophical discussions and there is often tension between them.  The doctor wants to spend time on the Galapagos Islands, studying the biological diversity of the terrain.  The captain, however, is obsessed with fighting the French ship.  How this all plays out shows each man's respect for each other.
We also get to meet a whole cast of sailors on the ship and there are several interesting subplots which add reality to the film. I felt I was right there with them, sharing their life at sea.  Perhaps this was because I saw the film on a big screen in a theater.  But I suspect I'd love it just as much on a DVD and would probably watch all the special features about the challenge of filming it.  As far as I'm concerned this film has it all -- action, adventure, personal conflicts, questions of integrity and hard choices that have to be made.

1864821,4,B00008W64E,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" gives its audience insight into the mysterious world of sailing.  We all know about pirates, sea battles, and swash-buckling, but do we really know about the men behind it all?  No.  Never before have we been given such a privileged look into the lives and hearts of those brave men at sea.  Peter Weir's film follows the British naval ship HMS Surprise and her crew during the Napoleonic Wars as they are relentlessly pursued by the far superior French ship, the Acheron.
Russell Crowe, one of the finest actors to come along in the past decade, plays Captain Jack Aubrey.  Aubrey is a man who demands perfection and respect from his crew, yet is enormously loved and respected by all of them.  It is here that ""Master and Commander"" finds its strength, in the comradery of men.  The naval battle sequences are grand and epic, the dialogue witty, the cast pitch-perfect, the sets and costumes flawless, and the score heart-pounding.  Yet it all boils down to the friendships and bonds between the men.  That is the true heart of ""Master and Commander"".

I would expect this film to rate well in the forthcoming Oscars.  Crowe's role is absolutely dominant. He is truly the master and commander in this seafaring epic.
I have been told that the original book involved an American ship as the ""baddies"" but, to sell the story to the US market, a French ship was put in its place.  This has no impact on the overall film which is quite awe inspiring.
Peter Weir's direction of the film is magnificent.  The on board scenes with the rigging creaking and the ship rolling are totally believable.  There is also a ""cameo role"" for the Galapagos Islands where the ship's doctor moves to within a whisker of scooping Darwin.

1864824,4,B00008W64E,"In the year when the LOTR's ""Return of the King"" understandably reigned the big epic film productions, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" came as a pleasant surprise. In fact, it's not that surprising that the topic of naval battles in Napoleonic times (around 1805) got such a good treatment in the hands of down-under-born Peter Weir (""Truman Show"", ""Fearless"", ""Gallipoli"", ""The Year of Living Dangerously"").
Weir's compatriot Russell Crowe is again very comfortable in a highly masculine role of Captain Jack Aubrey, an ambitious, skilled mariner who considers it the highest honour to pursue, to fight with and to beat the better-equipped French ship Acheron. The movie's battle scenes abound with realistic special effects, with the storm scene in the film's second half-hour being certainly among the best cinematic feats of its kind.
But equally -- if not even more -- impressive are intimate portraits of Aubrey and ship surgeon Stephen Maturin (played exquisitely by relative newcomer Paul Bettany), who, although a good friend, is an antagonist character to Aubrey's, displaying nature-loving spirit and at times 'democratically' opposing Aubrey's leadership. Another endearing character is the young Lord Blackeney (Max Pirkis), who grows in both firsthand battlefield experience and touring Galapagos Islands to become either another great ship commander, or another scientist.
Collective spirit, religiousness and patriotism of the English mariners add colour to the film and provide excellent food for thought for viewers. Occassional humour, unobtrusive yet tasteful music score and not an overdose of violence (although there is a fair share of it) makes this also a decent film for women. At times a bit slow, but overall a very enjoyable film, sporting beautiful cinematography and lessons in battle navigation, ""Master and Commander"" may in the future rank among the classics and has certainly enriched Weir's directorial canon already.",1072483200,,1971,5.4868421052631575

1864826,5,B00008W64E,"Russell Crowe is magnificent as ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, captain of the HMS Surprise.  Aubrey and his crew are hoping to intercept and destroy Acheron, a powerful and speedy French warship. The year is 1805, and the French are at war with the British. Capturing Acheron would give the British a much-needed naval victory against Napoleon. However, Aubrey and his crew soon discover that Acheron's captain is an extremely clever tactician and a formidable opponent.  After a crippling battle, Aubrey must decide whether to lick his wounds and head for home or continue his pursuit of Acheron.
Peter Weir gets high praise for his meticulous direction of ""Master of Commander.""  The movie looks authentic down to the smallest detail.  Weir shows us how crewmen behaved while living for months on board a warship.  Scenes of tempestuous storms, raging battles, wounded men screaming in agony, and young boys trying to act as courageous as their adult heroes are unforgettable.  The cinematography by Russell Boyd and Sandy Sissell is breathtaking.
Russell Crowe completely inhabits the body and soul of Jack Aubrey, who at times acts like a man possessed.  His pride and strong sense of duty sometimes blind him to reality.  Yet, Aubrey is also a man of principle, compassion, and deep feeling, who cares very much about the men under his command. Paul Bettany is Crowe's counterpart as the intellectual, sensitive, and outspoken Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's talented surgeon and a gifted naturalist. On quiet evenings, Stephen plays classical music with his old friend, Captain Aubrey, but the two men eventually clash over Aubrey's obsession with completing his mission successfully.
Although ""Master and Commander"" takes place in the nineteenth century, its themes are relevant to the times in which we live. Weir raises very interesting questions about the nature of patriotism and leadership.  Crowe, in a gritty and sharply delineated performance, demonstrates the agony of making decisions that will inevitably lead to a loss of life.
""Master and Commander"" is a swashbuckling movie that one rarely sees these days, and it is also a thoughtful look at courage, determination, love of country, and humanity.  It is a wonderful movie that is one of the best of 2003.",1072224000,6,2266,5.166666666666667
1864827,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is the latest attempt by the Hollywood establishment to revive the nautical adventure genre that enjoyed great popularity during Hollywood's ""golden age."" Based on Patrick O'Brian's phenomenally successful novels about British heroism during the Napoleonic Wars, the film traces the efforts of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his loyal crew to intercept and destroy an errant French warship in the Pacific waters near the Galapagos Islands. Although this movie will disappoint any audience member who is expecting a great deal of background information about the historical intricacies and personalities of the Napoleonic Age, it will thrill and entertain all filmgoers who love the kinetic energy and old-fashioned showmanship of a well directed swashbuckler.

Veteran director Peter Weir is entitled to an Oscar nomination simply for staging some of the most dazzling and exhilarating naval battle sequences of all-time. The violent encounters between Aubrey's HMS Surprise and its French counterpart the Acheron were so gripping and realistic that several audience members at the showing I attended were literally gasping for breath as they left the theater (the sound of cannon fire and rushing water no doubt reverberating in their ears). However, Weir deserves the most credit for his detailed and provocative portrayal of every aspect of life aboard a British warship, circa 1805. Audiences get to see the chief lieutenants create strategies and chart courses, the midshipman cope with the responsibilities holding authority over much of the crew while still conforming to the expectations of their superiors, and the common sailors, mates and boatswain confront unbearable weather and inedible food as they prepare to risk their lives for the country they love. Several characters leave an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of viewers, particularly Max Pirkis as a prepubescent crew member who faces the amputation of an arm with unwavering courage and Lee Ingleby as an indecisive midshipman who becomes convinced that his presence is cursing the ship. The battle scenes owe much of their punch and power to Weir's realization that it is far more engaging to watch complex, multifaceted figures battle it out for God and country than it is to watch caricatured personalities scramble through combat without purpose or motivation.

At the center of the fray is Russell Crowe, who thoroughly captures Captain Aubrey's intensity and charisma. It isn't easy to play a character that orders the vicious beating of an unruly sailor in one scene and makes charming toasts to wives and sweethearts (""may they never meet!"") in another, but Crowe succeeds brilliantly by imagining Aubrey as an impulsive individualist who stands by his instincts and emotions in any context. When the Captain engages in heated philosophical discussions about loyalty and leadership with his friend Dr. Steven Maturin (Paul Bettany), it is riveting to watch the star's fascinating portrait of a man obsessed with his own righteousness. Crowe will almost certainly reap some significant awards from this impressive performance, and at the very least he has found a profitable new franchise to sail through the rest of the decade with.",1072137600,5,3275,5.3572815533980584
1864837,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is like a sea journey, sailing on for 138 minutes without any particular destination in mind. You see plenty of lovely sights, and get a few snatches of swashbuckling and derring-do, but you get all that without benefit of plot or character development. This is a film that is literally all about the journey, not the destination. It is, though, a rather entertaining journey at times, and never a dull one. YES you read right, despite the length, this film is good. Not as good as Lord of the Rings mind you, but better than The Last Samaria. Plot is following Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe, who must be a great actor because he's so likable in his movies even though he's a jerk in real life. The year is 1805, and Aubrey is piloting the HMS Surprise, out chasing down one of Napoleon's boats, which is said to be intent on spreading the Napoleonic Wars to South America. The Surprise is damaged in an early skirmish with the French vessel, but Aubrey does not turn back. He insists on repairing the ship at sea even as it continues its pursuit. This is folly, says the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin ), who is also Aubrey's best friend. Stephen suggests it's Aubrey's personal pride that's getting in the way of making a more rational decision, and that his crew's lives are at stake. Aubrey says no, that's not it, and the matter is dropped. Did you blink? Because if you did, you missed all you're going to get in the way of character arcs or personal struggles. Unlike most protagonists, Aubrey does not learn, grow or change over the course of the film. He's presented as a larger-than-life leader who doesn't make mistakes, and even his apparent mistakes turn out for the best. Sad thing is, I know people like that! The direction by Peter Weir (""The Truman Show,"" ""Dead Poets Society"") is praiseworthy indeed, as nearly the entire film takes place on the open sea, and the guy actually had a real ship built for that reason. It is far more exhilarating to see actual people on an actual boat on the actual ocean than it is to see them computer-generated, or to have scenes shot in water tanks on studio lots. Where trickery has been used, it's been integrated seamlessly with the real thing. As a viewer, it's a little thrilling to be part of a seafaring adventure, even if we're not really going anywhere.

My wife was actually the one who wanted to see this, she says largely because of the its great reviews. I think it had more to do with the birds (Crowes in particular). That said, she agreed to leaving about an hour and a half into the film because it just wasn't working for us.
The film begins, and I assume ends, on a boat.  I'm not sure anyone ever steps foot on dry land.  Sure, there is action, suspense, the guy everyone is rooting for but whom you're sure will get killed somewhere along the way, but somewhere along the line they forget to ""insert plot here.""
The problem with the movie is that the lulls between action scenes are terribly long.  And the ""Master and Commander"" as played by Russell Crowe is supposed to be some hotshot military tactician, but even I raised an eyebrow when, in the middle of a fogbank while looking for the enemy ship, he's ringing bells on his boat.  I mean seriously.  The last thing you do on open water is make noise if you're trying to hide.  There were several scenes like this.  Another is where the ""phantom"" enemy ship sneaks up on Crowe's crew yet again and Crowe is incredulous.  My thoughts, ""Well Russell my boy, every time you and your crew are below deck getting drunk, the phantom captain hits you out of the blue.""
So either the books are poorly written, or I'm way more knowledgeable about military tactics than I think I am, or sea captains were just stupid. Either way, the film was a terrible bore with no discernible plot other than chasing down another boat.  That's it.  Enjoy!",1072137600,5,1631,4.457912457912458

1864842,5,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir, a director whose work I have often admired, has done a wonderful job with this material, delivering the best evocation of life aboard a 19th century war ship ever put on film.  The quality of the production and the seemless blending of real sailing vessels, models and CGI work cannot be over-praised.  It is marvelous work in set, cinematography and sound.
Couple all that with a fine cast, led with the conviction and commanding (pun intended) screen presence of Russell Crowe,and tell the crackling good tale of a deadly game of cat-and-mouse played on the high seas, and you have a wonderful adventure filled with humor, action and suspense.  They got it right in all departments.
A straight-ahead action/adventure drama, Weir and company have produced a first rate film that stays within its period and material, lightly touching on the themes of honor and duty, without the heavy-handed, oblique references to our own times found in The Last Sumarai.  Makes us believe we are witnessing life in another time, with very different living conditions, and different notions of purpose and duty.

1864843,4,B00008W64E,"In 1805, Great Britain is at war with Napoleon's France. The warship HMS Surprise under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is charged with the responsibility of preventing France from gaining control of the South Seas by intercepting the French warship Acheron as it travels down the South American coast. A dangerous battle of wits and wills ensues between Captain Aubrey of the Surprise and his counterpart on the vastly technologically superior Acheron. The Surprise's crew must battle nature's whims as well as  their own foolishness in their dogged pursuit of an elusive enemy. Friction develops between the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), and the Captain, close friends but men of opposite interests and ambitions, as Maturin questions the wisdom of this seemingly suicidal mission.
""Master and Commander"" is based on the popular series of Aubrey/Maturin novels, set during the Napoleonic Wars, by author Patrick O'Brian. The entire film takes place at sea aboard a relatively small sailing vessel. Director Peter Weir succeeds brilliantly in giving us a sense of the isolated, enclosed, and vulnerable world in which the crew lives, and the unique culture in which seamen of the time spent their lives. The naval battles are spectacular and riveting. The audience can feel the plight of the crews of these naval warships who were like sitting ducks with nothing to protect them from incoming cannon fire or from the unforgiving ocean. Russell Crowe gives one of his finest performances as Captain Jack Aubrey, a man of imposing but just character who inspires loyalty and fortitude in his men. Crowe actually had me convinced that he could be a British naval officer who lived two centuries ago. It is a rare actor who can break free of modern mannerisms and values to successfully inhabit a character from a very different world, and Crowe's portrayal of Aubrey is even more rare in that he makes the man terrifically charismatic at the same time.
""Master and Commander"" doesn't actually have much of a story. It's a game of cat and mouse on the high seas. The film loses its focus during its second half and deteriorates into a bit of a soap opera before recovering for the finale. And I really wasn't interested in seeing yet another film in which a ship is batted about while trying to round Cape Horn. But the film's performances and gripping naval battles are its strength. Russell Crowe's Captain Aubrey is a pleasure to watch, and the supporting cast is very fine as well. Paul Bettany is perfect as Aubrey's counterpoint. And Max Pirkis gives a memorable performance as Will Blakeney, a young midshipman of 12 or 13 years. I recommend ""Master and Commander"" for its great naval battles and fine performances.

1864844,4,B00008W64E,"I was wary of this movie from the previews, as it seemed like it had focused on only one part of the wonderful Patrick O'Brian books--the character of ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey--and used that as a vehicle for Russell Crowe. No other actor got ""named"" in the preview, for one, and the whole focus of the preview seemed to be on Crowe looking pensive or decisive or jumping into action. But the preview isn't the movie, and even though all those things are in the movie, there's a whole lot more.
I really shouldn't have worried, as the director and co-screenwriter is Peter Weir, whose films I have enjoyed in the past (most recently, The Truman Show, another ""vehicle"" for a star at the top of the heap of the moment). And, having read some of the source material, I knew that there was depth to these characters. My interest in the books had as much to do with the interplay between the patriotic, stuffed-shirt Aubrey and the subversive, idealistic Maturin as it did with the minutia of who had the weather gauge and the day-to-day life for nearly 200 men aboard a floating bunch of wood.
The film captures both quite well, although Crowe's Aubrey doesn't come across quite as proud and full-of-himself as he does in the books (in fact, the movie hardly shows a chink in his armor). But it shows his character's cleverness and resourcefullness, just as it shows the doctor's inquistiveness and sea naiveity. It also emphasizes on the roughness of the life, showing the bilge, the carpentry, the lash, the need for rum and provisions, and the constant practicing with the guns. But, best of all, while Crowe's character is important, for most of the plot, he is ancilliary as we follow aspects of the rest of the crew: the midshipman whom the others see as a ""Jonah,"" the young lord who loses his arm in the first battle, and the doctor himself, wounded at a critical juncture. I hesitate to say more about the plot, as that might detract from someone's enjoyment of the story, and for an action movie, it truly is the story that makes this one shine.
The soundtrack is perfect, with the wood constantly creaking and groaning, and I'm thankful that no one has ever perfect smell-o-vision, because the visuals were enough of a suggestion in that direction.
There's twenty books in the O'Brian series, and I'm sure that some studio head is slavering at the box office receipts and thinking sequel. If so, I hope that the next will feature a director as good as Weir and bring in some of the romantic subplot with Sophie or the undercover exploits of Maturin. This movie has established the main characters, just as the first book did, and if a sequel is to be any good, it has to do just as O'Brian did and be more than ""Hornblower, Too"" but a fascinating look into a very alien world, so unlike our own today.",1071360000,6,2803,4.57455268389662

 I laugh when I read the reviews from Big Name reviewers that say such great things about this film.

What it doesn't offer is a particularly compelling story. The rather thin plot blends two novels by Patrick O'Brian, and most of both of them seems to be missing. This film, I guess, isn't about telling a story - it's about recreating life aboard an English naval vessel in 1805, and on that count it succeeds brilliantly, not only in the vividly realised physical details and extraordinary battles, but in the group psychology of men. Still, the central relationship between Captain Aubrey (Crowe) and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin (Bettany) doesn't go much beyond the ""morality vs. duty"" cliche - the story doesn't give it a chance to. Overall, this isn't a five-star affair. For all its big-budget realization, it offers little more than a good episode of LWT's ""Hornblower"". Actually, I think it offers a bit less.

I am not a Russell Crowe fan by any stretch of the imagination, but I thought he was perfect in this part as Capt. ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey. The cinematography was just breath taking. The attention to all of the details even the minor ones was exceptional. Although I have to agree with some of the other reviewers the little ""duet"" scenes were a bit too long and slow. At some points in the movie the supporting characters stole the film from the principal characters, especially the young actor who played Lord Blakeney.

1864850,4,B00008W64E,"If you're prepared for a long, involved drama of Napoleonic sea farers as opposed to the high adventure antics of Pirates of the Caribbean, you really should love this film.
Unfortunately, the studios marketed this film as a big action film (""Gladiator on water""), and most of the complaints I've heard about this film are people not getting what they expected and/or wanted. It's also possible that people who would really love this film won't see it because of this.
Master and Commander runs close to being a character study. Not of Capt. Jack Aubrey, but the entire crew as an entity. The entire film (for the most part) takes place on the H.M.S. Surprise (Aubrey's ship), and the story is about this crew trying to hunt down an enemy ship of the French which is bigger, faster, has more guns with longer range, and more heavily armored. The story focuses on the lives of the characters aboard this ship during this mission, and time can often go for weeks on end without ever seeing the enemy. Just like a real ship in these times, the adventure is slow paced.
However, those who appreciate strong dramas will find much to love about this picture. Both Crowe and Bettany give strong performances (as does everyone in this pic). Just like in Gladiator, Crowe gives a performance that really makes you believe these men would follow him. Bettany plays a civilian doctor and the only person Crowe doesn't have authority over allowing him to be the voice of reason as Jack Aubrey's desire to get this French ship verges on dangerous obsession.
The fact that they don't make movies like this hardly ever is reason alone to catch this film on the big screen. In the next few years we're gonna have our fill of ancient greek/roman films, but it may be a very long time before we see a film like this again which is quite possibly the best of this type ever filmed.
My one real complaint about the film was the ending. A twist is thrown in that caught me by surprise, but I really didn't like it because it not only invalidates most of the story up to that point but completely changes the tone of the film. Where up to that point the entire film is strong, realistic drama in the vein of Saving Private Ryan, the ending is something that would fit the light hearted antics of Pirates of the Caribbean. It didn't ruin the film but it did leave an unwanted after taste.",1070755200,2,2365,4.52803738317757
1864851,5,B00008W64E,"Having never read Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, I can't address how faithful Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is to the source material. (I have gleaned that the fans of O'Brian's novels probably wouldn't be satisfied with ANY film version.) I can definitely say, however, that Weir rivets our attention from the very first seconds of this movie, taking us into the far corners of the tall ship in the early morning fog, and never lets go of it until the final credits. Aided immeasurably by the magnficent camera work of Russell Boyd, Weir takes us into realms of thought, feeling and experience where the cinema seldom goes. He gives us a vivid picture of life aboard a British man-of-war during the Napoleonic wars, and draws us so deeply into the teamwork and camaraderie of the crew that we feel as if we're climbing the riggings ourselves. In a way, the actors are just as much a crew as the sailors they portray; none of them stands out, but all of them put their shoulders together and work as a perfect team, each man (there are, of course, no women on board) holding up his end to perfection. Even the starring performance of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey, courageous and consummately skilled ship's captain, is a masterpiece of understated team playing; different in degree but not in kind from his mates, he commands the movie but never overwhelms or bullies it. Likewise, Paul Bettany--standing a little apart from the rest of the crew as ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin--is a marvel of quiet, unobtrusive authority. There are some great debates between Aubrey, man of action, and Maturin, man of intellect, on the conduct of war and the nature of command; yet in the end they work together as a team, their essential harmony symbolized by their duets on the violin and cello. (Of the other actors in the film, special mention must be made of 13-year-old Max Pirkis as midshipman Lord Blakeney, who--after suffering a series of extreme traumas--lives up to his promise as a budding commander of men.) ""Master and Commander"" is such a consistently compelling action film that it catches you by surprise with its frequent moments of tragic emotion (hint: don't get too attached to any of the characters).

I was entirely caught up in the fast-paced and historically believable action. Not having heard previously about the series of books upon which this movie is based, I first saw the trailer and decided I would like it, then almost changed my mind when I read many peer reviews that said ""women wouldn't like it.""
Oh, how wrong they were! For the last 30 years, I have breathed, eaten, and slept history, and I continue to do so. My thirst for even more knowledge knows no bounds. Movies like this one, that even make a good attempt to portray a historical period, almost always catch my interest. Russell Crowe plays Captain Jack perfectly; I could not even begin to consider any other popular actor for the role. He happened to also be the only member of the cast whose name I knew, but it mattered not. The entire cast and crew put together a superb production and I have no criticisms for the few liberties they took.
When the movie ended, it was only then I came back to ""reality"" and physically drew a breath. I think I'd been favorably hypnotized during the nearly 3 hour movie.  I felt like I'd been on the ship too, hidden back inside some safe nook but inexorably drawn in.  I had the same reaction to Crowe's ""A Beautiful Mind"" when I saw it. Crowe seems to have the inate ability to actually BECOME the character, not just portray a character; he truly has proven himself to be a master of his craft, his personal shenanigans notwithstanding.

I wasn't disappointed that in this case I was wrong, however, if you're expecting a total action, adventure war movie, this isn't it.  The story it self is strong and most of the movie has well acted scenes and good cinematography, however I was a little bit let down with the fighting sequences.  I think the fact that the set is so small, being the deck of a boat at sea, that it made it difficult to make the battles seem more real and exciting to watch.
There is a lot going on between the two main characters, the captain and the ships doctor, one wants to advance science and the other wants to accomplish a goal, to beat his own demons by not letting go of his quest to capture an enemy vessel.
I wish I could say this is a great movie and one to own for sure, but having just watched The Pirates of the Caribbean movie, with non stop action and adventure, it's hard to say I'd want to watch this one again in the near future.

Life in the Navy is far different now than it was 200 years ago, but one thing hasn't changed - 23 hours and 59 minutes of boredom are punctuated by one minute of sheer terror. This film captures that very well. The battle scenes were great, but just as spellbinding was the attention to detail on the deck of Suprise - from the ship's sounds to the ground tackle, this was well-researched and well-executed.
Some reviewers have said it was slow paced and boring, exhibiting no plot. This I can't understand. Perhaps movies like The MATRIX have stunted their attention span?
I give this one 5 stars, and will definitely add it to my DVD collection when available.",1070668800,3,731,4.630769230769231
1864855,3,B00008W64E,"Firstly let me say that I enjoyed the movie. It depicted as near as possible the conditions on board a British man of war in the early 19th century. However, even though it was adapted from a couple of Patrick O'Brian's books, it was almost plotless. Apart from the opening and closing battles, almost nothing happened. Personally, I felt that Crowe, even though he made a good attempt at the role of Aubrey, was miscast. I saw Gerard Depardieu as being the closest to the physical Aubrey, Stephen Rea as a perfect Maturin, and Peter Postlethwaite as an ideal Killick. To those people who had no interest in the Napoleonic era, the movie would have seemed deadly dull and would only appeal to die hard O'Brian fans who would have seen the O'Brian characters come to life. Very little was explained and at the close of the movie, most of the characters remained anonymous. American audiences, raised on a steady diet of wham bang action and special effects would be bored silly. Still it was streets ahead of the 'Hornblower' series which was full of historical inaccuracies and very much misrepresented the fictional Hornblower character.  All in all a good attempt at a difficult genre.",1070668800,,1187,4.790243902439024

1864857,4,B00008W64E,"Even from the very first preview of Russell Crowe's new nautical blockbuster, I had high hopes, and the much anticipated release didn't lead me, or audiences astray. Set much aboard the English ship ""H.M.S. Suprise"", it follows the story of Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Crowe), and his faithful crew, on a mission to capture and destroy a superior French cruiser tracking them during the Napoleonic Wars. When the French launch a suprise attack against the Suprise, badly damaging the ship and injuring much of the crew, Captain Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he embarks on a journey across two oceans to seek revenge. The stakes run high; the mission's success could preserve the Suprise and its crew as heroes, but on the other hand, it could cost them all their lives. From the coast of Brazil, to the tumultous Cape Horn to the icy waters of the Far Side of the World (hence, the title) it all draws closer to the climatic sea battle between the French, and Captain Jack.
In my opinion, the performances in this film are wonderful, considering they could have easily been overdone. As the rough and troubled Captain, Russell Crowe shows the true range of his talents, from the way he yells orders, to his expressions and faraway look in his eyes as he weighs the difficult decisions at hand. As the ship's doctor Stephen Maturin, Paul Bettany is equally as good, adapting to his character, and the thoughts and feelings that come with it, with an natural ease that only the best of the best possess. The duo who also appeared in last years ""A Beautiful Mind"", play up their chemistry again in this film, which adds to the splendor onscreen.
""Master and Commander"" is certainly one of this year's most decadent films, much of it owed to director Peter Weir. A three-time Oscar nominee, he brings to the screen a realistic depiction of life aboard a navy vessel in the 1800s, with a style and grace all his own. The cinematography is jaw-dropping, and the choices in shots during sea battles and aerial views of the wide open oceans give it a whole new dimension. Every cannon shell hitting and splintering the deck is heard, and you can almost taste the salty air on your tongue as you are gloriously transported back into the naval world during the Napoleonic Wars. Although it has some gory surgery scenes to turn even the strongest of stomachs, this film is truly a masterpiece, and recommended for all ages.",1070236800,13,2429,4.7176470588235295

1864864,5,B00008W64E,"The t.v. spot for this movie said that ""Master and Commander"" was the movie experience of a lifetime.  While that is clear hyperbole, ""Master"" does add up to one of the best films of the year, and a surefire oscar contender.  Set during the Napolionic Wars fo the early 1800s', the film is set around the coast of South America, as the HMS Surprise, led by Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) races to intercept a superior French vessel that aims at crossing the Pacific as a prelude to a possible war at sea on that side of the world.  Lucky Jack, as his shipmates call him, leads his able bodied crew on a race around South America to catach up to the French ship.
It is unavoidable, for me, to compare this film to the Summer hit ""Pirates of the Carribbean,"" since they are both seafaring adventures.  But where ""Pirates"" was swashbuckling fun directed by Gore Verbinski, ""Master"" is a powerful drama and war film, with themes of loyalty and duty skillfully balanced by director and co-writer Peter Weir.  Weir employs some clever camera techniques and photoesque special effects to bring the Surprise and the wild sea to life.  With a reported budget of $125 million, Weir got to mess around building an exact replica of  british and french naval warships, and shooting them in locations on the sea and dirtiying up the actors to give the viewer a stark look at life on a naval warship.
While the action is thrilling and kinetic fearuring a battle within the first five minutes and a climatic clash between the two ships, it's the quiet, intimate moments that make ""Master.""  The Galapagos islands provide a place of solitude for the Surprise's crew, as well as a place of heaven for the ship's doctor (Paul Bettany).  Also, the scenes where Bettany and Crowe duet on cello and violin are surprisingly poigiant.  The crew also recieves special attention with Weir making them seem flesh and blood human, instead of wanderers to Crowe and Bettany that would have happened in lesser hands.

It's not just a bunch of transparent 20th century actors playing the roles, one can clearly appreciate their efforts to even behave, speak and relate to each other in the ways of the time - it is often intellectual and does require paying attention to, but the rewards are very real and credible characters in a relatively simple, but extremely well written, storyline. It is violent in parts but not gratuitous, and you're amazed to come to the end of the movie and realise that you have to think about whether you actually heard any swearing whatsoever (there's only one word that I caught on a second viewing, but it's even easily missed).

1864867,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettnay proves to be one of the best movies of its genre (Wooden Ships and Iron Men era). Crowe is ideally cast and Bettnay proves to be an able support. Rest of the cast was quite historical as there were blacks aboard these ships. Using kids as midshipmen were also very accurate as most midshipmen were 12-14 years old boys. I think the real key elements of this movie was that it very historically accurate. The shipboard life, handling of the ship and all that was done superbly well. The movie basically centered around Crowe's character and how he affects those around him. In this, its a fantastic effort by Crowe and its very reflective on the screen. But this is a ""man's movie"" and not a date film in my opinion. There are no sex scene, no romantic scene and no pretty woman outside of that brief moment during resupply. There are a lot of character building, bloody combat and interpersonal conflicts. Because it is historically correct, many people whose knowledge of history is rather limited, might find some part of this movie rather confusing and its lingo, very foreign like.

1864868,4,B00008W64E,"MASTER AND COMMANDER is a film inspired by Patrick O'Brian's 20 novels about the British navy during the Napoleonic wars. I was recently talking with a man who, like me, is a great fan of the books. He was aghast that the filmmakers had had the nerve to combine plots from different novels and change the identity of the villains (from American to French)!  Well, it's true the film's storyline is cobbled together, but whether you're a fan or coming to this material for the first time, you'll get a film true to the spirit of the books.
Director Peter Weir makes almost no concessions to the audience. Almost immediately we're watching Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and the crew of the SURPRISE clear the decks for action. Indeed, most of the film involves Jack's pursuit of the French ship ACHERON that cripples the SURPRISE in the opening battle. Weir, like O'Brian in the books, puts us right in the middle. We get a sense of the work required to kepp the ship afloat, the close quarters, and the brotherhood of the men.
Russell Crowe is terrific here, I can't think of another star of his magnitude who would have been right for the role. Matching him as surgeon and Jack's friend Stephen Maturin is Paul Bettany, who deserves an Oscar nom for the scene where he performs surgery on himself. There's a brief detour to the Galapagos Islands where Maturin, naturalist, collects specimens until his trip is cut short.

1864869,5,B00008W64E,"Peter Weir has created one of the truly great &#8211; not a word to be thrown about lightly &#8211; movies of 2003, a 19th century age of sail epic starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. Based on two (with smaller plot threads from others) of Patrick O'Brian's well known Aubrey series of novels, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a story told with grace, daring, a bit of humor, conflict, and human bonding, on a level far beyond other movies of its ilk.
Crowe plays the role of captain of the HMS Surprise, Patrick Aubrey. A long-time veteran of the Royal Navy, Aubrey is faced with the daunting task of hunting down and stopping the French privateer Acheron, a strong, overpowering frigate that (as it turns out) was built in America and sold to the French (the frigate itself is a sister of sorts to the USS Constitution). Aubrey is initially surprised by the Acheron in a fogbank and after taking a beating, retreats and thus begins a sequence of events &#8211; a cat and mouse game that flip-flops repeatedly as the two captains try to get the upper hand.
Accompanying Aubrey is his good friend, Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor (played by Mr. Bettany). The two are very much contrasting characters that seem to have very little in common, except their love of music and their friendship. One failing in the movie is that the viewer is not really shown why they are friends, or Maturin's role as a spy, though this is hinted at. Both Aubrey and Maturin are played skillfully by Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bettany, and the other actors, especially that the very young Max Pirkis as Midshipman Blakeney, are well cast as various members of the crew.
Weir (and subsequently O'Brien's) depiction of life aboard a ship in the era is wonderfully authentic; the Surprise is packed full of food, livestock, timbers, rope, and crewmen. Everything is shoved aside when the ship clears for battle. Sand is poured on the floor to absorb blood as he tends to the wounded. They are seemingly very much in the middle of nowhere, and only occasionally see land or another ship.
The naval battle sequences are some of the best that have been ever captured on film. Like Saving Private Ryan, the effect of sound during battle is piercing, loud, and bone-jarring at times. This is no-holds barred combat, and every shot does damage, splinters wood, destroys rigging, tears canvas, and kills men. The hand-to-hand sequences are a little to shaky &#8211; probably better suited to the small screen better.
Effects work and cinematography are simply fantastic throughout. Master and Commander uses a well-tuned mixture of real-size ships, mock-ups, miniatures (by Peter Jackson's WETA), computer-graphics, and nearly everything else thrown in for good measure. A lot of this movie was filmed in a giant tub, but it'd be nearly impossible to tell. It should be noted that the Galapagos Islands sequence was filmed there, the first movie allowed to do so.
It's annoying that they had to combine two novels and change some of the plot elements (the privateer was originally an American ship during the War of 1812), and some may scoff that Aubrey would have even taken on such a larger ship. Some may claim that Master and Commander is boring; it is not a popcorn action movie, but more of a deliberately-paced period adventure that far surpasses in intelligence and moviemaking most of the action movies released this year. Look for numerous Oscars come next Spring. Master and Commander is the real deal.",1069804800,8,3499,4.813953488372093
1864870,4,B00008W64E,"An amazing film, Peter Weir's Master and Commander manages to capture all the hazards of the high seas. Russell Crowe plays ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey commander of the HMS Surprise. His mission is to pursue the French ship Acheron and destroy her preventing the French from further attacks on British ships. I've never read any of Patrick O'Brian's novels but this strong adaption by Weir written with John Colle switches the time frame of the British/American conflict of 1812 to the war between Britian and Napoleon's France in 1805.
Weir manages to breath life into O'Brian's creations with very authentic ships and settings. He captures all the brutality and grim, violent moments that sailors faced at sea. In many respects, the ship was more than home and more than country for these sailors; she was sanctuary and tomb for these sailors. The HMS Surprise was the only thing providing refuge from the harsh elements of the high seas. In battle, the ship if not well commanded could also become a death trap. If caught in a losing battle, these sailors were at the mercy of the ocean and the ocean was a brutal and deadly mistress.
Crowe and co-star Paul Bettany (Crowe's co-star from A Dangerous Mind)give outstanding performances. Their onscreen chemistry and conflicts generate enough dramatic sparks to keep the film heated during the sequences between battle. Bettany plays ship's surgeon and friend/confidant to Aubrey. He also acts as Aubrey's conscience providing him with a link to the civilized world he left behind. Although Aubrey doesn't always take his advice it provides perspective and an honest sense of how far he can push his crew.
The CGI ships and visual effects are very impressive. It's difficult to distinguish the sets from the CGI effects. The battle sequences are impressive. As a member of the audience you feel as if you've been dropped into a battle from two hundred years ago. As someone who hasn't read the books and has no sailing experience (or Naval experience), I still found the film fascinating, powerful and involving. Crowe's commanding presence also gives added power to this fine film. Although it isn't Weir's best film (and Weir has directed a number of outstanding films including The Truman Show, Picnic At Hanging Rock, The Last Wave, Witness, Fearless and The Year of Living Dangerously among many), it has moments as powerful and involving as his best. Although the film sags a bit in the middle as Aubrey searches for the French vessel the Acheon, the power of the material and performances keeps the audience interested and involved.",1069804800,2,2582,4.979166666666667
1864871,5,B00008W64E,"Sorry, I couldn't resist. ""Master and Commander"" is a wonderful film. To me the appeal lies in its superbly-drawn, multi-dimensional characters. Being in the company of these men is enough to make you endure the freezing cold, vertigo, smoldering sun, and paltry meals on a month-long ocean voyage. The interactions between Jack, the young Midshipman Blakeney, and the ship's doctor were a pleasure to watch. The characters acted with decency and intelligence, making them excellent companions despite the bloody battles, amputations, and whip-lashings. Peter Weir's direction is first-rate, perfectly depicting life on a sea vessel centuries ago. Who needs action when you have conversations like these? Russell Crowe creates yet another memorable character, easily matched by the doctor and the boy who plays the courageous and affable apprentice. When thinking about this movie, I won't remember the spectacle of ships firing on each other at close range, or the colossal waves crashing down on sodden decks, or the splintering of the mast beam by shrapnel. I'll remember the physician and Captain Jack participating in lively debates, gradually coming to understand one another, and doing their best to be tolerant. I'll also remember the doctor and the boy exploring the strange islands, discovering new species that haven't yet become extinct.",1069718400,4,1349,5.45933014354067

Despite the fact that the Acheron is larger, carries more guns, and has a larger crew, Aubrey convinces his men to begin a chase that takes them across two oceans around South America.
Russell Crowe gives a stunning performance as the lead character. I was completely drawn into in this film and the war came alive on the big screen.

What I was disappointed about was how incredibly cliched the movie is.  The writing was more appropriate to a period peice from the silent movie era than a current film.  And it has every stock character from a naval movie ever.  The weak officer, the near mutiny, the enemy ship who always appears like a ghost, the superstitous old sailor, etc., etc.  The dialogue was as wooden as the dialogue in Star Wars Phantom Menace and rarely gave Russell Crowe a chance to demonstrate his talent.
It gets two stars for being SO formulaic.  At least all of the completely predictable events were there, enough to give all of the hack critics out there a woody.  If it had tried to be A LITTLE creative and failed, it would have dropped to one star for me.  I'm sure those who read the book will be happy with it, but why you would want to pay eight bucks for something with no new fresh life is beyond me.
There's a reason this movie got beat out by Elf in it's debut week (despite the fact that Elf had already been out a week).  It is totaly tedious.",1069545600,3,1290,4.228571428571429

1864876,5,B00008W64E,"First off: wow. I've written many reviews on here before and I've never been so excited to write on such an astounding film.
Based on parts of the amazing Patrick O'Brian novel series, ""Master & Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" (combining the titles of the 1st and 10th book in the 20-book series) follows the story of Jack Aubrey, captain of the British ship Surprise and the adventure of its battle with the enemy Acheron ship of the French. This, of course, is an extremely simplified version, but explains the basic jist of this seafaring masterpiece. Fans of both the books and Crowe will certainly not be disappointed.
With an absolutely brilliant performance by Russell Crowe (I definitely smell Oscar nomination despite Crowe not living up to the large size of Aubrey deliberately detailed in the books) and impeccable direction by Peter Weir, ""Master & Commander"" quite arguably becomes the best film ever made in this line of subject matter. Its engrossing, invigorating, captivating and above all: absolutely entertaining. Weir immediately jumps into the action from the get go in a scene that goes from a foggy figure in the distance to a full-blown epic battle. To top it all off, the visuals are inexplicably perfect, capturing the natural beauty of its locations with a tinge of perfect special effects.
To pass this up would not only be foolish, but downright wrong. Now we can finally get over the last weekend's disasters and enjoy some incredible filmmaking.",1069545600,3,1482,4.955823293172691
1864877,5,B00008W64E,"The impressive and talented Russell Crowe leads a relatively unknown cast as British sea captain Jack Aubrey, commander of the H.M.S. Surprise in the Napoleonic Wars in 1805.  Crowe and his mates have been commissioned to dispatch the much faster and more powerful French ship Acheron off the coast of South America.
The impartial and patriotic Crowe cuts a venerable presence to his crew.  His decisions are precise and without hesitation but are modified by his devil's advocate, ship surgeon, Stephen Maturin played very capably by Paul Bettany.  It is through Maturin, a physician and naturalist that we can humanize the many hardships of the naval life at this time.
Director Peter Weir does a fantastic job in recreating the naval vessels and the gritty, grimy existence of sea going men.  The action and battle scenes are very authentic as are the ocean storms.  The reality created aboard the ship almost rivals the unparalleled classic, Das Boot.
The filming locations, which included the Galapagos Islands were truly dazzling and breathtaking.",1069545600,2,1053,5.170588235294118
1864878,4,B00008W64E,"I've read all the books twice, and look forward to reading them again. I have been anxiously awaiting the movie, and I have to say I did love it. But, I do not think it caught the beauty and depth of the personal relationships that O'Brian so well expressed. And, although it was excruciatingly true to detail, another O'Brian success, everything flew by so fast I was unable to savour it. I'm sure I will watch it many more times, as a devotee of the series, but I fear that it will not succeed as a major motion picture with those who are unaquainted with the books.
Of all the exchanges between Aubrey and Maturin that happened in the books, I am disappointed that the film focused on the evils of command. Steven lecturing Jack on his ambition and abuse of power did not ring true -- too Hollywood.
Jack was too happy a commander in the film; in the books, he had many more obstinacies to deal with, from the Admirality, his enemies on the sea, and his crew.
I had a hard time identifying the colorful characters in his crew in the film -- Pullings, yes, but not Bonden, Awkward Davies, Killick, Mowett, or the ""young gentlemen"" of the midshipmen. Not enough time to savour this, which gives much flavor to the community on board Surprise in the books.
Russel Crowe was an excellent choice as Jack Aubrey. I will always see him in my mind's eye when I read the books again. And the battle scenes add much to what we can read in the books -- certainly exciting a more visceral response.
I look forward to parsing the details on DVD that slipped by me in the film, but were most lovingly detailed by O'Brain in the books.
So, by all means see the film, but also read the books, if you haven't already. There is a lot of good stuff here in the film, but it needs to be enjoyed in context with the literature.",1069459200,3,1809,4.323529411764706

The characters and plot were masterfully brought to life by the actors, writers and directors. Almost all books are short-sheeted by their movies but it's the spirit of the books that must be adhered to. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World definitely came with that distinct Patrick O'Brian spirit.

1864880,5,B00008W64E,"A lot of good things have been said about the technical points of this movie. I've never been able to notice this sort of thing well so I won't bore anybody with my pathetic observations. I just want to explain the main points I feel this movie impresses on the viewer. Films never seem to be neutral - they always say something about how to live, or at least what comprises normal living. And a lot of the modern material Hollywood pumps out strikes me as shallow and unbeneficial. I can only see so many movies with great, awe-inspiring, muscular action heros who have no moral backbone before I start getting disillusioned with the cinema scene.
What I really liked about this movie was that it had a great view of what it's like to be a good man and leader. It showed the difficult decisions a leader like Jack Aubrey has to face, the courage and shrewdness required, the necessity of laughter and a good sense of humor, and a good sense of moral behavior and fulfillment of duty. It showed the need for not just fighting ability but also wisdom and culture - Captain Aubrey read literature, played his violin, and clearly was an educated man as set apart from the no-brains-all-brawn hero of too many of today's films. It portrayed the bravery and heroism possible even in boys; I thought the boy who had his arm amputated played his part very well, showing courage and conviction. A good dose of these traits are useful in the life of any man (or woman, for that matter).
I suppose it can be argued whether this was a technical masterpiece or something of a loser (I lean toward the former, of course *grin*). But I think it is clear from the get-go that this movie teaches very well how a leader should live. If I ever have any children, and boys in particular, I will definitely want them to watch this at the appropriate time. Courage and uprightness are something I think every parent would be proud to see in their children. This movie can help bring that about.",1069113600,11,1973,4.4986072423398324
1864881,5,B00008W64E,"MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a magnificent piece of filmmaking. The acting is superb, the historical details almost totally accurate, and great special effects.
The story revolves around Capt. Jack Aubrey and his crew aboard the British H.M.S. Surprise. It is 1805 and Napolean is conquering the world and now the seas. Aubrey's orders are to intercept the French ship Acheron and either destroy it or capture it. The Acheron surprises the Surprise twice and Jack vows it won't happen again.  Along the way we see the perils of life at sea and the comraderie (and sometimes displeasure) between the sailors.
Peter Weir hasn't made a film since THE TRUMAN SHOW and it is a delight to watch his latest achievement.  The movie is strongly story driven. However, unlike many films, the characters aren't underdeveloped.  We get a real sense of the lives of many of the shipman and we grow to like them.  There were two points in the movie where most of the audience sighed in shock as tragedy betook beloved characters.  Also, the musical score is beautiful and seems perfect for a sea-adventure film such as this.
I haven't read the books (yet) so I can't say how true to the spirit of the novels the movie is.  However, I can say MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is one good yarn worth watching on the big screen at the theatre.",1069113600,5,1363,4.6115702479338845

1864883,5,B00008W64E,"A film by Peter Weir
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is based on two of the novels of Patrick O'Brien (both Master and Commander, and The Far Side of the World, the first and tenth books of the series).  I haven't read any of the books, but any movie starring Russell Crowe and directed by Peter Weir is worth seeing.  Weir is a very talented director (Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) and Crowe is such a good actor that when he is in a role you don't see the man, you see the character.  That is rare in a leading man.  This movie (as well as the books) is historical fiction.
The captain of the H.M.S. Surprise is Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe).  Aubrey is given his orders: to pursue and capture the French ship the Acheron.  The Acheron has been harrying and sinking English whaling vessels and it is up to the Surprise to stop this.  It's a simple story and this point is where much of the plot lies: in the chase.  The rest of the movie is the development of the friendship between Aubrey, and this ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  Over the course of the film (and the long chase of the Acheron) we get to see what sailing would have been like in the 19th Century, and we see how Aubrey interacts with his crew.  He is a compassionate Captain, a moral man who leads without being a tyrant.  We see Aubrey's strong leadership with the crew and his humanity both in his leadership as well as in his friendship with Maturin.
This was an impressive movie.  Unlike The Perfect Storm, Master and Commander captures the feel of being on the ship and really working.  The use of nautical and military terms without stopping to explain each term adds to the realism of the movie.  Peter Weir has the details down and he crafts quite an experience that does not go for the cheap payoff in the chase of the Acheron.  The acting was top notch, and while the supporting cast was not very well developed (I never saw them as individuals, only as Crew) they blend seamlessly into the movie, and into the ship.  I was very impressed with this movie.  It had more of a classic film feel in the pacing and the acting, but Weir's vision was strong and I loved the movie.  Highly recommended for anyone.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.",1069113600,4,2251,4.3549160671462825
1864884,5,B00008W64E,"For months I had anticipated the coming of, ""Master and Commander, the Far Side of the World"" and this was not a movie in which I left dissappointed. Captian 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey is the Captian of the HMS Surprise, and he is the one surprised in the first battle scene, right at the start of the film.  Aubrey has the Surprise in search of the French Vessel Acheron, which  has found him, and lays into the Surprise a wallup of a battle.  Of note in the film is a young actor, Max Pirkis, who plays Lord Blakeney.  In the initial battle waged upon the Surprise, Blakeney is wounded in the arm and subsequently looses said arm.  This is a fairly dramatic scene in which his arm is amputated, a bit to close to home for me.  Pirkis' ability at the young age of 13 to act against Crowe and not be swalowed up and disappear was superb. Paul Bettany in his role as Dr. Stephen Maturin was quite brilliant, I could almost feel his child-like at at the all to brief but glorious beauty of the Galapagos Islands.  Someone wrote they thought some of the scenes looked cropped, as I am not a photographer, I could not tell, so I truly enjoyed the Islands scenes.  One of the more dramamtic scenes was seeing Bettany's Physician, after being shot and needing surgery, performs the surgery on himself, *shudder*.  All of the actors in Master and Commander fulfilled there roles with utter amazement.  You get a very good idea of the feelings that were clustered into the Man-O-Wars (ships) back then.  The ships were of close confinement and thus caused many fights, tifts, cliques and losses amongst fellow shipmates.
As I have not read the books by Patrick O'Brian, so I can not attest to how closelynthe movie morrors the books.  But I do understand from people who have told me they read the books and saw the film, there are discprepancies, but most still quite enjoyed the film.  I will admit some scenes were not quite believable, but were not so far fetched as to seem ridiculous and loose believability in the film.  Overall it was extremely enjoyable by myself and my party,one of whom is a history buff.  I believe anyone who watches ""Master and Commander"" will walk away pleased.  I also think it will give renewed interest in Napoleonic History, especially in British ships and ship warfare.",1069113600,4,2291,4.578431372549019
1864885,5,B00008W64E,"MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a movie that is almost impossible not to like. The idiosyncratic world of life aboard a ship (a man-o-war) is in many ways like viewing the universe through the wrong end of a telescope: life with all the relationships, fear, lust, camaraderie, bigotry, animal drives for survival, agony of death from the eyes of the dying and the eyes of those surviving become a microcosm of life beyond the vast stretches of sea to that on the Continents of the civilized world in the year 1805. Patrick O'Brien's epics are well served down to the last detail of grit and grime and ship etiquette as captured by director Peter Weir.
The claustrophobia of confinement aboard a ship at sea is staggeringly well depicted. The lighting, the inevitable fog, the allegiance of a crew to its Captain, the British use of young midshipmen, the close relationship between the Captain and his ship's physician (they rise above the rawness of ship life by playing duets on the violin and cello at night in the Captain's quarters), the gore of naval battles both across ships and after boarding an enemy ship - all are extraordinary. The actors are excellent - especially Paul Bethany as the physician and Russell Crowe as the Captain. The music score is utterly breathtaking as it uses Ralph Vaughn-Williams ""Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis"", Bocherini, Bach and some wonderful sea shanties to realize a very British atmosphere. The music is there when it is necessary, not merely to bolster the magnitude of the sound of noisy battle.
So why is the sum of the parts greater than the whole? For this viewer all the splendor and production values somehow bury the importance of who these men truly are. Perhaps that is Weir's (and O'Brian's) choice - that the thrust of the story should be about one ship and its crew and destiny. I wonder. This is a splendid movie and I recommend it highly. Just go for the majesty of it all.",1069027200,4,1957,4.6753623188405795
1864886,2,B00008W64E,"Great books often lose in translation, and this is no exception.  I felt that Peter Weir took several volumes of O'Brian's incredible opus, cut them to pieces, shook 'em in a basket, then pulled out random bits and duct-taped them together.  I don't see why.  Even one book could have been filmed as a miniseries.
Crowe, Bettany, et al did their best, I'm sure.  Killick was perfect.  The shipboard details were superb.  Maturin's little office looked much like the one on the Victory.  The look and sound were superb, but the plot had no shape or direction.
Trying to shove book 1 & book 10 together was as graceful as a front-end collision.  Taking chunks of story from different decades and mixing them like hash made for some really stupid bits.  Maturin wouldn't have been complaining about someone getting flogged for shoving an officer -- not after he'd been aboard for several years.  Likewise the old salt explaining to the youngster the difference between a pirate and a privateer.  This kid's been on board for months -- that would have been explained long since.  It was in character but out of sync -- as Gene Roddenberry once said, it would be like Joe Friday explaining how a pistol works.
There were breathtaking scenes:  the storm at sea, where wreckage must be cut away to save all the men aboard, but at the cost of a life.  The scenes of the ship moving quietly through the water, to the sound of the violin and cello... the heart-stopping battle scenes, with the amplified boom making the theatre rattle.  As usual these days, special effects were superb.  The actors were wonderful.  The cast gave uniformly skilled performances, and did their best with what they had to work with.
But the story ... I felt that the writers who eviscerated and reconstituted the story didn't have a clue about the heart of this remarkable series.  It will probably do well.  It has fine acting, superb cinematography, convincing battle scenes, and almost no soul at all. Book One, Master and Commander, would have made a fine film all on its own, and I can't for the life of me understand why they buggered it up so thoroughly.
I understand that O'Brian's son, who apparently inherited the rights to the books, had a lot of resentment toward his father.  It's a pity they had no one in the O'Brian estate, or in the scripting team, who had a better understanding of and love for these books.",1068940800,16,2396,4.65952380952381
1864887,4,B00008W64E,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It wasn't extraordinary or unique, but it was certainly an action-packed, high energy, tour de force entertainment. The acting was great, especially Paul Bettany's (the doctor on board the HMS Surprise.) The special effects were awesome and the sound was clear and realistic. I love the soundtrack to this movie as well.
Some scenes from the Island on which the HMS Surprise landed appeared to be superimposed, which was really embarrassing. The last battle scene was extremely disorienting to the point that you lost track of who was attacking whom.
What I really liked about the movie were the series of dialogues between Captain Jack (Russell Crowe) and Dr. Stephen (Paul Bettany). They were full of profound symbolism and uncanny relevance. I also enjoyed the numerous subtle layers the movie seemed to have. Two thumbs up to that!
I think the movie is a great movie-going experience that will satisfy your desire for colossal action sequences. It is PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN meets THE PERFECT STORM.",1068940800,,1035,5.058479532163743
1864888,4,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is a pretty good movie about naval warfare and tall ships in the early 19th century.  Russell Crowe plays Captian ""Lucky Jack"" of the British ship Surprise. The mission is to destroy the French vessel Acheron, under Napoleon's reign. In this quest, we are shown what it was like to sail tall ships and what warfare was like in the 1800s.
I haven't read Patrick O'Brien's novels, but I love the romance and excitement of seafaring adventure.  Like-minded individuals won't be disappointed, although the movie may be a bit less rough sailing than expected. The trailer to the movie shows the Surprise in the thick of battle and during very rough seas, but we needn't ask ourselves ""what happened when the sea was at a dead calm?"" We see that as well.
This movie will thrill history buffs, too, because we get to see how things were done, what it was like to sustain injury and be treated, and the daily life of being  a sailor in her majesty's royal navy.  It was a brutal way of life and that's evident in the movie, especially when you consider that the British Navy was superior to all others in the 19th century, so it's probably safe to assume that their ships and practices were the highest standard of the time.
There are many surprises in this movie-the remarkable youth of some of the sailors, how certain nautical methods and terms came to be, tactical techniques, and a very pleasant but abbreviated visit to the Galapagos Islands. But what I found most surprising was the moral slant of this movie. First of all, Captain ""Lucky Jack"" is the most benevolent of captains, a dedicated but fair and compassionate man.  There are several scenes where the captain has cause to give his men moral direction and guidance. He is deeply moved upon the tragic and sacrificial death of one of his sailors.  He asks his friend and co-star Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's doctor, ""have the men indicated to you how they are feeling?"" Would a Navy captain react that way, especially in the 19th century, with such humanity and concern for his men's emotional state?  I mean, isn't death, suffering, and loss a foregone conclusion in battle? These scenes felt to me more like a bit of modernizing than historical accuracy, but what do I know? I've never been in the navy.  The story itself is tightly focused; notice how the object of the movie is to overtake the Achelon and yet we never see what goes on with that French vessel. The story is about the men of the Surprise, and that's where our focus is kept.
Another very pleasant surprise for this music lover is Ralph Vaughan Williams ""Tallis Fantasia,"" used to great emotional effect in several key scenes.
In all, Master and Commander is definitely worth full price, if for no other reason than to see the sea at her wildest on the big screen.  These scenes will make you lean forward in your seat, secure and thankful that it isn't *you* on the ship's deck or hanging from sail ropes.  The movie felt more like an ensemble movie; if there's a star here, it's the story itself.  You won't get the emotional impact of ""A Beautiful Mind"" and it won't stick to your ribs the way that masterpiece did, but it's still a pretty good movie. If this type of movie is your idea of a good time, don't wait for the video to come out. Get the full experience. See it now.",1068940800,3,3333,4.547579298831385
1864889,5,B00008W64E,"Fans of Russell Crowe will love his newest film, MASTER AND COMMANDER.  Crowe continues his tradition of playing strong-minded characters in his role of Captain Jack Aubrey, the commander of Her Majesty's Ship, The Surprise, during the English-French war of 1805.  What director Peter Weir brings to the screen is an exciting and as astonishing a sea adventure saga that combines the best of the Horation Hornblower series with Captain Kirk from STAR TREK.  Weir captures the essence of what it must have been like to be a sailor of that time.  Part of the believability lies in Weir's portrayal of the natural elements of shipboard life: the cold, the hunger, the salt spray, the lack of women.  But what makes this film click is a series of subtexts that explores the infinitely illogical relationship between duty and frienship.  Serving as ship's doctor is Lieutenant Stephen Maturin (Peter Bettany, who played Crowe's non-existent roommate from A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  Maturin is more than just the rather youngish ship's surgeon.  He is a naturalist one generation before Darwin.  He longs to explore the unknown flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands.  Several times, Captain Aubrey promises him the opportunity to do so but each time the exigencies of war force him to do otherwise.  This clashing of wills is only but the most obvious of themes that elevate MASTER AND COMMANDER to a superior sea war film.  Director Weir further examines the delicate balancing act that any commanding officer faces when deciding just how close that officer can allow himself to be towards his crew.
The plot is straightforward and uncomplicated.  Aubrey is ordered to seek out and destroy the Acheron, a vessel that is much faster and more heavily armed than Aubrey's.  During this chase, each ship takes turns chasing the other, with the ultimate confrontation resulting in a roaringly load sea battle that seems as exciting as it was undoubtedly authentic.  There is more than a few passing references to Star Trek, especially the episode where Kirk disguises himself as a Romulan to defeat a vessel of superior technology.  MASTER AND COMMANDER seems sure to garner a few Oscars, probably for Best Picture and Best Actor.  It was truly a pleasure to see such a politically incorrect film wow the audience in a way that would have made Errol Flynn proud.",1068940800,2,2348,4.964194373401535

The great casts of characters that occupy the ship are full of great actors, including Paul Bettany

1864891,5,B00008W64E,"Prepare to be completely submerged into the historic maritime past and immersed in the epic story written by Patrick O'Brian. From the excellent costumes to the magnificent depiction of the sea and ships, from the sails unfurling in the wind, to the dark, tight spaces below deck, from the swinging hammocks, the fog, the gales, the guns, the flying debris, to the carpentry repairs, the piping bosun, the officers peering through their spyglasses, to even the flipping of the hourglass, all elements of the story are presented in masterful detail and drama.
The film itself, like the books it's based on, is a bit challenging, involving and intense. Many times during surgical operations and battle maneuvers, I was clenching my teeth and holding my breath. It does offer some mild humor but it's more of an action film with a sense of seriousness. What engages the attention nicely are some of the ingenious stratagems played out. Which keep the film from being just repetitive battle, blood and destruction, as obvious as that might later seem. But really the film presents much more than that and brings to life some truly noble characters. Touching issues in discipline, sacrifice, pride or how ""the power of authority corrupts"" regarding the call of duty. And when those who died in close combat where buried at sea, the Our Father prayer was solemnly recited, creating a poignant effect to the overall picture, though it is not a religious film in the outright.
The music takes on a different kind of importance with this film. There is the jovial type of sea chanteys sung by the shipmates, but the strategic segments of classical strings incorporated, as a strong element is likely the most powerful. Brought to life visually by the two main characters themselves. This becomes a fitting signature of the story, making the motion picture and score unique in it's own.
Like the novel by Patrick O'Brian, the nautical interest is what drew me to the film. There alone I was not disappointed, but amazingly impressed. And at some scenes I even wanted to clap for the good performance. It's an admiral achievement, giving an accurate glimpse to a maritime era in history unlike any other film.",1068940800,5,2198,4.911290322580645
1864892,4,B00008W64E,"This is a very enjoyable and realistic historical adventure film, greatly about the level of most Hollywood films.  Viewers, however, have to have clear expectations about this film.  This is not a direct translation of any of Patrick O'Brian's historical novels about Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin to the screen.  It is fairer to say that this is a historical adventure movie inspired by the Aubrey/Maturin books.  It would be impossible and totally unfair to expect reproduction of any or all of the Aubrey/Maturin books on the screen.  The movie format doesn't really allow the character development inherent in any of these outstanding novels and the constraints of a movie don't allow the range of characters and scenes possible in a novel.  The makers of this film have taken a number of episodes from the Aubrey/Maturin canon, modified and combined them into an essentially new plot.  Significant compromises have been made in the interest of dramatic intensity.  Aubrey is the center of the story with Maturin playing an important but ancillary role.  The movie necessarily lacks the depth and complexity of the books.  With these points in mind, this is an excellent movie.  The attention to period detail seems excellent.  The depictions of life aboard a Napoleonic warship and naval combat are riveting.  Some of the scenes of HMS Surprise (actually the Rose, a Canadian made contemporary reproduction of a square rigged ship) under sail are beautiful.  The director, Peter Weir, and the screenwriters made the very intelligent decision to make the ship, HMS Surprise, itself, and the crew, important characters in the story.  This is not actually novel.  In a sense, this movie is a 19th century version of an established Hollywood genre, the submarine movie.  In submarine movies, a boat, crew, and officers are pitted against a largely unseen set of enemies, very similar to the plot of this movie.  Weir and his team are careful also to introduce much of the humor that is an important component of O'Brian's books.  The quality of acting, including a literally commanding performance by Russell Crowe, is excellent.  I do feel that the script could have done a better job of reproducing the early 19th century English idioms that O'Brian features but the decision to use a more contemporary English is understandable.  I hope this film is a significant commercial success.  The screenplay clearly sets the stage for a sequel and my guess is that the screenwriting team has developed a plot outline for one or two sequels that would incorporate more of the Aubrey/Maturin saga and more completely develop the characters of Aubrey and especially Maturin.",1068940800,2,2670,5.075688073394495
1864893,5,B00008W64E,"As someone who is a lover of history, especially English, and has read all 20 Patrick O'Brian ""Captain Jack"" books, was I in my glory when I discovered last spring that Russell Crowe, my favorite actor, would be playing Captain John Aubrey with whom I am infatuated.  I cannot think of any other actor who could possibly do justice to the character of Captain ""Lucky Jack Aubrey"" (also known in his younger days as Captain ""Can't keep his pants up!"")  No one could portray as wonderfully as Crowe the complex character of Aubrey, a man of many talents and paradoxes which can be seen in the movie.
Paul Bettany, whom I thought at first was an odd choice for Dr. Stephen Maturin, Aubrey's best friend, was excellent. Crowe and Bettany were perfect together.
Peter Weir did a superb job of keeping everything historically accurate from the ship to the buttons on Jack's coat.  He has given us a taste of what life was not just at sea but through the customs, speech, and manners of that time.
I read that women may not like this film because it is an
""action"" flick.  Yes, it is with the battles at sea and no love story.  However, to see Crowe use his talent to draw the audience into the emotions of the film whether the loss of a seaman, the ferocity of battle, or the longing look he gave a native girl - well, it is totally worth it.
My 14 and 15 year old daughters accompanied me to the movie and also loved it. They laughed at the corny weevil joke, cried at the losses, and sat in suspense at what would happen next.  They thought James D'Arcy was ""hot"" and enjoyed Billy Boyd (Lord of the Rings) as Barret Bonden.
As I looked at the crowd in the theatre, I saw people of all ages
awaiting the start of the film.  At the end of the show, it appeared that everyone enjoyed the movie for one reason or another.
My 14 year old told me she liked the way the movie began.  ""They didn't splash Russell Crowe onto the screen,"" she said.  ""Have him making some big entrance.""  After thinking about this, I agree with her.  What insight she had.  The film was not one person and never could be.  It was perfectly balanced - a wonderful film to see!",1068940800,,2145,4.3325
1864894,5,B00008W64E,"""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" is one of this year's best, it is brilliant. Russell Crowe plays Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, in one of his best performances of his career, Captain of HMS Surprise. Paul Bettany plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, Surgeon on the HMS Surprise, in the best performance of his career, so far. HMS Surprise is attacked in the beginning of the movie by the Acheron, a much stronger and faster battleship. Some of Aubrey's men were wounded and some of them died. As the movie progresses, we get to learn how the characters are feel and we feel the same exact thing that the characters because of the fact is that we know and get how they feel. Aubrey gets surprised twice by the captain of the Acheron and vows there will not be a third time. Men are lost in the balance of the attack and chase to find the Acheron. Men that were good people and fought for their country very well. At the end of this movie, they set a trap on the Acheron so they won't be the ones that are surprised and this trap does work brilliantly to Aubrey's advantage. This movie is set during the era of the French Revolution, and it is quite brilliant how Peter Weir and his crew made ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" come to life so brilliantly. The acting is superb as the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany's were. The directing by Peter Weir is brilliant and superb at its finest hour. The screenplay by Weir and John Conlee is excellent without compromise. The visual effects by INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC & ASYLUM is brilliant without compromise. The costume design is dynamic and brilliant. The production design is wonderful and brilliant. The film editing is great. The cinematography (Oscar Winner) is superb and dynamic without compromise. The music is brilliant and excellent. I like this movie very much, because it was brilliantly different from the movies we have seen this year, because it doesn't go for swashbuckling at all. The Acheron is the shark from ""Jaws"". It hides and it waits for its attack to happened. This movie should get brilliant Oscar and Golden Globe coverage when the Oscar Nominations and Golden Globe Nominations are announced in the next two months or so. See this movie now or any time you can see it. You will enjoy it very much. Also won for Best Sound Editing.",1068854400,,2342,4.591885441527446
1864895,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander is not just for Patrick O'Brian fans. Anyone who enjoys action and drama will enjoy this film. It ranges from great battle scenes with the tang of salt spray to human drama. The primary plot involves a cat and mouse game, set in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars, between Captain Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) ship Surprise and his enemy a French ship Acheron.  The Acheron is by far the superior ship in speed, size, and firepower. Captain Aubrey has orders to take the Acheron, while the French seem all too aware of his orders. The chase passes around the tip of South America leaving the Atlantic and entering the Pacific Ocean where Acheron will raise money for Emperor Napoleon by raiding English whalers. The sailing is marvelously recreated.
Along for the ride we experience sailing, sea tactics, and life on board a ship of this era. The apprenticeship approach to schooling officers during the Napoleonic era placed children on board fighting vessels. We even see a brief glimpse of a lesson in navigation Captain Aubrey is giving the young midshipmen. Life in harm's way as the sea becomes a battlefield spares neither young nor old. The crowding, stale food, and mental toll that are a fact of life on vessels that are at sea for long periods of time are graphically portrayed. The mood is lightened by the exhilaration of the hunt and moments of courage, kindness, and Aubrey's penchant for terrible puns, which fans of O'Brian's books will recognize.
Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), the side kick of this famous duo, provides a counterpoint to Aubrey's sense of duty. Through him we see medicine of the period grope its way toward the future.  As an amateur naturalist, Dr. Maturin visits the Galapagos Islands much as Darwin would have during his famous trip on HMS Beagle 30 years after the 1805 date of the movie. In fact, Dr. Maturin's desire to visit the Islands becomes a source of conflict between himself and the single minded Aubrey. The resolution to the conflict is a measure of the friendship between Dr. Maturin and ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey.",1068854400,239,2083,4.848314606741573
1864896,5,B00008W64E,"Engaging, superb action. Die hard, like it really is. Crowe is the master and this movie now makes my list of best movies ever made. The code of the era comes through.

1864897,5,B00008W64E,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, was a great film, because when you enter the theater, you expect an ""on-the-surface"" action flick, but you get so much more.  The emotional depth is there and the acting just strengthens what is already strong.
The synopsis is as follows: Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) is ordered by the British government, or whoever orders around the navy, to search for a certain French ship and take them over.  What is interesting about this plot is the ship's (HMS Surprise) small size compared to the French ship's grandeur.  You always think the Surprise could never stand up against such a ship, but there are so many twists and turns externally and internally that keep you locked on the story and continuously captivated.
Peter Wier directs the film, and does a wondeful job, Oscar-worthy.  Most of the movie takes place within the Surprise, and Wier masterfully creates an intimate environment out of a small shell one would think too compact to bear so much life.  I really think this is one of the best directing jobs of the year.  Watch how he creates such a wonderful place, such a complex place, out of the ""Surprise.""
The best acting credit goes to Paul Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, the crazy roommate) for conveying such a quiet person's inner bieng and depth so beautifully.  His character always makes you smile, and always seems so fearless when it comes to standing up to his Captain.  His naturalist buddy, a small boy whose arm is amputated, and he share this relationship that Bettany elevated to a level where most anyone can go to.  It's that level of relaitionship where you'd do anything to keep the person alive, no matter what age they are, because they make you feel so complete.  The little boy is like Bettany's best friend, and also does a wonderful job for a young actor.
I have only one disclaimer, and that is to not expect there to be a naval battle at every corner, because there are long stretches of conversations and injuries that are exciting in itself, but not what one might expect.  With that said, feel free to go and indulge in the beautiful, exciting world of Patrick O'Brian's ""Master and Commander"" finally brought to the screen by Wier.
Bottom Line: Definately one of the better made movies of the year, expect a nomination for Wier and Bettany. (I give it an A)",1068768000,5,2351,4.682038834951456
1864898,3,B00008W64E,"I like big screen movies and this a big screen movie. So many movies today could be seen on TV without detracting from the movie. So why go to the movies? You go to get an experience not available in your living room. Star Wars on TV is OK, but Star Wars on the big screen with Tie fighters coming at you is an experience. In this movie, when it does things right, you feel the waves crashing into you and the wind howling around you. You shudder as another cannon ball hits. The movie doesn't do this enough however. Too much time is spent on Russell Crowe without first investing us in his character. It should either be about Russell Crowe's character or about the sea and his ship. Given the potential to be a grand big screen movie, it should have been the latter. I came away disappointed because of wasted potential.",1068768000,2,823,4.35064935064935
