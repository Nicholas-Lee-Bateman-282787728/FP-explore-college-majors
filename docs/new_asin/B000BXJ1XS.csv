2445262,5,B000BXJ1XS,"I loved this movie, the best I have seen in years. If you are in an interacial relationship I promise you that it will jerk some tears. There was some decrepancies in the timeline and war draft rules for vietnam, but if you set those aside you will love this movie. I am a white man married to a black woman and we deal with these problems everyday, so it really hits home even if it takes place 30 years ago. The summary of the movie has nothing to do with the actual screenplay, I rented this thinking it was a war movie, but it was a love story with about 10 minutes of battle scenes. I was not dissapointed in the end.",1145664000,38,622,4.065040650406504
2445263,5,B000BXJ1XS,"Wow what a pleasant surprise! A film with a great message, good acting and amazing talent. What is the most important thing in this life? This movie answers this question. The message of a fathers love is so real and so amazing in this film. The amazing sacrifice is the true sign of Love that is so evident in this film and no matter what color you are or where you are from this love can bring us all together if we let it and if we are willing to pay the price for it.",1144281600,21,471,3.968421052631579
2445264,1,B000BXJ1XS,"Historically inaccurate, utterly falacious screenplay. I think our children deserve something accurate and well done. History did not need to be re-written to make it accessible or moving. Overall, this is Hollywood Pap.",1141862400,4,220,5.696969696969697
2445265,5,B000BXJ1XS,"This is an outstanding film about a white male who falls in love with an African-American woman in the rural south during the early sixties. The two are married, only for the husband being drafted during the Vietnam War. Throughout the film, you relive the history that takes place: the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the cruel treatment of the blacks in the South. I believe this movie has been one of the best films released in some time, and yet, has not been widely acclaimed. I hope that all of you take the time to watch this movie.",1141344000,16,567,4.568627450980392
2445266,5,B000BXJ1XS,"this is a movie i can recommend with no reservations.  although i did recognize a number of cast members, the leads, almost without exception were unknown to me.  each and every one of them will hopefully go on to bigger movies.  by bigger i mean in scope as i don't think there are going to be bigger movies.  maybe in cash dollars there will be, but not in stature.  i am happy to say this movie brought tears to my eyes.  there are happy moments and very sad moments in this movie but there is also a message for anyone that wants to hear it.  this was a great movie and i enjoyed it immensely.  highly recommend, if my recommendation means anything at all.

2445267,5,B000BXJ1XS,"I began watching this film wondering if it would have anything for me or any substance, but was soon engrossed by the fine acting and the story line. Towards the end, you might begin to think it's a totally tragic tale, but the happy ending more than makes up for it; I was almost in tears! Well worth purchasing or renting!",1139875200,6,324,4.327868852459017

2445277,5,B000BXJ1XS,"It is kind of difficult to rate a movie that is so touching.  I guess you have to live and somewhat experience something like this story or at least live during this era to  appreciate it.  That being said, I will try.
This is definitely not a war action movie but there are some moments of reflection about the Viet Nam war but it is needed in order to let the viewer connect the whole movie into a single sense.  This is, without a doubt, one of the better movies I have seen in a long, long time and will remain that way.
The whole plot of the movie and base story I found were excellently produced in this movie.  An emotional and clever ending is a very important part of the movie.
The acting is very, very good and convincing.
As I said before, the viewer would appreciate this movie more if they experienced the era that this portrayed.",1482710400,5,844,4.25
2445278,4,B000BXJ1XS,"Sure, the cover is a little misleading, one would definitely be disappointed if they expected to see a war film. The movie is actually about a young man who falls in love with an African American woman and then discovers himself as activist within the civil rights movement of the 1960's. The film kept my attention despite the fact the acting was average at best and that the script needed some polishing. The plot is what made this movie very unique. It was unpredictable and surprisingly enough there were no cliches. It had a very ""feel good"" ending (don't worry I won't spoil it for you) in fact it was so good that the writers of The Longest Ride (2015) apparently felt the need to plagiarize it.",1482624000,3,702,4.535433070866142

2445309,5,B000BXJ1XS,"Not what I expected, but still worth watching. Soldiers of Change is about the Civil Rights era and what it was like to be in an interracial relationship. It shows the difficulties of being part of the upper class elite, and being able to not only empathize with the lower class but to  do all you can to help them, without the help of money.

As Hollywood also does so well, there are a few flights of fancy here and there, but from a historical perspective the story is authentic enough - ask any attorney how many marriage laws had to be changed just because of courageous interracial couples such as those fictionalized in this flick.  Overall this was a surprisingly worthy and formidable movie with above-average acting and actors, for what was doubtless a low-budget endeavor.

2445404,4,B000BXJ1XS,"This movie is not really about a soldier or any changes he undergoes. It goes much deeper than that and the person who undergoes the change is not the soldier.

The original title for this film was ""The Painting"" which is a more fitting title and which created a sense of awe and wonder as the story unfolded. Where is this painting? What is it about? What does it have to do with these people? Oh wait I know what the painting is of!... Oh crap, I was wrong, but there went my heartstrings.

Initially I decided to see this movie because it had Stacey Dash whom I've had a crush on for years. She plays a teenager in this movie and was 35 or 36 at the time. She was also in ""Clueless"" where she played a 16 year old while actually being 29.

So I sat down to watch this movie and was very pleasantly surprised by the storyline and depth of emotion that was touched within me. Set in the 1960s, this is a story about honoring your family, standing up for what you believe in, and the decisions necessary to follow your heart knowing someone is going to get hurt. Is there such a thing as too open-minded? And is there any hope of redemption for the closed-minded? Is a gap between generations inevitable or can it be bridged?

Also starring Clifton Davis as the loyal friend, confidante and employee; Charles Shaughnessy as the stalwart patriarch; Heath Freeman as the son with seemingly 2 fathers; Stacey Dash as the love interest who fuels a young man's imagination of what could be and his search for equality.

Watch this movie and see how love can fracture and heal.",1204070400,15,1571,4.384879725085911

2445406,1,B000BXJ1XS,"""Soldiers of Change"" (aka ""The Painting"")

by Bob Westal

(2002-05-22)

2002, Un-rated, 120 minutes, A Joshua D. Rose Film

The thousands of mixed-race couples brave enough to get married before the establishment of civil rights deserve a movie, but no one deserves ""The Painting."" This is the sort of film that would drive Miss Daisy to upchuck at the shenanigans of its saintly, cardboard characters and its bizarre, rose-colored depiction of U.S. race relations. ""The Painting"" starts out as a sort of wannabe Ivory-Merchant, a production of ""The Not Ready for Masterpiece Theater"" players, and then it gets weird.

Directed by Joshua Rose and written by Buddy Shieffield, with a story by David Rose and J. Marina Muhlfriedel, this is the story of the love between the white, rich and privileged Randy Barrington IV (played by Cody Dorkin at age 13, and from 18 on by Heath Freeman) and the black and somewhat less privileged Hallie Ayres (Shari Dyon Perry and Stacey Dash). The problem is, we're in the 1960s, and Randy is the son of an art-obsessed multimillionaire.

A third-generation Kansas City-born tycoon with a mysterious British accent, Randolf Barrington IV (Charles Shaughnessy, TV's ""The Nanny"") is a basically decent and broadminded man, but he ultimately draws the line at an interracial marriage. Randolf the elder is notable because he's the only person around with the slightest persistent character flaw.

The reason no one else in the movie has any flaws is that they all listen to Thomas Ayres, the Barringtons' butler and driver. Played with dignity and a touch of humor by showbiz lifer Clifton Davis (""Any Given Sunday,"" ""That's My Mama!""), Ayres is in the Sidney Poitier tradition of superhuman cinematic black men. His superpower is that every time he gives a speech, which he does as often as most people change their underwear, whoever is listening immediately realizes the error of his or her ways. (Mr. Dickson of ""Room 222"" had the same ability. Must be some kind of power-ring bequeathed by the Guardians of Oa....)

As the story progresses and the millionaire tries to keep his son away from Thomas's niece, the butler quits rather than be a party to keeping the couple apart. A whole lot of other stuff happens over the film's 105 minutes, but, despite a mostly African-American cast, most of it still happens to the white people.

Speaking of the cast, nobody - black or white - emerges unscathed. Sometimes the actors almost connect; other times, they barely seem to be listening to each other. I enjoyed seeing Ben Vereen (""Roots,"" ""All That Jazz,"" etc.), a favorite of my youth, but I didn't know what to make of his wizened blind gospel singer. He would be just another walking, talking cliche, except that also seems to be putting the moves on a teenage male civil rights worker.

Boy, but these people are ahead of their time. Yet, ""The Painting"" is the sort of sixties movie where the makers are so terrified we'll forget it's about the sixties that they feel compelled to include every historical event of the time. There will be shock and horror after the assassinations of JFK, MLK, and RFK. There will be arguments about the Vietnam war. We will hear ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" and ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida."" We will spend time with the grunts in 'Nam. Ultimately, the only thing which saves viewers of ""The Painting"" from unrelieved torture is its steadily growing shamelessness. By the film's end, the plot has taken so many turns in its desperation to make us feel something, a kind of giddiness takes over. A few tragic moments might actually threaten to cause a brief lump in the throat - but then something so absurdly contrived happens, so obviously inflicted on the characters, that all you can do is giggle.

Note to screenwriters: If you're going to create an African-American character who's a kindly, wise and compassionate servant, and people keep calling him ""Uncle,"" you might want to think through the implications of naming him ""Thomas.""",1170115200,4,3996,4.913946587537092
