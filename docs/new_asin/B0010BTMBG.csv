3048449,4,B0010BTMBG,"My five-year-old says this movie is 'a little bit more scarier than the other Barbie movies'. And she's right. She prefers to cuddle during scary scenes though, rather than to skip parts. And she was tickled at recognizing Spanish words. She did not notice that the voice for Mariposa was the same as for Nori in Mermaidia until we read it here.",1204156800,,345,4.580645161290323
3048450,4,B0010BTMBG,"My six-year-old daughter loves all the Barbie movies and this one is no exception.  We've already watched it twice and I'm sure she'll want to see it again tonight after school.

There were some intense scenes, but they didn't seem to bother her - but again, she's six, not a toddler.  And I did like the message of the film. Although I am not really enthralled with the Barbie movies like my daughter, I do have to say that, visually, this is the most spectacular of them so far.  They really have improved the computer animation for these films tremendously.",1204156800,2,560,4.57
3048451,3,B0010BTMBG,"We pre-ordered the Mariposa DVD because we like the Fairytopia series so much.

First off, its a story-within-a-story.  The first ~10 minutes and last ~5 minutes are Elina telling the story to bibble.  My girls love Elina and Bibble so they are of course happy to see them again.

The movie itself follows the Fairytopia formula very closely.  Instead of Laverna, you have Henna.  Instead of bibble, the bunny.  Instead of fungi, you have Skeezites.  Its a race against time.  Its a formula that worked very well before, and could work again.

But whats missing?  Gone are the bright uplifting moments, like the appearance of the crest of courage, the changing from fairy to mermaid and back, Bibble talking funny after eating magic berries, and other things that made the other movies more fun.  My kids react nicely to the best movies, but not this one.  There is a lot of drama, but not very much happiness to balance it out.

A bit more about the drama: Most of the Fairytopia movies are driven forward by mock drama and very plain and pale threats (a weed grabbed me, yikes!  A firebird is chasing me!  I have to hide from some bumbling Fungi, who might do very little to me!).  This works well for 3 to 5 year olds, who don't need a serious reason for the drama that older children do.  Mariposa is dramatically different: most of the action and drama in this movie is the constant fear of death.  I wish they could have been a bit more inventive.

The plot follows a similar vein:  in other Fairytopia movies, the driver of the plot was that everyone was getting sick because of laverna, that Elina then had to save mermaidia from getting sick, that if they didn't stop laverna there would be 10 years of winter.  Death was in those movies, but it wasn't laid out as the absolute reason for everything.  In Mariposa, the deal is that if the queen dies the light goes out and then everyone is in fear of death because the skeezites EAT EVERYONE.  So the fairies have to put themselves in fear of their own life, and have concerns they will die.

There is nothing wrong with death in children's films.  Its a part of life.  What I am saying is it the main concept of this film to the point that I felt that it was used as a crutch.  They could have devoted more time to something more entertaining for children, like when the fairies try to make the first blush of spring bloom in the third Fairytopia.  Something more enjoyable for them to watch.

Oh, and my 4 year old daughter said it was Nori talking, not Mariposa.  Guess they used the same voice actress but its disappointing that it was so obvious.  But, she had watched mermaidia a few days before.

Should you let your child see this movie?  Sure.  Its not awful.  They put some effort into the production and the values are admirable.  There is nothing bad in it.

But, unlike previous fairytopia movies, this one falls a bit flat.  Keep your expectations low.  My children didn't finish the movie saying 'oh wow!',  and 2 days later they are moving on to other things.  Its clear they like the other fairytopia movies better.",1204156800,16,3091,4.485611510791367
3048452,3,B0010BTMBG,"I've admired the ""you go girl"" message that Mattel has tried to instill in the Barbie movies and it's still there.  As usual, the Barbie character uses her inner strength to overcome great obstacles and prevail.  My almost 5 year old daughter has really enjoyed most of the other Barbie movies and she liked this one -- but has told me that she doesn't intend to watch it again.  As the other reviews said, we had to fast forward through the skeezites and the Henna (the villain) scenes.  I found a couple of movies ago that getting the junior novelization (a chapter book which is always released before the DVD comes out) and spending a few days reading it out loud to my daughter allowed us to talk about the scary things that Barbie is getting into and how her courage and intelligence and creativity help her through them.  I think the writers for Barbie movies must not know how young their target audience is these days.  The older girls (even 6 and 7 year olds) don't want anything to do with Barbie stuff.  So the scary Barbie movies are getting to be a tough sell, I would think.  A simple ""fill out this survey and we'll send you something free that isn't available elsewhere"" and I think the marketing group for Mattel would discover they're dealing with 3 - 5 year olds and their parents.

We both enjoyed the way that the story was told -- with Elina telling Bibble a story (the story of Mariposa).  Bibble is as big a scene stealer as ever.  With her story, Elina helps him overcome his anxiety about not fitting in with Dizzle's friends.

Another annoyance is that the voice of Barbie (Elina, Mariposa) is played by the woman who voiced the sassy Nori from Mermaidia.  It hits you as soon as the main menu comes on and you hear the greeting.  The other butterfly fairies are also sassy and I suspect someone in Mattel marketing wants this brand to resemble the new Disney Tinker Bell look and feel.

I miss the bonus movie shorts that were included on the Nutcracker and Swan Lake movies about real girls who were studying music and ballet and such.  This disk has a couple of tiresome games that work with the remote and the main movie and that's it.

When all is said and done, I wish that I had simply rented this movie.",1204070400,3,2239,4.43520782396088
3048453,4,B0010BTMBG,"We own nearly every Barbie movie and enjoy them all.  I did like this one also.  The vivid colors are beautiful.  It was the typical storyline- betrayal and then a 5 minute ""moral of the story.""  In this movie it was about how everyone matters.  The voices were odd and didn't match the characters well.  My daughter only wanted to skip the sea beast part.  She didn't mention the other bugs.  She still loved it though.",1204070400,,420,4.434210526315789
3048454,3,B0010BTMBG,"I agree with other reviews.  The skeezites are a bit scary for children and my 5yr. old and 3yr. old did talk about it, but did not ask me to fast forward through those parts.  We did however, have problems with it after purchasing yesterday.  It does not work in our machine.  My husband was able to get it to work one time yesterday and today, I can't get it to work.  It is going back to the store today.",1204070400,2,407,4.0375
3048455,2,B0010BTMBG,"I eagerly bought this movie for my four year old. We were expecting to enjoy it as we LOVED The Island Princess. We were also disappointed. The skeezites are scary and my daughter also asked me to skip those parts. The eating of the fairies wasn't necessary, and could have been done differently.  This movie will definitely be shelved for a while. That being said, the imagery and colors of the movie are beautiful, which would be the only reason we would dare to watch it again.",1204070400,19,480,4.517241379310345
3048456,3,B0010BTMBG,"My daughter waited for the latetest Barbie title, Mariposa only to be disapointed when it was released. The Butterfly Fairies are constantly being chased by creatures (Skeezites and a sea beast) which are trying to EAT them through the whole movie. There is also a Butterfly Fairy that betrays the queen and helps the Skeezites to try to eat all her friends. This is in a movie that is meant for little girls, I can't see how this was approved for release. This movie doesn't have the attributes of the other movies, it's too scary. My daughter keeps asking for us to ""skip this part"" because it's too scary. This movie only teaches our children they are too small and someone is always tryng to get them.",1203984000,27,705,4.559055118110236

3048487,5,B0010BTMBG,"Of all the Barbie movies, this one feels the closest to a really great Disney movie for me. Mariposa begins as a sort of Cinderella, being pushed around by two bossy fairies and misunderstood by everyone in Flutterfield because she loves to read and think of exploring the world outside her safe home. But when Queen Marabella is poisoned, only Mariposa can save the day--and it turns out Rayna and Rayla may have hearts of gold after all.

While some may dislike Chiara Zanni's performance as Mariposa rather than the familiar Kelly Sherdian (who voices Elina from Fairytopia in the movie), I really liked her natural performance, and she really made the character of Mariposa stand out. Credit must also by given to Nicole Oliver, who voices the wicked fairy Henna. Henna is one of the most clever Barbie villains to date--she's only defeated by a margin of two seconds, and everyone in Flutterfield adores her! Mariposa and her friends really have to work to bring her down, and it's very exciting!

The movie is also GORGEOUS to behold. Every scene and background is beautiful! Standout locations include Flutterfield itself, the Bewilderness, the Waterwhirls, the underwater realm, and especially the Cave of Reflection.

If you only watch one Barbie movie, this should be it.",1408665600,2,1281,4.9766355140186915

3048520,4,B0010BTMBG,"Mariposa is a wonderful addition to the Barbie movie series.

We see a whole different world from what we saw in Fariytopia-a world that is much more dangerous.

Mariposa is a fairy that feels like she really doesn't fit in with the other butterfly faeries.

She is treated like a servant, rather than an equal among the other faeries, & this does nothing to improve her opinion of herself.

Yet, she is the one who takes charge of the quest to find a cure to the dying queen, & in the end, shows herself worthy of respect.

I couldn't give this movie a full 5 stars, though for 2 reasons.

One is maybe personal preferences, but I have gotten so used to the voice of Kelly Sheridan as the lead character, that it was hard to accept anyone else doing it

The other was-I felt that the need to use foreign accents for the queen & her son, was unnecessary.  The storyline would have been just as good without them.

This one is a cut above because its central message, about being comfortable with oneself despite being different from others, is delineated well and is reasonably accessible to adults. All right, it's about butterfly fairies. Even so...

Mariposa is a bookish dreamer and a loner who looks beyond the confines of her world. When the queen of the fairies is poisoned, Mariposa and her companions get in adventures as they seek an antidote. On the way, they try to avoid the Skeezites, creatures that strike a good balance between being somewhat scary (they eat butterfly fairies) and rather clumsy, to mild comedic effect. The best scene takes place in the Cave of Reflections, which reveals multiple facets of each character's personality.

3048537,5,B0010BTMBG,"Hey there,
I got this movie several weeks ago due to the fact that I am an avid barbie collector and dealer. I thought it would be a good idea to know the back ground material of the dolls that I'm selling.
So like all of the Fairytopia movies before it, this is a movie about finding and celebrating some quality in your self.
In this case our star is a pretty dark pink butterfly fairy named Mariposa. She's a bit of a bookworm, and is more comfortable with her books than with people. She has a good friend, and works for the
""popular"" girls. She however feels that she doesn't really have a place in this world of her own.
She meets the handsome prince, who immdeately deines his royalty wanting her to like him for him self, not his title. Both being bookish they hit it off almost instantly.
Fast forward to the next day when the queen is in danger. The prince tells our lovely heroine that shes the only one with the guts to go out into the rest of the world and do what she needs to in order to put things right.
The in crowd girls that she works for try to take over, but when they loose the directions turn out to be completely helpless. Demonstrating that all the time she spent with her nose in a book was more valuable than any one gave her credit for, Mariposa is able to help the girls and find the way to the cure for the endangered queen.
Over all this story is a bit different from the other Fairytopia tales.
I think its geared toward a slightly older crowd, both the toys and the story. Possibly six to seven year olds instead of four to five.
It's pretty dramatic and there are some slightly scary parts to it. However it does focus on the main point of the story. That the herione is NOT a helpless damsel waiting for her white knight to ride in on a horse and  save her.
It is in fact the girls that spring the prince from the pokey so he can help THEM.
It shows that you don't have to be the in crowd, or the popular girls, to make a differnance in your world. Just being your self and giving value to who and what you are is more than enough to make you special, to make a differance.
In the end of the story, Mariposa is rewarded for her faith in her self. Given a gift so that no one will ever again not see what a special person she is.
And tho we all don't get giant sparkly wings to show the rest of the world how special we are in real life, we do get the confidence and pride to know that we don't have to be anything other than who and what we are.
So despite the drama, and the suspsense. I think this is a good movie for young girls. It shows that you don't have to fit in to be something great. Indeed it does convey the message, ""The most beautiful thing you can be, Is your self.""",1236124800,,2718,4.06145251396648

3048539,3,B0010BTMBG,"While Mariposa is probably the best of the Barbie Fairytopia series, it's certainly not the best of the Barbie films overall, and in fact is one that I love to hate at times. The first thing that threw me off was Kelly Sheridan not being in the lead role, but rather was the ""bad"" fairy. I only found this annoying, but young children might find this confusing, and it's not the last of things that might be a bit troublesome for kids.

The fear of the dark that so many kids have is exploited in the movie with fairies only being safe in the light from the little bug-like skeezites, which kids may find scary by themselves. I have to wonder if this won't exacerbate the fear of the dark problem with some kids. The characters also seemed to dive right into eating strange plants without a second thought. Little ones who can't keep from putting things in their mouths could be confused the next time you tell them not to eat something bad. It might be a good idea to watch with them the first time around and point out some things to keep them  on the right track if they're particularly sensitive.

On a much more serious note, there were only two black characters in this movie; one was a guard, and the other is the butler-- really!  I'd rather them not include something like this at all than to portray the only black characters as servants-- and not very bright ones at that. All the other characters seem to be light-skinned. While a lack of diversity in these movies seems to be a common complaint, I found it particularly irksome in a movie that really should have and could have had more of a variety of skintones in it. Because so many of the characters seemed to have Spanish accents, it's really inexcusable, especially considering the wide variety of Spanish-speaking people throughout the world.

That said, *most* kids should not have major problems with anything in the story, and the issue with the dark-skinned characters will probably fly right over their heads-- no pun intended. Mariposa is much more colorful than Barbie movies in the main series (Princess and the Pauper, Rapunzel, etc.) and with all the movement, light and sparkle it will certainly entertain, even though it lacks the music and overall production quality of the main films. Kids will like it, but adults will probably not be as enthralled with it as with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-As-The-Princess-and-the-Pauper/dp/B0002CHJZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie As The Princess and the Pauper</a>, or the other non-fairy Barbie movies.

3048546,4,B0010BTMBG,"This fourth offering in Mattel's series of ""Fairytopia"" Barbie films continues the trend towards ever more beautiful animation, has a very similar plot, and introduces a new heroine. As with every previous ""Barbie"" video, my six year old daughter absolutely loves it and has watched it many times. As he has now reached the age where he doesn't think he's supposed to enjoy ""girlie"" things, her twin brother pretends not to like it, but he seems to find his way into the family TV room and sit down to watch a remarkably high proportion of the time when this film is playing.

For reference, this is the fourth in the ""Fairytopia"" sequence which currently consists of:

Fairytopia
Mermaidia
Magic of the Rainbow.
Mariposa and her Butterfly fairy friends

The film is bookended by Elena, the heroine of the first three ""Fairytopia"" films, who is telling her puffball companion Bibble the story of her friend Mariposa and how she had the courage both to overcome a threat to the fairy realm and persuade other fairies who at first did not take her seriously to do so.

As with all the Barbie films, the story is relentlessly positive and aims to encourage the viewer to strive to achieve everything she is capable of. To a greater extent than some, Mariposa also has a number of second level jokes designed to provide some amusement to mums and dads who are watching the film with their daughters.

Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.

Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including all four ""Fairytopia"" films, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before watching any of them. These films have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several - but sadly not this one - also introduced my children to some truly wonderful music.

On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""The Magic Flute"", and little girl has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)

I was a little disappointed that the last three of four Barbie films, including ""Mariposa"" did not continue this tradition: no great classics this time. This film introduces a new composer: musical scores for all the previous Barbie films had been written by Arnie Roth, who was brilliant at arranging the classics and who ranged from competent to good as a composer in his own right. Music for ""Mariposa and her butterfly fairy friends"" was written by Eric Colvin: it doesn't come up to the standards of Mozart, Mendelsohn or Beethoven as adapted by Arnie Roth, but is nevertheless quite easy on the ear.

The animation and backgrounds are quite stunningly beautiful: the last few Barbie films seem to get more visually beautiful each time and tbhis one continues that tradition.

There are a few extras on the DVD including some games involving dressing fairies for a ball at the fairy palace which my daughter enjoyed playing.

Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.

And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my own daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality. And after all, the characters in this story are fairies, complete with wings! However, if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy female body shape is, it is not quite impossible that this film may contribute to it.

But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are still a few more sophisticated jokes thrown in, so you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring.

Overall this is not, in my opinion, quite as good as some of the previous Barbie videos, including the first two Fairytopia"" titles, but anything which can hold my children's attention as well as this film did clearly has something going for it.",1211068800,,4891,4.772781065088758

 This one is not an exception, it fully met my expectations. The animation is still not very remarkable, but comparing to previous ones - it's getting better. And, as usually, beautiful.
The plot... well, I liked it. Perhaps, that's because I watched mariposa before I saw the 1st Fairytopia. Yes, I must admit there's nothing new and original, these two stories are alike: the queen is ill, poisoned bu some evil girl (Laverna\Henna) and main characters  have to save her. But looks like with Mariposa the movie makers corrected some mistakes they made in Fairytopia, so in general that's better.
It seemed to me that Chiara Zahn's voice was not quite suitable for Mariposa - it was OK for sassy Nori or Dahlia, but here sometimes it sounds too boyish. They could have found someone else to voice her.
But in general that's OK.
The only character who truly annoys me is Zinzy. Well, maybe little girls like Zinzy, maybe they find him cute, and that't OK because little girls are the general audience of this movie. But as for me - in fairytopia, Bibble was quite remarkable and funny, but this one is not funny, just over-sugary and silly.

In general, one of those things I like the most about Barbie fairy movies is that there's no love in them. There are no princes saving helpless princesses and marrying them then, but brave girls saving the world.",1205798400,2,1554,4.602888086642599
3048564,5,B0010BTMBG,My daughter didn't think this movie was scary at all-it is her new favorite Barbie movie.  The bad guys in it aren't terribly scary-they're portrayed a little bit on the silly side-kind of like the giant in Magic of Pegasus.  The animation is beautiful and the story is cute.  I'd recommend it despite all the bad reviews.,1205798400,3,322,4.614035087719298
3048565,1,B0010BTMBG,"I haven't seen this movie, but I have seen the title. The audacity of Mattel to give their title character a Spanish name (mariposa means butterfly), and still make her yet again a blonde Caucasian is unbelievable. What kind of message is Mattel giving to the thousands upon thousands of Hispanic girls who buy their products? That their language is good enough to supply a name, but God forbid the title character actually be a Latina?",1205539200,,436,4.75
3048566,5,B0010BTMBG,"This is my first review.  I'm compelled to because of my 4 year old daughter's fantasy inspired play thanks to this movie.  It's about an academically inclined butterfly fairy who finds her confidence through her acquired knowledge.  This knowledge becomes recognized by others, old friends, new friends, and employers who promote Mariposa to a position of leadership and trust through which she finds her own voice eliminating self doubt.

This is a great movie.

3048567,5,B0010BTMBG,"We have all of Barbie's movies, and this one is just as much a favorite as all of the others have been.  Some of Barbie's movies have fewer scarey parts, but i have found that all of them have some sort of villian.  And through the years my daughter has sometimes asked me to skip them, just as she does with some Disney movies.  She's 5 now, and though she was a little uneasy with the skeezites at first, with my reassurance and me helping her make fun of them, she is fine.  We are very partial to Barbie movies, because, as another reviewer put it, Barbie is always depicted as a strong character who stands up for herself and has an unwavering goodness.  The stories all have good messages and are beautiful to watch, and many have lovely songs.  If you haven't seen the other Barbie movies, I would highly recommend all of them.  They are delightful.  I would also recommend the soundtrack to The Princess and the Pauper.  Oh yes, if you can find a copy of the CD-Rom for Rapunzel.  It is amazingly fun!  I am happy to sit for long periods playing with her, though it is quite simple enough for her to do it herself.

I have seen all the Barbie movies except the Pegasus one.  I was so excited that Mariposa was finally out, but thankfully I rented it instead of bought it.  I think they are getting better w/ the animation.  I don't know why Mariposa had to receive glittered wings in the end, don't get me wrong I love glitter anything, but she has the prettiest wings, in my opinion they were better then everyone elses, they looked like beautiful stained glass.  Anyway, the fish that tried to eat them was kinda freaky and ugly and I don't like that the fish or those other things tried to eat the fairies, why did they have to make villains like that?  Nobody needs to be eaten!  The story is not bad and the lesson that u learn from the movie is the best part.  The lesson alone makes this great for little girls to see.  But it still doesn't even come close to being as good as Princess & The Pauper, 12 Dancing Princess, Fairytopia & The Island Princess.

Brilliant!!  Where do these great minds come from with these great ideas?!?  If you haven't bought it, don't.  If you have, demand your money back if you are remotely disgusted at your young daughters watching this.  Plain and simple...they shouldn't be watching.  Play a game with your child or something instead.  I'm sure you will get raver reviews than this movie from your kid.  FYI - this movie is NOT RATED!  Wonder why?????  And for those of you who ~value the music and colors in the movie~ here's an idea for you.  Buy some good ole classic orchestra/symphony CDs and play them at the same time your coloring pictures in brilliant color schemes with your child.  MUCH BETTER!  Get with it people.

So I can't compare it to the other ones (which I personally don't care about since I came here to read reviews about THIS movie only).  We really enjoyed this.  I'm surprised so many children are that scared at the ""scary"" parts of this movie...the bad goblin guys (forget the names) are pretty funny...yes, their goal is to eat butterfly fairies but they never really get that close and it made my daughter laugh to watch their bumbling.  Even at the ""scariest"" parts, all she did was hold her breath for a second or 2, but at this point, she has come to realize that in any movie like this the ending will be a happy one.  If I'm ever worried she hasn't gotten that point, I make sure I tell her and she's fine.  Without an antagonist, what would make any of these movies interesting?  The storyline is cute and we found it easy to follow (although after only 1 viewing, yeah, it's a bit hard to recall all of the character's names).  I liked that they included some Latin characters, although the main charcter, Mariposa, didn't sound Latina at all...I thought that wasn't very accurate, especially with the name ""Mariposa"".  I haven't let my daughter watch any of the Barbie movies because I figured they'd be very superficial about beauty, etc. but this had a nice storyline about believing in yourself and having confidence.  The 2 characters who ARE superficial end up seeing the error of their ways, and the lead female character saves the day.  Really, what more can you expect from a fairy movie?  And I wasn't bothered at all that this wasn't ""Barbie"" herself but her friend - who thought this wasn't about Mariposa?  That's the title of the movie!  After seeing this, I feel much better about letting my daughter watch other Barbie movies.  And if all of the people who compared this movie to the others are right (that it's very similar) then good...because we LIKED this one!",1204416000,5,1948,4.573487031700288
3048572,2,B0010BTMBG,"I have to say I was disappointed with this movie. This ""storyline"" if you want to call it that was almost identical to that in Fairytopia. There were way too many characters for a young girl to keep track of and the story just goes on and on with some ridiculous  ""plot"" of good fairy vs. evil fairy. The evil fairy who.... guess what?? put the Queen fairy to sleep with a magic flower.. isn't that what happened in Fairytopia???? Anyway  in a word I rate this: BORING and really not appropriate for young children as it is scary and confusing to follow.

My daughters still enjoy Barbie and the Barbie movies, so the one reviewer who stated that Barbie is only for 3-5 year olds is not correct.  Could this movie scare younger girls, yes, but not any worse than Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, or the Little Mermaid.  My girls and my boys both enjoyed this movie.

We usually end up buying these movies on the first day they came out and watching them over and over until the next ""new"" one -- this one, however, is a little too scary, and the story is basically recycled from older Barbie movies. Elina only shows up for a little while, even though she's on the cover. There are no songs that I can remember, and the whole thing just seemed rushed.",1204243200,7,637,4.696428571428571

There were some intense scenes, but they didn't seem to bother her - but again, she's six, not a toddler.  And I did like the message of the film. Although I am not really enthralled with the Barbie movies like my daughter, I do have to say that, visually, this is the most spectacular of them so far.  They really have improved the computer animation for these films tremendously.",1204156800,2,560,4.57
3282948,3,B0010BTMBG,"We pre-ordered the Mariposa DVD because we like the Fairytopia series so much.

First off, its a story-within-a-story.  The first ~10 minutes and last ~5 minutes are Elina telling the story to bibble.  My girls love Elina and Bibble so they are of course happy to see them again.

The movie itself follows the Fairytopia formula very closely.  Instead of Laverna, you have Henna.  Instead of bibble, the bunny.  Instead of fungi, you have Skeezites.  Its a race against time.  Its a formula that worked very well before, and could work again.

But whats missing?  Gone are the bright uplifting moments, like the appearance of the crest of courage, the changing from fairy to mermaid and back, Bibble talking funny after eating magic berries, and other things that made the other movies more fun.  My kids react nicely to the best movies, but not this one.  There is a lot of drama, but not very much happiness to balance it out.

A bit more about the drama: Most of the Fairytopia movies are driven forward by mock drama and very plain and pale threats (a weed grabbed me, yikes!  A firebird is chasing me!  I have to hide from some bumbling Fungi, who might do very little to me!).  This works well for 3 to 5 year olds, who don't need a serious reason for the drama that older children do.  Mariposa is dramatically different: most of the action and drama in this movie is the constant fear of death.  I wish they could have been a bit more inventive.

The plot follows a similar vein:  in other Fairytopia movies, the driver of the plot was that everyone was getting sick because of laverna, that Elina then had to save mermaidia from getting sick, that if they didn't stop laverna there would be 10 years of winter.  Death was in those movies, but it wasn't laid out as the absolute reason for everything.  In Mariposa, the deal is that if the queen dies the light goes out and then everyone is in fear of death because the skeezites EAT EVERYONE.  So the fairies have to put themselves in fear of their own life, and have concerns they will die.

There is nothing wrong with death in children's films.  Its a part of life.  What I am saying is it the main concept of this film to the point that I felt that it was used as a crutch.  They could have devoted more time to something more entertaining for children, like when the fairies try to make the first blush of spring bloom in the third Fairytopia.  Something more enjoyable for them to watch.

Oh, and my 4 year old daughter said it was Nori talking, not Mariposa.  Guess they used the same voice actress but its disappointing that it was so obvious.  But, she had watched mermaidia a few days before.

Should you let your child see this movie?  Sure.  Its not awful.  They put some effort into the production and the values are admirable.  There is nothing bad in it.

But, unlike previous fairytopia movies, this one falls a bit flat.  Keep your expectations low.  My children didn't finish the movie saying 'oh wow!',  and 2 days later they are moving on to other things.  Its clear they like the other fairytopia movies better.",1204156800,16,3091,4.485611510791367
3282949,3,B0010BTMBG,"I've admired the ""you go girl"" message that Mattel has tried to instill in the Barbie movies and it's still there.  As usual, the Barbie character uses her inner strength to overcome great obstacles and prevail.  My almost 5 year old daughter has really enjoyed most of the other Barbie movies and she liked this one -- but has told me that she doesn't intend to watch it again.  As the other reviews said, we had to fast forward through the skeezites and the Henna (the villain) scenes.  I found a couple of movies ago that getting the junior novelization (a chapter book which is always released before the DVD comes out) and spending a few days reading it out loud to my daughter allowed us to talk about the scary things that Barbie is getting into and how her courage and intelligence and creativity help her through them.  I think the writers for Barbie movies must not know how young their target audience is these days.  The older girls (even 6 and 7 year olds) don't want anything to do with Barbie stuff.  So the scary Barbie movies are getting to be a tough sell, I would think.  A simple ""fill out this survey and we'll send you something free that isn't available elsewhere"" and I think the marketing group for Mattel would discover they're dealing with 3 - 5 year olds and their parents.

We both enjoyed the way that the story was told -- with Elina telling Bibble a story (the story of Mariposa).  Bibble is as big a scene stealer as ever.  With her story, Elina helps him overcome his anxiety about not fitting in with Dizzle's friends.

Another annoyance is that the voice of Barbie (Elina, Mariposa) is played by the woman who voiced the sassy Nori from Mermaidia.  It hits you as soon as the main menu comes on and you hear the greeting.  The other butterfly fairies are also sassy and I suspect someone in Mattel marketing wants this brand to resemble the new Disney Tinker Bell look and feel.

I miss the bonus movie shorts that were included on the Nutcracker and Swan Lake movies about real girls who were studying music and ballet and such.  This disk has a couple of tiresome games that work with the remote and the main movie and that's it.

When all is said and done, I wish that I had simply rented this movie.",1204070400,3,2239,4.43520782396088

Mariposa begins as a sort of Cinderella, being pushed around by two bossy fairies and misunderstood by everyone in Flutterfield because she loves to read and think of exploring the world outside her safe home. But when Queen Marabella is poisoned, only Mariposa can save the day--and it turns out Rayna and Rayla may have hearts of gold after all.

While some may dislike Chiara Zanni's performance as Mariposa rather than the familiar Kelly Sherdian (who voices Elina from Fairytopia in the movie), I really liked her natural performance, and she really made the character of Mariposa stand out. Credit must also by given to Nicole Oliver, who voices the wicked fairy Henna. Henna is one of the most clever Barbie villains to date--she's only defeated by a margin of two seconds, and everyone in Flutterfield adores her! Mariposa and her friends really have to work to bring her down, and it's very exciting!

The movie is also GORGEOUS to behold. Every scene and background is beautiful! Standout locations include Flutterfield itself, the Bewilderness, the Waterwhirls, the underwater realm, and especially the Cave of Reflection.

3283017,4,B0010BTMBG,"Mariposa is a wonderful addition to the Barbie movie series.

We see a whole different world from what we saw in Fariytopia-a world that is much more dangerous.

Mariposa is a fairy that feels like she really doesn't fit in with the other butterfly faeries.

She is treated like a servant, rather than an equal among the other faeries, & this does nothing to improve her opinion of herself.

Yet, she is the one who takes charge of the quest to find a cure to the dying queen, & in the end, shows herself worthy of respect.

I couldn't give this movie a full 5 stars, though for 2 reasons.

One is maybe personal preferences, but I have gotten so used to the voice of Kelly Sheridan as the lead character, that it was hard to accept anyone else doing it

The other was-I felt that the need to use foreign accents for the queen & her son, was unnecessary.  The storyline would have been just as good without them.

The songs are well done.  The graphics are great and colorful.  Quality is excellent.  There isn't the depth of a complex cartoon like Star Wars or Pocahontis but the audience is 2-8 year olds and we don't need box office numbers or drama for success.  They are perfect the way they are.

My daughter's favorite movies of the series include the Mariposa one and a couple others.  And, for my 6 and 8 year old nieces, I sent this one as their first introduction to the Barbie movies.

Also - something didn't ring quite right with the accents. And the characters spoke as you would expect them too - that is - they reformed to stereotype.

3283030,4,B0010BTMBG,"The Barbie computer-animated movies are generally decent entertainment for kids, essentially benign given that they ""anchor"" merchandising tie-ins, but not especially great. This one is a cut above because its central message, about being comfortable with oneself despite being different from others, is delineated well and is reasonably accessible to adults. All right, it's about butterfly fairies. Even so...

Mariposa is a bookish dreamer and a loner who looks beyond the confines of her world. When the queen of the fairies is poisoned, Mariposa and her companions get in adventures as they seek an antidote. On the way, they try to avoid the Skeezites, creatures that strike a good balance between being somewhat scary (they eat butterfly fairies) and rather clumsy, to mild comedic effect. The best scene takes place in the Cave of Reflections, which reveals multiple facets of each character's personality.

At time of writing, my daughters are 6 and 5 years old. They are consistently engaged by this movie after multiple viewings, and I've sat through it more than once myself. That's a good indicator for any family entertainment.",1244160000,,1141,5.263736263736264

3283034,5,B0010BTMBG,"Hey there,
I got this movie several weeks ago due to the fact that I am an avid barbie collector and dealer. I thought it would be a good idea to know the back ground material of the dolls that I'm selling.
So like all of the Fairytopia movies before it, this is a movie about finding and celebrating some quality in your self.
In this case our star is a pretty dark pink butterfly fairy named Mariposa. She's a bit of a bookworm, and is more comfortable with her books than with people. She has a good friend, and works for the
""popular"" girls. She however feels that she doesn't really have a place in this world of her own.
She meets the handsome prince, who immdeately deines his royalty wanting her to like him for him self, not his title. Both being bookish they hit it off almost instantly.
Fast forward to the next day when the queen is in danger. The prince tells our lovely heroine that shes the only one with the guts to go out into the rest of the world and do what she needs to in order to put things right.
The in crowd girls that she works for try to take over, but when they loose the directions turn out to be completely helpless. Demonstrating that all the time she spent with her nose in a book was more valuable than any one gave her credit for, Mariposa is able to help the girls and find the way to the cure for the endangered queen.
Over all this story is a bit different from the other Fairytopia tales.
I think its geared toward a slightly older crowd, both the toys and the story. Possibly six to seven year olds instead of four to five.
It's pretty dramatic and there are some slightly scary parts to it. However it does focus on the main point of the story. That the herione is NOT a helpless damsel waiting for her white knight to ride in on a horse and  save her.
It is in fact the girls that spring the prince from the pokey so he can help THEM.
It shows that you don't have to be the in crowd, or the popular girls, to make a differnance in your world. Just being your self and giving value to who and what you are is more than enough to make you special, to make a differance.
In the end of the story, Mariposa is rewarded for her faith in her self. Given a gift so that no one will ever again not see what a special person she is.
And tho we all don't get giant sparkly wings to show the rest of the world how special we are in real life, we do get the confidence and pride to know that we don't have to be anything other than who and what we are.
So despite the drama, and the suspsense. I think this is a good movie for young girls. It shows that you don't have to fit in to be something great. Indeed it does convey the message, ""The most beautiful thing you can be, Is your self.""",1236124800,,2718,4.06145251396648

3283036,3,B0010BTMBG,"While Mariposa is probably the best of the Barbie Fairytopia series, it's certainly not the best of the Barbie films overall, and in fact is one that I love to hate at times. The first thing that threw me off was Kelly Sheridan not being in the lead role, but rather was the ""bad"" fairy. I only found this annoying, but young children might find this confusing, and it's not the last of things that might be a bit troublesome for kids.

The fear of the dark that so many kids have is exploited in the movie with fairies only being safe in the light from the little bug-like skeezites, which kids may find scary by themselves. I have to wonder if this won't exacerbate the fear of the dark problem with some kids. The characters also seemed to dive right into eating strange plants without a second thought. Little ones who can't keep from putting things in their mouths could be confused the next time you tell them not to eat something bad. It might be a good idea to watch with them the first time around and point out some things to keep them  on the right track if they're particularly sensitive.

On a much more serious note, there were only two black characters in this movie; one was a guard, and the other is the butler-- really!  I'd rather them not include something like this at all than to portray the only black characters as servants-- and not very bright ones at that. All the other characters seem to be light-skinned. While a lack of diversity in these movies seems to be a common complaint, I found it particularly irksome in a movie that really should have and could have had more of a variety of skintones in it. Because so many of the characters seemed to have Spanish accents, it's really inexcusable, especially considering the wide variety of Spanish-speaking people throughout the world.

That said, *most* kids should not have major problems with anything in the story, and the issue with the dark-skinned characters will probably fly right over their heads-- no pun intended. Mariposa is much more colorful than Barbie movies in the main series (Princess and the Pauper, Rapunzel, etc.) and with all the movement, light and sparkle it will certainly entertain, even though it lacks the music and overall production quality of the main films. Kids will like it, but adults will probably not be as enthralled with it as with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-As-The-Princess-and-the-Pauper/dp/B0002CHJZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie As The Princess and the Pauper</a>, or the other non-fairy Barbie movies.

It is by far the best movie from the fairytopia line, but does not hold a candle to the other Barbie movies.  It has a good lesson for all girls, especially those that do not fit into the norm.

And yes, being a parent fan of the franchise (meaning, no, I wouldn't watch these normally, but my daughter loves them), I miss Kelly Sheridan's voice in the lead role.

That said, hardly any child is going to notice or care about such adult ""gripes"", but we DO end up watching these too, so it would be nice if we got to be entertained at least to the level we've come to expect, with movies like Magic of Pegasus, or Princess and the Pauper.

3283043,4,B0010BTMBG,"This fourth offering in Mattel's series of ""Fairytopia"" Barbie films continues the trend towards ever more beautiful animation, has a very similar plot, and introduces a new heroine. As with every previous ""Barbie"" video, my six year old daughter absolutely loves it and has watched it many times. As he has now reached the age where he doesn't think he's supposed to enjoy ""girlie"" things, her twin brother pretends not to like it, but he seems to find his way into the family TV room and sit down to watch a remarkably high proportion of the time when this film is playing.

For reference, this is the fourth in the ""Fairytopia"" sequence which currently consists of:

Fairytopia
Mermaidia
Magic of the Rainbow.
Mariposa and her Butterfly fairy friends

The film is bookended by Elena, the heroine of the first three ""Fairytopia"" films, who is telling her puffball companion Bibble the story of her friend Mariposa and how she had the courage both to overcome a threat to the fairy realm and persuade other fairies who at first did not take her seriously to do so.

As with all the Barbie films, the story is relentlessly positive and aims to encourage the viewer to strive to achieve everything she is capable of. To a greater extent than some, Mariposa also has a number of second level jokes designed to provide some amusement to mums and dads who are watching the film with their daughters.

Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.

Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including all four ""Fairytopia"" films, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before watching any of them. These films have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several - but sadly not this one - also introduced my children to some truly wonderful music.

On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""The Magic Flute"", and little girl has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)

I was a little disappointed that the last three of four Barbie films, including ""Mariposa"" did not continue this tradition: no great classics this time. This film introduces a new composer: musical scores for all the previous Barbie films had been written by Arnie Roth, who was brilliant at arranging the classics and who ranged from competent to good as a composer in his own right. Music for ""Mariposa and her butterfly fairy friends"" was written by Eric Colvin: it doesn't come up to the standards of Mozart, Mendelsohn or Beethoven as adapted by Arnie Roth, but is nevertheless quite easy on the ear.

The animation and backgrounds are quite stunningly beautiful: the last few Barbie films seem to get more visually beautiful each time and tbhis one continues that tradition.

There are a few extras on the DVD including some games involving dressing fairies for a ball at the fairy palace which my daughter enjoyed playing.

Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.

And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my own daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality. And after all, the characters in this story are fairies, complete with wings! However, if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy female body shape is, it is not quite impossible that this film may contribute to it.

But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are still a few more sophisticated jokes thrown in, so you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring.

Overall this is not, in my opinion, quite as good as some of the previous Barbie videos, including the first two Fairytopia"" titles, but anything which can hold my children's attention as well as this film did clearly has something going for it.",1211068800,,4891,4.772781065088758

You won't hear a single, ""Shut Up!"" in any of them, which is in every modern Disney movie we own (40ish). In addition, all the Barbie movies portray the main character (Barbie as...) a strong, self-confident, eager-to-learn, young woman. She's always driven to push her abilities to help others in need. Even though she doubts her capabilities--because she's never done this thing--she's determined and doesn't give up. And she never boosts of her accomplishments or special skills. And let's face it, every movie has to have a villain. Whether it's Cruella, Zurg, Doc Oc, Davy Jones, or the Wicked Witch of the West, that's part of the plot of every ""good triumphing over evil"" movie ever made. And these super-unrealistic villains are great teaching tools in explaining unacceptable behaviors to my children.",1205971200,2,940,4.955696202531645

 This one is not an exception, it fully met my expectations. The animation is still not very remarkable, but comparing to previous ones - it's getting better. And, as usually, beautiful.
The plot... well, I liked it. Perhaps, that's because I watched mariposa before I saw the 1st Fairytopia. Yes, I must admit there's nothing new and original, these two stories are alike: the queen is ill, poisoned bu some evil girl (Laverna\Henna) and main characters  have to save her. But looks like with Mariposa the movie makers corrected some mistakes they made in Fairytopia, so in general that's better.
It seemed to me that Chiara Zahn's voice was not quite suitable for Mariposa - it was OK for sassy Nori or Dahlia, but here sometimes it sounds too boyish. They could have found someone else to voice her.
But in general that's OK.
The only character who truly annoys me is Zinzy. Well, maybe little girls like Zinzy, maybe they find him cute, and that't OK because little girls are the general audience of this movie. But as for me - in fairytopia, Bibble was quite remarkable and funny, but this one is not funny, just over-sugary and silly.

In general, one of those things I like the most about Barbie fairy movies is that there's no love in them. There are no princes saving helpless princesses and marrying them then, but brave girls saving the world.",1205798400,2,1554,4.602888086642599

It's about an academically inclined butterfly fairy who finds her confidence through her acquired knowledge.

This is a great movie.

Some of Barbie's movies have fewer scarey parts, but i have found that all of them have some sort of villian.  And through the years my daughter has sometimes asked me to skip them, just as she does with some Disney movies.  She's 5 now, and though she was a little uneasy with the skeezites at first, with my reassurance and me helping her make fun of them, she is fine.  We are very partial to Barbie movies, because, as another reviewer put it, Barbie is always depicted as a strong character who stands up for herself and has an unwavering goodness.  The stories all have good messages and are beautiful to watch, and many have lovely songs.  If you haven't seen the other Barbie movies, I would highly recommend all of them.  They are delightful.  I would also recommend the soundtrack to The Princess and the Pauper.  Oh yes, if you can find a copy of the CD-Rom for Rapunzel.  It is amazingly fun!

I have seen all the Barbie movies except the Pegasus one.  I was so excited that Mariposa was finally out, but thankfully I rented it instead of bought it.  I think they are getting better w/ the animation.  I don't know why Mariposa had to receive glittered wings in the end, don't get me wrong I love glitter anything, but she has the prettiest wings, in my opinion they were better then everyone elses, they looked like beautiful stained glass.  Anyway, the fish that tried to eat them was kinda freaky and ugly and I don't like that the fish or those other things tried to eat the fairies, why did they have to make villains like that?  Nobody needs to be eaten!  The story is not bad and the lesson that u learn from the movie is the best part.  The lesson alone makes this great for little girls to see.

So I can't compare it to the other ones (which I personally don't care about since I came here to read reviews about THIS movie only).  We really enjoyed this.  I'm surprised so many children are that scared at the ""scary"" parts of this movie...the bad goblin guys (forget the names) are pretty funny...yes, their goal is to eat butterfly fairies but they never really get that close and it made my daughter laugh to watch their bumbling.  Even at the ""scariest"" parts, all she did was hold her breath for a second or 2, but at this point, she has come to realize that in any movie like this the ending will be a happy one.  If I'm ever worried she hasn't gotten that point, I make sure I tell her and she's fine.  Without an antagonist, what would make any of these movies interesting?  The storyline is cute and we found it easy to follow (although after only 1 viewing, yeah, it's a bit hard to recall all of the character's names).  I liked that they included some Latin characters, although the main charcter, Mariposa, didn't sound Latina at all...I thought that wasn't very accurate, especially with the name ""Mariposa"".  I haven't let my daughter watch any of the Barbie movies because I figured they'd be very superficial about beauty, etc. but this had a nice storyline about believing in yourself and having confidence.  The 2 characters who ARE superficial end up seeing the error of their ways, and the lead female character saves the day.  Really, what more can you expect from a fairy movie?  And I wasn't bothered at all that this wasn't ""Barbie"" herself but her friend - who thought this wasn't about Mariposa?  That's the title of the movie!
