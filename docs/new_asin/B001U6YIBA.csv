3796797,4,B001U6YIBA,"Ben Kane (Robert Mitchum) has been cleaning up bad towns for over 20 years, but for the last decade or so one longing has possessed him: to catch up with the man named Boone who murdered his teenage son in Dodge City.  Arriving in Bisbee, Arizona, to inquire about a lawman's position, he's told that it's basically what he considers ""a boy's job""--the town of Lordsburg, which is in Bisbee's district, is plagued by ""trouble and a year's worth of back taxes.""  But when he learns that the trouble is caused by Boone (John Anderson), he changes his mind.  Meanwhile, the youthful gunslinger Billy Young (Robert Walker), fresh from a gun job in Mexico where he was abandoned to escape on his own by Boone's son Jesse (David Carradine), crosses Kane's path and, through a series of unexpected events, they become on-again-off-again allies.  Their relationship is rocky to say the least--each one lays the other out once or twice--yet Billy soon finds himself looking up to Kane and unwilling to allow him to use Jesse as a pawn in his quest to avenge his own son's death.  Kane has also met Lily Beloit (Angie Dickinson, who also appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rio-Bravo-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000O599WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rio Bravo (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which was later remade as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Dorado/dp/6305754969/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Dorado</a>, in which Mitchum starred with John Wayne), the saloon dancer who is the mistress of Boone's ally, saloonowner John Behan (Jack Kelly), while Billy finds himself attracted to--and defending Kane to--Evvie Cushman (Deana Martin), the daughter of Lordsburg's doctor.  A sudden siege of the jail brings the two unlikely allies together again and is broken with the aid of Kane's old friend, stagecoach driver Charlie (Paul Fix).

It might have benefited from a bit more exposition in the script (why has it taken Kane so long to find out where Boone went after Dodge?  Was Lordsburg always Boone's headquarters, and was he always a power there?), and Lily's assertion that no ""decent"" man would want her after her years in saloons rings a little false to me (in the West, women as well as men were judged less on their pasts than on what they were and did in the present), but it offers a good if prickly ""buddy"" relationship (I've always liked ""buddy"" films), humor, and action, and it moves along quickly and enjoyably.  It definitely deserves to be better known.",1268438400,4,4055,6.303249097472924
3796798,4,B001U6YIBA,"The screenplay was written by Burt Kennedy based upon the western novel WHO RIDES WITH WYATT? by Will Henry (or Clay Fisher, real name Henry Wilson Allen). Movie was also released under the title Who Rides With Kane?  The theme song is sung by Robert Mitchum before, and after the movie.

The plot is fairly straight forward, lawman (Ben Kane) seeks revenge against man (Frank Boone) who killed his son (son is played by Christopher Mitchum).  Being appointed marshal of Lordsburg puts the killer within the lawman's reach.  Plot though differing from Will Henry's book will hold the viewer's attention, although we have seen similar plots in other movies, yet with the cast of this movie everything seems to work. I received more enjoyment in watching this western than I expected.

The cast as mentioned beyond Mitchum, Dickinson, and Walker, Jr. includes: David Carradine, Jack Kelly, John Anderson, Rodopho Acosta, Parley Baer, and Paul Fix, among others.  It was also exceedingly good to see 'Maverick' Jack Kelly once again in a movie and he played the black hat to its fullest.

The location of filming will be apparent to most western buffs, Old Tucson, Kinney Road, Arizona. Down through the years how many westerns one wonders have been filmed in that location, probably equalled or exceeded only by Lone Pine, California.

Most reviews will allow only a couple stars for this movie, yet with everything working as smoothly as it does, plus the boatload of veteran actors, I give it 4 stars. Having several dozen books by Will Henry/Clay Fisher on the shelf, I enjoyed it very much, a movie to watch again. Almost as good as YELLOWSTONE KELLY, but not quite.

3796799,4,B001U6YIBA,"If you are a fan of old-school westerns...how can you truly go too far wrong  with Burt Kennedy writing and directing and star power like Robert Mitchum (in any year) and Angie Dickinson (still smouldering in 1969)...not to mention Robert Walker  Jr  and David Carradine as the youth demographic.
This isn't  a top tier Western or second tier...but middle of the  road. However, I'm thrilled to have a decent  looking  widescreen print of it for around  ten bucks as I love  Robert Mitchum and hang on  his every word. If you are a fan of his or Angies...pick  it  up.

3796801,5,B001U6YIBA,"Robert Mitchum in one his very best roles. Angie Dickinson in one of her very best roles, Robert Walker in one of his very best roles and that goes for David Carradine, too. A raucous and even fun at times look at the old west with a crook (walker) teaming up with and salty old Sheriff to get a job done. I am not going to tell you the job but this is a very well paced and well storied and well dialoged western and you will be entertained al whole bunch.",1445299200,2,457,3.9782608695652173
3796802,4,B001U6YIBA,"Released in 1969, ""Young Billy Young"" tells the story of Lordsburg, Arizona, where a new lawman comes to town (Robert Mitchum). He takes to a foolish young gun (Robert Walker Jr.) because he reminds him of his murdered son and also to a saloon girl (Angie Dickenson) who's happens to be the woman of the bad man who runs the town (Jack Kelly). John Anderson plays the criminal whom the lawman came to bring to justice. Deana Martin (Dean's daughter) is on hand as the kid's possible romantic interest while David Carradine plays a ne'er-do-well.

The story is based on Will Henry's ""Who Rides with Wyatt,"" a fictionalized novel that focuses on Wyatt Earp's relationship with young Billy Clanton, but the names were changed for the movie. Wyatt becomes Marshal Kane (Mitchum), Billy Clanton becomes Billy Young (Walker Jr.) and the town villain is named after the corrupt sheriff of Tombstone, John Behan. The plot is similar to 1959's ""Rio Bravo"" and 1966' ""El Dorado"" while the tone is akin to the more contemporary ""El Dorado"" and 1968's ""Bandolero!"" Speaking of the latter, the quirky nature of the score by Shelly Manne is reminiscent of the score to ""Bandolero!,"" albeit not quite as good, yet still very notable (of course, some hate it). Robert Mitchum sings the title song.

If you favor any of those three films you'll likely appreciate ""Young Billy Young,"" although it's the least of 'em. While the cast is great, with Mitchum towering as the fearless and confident protagonist, and there are numerous impressive Western visuals  e.g. the awe-inspiring locomotive/train, the magnificent stagecoach and the ensuing stagecoach hold-up attempt  there are too many glaring unlikelihoods. For instance, why don't the bandits chasing the stagecoach simply shoot one of the eight horses linked to it? That'd bring it down real quick. Nevertheless, there's enough good here for an enjoyable Western experience, even though you might say ""Yeah, right"" now and then. The chemistry between Mitchum and Dickinson is palpable and there's a moving line the latter says to the former that steals the show.

The film is short-n-sweet at 89 minutes and was shot in Old Tucson, Arizona.

GRADE: B- (a weak 4/5 Stars or strong 3/5 Stars)",1444435200,,2228,4.991913746630728
3796803,3,B001U6YIBA,"Watching YOUNG BILLY YOUNG, I couldn't help but think the script was originally intended for a television movie.  Certainly the film is short enough to fill a ninety- minute slot with commercials  (if you remove five or ten minutes of traveling shots that do nothing but slow the pace).  But, back in 1969, if you had Robert Mitchum starring in your picture, you had a theatrical movie even if it was destined to debut on a double bill.

Maybe Im showing my age here.  Does anybody else remember double bills?

Burt Kennedy wrote and directed the screenplay, which was adapted from a novel by Heck Allen that dealt with Wyatt Earp.  For whatever reason, Kennedy decided that he didn't want his film to be about the legendary lawman, so he changed the names of most of the key characters.

Mitchum plays a lawman who becomes the deputy marshal in the town of Lordsburg.  His primary assignment is to collect overdue taxes, but hes really there to get revenge against a local outlaw (John Anderson) who, years ago killed his son while escaping from jail.  Along the way, he takes the title character (Robert Walker, Jr.), a would-be outlaw, under his wing and also becomes involved with dance hall hostess Angie Dickinson.  Shes trying to break away from nasty Jack Kelly, who runs the town.

I know nothing about the making of YOUNG BILLY YOUNG, but from viewing the finished picture, I am assuming that the largest chuck of the budget went to pay Mitchums salary.  And, he was certainly worth it because his presence is the best thing about the movie, which suffers from poor production values, lax direction and an underdeveloped screenplay.  On the other hand, Angie Dickinson and the Arizona scenery are nice to look at.

David Carradine is also in the cast of this United Artists film, available on DVD from Kino Lorber.
