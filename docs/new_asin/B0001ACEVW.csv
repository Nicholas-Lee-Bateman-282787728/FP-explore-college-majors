8176540,5,B0001ACEVW,"Incredibly moving success stories for autistic children. I cried for joy.

This film suggests to me that all children need to have worthwhile projects and tangible results, even at an early age. They all need a sense of worth, and not just words of encouragement and grades. This is especially true for kids struggling with learning disabilites.",1485734400,,345,5.052631578947368
8176541,4,B0001ACEVW,"This is a charming movie starring Pete Duel and Kim Darby.  They play a young couple who plan to deliver their baby at home.  Kims' father, in the movie, is played by David Janssen (of The Fugitive).  He is uptight about the whole thing and thinks his daughter is off her rocker.  He brings in his own obstetrician (Carl Reiner) and calamity ensues.  A charming reminder of a time now gone!!",1378857600,,391,4.450704225352113
8176542,4,B0001ACEVW,"Dated commedy that relives the generation conflicts of the late 60's. The main commedy is the ongoing idealism of the ""back to nature"" younger generation coming into conflict with the older experiences of the adult world. Finally the reality of the situation sets in when medical complications arise that are not covered in the handbooks of ""do it yourself child birth"". Then the panic sets in and chaos ensues similar to ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". The only negative aspect is the fact the studio refuses to release it on DVD. So if you are lucky enough to get a copy at a flea market (I paid .50 cents), and a working VHS player, you can enjoy it too.",1327449600,,660,4.462809917355372
8176543,4,B0001ACEVW,In contrast to something like RICHARD DIAMOND  (made so much earlier) this seems dated but it's quite fun. Good to see David Janssen doing comedy. Found his drunken scene amusing. This is excellent  if a fan of David Janssen or Pete Duel. Carl Reiner is good in this.,1192233600,,267,4.541666666666667
