4154181,5,B003LZS76K,I love this a  movie even though it may be low budget it was good.,1411603200,,66,3.4
4154182,2,B003LZS76K,It was definitely made for home viewing.  Persons will probably fall asleep watching or donate it to Goodwill.  It was not worth the price listed.  Look for this at your local yard sale.,1403222400,,186,4.575757575757576
4154183,4,B003LZS76K,"Yes it was a low budget movie, yes the acting was bad but I felt as if it was a real depiction of life in the hood for drug dealers. I also enjoyed seeing a woman who was in charge albeit she was in charge of dealing poison to her community. Many black movies dealing with crime and the inner city does not portray a woman as the main character or villain so I liked that twist. Overall, if you can sit through the bad acting and thick accents I would recommend this movie.",1375228800,3,473,4.042553191489362
4154184,5,B003LZS76K,I chose this rating cause the package came in the time frame that was given to me.  The package was brand new and for a good price.  I would shop with this company again.,1364428800,,170,3.9705882352941178
4154185,1,B003LZS76K,"This movie is a mess on all levels, it's all over the place, my most memorable was when Miller's daughter got the phone call from Queen she jumped up off the couch pulled a gun out from her back then ran out the house, now that was stupid at it's best and funny, all the men in the movie go dreadlocks smh plus everyone talk as if the movie was made in some part of the south or neworleans,this movie is not worth money, they should just give it away!",1353715200,,451,4.022222222222222
4154186,1,B003LZS76K,"When I first saw the trailer front this I thought it was a high school drama group using personal cameras to tape themselves. Then after watching iMovie I realized a high school drama group would put on a better show than this crap. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the dialogue is awful. The boost annoying thing is the fact that NOT ONE person can say their lives with any realism, it's like they brought people off the streets and said here's a script....now Action.....two thumbs down, should of spent money on getting actors not big ass cars.",1347321600,,554,4.4950495049504955
4154187,1,B003LZS76K,"The film opens with some horrible first person narration to build a story. Queen Pin (Rhanni) becomes the mistress of a drug dealer. When he gets busted, she goes to jail for being a bad actress, a crime in Jacksonville. Once out she wants to build her ""own organization"" so she can start her own record label, although I couldn't figure out why she needed her own record label. She spends her disposable income on clinging clothes that make her look chunky.

As a new drug dealer in town, she steps on the toes of the existing one. The writing was cliche and the dialogue was terrible. The actors couldn't deliver their lines with any kind of realism. One of the guys had the nickname ""Killer."" The only thing Gin X accomplished was to make 50 Cent look like a genius, and I didn't think that was possible.

F-bombs, n-words, sex, no nudity.",1338076800,,842,4.496732026143791
4154188,4,B003LZS76K,"Watching this film, your not quite sure if you want Rhanni, the ""Queen Pin"" to rise to the top. After getting fed up with her ife struggles, this girl from the iner city wants to gain ground in the drug world. There is lots of guns, big bodied cars, and beautiful girls to keep your interest during the film. A must see!
