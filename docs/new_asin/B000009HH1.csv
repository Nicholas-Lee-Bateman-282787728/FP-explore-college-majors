7905498,4,B000009HH1,"Edward Yang is one of the few filmmakers who can make the present-day seem like a dystopia.  He is often compared to Antonioni: this is his 'Blowup' - an ascetically formal, fragmented murder mystery stumbled on by a photographer.  In his use of dream narrative and a character who writes a mystery novel, Yang goes beyond the Italian in narrative obscurity.
'The Terroriser' shares many themes with Yang's more accessible masterpieces 'A Brighter Summer Day' and 'Yi-Yi (a one and a two)' - the alienating effects of capitalist, urban life; the alienation of relationships and aimlessness of youth; the mind-numbing compromises and betrayals in the workplace - but in a framework that coldly precludes identification.",992995200,,718,5.234782608695652
