2408725,5,B000B8KH4U,I certainly did enjoy seeing this movie again as Gary Cooper and the beautiful Susan Hayward worked well together. Not to mention Richard Widmark. All three of my favorite actors and this movie is a great western. A classic for sure.,1261872000,,233,4.7073170731707314
2408726,3,B000B8KH4U,"The plot is very simple and there is not much action. It is all about Leah Fuller (Susan Hayward)'s struggle with gold, love and life.

It is another western, watchable.",1249948800,,169,4.633333333333334
2408727,5,B000B8KH4U,"Garden of Evil is a western rich with characterization that seems stereotypical on the surface, but on analysis, runs much deeper. Susan Hayward (an enigmatic heroine) hires a group of stranded travelers in a Mexican waterfront town to follow her to a remote mine where her husband is trapped. The adventurous group is comprised of Gary Cooper (the upright, moralistic hero), Richard Widmark (a cynical witticism spouting gambler), Victor Manuel Mendoza (the good-natured Mexican guide) and Cameron Mitchell (the back-shooting kid gunslinger). They must traverse perilous and dangerous Indian territory to get to the mine, but their motives are unclear. Is it the trapped man, the lure of gold or the subdued sexual attraction that Hayward exudes that drives them? The narrative is a study of personalities in conflict, their motivations, loyalties, cowardice and heroism. Richard Widmark's character comes off as the most interesting. He lingers in the viewer's mind long after the film is over and the question is raised - which is the more honorable: the moralistic hero or the dubiously elegant yet noble rogue? Henry Hathaway is a director known for atmosphere, character and authentic locations. He combines mood and action. This film has all those elements. It is beautifully photographed, yet the picturesque landscapes are juxtaposed with disturbingly photographed death scenes, menacing ever-lurking Indians (always photographed from a distance) and even mysterious looking set designs. The church bell tower sprouting up from the dried lava is all that remains of the town outside the mine and is symbolically ominous in appearance. Frank Fenton's screenplay is filled with vague dialog and only adds to the total feeling of uneasiness that permeates this film. Bernard Herrmann's score accentuates the moodiness of this haunting adventure tale, itself also vague and non-specific. It is very untypical of the Hollywood western. This is by no means a minor score by Herrmann. He achieved a recurrent sense of ominous fate throughout this entire film without the score ever entering into the psychological realm. I rank this as one of his great scores.",1192233600,6,2162,5.3617647058823525
2408728,4,B000B8KH4U,"Well written, well acted ---- good good guys, bad good guys, a love interest, great scenery, enough action to keep your attention..",1517184000,,131,5.0
2408729,3,B000B8KH4U,The movie itself probably merit a bit more (at least an extra 1/2 star).  Coopers performance is solid (albeit a tad more wooden that Id would have liked) and his advanced age renders some of his performance (notably the fist fights) a tad too unrealistic.  Widmark is great. My reason for the lower rating is that this streaming version is not properly formatted (and you cant correct it using your TVs different format)...  It makes for a distorted picture during the entire flick.,1516406400,3,483,4.795180722891566
2408730,5,B000B8KH4U,You cannot go wrong with a Gary Cooper movie and this one is excellent.  They just don't make movies like this anymore where they actually depend on the writing and the actors instead of profanity and nudity that has no bearing on the movie.,1514332800,2,241,4.4772727272727275

2408733,5,B000B8KH4U,"In my case, since Gary Cooper heads the cast, it's an automatic five star pick.  His stalwart ex-Marshal mixes extremely well with Susan Hayward's lady-in-distress and Richard Widmark's tin horn gambler.  Fun movie!",1446249600,,215,5.484848484848484

2408744,4,B000B8KH4U,"CINEMA CLASSICS COLLECTION has provided a superb Scope transfer - 2.35 ratio - excellent colour clear picture and sound. Extras...An Audio Commentary, a doc ""Making of.."" with among others Cooper's daughter, trailer etc. On a personal note I have to confess this isn't a favourite of mine. It is beautifully filmed on magnificent locations (with some excellent Matte work in places), and I can't criticise the acting - All 4 principals deliver the performences you expect and enjoy. Hugh (what a voice he had) Marlowe is a bit wasted, and Rita Moreno fans...well don't get too excited! The direction from Hathaway seems very slow and there is little action until t5owards the end. However, as I often ask myself if I am in doubt...Did I enjoy it, and, Yes I did. With reservations as above I recomend this to the stars fans. 5 stars for the DVD quality, 3 for the film itself, hence 4 stars. Well worth a go, particularly if you like the film already.",1411689600,,951,4.700598802395209

2408746,4,B000B8KH4U,"Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward and Richard Widmark all under one camera and in glorious technicolor.  What a fun movie this is.  Hayward is a devoted wife needing help for her injured hubby who has discovered a producing gold mine. The problem is that the mine is far into the interior of Mexico and will take five days to get there. There are hundreds of vicious Indians waiting to pounce every step of the way. However, they don't do anything until later.  Widmark is a gambler, while Cooper is a former soldier who has ended up in Tampico awaiting a boat home.  Cameron Mitchell is also along as a greedy, horny young fool. They don't know each other before Hayward strides into the cantina and offers big bucks to them to help her with her hubby. Cooper becomes the leader of the pack and the adventure begins.",1403654400,,810,4.527397260273973
2408747,5,B000B8KH4U,"This is more along the lines of a western/drama.  Lots of beautiful scenery and of course, Gary Cooper.  This film has a great storyline and excellent acting.  Of course being in vivid color helps a lot!",1402531200,,203,4.583333333333333

2408751,5,B000B8KH4U,An old movie that's still good today.  The story is good unlike so many new movies.  The acting is good and I enjoyed watching it again after a lot of years gone by.,1364515200,2,165,3.9696969696969697
2408752,4,B000B8KH4U,"Beautifully filmed in a unusal Mexican location. Director Henry Hathaway esembled a all star cast to follow a determed woman through Apache country to help her diabled husband.

2408753,5,B000B8KH4U,"Four cynics, who are strangers to each other, heed the call of a siren to rescue her husband in Mexico. This reviews the newly available French Blu-ray and it is becoming apparent that Europeans have more respect for craftsmanship than American film ""executives"". There was some concern on the part of an often consulted and useful web site that this disc would keep the sub titles on the screen regardless of which buttons were pushed. I am pleased to report that my Oppo doesn't do this. When you consider that this is in the original CinemaScope ratio, the sharpness and color consistency is astonishing with the same blue sky in every background. The makers of THE SEARCHERS knew they had something special on their hands when they shot it in VistaVision. The same can be said of Bernard Hermann's score for this splendidly scenic, well acted, and weirdly brilliant Western. The 1950's knew all about different layers of meaning and symbolism, from INVADERS FROM MARS to TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE. This picture is hardly any less profound.",1354838400,,1045,4.943181818181818
2408754,5,B000B8KH4U,"A great,hypnotic western. I don't really understand why this flick is so good,maybe it's the super wide angle cinematography,Hermann's Hitchcockian music,Hathaway's economic direction which comes off more profound than mainline or characters thrown together to play out a non-plot,as you sense they are all are hiding themselves from each other. Wow,and there's the strangeness of it all,indians seen,and feared from afar,Susan Hayward,whatever happened to likes of her,who comes off as cold,a deceiver,probably bad to the bone, but,she throws out those heavy sexual vibes that's enough to make you want crawl through the TV screen and pat Cameron Mitchell on the back for trying to rape her. Watch Susan really ride her horse like Ben Johnson in drag. It's really pretty amazing stuff. Of course Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark are along for the ride also,and,like Susan, they really ride their horses,which makes for realism we are not used to these days,because old school hollywood was not computer graphic-ed to death and actors who were bold enough to get a major role in a major western had better be able to do some major horseback riding because insurance companies and lawyers were not a force to be reckoned with in the 1950's world of cinema production,which makes for a long gone realism,that has to be seen to be appreciated. Maybe it just all came together,for a few months in mexico,when Hathaway and company shot GOE,there's lots to watch,every frame is full to the brim of wide angle images and looks just right. Cooper,Widmark and Mitchell along with a doomed Mexican sidekick,throw in with Susan. They ride into indian country to rescue Susan's husband,who's gold mine fell on him,so he's trapped and hurt and that's basically the plot,but Hayward,Cooper etc. make this film so much more because of the complexities they interject into their characters. Widmark and cooper take on the distant indians in a closing shoot-out masterly filmed and edited by Hathaway. The final frames project one of the best Western endings ever,very cinematic,we are left dangling,no questions are answered,no ends come together,Hathaway's story has no convenient ending,he does give us a brilliant sunset with Cooper and Hayward therein,but where they went to from there?...we'll never know. Lesson to be learned,or the great truth of Garden of Evil.....if your gonna rape Susan Hayward,you'd better tie her up and gag her first because 1)she has no humor when it comes to rape2)she'll whip your a__ all over that cinemascoped creek bank,just like she did Cameron Mitchell.......thanks Susan,Gary etc.you were the best....",1340755200,4,2624,5.26491646778043
2408755,5,B000B8KH4U,"This solemn adventure features the great Gary Cooper and a top cast in a western that never received its proper due. The plot is about a rescue mission into desolate mountain country to save a woman's husband trapped in a mine. However, it's the trek back to Puerto Miguel that puts the party in grave danger from hostile Indians. The film details the motives of the rescue party of diverse types and touches on the darker sides of human failings such as greed, untrustworthiness and cowardice. Cooper is at his laconic best with one or two syllable answers to his partners' questions about his background. He is self-contained, alert, understanding and heroic and the group's acknowledged leader. Susan Hayward, in one of her few western roles, matches Cooper with an intense yet vulnerable portrayal of a woman with personal demons regarding her husband. Richard Widmark, a gambler and Cameron Mitchell, a bounty hunter, are also in top form and round out the film's main characters. Widmark is predictably icy and surly, a lean thesping of a character seemingly written just for him. Mitchell has a thankless role of a boastful rowdy with a hair-trigger temper. The movie's highlight is the group's flight from the Indians through the mountains in their attempt to reach safety. The CinemaScope lensing is wonderful, as is Bernard Hermann's brooding music score.",1338508800,,1365,5.04424778761062
2408756,4,B000B8KH4U,"I never was much of a fan of Westerns, but I'd say this film was one that caught and held my attention. The reason I bought it in the first place was I had purchased a CD of the soundtrack a couple of weeks before (I am a Bernard Herrmann) fan and I wanted to experience the film with the music in context and I never once regretted making this purchase.

I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys and appreciates A) old Westerns, B) a great film score, C) Gary Cooper, Richard Widmark, Susan Hayward or any of the other actors back in the day who were in this film. The film was well-acted and it didn't bog down in the story line. I'm also glad this film was made in color. The panoramic scenes in the film just wouldn't have the same effect if they were in B&W.",1325980800,,771,4.105960264900662

8083486,3,B000B8KH4U,"For me, it's one of the most visually stunning films ever made... Filmed in Mexico, the terrain and locations are highly dramatic... a perfect place to be filming horses and riders from great angles. Unfortunately, the story and dialogue doesn't come near to filling up that starkly beautiful container. About half of the lines might have looked good on paper, but just sound dumb coming out of the actors' mouths in the situations they're in. Cooper, Hayward, and Widmark try to make the odd plot jell but it just doesn't. It also has 1954 vintage cartoon Hollywood Apaches with no lines... in fact we never see them closer than 50 yards away. It closes with one of the most iconic lines in filmdom... Gary Cooper against a fabulous Technicolor sunset drawling ""I guess if the earth were made of gold, men would die for a handful of dirt."" That's by far the best moment!",1518220800,,871,4.662337662337662
8083487,4,B000B8KH4U,"Good enough that you keep watching to see how it turns out.  Plot wise it didn't have to be a western; in fact it might have worked better as a contemporary moore set in a remote land - like Treasure of Sierra Madre.  The biggest problem is that Haywards attractions are not intense enough suspend disbelief in the male reaction.  The viewer has to make a conscious effort to accept the characters motivations rather than just letting them emerge viscerally.  Still the plot idea is interesting enough to engage one even if not as intensly as you might like.

The aspect ration of Amazons streaming version in incorrect - it makes all the characters look like they have been on an extreme fasting diet.",1517875200,,702,4.629032258064516
