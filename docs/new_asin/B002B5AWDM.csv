3892790,5,B002B5AWDM,This is a very well made movie.  It has an honesty to it that it like a breath fresh air.  Let it flow through your bones.  Give it time and be amazed.,1337126400,,151,3.65625
3892791,5,B002B5AWDM,"the acting was phenominal, the story was unforgetable and of course the directing was wonderful.
This movie blew my mind.  Ive been a lover of lori pettys movies since i was a child (32 now) and never knew a thing about her life. I just knew that her amazing spirit shows in everything she does and frankly she makes me laugh and happy. What i didn't know was the story of her childhood that this movie depicts.
names have been changed but its the story of her and her sisters living in a w**re house known as the poker house with their mother who didn't care about them and her pimp/boyfriend. The mother has all intention of having her daughter pimped out as well as she sees she is coming of age. The mothers a mess, a cruel drunk and drug addict without a maternal bone in her body. agnes (lori) has taken on the parental role for her 2 sisters doing the best she can under the circumstances all 3 children trying to fnd solace in places and projects outside the house. Agnes as a budding basketball player, the best on her team.
the redemption in the movie being of course knowing that she would eventually beat all odds and become the huge star and now director that we know of today.
Jennifer Lawrence, well, I have never seen her in much before but I now want to see everything shes ever done.
great movie.",1332201600,4,1314,4.341463414634147
3892792,3,B002B5AWDM,"It was only satisfying, only because actress Chloe Grace Mertz
pretty much caries the movie. Selma Blair, gave an worthy performance, but not enough to have notice in the film. The filmed gives us a slow start, and look at the reality of a young girl, and her sister,d fighting to survive an abusive home. Thier mother, who's spiraling downward continuously, from the
,the heavy use of drugs. But a great thing happens that I enjoyed, Agnes, the older sister steps up and assumes responsibility for her two younger sisters. As the film tuggs along, Agnes realizes her mother
is so strung out on drugs, she looses the mind set to care for her two daughters. But Agnes picks up the
prices by getting things back in order to care for herself and two you.nger sisters.",1309910400,,764,4.625
3892793,5,B002B5AWDM,"Good story, Chloe Moretz was very good in this, as she is in all her movies. Had good story about oldest sister and her life",1308268800,,124,4.0
3892794,3,B002B5AWDM,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this movie.  We see a day in the life of a girl living in horrible conditions, one who is a talented basketball player, but we see nothing of what she did to better herself or how she did it.  All of Charles Dickens's or Horatio Alger's characters grew up in situations just as bad as Agnes.  But, their stories are really about how the boys or girls managed to better their situation to become successful as adults.  There is none of that in this movie other than a little statement at the end that says Agnes grew up to write and direct the movie.  I felt that this was the first of a trilogy of movies, with the second - her struggle to overcome her situation and to be accepted as an honorable person - and the third - what she has done to become successful as an adult - missing.

I might add that we have had over 150 kids stay with us over the years, and quite a few were from situations quite similar to that of Agnes, including children of prostitutes.  Both my father and grandfather were 'slumlords' in Detroit and Atlanta, and we got to know many children from horrible situations.  But, they knew that we loved each one and that we treated them with dignity.  The kids would run to my grandfather and he'd hug them like he did his own grandchildren.  I remember one seven-year-old girl who one time jumped into my arms with a ragged dress and panties so dirty they left my clothes smelling.  But, how could I help but give such an eager little soul a hug and tell her she was very special?  Most of the kids were satisfied to stay in the slums, but every once in a while one would stand out - we called them 'superkids' - and seek us out for mentoring.  Many are now successful adults.

I've never heard of one of those 'at risk' children who became a successful adult who did not have at least one adult in his or her life who challenged and encouraged them.  We see none of this in this movie.  Is the writer saying that she became successful without any outside encouragement?  Without seeing some evidence of how she overcame her circumstances, just following a typical day in the life of a girl growing up in horrible circumstances is ultimately unsatisfying.",1272412800,7,2208,4.372549019607843

3892797,5,B002B5AWDM,This is the kind of movie that you are still thinking about when you wake up the next day. It is funny and sad at the same time.

3892802,4,B002B5AWDM,"Relationships and living arrangements are so chaotic in this autobiopic about Lori Petty's early teenage years, sometimes it's hard to figure out who is who or what they're up to. Still, things are clear enough to grasp the abysmal extent of prevailing dysfunction, particularly between Lori Petty and her hooker mom. It is Lori's basketball skills and high intelligence that stand as guards to her later development. (The movie ends before Lori's trip to New York and the beginnings of an acting career that has raised her net worth to the low millions.) Great acting by Jennifer Laurence and Selma Blair and good support from the remaining cast makes The Poker House a 4+ star movie.",1478476800,5,685,4.913793103448276

Lori Petty, who wrote and directed the movie and who claims that it is a true story based on her own life, yet has a biography in IMDB that does not fit the story... not convincing!

Anything less does little to communicate the physical,psychic and universal  pain and death of trust. This is a movie that really left me spellbound with Jennifer Lawrence's  raw, natural talent and Lori Petty's strength in writing and directing her life on film with the unvarnished truth. I have great respect for her talent and bravery. I couldn't decide if the last scene was appropriate or not, but moving on...having the strength to do so, saving your sisters, is always worth the courage represented by a song.",1470614400,,612,5.171717171717172

Petty doesn't sugar coat her life as a young woman in rural Missouri and Jennifer Lawrence plays the role of the 14 year-old Petty taking care of her siblings and her prostitute mother. They live in a gambling (Poker) house since  her Meth-cooking father went missing. In order to keep her siblings from being split up she has to either find her dad alive or prove that he's dead.

I love drama/truth based movies. That have a lot of issues within the family and it can sometimes go places you think they would never go. It really is a story of pain,family,and bravery for Jennifer Lawerence's character in this movie. She goes through a lot and really becomes stronger by the end of the movie.

Chloe's character is so sweet and innocent and just a joy to watch her act as I always do. It's a great sisterly movie with drama and chaos.",1436832000,,686,4.229007633587786

3892858,3,B002B5AWDM,"Set in one day in 1976, Council Bluffs, Iowa, The Poker House follows the story of a 14-year-old girl Agnes (Jennifer Lawrence) trying to survive the harrowing difficulties of life when she and her two sisters Bee (Sophi Bairley) and Cammie (Chlo Grace Moretz) are neglected by their mother Sarah (Selma Blair), addicted to alcohol and drug. Bokeem Woodbine appears as Sarahs abusive boyfriend Duval.

There are several emotionally strong moments in The Poke House thanks to the star Jennifer Lawrence (her first lead role), who appeared in this film two years before Winter's Bone.

The film has an authentic atmosphere, but suffers from its slow pace and lack of back story. The relationship between Agnes and Duval plays a crucial role in the film, but as we know so little of their personal backgrounds that a series of events in the final act seem a bit too sudden.

Lori Petty (A League of Their Own) directs this based-on-the-truth film. Petty also co-writes the film with David Alan Grier, who briefly appears. The Poker House is a very personal film and some parts are effectively done, but the impact could have been much stronger with a better pace and more focus on character development.",1428364800,,1200,4.872549019607843

3892871,3,B002B5AWDM,"Considering the subject matter, this movie lacks any real punch. The scenes seem sketchy with the characters showing up to deliever their lines (with unconvincing emotion). More of a problem with the script than the acting.

Compare this movie with ""An American Crime"" (Ellen Page). The ""Poker House"" is interesting solely because it has Jennifer Lawrence and Chloe Moretz before they were big, well known names. ""An American Crime"" is so real and depressing, it will make you feel depressed and gloomy for days (so much that you should be warned before watching it).

Poker House is not one of the better dramas I've seen, but I still recommend it for Jennifer Lawrence and Chloe Moretz fans. Chole Moretz continues to amaze me with her acting skills at such a young age, but doesn't have a lot of screen time in this movie.",1414108800,,825,4.7622377622377625
3892872,3,B002B5AWDM,"Based on a true story that takes place in Iowa. Agnes (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 14 year old girl advanced for her age. She plays basketball, does calculus, holds down a local job, keeps the household together and gives dry boring narration about her life and dogs biting. Her mother (Selma Blair) owns the Poker House"" which is known for poker, gambling, drinking, prostitution, and apparently drugs, although the nightly antics are basically limited to one night, so the audience never got the real feeling of despair.

Bee (Sophi Bairley) is 12 years old and delivers papers. She stays at the neighbors whenever possible. Cammie (Chlo Grace Moretz) is the youngest and in spite of all the praise for J-Law, I couldn't wait for her character to come on screen as she rattled off at the mouth.

The story is slow. It spends time to fully develop the sisters' characters. Agnes, is coming of age and has a touch of Jungle Fever, which becomes both her demise and finally salvation. It is an interesting tale, but it felt incomplete. Personally I thought Lawrence's acting in ""Winterbone"" smoked this one.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape, nudity (Selma Blair) 3 1/2 stars

The film leads you to believe this was the bio for Lori Petty but her IMDB bio reads: ""She spent her childhood traveling the US with her father, a Pentecostal minister. Her keen talents first lent themselves toward being a graphic artist in Omaha, Nebraska, but an impulsive desire to act quickly took precedence and soon she was off to New York""

""She was the first female editor of the North High School newspaper and graduated in 1982.
Attended North High School, Sioux City, Iowa, where she was involved in Yearbook and speech/debate.""

The film suggests she left for NYC at 14. Seems to be some missing story.",1413676800,5,1782,4.7882736156351795

And she rolls with the story. Again I say I have not been so taken by an actress or actor in my life. I lived with a young girl who just met all occasions with guts.
In my old age I have developed a habit of reading books and watching movies  several times, each time catching more of the story. To me this is a great story about adversity and how some rise up to meet the challenges.

3892895,3,B002B5AWDM,"I purchased this along with WINTERS BONE because of Jennifer Lawrence.  This young lady is destined to become the biggest star in the Hollywood heavens in years to come IF she doesn't do very many pictures like POKER HOIUSE.  This story of a fourteen-year-old white girl with a prostitute mother who has a black pimp is supposedly based on a true story but you have a hard time caring one iota about someone who is as clueless about life as this character is.  The real life subject was instrumental in getting the movie produced but when it is over, if you make it to the end, you come away wondering how anyone with an IQ over 50 (and the character is supposed to be smart) could put their self in the position they wind up in.

It is often stated that girls who find themselves in compromising situations ALWAYS ASK FOR IT.  It has become a well worn clich in courtrooms over the years.. Well there is no such thing as ALWAYS in life just as there are no absolutes in the universe.  However clichs become clichs because often it is the way it is. In this character's surroundings and with her supposed smarts the viewer comes away with the perception of ""SHE ASKED FOR IT"".

If you are looking for Jennifer Lawrence's first big steamy sex scene, well look someplace else this is not it.  And if you want to see a sample of this fine actress in her early work, then get WINTERS BONE.",1390262400,,1385,4.3828125

3892908,3,B002B5AWDM,"I bought ""The Poker House"" because it featured two of my favorite young actors, Jennifer Lawrence and Chloe Grace Moretz, in a 2008 film before they were famous.

  Lawrence, who was 17 when this film was shot, plays barely 14-year old Agnes, the daughter of an emotionally-twisted, drug/ alcohol-addicted, prostitute-mother portrayed by the wonderful Selma Blair.

  Moretz, who must have realistically been around 11 years old, is one of Agnes' sisters, Cammie.  Sadly underutilized, Moretz has little to do in the story other than sit at a bar and trade non sequiturs with an alcohol-addled, delusional and paranoid barfly (David Alan Grier).

  Agnes, as the de facto manager of this house of ill repute, is infatuated with a black pimp (Bokeem Woodbine) who treats her nice with gentle kisses while beating and selling her strung-out mother.  Finally, the pimp decides it's time for Agnes to join Mommy and he viciously attacks the 14-year old.  The violation is painful and hard to watch,  Especially difficult to observe is the reaction, or should I say nonreaction to this violation by her mother who later makes it clear she would die for her pimp.

  The Lawrence character has a big basketball game on this night of the molestation,  What is her pre-game ritual?  Stretching and Gatorade?  Hardly, she drinks alcohol, and smokes weed & cigarettes.  Then there's that little incident concerning the (dare we say it?) rape.

  The casual viewer might think Agnes wouldn't have the right mindset for this contest.  Casting her fate to the wind, she shows up for the game, although it is well into the second half.  Donning her metaphor-like Wonder Woman suit, she pours in 27 points in 7 minutes to steal the victory.  Agnes is laying on the floor after making the final shot.  The fans and her teammates convulse into hysterical celebration!  Meanwhile, does anyone care to pick up Agnes and offer her thanks for winning the game with her super-human effort.  Short answer:  No.  She walks out of the gym with nary a word said to her.  Not realistic.

  The basketball scenes were beyong not believeable.  They were AWFUL.  Plus, a body double was used for Lawrence during the more-athletic moves, a fact confirmed by director Lori Petty in a special features interview.

  I didn't like the movie.  Director Petty said she based this story on her real life experiences while growing up in Iowa.  Petty probably told a mostly-honest and accurate story with a little embellishment thrown in to spice up the plot.  I found the storyline sad and detestable, many of the characters despicable with the overall effect creating an emotion of depression.  I realize that is not a credible critique of Petty's moving-making skill.  It just left me feeling rather ill.

  Blair and Lawrence were brilliant.  Lawrencce, already showing signs of greatness two years before her Academy Award-nominated role in ""Winter's Bone"" won the Outstanding Performance Award at the Los Angeles Film Festival for this portrayal of a bright but abused 14-year old,  Lawrence is, indeed, a wonder.",1366934400,14,3080,4.990118577075099

And I actually HATED Selma Blair for being entirely oblivious and self absorbed. Lori Petty is an amazing director and story teller.  I think the rape scene halted any possibility of theatrical release.  I had to keep reminding myself that JLaw was actually 18 when it was filmed and that there were several other people in the room while filming.  She was just so vulnerable.  Ugh.
