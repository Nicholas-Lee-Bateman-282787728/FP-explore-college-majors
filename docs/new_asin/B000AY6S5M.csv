2396508,3,B000AY6S5M,"I think it's a great idea to make an animated version of this story we all love so much.  A good amount of the dialogue was exactly like the movie -- I liked that.  I also really enjoyed the fall colors in the animation.  The little girl who did Anne's voice did a great job.  My main critical comment about the animated version is that the evil characters (especially the lady who is the head of the orphanage) seem really out of place.  These characters and the far-fetched plot that unfolds would never have been in the original Anne movies, and I thought it really took away from it.  People who like the Anne of Green Gables movies like them because of the overall sweetness and innocence in them.  I think most people would have preferred that the animated version reflect this same feeling instead of this unbelievable, scary scenario that is not what people expect in an Anne of Green Gables story.  I would also say that it would be for older children due to the evil characters being a little over the edge for younger children.",1230595200,,1038,4.48404255319149
2396509,3,B000AY6S5M,"There are ways this cartoon is cute, because it is BASED on ""Anne of Green Gables.""  But... and this is a big but.... BUT.... so much is changed and added, if you're a real ""Anne of Green Gables"" enthusiast you will be very disappointed.  It's cute and fun for someone who has never experienced any other ""Anne of Green Gables,"" but for those of us who have this cartoon is a real let-down.",1181692800,,390,4.328767123287672
2396510,5,B000AY6S5M,"Anne: Journey to Green Gables is an animated version of the original with Megan Follows and it's also a prequel to the animated series. What you'll see is how Anne got to be in Green Gables. After Anne's imagination gets the better of her when she's working for Mrs. Hammond, she is sent to Grout Orphanage where the sinister Madame Poubelle resides. Desperate to leave, Anne makes up a story that she is an heiress to a big fortune. Knowing that Anne is going to get into trouble, Mavis, Poubelle's secretary, sends her off to Prince Edward Island to live with the Cuthberts. If you've watched the animated series, you will see Felix and Felicity but you won't see Dryad, the wood nymph. Instead you'll see Billy the squirrel whom Anne meets at the orphanage. He is like Anne's conscience who tells her what's right. Think Jimminy Cricket from Disney's Pinocchio. When Madame Poubelle finds Anne and puts her on her hot air balloon, Billy saves her and Madame Poubelle goes down with the balloon. Although this movie is mainly for children, adults will love it too. As Ken Sullivan said on and on in the behind the scenes section of the DVD, ""this is a video for kids to watch with their parents"".",1129507200,,1198,4.602803738317757

8080348,2,B000AY6S5M,"The Anne of Green Gables series is quite good.  Well-produced, and it follows many of the stories in the book.  However, this DVD of ""Journey to Green Gables"" does not live up to the series.  It looks like it was originally meant to be shorter, and they tossed in some extraneous storylines to spread it out.
Get the series DVDs, and bypass this one.",1389398400,,350,4.4375

8080351,3,B000AY6S5M,"I'm an ardent fan of Anne of Green Gables, the books and also the TV movies,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables/dp/B00005YNTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables</a>&nbsp;and the sequels starring Megan Follows as Anne. When I saw that there were animated features of this series, I looked them up hoping to share them with my seven-year-old. I think I'll start her off on the TV films after my underwhelming experience with the animated shows.

Apparently, this animated series was conceived by Kevin Sullivan for PBS. This particular title, Anne- Journey to Green Gables is a 2005 production and is 85 minutes long, a prequel to the animated series. The only thing I found likable about this production is that the cast voices contain some beloved and familiar names such as Patricia Hamilton (who played Rachel Lynde in the TV films), Lally Cadeau, and several others. It is nowhere near as engaging as the films and for those who value authenticity in adaptations, I'd suggest the first two TV films instead (wasn't particularly a fan of the third film which marked a great departure from the actual stories in the books).",1344816000,,1192,5.443243243243243

8080353,3,B000AY6S5M,"I haven't bought this dvd on this website, but I have bought it from another store and I have seen it.  I really did enjoy it, but I'm seen the animated series when it was on PBS and what I didn't like about this movie was they changed some stuff around.  First of all,  Anne's hairstyle is a little different then in the animated series.  Of course this may be a minor concern.  Second of all,  For those who have seen the 26 or so episodes of the animated series will know that the voices for Anne and Diana have changed and are not the same as they were in the episodes which was a let down for me and possibly for other people as well.  Third of all, and I am just going to come out and say this.  There was hardly any good action and whatever action there was stunk horribly.  I mean, come on,  sure, this is a cartoon for little kids, but seriously, do you have to make what action scenes there were in the movie stink so horrible?  I think the action was lame.  It could have been better, despite whether this is for kids or not.  Now don't get me wrong, but I thought that the girl who played Anne did well and the one for Diana, but I wasn't excited about how they changed there voices.  Fourth, of course this may just be me, but for those who have watched the cartoon version, those people know very well that although it may not have been intended, there were signals and hints all over the episodes about Anne and Felix having feelings for each other.  I know what you all are going to say and you're probably going to say to me something like,  ""In the original,  Anne marries Gilbert.  Now come on people, I've never seen the original and I know that.  However, the animated series is somewhat different and Anne likes Felix in the animated series, and maybe I would get obsessiveness about this topic, but I enjoy it.  I really did enjoy the movie though and I have it in case I wish to watch it again.",1252713600,,1918,4.188524590163935
