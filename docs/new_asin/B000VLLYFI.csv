2945100,1,B000VLLYFI,"This was a very very bad movie. The script was awful. The actors over acted. In many scenes they got overly emotional and cried, what was suppose to look like crying, became forced crying with no tears. Which was down right awful!!!

Billy gets a brief little kiss from his hunky cowboy pal, the Dad sees and then it is all on.  Bad drama here...carries on to even more implausible scenarios.  Billy gets thrown out of home.  Goes to the city, meets a cutey in his first minutes who feeds him, houses him, befriends him and wants nothing in return - yeah right.  Billy gets a job looking after a stroke victim who lives with his gay son.  And I am a bit shallow obvioulsy, the stroke victim makes me shudder and I couldn't watch him...felt repulsed.  So Billy is there to look after him he is an Angel:0)  And the bald drag queen is like a car wreck - horrible but you can't help looking with that twisted look of 'Oh my God how awful' look on your face. And how come the mother (selfish cow) isn't lambasted for child abandonment but welcomed back like the long lost saviour...child services would have had Billy and his brother in this country...where are they in cowboy country???  Soooo, the stroke victim has a son who likes BIlly and voila...the end.  No angst, no real passion play, no heart-pounding kissing scenes.  A bit disappointing in all really.  But the friend ends up with cowboy pal and Billy ends up with stoke victim's son...happy ending.  I LOVE happy endings...but this seems like champagne without the crisp bubbles, a bit flat.  A bit too easy for my liking - where is the angst???  Don't hate it, don't love it...it's just...hmmm.",1201478400,9,1581,4.452961672473868
2945103,1,B000VLLYFI,"What a mess--truly a complete train wreck of a movie. There is nothing in this film to redeem it. It's embarassing and I'm amazed it was made at all. The story is so full of holes it's Swiss cheese. The production values are truly lame. The characters as written are unbelievable and ridiculous. The acting is uniformly bad across all players that nobody is helping this along with their achingly bad performances. Daily soap opera performances are Oscar calibre in comparison. This is the most erratic and inexplicable movie I've seen in a long time. On top of not making sense, it's not even entertaining in a campy way that some bad movies can transcend to.

The plot kinda resembles Sum of Us but without the good acting. And without the good production values. And without anything closely resembling a good movie. The plot has some possibilities but the writer/director squanders them on hollow, empty, stereotyped characters. At least the filmmaker didn't pander to the audience with nudity.

2945106,4,B000VLLYFI,"When 18 year old Billy's bible-thumping alcoholic father sees him exchange an exploratory kiss with another boy, he throws him out of their farm home.  Billy hitchhikes to Los Angeles, where he quickly makes friends and gets a job as a live-in aide for Mark, a multiple stroke victim who living with James, his gay photographer son. Billy's natural cheerful nature, honesty and willingness to help  make a difference in both men's lives.

When Billy comes home from a night out at the gay clubs with a friend, and laments on how they picked on his simple nature and choice of jobs, he tells James that he fears he will never be loved.  James is quick to reinforce that both he and his father love Billy like a member of the family, but he knows that isn't what Billy necessarily means.  This moment brings to the surface the growing attraction between the two.  But, when an old boyfriend of James resurfaces, Billy fears he is being deceived.

This is a sweet, highly emotional story, which surprisingly comes from Greg Osborn, a writer/director who is better known for his rather grusome horror films.  The largely inexperienced cast click well together (especially Dustin Belt in the title role), and manage to handle some rather tough emotional scenes.  Although the film lasts a full two hours, it felt unbalanced to me, with the first half of the film fully fleshed out into minute detail, while the second hour often seemd rushed and short of any significant plot points. I realize the writers were striving to concentrate on the positive aspects of the gay community in showing strangers willing to help Billy, but I think it took a turn from optimistic and veered into the ridiculous, about the time they started dancing in the hair salon. I was expecting some kind of conflict resulting from the visit of Billy's mom, and the absence of same means that visit really added nothing to the film.  The ""tying up of loose ends"" at the end also seemed a bit unrealistic.

Overall, however, this is a rather original, enjoyable film, definitely worth seeing.  DVD extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes, bloopers, writer/director interview, and a (somewhat overdone) tour of his home, where most of the film was shot.  I give the film four stars out of five.",1195776000,12,2284,4.810741687979539
2945107,1,B000VLLYFI,"The acting, dialogue, directing, set production.....everything about this movie was just horrible.  So let's just focus on it's biggest flaw, the complete lack of believability of this movie's storyline.

1) Billy is spotted kissing his best friend and is kicked out of his house by his crazy cliche bible-thumpin' father. Where does Billy go?? To live with his divorced mother, to find his best friend and cry on his shoulder?? Nope. He decides to hitch a ride to L.A. with only $40 and a backpack (which magically contains at least four or five changes of clothes.)

2)We spend a good 15 minutes with a phone conversation between the ugliest and most cliche drag queen in the world and a guy who's had a few strokes. Maybe I shouldn't laugh at a stroke victim, but it's so obvious his lips are literally glued together to pull off the stroke-face affect. The stroke victim's son is about 40 years old, but apparently the actor playing him hasn't been told this.  He plays it like he's 16 with much batting of the eyelashes, over-emoting and naivete. Stroke dad wants son to find a good man. Creepy son decides to hire a ""house boy"" to take care of stroke dad.

3) Upon arriving in L.A. Billy goes to a small cafe (which appears to also double as the courtyard of stroke dad's home.) He orders only a soda. The bitchy queen waiter, Guy, says, ""Sure honey...coming right up."" LOL. Yeah, that's a pretty typical response in L.A. He brings the drink and then says ""let's go get burgers."" The cliche hag whips up the burgers and fries in 20 seconds flat.  They chat using horrible dialogue for about a minute, Guy eating only a few fries and Billy eating nothing.  Flamy Guy doesn't know a thing about Billy but asks him to move in with him.  Back at Guy's apartment which also appears to be just a room in stroke dad's house with a ""1A"" number stuck on it, Billy asks to take a shower.  It literally takes him 15 seconds.  They lie in bed shirtless (and it's probably only about 6 or 7 p.m.) and just go to sleep.  Guess the writer, director, producer, idiot didn't have any dialogue or plot ideas.

4) Billy calls creepy son about the ""house boy"" position and then interviews with stroke dad and creepy son. Of course just prior to the interview, Guy and Billy have a ridiculous musical dance scene where they go to get Billy's hair cut.  The actor playing Billy must have said he wasn't getting paid enough to get his locks clipped because his hair doesn't change one bit.  At stroke dad's house, creepy son does everything but dry hump Billy. They ask nothing about his background, ask for no references and say ""You sound perfect!!"" So does a serial killer.

5) Creepy son continues stalking Billy to the point of creating uncomfortable scenes for the viewer.  Isn't it perfectly normal for a 40 year old gay man to ply his father's 17-18 year old care-taker with margaritas and leer at the boy as he lies in his underwear in bed?  Billy appears to have no attraction to creepy son until he comes back from a night out with Guy and his friends crying.  Those awful, catty queens were mean enough to call him a ""cute nurse.""  The nerve!!  Creepy son makes his move and does dry hump Billy.  Two seconds later, after saying they love each other, creepy son goes in for the full molest.  The next morning they tell stroke dad about their love.  Stroke dad says, ""I know...I heard you last night"", conjuring up images of stroke dad giving his non-stroke hand a good workout the night before.

6) Billy's awful mother comes to L.A. to spend the day with her son. They shop all day and then return to her hotel room where she nonchalantly tells Billy, over cookies and milk, that his stupid father died a few days after Billy left.  Billy's little brother is now living with an aunt, but she hopes to get custody soon.  The mother character is as horrible as the lady portraying her.

7) Stroke dad dies, crazy rodeo clown drag queen cries.  A lot is said about friends to the end, friends forever, friends don't let queens look like that on camera, etc.  I'm not quite sure since I spent the entire scene with a bag over my head.  Clowns are scary!

8) After some silly melodrama regarding a kiss that wasn't, Billy and creepy son profess their eternal and creepy love.  It's hard to tell if Billy is crying because he does or doesn't want to kiss creepy son.  The chemistry is pulsating....or is that creepy son's eyelashes again?

9) The train wreck ends as crazy director wraps up movie by trying to connect everyone.  Awful mother and braindead Bozo the drag queen start up a gay dating service.  Guy inherits a country home and starts dating Billy's old best friend.  Creepy son and Billy ride off in a limo drinking more margaritas.  Creepy son dumps Billy when he turns 19 for being too old for him.  Says he's looking for more of a Zack Ephron type...circa 2004.  What....that didn't happen???  Well there's always room for a sequel....hint hint Greg Osborne.",1254096000,15,4964,4.532584269662921
2945108,1,B000VLLYFI,"This movie was so bad, I couldn't get through it in one sitting; I had to turn it off and come back to it twice more before slogging through to the end. The characters were extremely weak. The plot contrivances were grating as well; how can some eighteen year-old just happen to arrive, meet someone who is willing to put him up in his apartment, then not much later, this kid finds the man with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life? I'm not buying it.

The acting was way too melodramatic; with all the scenery-chewing, you would think it had been bankrolled by Bubble Yum.

After finally getting though this atrocity, I watched the extras as well; the writer/director comes off as awfully arrogant for someone who directs low-budget films. He isn't even willing to take off his sunglasses or his Bluetooth in the interview and ""cribs"" feature.

If you see this video being sold somewhere, leave it on the shelf, and back away.",1249257600,2,935,4.553571428571429
2945109,1,B000VLLYFI,This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen! The dialogue is horrible; the acting (if you can call it that) was atrocious; everything about it was such poor quality right on down the line. Do Not waste your money or your time watching it!,1217203200,2,242,4.170212765957447
2945110,1,B000VLLYFI,"Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen, and I tried really hard to find something worthwhile so as not to have considered it a total waste.

Steer clear of this one... there are so many other, much better made (and deserving) movies.",1217116800,,315,4.745454545454545
2945111,4,B000VLLYFI,"at its heart An angel called Billy is a sweet affecting little movie, that is let down by its editing and some aspects of its script...

the script can be far to self explanatory, we don't need the characters to tell us what they are doing when we can see them doing it onscreen , but it definatly transcends its faults... some of the acting is great , some of it a little dodgy (often from the same performers,which is where better editing would have benefited the Actors more) but .hey, at least they all have their heart in the right places and in the project.

 Dustin Belt is great as Billy, he hits the right notes as the innocent farm boy all the way through and the actor playing the stroke victim is also very good....its not easy to act with only half your facial muscles, and he does a great job, subtle and understated .

unlike 90 % of mainstream hollywood movies this one had me geussing which way it was going to end, and it was by its ending a pleasant surprise...a positive gay movie...! illd much rather buy this and watch the actors and director giving  it their best shot than Al Pacino in the vile  ""cruising"" anyday",1215043200,4,1137,4.339622641509434

2945114,1,B000VLLYFI,"Good Heavens, where do you begin to review the mess this movie is? The characters are horribly written, the script is painful and the acting is church-basement grade.

Run, don't walk, AWAY from this horrible,horrible movie. Go have gum surgery. You'll enjoy that more.",1206144000,2,269,5.113636363636363
2945115,3,B000VLLYFI,"The acting doesn't live up to it's standard. Even though the movie is making a political statement about being gay, the drag queen is terrible, Billy is mediocre at best, James and Guy are average. And the lady who owns the coffee shop is another representation of these women who try to engulf the gay cause all of by themselves (remember Debbie from ""Queer as Folks"".)

The story is about Billy who gets caught kissing with his best friend (a beautiful cowboy looking hunk, the guy on the movie box) in the beginning of the movie and gets booted out his farm ranch from a very abusive, alcoholic father (who has a bible next to him.) Billy hitchhikes to Los Angeles. There he meets Guy, a cute bus boy in a coffee shop. Guy offers his place to Billy temporarily. They show a scene of these two beautiful gay kids next to each other sleeping, nothing happens between them, com on give me a break.

Billy gets hired by James (a much older guy than Billy), the son of Mark, who had several strokes. James is a professional photographer, who just came out a relationship with a drug addict. Mark and his friend Tom, a drag queen go way back together. The setting up of the plot with these two characters was endless in the beginning of the movie.

Billy moves in with Mark and Mark becomes very fond of Billy as a caretaker. James also starts falling for Billy, and vice versa. Marks finally dies from his illness. Billy and James get married. Guy moves back to where Billy is from and hooks up with Billy's best friend. And yes, Billy gets re-acquainted with his mother who has been living in LA since she left her drunk husband.

The movie has its' moments, and it is a cute love story. Billy and Guy are gorgeous. I do not understand why this movie is so pricey, after all it is an American movie. Again the acting is bad. And this movie almost has an identical plot to another American movie ""The Journey of Jared Price."" In this movie Jared goes for the young kid which he met when he first arrived at LA (unlike Billy), instead of the older guy.",1204329600,4,2049,4.38421052631579
2945116,1,B000VLLYFI,"It's hard to know who shoulders the most blame - the writer, the actors, or the folks who released it? Terrible stereotypes, rehashed predictable plot and possibly the worst acting I have ever seen. I turned it on, then skipped the first couple of tracks hoping it would get better - it didn't. One the few movies ever that I have shut off part way through (and I watch many films). I did find a use for it though, put little sticky pads on the bottom of it and use it as a coaster - more respect than it probably deserves.",1202515200,7,523,4.188118811881188

The plot contrivances were grating as well; how can some eighteen year-old just happen to arrive, meet someone who is willing to put him up in his apartment, then not much later, this kid finds the man with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life? I'm not buying it.

The acting was way too melodramatic; with all the scenery-chewing, you would think it had been bankrolled by Bubble Yum.

After finally getting though this atrocity, I watched the extras as well; the writer/director comes off as awfully arrogant for someone who directs low-budget films. He isn't even willing to take off his sunglasses or his Bluetooth in the interview and ""cribs"" feature.

If you see this video being sold somewhere, leave it on the shelf, and back away.",1249257600,2,935,4.553571428571429
3179606,1,B000VLLYFI,This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen! The dialogue is horrible; the acting (if you can call it that) was atrocious; everything about it was such poor quality right on down the line. Do Not waste your money or your time watching it!,1217203200,2,242,4.170212765957447

3179608,4,B000VLLYFI,"at its heart An angel called Billy is a sweet affecting little movie, that is let down by its editing and some aspects of its script...

the script can be far to self explanatory, we don't need the characters to tell us what they are doing when we can see them doing it onscreen , but it definatly transcends its faults... some of the acting is great , some of it a little dodgy (often from the same performers,which is where better editing would have benefited the Actors more) but .hey, at least they all have their heart in the right places and in the project.

 Dustin Belt is great as Billy, he hits the right notes as the innocent farm boy all the way through and the actor playing the stroke victim is also very good....its not easy to act with only half your facial muscles, and he does a great job, subtle and understated .

unlike 90 % of mainstream hollywood movies this one had me geussing which way it was going to end, and it was by its ending a pleasant surprise...a positive gay movie...! illd much rather buy this and watch the actors and director giving  it their best shot than Al Pacino in the vile  ""cruising"" anyday",1215043200,4,1137,4.339622641509434

3179612,3,B000VLLYFI,"The acting doesn't live up to it's standard. Even though the movie is making a political statement about being gay, the drag queen is terrible, Billy is mediocre at best, James and Guy are average. And the lady who owns the coffee shop is another representation of these women who try to engulf the gay cause all of by themselves (remember Debbie from ""Queer as Folks"".)

The story is about Billy who gets caught kissing with his best friend (a beautiful cowboy looking hunk, the guy on the movie box) in the beginning of the movie and gets booted out his farm ranch from a very abusive, alcoholic father (who has a bible next to him.) Billy hitchhikes to Los Angeles. There he meets Guy, a cute bus boy in a coffee shop. Guy offers his place to Billy temporarily. They show a scene of these two beautiful gay kids next to each other sleeping, nothing happens between them, com on give me a break.

Billy gets hired by James (a much older guy than Billy), the son of Mark, who had several strokes. James is a professional photographer, who just came out a relationship with a drug addict. Mark and his friend Tom, a drag queen go way back together. The setting up of the plot with these two characters was endless in the beginning of the movie.

Billy moves in with Mark and Mark becomes very fond of Billy as a caretaker. James also starts falling for Billy, and vice versa. Marks finally dies from his illness. Billy and James get married. Guy moves back to where Billy is from and hooks up with Billy's best friend. And yes, Billy gets re-acquainted with his mother who has been living in LA since she left her drunk husband.

The movie has its' moments, and it is a cute love story. Billy and Guy are gorgeous. I do not understand why this movie is so pricey, after all it is an American movie. Again the acting is bad. And this movie almost has an identical plot to another American movie ""The Journey of Jared Price."" In this movie Jared goes for the young kid which he met when he first arrived at LA (unlike Billy), instead of the older guy.",1204329600,4,2049,4.38421052631579
3179613,1,B000VLLYFI,"It's hard to know who shoulders the most blame - the writer, the actors, or the folks who released it? Terrible stereotypes, rehashed predictable plot and possibly the worst acting I have ever seen. I turned it on, then skipped the first couple of tracks hoping it would get better - it didn't. One the few movies ever that I have shut off part way through (and I watch many films). I did find a use for it though, put little sticky pads on the bottom of it and use it as a coaster - more respect than it probably deserves.",1202515200,7,523,4.188118811881188

8219346,4,B000VLLYFI,"An angel named Billy. Just seen it on HERE! tonight and I have to say that this movie was a bit raw in dialog.  Acting is pretty good but I do have to say this movie has a tendency to drag in certain areas and not clear in other areas.  I decided to buy this movie because of the content though.  I felt that this movie needs a tweak or to, but a honest attempt to make a romantic love story and that is why I decided to give it 4 stars.

The beginning goes by very fast.  Alcoholic father finds his son kissing a gorgeous boy next door.  Father is a so called ""Christian"" with strong beliefs.  But in his drunken rage, kicks is son out of the house.

So Billy ventures to Los Angels where he meets makes a friend.  He then finds a ad on a bulletin for a live-in caretaker.  In character of Billy is honest, caring young man, quite new ""NEWBY"" who decides to take the care taking job.  When all that said and done, the man who hires Billy to caretake his ailing father turns into his lover.  Basic story in a nut shell.

Storyline had potential but my opinion; not either played or executed correctly I feel.  Actors a fairly good for the dialog they have.

I am old romantic so I decided to add this to my gay romance collection.  The actors are hot so why not? LoL  but in the end, I guess what caught me was the message they tried to send out.  Its jumpy in the movie, like they have many thoughts and go in several different directions that made me wonder while watching, what direction are they going.  If you like a romance, this story is ok.  If your looking for more than that, this movie would probably bore you.  I recommend watching it on ""LOGO"" or ""HERE!"" networks(s) first before buying it.

For me though, its a good romantic movie.",1294444800,3,1746,4.18018018018018

Full marks to them for going to the trouble of delineating all the problems in the film. When oh when are queer filmmakers going to STOP making bad gay films? (Eg, Slutty Summer and Bowser Makes a Movie.) When oh when are they going to STOP using terrible drag queens in key roles. Are they the money? Is that how the films get up? The boy Billy was a lovely kid and his situation was very sympathetic. It was him and him alone that kept me watching. And I'm sentimental enough to be pleased with the happy ending.
