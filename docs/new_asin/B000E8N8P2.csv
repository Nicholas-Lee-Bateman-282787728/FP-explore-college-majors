8107179,5,B000E8N8P2,I was pleased when this series came out.  I watched years ago when we got it on American TV and never forgot how I looked forward to each episode.  Now I have the entire set and am enjoying it again.  It's clever and scarey - very well written. Americans will recognize many of the actors though the settings are usually in England.,1346457600,,332,4.32258064516129
8107180,4,B000E8N8P2,"Here's a terrific collection of 25 stories culled from two of Dahl's more popular short story collections: ""Kiss Kiss"" and ""Someone Like You.""

These macabre, deliciously comic episodes first broadcast in the UK more than 25 years ago, are a cross between Hitchcock and O'Henry.

The creepy ""Royal Jelly"" is about a baby that won't gain weight.  John Gielgud and Joan Collins star in ""Neck."" It's about an art collector, his shrewish wife, their butler and a particular piece of modern sculpture to die for.  ""Edward the Conqueror"" is about a stray cat that enters the palatial Norfolk home of Dame Wendy Hiller and Joseph Cotton during the blustery winter. It reacts to Hiller's piano playing in such a way she thinks it's the reincarnation of Franz Liszt.  Susan George stars in a remake of Dahl's ""A Lamb to the Slaughter"" that was also among the most famous episodes of Alfred Hitchcock's decade earlier half hour series.

A droll Dahl introduces all the episodes.  His sly wit and clever, sophisticated writing make this anthology memorable and recommended.  From Acorn Media.",1290297600,3,1081,4.966666666666667
8107181,3,B000E8N8P2,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.

It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening.",1251158400,,316,6.348837209302325
8107182,5,B000E8N8P2,"After hearing good reports from friends in the UK, we bought this boxed set. We have been throoughly enertained by the half hour 'tales' which were all expertly written, and acted - in fact it was like experiencing a fine book of short stories, each with a lovely 'twist' at the end.

Such a pleasure to see the excellent British actors (albeit in their younger days) strutting their stuff. Each story kept us wondering what the surprise, 'unexpected' ending might be.

Each of these half hour shows can also provide an excellent 'filler' when there is nothing much to view on your local telly. I can only say that I'm glad I bought this set and will re-enjoy the expeince again in a few months time.

A must buy for anyone's DVD library.",1178064000,19,738,4.533834586466165
