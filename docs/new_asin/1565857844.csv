This should be labled a CD and not a DVD. A very boring approach.",1376611200,,133,5.090909090909091

7796539,2,1565857844,"The overall content of this title may be good, but I found it impossible to listen to for any length of time, even if I ignored the complete lack of visuals. Anyone who has done any reading of leading popular authors on Buddhism - Jon Kabat-Zinn, Pema Chodron, others - will find it frustratingly simplistic; anyone who has watched modern documentaries will find it substandard and unenlightening. It could have been recorded in the 1950s, before an audience of eighth-graders (Christian eighth-graders, at that). In this day and media age, there is no excuse for such lazy, dumbed-down format. It's acceptable only as an exercise in meditative self-discipline - not what I bought this product for. No excuse at all for the publisher's price.",1243382400,11,742,4.991935483870968
7796540,4,1565857844,"This course provides a solid introduction to Buddhism, and Malcom David Eckel manages to cover a surprising amount of ground in just 12 lectures. The course is definitely a full introduction to the subject, rather than just a primer. In this connection, I should note that Eckel also has a 24-lecture TTC course on Buddhism, but I haven't gone through that course yet, so I can't offer a comparison.

While I certainly liked this course, there were a few areas in which I thought the course could be improved, or at least different:

1. The course emphasizes religious and historical information (in considerable detail), rather than psychological, philosophical, and spiritual aspects. Like perhaps most Westerners, I would have preferred more emphasis on the latter, but I do recognize that this is a course in the ""Great World Religions"" series and is taught by a professor of religion, so I guess Eckel's scope meets his mandate.

2. As another reviewer noted, the video version of the course should have more visual elements. I also found that Eckel spends too much time looking at his notes, which was a bit annoying. For these reasons, the audio version might actually be preferable.

3. There was limited discussion on how Buddhism has developed in the West, and I think there should have been a full lecture devoted to that (at the end), given the presumably mostly Western audience for the course.

For the reasons noted above, I've deducted one star and assigned a 4-star rating, but I can still recommend the course to anyone interested in Buddhism. I'd also like to mention that the lecture notes for this course are particularly good, and they work well even on a stand-alone basis.

Also, I really enjoyed the discussion on the connections between Buddhism and Taoism, and I hope that TTC will develop a separate 24-lecture course on Taoism (with perhaps Mark Muesse as the lecturer).",1240012800,12,1899,4.91875
