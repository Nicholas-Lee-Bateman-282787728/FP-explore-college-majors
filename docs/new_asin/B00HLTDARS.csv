6171966,5,B00HLTDARS,My 7 year old granddaughter and myself loved this movie.  Don't know how it will be since it was 3d in the movies and not on the DVD but nonetheless an awesome movie,1414108800,,165,4.0
6171967,3,B00HLTDARS,"Whats it about?

A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. Based on the childrens novel Here Be Monsters by Alan Snow.

What did I think?

Despite delightfully quirky animation and a genuinely rich story the Boxtrolls is an odd film. Its a bit too scary for kids under six and anyone over 14 would be left feeling its too much of a kids movie. Thats quite a small niche market and the movie would have been stronger if theyd committed to either adults or kids.

The storyline is flat, the creatures are only sort of loveable and while the animation is a marvel its dirty feel isn't quite appealing. The movie is itself like a cardboard box  so much potential until you open it and discover there wasn't much in it.",1412380800,8,799,4.559440559440559
6171968,5,B00HLTDARS,"I have always been fascinated by stop motion animation whether it be animated for children or used in horror science fiction movies such as Harryhausen. In many ways it is a painstaking technique like coloring animation cells one by one and coloring many for a few seconds of film time, but it has a 3D look to it whether the process is shown in the 3D mode or not. It's a bit like looking at the 3D viewmaster reels of yesterday. So it's always a treat when one feature shows up to showcase another stop motion process and children stories are ripe for this sort of thing. Ever since the Hansel & Gretel Opera Fantasy of 1954 I have a special fondess as Harryhause did with his earliest discovery in King Kong and developed his own children fables on film as an instructional to develop his technique for later projects that made him what he is today.
The process has developed over the years with different studios, and frankly, I don't think Pixar counts because that is a whole other development.
Much like well made cell by cell colored animation, stop motion animation is simply striking and it never ceases to amaze me how life like dolls can be in the hands of the puppeteer. Even The Mad Monster Party stills gives me hours of pleasure, and I also appreciate Claymation as well.
The Boxtrolls fits right in with what stop motion is all about for family entertainment, and the first reviews warned agaisnt the darkness surrounding the villain, which I found no darker than the original queen of Disney's Snow White that abruptly announced to the henchman and the audience she wanted the heroine killed. That is dark indeed. The villain here simply wants to exterminate what the village people assume are dangerous to their lives so he may live in the limelight of the upper crust not knowing or caring that the boxtrolls are peaceful loving creatures, and this is where Eggs comes in to intervene with those plans. Well done, and can't wait to get my personal copy as soon as it's distributed.",1411948800,10,2001,4.623595505617978
6171969,5,B00HLTDARS,"Another absolute delight from Laika, the stop-motion animation house behind ParaNorman and the masterful Coraline, one of my favorite animated films of all-time.  The company's authorial touchtheir sophisticated and often dry sense of humor coupled with a potent love for the melancholy and the macabreis evident throughout The Boxtrolls.  The benevolent title monsters are urban scavengers.  At night, they emerge from their underground world and scour the streets in search of misplaced objects, and they integrate them into their strange and wonderful Rube Goldberg machines.  Among them lives Eggs, a human child so named because he, yes, dons a box emblazoned with the word ""eggs.""  His doting troll father figure is Fish.  Above ground, an ambitious and cruel man with the apt name of Archibald Snatcher (voiced with grotesquely artificial charisma by Ben Kingsley) wages an elaborate propaganda war against the trolls, painting a false portrait of them as flesh-devouring demons.  He is promised a white hat (a symbol of prestige and political influence in the fictional town of Cheesebridge) if he can capture and destroy each and every one of them.  Indeed, he does search for and imprison them, secretly utilizing the ones he catches as slave labor.

The way the dastardly Archibald Snatcher portrays the trolls as a malevolent, one-size-of-condemnation-fits-all ""other"" among the the mainstream and patrician populace, as well as his exploitation and extermination of them, is honestly evocative of the Holocaust.  It is the type of disturbing and provocative flourish which gives the film depth and dimension beyond the surface-level charm of its fast-paced action set pieces and its awe-inspiring visual design (the craft and patience stop-motion animation requires is always astounding).  It is a film overflowing with fascinating touches and worthy diversions.  Consider, for instance, Snatcher henchmen Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles, voiced by Nick Frost and Richard Ayoade, respectively.  Though a bit dim and easily led, they are always contemplating their place in the world and whether they are truly on the right side of history as they go on nocturnal troll hunts.  Their self-doubting antagonism is ingenious, playful, and, in a way, thought-provoking, and so is the overall film.",1411776000,43,2299,5.421348314606742
6171970,4,B00HLTDARS,"After two years of anticipation and a year without Pixar stepping into save 2014, we have had the opportunity to enjoy Laika's latest endeavor into the underground world of The Boxtrolls, we take a wildly refreshing and original look at the progress of stop-motion animation along with a heartfelt, quirky adventure comedy that is fit for the whole family.

Eggs, voiced by Game of Thrones' Isaac Hempstead-Wright, is an abandoned child who is raised by the title underground dwellers only to fall victim to an ongoing wave of extermination caused by a man named Archibald Snatcher, voiced by Iron Man 3's Ben Kingsley, who is willing to get rid of the Boxtrolls in an effort to win the city's fears and a white hat that the lord of the town owns.

The animation reaches the heights as being the most engaging stop-motion work recently such as 'Fantastic Mr. Fox and 'ParaNorman'. In many ways, the animation style and oddball antics featured are similar to what Aardman was doing in the past with 'Chicken Run' and the similarly-storied 'Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit'. However, unlike Wallace & Gromit, it is more cinema-friendly and not so stretched out. The action, suspense, and humor draw you in from the start of the film evenly spaced out in its 96 minute length creating what essentially is a roller-coaster ride. The voice talent was stellar in it too with Kingsley using a sinister Cockney accent to his advantage and especially from Nick Frost and Richard Ayoade who provide comical as well as surprisingly self-referential humor about the film's animation style at the end of the film. Finally, the film is even more commendable because of the steampunk, Victorian-era England look to it which on many instances is reminiscent of the film 'Delicatessen' with its underground society and mentally-twisted characters.

However, the film does not come without its faults. The film also suffers from a bit too much 'fluidity'. Normally, with stop-motion animation, it is supposed to look deliberately jerky and sometimes choppy because it is often a 'handy' technique while the way some of the movements of the characters or objects move almost CG-like which could be perceived as cheating the audience a little bit. Finally, and as expected, the film is not as ambitious as Laika's other works given it is much more lighthearted and safer. It feels like a film aimed at children and families exclusively.

In an age where the animation industry is controlled by now computer-animation heavyweights like Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks, it is refreshing to see an alternative-minded, stop-motion animated, slightly twisted adventure comedy in today's family film market. The Boxtrolls may not be in the same camp as Laika's legendary debut, Coraline, it is still however an entertaining and fine film that grows on you more than it does instantly.",1411776000,6,2867,5.054968287526427
6171971,4,B00HLTDARS,"The Boxtrolls is something of a mixed bag, one of those films you're either going to love or be somewhat annoyed by.  Coming from the same animation studio - Laika Entertainment - that did The Corpse Bride, Coraline and ParaNorman, your expectations should depend largely on whether or not you liked those films.  As someone who loved Coraline, it shouldn't come as a surprise that I like The Boxtrolls quite a bit.  Fans of the novel on which the film is based - Here Be Monsters! by Alan Snow - should be advised that substantial changes in the story were made for the movie.

The film opens in the visually stunning town of Cheesebridge, a pseudo-Victorian community that looks like the brainchild of a collaboration between Charles Dickens and Charles Addams with the occasional bit of steam-punk added in for good measure.  The upper class of Cheesebridge are distinguished by their conspicuous white stove-pipe hats and their even more conspicuous consumption of all things cheese, things that the lower class can only look upon and aspire to. But there is also an underclass of Cheesebridge, one that lives literally under the town, a race of grotesque-looking and highly inventive but harmless beings called boxtrolls, so-named because of their nature of picking boxes left out by the humans to wear and live in much in the same way hermit crabs pick the shells of other sea creatures to live in. And like hermit crabs which, when startled, quickly disappear into their shells, boxtrolls just as quickly disappear into their boxes to avoid being seen by humans.

The humans and the boxtrolls have a fairly quiet co-existence for the most part, the humans keeping to the surface and the boxtrolls staying below until nightfall when they come up and roam furtively about the streets, looking for cast-off things to use as parts for their mix-n-match creations. Until one night when a human toddler is supposedly abducted by boxtrolls, sending the humans into a fearful panic such that boxtrolls are no longer regarded as odd half-believed folk tales but as dangerous realities. In response to the outcry, the mayor of Cheesebridge, Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris) commissions social-climbing Archibald Snatcher (a deliciously over-the-top Ben Kingsley) to rid the town of boxtrolls by any means necessary, in return for which the desperately ambitious Snatcher will be granted his own white hat and entry into upper-class society. A rather questionable goal given that Snatcher has a highly unfortunate - and extremely nasty - food allergy that causes him to break out in distressingly gross ways at even the tiniest bite.

But we quickly learn that the boy at the heart of the panic has actually been lovingly adopted by the boxtrolls and raised by them, who call him Eggs after the label on the box he is found in and gradually grows up in. Which in fact is how all of the boxtrolls get their names, like Fish (Dee Bradley Baker) and Shoe (Steve Blum), the two boxtrolls Eggs is closest to. Now living below the surface, Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) grows up thinking that he's a boxtroll, joining them as he gets older into their nightly forays into the world above. Forays that are growing ever more dangerous as the relentless Snatcher and his fearsome (if frequently incompetent) henchmen - Mr. Trout (Nick Frost), Mr. Pickles (Richard Ayoade) and Mr. Gristle (Tracy Morgan) - whittle down the boxtrolls' numbers with all manner of devious traps and devices.

There's more than a bit of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book - the classic story of Mowgli, the boy raised by wolves - at the heart of The Boxtrolls. Much of the fun comes from watching as Eggs grapples with the fact that he might not be a boxtroll, much to his distress, and from watching him try to fit in as a human, knowing absolutely nothing about human culture.  Which all comes about when a girl named Winnie (Elle Fanning) inadvertently falls into the world below the town. Complicating matters further, she's the mayor's neglected daughter who's desperate in her own way for her father's attention. What ensues is Eggs coming to terms with who he is, and what he must become if he's to save his adopted community and the only family he knows.

The voice talent behind the characters is excellent. Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark from Game of Thrones) is perfect as Eggs, giving him the right touches of curiosity, awkwardness and ultimately courage the situations call for.  Ben Kingsley (Hugo, Gandhi) brings a gleefully scene-chewing level of over-the-top villainy to the story as Snatcher. A surprising and quite refreshing bit of comedy comes from Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead) and Richard Ayoade's (The IT Crowd) henchmen, Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles, who engage in a running philosophical exchange on the nature of good and evil and their place in the grand scheme of things even as they dutifully carry out Snatcher's orders. Dee Bradley Baker (American Dad!) and Steve Blum (Digimon) and the actors voicing the other boxtrolls do a remarkable job of giving the creatures a distinctive psuedo-language that consists largely of hisses, gurgles and growls with the occasional semi-intelligible word popping up here and there. Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead) shows up in a nice turn (that I can't say anything about that wouldn't amount to being a spoiler).

A particular delight though is Elle Fanning's (Maleficent) Winnie, who is most decidedly not your usual girl-in-distress and who quickly adopts a matter-of-fact take-charge approach to things, once she gets over her shock - and disappointment - at the boxtrolls turning out _not_ to be the ghastly, gore-dripping, bone-munching creatures she's heard so much about and wanted desperately to see. ""Where are the rivers of blood and mountains of bones?"" she demands at one point.  ""I was promised mountains of _bones_!""

There are also a surprising number of well-known voice actors who show up in supporting roles, including Maurice LaMarche, James Urbaniak, Cree Summer and Laraine Newman among them. The music, which adds nicely to the feel of the film, was done by Dario Marianelli (Anna Karenina, V for Vendetta, Atonement, Pride & Prejudice). And on a side note, The Boxtrolls Song was written by Eric Idle of Monty Python fame.

But an equal share of the credit has to go to the Laika stop-action animation team who the artists behind the imagined town of Cheesebridge and its various inhabitants. The level of detail is truly impressive, down to the littlest details like having the town crest - a knife and fork crossed over a wedge of cheese - cast on the town's manhole covers, something that might appear for only a second or two in the entire film. And even more impressive is how they bring the various characters' faces to life, giving each character a high degree of expressiveness that, coupled with the delivery of the voice actors, truly brings their personalities to life on the screen.

If The Boxtrolls comes up short or uneven in some areas, the reasons can arguably be found in the creative team at the helm, which while having obvious talent and a reasonable background in animation and story-telling, are rather less than stellar when it comes to actually heading up a film.  Anthony Stacchi's only previous experience as a director was as co-director on the so-so animated film Open Season (2006), while co-director Graham Annable's experience as a director was limited to some Bone and CSI video games (2005-2006).  On the screen-writing end, Irena Brignull's only real experience was on the made-for-TV movie Skellig: The Owl Man (2009).  Co-writer Adam Pava has the most to recommend him, having worked as a writer on several successful kids' TV shows like Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Out of Jimmy's Head and My Gym Partner's A Monkey, but this is his first attempt at doing screen-writing for a feature film. Having a surer, more experienced hand at the helm might've upped the overall quality a notch or two. But all that said, The Boxtrolls is still a lot of fun and impressive in its stop-action animation and the levels of detail involved.

One other note: make sure you stay as the credits roll for a cute little extra scene with Trout and Pickles carrying on yet another existential exchange but with a bit of comic perspective added as the camera pulls back. It's definitely worth catching.

Highly recommended if you love quirky, off-beat stories and affectionately grotesque animation and characters.",1411689600,41,8504,4.945339873861247
6171972,2,B00HLTDARS,"Everybody loves and respects the stop-motion animated films by Laika, the talented Portland, OR animators behind Coraline and ParaNorman. Those two films achieved great critical acclaim; widely praised for both their beauty and darker, supernatural themes. Neither was a huge box office hit, though, which must be frustrating given the thousands of man hours the studio puts in and never let us forget. Their latest film The Boxtrolls is perhaps their first stab at doing something that will achieve wider acceptance, but those who appreciated their more mature work may find it lacking.

The Boxtrolls is, like everything Laika does, exceptionally gorgeous and detailed. The amount they are able to put in to every scene is mind-blowing when one considers the time it takes to move each figure a single frame. And this world is the weirdest they've conjured up yet. The fictional sorta-Victorian town of Cheesebridge is a peculiar place where cheese in all its many forms is revered, especially by those of higher social standing, who all wear white hats as indicators of their stature. Underneath the city live the Boxtrolls, a family of ogre-ish creatures who emerge in the night looking for tossed aside trinkets and knick-knacks. They've been portrayed as monsters that kidnap children and eat them, a story concocted after a young boy's disappearance. He's actually quite alive, named Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) and living with the boxtrolls who raised him. Eggs has no idea that he's actually human, which galls Winnie (Elle Fanning), the daughter of Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris). Threatened by the Boxtrolls' existence, Portley-Rind has hires devious exterminator Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) to finish them off. Snatcher's all too happy to do it in exchange for receiving a white hat so he can eat cheese with the upper crust of society, this despite a chronic (and utterly disgusting) inability to tolerate the stuff. When Snatcher proves too good at his job, capturing nearly all of the Boxtrolls, it's up to Eggs to brave the city and find them.

Laika has never shied away from tackling complex subjects, and The Boxtrolls is their most overt social commentary yet, which is a very good thing. While it's toned down for younger audiences, the film celebrates family diversity in the familial bond between Eggs and the boxtrolls who care for him most, Shoe and Fish. The closeness between them is never in question, and those paying attention will note that both of Eggs' boxtroll ""parents"" are males. It's one of those small details that kids will grow into and appreciate. Laika has always been one to embrace its ""outsider"" status in Hollywood and their films have often embraced a certain counter-culture spirit. The Boxtrolls is no different in its celebration of diversity and skewering of hierarchal societies. These qualities are enjoyable but muddled by an overstuffed screenplay that tacks on one conflict after another. There's Eggs' reluctance to leave his boxtroll upbringing and embrace his human side; Snatcher's scheming to climb the social ladder; Winny's desire to gain her daddy's favor; and the emergence of a daffy inventor (Simon Pegg) with very close ties to Eggs. It's simply too much going on, and yet there are still too many times when the film drags to a screeching halt, and that may have something to do with it not being all that funny. This may be a matter of personal taste but the Python-esque, dry British wit isn't everyone's slice of cheddar. Throw in giant mechanical robots, gross-out gags, oversized wheels of cheese, Snatcher as a drag queen, and the humor is too childish and busy to come together as satisfying as it should.

Nothing can take away from how beautiful the world co-directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi have helped create. It truly looks like no other Laika film which is really saying something. Combining steampunk with the offbeat style of Tim Burton, its an imaginative visual stunner that you will never get tired of looking at. What Laika is able to accomplish on a technical level is to be admired as much as their social concerns, but The Boxtrolls just doesn't resonate in quite the way we're used to from them.",1411689600,15,4209,5.044540229885057

6172475,5,B00HLTDARS,"This is a great animation!
It's not all for kids thought. It's more for adults just like <NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHIRSTMAS> or <CORALINE>. Also if you like movies like <THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN><DELLICATESSON> that is directed by Marc Caro,  Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
A bit dark and very visually stunning high contrast, Production design award worthy animation film.
If you expect something like Disney skip this one.
The story is also pretty original.
There are a bumch of monstrous looking but very fragile kind that are living in a box. It's like a cloth.
They are shy and delicate people- people? well,..
They are known to human as man eater or baby stealer or carnival at best but in fact they are not. They are some kind of victim from the society cause they are living in the dark because of the false image.

They meets this boy EGGS who was abandoned when a boy and keeps him as their son or something.
He is not a boxtroll but they gives him a small box and he thinks that he is one of them.
One day he meets a girl. Yes there is always a girl.
She is a daughter of a rich powerful man A Lord and slowly figures out that he is one of the human kind.
Then he figures out that his true father was sacrificed by that lord's colleague  Archibald Snatcher a true evil.
They are fake known to human because the Archibald and other evil made them their image that way.
Now there comes a time that Archibald decides to get rid of all the boxtrolls and for the first time for the help of the girl Winnie Portley-Rind , boxtrolls stand up and fight against the Archilabald and their gangs.

The story is good the visual is pure amazing that my eyes were totally blind by it.
I will have to watch this again and again.
It felt like watching the movie <CORALINE>. The same old feeling came back to me.

It's sad that this movie was not a big hit at the boxoffice because it didn't found the proper audience of course the stroy was too dark for kids or because the adults hesitated to watch an animation alone not bringing their children.

It needs to be re-known and the new treatment too.",1472688000,,2077,4.34020618556701

I had every intention of returning it but before I could, the company emailed me to inquire about my satisfaction. I told them my copy was worthless and they apologized and thanked me for giving them the opportunity to fix their foul up. They gave me a choice to get a full refund or obtain a replacement DVD. I elected to get a replacement. I gave them my feedback on a Saturday and they replied to me on Sunday!  I had my replacement copy in hand by Wednesday.  Their quality control could use some improvements but their customer service was impressive. I would probably purchase from this seller again.

Box Trolls is surprisingly entertaining. It's a dark comedy so it may not be appropriate for kids younger than 5 or 6. It's funny and original.

6172647,4,B00HLTDARS,"Boxtrolls is one of those kooky movies like something Tim Burton would come up with.  It is kind of a charming little story about a young boy named Egg being raised by a bunch of tinkering trolls who live in boxes underneath a city.  The trolls only come out at night and are pretty much harmless.  They are more or less curious about everything that goes on in the world above and scavenge items to make new gadgets.  The evil villains are actually the exterminator humans in the red hats.

I would say the movie would be suited for children 10 and up any younger than that and the kids might be scared or a little freaked out, especially the scenes with the lead villain and his cheese allergy.  Films have been done like this before but the computer 3D animation is fluid and looks great like the old claymation style.  The movie has a unique feel to the film and is pretty interesting.  There was no real slow or boring spots in the movie and it seemed to be very well paced throughout the film.

Egg meets a girl named Winnie and together they set out to free the captured box trolls.  The movie is a good light hearted affair with a few laughs here and there.  I would rate it probably 4 stars for originality but nowhere near a 5 star great animated movie.  It is fun watching the trolls use their boxes to get around and be mobile.  Egg and Winnie both have a courageous spirit that seems infectious.  Kind of reminds me of Pinocchio in reverse.  I would recommend the movie though for something different than the norm.",1459296000,,1528,4.368794326241135

Frankly, I'm amazed by the amount of work, attention to detail, and high quality of this movie.  I wish more people would support movies like this, which are quirky, original (so sick of all of the sequels and retreads coming from Hollywood these days!), and make you think.

Although the kids enjoyed the movie, I actually think the target audience was probably a little older.  I think I enjoyed it the most out of the 3 of us:)",1457827200,,697,4.775

THE BOXTROLLS is Academy Award nominated stop-motion adventure. The Boxtrolls are monsters, who live underneath the charming streets of Cheesebridge, who crawl out the sewers at night to steal the towns children and fine cheese. At least, thats the legend the townspeople have always believed.

In truth, the Boxtrolls are a community of loveable oddballs who are raising an abandoned human boy named Eggs [Isaac Hempstead Wright] as one of their own. When the Boxtrolls are targeted by a villainous a local pest exterminator, Archibald Snatcher [Sir Ben Kingsley] who is bent on eradicating them, Eggs must venture above ground to save his unique family of Boxtrolls, where he teams up with an adventurous local rich girl Winnie [Elle Fanning] to save not only the Boxtrolls, but the soul of Cheesebridge.

Andrews 3D Blu-ray Review: In THE BOXTROLLS [2014] we have a villainous troll catcher sets out to eradicate the underclass and join the cheese-eating elite in the latest from the animation people who were behind the animation films of 'Coraline' and ParaNorman before it, the film was hatched out of artisanal Oregon-based animation studio LAIKA, where Travis Knight serves as CEO President. And like those earlier animation features, which managed more successfully to juggle dark with light, this one appears unafraid to target a more limited audience than most wide-release CGI animated films. Its demographic seems likely to mirror a younger age range of the source material, especially related to the British childrens author Alan Snows fantasy adventure novel entitled, Here Be Monsters! Who not only wrote it but also did over 500 black-and-white illustrations for it as well and the book was published in 2005 in the UK and in the US the following year.

Here we have a family event with a totally brilliant and inventive animated film that introduces audiences to a new breed of family called The Boxtrolls, which is a community of quirky, mischievous creatures who have lovingly raised an orphaned human boy named Eggs [Isaac Hempstead-Wrigh]) in the amazing cavernous home they've built beneath the streets of Cheesebridge. When the town's villain, Archibald Snatcher [Sir Ben Kingsley], comes up with a plot to get rid of the Boxtrolls, Eggs decides to venture above ground, ""into the light,"" where he meets and teams up with fabulously feisty Winnifred [Elle Fanning]. Together, they devise a daring plan to save Eggs' family.

The people of Cheesebridge live in fear of the Boxtrolls ever since that day that Baby Trubshaw was believed to be taken by the Boxtrolls in the dead of night. Ever since then, come night fall the town of Cheesebridge becomes completely deserted as a curfew takes place and the people of Cheesebridge hide in their homes. This curfew of course is perfect for the Boxtrolls as it means that they can roam the streets and alleys searching through bins and boxes for clocks, gears and other bits of machines that the folks of Cheesebridge throw away. The Boxtrolls you see are sort of tinkerers and engineers; they love to put things together, making new things out of the things that others throw away.

Between the stinky, the gross, the wretched, and the evil sits the adorable Boxtrolls, an anti-Pinocchio set in a snooty British-ish town obsessed with the extravagance of cheese. Underneath them in a mechanical sewer are the Boxtrolls, timid, tame, and thieving. They love garbage. The Boxtrolls teaches plenty in this scenario. Income gaps, the endlessly imbecility of politicians, the superficiality of wealth, the complexities of being a good person; its a loaded gun of entertainment metaphors and as unusually modest with colour as to set an unusually glum tone for a feature destined to be more aimed at younger fare, but I still enjoyed with an older out look of this animated film.

With the Boxtrolls, their joy, bugs and boogers are their delicacy. Elegant cheese is nostril harming and prone to causing allergies. The Boxtrolls is much in its own world where kids shout, Eww! and adults wonder what happened to their gentle animated delights and probably without realising a prior generation grew up on the bliss of people being slimed on national TV. So thats where we are: Worms and flies, sewers and stench, with a dash of mould. The Boxtrolls are friendly critters, but they love all that rotten stinky stuff. They hide in boxes and name themselves after the products screened onto the front of their comfy cardboard clothes, names like Fish and Shoe. In their company too is a child, who to the outside world is dead. The child was allegedly ripped apart and mauled by the snivelling maws of the sewer troll beasts, or so they say. Or rather, they're told. This town, known as Cheesebridge, even holds a celebration to honour the supposedly lost child as a warning of the Boxtrolls threat and then add in a little propaganda metaphor too.

Where the Boxtrolls is headed is inevitable, as the Boxtrolls wish for their freedom and Eggs [Isaac Hempstead Wright], a young human changeling, as one of their own beneath the city streets and this boy will eventually become a hero, but it becomes more complex and rich than something so droll on its surface. The Boxtrolls villain, blatantly named Archibald Snatcher [Sir Ben Kingsley], brings with him three thugs to every night of the Boxtrolls snatching. Two of them are uneasily conflicted about their current status as bad guys, adding depth to an otherwise pale fairy tale with simple battle lines. Theres more humour than heart to THE BOXTROLLS, but there are a couple of poignant moments thanks to the bond between Eggs and Winnie, charmingly voiced by Elle Fanning, who honed a reasonable English accent in the film Maleficent. Winnie is a true scene-stealer, ghoulishly revelling in the legend of the child-snatching Boxtrolls.

All is told via the brilliant production studio LAIKA and their exquisite stop motion artistry, building a miniaturised world of unbelievable craftsmanship by hand. Its so often meticulously detailed and ridiculously complex as to challenge what we once knew of the animation form. Their solutions are genius, their form is flawless, and their style is unmatched. Its so often meticulously detailed and ridiculously complex as to challenge what we once knew of the animation form. Their solutions are genius, their form is flawless, and their style is unmatched. The visuals are totally awesome and dazzling at the same time, the voices are very expressive, and the end-credits sequence offers a laugh-out-loud appraisal of the madness of the animators labour-intensive craft.

Certainly, the challenges of stop motion can supersede story and its all too easy to fall under the trance of such beauty in motion. But not for Boxtrolls which carries exuberant personality as it gives life to indifferent citizens and playfully enjoyable critters. Often, there are no words. Unknowingly adopted by the Boxtroll human Eggs [Isaac Hempstead Wright] is introduced without dialog, merely some indecipherable mumbling known as Trollese. They party, they laugh. And, they enjoy their existence for what, and who they are. In between everything else, that is the Boxtrolls kindest message and The Boxtrolls has more humour than heart, but should please adults and children alike.

There is a totally captivating sequence during the end credits of THE BOXTROLLS thats more or less a hand-drawn capsule version of the entire story, accompanied by an airy cover of the Pete Seeger hit Little Boxes performed by the Loch Lomond band [Loch Lomond is a band based in Portland, Oregon, United States that was started as a solo recording project of Ritchie Young in 2003]. Thats followed by two characters who share an existentialist bent and amusingly voiced by Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost, imagining a world in which their every movement is manipulated by unseen giants, before cameras pan back to show producer and lead animator Travis Knight tinkering away. Those few playful minutes are packed with charm, wit and an infectious enthusiasm for the magic of animation and all the qualities that makes this brilliant 3D animation film a delight and a joy to view.

LAIKA has never made a poor looking animated film. Their output includes CORALINE and the 2012 gem ParaNorman, although THE BOXTROLLS is so very different, this is a much bleaker picture, but have fun and frolics on the way. While their previous work often exploded in tremendous colour, short of an orange-ish heavy third act finale, much of THE BOXTROLLS is slightly muted and hues are weakened into a dusty pattern without the intention of depth. Black levels are sprayed with a bit of London fog.

And of course, that is okay. In terms of tonalities, the look is where it should be despite lacking the powerhouse pop now expected of animation. Instead, the Boxtrolls earns itself praise for resolution. Mini clothes, dirty floors, hair; they're flawless. Digital photography and literally they use high-end Canon still cameras, not video and captures the nuance of each puppet. Background details, especially town buildings which recall the exaggerated forms of German expressionism very lightly anyway, stretch vertically. Each brick or weed is fully visible. Universal Pictures encoding work is doubly astonishing. Any fine lines maintain their integrity without aliasing.  But seeing THE BOXTROLLS in 3D makes watching this animated film well worth it and all in all will be perfect viewing for all the family, so give it a try, you will not be disappointed. The humour in this film is distinctly British in nature, so be prepared not to have the same sort of laughs you'd usually get from a PIXAR or Disney animated films. So ultimately what I'm saying is that THE BOXTROLLS was a really wonderful lovely surprise, a thoroughly entertaining animated film with endearing characters that you'll learn to love as the film progresses. Also stay for the end credits, you'll be rewarded with a neat look at how stop-motion animation is done all the while two of the goons Richard Ayoade and Simon Pegg has an existential moment. It's really cool and silly at the same time.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  As we have come to expect from a LAIKA stop-motion production of THE BOXTROLLS and seeing the Boxtrolls roaming the dark streets and alleys of this 3D Blu-ray disc that has a magnificent and stunning first-rate 1080p encode image that will have viewers believing in this a real fantasy world. One of the presentation's better aspects is surprisingly the lack of gimmick shots, but a couple action sequences break through the screen with the occasional trick effect, but the real focus and attention is placed on creating a realistic 3D world, which it does really admirably. The dark streets of the fictional Cheesebridge penetrate deep into image, forming an awesome sense of depth, an elongated passageway that one can actually feel turns the corner. Separation between buildings and objects is superb while characters have a nice roundness to them and their noses in particular protrude and extend from the faces of each character. Presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the video is also razor sharp with excellent detailing in every scene, even those with a thick, hovering fog, of which there are several. The stitching on the clothes is plainly visible; we can make out every thread and seam is precise and evident, allowing viewers to really appreciate the level of work that went into designing this elaborate world. The primary colours are vibrant and sumptuous while cleanly-rendered secondary hues provide warmth and vigour to the comedy, making this stop-motion flick an outstanding watch. Interestingly this Blu-ray of THE BOXTROLLS, especially in the 2D version, actually detracts from the extensive stop-motion animation, as the purity of the high definition image actually, at times, makes LAIKAs hard work CGI look absolutely stunning in 3D. Whereas I think its the first time I have felt seeing it in 2D Blu-ray hinders rather than help this brilliant animated film, so maybe if you are not into 3D animation, then maybe the best option is to only purchase and watch the DVD, as it is pointless to get the 3D Blu-ray disc? Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  THE BOXTROLLS has an excellent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix, that has a grand time filling the home cinema space with music and atmospheric effects. The subwoofer gets a surprising good amount of work here, particularly from ideas like the Snatchers giant robot or an impossibly large wheel of Brie. However, the rear speakers are employed on several occasions, primarily and most notably during action sequences where effects enjoy discrete directionality and excellent panning. Dynamic range is distinct with clean definition of the tiniest object clanging and ringing across a very well-balanced soundstage. The low-end is ample and robust, providing adequate weight and rumble to certain scenes, and dialogue is intelligible with clean intonation in the conversations, making this an excellent sound mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Preliminary Animatic Sequences [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [17:28] Here we have six separate animated sequences we view mainly animated sketches in Black-and-White and some colour, with the music score from the film in the background. We get to see in great detail what the filmmakers were initially thinking about various parts of the story. Theres actually an alternate opening here, with a different view of how Eggs was taken by the Boxtrolls. The actual six separate animated sequences are as follows: Baby In The trash; Eggs In The Underworld; Man On A Horse; Trubshaws Inventorium; Cheese Shop and Tea and Cheese. You have three choices, one you play with the audio commentary by Directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi, secondly without the audio commentary or thirdly Play All.

Special Feature: Dare To Be Square: Behind the Scenes of The Boxtrolls [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [32:48] This is a collection of five features: Voicing The Boxtrolls; Inside The Box; The Big Cheese: Allergy Snatcher; Deconstructing the Dance and Think Big: The Mecha Drill. The first of these obviously focuses on the actors voicing the characters, with an interesting revelation that Sir Ben Kingsley likes to read his lines while lying on the chair vertically to get that guttural quality. The other four features cover the work of the brilliant animators working behind-the-scenes and seeing how the little boxes work, particularly what relates to major sequences like Snatchers allergy attack, the virtuoso ballroom dance scene and the final battle with Snatchers monster Mecha Drill robot, all in all this is a truly wonderful feature. But as you go through all  five features, you get contributions from the following people: Travis Knight [Producer, Lead Animator]; Grahame Annable [Director]; Anthony Stacchi [Director]; Isaac Hempstead Wright [Voice of Eggs]; Elle Fanning [Voice of Winnie]; Jared Harris [Voice of Lord Portley-Rind]; Sir Ben Kingsley [Voice of Snatcher]; Richard Ayode [Voice of Mr. Pickles]; Nick Frost [Voice of Mr. Trout]; Tracy Morgan [Voice of Mr. Gristle]; David Bleiman Ichioka, P.G.A. [Producer]; Toni Collette [Voice of Lady Portley-Rind]; Steve Blum [Voice of Shoe]; Dee Bradley [Voice of Fish]; Simon Pegg [Voice of Herbert Trubshaw]; Brian McLean [Replacement Animation & Engineer]; Georgina Hayns [Character Fabrication Supervisor]; Brad Schiff [Animation Supervisor]; Oliver Jones [Animation Rigging]; David Vandervoort [Story Artist]; Jeff Croke [CG Facial Animator]; Tim Yates [Lead Replacement Animation Specialist]; Edie Ichioka, A.C.E. [Editor]; Dario Marianelli [Music Composer]; Deborah Cook [Costume Designer]; Brian Vant Hul [Visual Effects Supervisor]; Gerald Svoboda [Animation Rigging]; Paul Martinez [Model Builder] and Curt Enderle [Art Director].

Special Feature: Featurettes [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:00] This is a shorter collection of five separate features and consists of the following: The Nature of Creation; Trolls Right Off The Tongue; Allergic to Easy; Lets Dance and On the Shoulders of Giants. These cover some of the same ground as the longer previous features, and appear to be the promotional video that was posted on the internet when the animated film hit the cinemas in 2014 and is a FOCUS Features / LAIKA Production. As before, we get lots of contributions from people like: Travis Knight [CEO + Lead Animator, LAIKA]; Graham Annable [Director, THE BOXROLLS], Anthony Stacchi [Director, THE BOXROLLS], Ollie Jones [Rigging Supervisor, THE BOXROLLS], Curt Enderle [Art Director, THE BOXROLLS], Steve Emerson [VFX Supervisor, THE BOXROLLS], Steve Blum [Voice of Shoe]; Dee Baker [Voice of Fish]; David Vandervoort [Facial Animation Designer, LAIKA]; Peg Serena [Facial Animation Supervisor, LAIKA]; Brian mcLean [Rapid Prototype, LAIKA] and  Georgina Hayns [Creative Supervisor of Puppet Fabrication, LAIKA].

Audio Commentary: Feature Commentary with Directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi: Here Directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi introduce themselves and talk about the famous British childrens author Alan Snows fantasy adventure novel entitled, Here Be Monsters! that they based the animation film on, but they point out that the start of the animation film is totally different to the start of novel and they call it the Prologue and was the last sequence to be filmed, on top of that in the book they had thousands of characters, which could not of been conceived in the film, as the logistics would have been a nightmare to create for this animation film. But what they did want to do is to make the film look like the French Graphic Illustrations of Nicolas de Crcy, that they felt were inspirational art and if you want to know what they are on about, then check out his web site, as you will see why the buildings in the animation film are like they are and are of such brilliant interpretation and they both praise the LAIKA Art Department in bringing the French Graphic Illustrations of Nicolas de Crcy to life for this LAIKA animated film. This scene-specific commentary finds both directors in a happy mood as they go through the animated film you are viewing. They each take a fair amount of time to discuss the specifics of each character, as well as the evolution of the animated films story. When we first get to see the baby Boxtrolls named Eggs, you hear him hiccup, and the voice of the small boy was done by Max Mitchell, and at the time of the recording of the voice Max had a hiccup fit, so they decided to keep it in, as it gave the baby Boxtrolls a more human characteristics. When we get to the ballroom scene, they both comment on what a difficult scene it was to animated and a total logistic nightmare, with so many elements into the technicalities of producing something totally seamless and realistic. But when we come to seeing the Mecha Drill in daylight, it was an even more logistic nightmare to animate, but they praise the animation crew for all their hard work in making it look really good and realistic. As we get to the end of the animated film, especially the Credits, Directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi praise most of the people you see mentioned in the credits and what a wonderful professional job they did on THE BOXTROLLS and to find out that over 400 people work their heart out in producing such a brilliant animated film. So all in all the audio commentary was fascinating and you can hear how much Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi in making THE BOXTROLLS and they hope you have enjoyed their audio commentary.

BONUS: Exclusive to this 3D Blu-ray UK Release it has a beautiful designed 3D printed slip cover.

Finally, THE BOXTROLLS is another smart contribution from the stop-motion dream factory at LAIKA. It is really good work all the way around and a pleasure to watch. It starts slow, but it gets better and better as it moves along, ending with a virtuoso display of animation and a lovely final parting gag before things fade out. The 3D Blu-ray offers this animated film in both 3D and 2D high definition, and of course as I have already stated that my ultimate preference being the 3D Blu-ray without doubt that arrives with spectacular video and an excellent audio presentation. There is a generous amount of special features are also included. This brilliant animated 3D film gives great pleasure and is a brilliant all round family entertainment. Highly Recommended!

6172884,3,B00HLTDARS,"I like how no one died in it except one and I understand how hard stop animation is hard to make and that is why I gave it one more star then I would have.

Boxtrolls are supposed to be evil, but they're not.  Bad people are trying to kill them, a little boy was adopted by them and he has to try to save them.  Really another movie from the makers of Coraline that is too creepy for children.

I tried to look passed the many plot holes, like if a child is raised by little trolls that never speak, he wouldn't be able to speak or if a man had been hanging upside down for 10 years he would have died.  But there were too many plot holes for me to find this enjoyable.",1448409600,,669,3.889705882352941

6172887,2,B00HLTDARS,"Despite nice animation and careful design this one came and went. I suspect the trailer was a bad sell; my kids expressed no interest whatsoever after the preview. In comparison, they went nuts after we saw the Paranorman preview.

This one seemed geared towards a too young crowd and emphasized an overly cute ambiance.  That in itself is strange because ultimately the film fails in terms of being too grotesque rather than too cute. It does attempt to make the troll design ugly/cute (in my eyes it does not succeed,)  but the rest of the characters, even if carefully designed are quite repellent:There are repeated sequences where a horrible looking male with a gigantic, distended gut dresses in drag dances and sings and unbelievably fools and enchants the whole community.

The use of grotesque characters in ""children's"" entertainment is nothing new, Carroll contracted Tenniel because he wanted a certain effect in his books. But where Tenniel balanced an extreme character such as the a Queen of Hearts with a fairly normal human looking Alice, Laika's designs are all quite grotesque with no balance between normalcy and monstrousness.

This worked fairly well in Panorman with its themes of death and disease*, but it doesn't quite work in Boxtrolls, a movie which seems to unnecessarily complicate a simple Jungle Book type of story where an orphan is raised by trolls (Boxtrolls, that is.)

Despite being fairly simple this film still felt somewhat like the schizophrenic The Tale of Desperaux, though it is certainly not as bad as that one.

Regardless of the fairly standard and predictable story, this could have succeeded with better characterization: one of the better aspects of the film is a pair of stooges who are too dim to realize they are the bad guys - but there is too little of this: The villain has a completely ridiculous motivation, the lead is bland and reactive, the love interest is bland, the fathers are bland, etc.

The other components that work well, although they truly are ultimately to the movie's overall detriment, since they go against the general sweet flavor of the story, are instances where the film, which has been carefully attempting to straddle the line between cuteness and ugliness to no good effect, goes for the gusto** and shows us scenes of leeches, food being spit up or of extreme allergic reactions to lacteous products.

Despite a fairly good public response on the whole I cannot recommend, other than for stop motion & animation completists.

*All characters are extreme caricatures and there is an almost fetishistic emphasis on unnaturally large buttocks and the female chassis.

** The best scene in Paranorman featured a dead uncle with a nastily active tongue - gross out, for sure.",1448236800,2,2754,4.991266375545852

6173424,5,B00HLTDARS,"A truly masterful animated movie. Wonderful, rich voice acting. Beautiful, creative sets. Original, fun, surprising spin on a familiar story.

I would call this a blu-ray must. Stop Motion Animation is always stunningly beautiful on blu-ray, and this title is no exception. The creativity and originality displayed here is unequaled by any other Stop-Motion movie. If nothing else, It's worth the money simply to look at.

Having said that, the characters are incredibly beautiful and intriguing. I was sold from the first 5 minutes. The Boxtrolls are hysterically fun to watch and listen to, and Eggs is an effectively endearing character. I was hooked from the first frame to the last.

The only problem with the movie might have been that it had the obligatory, final-bad-boss-battle scene for its climax, but I was okay with it, because it was populated by Boxtrolls and an evil villain voiced by Ben Kingsley, so I really had no room for complaint.

One of my favorite movies ... a must watch.",1436400000,,998,4.958083832335329

It is probably the darkest movie I have ever seen made for children! It seems very sadistic and dark, Great material for nightmares!
While we were all watching the movie my kids did not even move an inch because they were so shocked and spooked! At the end of the movie they both came up to me and asked me to never watch this movie again because it was scary and that ""we hated mommy""

While I wouldn't recommend this movie to the youngest of children, I believe any over the age of seven would easily grasp the meaning and not be terrified if the innuendo.

Boxtrolls is an enjoyable movie but the ending is very much anticlimatic.  It was almost as if the producers said, ""We're out of money, stop where you are"".  Other than that, quite fun and unexpected.",1433635200,,578,4.466666666666667

This is an ok movie, story is kind of lame at times but the humor makes up for it. The end of the movie really makes little sense and seems as if the writers were stuck for an ending. Has nice steampunk elements to it. British animation has always been a favorite of mine. The girl is a major brat, I couldn't stand her. Her unattentive father was no better. Moral is hidden in there well but if you look there is one. Honestly the humor and the characters, trolls mainly, are what kept my attention.

As for the film version..........the artwork is fabulous.  But, the story is very dark and very grim, given over to grotesque characters, mob rule, children in jeopardy (at one point the villain attempts to burn a little boy in a furnace as the town cheers him on.  The overriding cynicism involved makes one wonder if the filmmakers even like children.  More loving care was placed on promoting the hideous villain (Ben Kingsley as Archibald Snatcher) as their centerpiece; the box trolls are secondary, if that.  The predominant theme of the piece is avarice (murder being the only way to achieve one's lofty goals.  In this case a hat).  There's even a song and dance number extolling the virtues of hatred.  I find it odd that a film aimed solely at children focuses so intently on the piteous nature of people bent on destroying/killing those they don't understand and/or approve of (political satire for children?).  The villain has a 'squishing machine' to take care of the undesirable.  I shudder to think that this is what passes for humor.",1431907200,2,1196,4.785365853658536

6173961,5,B00HLTDARS,"Being rather late in the review process (there are already over 900 Amazon reviews of this film), I won't repeat all of the positive attributes given to this film by others.  So I'll attempt to add something new to the conversation.

This is the rare animated feature that has a wonderful (and cohesive) story line, and which is absent of any heavy-handed populist agenda messages.  (Sorry, no ""girl power"" messages here.)  The only moral seems to be, ""don't judge folks based on what you hear from others.""

It's delightful to know that Claymation animation is still alive.  How long this art form will last remains to be seen, but I loved the closing sequence where the reformed ""minions"" discuss the possibility that they are being manipulated by a greater power, which is progressively overlaid with a time-lapse sequence of the animators moving the figures during their metaphysical discourse (which gives some very small idea of just how much effort is really required in order to perform Claymation).  And the end song by Eric Idle (of ""Monty Python"" fame) is a real brain worm.

This is a movie I can watch (and have watched) again and again, looking for subtleties in story line, background actions, and dialog each time - and every time it just gets better and better (sort of like the 1939 version of ""The Wizard of Oz"", my all-time favorite film.)",1430092800,,1359,4.802575107296137
6173962,5,B00HLTDARS,HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT I GIVE SELLER A+++++,1430092800,,41,5.0
6173963,2,B00HLTDARS,"While I do enjoy the CGI output from studios like Pixar and DreamWorks, I do have a soft spot for traditional animation and its quirkier unloved cousin, stop-motion animation.  I'm no purist demanding a return to hand-drawn and hand-sculpted animation or accusing Disney or DreamWorks of selling out by going for CGI, I still find a charm to hand-done animation that CGI has a hard time replicating.  And stop-motion animation, done right, can be just as charming and inventive as CGI or 2D animation.  I love ""Chicken Run"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" as well as the old Claymation specials of the '80s, and while I haven't seen Laika studio's ""Coraline,"" I did enjoy their second film ""Paranorman.""  The previews I saw for ""The Boxtrolls"" made the film seem unusual, but I was willing to give it a chance, as it looked just quirky enough to be interesting.

Sadly, the biggest strength of this film is its animation.  It's marvelously detailed, but at the same time grotesque and with a curiously uninspired plot and characters.

""The Boxtrolls"" takes place in the fictional British town of Cheesebridge, in a vaguely Victorian-looking era.  The greatest threat to the city is the Boxtrolls, who are rumored to kidnap and eat human children, and Cheesebridge's mayor makes a bargain with a slimy exterminator -- if he can eliminate the Boxtrolls, he earns a place on the city council known as the White Hats.  But the Boxtrolls aren't child-eaters... and they've even adopted a young boy and have raised him as their own, naming him Eggs after the box he wears.  It isn't until Eggs has a memorable encounter with Winnie, the mayor's daughter, that he realizes he's human, and learns about the Boxtrolls' terrible reputation among humans.  He sets off on a mission to prove them wrong and to rescue fellow Boxtrolls who have been kidnapped by the exterminator... but the exterminator has a wicked plan up his sleeve, and he's not about to let a mere boy get in his way...

As stated before, this film's greatest asset is its animation and visual style.  The stop-motion animation is so smooth and meticulous that the film almost looks CGI, with very little of the jerky movements seen in most stop-motion animation.  The film has an almost steampunk feel to it, which should appeal to fans of the genre, and it isn't afraid to show the seamier, grittier side of Victorian England.  It's also nice to see variety in the faces of the characters, both human and Boxtroll, rather than every character being a generic copy.  But even this works against the movie, as some of the characters look a little TOO grotesque.  I'm not asking that all characters look aesthetically pleasing, but sometimes it feels like the grungier or more hideous characters take over the film, and gives the entire move an unappealing look.

The story itself is rather woefully generic.  ""Human child raised by another creature"" has been done nearly to death, as has ""terrifying creature is just misunderstood and must be saved from being hunted.""  While the film tries to be inventive by combining the two plots together, it doesn't do much new with either concept.  It feels like all the creative energy of this film was expended on the visuals, with little going into the plot itself.

The characters are a curiously flat bunch as well.  Eggs and Winnie are your typical plucky kids, without much to distinguish them, and the exterminator is solely defined by his obsessive quest to eliminate the Boxtrolls and earn his coveted White Hat -- we never learn why earning the position of White Hat means so much to him, nor is there anything else to his character.  Almost every character aside from the kids and trolls is a thoroughly unlikable jerk, and the trolls... they're all pretty much the same, with only a few exhibiting a single quirk to help define them.  The fact that they don't speak doesn't help much -- it's perfectly possible to create a non-verbal or nearly non-verbal character who's still likable and full of personality (look at R2D2 from ""Star Wars"" or Bumblebee from the ""Transformers"" movies), but here it just doesn't happen.

As another reviewer pointed out as well, the accents in this film are pretty thick, to the point where it can be hard to understand the characters.  I have nothing against accents in movies -- the primarily Scottish and British cast of ""Brave"" being able to speak in their native accents helped add to the charm of that movie -- but when it interferes with the ability to understand the characters, it becomes a headache.

While astounding visually, ""The Boxtrolls"" has little else to offer.  It seems that all the creativity was expended on the quirky visuals, while the story and characters were skimped on.  If you enjoyed ""Coraline"" and/or ""Paranorman,"" you'll probably be disappointed in this film, though I suppose it's worth a look if you're a die-hard animation fan.  Probably best for kids 9 and up due to violence, language, scary scenes, and some adult humor.",1430092800,,5006,4.847238542890717

I am particularly fond of them because of the complexity behind making it. I was wanting to watch this, and I am very glad that I have.

6174047,4,B00HLTDARS,"This is the third animated film from Laika Entertainment after the excellent ""Coraline"" (2009) and the lesser, but still very good, ""ParaNorman"" (2012).  Like the previous films, Laika has used stop-motion to portray their wonderful characters.

This story involves Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) who as a baby was rescued by Boxtrolls from the clutches of a band of scallywags headed by Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley).  The Boxtrolls are...well...trolls that use cardboard boxes as their clothing.  They come in different shapes and sizes but are humanoid looking with friendly, smiling faces but scary features, at least perhaps to a small child.  Snatcher has been forcing an inventor, and Eggs' human father, to build a machine capable of catching the Boxtrolls.  Evidently the subterranean creatures are feared as kidnappers at worst and unhealthy scavengers at best.

A decade passes and Eggs finds himself interacting with humans for the first time after a raid by Snatcher scatters the Boxtrolls.  The film, perhaps unwisely, changes to focus to Eggs and his human adaptation along with the interaction with a new friend, Winnie (Elle Fanning).  She is the daughter of Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris) who has employed Snatcher to rid the city of the Boxtrolls.

The film isn't terribly creative but I found it entertaining with enough ""adult"" humor to keep things interesting.  If anything I would have liked to have seen a bit more byplay involving Snatcher's henchmen voiced by Nick Frost, Tracy Morgan and Richard Ayoade.  Recommended for all ages.

The video transfer to Blu ray is really first rate.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Frankly, there is nothing to criticize regarding the look of the film.  It maintains the overall excellence of the original.  Offering beautiful colors, fine detail and is with nary a flaw.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is near perfect as well.  It provides enough information to keep the surrounds constantly in play.  It is quite immersive bringing the viewer into the dark and dusty underground with the sounds of the street swirling above.  Dialog is clear and well-focused.  Subtitles are offered in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include an audio commentary with directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi, ""Dare to be Square"" (interviews), preliminary animatic sequences and 5 short featurettes.",1429315200,,2397,5.25

The Boxtrolls (just like Paranorman) is NOT for children.  Right from the start I kept shaking my head at the inappropriate dialogue and plot and just now I paused the movie after one character is about to say a bad word (beginning with s-h) right as he's crushed by a large machine so that I could write this review.  I was originally going to not watch it after about 5 to 10 minutes in but then I found myself enjoying the Boxtrolls underground lair and the things they do etc.  At least that was cool, but nothing else is.  A cross-dressing villain with an East London accent?  SERIOUSLY, LAIKA?????  Wow, you've managed to mash together two stereotypes, now didn't you.

Coraline rocked and I'll forever love that film, but after Paranorman and Boxtrolls I will make sure that whenever I see that a film is from Laika Entertainment, I will not watch it.",1429142400,,980,4.656976744186046

The characters look and act like lumps of clay with no depth.  In the first 5 minutes of the movie, the story line is obvious for anyone that has seen a Disney movie.

6174558,2,B00HLTDARS,"The first star here is for the animation.  It was a beautiful movie.  The second star here is for the message.  Not finding our worth and value in externals, i.e., possessions, applause, 'ethnicities', genders, etc., is an important message for us all to hear.  The third, fourth, and fifth stars are missing because my four children (ages 12 through 5) thought it was ""weird,"" ""boring,"" and at best, ""interesting.""

It is really a shame that they spent so much time in stop motion animation of such beautiful puppets but dropped the ball by belaboring too many elements that were hard to grasp.  Leeches as a medical treatment? The cross-dressing villain?  Cheese as a delicacy?  Cheese as an allergy?  Hats as a symbol of elitism?  These elements were essential in creating the 'problem' in the plot, but they were so peculiar and foreign to our thinking that they ended up distracting from the beautiful messages and animation that should have been more central.

Instead of growing in tolerance of and appreciation for unfamiliar ideas, ways of living, and people from varying socio-economic divides, my family was mostly disengaged.  Thankfully, ""you make you"" was clear and our after-movie discussion was still beneficial for each of us, adults included.",1426809600,,1260,5.063106796116505

The constant dialogue about cheese with the British accents over time got on my nerves.  There a scene towards the end that's not very appropriate for small children where ""the bad guys"" tie up the main character with ropes high above the ground and lower him towards flames.  Pure act of unnecessary terrorist like violence in a children's movie.  Very surprised they took it to the next level.  Trust me, I'm not exaggerating.  I let my boys (5 and 7) watch most shows, but hindsight I probably would have opted for something else.",1426723200,,661,4.5508474576271185

6174869,2,B00HLTDARS,"This movie seemed like a heart-warming tale of a lost boy being raised by misunderstood trolls...and if you take away the ""heart-warming""...it WAS.  An effective marketing campaign and misleading movie trailers, combined with a questionable endorsement by making the Oscars' ballot, led me to believe I would quickly fall in love with these characters.

I didn't.

I love Claymation and was still left wanting by what seemed to be an attempt to duplicate the quirkiness of a Tim Burton film.  Again, it didn't.  In fact, very few of the characters were even likeable...start to finish.  So, while that may have been the filmmaker's intent, it didn't work for me...I really tried, but I just couldn't find a connection or a feeling like I had any emotion invested in the story or the characters.

Long story short...I almost bought this movie sight unseen.  I'm SO glad I didn't.  It's barely worth a rental, just so you can make up your own mind...BARELY!",1425945600,3,955,4.881987577639752

6174875,4,B00HLTDARS,"The animation is excellent. It all blends together well, with the backdrops and atmosphere. It does seem a bit slow sometimes, and I can see how a small child would loose interest quickly. It's a story to watch and listen to, but the action is limited. The Boxtrolls speak another ""troll"" language, so you can't understand what they say, and I think that alone makes it hard for a child to follow as well. You have to rely on the humans to fill in the conversational gaps. The colors for the sets and costumes are toned far down.

The characters are all done very well as far as voices and acting. The humor is limited. There are funny moments, but you have to be paying attention to get a sight gag, and the laughs are few and far between. I found the little girl to be more of an interesting multi-dimensional character than anyone else in the film.

I think older kids and adults will like it, only because it's different in its own way and style. However, it's a fair, but predictable story.",1425945600,,995,4.4021739130434785

And the problem I have is that it scared the hell out of my seven year old.  The bad guy is a monstrous demonic kidnapping man engulfed in fire and smoke (and drag?).  Not once, but at least 5-6 different times it really scared my kids.  My kids can watch the whole old Star Wars trilogy and other things like that.  They aren't babies, and they aren't sheltered, but I have to grade this down because it's about kids and seemingly for kids, but kids will probably be creeped out by it.

6175157,1,B00HLTDARS,"I managed to get through the first 20 minutes.  The animation style was unusual, but there was nothing to interest me in the story or the characters - a bunch of angry, baby-stealing monsters, an even more repulsive man hired to exterminate them, and a simpering dolt of a mayor or whoever the guy with the white hat in the big house was.

This is an example of typical Hollywood animated fare - no expense spared in production, but a disposable script.  All that was missing were a half-dozen horrible songs, but I may have stopped watching it before the first atrocity in that vein came up.  And please don't tell me ""it got better"" - if a movie doesn't make you care about the characters from the beginning, it doesn't matter how wonderful it is by the end.

6175626,5,B00HLTDARS,"This movie is now among my list of best films ever created. In case you are unaware this is a CLAYMATION film. The makers of this beautiful story made every second of this film by HAND. They sculpted all of the characters and every seamless, fluid motion you see what created by the hands of the AMAZING artists that envisioned this tale. In addition to that the actors voicing the trolls created a special language for them and I love that they chose not to dumb it down for the general public but instead gave our children some credit that they can follow and appreciate a story with limited dialog for parts of it. The animation is just so cute and beautiful and the story is about the vanity and ignorance of society and how one loud foolish person can influence the thoughts of others and what a negative impact that can have on someone who is considered ""different"". I can't wait to own this movie, my kids and I will be watching it often. It'll be extra great on our 3D TV so if you have one, you need this movie!!!",1424995200,,1022,4.328125

6175755,5,B00HLTDARS,"Delightful, funny, wildly inventive and politically astute, ""The Boxtrolls"" is like what you might have gotten if Monty Python had made a kid's stop-motion animated fable that was tremendously adult friendly. (Indeed, Eric Idle penned a very funny song for the film). It's full of good puns, bad puns, witty lines, and trenchant but not overbearing social satire about class, rich people, greed, stigmatizing of anyone 'different' and ugly mob mentality.

It was made with wonderfully original, painterly, sometimes beautiful and always playful visuals, that give it a unique look and feel.

The story is simple, a gang of Boxtrolls, odd little creatures that live in abandoned boxes the way hermit crabs take on abandoned shells, is terrorizing the small English town of Cheesebridge, where  for some odd reason - many are obsessed with cheese. The town reacts to these ugly ducklings as dangerous, but really they're more resourceful and sweet then most of the town's inhabitants, who would gladly exterminate these 'pests' without a moment's thought. The Boxtrolls are blamed for kidnapping and eating a young human boy, but really they've raised the child as one of their own, and now, as an adolescent, 'Eggs' tries to bridge the gap between the worlds.

The voice acting is all excellent, with Ben Kingsley earning special note as a terrific villain, his voice unrecognizable.

Critical reaction to this was somewhat mixed, but it all worked really well for me. A lovely blend of silly and sophisticated.",1424736000,,1510,5.146938775510204

6175758,3,B00HLTDARS,If you like this style of animation then you will probably enjoy the movie. While a cute story line it was awkward at points and perhaps it is because I am only a mild lover of cheeses and not one that would kill for cheese - I genuinely found it lacked the sticking power to hold the attention of the group of elementary school aged children I was hoping to entertain. Ah well - it's not a complete waste of time.,1424736000,,414,4.1234567901234565

6175763,3,B00HLTDARS,"It's clear that a lot of creative energy went into designing the sets and the characters, and to make this one of the most stylish and visually striking animated movies of all times. But, unfortunately, not enough energy and thought was put into the story. It looks like the creative team was so caught up with coming up with grotesque characters for their  gifted set designers to make, they forgot to think  who is the audience for this movie. The story line is bizarre, and frankly, a little scary for young children. The bad guys are vey VERY evil, but the good guys are not so likeable. There are a few  comic relief , like the bad guy's assistant discussing, in  a highly educated way, philosophical issues of right and wrong as they are clearly assisting in something wrong,  but they are too sophisticated for your children to appreciate. It's clearly a movie most children will find too scary, too bizarre or too slow. Is it for grown ups? I think it's too slow and boring for them, too.",1424736000,3,996,4.5418994413407825

6175851,1,B00HLTDARS,"We rented it because we thought it would be a cute fun, family movie, but it was not at all what we expected.  Although the claymation was amazing, the storyline and humor were poorly designed and just plain gross. There were leeches completely covering a mans face, it made food allergies a joke, one of the characters said oh my god, which could easily been changed to oh my gosh, and one character slapped a man who was dressed as a woman on the butt.  It had a few parts were we were all laughing, but besides that the humor was poor.  It was disappointing that after so much work had gone into it that it was so poorly written.  I am 13 and my sister is 10 and we don't suggest this movie at all.",1424563200,6,701,4.132352941176471

6175991,4,B00HLTDARS,"I liked this, my friends didn't.
I heard about this movie after it was already out.
As others have already said, it's similar to the Holocaust because the Snatcher is trying to get rid of a race of people, or in his case, trolls. Very power-hungry.
It has its moments though, like when the trolls finally stand up for themselves. Even Pickles and Trout redeemed themselves. Even Win's father saw the light of day in the end. All the town realized the trolls weren't monsters, and that Snatcher was just a liar, wanting power.
Eggs is likeable, just like Win. I didn't see the missing father plot coming. Wonder what happened to his mother? Win and Eggs help the trolls take up for themselves, and not hide from humans anymore. Fish is my favorite, he raised Eggs, like a parent, even teaching him to eat bugs. Eggs didn't know any different.
The extras explain all about the animation, and the commentary is informative and funny. The director said they had the trolls eating cabbages originally, but bugs seemed more scary. I agree. I was curious how the troll language was developed, and it was explained it was just sounds in the throat. Wish they could've spoken more like people, but that might've changed the movie.
This isn't for very young kids, though. I could be wrong, because of the good messages. Some younger kids might find Snatcher too scary. Parents should decide.",1424476800,,1381,4.710743801652892

Overall though we didn't like it enough that we'd buy it (which, along with a scale of 1 to 10, is how we rate our kids movies).

The feature length film would have made for a much better short film.  None of the characters were annoying but they (the boxtrolls and the antagonists) tended to be on the flat side.

It was the weakest of the 5 nominated Oscar Best Animated Feature nominees.  Certainly didn't deserve the nomination over The Lego Movie (2014).",1424390400,2,446,4.815789473684211

6176373,4,B00HLTDARS,"From the twisted imagination of Laika comes another stop-motion animated film that is sure to visually astound, but is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to the story. Basically, it's about these underground-dwelling creatures that the townsfolk of Cheesebridge think are vicious monsters, thanks to a baby being taken several years before. However, things aren't quite what they seem as the Boxtrolls have a thriving society of their own and aren't quite the monsters the townspeople have been led to believe. It should go without saying that the film is visually inventive and downright impressive to watch when you consider that this was done with stop-motion animation. CORALINE, also from Laika, was one of my favorite animated films in the year it came out and THE BOXTROLLS is just as good in that respect. It also has an outstanding voice cast, although I only recognized two of them while watching. They were Ben Kingsley as Archibald Snatcher, and Jared Harris as Lord Portly-Rind. Lord Portly-Rind is the leader of Cheesebridge, and the one who authorizes Snatcher to capture and kill all of the Boxtrolls. I must say that Ben Kingsley does a very good villain, although the substance of the character isn't unlike villains I've seen in other children's films. The visual design actually reminded me a bit of the Child Catcher from CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, and the resemblance was probably intentional.

 Where I think the film falters a little is in the story which manages to tackle some deep themes, yet is completely typical and unsubtle in its approach to them. The ending was also a little more protracted than it probably needed to be. Still, there are some good things that shouldn't go over children's heads that you can talk about with them afterwards. The biggest theme is about how we shouldn't let ""things"" define who we are. The people, especially the ""White Hats,"" in Cheesebridge are all about their cheese, and initially the Boxtrolls are defined by the box that they all wear. I think the film effectively shows that we shouldn't allow material possessions, power, or the quest for either of them, to affect who we are as people. Another theme explored is that of not fearing what we don't understand, like the people in Cheesebridge fear the Boxtrolls. One thing I didn't expect, however, was how funny this would actually be. Even though this is geared towards children, there is meta-humor and winks to the audience that parents will probably enjoy as well. Overall while the story does kind of hit you over the head with its message, and is probably a little too macabre and grotesque for young children, THE BOXTROLLS is a refreshing reminder that imagination still exists in the world of animation.",1424304000,2,2733,4.887931034482759

The Boxtrolls
Studio - Universal Studios
Rating - PG

Favorite Features -
The Box Trolls are delightful, funny and charming - I love how they cared for Eggs, the ""Box Boy"" and how they learn to change ""who"" they are.
Solid messages in this movie - messages about family and what is really important in life.
Stop-motion claymation makes this movie a true delight!
Universal Studios has this to say about The Boxtrolls; ""A family event movie which introduces audiences to a new breed of family  The Boxtrolls, a community of quirky, mischievous creatures who have lovingly raised a human boy named Eggs in the amazing cavernous home they've built beneath the streets of Cheesebridge. When the towns villain, Archibald Snatcher (Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley), comes up with a plot to get rid of the Boxtrolls, Eggs decides to venture above ground, 'into the light,' where he meets and teams up with fabulously feisty Winnie. Together, they devise a daring plan to save Eggs family.""

As I mentioned, there are several strong messages in the story of The Boxtrolls; one I especially am happy to see speaks to parents/grandparents. In this movie Winnie's dad is on focused on cheese, being important and wearing a ""white hat"". He does not listen to his daughter or pay attention to her. However; there is a point in the movie where he has to choose between his hat, which has been so very important to him, and his daughter. Happily, he chooses his daughter as he realizes what and who is really important to him.
This message can really ""speak"" to parents and grandparents as it can be all too easy for us to be distracted by things such as work, friends, computers, smart phones, etc. and become people who do not pay attention to or listen to our children/grandchildren. The Boxtrolls reminds us to keep in focus who and what really matters . . . and certainly our children/grandchildren really matter!

I also appreciated the message about how we do not have to continue to live our lives as we have in the past, but we can make choices and changes to make our lives better! The Boxtrolls combines a fun story, humor, strong messages and unique characters for a movie the family will enjoy - and even learn from!",1423785600,2,2322,4.667481662591687
6176489,5,B00HLTDARS,"I watched this the first day it was out on digital release, having sadly missed it in the theatres. I had a terrible cold, but was so excited... I watched it even though I nearly passed out a few times. Needless to say, I was slightly underwhelmed, being a Laika fan that had hyped up the film in my head prior to viewing. I tottered off to bed without a word to my boyfriend, who I always force to watch these sorts of movies. He doesn't get romantic comedies, he gets digital animation, anime, stop motion, etc. I don't think that is such a rough deal, personally!

So, the next day, I thought about it and realized I hadn't felt like the story was quite as magical as Coraline or ParaNorman. I hadn't felt as close to the main characters as I had to Coraline and to Norman, or even the side characters. I decided to watch it again.

I really don't know what changed, perhaps besides me not being so ill or in a medicated stupor, but on the second viewing I was struck by all the little subtle nuances. I noticed more little details. I felt closer to the main character ""Eggs"" - and less irritated with the previously viewed-as-snotty girl character ""Winnie"". And the BoxTrolls themselves, though perhaps a touch less individually developed than the side characters in Coraline or ParaNorman, were a lot more personable to me on second viewing. They gave off that ""you don't have to even talk to be endearing"" Wall-E vibe. And I adore Wall-E!

Anyway. I was so much happier on second viewing that I rewatched the film again right then and there. And I have watched it a couple times since then, too. Just like Coraline and ParaNorman, The BoxTrolls offers an experience for children (and large, aged children!) which doesn't paint everything black and white, but instead seems to ask the viewer to consider the good, the ugly and the gray areas in life - sometimes with a serious tone, at other times with humor, but always with great wit.

Excellent children's film, and excellent film in general. As always the artistic side and the amount of work that goes into Laika's films (and of course any animation or stop-motion animation film) just leaves me in awe... as you will see in the fun little bit with the former henchmen at the end of the flick.

Hope you enjoy this one! :-)",1423699200,,2283,4.518159806295399

6176575,4,B00HLTDARS,"From the folks that brought you the delightful Coraline and ParaNorman.  Big shoes to fill.  I missed this movie at the theater and it snuck past me in is video release.  I finally purchased the Blu-ray and prepared the family for a view.  The Boxtrolls is definitely an amazing achievement in the line of stop-motion animation.  In a physical sense everything you see is real and miniature and manipulated by fearless team of animators who apply the magic one frame at a time.  Having said that, it might take you more than one view to get the full gist of the movie.  The plot is strange and slightly off-kilter (which is good) and rather bizarre.  In the cheese-infatuated Victorian town of Cheesebridge, rumors circulate, via the scaly, slimy exterminator Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) that the subterranean creatures known as Boxtrolls (small creatures clad in cardboard boxes to hide in with an affinity for snatching any object not bolted down) capture and eat small children.  This causes havoc, of course, and Snatcher, in a quest to acquire a white hat (a symbol of status in Cheesebridge) sets forth to exterminate the little creatures after they have supposedly snatched a small boy.  If Boxtrolls is anything it is inventive.  Visually stunning.  Slightly deranged.  All the things you want in an animated feature.  I loved Coraline.  I liked The Boxtrolls.  Does that make sense?  Something is missing, but not enough to where it is awful, just not completely amazing.  Still, you will enjoy it.  I did,  Laika takes their stop-motion animation seriously. Be sure to watch all the way through for a little tongue-in-cheek view of how creation works in the realm of Cheesebridge.

My youngest son left the room appalled at the scene with all the naked bottoms. Why not allow them to have underwear?  Also, I have a son with a severe dairy allergy who has gone through anaphylaxis. I can tell you that watching the villain explode was not only grotesque and perhaps frightening for someone with a true food allergy, but entirely incorrect.  Also, while overly exaggerated, having people flirt with and slap the bottom of an obvious cross dresser was totally inappropriate for children as it would have also been inappropriate even if it had not been a cross dresser.  I leave the experience of having watched the movie with awe and respect for the animation but equally have a bitter taste in my mouth for the inappropriate innuendos and plot.

6176596,5,B00HLTDARS,"Having really enjoyed CORALINE and PARANORMAN, I was ready to see this latest from Laika.  I was not disappointed.  I have been a fan of stop-motion animation since the original KING KONG (made before I was born).  For comedy I enjoy the stop-motion of WALLACE AND GROMIT, and was very happy to see some of the sets of their THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT while in London.  What Laika creates is amazing, and with the added lure of great star voices, and a wonderful story, this was not to be missed.

In this new age of 3D printing, stop-motion studios have moved to printing the faces of characters, making an unlimited range of facial expressions possible.  I wish my 3D printer could do that.

I believe that reviewers who didn't like the film just don't get that this art form is an acquired taste, and not for quick and dirty entertainment or to babysit the kids.  This film made you think - if you are open to that experience.",1423008000,,931,4.4674556213017755

1. Creative storyline (not a we've-seen-it-many-times-before) script.

3. Very time consuming and dedicated CGI, modeling, composition, motion capture, texture, shading.
4. Quirky with individuality.
5. Some moralistic teaching about kindness, understanding, sharing, etc.
Negatives:
1. The main protagonists were too formulaic-stereotypic (think ""Train Your Dragon"") which is becoming far too common in animation these past few years where male and female features elicit that autonomic response ""awww - so cute"". Bad guys ""ughhh - get away"" look.
2. Most importantly something, which I can't pinpoint, in the story or how the characters were presented did not capture/connect me emotionally or intellectually.
Neutral:

6176656,5,B00HLTDARS,"Steampunkalicious surprise: BOXTROLLS is fine art and marvelous acting, plus pretty damned important stuff our world needs to examine... masquerading as a kid's film!

Kid-appropriate for all ages. No doubt that part of this film's appeal was carefully engineered for success. But it's the visuals that kept me watching, such perfectly realized and visually delightful worlds that I watched it twice. OK, and Ben Kingsley as the prime evil entrepreneur with his trio of exceptionally thoughtful henchmen, took this film fable beyond anything I've seen animated since Tim Burton's NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. But that is definitely more for an ado-adult audience.

ALERT: You'll never look at the cheese plate at your next foodie party the same way. DO NOT PASS THE BRIE, PLEASE.

Here's my shoutout to the great actors who voice the trolls, and the creators of the Box Troll dialect, who also deserve particular praise.

We live in a world where it's now crucial that even young kids start learning how greed and social control can be used to target cultural differences,  and how the short path from that deadly combo leads to the worst things human beings do to each other. We need this movie to show kids this truth early on, because it keeps happening, and kids keep getting bombed...or strapping on bombs because this short path is really profitable for those who exploit religious and ethnic differences. It happens over and over again.

By the end of BOXTROLLS, I realized, largely through the hilarious villainy of Ben Kingsley's character, I'd also been shown in a non-preachy, incredibly funny way, just how privatization gone wild destroys local culture and local identity, until there's not much left for *the rest of us* to choose from, or call on for our protection. We see the ongoing inaction of *the rest of us* never fails to delivers all the power to...the wrongo guys.

Without getting terribly gorey and never bogging down in puritanical preachiness [like those disgusting Veggie Tales], this movie shows how and what it takes to first, villainize the innocent, and then seamlessly roll out the machinery of, well, ethnic cleansing and holocaust.

Two deeply detailed little worlds, the cheezy vintage Middle Europeanesque above, where holding on to what passes for bling and celebrity blinds everyone to what's really going on, and the hidden, night realm of the resourceful, intensely creative, Box Troll folk who repurpose rusting Victorian junk into useful machines and folkart.

I hope families will make watching this film together an annual  ritual --and after my 2nd viewing, I'm  convinced BOXTROLLS would be an important, rich addition to middleschool curriculum, as a fun but deep prequel to ANIMAL FARM.",1422662400,5,2736,5.125842696629213

Everyone in our household - including a slightly precocious 2-year-old, a sensitive 7-year-old, a ""wizened"" 10-year-old, a 35-year-old Mom who's a fan of Coraline (et al), and a 37-year-old Dad with half a degree in fine art who's now a programmer - thoroughly enjoyed it.

There are some scary, tense, and gross bits (I'm not sure I'll ever get over the animation of that tongue), so I wouldn't recommend it for under-5s who aren't easily comforted by laptime and cuddles; but you best know your child and what s/he can handle.

The set is not traditionally pretty and the characters are designed to more exaggerated in expressions and movements. The little jokes are also especially entertaining. Overall I loved the family aspect shared between the Boxtrolls and Eggs and the social issues faced by the characters.

Personally, I believe children might be scared and confused on many of the tones and scenes of this movie so I believe that this movie should have been geared towards pre-teens and older viewers.

MLK would have loved it and belly laughed throughout the showing that was populated by every age color and stripe of our citizenry. It was wonderful on every sensual level. The moral and logic were simple and made for great conversation with myself 65 years old and my grandkids. Their opinion was ""Greed leads to bad cheese""  Even if your smeller doesn't work very well and you are allergic to it. They related the rolls of cheese to the rolls of ill gotten money that people many people from all status get hung up about. Even to the point of enslaving, torturing and ignoring the ones they love most. Ian said  "" Cheese is good and everyone should have some to eat if they like it"" Naomi's insight was that 2 out of the 3 underlings of man with the ""RED HAT"" were good guys that were not real bright and had landed a job and were afraid if they lost it they wouldn't get another and struggled with what they were doing to harmless creatures. The third guy, the short one with the glasses was a mean bully and would have done his job for free. It was a great day for me to listen to the unfiltered things that come out of the mouth of babes who rarely watch videos,TV or have cable news blaring throughout their home....After having the opportunity to sit and watch such a splendid piece of visual art which I would have never, ever bothered to see if I had not been  asked to watch them because their parents had to work on a national holiday.

The animation team did an excellent job with the characters and look of the film.  The Boxtrolls themselves at first come off creepy and scary, but you learn to love them as it develops.

The voice acting team did a great job.  Ben Kingsley was solid as his character, Snatcher, and I think his character arch was written good too.  I'm still laughing at his character's alter ego in the film.  I loved Snatchers henchmen Tracy Morgan being the Voice talent for one of them,  and how they were constantly self evaluating what they were doing.

It's a good film, I don't know if I'll buy it for my collection but watching it was fun. Its amazing how much time and effort goes into making a film like this. Watch near the end of the credits for a nod to how much work they put into making them move which they did in a funny way too.",1421884800,,1032,4.356020942408377

6176766,5,B00HLTDARS,i loved it :) very good movie. it teaches that we are all humans and special people. and people fear those who are different. this movie teaches us not to judge others based on rumors and things we hear people say. i really think that is one of the good morals a movie can have in them. this movie is as good as ParaNorman and Coraline. this movie is a bit dark too but not too dark past the rated pg rating. The animation is good and weird in a surreal and spooky way.,1421712000,2,469,4.0

6176769,5,B00HLTDARS,Laika's animation continues to be the best in the game and The Boxtrolls offers another uniquely refreshing storyline and adorably grotesque characters to fall in love with. This film is both hilarious and endearing but it's also dark and not suited for most children (or total close-minded prudes). Lighten up and enjoy a great piece of cinema.,1421712000,3,345,5.0701754385964914
6176770,1,B00HLTDARS,"Terrible, TERRIBLE movie.  Unwatchable for an adult and my children (4 & 6) barely paid attention.  The boxtrolls do not speak, they have their own jibberish.....so hard to watch.",1421625600,4,179,5.137931034482759
6176771,4,B00HLTDARS,"A clever little movie, but scarier (much like Coraline).  My 4 y.o. didn't want to watch it without me.  Some moments of peril and fear, and I needed to explain some incidents.  I'd recommend this movie because it's good, and the themes of inclusion and dealing with fear are beneficial. However, I would suggest this is not a park and go movie, but one to watch with your children (or by yourself).  For parents of children with some fears of loss, I might wait a while to watch this one.  My son liked it, and referred to it later, but not sure if we'll return to view this one a lot like we do some of the less dramatic films.",1421625600,,629,4.208333333333333

6176814,1,B00HLTDARS,"Do not waste your money on this movie! Although the word ""trolls"" should have tipped me off right from the start, I had hopes this might be a cute show. But these trolls are down right hideous and do not talk the entire movie.  They even lose their boxes midway through the movie, showing off weird little butt cracks. The adult characters are scary and show very little empathy or concern toward the children and do little to reform by the end of the movie. This is the bottom of the barrel of children's entertainment.",1421452800,8,520,4.473684210526316

I can't believe the incredible amount of detail and work that must have been put into making it.  The film is not limited to children as an audience, since it does a great job of combining slapstick with more advanced humor.  Some of the villains continually ponder their motives, arguing the basis of good vs evil... with classy puns all along.  Super funny, without the hidden vulgarities that are sometimes deployed to keep the ""adults"" in the room laughing.  This film celebrates the curious, cheerful tinkerers that this world needs more of!",1420675200,2,649,4.801801801801802

6176877,5,B00HLTDARS,"Based on the novel Here Be Monsters! by Alan Snow, The Boxtrolls is the latest 3D stop motion film from Laika Entertainment, the company behind Coraline and Paranorman. It is set in the fictional Victorian town of Cheesebridge, England, where humans hide in their houses at night in fear of the titular Boxtrolls, creatures that they believe to be dangerous.

The Boxtrolls come out of their underground hiding place at night in order to scavenge through trashcans for things they can potentially use in their inventions, all while being chased relentlessly by the Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) and his stooges. The protagonist, Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who plays Bran Stark in Game of Thrones), is a young human boy named after the type of box he wears. Eggs is being raised by these creatures and, as a result, believes himself to be a Boxtroll. After he encounters a girl in the human world named Winnie (voiced by Elle Fanning), and the Snatcher captures his Boxtroll parent, Eggs goes on a journey to free the Boxtrolls and uncover his own true origin and identity.

Thankfully, The Boxtrolls is not made for kids alone. Although children can enjoy its quirky black humor and highly likable characters, the story will make you think about power, society, and their effects on people both as individuals and as a group. Its about those who live in their boxes, excluded from their society feared and degraded, yet making no attempt to earn their rightful place alongside the humans. The Boxtrolls contains a message for all to stand up, reclaim their rights, and to leave their boxes.

The writers did a great job with the main villain, the Snatcher, by making him a truly unlikeable yet multidimensional character. That said, I wouldnt be surprised if he became a favorite for some viewers. Notably, his allergy to cheese, a vital element the films plot, helps to create some truly comical scenes.

With its 19th-century English setting, The Boxtrolls: takes full advantage of great music pieces composed by Dario Marianelli, who won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for his score of Atonement. Quattro Sabatino, for instance, is still playing repeatedly in my head.

Though The Boxtrolls has not received as much promotion as Disney, Pixar, or DreamWorks films, this does not mean that its bad by any means. The 3D effects are not gimmicky at all, fortunately, but are instead a pleasing addition to the film. From its earth-toned world to its black humor, The Boxtrolls is a unique, enjoyable film. Its a dark horse for those whove had enough of princesses and fairytales and are looking for something fresh and different. If you still remember the glory days of Chicken Run or Coraline, you won't want to miss the magic of The Boxtrolls.

I think it was too much story for a 3 year old and not enough action/funny. Same for this 40 year old dad.

6177064,5,B00HLTDARS,"It's a beautiful film to watch and my favorite from LAIKA.  They have clearly mastered stop-motion cinematography, just watch the hair blowing or the background of every scene, simply stunning.

I don't want to give too much away,  as the story was much more fun to watch going in blinded.  Fish and the other trolls will steal your heart.  But be aware, the villain (Snatcher) is a TRUE bad guy with a awful cheese allergy.  My three year old had no problems watching the film,  but she is already familiar with Coraline and Paranorman, where the stories are darker than the Boxtrolls.

Do yourself a favor and watch it.  If not for the story but for the artistry.  Keep in mind for every minute of footage,  it was one week of work for the animators.  And it's obvious the care and love that they put into it.  Watch it on repeat- you'll always catch new details you may have missed the first few times.",1420070400,,905,4.445121951219512

The Boxtrolls don't talk, and I personally don't care for movies with too much silence.  I'm sure it is very hard to make stop motion animation but honestly I thought the people in the movie were ugly - to the point that it bothered me.  It was unpleasing to the eye and I thought they had hard to understand accents.  I don't care for the story which simply is - kill all the boxtrolls.  The stop motion animation is nowhere near as good as Coraline and Paranorman, so it is not even worth seeing just for the graphics.  You can see all the best of the animation in the trailer.  No good music in the film either.  It is overall just WEIRD.

Also, the closed captions are ahead of the movie as noted.  I reported the problem as someone suggested below and it's been 5 days now.  Amazon called me today to tell me there was no update on the ticket so I got a refund.

This is a fantastic family film with enough plot twists to make it interesting and -- surprising to me -- not predictable! For those who enjoyed the Wallace & Grommet style of animation (computer assisted claymation), the motions are smooth, the style is unique, and the dialog is enjoyable. It is a little intense in places, but great for eyes 10 and older. You will be pleasantly surprised.",1419811200,,558,4.534653465346534

6177240,4,B00HLTDARS,"As other people have mentioned, the closed captions are out of sync - they are ahead by about 2 minutes.  For this reason, I would wait a few days to RENT this so Amazon can fix this problem.  If you call customer service, the agents won't understand the problem and they will waste your time with troubleshooting that doesn't work (I've called twice now).  You have to get them to write a ""ticket"" so the problem can be turned in to the technical engineers.  Any employee below the technical engineer level will waste your time.  these statements are based on my personal experience with the 2 phone calls, not a general statement.

I've turned in a ticket - I'm personally using a Roku.  Amazon said it would take 1-2 days to fix.  But, the amazon customer service rep told me that I am the only person experiencing this issue - which is clearly NOT true.  So please people, call it in and turn in tickets if you can.  I don't know about you, but I wanted to watch this movie with my daughter this weekend, but I need the closed captions.

In terms of the movie - I liked it and enjoyed watching it.  The story is simple but classic.  I don't like that the box troll characters hardly talk at all.  This is just my personal preference, I have seen several cartoon/animated movies where the characters can't or don't talk much and I just don't like that.  The beginning of the movie is slow as it focuses mostly on setting the scene and the 3D stop-motion animation.  The 3D stop-motion animation is stunning - meticulously detailed, beautiful, and just overall awesome.  I would watch the movie for this reason alone.

I think it is a good movie to purchase.  Of course the error with the closed captions is NOT acceptable, and calling customer service is always a pain.  However, you might be able to get a refund if you have already rented it.",1419638400,4,1847,4.473053892215569

To put it nicely it was gross, ok it was absolutely disgusting. My husband and I were both repulsed. Also WAY too much screen time was waisted on the villian. I yearned for more time in the secret boxtroll world but that was quickly breezed through in montage form. Nope, I have no desire to see this again and have discouraged friends from wasting their time on seeing it once. It certainly is not one to own in disc unless you worked on the film and want to see your handiwork.",1419206400,7,620,4.3076923076923075
6177317,4,B00HLTDARS,"Earlier this year, I saw one of the most magical teaser trailers Id ever seen in all my years of movie watching.  It was for the most recent contribution to Claymation cinema, The Boxtrolls.  I knew instantly that I wanted to see this movie.  The trailer carried this spark of magic, intrigue and most surprisingly, grace, and I just had to have it in my life.  I don't know if Ive watched a single trailer more than that one.  Nothing but music and images of splendor.  Then the official trailer was released, the one with the plot explained and the characters talking, and I thought to myself, Why cant the movie be silent images set to music?

It seemed so much more interesting that way.

When sitting down to watch this film the other night, I was instantly transported to that teaser trailer (after the abruptly jarring opening sequence) when the film takes on a beautifully composed montage of young Eggs (the boy) growing up with the Boxtrolls, in particular one named Fish, who was his father figure.  The scene isn't very long, a few minutes, but it is entirely set to music (David Marianellis score is triumphant) and has so much life and character that I felt myself drawn in deeper to this world.

Then the talking started again.

I don't often say this, but I really wish that this film had been silent.  Lets break it down to the core, show only the most compelling moments, tear out all the unnecessary dialog and just play that stunning score over what we have left.  It isn't that The Boxtrolls is a bad film or that the story and plot and dialog is awful or anything, but it is so far beneath the visual and aural accomplishments that I really wish the film had been stripped of all the elements that, in my eyes, detract from what this could have been.  With a more simplistic, minimalist approach, this could have been utter magic.

Instead, we have a cute, albeit pointless (and plot hole ridden) tale of family of the oddest shape and size.

The Boxtrolls tells the tale of a village plagued by the thought of monsters lurking beneath their streets, snatching babies and eating them and piles of bones reaching the ceilings.  Those stories are fabricated, as the Boxtrolls themselves are rather simple, timid creatures.  They were fabricated by a disgusting man named Archibald Snatcher who is determined to be considered upper crust.  In fact, he desires to belong to this prestige White Hat Society where he can sit in a room and eat cheese, despite his obvious lactose-intolerance.  So, he strikes a deal that if he rids the town of these grotesque (so he says) creatures then he can attain a coveted white hat.  So, for years he and his henchmen (who consider themselves the good guys) have been terrorizing these poor creatures, snatching them from their boxes and their homes.  Eggs, a young boy who has been living with the Boxtrolls, is disillusioned when Fish is trollnapped, and so he becomes determined to find and free him.  This is when he comes into contact with a precocious little girl named Winnie who wants to know more about these Boxtrolls and the legend of the little boy they apparently kidnapped.

There are themes here that are touched upon and bring a potential to the table and something richer, but that never really flourish.  The idea of fatherhood and what it means to be a father (listening, protecting, helping) are mentioned and apparently expounded on, but it never really feels richly exposed and discussed.  Instead, it feels kind of thrown there to make a point.  I blame the absurdity of much of the plot and the holes in the plots progression for this.  The idea that all of this is done over a simple hat, prestige that isn't really all that well regarded, is silly, and the points never touched on (how in the world can Eggs talk like a human?) leave me wondering why such little thought was given to making this film work as a whole.

Still, it is visually appealing, and there are moments that really sing.  The opening scene I touched upon earlier, and the dance scene at the ball are all stunning segments that really breathe such life into the film, but overall the film feels slight.  It is a very brisk movie, feeling even shorter than its 96 minutes, thanks to a lack of real depth of plot.  Despite the visual beauty, and that stunning score, I walked out of the theater feeling like I hadnt seen much of anything at all.",1418169600,2,4394,4.600770218228498
