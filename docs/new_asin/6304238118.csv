The commentary by the director , screenwriter, and producer is a real treat to liten to; you can feel their passion for film making and rock and roll.  Most humorous is how they convinced Roger Corman to change the film from  DISCO HIGH to ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL.  Just a fun, fun movie.  The DVD  presentation is wonderful, though there are a few scratches from the  transfer (What do you expect?  It's Roger Corman!).  And the audio outtakes  are a must for Ramones fans.  And with Clint Howard, Paul Bartel, and Dick  Miller in the same movie, how can you go wrong?",917308800,11,637,4.396551724137931

It felt like we were watching a Ramones concert with a huge audience. Everyone applauded when the Ramones first appeared on screen and then applauded and cheered again every time they played a song!

The Blu-ray itself is packed with extras and very good print of the movie. I was surprised to learn that producer, Roger Corman, originally wanted to call the movie ""Disco High"" and have an all disco soundtrack!

812974,5,6304238118,"The essence of a bad ""B"" movie. The acting is ham-fisted, the script tracing paper thin, the lighting shiny and bright.
But if you want to distill the essence of punk's DIY chunky, clunky ham-fisted realm and reality, the 3-chord, a furnace blast and a whiff of glue, this isn't a bad place to start.
An homage to the Ramones, New York punk's Dead End Kids, PJ Soles as Riff Randall spends most of the movie perkily espousing her obsession with the four black leather jacketed musicians. Vince Van Patten as the dorky golden boy football star who can't score with the girls is especially hilarious in his cardboard acting.
One of those the worse, the better propositions: ""Rock & Roll High School"" is definitive! And it all culminates with the Ramones taking over the school... But oh the turns, the troubles, the blockades and the attempts to stifle Randall's euphoria over her most ever favorite band in the world.",1418083200,,916,4.73125

It quickly got picked up in the east and internationally. The Band got their recognition they wanted and let john mcbride into a Hollywood writer. The pyrotechnic almost went disastrous when the singed faced operator over loaded the troughs of powder at 3am in the morning sending the flames to tripple in size. Production only paid $1000 for the rent of this abandoned catholic school and never told of the fireworks at the end of the movie.

813096,4,6304238118,"Remember when things were fun, exciting, colorful, pop culturally significant and impactful? This movie is a rockin' product of it's time, and I can't believe it has taken me this long to properly see the movie.

The movie takes place in 1980, although it came out in 1979, and it's central location is Vince Lombardi High School. At first, it seems like a typical high school. Riff Randall (the adorable P.J. Soles) is the rock and roll loving rebel of the school. However, things soon change with the arrival of the new principal, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov), who finds the school, it's students, and, worst of all, the love of rock and roll music to be appalling, and The Ramones are the worst of the worst. What happens next is rock and roll/comedy/high school anarchy as the students fight back against the school's iron fisted new ruler, with help from the Ramones along the way.

This movie is pure 70s, B-movie gold. One of the best things, if not the best, to come from the Roger Corman B-movie factory. As much as it's a fun, rollicking high school comedy, it's also a fun piece of history capturing The Ramones. The music is great. It's loud, catchy, funky, rebellious and just a whole lot of fun. When was the last time you could say that about music? The same words you could also use to describe this movie. Filled with likable characters and actors, the movie wants nothing more to entertain you and have fun. Some of the comedy and goings on in the school border on some things that are pretty far out, but who cares? Isn't that always part of the fun that entertainment can give you? Director Allan Arkush (with rummors of help from Joe Dante), piles on the fun in an 'anything goes' way and whips you into a frenzy before the ending, quite literally, blows the roof off. The screenplay is fast and loose and it's only message is one that has been universal for a long time - the rebellious kids and their rock and roll against the square adults who just don't get it.

Peppered with familiar faces, P.J. Soles, Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard and Paul Bartel, the movie is literally a smorgasboard of ""Hey, remember them!?"". The acting may not all be great with every cast member, but they give it their all just in the sheer excitement of youthfulness and fun.

Coming equipped with a nice set of bonus features, including a couple interview featurettes (the one with the three cast members was like catching up with high school friends), this is the edition to get. Everyone, going by the interviews and the notes that come in the booklet, seems to of had a good time making the movie and have nothing but the fondest memories of it. You will too after seeing it. It's silly, it's funny, it rocks and is a perfect slice of nostalgia that represents a type of movie and filmmaking that is sorely missed. Rock on!",1397779200,,2857,4.552529182879377
813097,2,6304238118,"The non-Ramones passages of the ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL are dumb, but, unlike, say, the NAKED GUN movies or television's SON OF THE BEACH, dumb without wit.  This is in spite of the fine actress P.J. Soles starring in this 1979 musical-comedy film.  But if nothing else, see the movie just to fast-forward to the scenes with the Ramones, who do not embarrass themselves because they keep any attempts at upstaging Soles and the other real actors in check and, more importantly, treat us to a number of their great songs, some of it live, some lip-sync.  Frankly, I'm happy I saw ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL just to see Dee Dee exclaim, ""Pizza!""

Damn shame, as I write this it's been 35 years since ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL and how long ago did we lose Joey, Dee Dee, and Johnny?  For a double feature of joy and sadness, view ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL and the 2001 Ramones documentary HEY, HO, LET'S GO: THE STORY OF THE RAMONES.",1394755200,,931,4.421052631578948

Still, that's not quite enough to salvage this Roger Corman vehicle. Bad acting, lame script, cliched plot and forced laughs are what we see here. Somehow, this has acquired cult status. And there are a suitcase full of extras with many of the cast and crew congratulating themselves on having made it. In reality, this story had been done better before, and much much better since this came out in 1980. Three of the four Ramones are now gone, and this was their only film appearance, aside from documentaries. So, if you liked them - and I did not especially - then watch this for the music history. They were really weird people to look at. Maybe it's better if you're stoned, too.",1316131200,2,802,4.537931034482758

813396,4,6304238118,"This definitely falls under the category of ""they don't make movies like this anymore"".  Rock and Roll High School is a fun romp about P.J. Soles and her obsession with going to see her favorite band, The Ramones, and getting them to record a song she wrote especially for them.  Standing in her way is Corman favorite Mary Woronov, as a dictator-like principal who hates rock and roll...especially The Ramones.  Kinda like a Corman version of Footloose if you will.  On our journey to the night of the show, we're treated to a bunch of high school shenanigans, romances and a few musical numbers.  Once at the show we get a good amount of Ramones time.  Then, The Ramones end up at the high school and all hell breaks loose!
It's a very fun and lighthearted film.  Definitely not on a Porky's level of raunchiness or anything, it's relatively safe for everyone(a great way to introduce small children to REAL rock and roll....what a concept!).  You don't have to be a Ramones fan, but it does help as they get a bunch of screen time in the latter half.  Hell, it may even make you a fan.
Shout Factory has done a good job with extras, so you can scrap that DVD copy from the late 90s now.  There's a good restrospective documentary that includes most of those involved, along with Marky Ramone.  There's also another segment with that goofball, Leonard Maltin(who's always seemed clueless when it comes to cult films) interviewing Roger Corman.  There's a few other goodies that escape my memory at the moment as well.
Another victory for Shout Factory!

813398,5,6304238118,"I've always liked the Ramones. Their delightful songs are short, fast and loud. Ultra-high energy stuff. Fun music. But, I've only listened to their recordings and have never even seen a video of them. Such is life. In any case, my attention was called to a new video version (2010) of ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" and I had to have it. My wife and I viewed it the other night. I might add that she was somewhat reluctant in that she regarded the Ramones as a bunch of hooligans not worthy of serious watching or listening.

Well, we viewed it and it was a junk B movie, but it was very enjoyable junk. Delightful! Even my wife liked it. The story line was utterly improbable, the acting was bad and the scenes were ludicrous, yet, somehow, it all worked and ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" was one of the more enjoyable movies I've watched in years. In it's own inimitatble way it was very funny. After listening to the Ramones for all these years, it was great fun seeing them in action. Without them, the movie would have been simply a very bad movie.

I know, I know, this is not an art film and it does not deserve high cinematic praise. But it's very enjoyable and it was great fun watching. My wife and I have been talking about it for several days now, and how often do you do that after watching a movie? This DVD will be worth viewing again and again. It's a classic! Relax and have a few good laughs as you enjoy the music, especially if you're a Ramones fan.

Added Note of 7/26/11: I've now watched this film (DVD) three times. It just gets better and better. Last night I was in a down mood and needed something to brighten my spirits. Well, this did it! I laughed so hard in places that I was crying. Wonderful! Indeed a classic!

813400,5,6304238118,"This film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish. The Ramones, reigning princes of late-70s Punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars as Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin', and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics.

Meanwhile the school that Riff attends, has just hired a brand-new Principal, named Ms. Togar. She's a tall, intimidating Amazon of a woman. And she vows to make the students 'toe-the-line'. She even has a couple of the students act as monitors, who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. Ms. Togar is especially determined to nab Riff, and put a stop to Riff's anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn.

Kudos to the superb performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. Togar, with sneering relish. PJ Soles as Riff, turns in an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as the duplicitous Eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role.

The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential, in the 70s Punk rock scene. Certainly, this is a good film for Ramones fans. But even if you're not into the Ramones, or Punk rock, this movie is a terrific blast (literally) of energetic fun.",1261958400,4,1498,4.666666666666667

Miss Togar (Mary Woronov from Death Race 2000, Silent Night Bloody Night, Night Of The Comet, etc.) would have fit right in w/ her Hitler / Stalin routine. Riff (P.J. Soles from Carrie and Halloween) represents the kids who went against the deadening system and dared to be individuals. She just wants to have fun (while she's young!) by flushing the rules. The Ramones were the original punks, far ahead of the pack. They were doing their brand of music long before any of the ""punk movement"" even started. ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is an excellent showcase for them, featuring some priceless concert scenes, as well as tons of good, old fashioned, dumb comedy.

There are fewer things worse than bad comedy, and that's what this film is.  Just because something is meant to be cheesy doesn't automatically make it entertaining.  Many of the jokes in this film fall flat, and I just couldn't get into it.  I kept wanting The Ramones to come back on and do some songs.

813529,5,6304238118,"With exploding mice, body searching hall monitors, ear mail receiving music teachers seeking glue to sniff, parents that may not know that their own children are Ramones, and a high school principal who has no problem putting demerits into student records for life, ""Rock 'N Roll High School"" is the ultimate cheesy and campy movie ever made.  The 1970's cheese is on par, if not even more stale, than its sister movie: ""Death Race 2000"".  The jokes fall flat, horribly flat.  One can easily accuse ""Rock 'N Roll High School"" as being the D.U.M.B.est movie ever produced.

I may older now, but I am not embarrassed to watch it.  Why?  Because the Ramonies (sic) give this movie its explosive chemistry that even nuclear physicist Kate Rambo can't produce in a beaker.

Historical sidenote: Cheap Trick was originally approached to be in the movie, but turned it down.  Cheap Trick probably would have been better actors, but without the Ramones, the movie would not have had the same charm.  In fact, some of the best moments in the film are when the Ramones  attempt their single lines.  Who can't laugh, and rewind, when Joey Ramone calls music teacher Mr. McGree, ""Mr. McGlueber""?

Recently, a few friends and I were talking about this movie and I mentioned that I had it.  Well, I don't know which makes me feel more mortal -- the fact that my VCR player no longer functions or the fact that Tommy Ramone is the only original surviving member of the Ramones. Tommy Ramone's hair has gone from black, to grey, to white.

Conclusion: Life is jokingly short, make the most out of it.

My ex cried when Joey Ramone died from cancer.  I admit that my eyes started to steam up as well, but then I knew that Joey wouldn't want people crying.  I took a beer out of the fridge and paid my respect.  I feel most fortunate for the few times that I, and her, were able to see the Ramones in concert.

The Ramones believed in miracles.  They believed in a better world, for me and you.
(These are lyrics, if you aren't familiar.)

The world needs to believe in them.  If we have the guts and will to survive, we need to pass the Ramones down to the next generation to keep rock 'n roll music alive.",1217289600,9,2189,4.50253807106599
813530,4,6304238118,"Take the serious cinema from the 1950s, which focused on teenage angst, merge it with punk rock and bring The Ramones into the mix as honorary students at a high school and it creates this timeless rave-up of the generational divide caused by rock-n-roll.

The over-the-top acting and a script that doesn't take itself too seriously is the winning combination.

The iron-fisted principal, two students who are snitches for the administration, out-of-touch parents and tough-talking police ultimately face a student body unified by music; through a teen talented in songwriting - who is thrust into a position of leadership - one ""cool"" teacher and a band looking to blow the roof off every night club (or school) with its high-octane, three-chord songs.

The casting of The Ramones was masterful, as their music harkens back to the early days of rock-n-roll, but with a punk credo they created in the 1970s through legendary gigs in New York City clubs.

The bonus features - including outtakes, commentary by producer Roger Corman & director Allan Arkush, along with the original theatrical trailer & radio ads - sends this set to the head of the class.",1205798400,3,1154,4.994791666666667

Clint Howard (brother of Ron Howard) is hilarious in it.

Old school punk rockers will see some of the Germs in the movie.

The actual high school is El Segundo and the live music at the Roxy in LA.

As far as rock films go, this one works, the Ramones goofing on themselves. It does have some drug scenes in it that are somewhat innocent (Riff getting stoned and the Ramones serenading to her in her bedroom is hilarious) But it's intentionally D-U-M-B.

This exposed The Ramones to a mainstream audience that either got it or didn't, and the songs in the film weren't any of the dark ones like ""53rd and 3rd"".

This was shown on cable countless times in the early 80s, I think this is the third repackage, but it's got a lot of stuff in it, unfortunately only one of the Ramones contributed, as 3 of them have passed away, and they broke up in '96 under less than great circumstances.

Did I mention the Ramones are in it? Aside from delivering a mind-blowingly excellent concert sequence, the boys show off their acting chops (Johnny's complete inability to emote is as hilarious as anything that was actually written into the script, while Dee Dee merely wanders through the film in a bemused, drugged-out haze) in their first and only major onscreen roles. It's a joy to watch even for non-fans- behind all the hype about the band, there's a B-grade high school comedy that's far, far more entertaining than it has any right to be, and it's here that the real fun starts.

Centering around the exploits of teenage punkette Riff Randell (that would be P.J. Soles.) & her war against the school administration (Mary Woronov and a disturbing pair of false eyebrows), R&RHS is the kind of goofy good time that you just don't find at the movies nowadays. You will laugh till fluids come out of your nose. I guarantee it. Plus there's the added bonus of seeing the high school get bombed into oblivion at the end (who hasn't dreamed of that?).

813670,5,6304238118,"Rock and Roll High School has suffered from poor video releases since the 1980s.  There have been at least two DVD releases, both of which used the same transfer as the laserdisc.  The picture was not anamorphic widescreen and the showed all the flaws of the late 70s film stock that was used for this picture.

The Blu-Ray release corrects all these problems.  The colors are bold, vivid, and crisp.  The sound is still in the original mono (probably the best decision, given the source) but it's clean.  There's a lot of detail that I didn't notice before, and I've seen this dozens of times.  This film has never looked so good.

And I'm happy to report that the line of dialogue which was missing from the laserdisc and DVD releases has at long last been restored.

Everything just fell in place perfectly.  Director Allan Arkush captures the anarchic energy of rock.  The film's manic comic stylings remind me alot of the work done by Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker that came later.  He had the perfect lead in P.J. Soles who throws herself wholeheartedly into the part of Riff Randall.  Her spirited performance is downright infectuous.  And how about them Ramones?  The Ramones were at the time of this film essentially a cult band but within the context of this film they are akin to the Rolling Stones in the rock pantheon.  The producers were also fortunate that the Ramones at this stage in their career had just delivered their artistic masterpiece, ""Rocket to Russia"".  This film could possibly have worked without the Ramones but their prescence here raises the film to classic status.  Their performances here are first-rate whether they are lip-synced or live.

She actually makes us believe that her character has a crush on Joey Ramone, who definitely does *not* fit the stereotype of a good-looking teen idol.

This DVD edition is a bit disappointing. First, the audio mastering isn't up to snuff. There are several spots when the sound is clipped or distorted, usually when there is a loud and sudden noise. Those problems weren't in the VHS version that I saw. Second, you can sometimes see scratches on the image, which is really lame for a DVD.

Forget about Britney Spears and Mandy Moore's brand of bubblegum pop music and their equally bland movies - they don't hold a candle to the unbridled power of those punk rockers from New York City, the Ramones!

From B-movie veterans like Paul (Eating Raoul) Bartel and Mary (Death Race 2000) Woronov to newcomers (at the time), P.J. (Halloween) Soles and Dey (Strange Invaders) Young, the entire cast has a lot of fun spouting the film's wonderfully inspired cornball dialogue (""If you don't like it, you can put it where the monkey puts the nuts.""). The Ramones are good sports and mumble their way through the film and truly coming alive during the music sequences. The movie rightfully cements their reputation as legends.

Rock 'n' Roll High School embodies the essence of the punk rock music that made the Ramones famous. The film is bursting with youthful energy, a dose of good ol' fashion anarchy and is loads of fun to watch. These are also the ingredients that made Rock 'n' Roll High School a cult film. It was a commercial and critical failure upon its initial release but repeated midnight screenings, coupled with steady appearances on TV, have helped the film endure over the years.

New to this edition is a ""Back to School: A Retrospective"" that takes a look back at this cult film with new interviews with producer Roger Corman, Alan Arkush and cast members Clint Howard, Dey Young, Mary Woronov and Loren Lester and the surviving Ramone from that time, Marky. This is an affectionate, fun look at this movie with everyone reminiscing fondly about their experiences.

Producer Michael Finnell, screenwriter Richard Whitley and director Alan Arkush deliver an engaging and rather chatty audio commentary. The three men laugh and joke about working on Rock 'n' Roll High School. They clearly have fond memories of their experiences on the movie.

Another new addition is an audio commentary by Corman and Young. She admits that in reality she was more like Riff Randell than her character. There are several lulls but it is nice to hear these two reminisce about their experiences on the movie.

Also included is a dynamic theatrical trailer that gives away the ending! Definitely watch this last if you haven't seen the movie.

Gone is the Leonard Maltin interview with Roger Corman.

A real treat for fans of the Ramones are several audio outtakes during the filming of the concert sequence. These are the original audio tracks of the band in action.

While Rock 'n' Roll High School will appeal predominantly to fans of the Ramones (duh!), it is also one of those fun, goofy movies to invite friends over and watch with copious amounts of junk food on hand.

There are a few clever jokes in the movie (like naming the school Vince Lombardi High) but it's pretty much an hour and a half long music video. You're better off just buying any Ramones album because the sound quality during their movie concert is pretty bad.

The scenes with the Ramones are great too, the band themselves don't have a lot of lines (the included booklet talks about how uncomfortable they were with the acting portion, so it's probably for the best), but the live scenes are well directed, and the plot bits they do take part in are fabulous.
I enjoyed the commentary track a lot too, the movie was shot in less than three weeks on the smallest budget possible, so there's obviously a lot of fun stories on how they managed to put everything together on such tight constraints, and still have a great time doing it.
Rock'n Roll High School is by no means the greatest movie ever made or anything of that class, but that doesn't take away from the fact that its just plain fun to watch, and re-watch. Get it and have some fun.",1076371200,,1115,4.58

813938,4,6304238118,"I originally had this on VHS from some used video store collection around 1992; I was so scared it would break that I bought two copies. Thank heavens it's on DVD! ""Rock And Roll High School"" was a giddy over-the-top b-movie from the king of the b's, Roger Corman. I am sure it was patterned after the teen rebellion movies of the 50's and the anarchy of The Beatles' films, but probably with less of a budget than The Ramones spent on their albums.
It's that cheesy low budget quality permeates this movie and gives it charm. The jokes are often beyond silly (the exploding rat, for instance) and the acting just above cornball caricature. It makes me love it all the more. The soundtrack has all the standard when-teens-attack songs like ""School's Out"" and The Ramones' brilliant title song. Then for added musical pleasure measure, there's a never released Paul McCartney song and inclusions from Nick Lowe and Eddie & the Hot Rods.
There are so many classic moments here, from Dee Dee playing in the shower, Mr. McCree's (Paul Bartel) transformation to a punker in the hallways, the EEEE-Vul Miss Togar, the ""office"" of Eaglebauer, and of course, the wish fulfillment fantasy as The Ramones and the students do what every student who ever hated High School and loved Rock and Roll would want: take over Vince Lombardi High. (And let's not forget the fantastic Ramones concert sequence!) ""Rock And Roll High School"" may not be the best Rock driven movie of all time, but I'd probably call it my personal favorite. It's Gabba Gabba Groovy.",1048291200,3,1541,4.753731343283582

Oh, and the Ramones kinda save the day. This movie rules. The music's great, the energy's high, and the characters are all perfect confectionous, high colored paintings. All this comes together into the perfect crowd-pleaser film.
Some highlights:
""We're not students, we're Ramones.""
  -Joey Ramone (does not move mouth)

Vince Lombardi is an amazing school because not only does the whole student body break into song and dance when hearing the Ramones, but it actually beckons the Ramones to come and rock the roof off, literally. But the catch is the evil, oppressive new principal- a Ramones/Rock n Roll hater.
Then The Ramones concert his their town and Riff camps out for 3 days to be first in line, leading up to a cool concert and The Ramones bombarding her high school and overthrowing all authority.
Not exactly Oscar-worthy, but it doesn't have to be. The Ramones are somehow brilliant and lovable even when eating pizza.

I got to see The Ramones live in Boston, six years ago, and they were just as good then as they were in their concert that was filmed for this movie, whic was made in the late 70's.
I recently watched this again on AMC's American POP(basic cable), and just felt sad.  All I could think of is how Joey is dead now, and there is no more band, it just wouldn't be the same without him.  I consider this to be a tribute to him now.
That said and done, this is a Roger Corman film, he was a b-movie director so this movie certainly isn't a great movie persay.  it is the mix of the enthusiasm of the actors, particularly, P.J. Soles, and the great music of the Ramones that make this film worth watching. It's a harmless fun little movie about teenage rebellion all built around the music of Joey and his brothers.

814089,5,6304238118,"Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock and Roll High School.
That's how the song begins for one of the best Ramones songs and surely the most unique event in their history, a starring role in a feature film! I love movies with rock bands. A Hard Days Night, Head, and this film are probably my all time favorite ""Band"" films. When I was in high school and college, we had a ritual of going to see the midnight movies on most weekends. Usually they featured such ""gems"" as H.O.T.S. and Flesh Gordan, but occasionally you would come across a real sleeper. In 1979 I walked into Eastland mall to see a film I had never heard of and walked out a Ramones fan forever. It was still early in this films release, but it had already skipped most of the big theatres and gone straight to midnight showings. I guess a movie about a punk band (actually a straight up rock band) and a bunch 0f kids who blow up their school was never going to cross the 100 million mark. Made with virtually no budget and featuring PJ Soles, Clint Howard and Vincent Van Patten, along with the Ramones this movie is funny, has great tunes (Rundgren, McCartney, Alice Cooper etc), cute girls, and features a great scene where they blow the school up while the Ramones play the theme.
This movie came out right after PJ Soles had made her screen debut in Halloween and just before she played Bill Murrays girlfriend in Stripes. She was perfect for the role of the Ramones fanatic and she can sing too. She does a great version of Rock and Roll High School, upstaging the preppy cheerleaders in the gym. Clint Howard (Rons brother) actually has something to do in this film. He plays the school ""dealer"". Not in drugs mind you, he is the guys that sells you hall passes and gets you the makeout van for your hot dates. A very different role from all his walkon roles in Ron Howard films. The rest of the cast is well chosen and we even have a great villain in the evil principal Miss Togar. Someone you love to hate. Don't worry, she gets hers. This is just a great cult movie.
It was followed with a sequel, minus the Ramones and starring Corey Feldman. I don't think anyone ever saw that one. What was the point?
Highly recommended if you love rock band films. Get it while you can, it was out of print and was brought back after Joey died. It most likely will go out of print again.",999820800,9,2342,4.337129840546697

Having said that, it's a treat that this part of his legacy is finally available again for all to treasure.  Sort of a twisted mix of low-budget 1950's juvenile delinquent movies and 1960's beach comedies, ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" has aged surprising well, thanks in most part I guess to the timeless appeal of the ""brothers"" Ramone.  Highlights, besides the hopped up concert footage (filmed in front of an enthusiastic audience), include the Ramones pulling up to a concert venue in an old Cadillac singing ""I Just Want To Have Something To Do,"" a fantasy sequence in which self-proclaimed #1 Ramones fan Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) imagines the band serenading her in her bedroom, complete with Dee Dee and his bass under a running shower, and the final scene in which The Ramones play the title track while the high school explodes behind them in a piece of perfectly staged incendiary directing by Allan Arkush.
