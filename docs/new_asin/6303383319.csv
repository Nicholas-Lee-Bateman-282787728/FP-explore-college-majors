635185,2,6303383319,"Julia Sweeny, Dave Foley, Charles Rocket, Kathy Griffin and Tim Meadows. A great cast! But I was disapointed to be truthful. I love SNL movies, but this was probably the worst. Pat was funny...in some parts. But the hour  and eighteen minutes that this movie last...it lags on. They could of made  this a thirty minute short TV thing. I was disapointed to see Dave Foley in  drag...again. I was glad to see Tim Meadows with a small role, he needs to  get off of SNL and move on with his career or just find something else to  do. Kathy Griffin was horrible, I just wanted her to go away. All in all,  it was the stupidest movie I ever saw...but it was still pretty funny.  Here's an example of SNL skits that shouldn't become movies...wink wink,  nudge, nudge...night at the Roxbury?",941846400,,783,4.464788732394366
635186,3,6303383319,"""It's Pat...the Movie"" was really enjoyable. We got a lot of laughs out of it.  Maybe what makes it so funny is that almost everyone has seen or has known an androgynous character like Pat. If you take the movie  at face value and try not to analyze it, you'll find Kyle's obsession with  learning Pat's gender extremely comical.  Rent it!",934848000,5,339,4.508196721311475

635188,5,6303383319,"This was just a hilarious movie.  It had many, many funny moments, but was too short.  Dave Foley was hilarious as Chris, much funnier than Dana Carvey, who portrayed Chris on the series.  Rent it, or better yet, buy it,  from amazon.com!",915321600,2,238,4.595238095238095

635369,5,6303383319,"People love it or hate it, there just does not exist middle ground for this flick. It is worth the time to watch it to find out. My siblings and I were exposed to this movie when it first came out in the early nineties and we found it hilarious. I am unable to turn back the hands of time in order to wait until my personality was developed more to see if I would have reacted the same as an adult, but it has gone down as a classic for us and I am glad it did. To this day we have one-line inside jokes from this movie that never fail to draw outbursts of laughter and nostalgia like no other movie can. ""You know what I hate? Senseless evil."" ""Me too!"" I suspect that everyone whom hates senseless evil will fall in love with this movie. A classic. I just today (over twenty years after seeing this movie) ordered an ""It's Pat!"" tee-shirt and had it sent to my younger sister's house anonymously as a gift. I relish the thought of her excitedly receiving this box having no idea what could be inside , opening it eagerly to find a large portrait of Pat smiling on the front. She will instantly know whom it is from. I love you Amanda! .",1450828800,,1138,4.1076233183856505

635457,3,6303383319,"Beating a dead horse usually doesn't go to far. This is a very long skit of the SNL character Pat. The short skit format is a homerun for this type of character, but the movie can only ride a limited theme so far. A few jokes hit home but it got a little tiring . Still it's worth a peek if your a Pat fan. Wish the movie was a little braver to explore other themes but it stuck to the gender bender confusion til the end. 3 stars as it was ok but certainly a missed opportunity.",1439769600,,479,3.8979591836734695

635461,1,6303383319,"This is a terrible, boring, unfunny movie.

I would have turned it off, but I kept waiting for Pat's gender to be revealed -- but it never was.

I also was waiting for some kind of explanation, which never happened. So, my own explanation would be that Pat was born as a hermaphrodite, which is someone with genitalia of both male and female, so that the baby cannot be identified as either male or female, and over the years, some kinds of surgeries and hormonal treatments are done to ""assign"" the baby to one gender (usually female, because it is easier for the surgeons).  Anyway, this was supposed to be a comedy, not a drama (and I didn't laugh, not even once).",1421798400,,667,4.450819672131147
635462,5,6303383319,"This movie is severely underrated. It holds up very well...actually, it's gotten better with age. It's the kind of weird that wasn't appreciated back then but would be now (people love weird, nonsensical stuff these days). Seriously I do recommend this film for slapstick/nonsensical weirdness/90s fans.",1413158400,2,303,5.608695652173913
635463,2,6303383319,"I think this could have been improved if the film had stuck with one plot, but it opts for three. I liked the dark thriller end with Pat's neighbor getting obsessed, and I wish they'd delved into that a bit more. The only time the film's grammar gets any bit interesting is toward the climax of that. The humor is pretty much what you'd expect in just another SNL sketch (not a best of sketch).

I watched this because Tarantino has an uncredited rewrite, and it has a Camille Paglia cameo. Camille is in it for literally all of one second, and the parts Tarantino is responsible for remain unconfirmed, but it feels like the dark stalker elements are his.",1407715200,3,656,4.466666666666667
635464,1,6303383319,"I really tried to like this movie.  It had a few high points, but just a few.  I always enjoyed SNL when Julia was on the show and Pat was one of her best characters.  However, this movie wore through the carpet to the pad below.  They literally exhausted everything that could be considered good about the character.  Pat was so out of touch that she literally became irritating.  I ended up not liking her at all and couldn't wait for the movie to end.  I was on my tablet 2/3 of the way through, while my girlfriend continued to watch.  Its unfortunate for Ms. Sweeney that she left a great show to do such a lame project.

635519,1,6303383319,"On Saturday Night Live, the ""It's Pat"" skits were always funny.  The movie, however, was not.  Yes, it is a very bad idea to take a few minute sketch and try to stretch the joke into a 90 minute movie.  While it's is not a great movie it is pretty funny at times.  Especially the neighbor who becomes so very psycho obsessive in trying to discover Pat's gender.",1072742400,7,361,4.264705882352941
635520,1,6303383319,"Ouch. I just got done watching ""It's Pat: The Movie."" Actually, I saw it three years ago and am still recovering. This movie has gone down in history as one of the worst films ever to be made. The comedy, which is as funny as ""Schindler's List,"" works so hard at producing so little. The plot is a one-joke premise and the joke is funny for less than a heartbeat, then it gets stale and old. Is Pat a man or a woman? Does anyone care after this film? I don't think so. By the end, we still don't know what Pat is, and I don't think anyone is really all that interested to find out. By the way, Pat's played by a woman, Julia Sweeney, who's funnier in everything else she's ever been in.",1044748800,13,686,4.088888888888889
635521,5,6303383319,"When my best friend and I were roomates, this was one of our favorite movies to watch  a couple times a month and recite the words throughout the whole movie. I'm sure this did drive people crazy who were hanging out at our house because we were in our own little world of Pat laughing our a**es off. My favorite lines from this movie include Pat squelching ""I crushed my nuts!"" when Pat tumbles down the stairs. The neighbors exchange knowing glances until Pat says ""There goes my afternoon snack!"" exposing the crumbled walnuts in Pat's hand. It's hilarious to watch Pat's neighbor Kyle become psycho obsessed with Pat too. I think this is an excellent movie to watch with friends. Or maybe I'm just easily amused!",1024790400,17,716,4.637795275590551
635522,1,6303383319,"This is, quite simply, one of the worst films ever made.  Long, boring, stupid, and not funny at all.  The character of Pat is funny in the brief SNL skits, but can't hold together for a (almost) feature-length film.",1022976000,4,216,4.512820512820513

We think ""It's Pat"" is one of the most unique and talented story lines of the nineties. I mean, taking one androgynous character and making it fall in love with another? That's sheer genious! And then shuffling the weird, obssesive neighbor (Kyle) into the mix? Who thought of that? They should be rewarded!! We have dedicated all of our free time into the research of Pat and Pat fans everywhere. The fan club is coming soon and we hope to hear from anyone whose been enlightened by Pat!

After about an hour, I couldn't stand watching it any more.  In fact, the only reason I continued to watch it was because I hoped to at least find out Pat's gender.

It just keeps getting more and more annoying as the ""story"" goes.  It's  not really a story but more like a bunch of sketches strung together.  I  would have given this movie zero stars but I couldn't.  Unless you like  really really bad movies or are a big fan of the It's Pat sketch(which,  even if you are I think you will be disappointed) avoid this movie.
