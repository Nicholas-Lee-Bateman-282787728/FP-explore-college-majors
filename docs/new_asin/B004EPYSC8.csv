4365694,5,B004EPYSC8,"This is one of the finest and most intelligent series sever made. Regrettably, the foreign version which we could play because we have a universal DVD player didn't have subtitle for e hearing impaired in English, only in Dutch.",1327622400,5,228,4.871794871794871
8427598,1,B004EPYSC8,"The DVD's would not play.  My others play just fine, so it was something particular to these DVD's.  When I put the disc in the player, the screen flashed ""Check location code.""  I have no idea what that means.  I would gladly re-purchase these DVD's if you can tell me how to play them.",1509148800,,287,4.2592592592592595

8427601,5,B004EPYSC8,"This series is superb. Each show explores an interesting legal case and/or social issue. Complex characters and issues that are current and difficult. Our judge is usually on an easily determined ethically justified position, but not always. Sometimes it's not so clear. The government is the bad guy--usually the government or opposition forces are portrayed as evil buffoons, but there is still plenty of gist in the plot to chew over. Very enjoyable show.",1436572800,,458,5.202702702702703

8427605,4,B004EPYSC8,"THE STORIES ARE WELL WRITTEN AND INTRIGUING....THE PRIMARY CHARACTERS ALTHOUGH HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, ARE BELIEVABLE.  THEY HAVE HUMAN WEAKNESSES LIKE ALL HUMANS, AND THUS ONE CAN FEEL SOME COMPASSION EVEN FOR THE LEAST LIKABLE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE HEROES AND HEROINES.",1366848000,,296,5.7272727272727275
8427606,5,B004EPYSC8,"Judge John, Jo, Charlie and the whole gang take on topical controversial cases once again.  The series has been wonderfully produced, directed, filmed and acted.  I believe Seasons 5 and 6 are the very last, and I shall miss them all.  Be aware that these two DVDs are in PAL format and therefore unplayable on American equipment that lacks built in decoding to NTSC.  You have to get an inexpensive conversion program to do this, or as in my case have a guru for a friend!",1334361600,7,473,4.465116279069767
8427607,1,B004EPYSC8,"Copyright screen, several studio braging screens, endless advertisements (in Dutch probably).  All buttons disabled.  After several minutes, we gave up and tossed it in the garbage.  Do they really think the advertisements are going to make me want to buy another DVD with endless advertisements?  If you really want this, mine is free in the landfill.  I won't try to sell it, out of kindness to others.",1328572800,2,404,4.970149253731344
