8125423,5,B000FPLT78,A good book that will help many. Colossians 1:8 says don't let anyone spoil you with their vain philosophy. This book is good at exposing poor ideas.,1476748800,,149,4.555555555555555
8125424,5,B000FPLT78,"This  DVD is the perfect answer to both the book and the movie, The Da Vinci Code and if you have questions about the veracity of the statements made in the book and the movie. In fact I don't think Dan Brown wanted to commit heresy. Instead all he wanted to do was to sell a million copies of his book and he used a time-tested trick - ""Controversy"". And was he successful? So successful was the book that it was even made into a movie. I feel sorry for all Christians who took part in this movie or the book because it is an insult to their faith, Christ and his legacy. This DVD is a must if you want your School, Church, or religious gathering to get the facts straight and not be misled by the allegations and accusations in the The Da Vinci Code. Christ made a noble sacrifice almost 2000 years ago and he is still remembered and revered for it. Christ is believed in Islam, the Bahai faith and by numerous other saints and prophets from other important world religions such as Hinduism. So I wonder why people, particularly Christians want to go on with such blasphemous controversies about Christ. Anyway Coral Ridge Ministries have done a good job to demistify the intriguing things both the book and movie claim. Don't be misled by the Da Vinci Code rubbish. Instead allow The Da Vinci Delusion to clarify things for you. Let there be TRUTH.",1215216000,5,1351,4.42570281124498
8125425,5,B000FPLT78,"Factional Distortionism is a description of Dan Brown's style in his best-selling book, Da Vinci Code and popular movie of the same name. He takes well known names, places, religious figures and art work and methodically infuses them with myths, legends and popular fiction.

Even if Mr Brown called it fiction it would be troubling. But he boldly calls Da Vinci Code ""factual"" and ""Accurate."" As Dr Kennedy and a world-class line-up of experts show in the Da Vinci Delusion, Mr. Brown is deeply dishonest and clearly unethical.

I strongly recommend this DVD for those who want clarity. Additionally, Tony Robinsons' ""The Real DaVinci Code"" is particularly good.",1170547200,3,663,5.12962962962963
8125426,5,B000FPLT78,"The Da Vinci Delusion (DVD) is a double-threat to Dan Brown's populist heresies. This wonderful documentary equips the saints to defend the faith while at the same time helping them educate and evangelize those who have been seduced by the book/film's Gnostic deceptions. An impressive line-up of historians, theologicans and art scholars refute the claims that Brown makes (one the one hand he says it is a novel and on the other hand he claims that it is based on fact.) A must see for those are are interested in true history. Jerry Johnson, Director, The Apologetics Group",1149379200,4,576,4.887755102040816
