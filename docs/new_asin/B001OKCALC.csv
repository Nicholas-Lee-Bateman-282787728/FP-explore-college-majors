As far as the seller went- excellent service!",1436832000,,281,4.470588235294118
8330744,5,B001OKCALC,"This is such a sweet, endearing little film. It's one of the first films that KIDS FIRST! endorsed, back in the early 90s and it still holds a warm place in my heart. It is a documentary of sorts, following the life of mama duck and her ducklings who she raises in the pool at an apartment complex in Tokyo. When she first lays her eggs there, and tends to them, she garners international media attention as it gets closer to the time for the young ducklings to hatch. The camera crews gather round and follow the mom and ducks as she teaches them the ways of a duck's world. When one fine day, she decides to take the ducks on a venture, across an 8 lane freeway to the pond on the other side, we see all the ducks ready to go except the littlest one. Patiently, she returns to the apartment pool, day after day until finally, she forces the issues and all the ducks respectfully follow her across the highway to the big pond. The scene is repeated to some degree as mama duck teaches the ducklings to fly. Littlest duck is the last to go and we cheer when he finally figures it all out.
It is a story about motherly love, about nature and imprinting, of persistence and resilency, and of survival of the fittest. That little duck probably became governor years later.
Enjoy.",1312243200,,1276,4.343096234309623
