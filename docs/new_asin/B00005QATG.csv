I don't know about the movie because I have yet to watch it and am thinking of returning it if it were not for the fact the people at the store would think I was a nut. Warner you also need to get out of the dvd iceage with those stupid snap cases. Please bw advised that this is a bad way to to pakage things and if the disc were on the back of the case like the tape it would have not been so bad.",1005955200,,631,3.579710144927536

1646083,5,B00005QATG,"Okay, some peole think Osmosis Jones was a disgusting movie. Well, have you ever seen The Fly? That is ten times more disgusting.
The characters for Osmosis Jones were original and captivating. My favorite was Thrax, the villain. The story line, though used many times for movies, was still a very good one.
The animated parts were spectacular! The characters and backgrounds earned my applause. The live parts looked sadly underfunded and the movie would have done better without them.
And to tell all of you ""macho"" people who won't see an animated movies just because they are cartoons, you guys miss out on the art of animation. This movie was a refreshing change to all those teen flicks and horror movies.",1001980800,,711,4.836065573770492

The kids really like it (although they like pretty much any movie you show them) and they retain a lot of the information which is the important point.

1646835,5,B00005QATG,"This movie is a great way to show kids how your body works to fight off germs and viruses. It is well thought out by being both live action and an animated film. When we are outside of main characters body the film is live action, while inside its animated.
Basically, Frank (played by Bill Murray), doesn't take care of himself.  He is a pretty gross guy. Inside his body is a whole working city. The mayor is his brain, the white blood cells are the cops who work hard to fight the germs who are the bad guys.
One day Frank needs more than just his body to fight of being sick and he has to take medicine that teams up with the cop (white blood cell) to help fight off the infection.

There's only so much BNSG you can watch.  Osmosis Jones is playful and action-packed but still brings home some accurate depictions of how the body operates:  immune systems, motor/sensory neuron action, brain function, homeostasis, digestive function and more.  Even my 5 year old has watched this and gained a better understanding of how her body works and I don't have to worry about her picking up food off the floor and eating it anymore.  Bonus!!",1400457600,,597,5.051020408163265

1646863,4,B00005QATG,"My children and I enjoy this movie for its animation, comedy and anthropomorphic representation of how the human body works.  There is some more mature content but it is subtle and no more sexualized than a more modern Pepe Le Pew cartoon.  In fact, it gave my 8 year old daughter pause to think of how germs and disease are transmitted and developed through uncleanliness and poor eating.  This is a frequently watched movie in our house as it never gets old.",1397001600,,460,4.585365853658536

1646873,5,B00005QATG,"I gave Osmosis Jones a 5 star rating for several reasons. First of all it does an awesome job of riffing the human anatomy.
Bill Murrays portrayal of a generally well meaning person who is fairly un aware of his own grossness is done very well. And It reminds me of how many people I know myself that live life very similar to that character. The characters inside the body are well voiced and the animation is spot on. I watched this twice and liked it better the second time around (which is unusual for me). Its got action, comedy, thrills, chills, and spills. Even a little romance. Its safe for the kids (ok with a fart joke or two) but hey its the human body right?",1390348800,,671,4.291338582677166

1646876,5,B00005QATG,As a treat to my Medical Terminology students for their hard work I bought this film at a student's suggestion and was delighted by it.

Yes. It can be gross.

But.... EVERY year I show this as post semester exam ""relaxation"" day movie and the students love it.
I teach 9th & 12th graders and I have never had one fall asleep during this movie before.
Would I show this to a young child... Probably not. But It has hilarious adult humor in it and even my students caught the witty phases like ""Up spit creek without a paddle"" and the statue of the sperm that says ""Our Founder"" underneath.
I love Osmosis Jones!!!",1387324800,,502,4.340425531914893
1646881,5,B00005QATG,I love this movie! I always watch it with my 10th grade biology students before we start our Human Physiology unit.  It is very accurate when it comes to the body systems and I always refer back to it when I teach about the systems.  They remember so much more after watching it because they can relate back to the story and the characters.  Even though it was made in 2001 it is still funny and surprisingly educational.,1387152000,,421,4.371794871794871

It starts with Bill Murray eating an egg that had landed in some zoo waste. Murray eats the egg although his daughter tells him he will get sick if he does. Then the movie switches to animation showing the job of the white blood cells and other body functions in a great animated story.

I have sent this movie to school for teachers to show for a health lesson. It is hard for children to understand what is happening internally when they get sick. This movie gives them a ""visual"" of the body functions that are working while they are sick. I own this movie on VHS I am definitely buying the DVD. It is as much fun for adults as it is for kids!",1310774400,,698,4.087591240875913
1646931,1,B00005QATG,With respect to people who liked this movie I don't usually write negative reviews but wanted to give parents some warning. We bought this movie for our small daughters thinking the idea animated immune cells fighting germs would be cute but it was really violent. In one scene a character gets strangled to death. Don't get me wrong many cartoons have a little violence like Tom and Jerry chasing around with hammers or Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner with explosives but Osmosis Jones was just way over the top. Kids don't need to see someones eyes bulge out and struggle as they are slowly strangled to death. To show that to little kids is just sick.,1308614400,3,652,4.629310344827586
1646932,4,B00005QATG,"I was introduced to the universe of Osmosis Jones initially through the animated series. It actually wasn't until several years after the movie was released that I finally got around to seeing it. So what is this movie all about?

The movie switches between animation and live action. All the fully animated parts take place within Frank's body. Germs, pills, and white blood cells are anthromorphic creatures who walk and talk like any human. The white blood cells are what run the processes of the body.

The titular character, Osmosis Jones, is such a white blood cell. In the movie, Osmosis, played by Chris Rock, is a police officer (some are firefighters, the mayor, scientists, etc.). He lives in what's referred to inside the body as the City of Frank. Frank, the live action version, is played by Bill Murray and is a zookeeper. Frank is a widowed and ever-disgusting slob and father of a daughter. His daughter, Shane, played by Elena Franklin, is the exact opposite and is a very health-oriented person who is trying to get her father to change his lifestyle.

In the beginning, a monkey steals an egg from Frank. Getting it back, Frank then eats the germed-up egg which allows a deadly virus named Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) to get inside him. Thrax's plan is to kill Frank within three days all the while making it look like the common cold to fool doctors and the citizens of Frank.

However, Osmosis learns of the truth after the mayor gets Frank to take a cold pill, introducing the other main character of the duo, Drix (David Hyde Pierce). Unfortunately, no one believes Osmosis and Drix leaving them to stop Thrax on their own.

Being a nearly 25 year old guy, I could almost say the movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. While it's not an Oscar-winning movie, I always found it to be pretty enjoyable. It's simply a fun kind of movie.

Another thing that's pretty nice is that, while generally a movie for kids, it does have some humor that would fly right over the heads of most children. Like during one scene, a statue can be seen with a plaque reading ""Our Founder"".

The statue is a sperm cell.

So there's humor for everyone.

Is the movie worth checking out? I would say yes, if you love light-hearted and simple fun movies. The great thing is that there was even a follow-up animated series, so if you want to know what happens to Osmosis and Drix, you can always check that out.",1296345600,6,2405,4.600467289719626
1646933,5,B00005QATG,My Grandson has been looking for this for a long time. He is thrilled with the movie. It has been a great transaction.,1287878400,,118,4.173913043478261
1646934,5,B00005QATG,"Osmosis Jones is simply hilarious, despite what the other critics are saying. I read all the one and two-star reviews and I think their outlook on this movie is too immature. After all, it is a big comedy, and it ALSO gives a great insight on the works of the average inner body, which gives you something to think about what might be happening in your own body if you choose to exercise less. It couldn't have been better made, and if I had kids, this movie would be the best way to explain to them the way your body works. Too bad there isn't a sequel!",1286150400,,554,4.186915887850467
1646935,5,B00005QATG,Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) is a hysterical animated adventure of the chaos that occurs inside Bill Murray's body! Bill's character refuses to take care of his health even as his young daughter battles with him to eat right. This bad behavior leads to a nasty cold and the real action starts on the inside of his body as a cold pill (David Hyde Pierce) enters the most dysfunctional internal system ever! This is a favorite movie of all my kids.,1276560000,,444,4.5625
1646936,3,B00005QATG,"this movie in a nutshell, compares the human body [that of frank-bill murray] to a mostly dysfunctional city.  the unlikely hero, a misfit mostly screw-up cop/white blood cell, faces off against an undiagnosed evil invading disease.

while mostly above the understanding of children, it is a relatively clean movie and is an entertaining mix of live action and animation.  osmosis jones provides light amusement without trying to be something its not.",1272844800,,451,5.323943661971831
1646937,3,B00005QATG,"I like that this movie provides a humorous but fairly accurate view of how the body's immune system works.  It also has a great message about interdependence and taking responsibility.  It has all the bodily humor you would expect - jokes about snot, vomit, farting, belching, etc.  This is a Farrelly Brothers movie, after all.  Adults should be aware that there are two instances of mild cursing (""this damn toe"") and one scene that shows alcohol consumption in front of the main character's teenage daughter.",1271980800,,511,4.976470588235294

It is a about a man named Frank (Bill Murray) who gets an infected toe and a deadly virus (Lawrence Fishburn) tries to kill Frank.  His body is Frank City.  William Shatner plays the corrupt mayor of Frank City.  Niles from Fraiser plays the medicine capsule and Chris Rock is the white blood cell cop.  It is absolutely hilarious and everyone should have this movie in their collection.,1264809600,,446,4.594936708860759

1646941,1,B00005QATG,"I thought the person who told me to go see it was playing a practical joke on me. And I was right. If this was a 30-second promo after an after school special, it would be barely tolerable. As a full-length feature film? For sure, this is what's on constant loop on the flat screens in Hell.",1251590400,,291,4.12280701754386

Now It's Up To The Help of A White Blood Cell Cop Named Osmosis Jones and A Cold Pill Named Drix To Stop Trax From Killing Frank Within 48 Hours.

OSMOSIS JONES is Probly One of The Absolute Best Animated Films Ever Made. Though The Trailers Advertise A Family Film, It's Definatly NOT A Family Film, and I'm Kind of Shocked It Wasn't Rated PG-13.

The Live-Action Cast Aren't As Good As What The ANIMATED VOICE Cast Brings To The Film, But Still Bring The Carecters To Life. The LIVE-ACTION Cast Includes Bill Murray (From GROUNDHOG DAY) as Frank, Molly Shannon (Who Later Did EVAN ALMIGHTY) as Shan's (Frank's Daurghter) Teacher, and Chris Elliot (From THE MASK) as Bob, Frank's Best Friend.

The ANIMATED VOICE Cast Is One of The Best Voice-Over Cast Ever and They Really Bring The Carecters To Life. They Include Chris Rock (Who Later Did MADAGASCAR) as Osmosis Jones, David Hyde Pierce (From BUG'S LIFE) as Drix, William Shatner (Who Later Did OVER THE HEDGE) as The Mayor, and The Best Out of Them All, Lauance Fishburne (From MATRIX) as The Virus Thrax.

The Animation is A Combination of 2D and CGI and It's Absolutly Realistic.

OSMOSIS JONES is A Must-See Film For Older Kids and Adults of All Ages.

SPIECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:
-Commentary By Animation Directors PIET KROON and TOM SITO, Writer MARC HYMAN, and Producer ZAK PENN.
-Frank's Gross Anatomy
-HBO First Look
-Voice Recording Sessions
-Deleted Scenes

The Commentary For OSMOSIS JONES is Another Great Commentary and It's Really worth Spending 95 Minutes Listining To Pepole Who Made The Film. Frank's Gross Anatomy is An Interactive Adventure That Make You Relive ''Gross'' Moments in The Film. The HBO First look is Another Great Making-of That's Worth Watching For 15 Minutes. The Voice Recordings Are Great As Well. The Deleted Scenes Are NOT, and For Once It Makes Sense Why Thay Were Deleted, Mainly It Wasn't That Good, Accturally Only One of Them Was Good.

1646944,5,B00005QATG,"I loved this movie, Chris Rock and David Hyde do a great job and Bill Murray is so funny, I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.",1235952000,,155,3.727272727272727
1646945,3,B00005QATG,"Fun to watch, until Bill Murray comes on screen.  Word to the squeamish...you might want to close your eyes during his scenes.  But the animation is very well done, and the dialogue is very funny if you follow closely.",1219363200,,218,4.564102564102564
1646946,5,B00005QATG,"I first came across this a couple of years ago when it was being shown on the Cartoon Network station in the UK. I'm a big kid at heart, so I thought I would give this a shot. I have to admit, from what I remember I enjoyed it immensely back then. So after going a few years without seeing it, I decided to take the leap and buy it to watch one more time. I have to say that I loved it even more the second time around. I became shocked to find out that this is even a Farrelly brothers production, which gave it that extra comedic boost. The Farrellys famed for comedy classics like Dumb & Dumber and There's something about Mary.

I have seen many reviews with the main negativities being it was either a gross out movie or it was too graphic. Sure, the cartoons show cells being killed in what some would say is quite a brutal way, but that's the realism shining through I guess. If you're going to make an animated movie based around a killer virus, then it's inevitable that you're going to see cells die. For those who have kids, this is a good way to teach them the realities of life and that not everything is all smiles and sunshine. I don't know, I guess people like their kids to live in a delusional world where everything is A-OK. The gross out scenes, I have to admit became a bit too much even for me. I have a thing for snot and the whole snorting and swallowing thing, so I did skip through that particular scene. There's not doubt that the particular scene in question had a point to it when viewing the animated interior. Another thing that bugged me about the negative reviews was the acknowledgement of innuendo, citing that it's inappropriate. How is innuendo inappropriate? Unless your child is aware of what the innuendo is referring to or the negative reviewer has a dirty mind themselves, then there truly is nothing wrong with a little adult innuendo in a kids movie. A lot of kids TV shows and movies have the odd adult joke here and there, that float harmlessly over the kids head and give the adult a cheap chuckle.

The story focuses around two entities and tells us two separate stories in one fantastic movie. The animated side focuses around Osmosis Jones, a loser white blood cell cop in the city of Frank. One day after Frank swallows an infected boiled egg, he contracts the deadly Red Death virus which embarks on a mission to kill Frank. Determined to prove his worth and after discovering the Red Death virus, Osmosis must fight against the mayors and his departments wishes to locate and stop the virus. He does get a little help from a cold pill by the name of Drexel, who becomes known as Drix. He's uptight and does everything by the book, at least he did until he met officer Jones.
On the outside we are given Frank, a slob zoo worker who's really let himself go since he lost his wife. The only people he has left are his brother Bob (Equally slob like) and his daughter Shane. After eating the boiled egg that was dropped in Monkey poop, he slowly deteriorates, but is determined not to go the hospital or the doctors as he wants to make it to the Buffalo Chicken Wing Festival.

This movie is stocked full of really big names such as Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, Bill Murray, Ron Howard, William Shatner and even a cameo by Kid Rock. How can you honestly go wrong with a movie with such a cast. This is a really enjoyable film that I think can be enjoyed by the entire family. People just need to get over the delusion that a big of harmless innuendo and adult humour is going to kill their child.",1218931200,,3549,4.358006042296073

1646957,4,B00005QATG,"This is a great movie, full of puns, inuendo's and one liners that only being inside a human body could pull off.  It is about a lonely white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (played by kid rock) who is on a body wide search of a suspect virus that no one believes he has seen.  Drex (David Hyde Pierce) is the fast talking, proper cold aid who, after seeing the commitment Jones has, joins him in the search for Thrax (Lawrence Fishburn).  Bill Murry plays the host body, along with Chris Elliot as his best friend.

  This movie has plenty of twists and turns, and the thrills of a live action police movie.  It is relatively medically acruate too.  The reason that it is PG-13 is due to some of the semi-violence, near to bad language, and the inuendos.  Overall, a very funny movie, and if you watch this with a 9-10 year old and explain all of the puns, should be enjoyable for them too, but not really for anyone younger than that.",1160352000,3,935,4.327586206896552

1646959,4,B00005QATG,"Osmosis Jones is a really good movie, if a bit... well... disgusting at times.
The plot revolves around a white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) who serves as a police officer in the body of a guy named Frank (Bill Murray).
When a dastardly virus named Thrax (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) invades Frank's body, it's up to the immunity force to stop him, and Ozzy is teamed up with a cold tablet named Drixobensomedaphedramine, or Drix for short (voiced by the always-wonderful David Hyde Pierce).
Meanwhile, the pompous blood cell politician in charge of Frank's body, Mayor Phlegmming (voiced by William Shatner), is desperate to win the next election, but he is obviously doing a sub-par job of running Frank's body.  His aide (and Ozzy's love interest), Leah, is voiced by Brandy Norwood.

This movie is very amusing in some places, but I had to deduct one star because it is, on occasion, REALLY DARN GROSS.  I had to turn my head away from the screen in some places.  However, this is by no means a bad movie.  I personally consider David Hyde Pierce's portrayal of Drix to be one of the best things in the film (if not the very best), especially when Drix busts a secret mob meeting at a disco and utters the following line, doing some dance steps as he speaks:
""Attention, germs, you are surrounded.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, SURROUNDED!"".  Trust me, it's worth seeing just for that part.

Overall, Osmosis Jones is definitely worth seeing, and it could also be used to teach an anatomy lesson, because it's very accurate.  Just watch out for the gross bits.",1124064000,13,1595,4.725631768953068

1646966,5,B00005QATG,"Osmosis Jones is one of those movies you almost feel like you have to apologize for liking.  Well, forget about it, because this is a very funny and downright entertaining movie with no class whatsoever!
The scenes bounce between live acting and full animation, determined by whether we are outside or inside the body of Frank.  The casting for this silly and peculiar movie was expertly chosen for both live and voice roles.
Live, we have Bill Murray as Frank, in his most disgusting character since Caddyshack.  Chris Elliot plays his brother Bob, and manages to challenge Murray in the ""disgusting slob"" category.  Murray eats a hard boiled egg that landed in monkey doodoo, and thus introduces Thrax into his body, a red-death virus determined to take over Frank and kill him. (voiced by Laurence Fishburne)
Inside of Frank, we go to the animation where Chris Rock is the voice of our hero, a white blood cell named Osmosis Jones.  Jones is a detective for the City Of Frank, where William Shatner does the voice for Mayor Phlemming.  Jones knows something is wrong, but the Mayor denies any illness could occur in Frank.  But just to be safe, he ""manually overrides"" Frank and has him take a cold pill.
Meet Drix, the huge and snotty cold pill, whose voice is played by David Hyde Pierce (Frazier's brother Niles).  Jones and Drix make an unlikely team as they hunt down Thrax and try to stop him from killing Frank.
Nothing is taboo here; they go to the nose and get caught up in the wave of snot when Frank's allergies act up, they travel to The Zit, Frank's hottest new club where Kidney Rock is playing (Kidd Rock), and Jones reminisces about the time he hit the ""Panic Button"" in Frank's stomach, causing him to vomit all over his daughter Shane's teacher. (played live action by Molly Shannon)
Boogers, snot, vomit, farts, and zits; its all here.  Ron Howard even does a guest voice as Tom Colonic, running for Mayor against Phlemming, who broadcasts his campaign commercial from The Bowels.
This is visceral entertainment with a squishy feel to it, riotously funny and well endowed with toilet humor; silly campy comedy at its very best.  In David Litton's excellent review below, he mentioned that this was a ""Fun Time-waster"".  Indeed it is, David.  Enjoy!",1085961600,26,2270,4.748091603053435
1646967,3,B00005QATG,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought: how neat, a fun and educational way for kids to learn about how the human body works. I'm glad I watched it first on my own, though, because I'm not sure I'd let any children of my acquaintance watch this. At least not the young ones.
I think the movie would have been better without any of the live action characters (Bill Murray, Chris Elliott, etc.) for two reasons. First of all, they're just disgusting. Too disgusting. It got to the point where I'd watch all of Bill Murray's scenes with my hands over my face, peeking between my fingers. Between the running snot, exploding pimples, and ingrown toenails, the ""gross-out factor"" just goes way, way over the top. To me, it stopped being amusing and became just repugnant early on. Like, his first scene.
Second, I think the final scenes, when Bill Murray ends up in the emergency room, are far too intense for younger viewers. He basically dies on the table in front of his young daughter (Elena Franklin), who's led away sobbing by nurses. He comes back from the brink of death, of course, and all ends well, but it's still pretty traumatic and graphic.
The animation sequences, however, are just wonderful. Bill Murray's character is the ""City of Frank,"" complete with a police force (the white blood cells, featuring Chris Rock), a highway system, airport (Frank's stomach), and even a political campaign (with William Shatner as the incumbent mayor in ""Cerebellum Hall"" and Ron Howard as his challenger). The whole city system inside Frank was a really clever idea and very well executed. David Hyde Pierce is also wonderfully ""uncool"" and fussy as over-the-counter cold pill, Drix (""I was developed at the University of Chicago, where I graduated Phi Beta Capsule""). It's a whole new take on the ""good cop, bad cop"" movies.
All this having been said, I'm pretty sure I would watch thie movie again, but I'll be fast forwarding through the live action sequences. Just cartoon germs for me, thank you.",1072569600,9,2004,4.778097982708934

The movie touches on health and human physiology in a fun way that will encourage kids to learn more. It is also based around family members caring for each other. Whenever one of our kids is home sick from school this is a good movie to pop in to pass some of the fevered time.
As far as the vomit goes (pun intended) what do you think would happen if you unwittingly ate polluted oysters??!!

1646974,2,B00005QATG,"...this movie was a huge mistake. The audience I saw it with was largely quiet and seemed as uninvolved in it as I was. About the only thing going for it is the vocal talent (Rock, Fishburne, Pierce, Shatner) but even that ended up being disappointing.
The concept just doesn't work. There's a major disconnect between the live action sequences with Frank (Bill Murray) in the real world (which make up perhaps 1/3 of the movie) and the animated sequences of what's going on inside his body. For me, this very cartoony anthropomorphic world of his internal organisms (the animation design reminds me of the Simpsons a little bit) just cannot possibly exist at all in the real world...yet we are supposed to believe that Frank's white blood cells look like Smurf/Bart Simpson hybrids and sound like Chris Rock...it was just impossible for me to suspend my disbelief as the film cuts back and forth between these two completely different universes.
That said, I guess the filmmakers do what they can with it, the way they visualize the city of Frank (the inhabitants refer to his brain as Cerebellum Hall, the armpits are where all of the evil bacteria and viruses hang out and veins are shown as busy highways) is somewhat clever but, again, entirely too fantastic to exist in the real world. And then when these wholly disparate worlds collide, and the animated micro-organisms are literally travelling from one person to another AND THEN BACK AGAIN via phlegm and tears in the real world...well, that's when the impossible becomes TOTALLY LUDICROUS.
And it doesn't help that all of the live-action actors (notably Murray, Molly Shannon and Chris Elliott) appear to just be collecting paychecks. Murray has achieved a new low here...I enjoyed his recent turns in `Rushmore' and `Charlie's Angels' but this is just plain embarrassing for him. The Farrelly brothers just must've told him to be as disgusting and slovenly as possible, which is fine I guess but that's all he has to do in this and what a waste of his talent. And the result is we just don't care about his character...he's repugnant and an idiot. So what if the Thrax (the virus) causes him to die? The audience feels no sympathy towards Murray and that is the fatal flaw of the film.
And really, I expected more of Rock...there are a couple of scenes where it looks like he was able to improvise and do his thing but for the most part the filmmakers keep him on a pretty short leash and stick to the script, and I really think that an opportunity may have been missed there. Used properly, I think Rock could do great voice-overs for animated films.
Oh yeah, one more thing...why can't a comedic film come out without some dumb film parody in it? You've seen the action in the Matrix parodied a million times already...well add another attempt (very feeble at that) to the list. It's really getting annoying, and pedestrian animated films like this one really have no new insights to add as far as that parody goes. They should leave that to more insightful programs such as Simpsons and South Park.
One final note...I had this weird feeling when I walked out of the theater...as if the film just didn't work, and I knew the movie reminded me of another, but I couldn't remember what at first. Then it came to me...remember `The Last Action Hero'? That film left me with that same feeling, because Arnold Schwarzenneggar plays the role of a movie character that comes to life in the real world. It was just totally impossible to believe and renders the film - no matter how well it's done and how well everything else is conceived - toothless. And Osmosis Jones falls flat for the same reason. Audiences can suspend their disbelief...but only to a certain point.",1016496000,,3726,4.725038402457757
1646975,5,B00005QATG,"I guess the film didn't do big guns at the box office, and with the new animation Oscar category, this one was bypassed.  I'm not sure why, because this one works for me in so many ways. My kids likes the animated characters and the various chase scenes.  But it's for adults, also, as a lot of time was spent creating humorous ways to set up various internal body systems.
The live action, which takes up about 1/3 of the movie, does not live up to the animation.  But Bill Murray does his usual solid job portraying a guy who is doing just about everything he can to mess up his body.
What made it special for me, though, was the reactions I received while we watched it.  My four children range from 3-8 years old.  They were all mesmerized by it, and I got a non-stop barrage of questions from them throughout the entire movie about explaining what what happening in various parts of the body.  I don't consider this confusion, but a genuine interest in the movie.

Enter white blood cell detective Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) and sidekick Drix, a super-hero-like cold pill, who set out to stop Thrax. A light-hearted movie, I would have said 'Osmosis Jones' would be appropriate for kids; however, some scenes are violent and intense enough to make me question that thought.

William Shatner is the voice of the self-involved and corrupt mayor of the body politic (ha).  I liked Shatner's voice in this film, but for some reason I kept seeing Rip Torn-go figure.

TV's Niles Crane, that is, Frasier's brother, David Hyde Pierce voices the role of the Mr. Spock/Data character, a nerdy, by-the-book, robotic cold pill sent in to partner with Jones.  So you've got the animated cop buddy pic angle goin' on.  At first encounter, Pierce as the cold pill doesn't work, but the character does improve as the film goes on.

The film is more or less harmless, although a great deal of its best humor is lost on kids younger than ten, as they have no knowledge of the anatomy which forms the basis of the jokes.  There are some funny gags for grownups down inside Frank, but they are too fleeting, too quick, almost designed for DVD playback.

But actually, this movie is a unique comedic gem, and is unexpectedly clever.
For example, if you were to watch one of the trailers, you might see the part where a little green germ says ""Oh, no, not again!"" in an amazingly unfunny voice. From that clip, anybody older than 12 would probably groan. When viewed in the context of the movie, though, the line is actually funny.
As everybody else who's written a review will tell you, the animated scenes are far better than the live action sequences. I'm hoping that if we all say it a lot, then you'll remember. The animation is absolutely wonderful, while the live-action scenes are merely average. The Farelly brothers, evidently, have a special talent to be heavy-handed and immature. However, these scenes are not so bad that they ruin the movie. They are somewhat enjoyable and not entirely bad. But when placed next to the adventures of Osmosis Jones, you might be inclined to hate them.

  This is the story of a guy named Osmosis Jones, a white blood cell voiced by Chris Rock.  He lives inside the body of Frank, a slobby zookeeper who's body is likened to a city: it has it's dump (guess where), power plant (heart), ghetto (liver), and even natural disasters (cramps and sicknesses.)  So when Frank injests a hard boiled egg that has been in the mouth of a monkey and on the ground, it's bad news.  Especially when the egg hosts the Red Death virus named Thrax (my favorite character), voiced superbly by a evilly suave and utterly unrecognizable Laurence Fishburne.  Thrax wants to kill Frank in record time (48 hours) by damaging his hypothermis gland and heating Frank up like ""A sidewalk on a summer day..."" Thrax snickers.
  To help Osmosis fight Thrax, enter the by-the-book and not particularly bright cherry-flavored cold pill Drix (David Hyde Peirce)who wants to prove his worth by curing Frank.
  The In-Jokes, such as taking you're girlfriend down to the kidneys to see the stones and an armpit being a sauna for gangsters make it funny.  The live-action parts are disgusting with vomit jokes and require fast forwarding.  And the action scenes near the end, involving car chases and fistfights, are just cool.  It's a little violent within the body; Thrax's sicle-like index finger is used for slicing apart those unfortunate cells that stand in his way and for setting fire to his surroundings.

To save Frank, the white germ kills the virus, and puts the body tarm. in the right place, so Frack is saved, but still he was almost a goner, the white blood cell his happy and respected, and Frank is doing exerizes. There are more stuff, like that there is a mayor inside Franks head, and more, but I told you the main stuff. I don't want to ruin everything for you. Drewing, is very good, they druw the characters well:8.5/10 Fun, there are some good parts and some bad parts, I would say there are more good parts:7/10 Movieplay, this is a good-sized movie:9/10 Overall, Osmosis Jones is very good:8.5/10",1006646400,,907,4.218390804597701
1646986,3,B00005QATG,"Movie Summary:  Osmosis Jones is a white blood cell in the body of Frank. He is a cop who defends Frank from invading germs. Frank is a disgusting human being who eats a hard boiled egg from the floor of a monkey's cage and in the process ingests a nasty virus named Thrax. Jones is the only cop who is on to Thrax's evil plan to kill Frank in record time. Jones gets help from an over the counter cold pill named Drix and together they fight to save Frank's life.
My Opinion:  The animated portions of the movie were entertaining and fun. The live action portions of the film were gross and not that funny. If it had been 95% animation, this would have been a lot better film. As it is, its audience would be mostly teen and pre-teen boys who are into the gross out humor. Bill Murray's character is disgusting and very hard to like. He doesn't treat his daughter very well. He comes across as very unsympathetic. In the animated portions, all the characters are well done. Chris Rock does an excellent job as Jones. He's funny and you end up rooting for him. David Hyde Pierce is perfect as Drix the cold pill. They make a surprisingly good team. Laurence Fishburne and William Shatner round out the excellent animated cast. If only they could have toned down the live action parts and made Frank more likable. Then we'd probably have a hit on our hands.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1 Animation is very crisp and clear. Sound:  DD 5.1 The dialog is quiet and the music is loud.  Extras:  Commentary, Trailers, Behind the Scenes Documentary, Deleted Scenes, Hidden Clip  Menus: Average Animated Menus. This is a decent DVD release with a fair amount of extras.
What You Should Do:  Rent it if you've got some teen age boys in the house. The animated portion of the story is great, but the live action scenes can get pretty gross.
